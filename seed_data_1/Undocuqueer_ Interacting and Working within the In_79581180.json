Participants ascribed three overarching self-meanings: \nVulnerability, Complexity, and Resilience. These self-meanings describe the ways \nparticipants perceived the interplay of their gender, sexuality and immigration status \nwithin the current sociopolitical context of the U.S. Recognizing their vulnerability \nwithin a state of illegibility, participants described a sense of exclusion within spaces of \nbelonging, and wariness managing relationships with others; opting for more complex \nself-definitions, they resisted simplistic conceptions of identity that rendered their social \nlocations invisible (e.g., homonormativity, heteronormativity, DREAMer); and \ndescribing themselves as resilient, they described surviving societal as well as familial \nrejection even when surviving seemed impossible to do so. Interacting and working \nwithin the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status, participants described \nidentity negotiation and coming out as a form of resistance to institutionalized \noppression, and resilience amidst simultaneous anti-immigrant, xenophobic and \nheterosexist power structures. Participants learned to live in multiple worlds at the same \ntime, and embrace the multiplicity of their undocuqueer identity while seeking to bridge \ntheir communities through stories, activism and peer education. This study has \nimplications for further understanding the way that queer politics and identity interact/ \nrelate with various axes of inequality. \n \n  \n \t\r  ii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n

As an LGBT mainstream movement \nyou are not recognized. As an immigrant movement, you are not recognized and \nyou are the negotiating piece. We are always the negotiating piece, and our lives \nare not to be negotiated. Why is it that we are always the negotiating piece, and \nwhy is it that in our lives we have to be okay with that?  \nIn this way, Jesse, an undocuqueer activist from Arizona, describes his experience \nnavigating the cultural intersection of his (homo)sexuality and immigration status. His \nnarrative highlights the unique position lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer \n(LGBTQ) undocumented immigrants in the U.S. often find themselves in, given the \npolitization and commodification of their experiences within mainstream LGBTQ and \nimmigrant rights discourses. \nThough the last couple of years have witnessed accomplishments for the LGBTQ \nrights movement, as well as administrative successes for the immigrant rights movement, \nLGBTQ undocumented immigrants remain on the fringes of these victories. Discourses \naround marriage equality, for example, limit rights based upon citizenship (Chávez, 2010; \nQueers for Economic Justice, 2007). Individuals cannot petition for their same-sex \nspouses through family based immigration processes unless one of them has citizenship. \nThis agenda, hence, does not benefit undocumented immigrants who are single, \nunmarried or not in a relationship with a U.S. citizen. Restrictive eligibility requirements \nand the limited number of visas available per year, further, make undocumented \n \t\r  2 \nimmigrants who entered the U.S. without inspection ineligible to adjust their immigration \nstatus, even if married to a U.S. citizen (see Arellano, 2012; Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996). \nLikewise, within the immigrant rights movement, politics of deservingness \nstrategically place undue emphasis on normative ideologies that limit rights based on \nheterosexism (Queers for Economic Justice, 2007). Positioning families and DREAMers \nas American in every way except on paper, these discourses frame undocumented \nimmigrants within the dominant values of heterosexuality and gender conformance; \nhence, rejecting deviant expressions of normative nationalist ideals (e.g., lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, gender nonconforming). A pathway to citizenship that does not \nrecognize the distinct barriers facing the more than 267,000 LGBTQ-identified \nundocumented immigrants in the U.S. would thereby not guarantee equal access to relief \n(Gates, 2013). \nThough LGBTQ and immigrant rights are at the forefront of political debates \ntoday, there is little discussion among scholars of how immigration status is an issue for \nLGBTQ people, and how sexuality and gender disruption similarly implicates the \nexperiences of immigrants. Both movements, which are largely understood to be \nseparate, have generally advocated a politics of inclusion in and assimilation to \nmainstream national values, utilizing normalizing discourses of belonging to frame their \nissues (Chávez, 2010, 2013). The tendency to present each movement in terms oriented to \nthe dominant culture has resulted in the exclusion and disenfranchisement of individuals \nwho find themselves outside of normative conceptions of dominant nationalist scripts.  \n \t\r  3 \nBecause mainstream LGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks delink sexuality \nand immigration status, “the study of sexuality and immigration remains marginalized, \ntrivialized, depoliticized, or treated with hostility” (Luibhéid, 2004, p. 227). As \nresearchers look at issues of LGBTQ and immigrant rights separately, we have no \nappreciation for the lives or experiences of individuals outside of these normative \nconceptions of what it means to be LGBTQ and what it means to be undocumented. \nSocial movement scholars have critiqued unitary-identity social movements for their \nexclusion of a mass number of constituents, support of the matrix of domination by \naddressing one form of inequality but not others, and failure to recognize the complex \nmechanisms behind the inequality they intend to address (Kurtz, 2002). For this reason, \nthe study of LGBTQ and immigrant rights must challenge multiple hierarchies at once or \nelse risk benefiting only those who already benefit from some structural privileges \n(Luibhéid, 2008). \nUndocuqueer has emerged as a coalitional political identity that has been made \npossible through the lived experiences of LGBTQ undocumented youth (Corrunker, \n2012; DasGupta, 2012; Gutierrez, 2012, 2013; Wong, Shadduck-Hernandez, Inzunza, \nMonroe, Narro, & Valenzuela, 2012). Out of the closet and no longer living in the \nshadows (Chávez, 1997), undocuqueers destabilize notions of collective identity by \nhoning in on the complexity of navigating intersectional identities, and the power of \ncreating something new within the contradictions. Their self-defined standpoints provide \nan alternative formation of identity that disrupts unitary identity politics within the larger \nLGBTQ and immigrant rights discourses. Undocuqueer, as a discursive formation, \nthereby not only critiques dominant LGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks, but also \n \t\r  4 \nproduces alternate subjectivities and subject positions that resist multiple axes of \noppression within a matrix of domination (Collins, 2000). \nUndocuqueers campaign for administrative relief inclusive of LGBTQ \nimmigrants; advocate for the rights and protections of LGBTQ immigrants within \ndetention facilities; and conduct double coming out forums challenging essentialized \nconceptions of identity (Portillo, 2012). The experience of organizing for LGBTQ and \nimmigrant rights organizations that challenge current laws and policies has provided the \nimpetus for coming out “undocumented and unafraid, queer and unashamed” (Lerner, \n2012). Undocuqueers have tapped into the common thread of confronting fear, and have \nplayed a prominent role in both the movement toward marriage equality as same-sex \nbinational couples, and as DREAMers in the movement toward immigration reform \n(Campbell, 2012; Shore, 2013). Yet to speak and be heard in ways that will not \nimmediately invite the most serious of repercussions (e.g., rejection, discrimination, \ndetention, deportation) is a challenge that undocuqueer activists face in ways that other \npopulations with a direct stake in U.S. legislative battles do not. Because these activists \nare positioned at the overlapping margins of two single-variable identity-based social \nmovements pursuing conflicting political agendas that fail to adequately represent them, \ntheir positionality as LGBTQ undocumented immigrants in the U.S. represents an \nimportant borderland that commands greater attention. \nPurpose of study \nThere is a body of literature encompassing the experiences of LGBTQ activists \nfrom diverse backgrounds (Alimahomed, 2010; Moore, 2010; Pastrana, 2010; Stone, \n2009; Swank & Fahs, 2011, 2012; Taylor et al., 2009; Waldner, 2001), as well as \n \t\r  5 \nLGBTQ activists’ collective identity and motivations for high-risk activism (Ghaziani, \n2011; Jones, 2002; Vivienne & Burgess, 2012).  Moreover, there is a separate body of \nliterature encompassing undocumented activists’ motivations for becoming civically \nengaged (Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, & Cortes, 2010), the effects of storytelling \nthrough digital media (Zimmerman, 2012), and the effects of engaging in political \nadvocacy (Gonzalez, 2008; Morales, Herrera, & Murry 2011; Negron-Gonzalez, 2013). \nWith notable exceptions, empirical research specifically focused on the intersections of \nsexuality and immigration status, or LGBTQ undocumented immigrants’ experiences and \nperspectives are limited (for exceptions, see Acosta, 2008; Canaday, 2003; Cantú, 1999, \n2009; Chávez, 2011; LaFountain-Stokes, 2005; Luibhéid, 2002; Luibhéid & Cantú, 2005; \nManalansan, 1994, 2003, 2006; Peña, 2007; Somerville, 2005).  \nThough the limitations to legal U.S. entry are replete with deep heteronormative \nassumptions, previous scholarship virtually ignores LGBTQ undocumented immigrants’ \nexperiences, and the connections among sexuality, immigration status and normativity \n(Heller, 2009; Lubheid, 2002, 2004). Related research has explored the specific legal \nexperiences of LGBTQ migrants as they pertain to asylum on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender identity, the rights of HIV positive people who want or need to \nmigrate, and the limitations of family-based immigration benefits pre-United States v. \nWindsor (Cheng, 2006; Hanna, 2005; Holt, 2004; Human Rights Watch & Immigration \nEquality, 2006; Luibhéid, 2008; Rank, 2002; Wygonik, 2004-2005). Though related, \nthese studies neglect to unpack the uniqueness of living as an LGBTQ undocumented \nimmigrant within the sociopolitical context of the U.S., or being politically excluded \nfrom representation within LGBTQ and immigrant rights advocacy frameworks \n \t\r  6 \nsimultaneously. For these reasons, the purpose of this study is to (1) explore the way \nundocuqueer activists make sense of the intersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented \nexperiences, and (2) via their personal narratives, understand how they interact and work \nwithin the various social systems that simultaneously exclude them.  \nSignificance of Study \nImmigration and sexual politics in the U.S. are two of the most divisive issues at \nthe center of major policy and civil rights discussions today. Both have contributed to the \npolarization of our nation around issues of marriage, adoption, employment non-\ndiscrimination, higher education, healthcare and immigration reform.  Because \nundocuqueer activists fall outside of essentialized conceptions of what it means to be \nLGBTQ and what it means to be undocumented, their views of reality differ from, are not \na part of, or have not been fully captured by hegemonic discourses. The coming together \nof two self-consistent but habitually incomparable frames of reference causes a cultural \ncollision (Anzaldúa, 1987) producing dissident knowledge that resists normative \nconceptions of dominant discourse. In this respect, understanding undocuqueer activists’ \nexperiences—different from both LGBTQ and undocumented activists—provides \nlocalized and specific knowledge that attends to the complexities of gender identity and \nexpression, sexuality and immigration status. Their narratives help work against the \nconsistent erasure of their experiences and perspectives at the overlapping margins of two \nsingle-variable identity-based social movements. Rendering these intersectional social \nlocations visible, hence, is politically and culturally powerful for those working with and \nwithin LGBTQ and immigrant rights organizations.   \n \t\r  7 \nPrevious research has looked at both LGBTQ and undocumented activists and \ntheir respective movements separately, acknowledging the blatant disregard for \nindividuals/communities residing at the margins and overlaps of structural forms of \noppression (Ferry, 2012; Ghaziani, 2011; Muñoz, 1999; Nicholls, 2013; Ruiz, 2008; \nUnzueta Carrasco & Seif, 2014; Zimmerman, 2011). This study moves these conceptual \nmargins to the center of analysis in an effort to explore and understand the way that queer \npolitics and identity interact/ relate with various axes of inequality. The lack of research \naccorded to studying the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status paints \nan incomplete picture of inequality that demands further theorizing. Understanding the \nway gender identity and expression, sexuality and immigration status affect and shape the \nexperiences of undocuqueer activists is important for charting “the ways in which identity \nis enacted by minority subjects who must work with/ resist the conditions of \n(im)possibility that dominant culture generates” (Muñoz, 1999, p. 6). \nResearch Questions  \nThis study highlights the voices of undocuqueer activists, and is guided by the \nfollowing research questions: \n1. How do undocuqueer activists make sense of the intersection of their LGBTQ and \nundocumented experience?  \n2. How do undocuqueer activists interact and work within the intersection of their \nLGBTQ and undocumented experience? \nMy first question gets more at theorizing personal experience in accordance with \nparticipants’ meaning making, where as my second question addresses the more practical \nlived experiences. In this sense, question two follows and informs question one. With \n \t\r  8 \nthese research questions, I seek to illuminate the Queer Intersectionality of gender, \nsexuality and immigration status. I am interested in exploring the lived experiences of \nundocuqueer activists in terms of how they make sense of their experiences, and interact \nand work within the various social systems that simultaneously oppress them. Given the \npaucity of studies that look at the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status \nfor LGBTQ undocumented immigrants in the U.S., highlighting undocuqueer activists’ \nnarratives may be an important way of moving society towards a more nuanced and \ncomplex understanding of identity, power, resistance and oppression. \nDefinitions \nMy research is guided by the following set of clarifications regarding my use of \nterms and their corresponding interpretations:  \nSex, Gender and Sexuality \nIn the context of the present study, challenging presumed heterosexuality and \ninstitutionalized heteronormativity—the idea that “institutionalized heterosexuality \nconstitutes the standard for legitimate and prescriptive sociosexual arrangements” \n(Ingraham, 1994, p. 204)—is at the root of understanding the relationship between sex, \ngender and sexuality. Accordingly, we must re-imagine sex, gender and sexuality as \ncomplex, diverse, and fluid social constructs rather than biological certainties.  \nHeteronormativity requires the binarization, normalization and naturalization of \nsex and gender difference. Sex categorization activates gendered status distinctions. \nGender, as a normative discourse for sex, is intimately interwoven with sexuality. Hence, \nsex becomes a symptom for sexuality. Because heterosexuality, homosexuality and \nbisexuality are all dependent on similar understandings of sex, when gender resists the \n \t\r  9 \nbinary categorization of man and woman (e.g., transgender, genderqueer, agender, \npangender, gender nonconforming) it simultaneously resists the dominant relationship of \nsex and gender that sexuality is dependent on (Stryker, 2008). For this reason, gender and \nsexuality are not universal, biologically-rooted categories, but instead socially and \nculturally contingent. They help explain how identities are formed by social norms and \nculture, and how individuals can resist the regulation of their identities by transgressing \nboundaries. Although these constructs may appear to be static and fixed, they have \nchanged over time to monitor, control, and discipline us in ways that reflect social, \npolitical, and economic debates and struggles. Foucault (1978) helps us to understand \nhow the expectations regarding gender expression, sexual behavior, and social roles have \nchanged, and how categories have been created to discipline the body across different \neras. Although we may be limited by the materiality of the time and place in which we \nlive, we have choices about acceding to or resisting gender and sexual regulation.  \nQueer Theory demonstrates how gender and sexuality are both negotiated \ncategories, reworked and restructured in each encounter. For the purpose of this study, \nthe term queer will be used to denote same-sex desires and identities, as well as \ntransgender and other gender identities and expressions (e.g., genderqueer) that are \nmarked as deviant and/or nonconforming by heteronormative power structures (Oswald, \nKuvalanka, Blume, & Berkowitz, 2009). Queer serves as a political objection to placing \nheterosexuality and homosexuality in binary categories, and can similarly be used to \nchallenge binaries of masculinity and femininity or to describe oneself as gender \nnonconforming. It refers to living out the notion that we can never adequately identify or \ncodify identity. It is about contingent knowledge whose meanings we must constantly \n \t\r  10 \nreevaluate and reinterpret. It is about being politically, culturally, and socially dissident \n(Cohen, 2001; Talburt & Steinberg, 2000). Queer reveals the possibility of non-\nnormativity in all people, thereby redefining what counts as “normal,” as well as shifting \nthe power dynamics inherent within binary structures (Sedgwick, 1993, p. 27).  \nImmigration Status \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (2012), every person \nadmitted into the U.S. is assigned either an immigrant or nonimmigrant immigration \nstatus. An immigrant status refers to people who have been granted permission to live \nand work permanently in the U.S. without restrictions. A nonimmigrant status refers to \npeople who enter the U.S. on a temporary basis for tourism, business, temporary work, or \nstudy purposes. Each nonimmigrant status has rules and guidelines, which must be \nfollowed in order for the nonimmigrant to remain in status.  \nPersons with an unlawful immigration status are those who (1) entered the U.S. \nwithout inspection or legal permission, or (2) were lawfully admitted but fell out of status \nor their status was revoked per United States Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(USCIS). These persons are considered undocumented because they live in the U.S. \nwithout legal permission. Though undocumented immigrants are protected under certain \nlaws and, in fact, have many rights (Abrego, 2008; Cutin, 2011; Gonzales, 2008; Abrego, \n2011; Seif, 2011), they are always deportable per Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(ICE).  \nActivism \nActivism can be articulated in terms of transgression as a means of resistance. It is \nany intentional action or activity by an individual or a group of actors in opposition to or \n \t\r  11 \nin support of a cause. Its classification as activism is contingent upon its purpose and/or \nthe intention of the actor rather than of the type of activity itself. Activism does not \nrequire actors to be organized. Likewise, it can be both individual and collective, and take \na wide range of forms: petitions, letters, articles, demonstrations, rallies, marches, direct \naction, etc. In this sense, all forms of identity politics can be understood as activism, \nbecause they take the individual to the site of political activity (Taylor & Raeburn, 1995). \nIdentity politics allow marginalized identities to challenge negative descriptions used by \noppressive systems and become normalized. \nOrganization of Dissertation \nThe study is organized into five distinct chapters. In this chapter, I have \nintroduced the topic of inquiry, outlining the purpose and significance of this study. I \nhave similarly identified the research questions guiding this study. In Chapter Two, I \nreview the literature on the context and history of the LGBTQ and immigrant rights \nmovements, honing in on the study of their respective activists. I also describe my use of \nQueer Theory and Intersectionality in the adoption of Queer Intersectionality as the \nframework guiding this study. Chapter Three outlines the study methodology, which \ndraws from narrative inquiry. I also describe the details of the process by which I \nconducted this study and the approach I used to analyze data gathered. Chapter Four \ndescribes the findings that emerged from the data, and Chapter Five provides a discussion \nregarding the way these findings connect with other concepts and bodies of literature. I \nconclude by raising implications for policy and research. \n \t\r  12 \nCHAPTER 2: Review of the Literature \n Inherent to understanding individual’s positionality at the overlapping margins of \ntwo social movements is the centering of their lived experiences within hegemonic power \nstructures. In this chapter, I summarize the politics of LGBTQ and immigrant rights in \nthe U.S. to frame the experiences of undocuqueer activists at the overlapping margins of \nthese two social movements. Doing so, I provide the rationale for exploring gender, \nsexuality and immigration status in relation to each other. I draw from Queer Theory to \nconceptualize identity as a form of dissent from normative structures, then discuss \nIntersectionality as an analytic framework for understanding gender, sexuality and \nimmigration status as interlocking systems of oppression, highlighting accounts of lived \nexperience within those societal power structures. This section concludes with the \nframework undergirding this study, identifying the ways Queer Intersectionality is used \nto explore the lived experiences of undocuqueer activists. \nPolitics of LGBTQ Rights in the U.S. \nFor half a century, LGBTQ rights activists have invoked the language of \nAmericanism (e.g., patriotism, liberty, equality) and appealed to national ideals in their \nstruggle for equal rights (Hall, 2013). While the prominence afforded to the Gay \nLiberation Front, Queer Nation, ACT UP, and similar groups has, at times, worked to \nobscure the appeals to Americanism in the LGBTQ rights movement post-Stonewall, \nsince the 1990s the politic of sexuality has increasingly been about seeking access into \nmainstream culture through demanding equal rights of citizenship (D’Emilio 2000; \nGhaziani 2005; Hall, 2013; Richardson, 2005; Seidman, 2002; Vaid, 1995; Ward, 2008). \nThese approaches have become the dominant political discourse in the U.S.\n \t\r  13 \nsubject of equality is interpreted as equal entitlement to recognition and resources \n(Warner 1999).  \nUnsettling to those who hold transgressive, progressive or radical visions of gay \nliberation, a common justification of these and other demands for social inclusion is that \nLGBTQ persons are ordinary, normal citizens, same as heterosexuals. This tendency to \npresent the movement in terms oriented to the dominant culture has led activists to focus \nconservatively on petitioning rights and recognition (Mucciaroni 2008; Seidman, 2002). \nIn these battles, LGBTQ activists and their allies have continued the tradition of invoking \nAmericanism by deploying language and symbols that resonate powerfully with deep-\nrooted protest traditions that have proven successful in the past (Hall, 2013). Rather than \nchallenge the institutionalization of systems of power that oppress people both as \nindividuals and as a movement, these efforts have promoted a politic that strives for \nconventional citizenship, upholds heteronormative ideas and institutions, and promises a \n“privatized, depoliticized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption” \n(Duggan, 2003, p. 50). With increased political and social assimilation, these issues have \ndiverted our attention from the interrelated nature of oppression and transfixed the \nLGBTQ community with promises of legal and social equality that reinforces existing \nrace, class and gender divisions. Such rights-based organizing ultimately reasserts the \nstate’s authority to make determinations about who should be subject to rights, and who \ncan and should be rightfully excluded (Eng et al., 2005). After all, seeking inclusion \nwithin an exclusive system legitimizes colonial, gender and racial control, and establishes \ndistinctions between “deserving” and “undeserving” people that justify the harm these  \n  \n \t\r  14 \nsystems and institutions perpetuate particularly for queer and trans people of color \n(Spade, 2013, p. 85). \nAccording to Warner (1999), this is precisely the trouble with positioning \nLGBTQ individuals and the broader movement as “normal.” Through assimilation \npolitics, which ignore power and privilege, dominant heteronormative assumptions and \ninstitutions remain unchallenged and unquestioned (Ferry, 2012), LGBTQ identity \nbecomes “privatized” and “depoliticized” (Duggan, 2002, p. 179), and the structure of \nsocial inequality remains materially intact (Jakobsen & Pellegrini, 2003). The desirability \nand necessity of marital-style sexual coupledom, privileged over other forms of \nrelationships of care and support, becomes the basis for many kinds of rights entitlements \n(Wise & Stanley, 2004). This rhetoric of homonormativity, privileges certain forms of \nhomosexual expression and regulates bodies and practices within neoliberal privatized \nnorms. Further, it undermines rather than supports the broader movement for social \njustice and democratic diversity (Duggan, 2002, 2003, 2004; Ghaziani, 2011; Richardson, \n2004).  \nFor this reason, the acronym LGBTQ and the distinctions maintained within this \ngrouping neither effectively communicate information about these groups as a whole or \nindividually (Moraga, 2009; Muñoz, 1999). The assertion of a collective identity \nmarginalizes and excludes those unable or unwilling to conform to it, and similarly \nnegotiates and commodifies the experiences of queer people of color to reinforce and \n(re)produce a false homogeneity (Ferguson, 2003; Muñoz, 1999; Vaid, 2012). Queer \nindividuals that are of color, undocumented, fluid in their sexual expression or gender, or \na combination of such, are often left out of representation (Ferry, 2012; Muñoz, 1999). \n \t\r  15 \nDuggan (2003) warns that the homonormative approach risks squeezing out progressive \nvisions of a more radical LGBTQ rights movement working in concert with workers, \nminorities, and other oppressed or marginalized people. \nLGBTQ activists. While the LGBTQ rights movement has received many critical \nscholars’ attention, studies on the experiences of LGBTQ activists from diverse \nbackgrounds are rare (e.g., Alimahomed, 2010; Moore, 2010; Pastrana, 2010; Swank & \nFahs, 2011, 2012; Stone, 2009; Taylor et al., 2009; Waldner, 2001). Many focus on \nissues of collective identity and/or activists’ motivations for participating in activism \n(Ghaziani, 2011; Jones, 2002; Vivienne & Burgess, 2012); however, these often overlook \nthe ways intersectional identity constructs (e.g., race, gender, immigration status) shape \nactivists’ experiences or perspectives within the movement. \nAmong the exceptions, Alimahomed (2010) found that queer Latinas and \nAsian/Pacific Islander women used their social positions as outsiders within (Collins, \n2004) both the LGBTQ movement and their own racial/ethnic communities to challenge \ntheir invisibility within the representation, politics, and structures of the LGBTQ \nmovement. These women adopted a particular oppositional politic that stressed the \ninterconnectedness of their marked and subordinate identities to produce new and \nresistant meanings and expressions of their identity that interrogated the implicit White \nracial construction of hegemonic queer identity. Moore (2010) similarly describes \nLGBTQ protest within Black environments, and highlights how activists understand and \nnegotiate multiple identity statuses based on race and sexuality. Protest in this context \nused cultural references to connect Black sexual minorities’ struggles to historical efforts  \n  \n \t\r  16 \nfor Black equality, and draw from nationalist symbols and language to frame their \npolitical work. \nOther studies reveal how LGB activists of color often claim feeling like a token \nracial minority at LGB events (Balsam et al., 2011), and express how practices of racism \nare often minimized, or sometimes reenacted, by most wings of the LGBTQ rights \nmovement (Alimahomed, 2010; Levitsky, 2007; Ward, 2008b). Activists’ experiences of \nracism, homophobia, and discrimination within LGBT populations and within their own \nracial group similarly affect their identities and activism. Pastrana (2010) described how \neven though LGBTQ activists of color view their lives as intersectional, certain traits or \ncharacteristics often take precedence over others. Experiences of racism, homophobia, \nand discrimination within LGBT populations and within their own racial group affected \ntheir identities and their activism, but also contributed to such facts as increased visibility \nand ease of access to communities of color. \nSwank and Fahs (2012), who explored activists’ motives for involvement in the \nLGBTQ rights movement, found that publicly revealing one’s sexual identity and \nexperiencing heterosexist discrimination generally increased activism regardless of \ngender and race. White lesbians, however, were less likely to protest and vote than \nlesbians of color. For gay men, experiencing workplace discrimination and embracing an \nactivist identity were especially relevant in predicting activist behaviors. \nThough limited, the existing literature on LGBTQ rights activists most often \nprovides accounts of how the LGBTQ rights movement most often prioritizes the \ndemands of gay men over lesbian women, and White over sexual minorities of color \n(Alimahomed, 2010; Levitsky 2007; Ward 2008b). The scarcity of research focusing on \n \t\r  17 \nLGBTQ activists of diverse backgrounds suggests that this population has not received \nmuch attention for their role-identity as activists within the LGBTQ rights movement. \nPrevious studies presume homogeneity of experience, or simply do not rigorously \ninterrogate interlocking systems of oppression. Likewise, no accounts of undocumented \nactivists’ experiences within the LGBTQ rights movement were identified, despite their \ngrassroots efforts and strong visibility within the fight towards marriage equality as same-\nsex binational couples over the last couple of years. \nPolitics of Immigrant Rights in the U.S. \nFirmly intertwined with the “war on terrorism,” controlling unauthorized \nimmigration to the U.S. has become a top priority, authorizing the expanded \ncriminalization, incarceration, and withdrawal of rights and due process for all migrants \n(Luibhéid, 2008, p. 289). Given an increase in anti-immigrant policies across the nation, \nand the lack of success in passing the DREAM Act1, or comprehensive immigration \nreform in general, the immigrant rights movement has organized around their \nundocumented status to advocate for administrative relief, family reunification, a \npathway to citizenship, and increased access to higher education. Leading to some of the \nmost successful civil rights actions in terms of numbers and geographical breadth (see \nVargas, 2007), the immigrant rights movement has sought to create the necessary tension \nto deal with the systemic problems of state and federal immigration policy. \nUndocumented youth have been some of the most visible at the forefront of these efforts \n(Gonzalez, 2008). \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n1 The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act is a narrowly tailored bill that \nwould allow grant eligible undocumented youth conditional legal status if they attend college or join the \nmilitary to legalize their status in the U.S. Since 2001, the DREAM Act has undergone numerous revisions, \nand has been reintroduced and defeated in every Congress. \n \t\r  18 \nInitially, student issues were not a prominent part of the immigrant rights \nmovements’ broader agenda, but the DREAM Act inspired political participation and \nactivism amongst undocumented youth in unprecedented numbers (Zimmerman, 2011). \nAs youth became organized and individuals began to find comfort in knowing they were \nnot alone, DREAM Act advocacy gave many undocumented youth a means to participate \nin the political process around a matter of direct relevance to them (Gonzalez, 2008). As \na result, national coalitions emerged (e.g., United We Dream Network), coordinating \nundocumented youth organizations across the country and opting for forms of grassroots \norganizing that prioritized undocumented youth leadership and strategies (Zimmerman, \n2011). Despite the dangers involved in speaking out publicly, campaigns based on the \ntactic of coming out—a repertoire used by the LGBTQ movement—have been a \nfundamental mobilizing strategy and collective identification tool amongst undocumented \nyouth, forcing Americans to put a face to the term undocumented (Corrunker, 2012; Seif, \n2004, 2011).  \nThe immigrant rights movement and its respective activists have emerged from \nthe shadows, claiming their own space in the public sphere and asserting their right to \nrecognition—a right to have rights (Nicholls, 2013). Establishing visibility, immigrant \nrights activists transitioned their protests from street marches to civil disobedience, \nputting their bodies on the line, risking deportation by staging sit-ins, occupying \ncongressmen’s offices, blocking ICE facilities and detention centers, and holding hunger-\nstrikes to call attention to their blocked opportunities (Galindo, 2012; Gonzalez, 2008; \nOlzen, 2011; Seif, 2011). The civil disobedience reflects how the immigrant rights \nmovement transitioned and transformed from a movement initially focused on building \n \t\r  19 \nsupport for the DREAM Act, to one that has increasingly used direct action and social \nmedia activism to bring attention to the broader social issues that have largely remained \nhidden from public view (Zimmerman, 2011).  \nStopping the deportation of DREAM Act-eligible youth through administrative \naction represented a strategic shift for the youth-led immigrant rights movement in 2012. \nThe announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)2, and its later \nimplementation, was an unprecedented reflection of the power of their organizing \n(Unzueta Carrasco & Seif, 2014)—a success that these activists championed by \ncultivating the notion of cultural Americanism and deservingness. Cultural Americanism \nhas been the most utilized tactic within the youth-led immigrant rights movement, \noffering undocumented activists an opportunity to reach out and build support on the \nbasis of shared values and ideals (Nicholls, 2013). The aim of this collective strategy has \nbeen to dismantle negative public perceptions and depictions of undocumented \nimmigrants as being “unworthy.” Rather than contest this model of citizenship or assert \nalternative understandings of citizenship, the immigrant rights movement has argued for \nimmigrants’ inclusion in this exclusionary category as model citizens-to-be. This tactic, \nhowever, does little to question the restrictive and highly circumscribed notions of \ncitizenship, as well as conceptions of worthiness that exclude those who do not fit these \ncharacteristics (Baker-Cristales, 2009; Coutin, 2000).  \nDuring legislative campaigns pushing for the passage of the DREAM Act, for \nexample, politicians and advocates argued for the rights of students by placing the blame \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  2\t\r  DACA provides a qualified group of undocumented immigrants an opportunity to apply for temporary \nwork permits and protection from deportation while waiting on Congress to implement their DREAM \n(Arellano, 2012; Richard, 2013).\t\r  \n \t\r  20 \nof their status on their parents, thereby distinguishing who was defined as worthy, \nculpable and deportable (Unzueta Carrasco & Seif, 2014). Though DREAM Act \nlegislation first emphasized why an immigrant with lower priority status warrants \ndeferred action from removal proceedings (Smith, 2013), DACA materialized the divider \nthat separated those undocumented immigrants who were deemed “deserving” from those \nwho were not. Becoming DACAmented, hence, highlighted the different treatment and \nlevels of privilege among undocumented immigrants, and the immigrant rights \nmovement’s responsibility for creating a community that is inclusive of the diversity of \nimmigration experiences (Unzueta Carrasco & Seif, 2014). \nToday, politicians and policy-makers have shifted the debate from \nconceptualizing immigrants primarily as burdens on U.S. society to seeing them as \nsources of criminality and security threats (Baker-Cristales, 2009). Consequently, \nundocumented organizers are moving away from justifying access to rights by measuring \nworthiness according to norms, and moving more towards articulating rights based on the \ncommunity’s needs, thereby shifting definitions of citizenship and deportability. There is \nan increasing awareness within the immigrant rights movement that when activists \n“emphasize the right of some to remain within, they also define who gets left out, \nmarginalized, criminalized and deported” (Unzueta Carrasco & Seif, 2014, p. 289). \nUndocumented activists. Undocumented youth, over the last decade, have \nparticipated in immigrant rights activism in unprecedented numbers, defying stereotypes \nof immigrant youth as being politically powerless. Through civic engagement, they have \nchallenged their societal marginalization and demonstrated their contributions to a society \n \t\r  21 \nthat rejects them (Abrego, 2006, 2008; Galindo, 2012; Gonzales, 2008; Seif, 2004, 2011; \nVélez et al., 2008). \nStorytelling through digital media has been essential in constructing a collective \nidentity for undocumented activists. New media, including Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, \nmicro-blogging, chat rooms, and discussion forums, enable undocumented youth to feel a \nsense of community by connecting and communicating with other youth similarly \nsituated (Zimmerman, 2012). Telling stories about shared struggles and movement \nvictories through user generated videos and blogs have had the cumulative effect of \nincreasing undocumented youth’s sense of belonging, group solidarity and sense of \npolitical efficacy. Corrunker (2012) found visibility through digital media, in addition to \nleadership and deservingness, to be a major source of empowerment for undocumented \nactivists. The moral and persuasive power of their narratives was something they used, to \njustify, explain and make sense of themselves in relation to other people and to the \ncontexts in which they operate. Speaking out further connected them to a large network \nof other undocumented students who share many of the same experiences, challenges, \nand aspirations (Corrunker, 2012). \nAccording to Perez et al., (2010) undocumented students reveal that they are \ndriven to become civically engaged because it serves as an antidote to the political and \nsocial marginalization they face as undocumented students.  Civic engagement—defined \nas providing a social service, activism, tutoring, and functionary work—serves as a way \nto feel a sense of belonging, and allows them the opportunity to affirm themselves as \ngood people and model citizens despite current negative public opinion regarding \nunauthorized immigration (Pérez et al., 2009; Pérez et al., 2010b). In a study of student \n \t\r  22 \nactivism, Gonzales (2008) examined how the experience of exclusion shaped the political \nidentity and consciousness of undocumented students. He noted that the fear and shame \nof students’ undocumented status served as a catalyst for political engagement and for \nforging collective identity among undocumented youth. Sharing testimonies of exclusion \nplayed a critical role in the development of oppositional consciousness and critical \nthinking.  \nNegron-Gonzalez (2013) similarly explored the way in which negotiation of \n“illegality” in sites of daily life contributes to the development of an oppositional \nconsciousness. She found that engagement in activism, and the subsequent process of \ntaking pride in an undocumented identity, plays a role in eroding fear and shame. The \npervasive experience of being “othered” impelled undocumented youth to create \ncommunity and collective identity with other undocumented youth, often resulting in \npolitical engagement (Negron-Gonzalez, 2013). Morales et al. (2011) found similar \nresults, observing that undocumented immigrant students found common purpose, self-\npreservation, and resiliency in volatile political contexts through political advocacy. \nIn general, similar to research exploring the experiences of LGBTQ activists, the \nexisting literature on undocumented activists reveals that differences amongst \nparticipants regarding their experiences within the immigrant rights movement are rarely \nexplicitly explicated. Their experience is presumed homogeneous, and fewer are the \nstudies that highlight the intersection of multiple forms of oppression experienced by \nundocumented activists, specifically in regard to LGBTQ identities. No empirical study \nfocused on LGBTQ activists within the immigrant rights movement was accounted for,  \n  \n \t\r  23 \ndespite the fact that the leadership of the immigrant youth movement disproportionately \nidentifies as queer (Costanza-Chock, 2014). \nIntersecting Politics of LGBTQ Immigration in the U.S. \nHeteronormative immigration control has historically withheld recognition from \nmany kinds of immigrants, based not only on sexuality but also on intersecting gender, \nracial, class, and geopolitical factors (Foss, 1994; Luibhéid, 2008; Rodriguez, 2003). The \nideal of the “good citizen” has long been permeated with assumptions based on race, \nclass, gender and sexuality, and the notion of deportability has long been inscribed with \ndeep personal and social implications for those deemed socially undesirable to both make \nthem more exploitable by their bosses and easier to purge (De Genova, 2002; Kanstroom, \n2010; Ngai, 2004; Peutz & De Genova, 2010). Luibhéid (2002) identified the \nimmigration control apparatus as, “a key site for the production and reproduction of \nsexual categories, identities, and norms within relations of inequality” (p. x).  \nThe incorporation of sexual categorizations into exclusion laws, as well as the \ndevelopment of procedures to detect and deter entry by those who fit the \ncategorizations, is a key piece of how the immigration system came to exclude \nindividuals on the basis of sexuality. (Luibhéid, 1998, p. 479-480)  \n Beginning with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), homosexual \nexclusion was permitted by two provisions. The first was based on conduct, which treated \nhomosexuality as a behavior, a crime of “moral turpitude” that indicated a “lack of good \nmoral character.” The second provision barred immigrants based on status, which \nexcluded homosexuals as persons “afflicted with psychopathic personality” (as cited in \nCanaday, 2003; Minter, 1993). This categorization reflected the contemporary dominant \n \t\r  24 \nview that homosexuality was a mental illness.  Though the word homosexual was not \nused in the text of the statute, “those who were found to be homosexual or to engage in \nhomosexual behavior were almost always either denied entry or, if granted entry, later \ndeported for their status and/or conduct” (Chávez, 2007, p. 98). The dominant political \nand cultural ethos of the decade held that homosexuals, like communists, were \ndangerous, subversive, and profoundly un-American (as cited in Canaday, 2003; Minter, \n1993).  \nAfter the American Psychiatric Association (APA) removed homosexuality from \nits list of mental illnesses in 1973, and the Public Health Service announced that it would \nno longer certify homosexuals as psychopathic personalities, the Department of Justice in \n1980 announced that it would excise its legal obligation to exclude homosexuals from \nentering the U.S. only upon the voluntary admission by an immigrant that he or she was \nhomosexual (see Minter, 1993). Given the nature of this controversial provision—which \ndiscriminated against the openly homosexual immigrant and those who appear \nhomosexual even though they may not be (Pena, 2007)—the Immigration Act of 1990 \nrepealed many of the exclusionary provisions of the INA, thereby rescinding language \nbanning LGBTQ people from entering the country, and eliminating the pressure on \nimmigrants to conceal their sexual orientation within immigration processes and beyond.   \nGiven this history, pre-1990 political projects “publicly linking struggles around \nhomophobia, racism, and anti-immigrant sentiment” were practically impossible, as \nimmigrants who identified as LGBTQ “risked exclusion by announcing their presence, \npublicizing their struggles, or participating in organizing” (Luibhéid, 1998, p. 505). \nThough the lifting of the ban on LGBTQ people within immigration processes made new \n \t\r  25 \nsocial justice strategies possible, exclusions within immigration processes continue to \nmanifest themselves through rigid asylum policies; an HIV ban on immigration (lifted in \n2010); and the narrow definition of family, which continues to be used today (Luibhéid, \n2002).  \nToday, deeply rooted homo/heteronormativity within the LGBTQ and immigrant \nrights movements continues to place limitations on the scale and impact of intersectional \nwork. Marriage equality strategies within the LGBTQ rights movement, for example, are \nlimited by definitions of conventional citizenship (Chávez, 2010). Though the same-sex \nforeign-born partners of U.S. citizens are now eligible for sponsorship through family-\nbased immigration (see United States v. Windsor, 2013), their claim to family status \nremains contingent upon citizenship. Hence, though marriage equality has been \nrecognized as a constitutional right, LGBTQ undocumented immigrants who are single, \nunmarried or not in a relationship with a U.S. citizen are unable to benefit from this \nvictory (Queers for Economic Justice, 2007). Restrictive eligibility requirements and the \nlimited number of visas available per year, further, make undocumented immigrants who \nentered the U.S. without inspection ineligible to adjust their immigration status, even if \nmarried to a U.S. citizen (see Arellano, 2012; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996). \nWithin the immigrant rights movement, strategies that place undue emphasis on \nheteronormative family values, marriage and conceptions of normality are similarly not \ninclusive of LGBTQ immigrants’ experiences (Queers for Economic Justice, 2007). \nPositioning families and DREAMers as more deserving of a pathway to citizenship, for \nexample, simultaneously frames LGBTQ undocumented immigrants as “good” or “bad.” \n \t\r  26 \nGood immigrants if they fall within the dominant values of heteronormativity and gender \nconformance. Bad immigrants if they fall outside of these normative expressions of \nconservative nationalistic ideals. Hence, good immigrants become deserving of relief \nfrom deportation, renewable work permits, and temporary Social Security numbers, while \nbad immigrants become high priorities under the deportation machine. LGBTQ-neutral \nimmigration policies mask the complex ways that gender and sexuality affect \nundocumented immigrants’ eligibility for relief. \nSimilarly, because the definition of family in U.S. immigration law presumes a \nheteronormative family structure and is limited to parents, spouses, and children of \nimmigrants, it does not apply to more complex family structures (e.g., committed \nrelationships, extended families, kinship networks) responsive to the animus against \nLGBTQ people embodied by U.S. culture and law (e.g., family rejection, second-\nparent/stepparent adoption restrictions). Hence, without challenging the very definition of \nfamily and immigration law’s reliance on it, as well as policies that restrict the rights of \nLGBTQ people across states, the acquisition of legal status is thereby more likely to \nresult for those who already have some structural privileges (Chávez, 2010).  \nLGBTQ Undocumented Immigrants. LGBTQ undocumented immigrants face \nnumerous challenges endemic to the interaction of gender, sexuality and immigration \nstatus. Studies on the intersecting identities of gay immigrant men examine how gender, \nsexuality, social class and immigration interact in the identity formation processes of gay \nsubjectivities (Thing, 2010). Others explore the impact of international migration on the \ninterpretation and practice of gay sexuality (Carrillo & Fontdevila, 2014). Cantú (2009), \nfor example, investigates the role of sexuality in the processes of immigration and \n \t\r  27 \nidentity formation of Mexican gay male immigrants to the U.S. He finds that many gay \nMexican Latinos find themselves escaping homophobia in their home country, but \nencountering racism in the U.S. To negotiate stigma and ostracism from mainstream \ncommunities, they reconfigure familial and social networks.  \nSeveral studies highlight how migrant queers establish and sustain socio-cultural \nnetworks to mitigate the violence and rejection they face from biological families, \nmainstream society and the LGBTQ community (Acosta, 2008; Cantú, 1999, 2009; \nGopinath, 2005; Manalansan, 1994, 2003; Roque Ramirez, 2001). Gopinath (2005), for \nexample, found that queer migrants of color establish multiple hybrid cultures and create \nspaces for community activities and new cultural traditions in order to mitigate the \ndiscrimination and stigma they experience from both their own migrant communities and \nmainstream heterosexual and LGBTQ cultures. Acosta (2008) similarly describes how by \ndistancing themselves from their families of origin, migrant lesbianas construct a \nborderland space to express their sexuality. Their narratives illustrate their desire to \nmaintain close family ties while developing sexual identities outside of their familial \nstructures. Lesbianas sacrifice an out identity for the sake of maintaining family \nrelationships. \nPerforming a needs assessment of LGBTQ immigrants, asylees and refugees in \nSouthern Arizona, Chávez (2011) found that LGBTQ migrants expressed a desire for \ncultural competence regarding individuals’ cultural backgrounds, LGBTQ identity, \nimmigration status, and the ways these impact one another in all areas of service \nprovision (e.g., health care, legal, housing, education, employment). Surveillance and the \nability to obtain and keep housing without discrimination for migrant or LGBTQ status \n \t\r  28 \nwere significant issues for many LGBTQ migrants, as some constantly worried that they \nwould be harassed, arrested, or deported (Chávez, 2011).  \nGiven the prospect of detention for undocumented immigrants, several reports \nhave also documented incidents of sexual assault, denial of medical care, prolonged use \nof solitary confinement, verbal and physical abuse, and even death within immigration \ndetention centers (Biron, 2013; Burns, Garcia, & Wolgin, 2013; Dalton, 2013; Feder, \n2014; Gruber, 2013; Harmon, 2012; NIJC & PHR, 2012; Urbina, 2013). LGBTQ \nimmigrants have been particularly vulnerable to this abuse and mistreatment on account \nof their sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. Rape, harassment, abuse, and \ndenial of HIV treatment and hormone therapy are some of the routine forms of hardship \nfor LGBTQ immigrants in detention (Gruberg, 2013, 2014). Transgender detainees \nexperience perhaps the worst forms of mistreatment when they are misplaced in housing \nthat is discordant with their gender identity (Burns, Garcia & Wolgin. 2013). Instead of \nfinding refuge and safety from persecution, LGBTQ undocumented immigrants are \nthreatened with dangerous and life threatening conditions within a dysfunctional \nimmigration detention system. \nThough scarce, the literature on LGBTQ migrants/immigrants highlights several \nimportant intersections in their lived experiences. However, many of these accounts are \nof recent migrants. The focus is not on LGBTQ undocumented immigrants who have \ngrown up in the U.S. These accounts are not represented in the literature or are enmeshed \nwith the experiences of documented LGBTQ immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees. \nFurther, no studies currently reference activists’ perspectives or their experiences at the \noverlapping margins of LGBTQ and immigrant rights discourses. \n \t\r  29 \nSummary \nSince 1990, much has happened in the political landscape that has changed the \npublic discourse on LGBTQ and undocumented issues: the strike down of Texas’ anti-\nsodomy law (2003); the lifting of the 1987 HIV ban on immigration (2010); the repeal of \nDon’t Ask Don’t Tell (2011); DACA (2012), its expansion and DAPA (2014); the repeal \nof Section 3 of DOMA (2013); executive action for federal LGBTQ employment \nprotections (2014); and the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision for marriage equality (2015). \nDespite these changes, many challenges remain for LGBTQ undocumented immigrants: \nno pathway to citizenship, criminalization of LGBTQ and undocumented persons, \nmistreatment in detention centers, heteronormative immigration processes, and \nhomonormative political agendas.  \nThe scholarship on LGBTQ and undocumented activists conjoins related, yet \ndisparate bodies of literature that provide the context for this particular study. Although \nseparate bodies of scholarship can be found about LGBTQ and undocumented activists—\nas separate groups—few studies have examined the way LGBTQ undocumented \nimmigrants experience the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status, or the \nway they ascribe meaning to their experiences. Accounts of activists’ experiences as \nparticipants within the LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements are scarce, and the \nvoices of individuals at the overlapping margins of both movements remain absented. \nThough the stories of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants have been highlighted in the \nmedia, the lived experiences of undocuqueer activists have yet to be comprehensively \nexplored. \n  \n \t\r  30 \nConceptual Framework \nTo attend to this gap in the literature, I merge Queer Theory and Intersectionality \nto frame this study of undocuqueer activists’ lived experiences, and the importance of \nconsidering how individuals’ identities develop/become salient within the existing \nsociopolitical context of the U.S. \nQueer Theory \nQueer Theory is an anti-normative framework that seeks to subvert, challenge and \ncritique taken-for-granted stabilities in our social lives. It evolved as a response to \nidentity politics to propose a politics of difference, stressing the artificiality of boundaries \n(Baldo, 2008). According to Brekhus (2003), “contrary to the public perception of a \nunitary, easily identifiable, and coherent way to be gay (or to be any other identity), there \nare multiple ways to present and organize a marked identity,” and “there is considerable \nconflict within identity categories about how to perform one’s identity” (p. 11). Thus, \ndestabilizing and challenging naturalist assumptions is inherent to the very concept of \nQueer Theory (see Bernstein & Reimann, 2001; Boone & others, 2000). It is a lens \nthrough which to analyze how the constitution and enactment of sexual identities impacts \nhow power relations circulate and how identities may be sought and confirmed in light of \nthose relations. It is this politic of boundary disruption and category deconstruction that \nreminds us to attend to diversity among sexual minorities and to recognize the \ndiscontinuity of experience through time and across cultures. \nSexual identities are historical and social products that reflect the time, place, and \nculture in which they exist for the individuals who enact them (Butler, 2008; Foucault, \n1978; Sedgwick, 1990). Identity is constructed in and through its relations with others, \n \t\r  31 \nand with systems of power and knowledge. We embody the discourses that exist in our \nculture, and our being is constituted by them (Sullivan, 2003). Hence, queer subjects are \nthose that are consistently marginalized from normative and socially accepted identity \ncategories. For example, because immigration and LGBTQ status are sociopolitically and \nsocioculturally constructed, they are performative and repetitive, changing as the \nindividual affects society and as society affects the individual (Butler, 1993, 1999, 2008). \nHence, it is socially produced binaries that are the basis of oppression. Collective identity \nproduction is purchased at the price of hierarchy, normalization, and exclusion (Gamson, \n1995). \nQueer Theory advocates for change and conceives of ways bodies can serve as \nsites of ideological and discursive trouble (Burlington & Butler, 1999; Irving, 2008; \nMuñoz, 1999; Solis, 2007). It is through the loosening of definitions of identity that \nQueer Theory is able to challenge rigid social norms, and create broader social inclusion \nof people who do not neatly identify with normative standards (Fotopoulou, 2012; \nPrasad, 2009). It challenges the normative social ordering of identities and subjectivities \nalong the heterosexual/homosexual binary as well as the privileging of heterosexuality as \nnatural. \nQueer Theory is relevant to the purpose of this study because undocuqueer \nactivism is queer work. Coming out privileges individuals’ voices and non-normative \nperspectives, and effectively disrupts false conceptions of equality within the LGBTQ \nand immigrant rights movements. The very act of being out challenges the consistent \nerasure of undocuqueer experiences within LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. \nThe contradiction between their physical and social presence generates spaces of \n \t\r  32 \nnonexistence, an erasure of legal personhood, and a space of forced invisibility, \nexclusion, subjugation, and repression (De Genova, 2002). By coming out, undocuqueer \nimmigrants both “unreservedly and unapologetically assert their irreversible presence” \nand “uphold the intractable challenge of their own intrinsic incorrigibility” (De Genova, \n2010, p. 103).  \nUndocumented is not just a social relation to the state produced as an effect of law \nmaterially inscribed on papers, but also as an effect of a discursive formation—an \nidentity (De Genova, 2002). Publicly adopting undocumented as a label challenges and \nreshapes the grounds of exclusion by rejecting the fear, shame and invisibility inherent in \nan unauthorized immigration status (Corrunker, 2012; Galindo, 2012). It signifies that \nrepressive power is nothing compared to the power of vitality and indomitable will to \npersevere and prevail even without the protective blanket of legislations (De Genova, \n2010). Reclaiming undocumented, hence, challenges the notion of illegality and the \ncriminalization of undocumented immigrants, demonstrating that they will no longer \nallow the state or their antagonists to cast them to the shadows (Chávez, 1997; Corrunker, \n2012; Gonzalez & Chávez, 2012).  \nSimilarly, reclaiming queer asserts difference from heterosexuals and difference \namong gays themselves, resisting inclusion within existing heteronormative social \nstructures. By embracing the category used to shame and cast out sexual deviants, queer \nbecomes synonymous with a form of opposition (Warner, 1991). It insists upon more \ninclusivity because political membership is no longer defined by one’s (homo)sexuality \nor the sex/gender of one’s sexual partner, but rather by the shared dissent of the dominant \n(“normal”) organization of sex and gender (Duggan, 1992, p. 20). Because its roots lie \n \t\r  33 \ndeeply in activism, queer audaciously asserts the existence of something fundamentally \nunintelligible, incommensurable, incompatible, and inassimilable (De Genova, 2010). It \ndoes not seek integration within the existing social systems, rather a destabilization of \nnormative and hierarchical, rigidly constructed systems of power. Current structures are \nbuilt upon and reliant on the oppression of others (Foucault, 1978), pushing LGBTQ \npeople into the closet.  \nSo while undocumented reminds us of the diversity of differences within the \nLGBTQ community, queer forces attention to how sexuality and gender are as significant \nas other systems of power in immigration policies and practices. In line with Queer \nTheory, undocuqueer identities, hence, expose the privileging and normalizing tendencies \nof organizations and institutions casting LGBTQ undocumented immigrants to the \nshadows and into the closet. \nQueer Theory has previously been critiqued for ignoring the material \ncircumstances of various subject positions and relationships. In focusing on sexuality, for \nexample, Queer Theory elides the ways that the centrality of sexuality to an individual’s \nunderstanding of his/herself may be mediated by other factors that in some settings may \nbe more pressing or more salient—like the roles that race, class, gender and immigration \nstatus play in defining people’s differing relations to dominant and normalizing power \n(Carbado, 2005; Cohen, 2005). Organizing in a straight versus queer dichotomy \nsystematically ignores those who simultaneously experience exclusion along other axes \nof oppression (Johnson & Henderson, 2005). In response to this critique, the next section \ndescribes Intersectionality as a corrective to Queer Theory. I explore Intersectionality as \n \t\r  34 \nan analytic framework for understanding lived experience within interlocking structures \nof oppression and resistance. \nIntersectionality \nIntersectionality locates individual subjectivities and experiences within \nintersecting, hierarchical systems of domination and subordination (Collins, 2009b; \nCrenshaw, 1991), and is used as a way to make visible the experiences, identities, and \nsubject positions that unitary models of oppression obscure. It highlights some of what \ngets obfuscated, collapsed, or ignored in claims of solidarity by taking marginalized \nintersectional identities as an analytic starting point, revealing the complexity, \nsimultaneity and irreductability of lived experience within such groups (McCall, 2005).  \nIntersectionality begins with the theoretical assumption of anticategorical \ncomplexity, stating that unitary categories are too simplistic to capture the complexity of \nthe lived experience. It proclaims intracategorical complexity, problematizing the \nexclusionary repercussions of categorization in multiply-marginalized subjects’ \nexperiences, and highlights the relationships of inequality among already constituted \nsocial groups by asserting intercategorical complexity (McCall, 2005). It defines the \ninterlocking nature of identity and power, and reveals that there is no single identity \ncategory that satisfactorily describes how we respond to our social environment or are \nresponded to by others (Shields, 2008). Within this approach is the notion that \nsubjectivity is constituted by mutually reinforcing vectors of race, gender, class, and \nsexuality that compose “complex identities” (Meyers, 2000, p. 154). Because \nIntersectionality is attuned to subjects who exist within the overlapping margins of \nidentity discourse, it is used for exploring and theorizing the simultaneity of identity \n \t\r  35 \nconstructs as social processes, and the relationships between identity and intersecting \nsystems of inequality (Bowleg, 2008; Crenshaw, 1991). Because oppressions are \nexperienced simultaneously, and because they constitute one another, they are not \nreducible to unitary categories. To reduce them is to simplify subjects’ experiences.  \nIntersectionality is explicitly focused on locating individuals within “distinctive \nyet interlocking structures of oppression” linked together by macro level systems \n(Collins, 1993, p. 26). Collins’ (2009a) matrix of domination describes the overall \norganization of power in a society as organized through four interrelated domains. \n“Regardless of the particular intersections involved, structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, \nand interpersonal domains of power reappear across quite different forms of oppression” \n(p. 21). Collins (1991) moves beyond models of oppression rooted in the either/or \ndichotomous thinking, and expands the focus of analysis from merely describing the \nsimilarities and differences distinguishing systems of oppression to bringing greater \nattention to how they interconnect. It both notices and contends with the realities of \nmultiple inequalities (Crenshaw 1989). Put broadly, Intersectionality references the \nability of different systems of oppression to mutually construct one another and bring \nnew hybrid forms of oppression into being (Collins, 2003; Cooper, 2006). Through an \nintricate process of competing hierarchies, obligations, and experiences, these multiple \nlocations inform and modify one another in ways that produce qualitatively different \nlived realities (McCall, 2005). It is for this reason that different axes of oppression cannot \nsimply be added or multiplied together to produce one grand oppression.   \nRecognizing its complexity, scholars have previously used Intersectionality to \nunderscore the multidimensionality of Black women’s lived experiences by criticizing the \n \t\r  36 \nrigidly top-down social and political order from the perspective of the bottom up \n(Crenshaw 1991). Their experiences serve to demonstrate the shortcomings of \nconventional feminist and anti-racist work, which reproduce Black women’s \nsubordination in social hierarchies (Crenshaw, 1989, 1991). Crenshaw (1991) argues that \nby virtue of their membership in at least two subordinated groups that frequently pursue \nconflicting political agendas, Black women are inadequately represented in both. The \nproblem is that because gender oppression is constructed as the oppression suffered by \nWhite women, and race oppression as that suffered by Black men, these discourses \ncannot conceptualize the racialized, gendered oppression suffered by Black women \n(Crenshaw, 1991). The aim of critical accounts of Intersectionality like Creshaw’s is to \nconsider how race, class, gender and sexuality are intertwined and mutually constitutive.  \nDu Bois’ (1903/1996) double consciousness, Andersen and Collins’ (1992) \nsimultaneity, and Anzaldúa’s (1987) borderlands and mestizaje have all contributed to the \nstudy of Intersectionality as a lived experience and a method of inquiry that privileges \noppression. However, equally important to identifying interlocking systems of oppression \nwithin narratives of lived experience is challenging and deconstructing them. In this \nsense, Queer Theory aids the analysis of Intersectionality by taking account of the way \nparticipants utilize their non-normative identities as a form of resistance to normative \ndiscourses. In the following section, I propose Queer Intersectionality as a framework for \nexploring the lived experience of undocuqueer activists. \nQueer Intersectionality \nQueer Theory views identity as being multiple, exclusionary, fragmented, \nincoherent, disciplinary, disunified, unstable, fluid and perpetually becoming. It also \n \t\r  37 \nviews it as being constituted within historically, geographically and socially specific \nlocations. Because Intersectionality links together individual, interpersonal, and structural \ndomains of experience as inextricably related (Dill & Zambrana, 2009; Shields, 2008), it \nstrategically supplements Queer Theory’s critical account of non-normativity as \nresistance. Intersectionality is a corrective to a Queer Theory that omits the significance \nof intersectional systems of power on queer sexuality and gender—multiple identity \ndimensions are always fused intrasectionally. It is a theory developed from people’s lived \nexperiences that places the struggles of marginalized communities at the center of \nanalysis, and examines the ways interconnected domains of power organize and structure \ninequality and oppression. Together, Queer Theory and Intersectionality recognize the \ncomplexity and fluidity of experience and the systems of power that produce it. They \nchallenge normalized conceptions of identity, while simultaneously deconstructing \nsimplistic ideas about subjectivity and political action based on the lived experiences and \nsubjectivities of oppressed people.  \nWard (2008) previously used Intersectionality to re-theorize the political practice \nand performance of what Duggan (2003) calls the new homonormativity of the LGBTQ \nrights movement. She proposed Queer Intersectionality as an approach striving for racial, \ngender, socioeconomic, and sexual diversity, while simultaneously resisting the \ninstitutional forces seeking to contain and normalize differences and reinforce static \nidentity categories. Ethnographically, Ward (2008) shows how race, class, gender and \nsexuality structure both identities and social movements, and suggests that an \nexamination of sexuality is integral to an Intersectionality approach. \n \t\r  38 \nRahman (2010) similarly theorized Intersectionality using Queer Theory for \nresearch on gay Muslim identities.  Rahman suggested an understanding of \nIntersectionality as productively queer, and queer as analytically intersectional; thus, \nilluminating gay Muslims’ identities as always ontologicaly deferred from the dominant \nidentity categories of gay and Muslim, resultant from cultural and political Islamophobia \nand homophobia. Rahman argued that an explicitly queer intersectional perspective gives \nus a purchase on the lived experiences of multiple oppressions that allows us to better \narticulate their significance. The ontological uncertainty of individuals’ lived experience \n“inevitably directs us to consider that dominant identity categories are, in actuality, \nontologically incomplete and achieve their (incomplete) coherence only through the \nexclusion of ‘others’” (Rahman, 2010, p. 953). \nThis dissertation heeds to Ward (2008) and Rahman’s (2010) call for more \ngrounded standpoint research from a queer intersectional approach. It seeks to consider \nhow Intersectionality and Queer Theory can come together along matrices of domination \n(Collins, 2000) to explore the lived experiences of undocuqueer activists at the \noverlapping margins of two single variable identity-based social movements. While \nabjectivity (see Kristeva, 1982; McNevin, 2009; Nyers, 2003) and mestiza consciousness \n(see Anzaldúa, 1987) frameworks have previously been used to study LGBTQ and \nimmigrant populations, Queer Intersectionality is used to (1) place the experiences of \nundocuqueer activists at the center of analysis; (2) explore the complexities of individual \nand collective identity, recognizing that variations within groups are often ignored and \nessentialized; (3) reveal the ways interconnected domains of power organize and produce \n \t\r  39 \ninequality and oppression; and (4) analyze the ways undocuqueer activists resist the \nnormalizing tendencies of organizations and institutions. \n \n  \n \t\r  40 \nCHAPTER 3: Methodology \nThough political conditions constrain particular events from being narrated, \nactivism in the form of storytelling helps individuals name their injuries, connect with \nothers, and engage in political action (Riessman, 1993; Solinger et al., 2008). Polletta \n(2006, 2009) contends that storytelling is an effective way for social movements to \ncounter hegemonic meanings, as stories highlight issues of social justice, promote human \nrights, and propel people and communities to activism. Stories about injustice can \novercome some of the limitations of policy frames by breaking coercive silences and the \nisolation of their narrators. Stories inspire sympathy, solidarity and identification by \nmaking the abstract real and the political personal (Zimmerman, 2012).  \nThe power behind stories is that they also help us to understand ourselves in \nrelation to others. They are fundamentally about the vicissitudes of human intention \norganized in time (Bruner, 1986, 1990). According to Polkinghorne (1995), “stories \nexpress a kind of knowledge that uniquely describes human experience in which actions \nand happenings contribute positively and negatively to attaining goals and fulfilling \npurposes” (p. 8). The ability to reflect and make meaning of past experiences serves as a \ncore psychological process in connecting memories to identities, and is considered a \ndriving force for identity development (McLean, 2005; McLean, Pasupathi, & Pals, 2007; \nThorne & McLean, 2003; Thorne, 2000). Because storylines arise out of, are associated \nwith, and locate narratives within specific cultural and social environments, storytelling \nreveals facets of a narrator’s situated selfhood—how individuals make sense of \nthemselves and their place in the world (Ochs & Capps, 1996). The way context  \n  \n \t\r  41 \ninfluences individuals’ perceptions of identity is directly related to the complexity of the \nindividuals’ meaning-making capacity (Abes & Jones, 2004; Abes, Jones, & McEwen, \n2007). \nBecause storytelling “privileges positionality and subjectivity” (Reissman, 2000, \np. 696), and because stories have played a significant role in advocacy and human rights \nstruggles (see Beverley, 2004; Dawes, 2007; Nance, 2006; Schaffer & Smith, 2004)— \nparticularly within the LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements (Corrunker, 2012; \nVivienne & Burgess, 2012; Zimmerman, 2012)—narrative inquiry is used as the primary \nmethod for exploring the lived experiences and personal meaning-making of \nundocuqueer activists. Narrative inquiry recognizes that personal stories are shaped by \nthe knowledge, experiences, values and feelings of the persons who are telling them. It \nadvances a social justice research agenda in line with the tenets of Intersectionality and \nQueer Theory, placing lived experience at the starting point of theory development and \nallowing for the reframing and redefining of ontological views that, within normative \ncategorizations, have been rendered as marginalized, silenced and oppressed.   \nBecause LGBTQ and undocumented activists have been sharing their stories \nseparately within their respective movements to counter dominant homo/transphobic and \nanti-immigrant narratives, narrative inquiry is a suitable approach to the study of \nundocuqueer activists. In the following section, I discuss how this research uses their \nstories as undocuqueer activists are used to explore their lived experience at the \noverlapping margins of gender, sexuality and immigration status, as well as understand \nthe way they navigate and attach meaning to their experiences. This discussion is \nproceeded by a description of the study context and the individuals invited to participate. \n \t\r  42 \nI conclude by describing the methods for data collection and my analysis, paying special \nattention to my positionality as a queer immigrant of color. \nNarrative Inquiry \nNarratives are accounts of lived experience organized as stories selected, \norganized, and evaluated as meaningful for a particular audience (Hinchman & \nHinchman, 1997; Riessman, 2004; Schegloff, 1997). They represent the explanatory and \ndialogic recapitulations of past events co-constructed, co-evaluated, and modified \nthrough interaction and negotiation between teller and audience (De Fina, 2009). Unlike \nstories, narratives are in a constant state of production and re-production, and can escape \nthe neat organization of monological tellings. \nNarratives are a way of understanding one’s own and others’ actions, organizing \nevents and objects into a meaningful whole, and connecting and seeing the consequences \nof actions and events over time (Chase, 2005). Narratives provide access to the meaning-\nmaking process as it actively occurs, and allow participants to “find and speak in their \nown ‘voices’” (Mishler, 1986, p. 118). Atkinson (2007) explains that the experience of \nnarrating a life story is associated with benefits such as meaning-making, greater self-\nunderstanding, and disclosure that promotes healing and increased understanding of \nsocial and community phenomena. Thus, narratives provide the structure by which one \norganizes their view of self through time, and interprets the past in the light of the current \nprocess of narrativizing self (Georgakopoulou, 2007). Narrative statements are, thus, \nopportunities for individuals to (re)create and (re)present who they are. For this reason, \nthe narrative structures and the vocabulary we use when we craft and tell stories of our \n \t\r  43 \nperceptions and experiences are significant for understanding the impact of external \ninfluences on lived experience (Sikes & Gale, 2006).  \nLangellier (1999) states that personal narratives constitute identities and are sites \n“where the social is articulated, structured, and struggled over” (p. 128). Personal \nnarratives evolve from a structure of power relations, and simultaneously produce, \nmaintain, and reproduce that power structure (Langellier, 1989). Identities, at the \npersonal level, can be analyzed as narratives that are products of lived subjective \nexperience, which are made meaningful in relation to identities at the cultural and social \nlevel (Khayatt, 2002). This multi-level view of identity allows critical researchers to \nconnect lived experience to larger political, social, and cultural contexts. For this reason, \nnarratives become a fundamental analytic tool for the study of immigrant and LGBTQ \nlives, as both LGBTQ and undocumented issues are at the center of major policy and \ncivil rights discussions today. \nTo account for this multi-level view of identity, I adopt a constructivist \nperspective to explore societal dynamics and power structures. Not accounting for \nnativism and heterosexism within a study of identity construction reifies the structures of \noppression (Abes, 2009, 2012). Narratives are always historically situated and dependent \non the cumulative social and political activity that transforms societal attitudes around a \ngiven topic (Cohler & Hammack, 2006; Hammack, 2008). As Clandinin and Rosiek \n(2007) explain, \nBeginning with a respect for ordinary lived experience, the focus of narrative \ninquiry is not only a valorizing of individual’s experience but also an exploration \nof social, cultural and institutional narratives within which individual’s \n \t\r  44 \nexperiences were constituted, shaped, expressed and enacted. (p.42) \nIn qualitative research, the methods we use often let us speak to or interact with people \ndirectly. Hence, partnering Queer Intersectionality with my constructivist perspective \nbecomes an important borderland (Abes 2009, 2012; Anzaldúa, 1987) for exploring the \nconstruction and deconstruction of lived experience. Constructivism is not concerned \nwith generalizations. Instead it focuses on how individuals make meaning on a micro-\nlevel (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Constructivism assumes reality, knowledge, truth, and \nmeaning are constructed by individuals, and that this construction of meaning is linked \nbetween the researcher and participant (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). \nPreviously, narratives have been used to explore the construction of sexual \nidentity within the context of socio-historically located discourse and meanings of \nhomosexuality (see Cohler & Hammack, 2006, 2007; Dilley, 2002, 2005; Hammack, \n2005; Hammack & Cohler, 2009; Parks, 1999). Narratives of same-sex attraction and \nidentity have similarly been used to illustrate how socio-cultural context is central to \nunderstanding accounts of identity construction (see Abes & Jones, 2004; Flowers & \nBuston, 2001; Luizzi, 2001; Stevens, 2004; Trujillo, 1991). Findings overwhelmingly \nsuggest that one’s sexual identity is complexly integrated and often at odds with other \naspects of an individual’s identity.  \nNarratives have also previously been used to make hearable the voices of \nimmigrants and to insert their experiences into the landscape of political debate (see \nCaminero-Santangelo, 2012; Gonzalez, Plata, Garcia, Torres, & Urrieta, 2003; King & \nPunti, 2012; Orner & Andes, 2008). Narratives have described how being undocumented \ninfluences immigrant youths’ educational aspirations, experiences, and opportunities \n \t\r  45 \n(Gonzalez, 2008; Gonzalez & Chávez, 2012; Torres & Wicks-Asbun, 2013), while \ncounternarratives have acknowledged and created spaces for exposing and resisting \nhegemonic narratives of illegality (Castro-Salazara & Bagley, 2010; Muñoz & \nMaldonado, 2012). Findings overwhelmingly reflect the ways in which abjectivity and \nimmigration status constrain individuals’ daily lives, create internalized fears, in some \nways immobilize families, and in other ways motivate them to engage politically to resist \nthe dire conditions of their lives. \nNo narrative study to date, however, has explored the experiences of undocuqueer \nactivists, specifically. The experiences of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants continue to \nbe negotiated and commoditized to reinforce and (re)produce a false homogeneity within \nthe LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. A study of the lived experiences of \nundocuqueer activists brings light to the diversity and inconsistencies within monolithic \nconstructions of identity, and advance a politic that is not just good for one group, but one \nthat sees how race, class, gender, sexuality and other systems of power operate together \nto sustain structural and systemic oppression.  \nStudy Context \n Because undocuqueer activists are part of two sensitive and relatively invisible \npopulations, I collected data from self-identified undocuqueer activists who were also \nmembers of LGBTQ immigrant organizations in the U.S.  The Queer Undocumented \nImmigrant Project (QUIP), a project of United We Dream, has been one of the principal \norganizations addressing and advocating for LGBTQ undocumented immigrants. QUIP \nseeks to empower LGBTQ undocumented immigrants, queer immigrant youth and allies \nthrough grassroots organizing, leadership development, education and advocacy (United \n \t\r  46 \nWe Dream, 2015). The project aims to build bridges between the LGBTQ and immigrant \ncommunities by creating awareness of individuals’ lived experiences at the intersection \nof two politically marginalized social movements. It strives for solidarity within the \nLGBTQ and immigrant communities, and exemplifies coalitional politics congruent with \nthe alternative and liberatory strategies of Queer Theory. \n While only Washington D.C. and Arizona hold official QUIP chapters, numerous \naffiliate organizations within the UWD network have identified undocuqueer leaders that \nactively promote QUIP tactics and strategies within their local communities. I worked \ndirectly with QUIP leadership to recruit these activists. Given the changing nature of \npolicy and legislation, it is important to note that interviews were conducted within the \nsociopolitical context of October and November 2014.  \nParticipant Selection \nLGBTQ undocumented immigrants represent a relatively small, geographically \ndispersed segment of the general population. The UCLA Williams Institute reports that \nthere are an estimated 267,000 LGBTQ-identified undocumented immigrants living the \nU.S. (Gates, 2013). They are younger than the broader undocumented population—nearly \nhalf (49%) are under the age 30, as compared to 30 percent of the total undocumented \npopulation that falls in this same age range—and a substantial majority identifies as \nHispanic (71%)3. Similarly, compared to the broader LGBTQ community where the \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n3 Followed by Asian and Pacific Islanders (15%), Whites (8%), and Blacks (6%) \n \t\r  47 \nmajority is female (53%), men comprise the majority of LGBTQ-identified \nundocumented immigrants (67%) (Gates, 2013).4  \nAs a member of the Arizona chapter of QUIP, I started with a convenience \nsample of Arizona QUIP members. Given its effectiveness for sampling hard-to-reach, or \nequivalently hidden populations (Heckathon, 2011), snowball sampling aided the process \nof identifying additional eligible participants. I recruited 10 Arizona QUIP members to \nparticipate, and solicited their assistance in identifying a total of 21 other undocuqueer \nactivists who, like them, (1) self-identified as undocuqueer, (2) were over the age of 18, \nand (3) were involved in some form of undocuqueer activism. Upon receiving their \nreferral, I contacted them via Facebook and requested their participation. Two individuals \nwho had recently resolved their immigration status, but still self-identified as \nundocuqueer, were included in the total sample of 31 participants (see Table 1.). \nParticipants currently resided 10 different U.S. states, plus Washington D.C, and \nrepresented six different countries of origin. All 31 participants identified as \nHispanic/Latino, and the majority of participants (30) were between the ages of 19-30. \nCisgender men (17) composed the majority of the sample, followed by genderqueer (6) \nparticipants, cisgender women (4), and transgender women (4). Twenty-one participants \nwere DACA recipients, and 22 had at least some college experience (see Table 1.).  \n\t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n4 These figures represent the lower-bound estimates of the true undocumented LGBTQ population in the \nU.S., as they do not account for undocumented LGBTQ immigrants under the age of 18 or under-reporting \nresultant from reluctance in self-identifying as undocumented or LGBTQ.\t\r  \n \t\r  48 \n \nData Collection \nSemi-structured Interviews.

Consistent with \nmy constructivist epistemology, the data for this qualitative study was generated from in-\ndepth, conversational, semi-structured interviews with undocuqueer activists. I situated \nthe findings in a cultural context based on participants’ constructions of meaning. \nAll interviews were conducted in person or via Skype videoconference. The \ninterviews were designed to generate narratives that served as the sole method of inquiry. \nThey aimed to elicit descriptions of and/or narratives about (1) their lives; (2) their \nexperiences; (3) and the meaning they ascribed to being undocuqueer. Though I relied on \na uniform interview protocol, participants retained the discretion to lead the direction of \nthe interview and choose how to relay their narratives. Interviews ranged between 45 \nminutes to 3.5 hours. Prior to the interview, I reviewed the purpose of the study and \nprovided each respondent with an informed-consent agreement form. All interviews were \nrecorded, and each interview produced two separate sources of data: audio recording and \nresearcher’s notes.  \n Protocol. Riessman (2008) emphasizes that the goal of narrative interviewing is \nto generate detailed accounts rather than general or closed-ended responses. Hence, open-\nended interview questions were used to elicit narration and allow the narrator to lead the \nprocess (see Appendix A for full data collection protocol). I carried out the interviews as \nthey occurred organically, making judgments about additional questions to ask and areas \nto explore as they arose. Specifically, I explored and probed into language that signified \n  \n \t\r  50 \npatterns of thinking and behaviors pertaining to meaning making. I used the following \nopen-ended probes to delve further into participants’ responses:  \n• Tell me more about that. \n• How did that make you feel? \n• What did that mean to you? \n• What was that experience like for you? \n• What happened next? \nI commenced each interview broadly asking participants to share their story with \nme. To explore the ways in which they navigated the intersection of their LGBTQ and \nundocumented experience, I probed into those specific instances where their LGBTQ and \nundocumented identities came up. To capture the nuances of their lived experience, I \nasked them to share their coming out experiences as LGBTQ, undocumented, and \nundocuqueer.  \nFollowing these stories, I asked participants what being undocuqueer meant to \nthem, and how they perceived that being undocumented affected their experience as \nLGBTQ, and vice versa. This set of questions aimed at eliciting the meaning participants \nascribed to their undocuqueer identity, and the ways they understood how dimensions of \ntheir identity impacted each other. \nUpon gauging participants’ self-meanings and perceptions of self, I moved the \nconversation toward exploring their experiences at the overlapping margins of the \nLGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. The following set of questions sought to elicit \nactivists’ motivations and/or triggers leading to their involvement in undocuqueer \nactivism. More specifically, I asked how, when and why they decided to get involved \n \t\r  51 \nwith undocuqueer activism, and how their experiences, as undocumented and LGBTQ, \ninfluenced their involvement in undocuqueer activism. In order to gauge immediate needs \nand participants’ perceptions of the LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements, I ended \nthe interview by asking participants what they would like to see happen within the \nLGBTQ and immigrant rights movements, respectively.  \nThis interview process provided moments for transformation and empowerment, \nas participants were able to share their coping and survival strategies as they worked to \naffirm their gender, sexuality and immigration status. \nResearcher \nConstructivism encourages interpretive inquiry, whereby meaning making is \nshaped by the perspectives and perceptions of the researcher (Piantanida & Garman, \n2009). As the researcher, I hold the view that meaning and knowledge are human \nconstructions. My thoughts are rooted in notions that multiple realities exist, and that \nrealities are co-constructed between the researcher and participant through dialogue \n(Charmaz, 2006, 2008a, 2008b; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). In this sense, narrative inquiry is \na collaborative venture between researcher and participant. As the researcher, I serve as a \nparticipatory interactant subjectively and intersubjectively, through my own lens and \nthrough interaction with participants, interpreting meaning based on participants’ \nperceptions and experiences (Grbich, 2012). Because narrative accounts are context \nsensitive and dependent on the type of relationships that interviewers and interviewees \nestablish (De Fina, 2009, 2011), I describe my subjectivity as a queer immigrant of color \nand my involvement with LGBTQ and immigrant rights organizations. I utilized this \nsubjectivity to better engage all aspects of the research process (e.g., planning, data \n \t\r  52 \ncollection, and data analysis). \nAs direct beneficiaries of family-based immigration, my family permanently \nmigrated to the U.S. from Mexico when I was six years old. Though we were all born in \nMexico, my mother was fortunate enough to become naturalized after my grandfather \npetitioned for her through family based immigration. She then was able to utilize this \nopportunity to petition for my dad and me. Prior to receiving our green cards, however, it \nwas not uncommon for our family to utilize relatives’ documentation to cross the \nU.S./Mexico border. In many ways, that was the only option we had to visit friends and \nfamily in the U.S., given our inability to otherwise qualify for a tourist visa. \nMoving to the U.S., I quickly learned there was an inherent class-based stigma \nassociated with being an immigrant. Much of it had to do with skin color and language \nproficiency, but as a child, I internalized it as citizenship. In many ways, it was easier for \nme to claim to be a U.S. citizen than to confront the reality of being treated as a \n“problem.” Though I became naturalized at the age of 16, I did not incur pride in my \nimmigrant experience until I started college. College inculcated a sense of pride in \ndiversity that impelled me to reflect on my immigrant background and embrace it. \nThis self-exploration ultimately induced me to come to terms with my sexuality. I \nrecognized my attraction to other men as early as 12, but shoved it to the back of my \nmind because I was afraid of social consequences. The visibility of other LGBTQ \nstudents and groups on campus, however, gave me the courage to challenge internalized \nhomophobia and ensue my identity crisis. The biggest impediment to my sexual identity \ndevelopment was the overwhelming heteropatriarchal oppression I felt at home, which \nplaced restrictions as to who and what I could be and how I could show it. Hence, going \n \t\r  53 \naway to college represented an opportunity to engage identity exploration outside the \nrestrictive constraints of home. Though I was out to friends and significant others on \ncampus, I was not open with my family. I avoided or deflected all sorts of personal \nquestions and lied, when necessary, to keep my personal and family lives separate. When \nI finally built up the courage to come out to my family at the age of 23, I did not \nexperience rejection, as I originally feared. Rather, I experienced guilt for bringing shame \nand disappointment to my family. Six years later, though my family is supportive, my \nparents still struggle to reconcile their feelings about having an openly gay son. Hence, \nfamily support comes at the cost self-regulation. \nToday, I define myself as an educator, an organizer and an educational activist \nresearcher. I educate to increase others’ competencies for working with diverse \npopulations, and organize to challenge exclusionary systems of oppression underlying \neducation policy. I have been a member of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition (ADAC) \nand QUIP since 2012, actively participating in meetings, marches, fundraisers and \nactions.  My involvement came about in collaboration with DREAMzone, a knowledge \nmobilization initiative I coordinate at Arizona State University that seeks to create safe \nand inclusive spaces for undocumented students within educational institutions. My \ncommitment to the work was triggered by my personal experience as an immigrant, and \nmy coming out struggles as a queer person of color.  \nEthical Considerations \nMy involvement within the LGBTQ, immigrant and undocuqueer communities \nhelps procure cultural competency and ethical care, and assists in gaining participants’ \ntrust for sharing their experiences. My positionality, further, enables me to directly  \n \t\r  54 \n  \n \t\r  55 \ninteract and connect with participants in ways that are less exploitative, less objectifying, \nand more politically relevant (Haritaworn, 2008).  \nAs an activist myself, I intend to use the results of this study to not only increase \nawareness of the work and experiences of undocuqueer activists, but also to synthesize \ncultural knowledge for the LGBTQ and immigrant communities. Activist research in \neducation is counter-hegemonic in purpose and in action, and is committed to bringing \nabout material change for participants and others in the community at the spaces and sites \nof research (DeMeulenaere & Cann, 2013). Because activist research reflects the degree \nto which individual lives are affected by the research, my hope is to produce reports that \ncan assist undocuqueer activists advocate for resources, support and funding conducive to \ntheir movement-building agendas. \nProtecting the confidentiality of participants is a vital component of this study. I \nprovide confidentiality through the use of pseudonyms. Prior to the interview, I reviewed \nthe purpose of the study and communicated that all interviews would be recorded and \nsubsequently transcribed. A letter of consent was provided to all participants at the site of \nthe interview, and consent was obtained through their participation (see Appendix B). \nAnalytic Procedure \nNarrative analysis is an inductive process that starts out with the assertion that \nhuman experience has a crucial narrative dimension (Kleres, 2011). It seeks to access the \ninner world of perception and meaning making through narratives in order to understand, \ndescribe, and explain social processes from the perspective of study participants. Hence, \nthe unit of analysis for my study was personal narratives. As the researcher, I interpreted \nthe content constructed within the text of the narrative in an attempt to give meaning to \n \t\r  56 \nwhat was being expressed by the narrator (Riessman, 2004; Saldana, 2013). The analysis \nlooked beyond what was told in order to understand the underlying intention and purpose \nthe content served. Personal stories in individuals’ storytelling generated not only the \npotential for recurring motifs, but also connected meanings and thought processes \n(McLeod & Thompson, 2009). The ultimate goal was to create a story as research \nrepresentation that depicted “how and why a particular outcome came about” \n(Polkinghorne, 1995, p. 19).   \nI started by producing verbatim texts of participants’ narrative interviews. I \nutilized Dragon speech recognition software to assist me with transcribing interviews \nconducted in English, but transcribed Spanish and Spanglish interviews solely by hand. \nFollowing transcription, I imported all interviews into MAXQDA, a qualitative data \nanalysis software. I ensued open coding, noting concepts that emerged directly from \nwords or phrases of the interviewees, or indirectly from my interpretation of segments of \nthe transcripts. I utilized the MAXQDA color coding functions to differentiate codes, and \ngrounded the language that I employed for naming my codes in the terminology and \nconstructs of Queer Intersectionality (e.g., patterns of resistance, intersections, and \nnormalizing discourses). I used the following questions to guide the process: \n1. What is this segment of the story about? \n2. What can I understand about the narrator’s experience from this narration? \nThese questions helped me focus on the content of the narratives and the meanings \ncirculating from them. Open coding resulted in the following broad categories: Meaning \nmaking, Intersections, Queering, Identity Negotiation, Survival, DREAMer Discourse, \nand Limitations (see Table 2.).  \n \t\r  57 \n During second level coding, I looked at each of the aforementioned categories \nindividually, and created sub-categories illustrative of participants’ contextualized \nexperiences. These sub-categories helped describe the context of the broader categories \nand illustrated the diversity within participants’ experiences within each category. While \nmany sub-categories emerged, only those with a minimum of five codes were retained for \nanalysis in this study. Their frequencies are outlined in Table 3. \n  \n \t\r  58 \n  \n \nTable 2.

To increase the study’s trustworthiness, I employed peer-\ndebriefing strategies. Peer debriefers challenged my interpretations of data, identified \ngaps in my analyses, and constructively responded to my preliminary interpretations of \nthe data. Peer debriefers consisted of five individuals who were provided my codebook \nand preliminary interpretations of my analysis. They were also invited on several \noccasions to interpret the de-identified data with me. Three of my peer debriefers were \nalso participants in this study, so they simultaneously held me accountable to staying true \nto their narratives and their movement.  \nProlonged engagement between the investigator and the participants further \nsupports the trustworthiness of this study. As previously stated, I have been a member of \nthe Arizona Queer Undocumented Immigrant Project since 2012, actively participating in \nretreats, events and actions. This involvement has allowed me to reflect on, learn about \nand understand the culture, social setting, and experiences of undocuqueers within the \ncontext of activism. Through my involvement, I have been able to gain an adequate \nunderstanding of undocuqueer activism and establish a relationship of trust with \nparticipants as a peer, an ally and a colleague. Since then, I have also become a member \nof Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement, an LGBTQ Latino grassroots \norganization.    \n \t\r  60 \nCHAPTER 4: Findings \nIn this chapter, I present the findings from 31 individual interviews conducted \nwith 31 self-identified undocuqueer activists. This chapter is organized around two \nresearch questions.  \n1. How do undocuqueer activists make sense of the intersection of their LGBTQ and \nundocumented experience?  \n2. How do undocuqueer activists interact and work within the intersection of their \nLGBTQ and undocumented experience? \nMy first question gets more at theorizing personal experience in accordance with \nparticipants’ meaning making, where as my second question addresses the more practical \nlived experiences. Because question two follows and informs question one, I have \norganized Section 1 of this chapter around the meanings participants ascribed to living at \nthe intersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience. Three overarching self-\nmeanings emerged from the data: Vulnerability, Complexity and Resilience. These self-\nmeanings describe the ways participants perceived the interplay of their gender, sexuality \nand immigration status within the current sociopolitical context encompassing the state of \ntheir (non)existence. Recognizing their vulnerability within a state of illegibility \n(Anzaldúa, 1987), participants described a sense of exclusion within spaces of belonging, \nand wariness managing relationships with others. Opting for more complex self-\ndefinitions, they resisted simplistic conceptions of identity that rendered their social \nlocations invisible (e.g., homonormativity, heteronormativity, DREAMer). Surviving \nsocietal as well as familial rejection, they demonstrated resilience even when thriving \nseemed (im)possible to do so. \n \t\r  61 \nSection 2 specifically addresses the consistent theme of identity negotiation, \nwhich participants described as essential for interacting and working within the \nintersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience. This section describes how \nparticipants utilized coming out as a form of resistance to institutionalized oppression, \nand resilience amidst anti-immigrant, xenophobic and heterosexist power structures. It \nconcludes highlighting how participants simultaneously work to bridge their communities \nthrough their stories, activism and peer education. \nSection 1: Meaning Making \nI started each interview asking participants to share their story with me. More \nspecifically, I inquired about their coming out experiences as LGBTQ, undocumented \nand undocuqueer. Next, I asked them to describe what it means to be undocuqueer—to \nlive at the intersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience. In their narratives, \nparticipants inevitably highlighted the salience of their gender identity and expression as \nrelated to their LGBTQ identity. Beyond just conversations around sexuality and \nimmigration status, gender was deemed significant, particularly for trans identities. \nThree overarching self-meanings emerged from the data: Vulnerability, \nComplexity and Resilience. These self-meanings were informed by participants’ \nexperiences navigating the sociopolitical context of their state around LGBTQ and \nimmigration issues. Living in the borderlands between cultures rendered participants \npartially unintelligible to dominant LGBTQ and immigrant culture simultaneously. \nHence, experiences generally centered around the illegibility (Anzaldúa, 1987) \nparticipants experienced resultant from hostility against LGBTQ and undocumented \npeople inscribed into law.  \n \t\r  62 \nVulnerability: Recognizing Illegibility Inscribed by Law \n Participants described recognizing their existence as a vulnerable existence. The \nintersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status for several participants invoked a \ncertain level of fear and uncertainty imposed by law, policy and dominant culture. \nParticipants shared the looming threat of rejection and deportation as two factors that \nconsistently shaped the way they navigated their lives. Consequently, they described \nundocuqueer as being vulnerable to dominant culture and the state. The ways they were \nlooked at, or not, contributed to the illegibility they experienced, given the contradiction \nbetween their physical and social presence inscribed by law. Their marginalization was \nmost evidenced at the state level, where they were prevented from accessing specific state \npublic benefits (e.g., identification card, driver’s license, financial aid, and health care) \nand rights (e.g., marriage and employment non-discrimination) otherwise afforded to \ndocumented heterosexuals. However, their vulnerability similarly extended to the ways \nthese limitations materialized as exclusion and rejection within dominant culture. \nJulio, a 20-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, described how his sexuality \nand immigration status imposed simultaneous barriers to his everyday existence and \nmade him vulnerable to the state. Restrictive laws and policies targeted his queer and \nundocumented identities simultaneously via racial profiling practices, exclusions and \nreligious exemptions (e.g., SB 1070, Prop 300 and SB 1062). \nProp 300, not being able to go to school, in-state tuition, not qualifying for that. \nThen SB 1062, like those type of things that, you know, different propositions \nthat, one that doesn't allow me to go to state universities and the other one that I \nwould get discriminated if going into a business type of place.  Those kind of \n \t\r  63 \nthings affect me because of my two different identities, one being undocumented \nthe second one being queer. And then also with my family, the queer part, them \nnot understanding me and accepting me for who I am. \nFor Julio, these laws targeted his queer and undocumented identities simultaneously, and \nrendered him vulnerable as an LGBTQ undocumented immigrant. Arizona Proposition \n300, for example, provides that university students who are not U.S. citizens or \npermanent residents, or who do not have lawful immigration status, are not eligible for \nin-state tuition status or financial aid that is funded or subsidized by state monies. \nArizona SB 1062, which was largely reported as targeting LGBTQ people, was a bill \ngiving any individual or legal entity an exemption from any state law if it substantially \nburdened their exercise of religion. Experiencing social rejection inscribed by the threat \nof these policies, Julio described feeling displaced. Restrictive policy perpetuated the \nstigmatization of LGBTQ and immigrant communities, and placed restrictions on his \nability to navigate the contradiction between his physical and social presence resultant \nfrom having an undocumented status; for example, accessing LGBTQ-friendly health \nresources. \nWhen it comes to me, it’s like, receiving medical care or information about \nhealth-related issues or getting those types of services, those are things that I can’t \nbecause sometimes they ask for Social Security or they ask for residency or \ncitizenship, things that I don't have. Or an ID, they ask for these things that I don't \nhave. So, you know, these resources that are out there for LGBT people, \nsometimes I can't get a hold of them because I am who I am. I am undocumented.  \n \t\r  64 \nThe absence of social support services for undocumented immigrants made navigating \nfacets of Julio’s LGBTQ identity difficult.  \nFranco, a 24-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, similarly described this \ndilemma.  \nBeing undocumented among the LGBTQ community, I feel like I am just this \nlittle magnet walking around just waiting for anything to fall on me, like any \nsickness or anything. And that's scary. Being undocumented and not easily being \nable to turn out to a program, it is hard. And aside from the health care system, \nhousing and shelters. There is none. There is none here within our state…There is \nno flexibility, there is no programs that really cater to the undocumented queer \ncommunity. I think it's because of propositions in place, like legislation placed in \nthe state of Arizona, which is Proposition 200. It really limits the reach for the \nundocumented community.  \nGiven the material limitations of being undocumented, as facilitated by anti-immigrant \nstate policies, Franco described feeling unrecognized and unprotected—particularly \nbecause his immigration status similarly prevented him from accessing LGBTQ-specific \npublic resources. Arizona Proposition 200 requires state and local agencies to verify the \nidentity and eligibility, based on immigration status, of applicants for non-federally \nmandated state public benefits. These included homeless shelters, identification cards and \nhealth resources, for example. As Bianca, a 24-year-old transmujer5 from New York,  \ndescribed, “no tienes acceso ni siquiera para el seguro medico, ni tratas de visitar al \ndoctor, o te da miedo salir a calles, no, o viajar…te da como pánico….” “you don’t have \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \n5 Transmujer is the Spanish translation for transwoman. \n \t\r  65 \naccess not even to medical insurance, so you don’t visit the doctor, or you are afraid to \nbe out in the streets. Or even traveling…it makes you like panic….” Bianca described \nundocuqueer as being vulnerable to the state, given the ways her immigration status \nprevented her from accessing medical resources pertinent to her gender identity and \nsexuality. It imposed unwarranted fear, strife and uncertainty in her every day life. \nJulian, a 21-year-old cisgender man from North Carolina, shared a similar \nexperience, but more so coping with the constant state of vulnerability he faced as a non \nDACA-eligible immigrant. \n…when it comes to me, it's like receiving medical care or information about \nhealth-related issues or getting those type of services, those are things that I can’t \n[access] because sometimes they ask for Social Security or they ask for residency \nor citizenship, things that I don't have. Or an ID, they ask for these things that I \ndon't have. So, you know, these resources that are out there for LGBT people, \nsometimes I can't get a hold of them because I am who I am. I am undocumented. \nAnd also, you know, marriage is something, but it's something that is not really \nconcerning me now. Something concerning me now is getting a legal status so \nthat I don't have to fear for myself, being sent back to a country where, you know, \npeople are not as open-minded or as accepting. These are the things that I struggle \nwith day-to-day. \nThe vulnerability imposed by both social and material limitations highlighted Julian’s \ndaily struggles for persistence. Not qualifying for DACA as a result of his U.S. arrival \ndate made the prospect of deportation all the more real for him, as unlike his DACA-\neligible peers, he was not protected. Hence, being deported to a country that he barely \n \t\r  66 \nremembered and that was less tolerant of LGBTQ people posed a formidable threat that \nshaped his every day life. \nOther participants talked about undocuqueer as increasing their susceptibility to \ndiscrimination not only based on their gender, sexuality and immigration status, but also \nother forms of discrimination tied to their embodied culture. Bianca, for example, \ndescribed the uncertainty she experienced living at the cultural intersection of gender \nidentity, sexuality and immigration status. She described being vulnerable to employment \ndiscrimination for being transgender, as well as labor rights violations for not speaking \nEnglish and not having papers.  \n…nosotras como comunidad LGBT, aparte de que somos parte de la comunidad \nLGBT, somos Latino, somos personas que no hablamos el Ingles. Cuando \nconseguimos un trabajo, no nos pagan bien, y no nos dan trabajo por no tener \ndocumentos, como también en veces por ser transgenero en la comunidad LGBT. \nY no, no lo dan. Asi que somos las personas que mas sufrimos, no?...Sabemos que \nson dos temas que afectan a la comunidad indocumentada, pero si eres una \npersona LGBT, te va afectar el doble. \nApart from being part of the LGBT community, we are Latinos/as, we are people \nthat do not speak English. When we find work, they don’t pay us well, and they \ndon’t give us work for not having papers, and sometimes even for being \ntransgender within the LGBT community. They just don’t. So we are the ones that \nsuffer the most, no?... We know these are two issues that affect the undocumented \ncommunity, but if you identify as LGBT, it is going to doubly affect you. \n \t\r  67 \nLabor rights violations and employment discrimination were most relevant to Bianca’s \nexperience as an transmujer. Bianca’s experience positioned her at a cultural intersection \nwith language, where her inability to speak English subjected her to exploitation and \nemployment discrimination as an undocumented transmujer. Though Bianca was able to \nresolve her immigration status and now holds legal permanent residency, she continues to \nself-identify as undocuqueer because she continues to feel the same level of oppression \nshe previously felt when she did not have papers. Though her legal permanent residency \nhas alleviated the criminalization she experienced as an undocumented immigrant, it did \nnothing to resolve the criminalization and policing she continues to experience as a \nLatina transmujer in New York. \nElias, a 23-year-old genderqueer immigrant from Washington, similarly shared \nhis difficulties just getting passed the job interview given his undocumented status and \ngender nonconformance. Though Elias attributed the lack of job opportunities to his \ninability to show proof of documentation, he also internalized the culpability of his \ngender expression for the decreased opportunities. He described undocuqueer as being \nsimultaneously vulnerable to multiple forms of discrimination. \nIn many ways, I would say there are times where like getting a job is kind of hard. \nAnd there was a time when I was like without a job for five months because I \ncouldn't find anything. And, you know me, I wear makeup, I don't care. Like, I get \nhowever I want and stuff. I was depressed for a minute because I was like, oh I'm \nundocumented, I don't have papers, I can't work here, I don't have a job. And then \nI thought it was an issue that I was gay too. I was like, I’m gay. Like, I don’t think \npeople want to hire me. I didn’t feel wanted. I didn’t feel like I fit in. \n \t\r  68 \nDeeply rooted anti-immigrant sentiment and the inherent prejudice toward LGBTQ folk \nprevented participants like Elias from securing employment opportunities that enabled \nthem to sustain their living and support their families. While DACA enabled eligible \nparticipants to temporarily disassociate from the inherent stigma towards “illegality”, the \nprospect of employment forced several to discipline and negotiate the expression of their \nsexual and gender identities. The simultaneity of these subtle forms of oppression, hence, \nserved to further marginalize non-DACA eligible immigrants (i.e., “bad” immigrants), \nand the visibility of their queerness as undesirable or bad.  \nOther participants described the ways their gender identity and expression, \nsexuality and undocumented status sensitized them to the legal and social repercussions \nof their identities. Jesse, a 23-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, for example, \ndescribed how the vulnerability imposed by his identities made him hyper-aware of his \nenvironment.  \nSo even waking up every single day and walking out, it is scary to be either \nidentity. Like if I walk too late, am I going to get killed because I am gay? Or is \nthe police going to stop me because I am Mexican and question something? And \nif they take me in, what is that going to mean because I am queer? It’s a lot of \nthese things that people don't have to think about, but everything that we do…like \nthe fact that you were holding [your boyfriend’s] hand or that I was like grabbing \nyour arm. In spaces like that, what does that mean like for us to have a hate crime, \nand if it wasn't a hate crime when it comes down to like, oh you are \nundocumented, you have DACA, it’s going to affect your everything. So I think \nevery day it’s like, it’s a higher stress level of everything that we do that we have \n \t\r  69 \nto double think. Instead of just doing it, like you have to think about it even more \nto really explore the idea of what does this mean. \nJesse described how homophobia and policing affected the way he navigated his \neveryday interactions. He described having to tread lightly around the intersection of his \nidentities in order to mitigate the risks of potential negative legal and social \nconsequences. Jesse, as well as other participants, described internalizing the \ninstitutionalized discrimination and allowing these exclusions to discipline the outness \nand expression of his social identities.  \nFelix, a 28-year-old DACA recipient from Florida, similarly described being \nconstantly afraid, given both the legal and social repercussions of being LGBTQ and \nundocumented. He described both the tangible and intangible consequences of living at \nthe liminal borderland of undocuqueer resultant from both anti-LGBTQ and anti-\nimmigrant sentiment. \nYou know, it just makes everything different and everything very difficult. Like, \nyou know, I always felt like I had to work 10 times harder for anything that I \nwanted just because I didn't have papers. And then the fact that I had to constantly \nbe afraid of being rejected by my family when I was younger, it just made \neverything much worse. Not only because, I mean, there are tangible things like, \noh you can't get a driver’s license. That is very tangible, right, and then there are \nall the intangible things like, you can't date if you are in the closet. You can't have \na normal teenage experience when you are constantly afraid of your family, and \nthen you're constantly afraid of the state. Like there is no safe haven for you. And \nthen there are other things, right, like I felt like for a long time that I was \n \t\r  70 \nconstantly afraid of people just beating me up. Because, I don't know, like I was \nconstantly trying to look more “straight,” and I felt like I wasn't. Or that I wasn't \nstraight-acting, I guess. I was also afraid of my peers. I had this overwhelming \nfear on every sector of my life. \nWhile internalized fear overwhelmingly affected the way Felix performed his gender and \nensued the coming out process as LGBTQ, his inability to qualify for particular state \nbenefits (e.g., marriage, ID, license, college, financial aid, healthcare etc.) as a result of \nhis immigration status engrossed the unnecessary hardship he experienced. His \nvulnerability to the state, hence, similarly had implications for the ways he interacted and \nworked within the intersection of undocuqueer, given pervasive anti-LGBTQ and anti-\nimmigrant sentiment. \nExclusion within spaces of belonging. Participants additionally described how \ntheir illegibility as undocumented immigrants similarly had a direct impact on the ways \nthey experienced their LGBTQ identity. Due to their lack of access to state IDs and \ndriver’s licenses, for example, participants were often unable to access LGBTQ spaces, \nlike nightclubs, where they were able to engage with other folks based on their shared \nLGBTQ identity. Tommy, a 24-year-old DACA recipient from California, described the \nimportance of LGBTQ social spaces for his identity development, and recounted his \nincreased vulnerability to rejection as a result of not being able to demonstrate a standard \nstate-issued ID at the door. \nWell, and I think I see that as, as queer people one of the biggest things that we \nare introduced to from the beginning is this scene of like clubs and the spaces that \ncenters where we all like come together like just as who we are, not as outsiders \n \t\r  71 \nlike in our normal lives and the general society where queer people are not that \nvisible. You come to the space and you're introduced to it. Part of the process in \ngoing in is proving that you are of age and you have to give your identification. \nSome people don’t have state IDs, these plastic things that are really tiny, right. \nYou have to start taking this like huge passport and getting these looks, and \nmostly when you go into the spaces that are not really of color, we would get \nthese looks, so why do you have this passport? Why do you show me a passport \ninstead of a state ID? And also thinking about the fact that sometimes we were \ndenied entrance to the spaces, it created a sense of disempowerment, because \nyou're supposed to be out having fun with friends or whoever you want and then \nthis happened. Oh we can't get into the club… And it's not just going out \nnecessarily that requires you to show a state ID. Part of being queer is just like \nalso being visible. Presenting what you have to do and showing whatever type of \nidentification that is required at certain places, and so it's a constant bashing of \nyour undocumented self. \nHaving to present their matriculas6 or DACA cards and being rejected because they were \nnot considered valid forms of ID, participants described the sense of vulnerability they \nfelt as a result of their exclusion. Draco, a 26-year-old cisgender man from Arizona, for \nexample, described feeling anxious about going into LGBTQ social spaces with his \npassport, given the scrutiny he constantly underwent. He described undocuqueer as \nincreasing his chances of being rejected within both the mainstream LGBTQ and \nimmigrant communities. \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  \t\r  6\t\r  Matriculas\t\r  are consular identification cards, a form of identification accepted by several states, \nmunicipalities, and businesses. \t\r  \n \t\r  72 \nFor the longest time I didn't want to go to the club either or I would wait until \neverybody would kind of go in because I would have my big old passport from \nMexico, right, and I was like, I'm giving myself away. So I guess it impacted my \nsocial life in that way. Not only in being able to talk to men but also choosing \nwhat clubs I wanted to go to. And for the longest time I avoided [specific clubs] \nbecause I didn't know how they were going to react my passport, right. \nDraco’s susceptibility to rejection not only dictated the type of spaces he chose to partake \nin, but also the men he decided to engage with. He described feeling most comfortable \ngoing to spaces where showing a passport at the door was not uncommon. He described \nseeking out people of color spaces, where he was able to engage with people that looked \nlike him. \nI think in the beginning of me coming out as queer I really put up a wall when it \ncame to talking to people, especially men about my status. And I guess I was \nbeing racist, racially profiling people like, oh he's brown, he probably understands \nwhat I'm going through, right. I would be so scared of like White people. To tell \nthem that I was undocumented was very scary for me. And for the longest time, I \navoided really getting into any relationship with anyone that I didn't know was \nundocumented because I was afraid of how they were going to take it. \nDraco shared how he felt most comfortable engaging with other Latino men because of \ntheir perceived relatability to the immigrant experience. For Draco, surrounding himself \nwith others who shared his experience was safer than making himself vulnerable to anti-\nimmigrant sentiment perpetuated by dissimilar others. Aware of the social implications of \n \t\r  73 \nhis undocumented status, Draco was most concerned with mitigating points of tension \nwith potential partners by eliminating the risk of rejection involved with self-disclosure.  \nAlex, a 20-year-old DACA recipient from Connecticut, similarly described his \nexperience negotiating the liminal space between concealing his undocumented status \nand self-disclosing within LGBTQ spaces. \nQueer spaces are predominantly White where I come from, so it was really hard \nto find queer people that were of color. So when I did find queer people of color \nand I came out as undocumented to them, they were a lot more accepting. So I felt \nlike when there was other White people, I just always had to decide if I wanted to \ncome out as undocumented in those queer spaces because I was like, you know, I \ncan tell them that I’m undocumented but they’re not going to offer the support or \nthey might not react the way that I want, so it’s mostly just a way of me trying to \nprotect myself. \nDistrust for institutions and dissimilar others subjugated participants to often dissemble \ntheir undocumented status. Their status invoked a certain level of vulnerability that \nresulted in a heightened level of sensitivity for sharing personal information. Hence, the \nrisks of coming out often outweighed the benefits, given the prospect of social rejection, \ntargeting and lack of understanding. \nJoel, a 30-year-old DACA recipient from California, described the impact of the \ninaccessibility of LGBTQ social spaces on his sense of self. He described opting out of \nparticipating in these spaces for much of his coming-of-age due to prior experiences with \nrejection and exclusion. \n \t\r  74 \nI really didn't start going out to clubs and dancing and drinking until I was like \n23-24, and it was because when I was 18, I had a very, you know, unfortunate and \npainful situation where I was in line, I was getting ready to go in and I had my \nmatricula, and I wasn't allowed to go in. And it was just so unfortunate and I \nthink it really traumatized me to a certain degree, and I didn't want to deal with \nthat anymore.  \nBeing rejected from LGBTQ social spaces as a result of his undocumented status, and not \nbeing able to do anything about it, he described feeling unwelcome to partake in LGBTQ \nculture. His experience tainted his sense of belonging within the LGBTQ community, and \ndelayed his development of comfort engaging LGBTQ culture.  \nMatriculas are often the only form of identification undocumented immigrants \nhad access to besides DACA, which only a small segment of the undocumented \npopulation was eligible for. For this reason, when businesses opted to not accept them as \na form of proper identification, it constituted a form of discrimination against \nundocumented immigrants. As Josh, a 25-year-old DACA recipient from California, \nstated: \nEven when they don't take your fucking matricula at the club. They be like, oh I \nam sorry you cannot get in. I'm like, dude I live in San Francisco you are \nsupposed to be like a progressive city and you don't let undocumented people in \nyour club? Because allegedly queers are not undocumented? I don't understand. \nAnd it's not even just about the club. It is more about how people perceive you as \nsomething of a lesser level than them simply because of that. \n \t\r  75 \nFor Josh, as well as other participants, nightclubs represented the only available safe \nspaces for them to truly liberate their LGBTQ identities. Hence, when they were denied \nentry, they were left socially displaced and without recourse to other LGBTQ safe spaces \nconducive to their sexual identity development.  \nRecognizing their vulnerability to exclusion even within LGBTQ spaces, \nparticipants described not feeling part of the broader LGBTQ community. For eligible \nparticipants, DACA resolved some of these tensions by providing them legal presence \nand extending eligibility to some state public benefits (e.g., ID and driver’s license) that \nallowed them easier entry into these spaces. However, because DACA did not supplant \nstate-issued identification cards, in states where state IDs and drivers’ licenses were \ndenied to DACA recipients (e.g., Arizona and Nebraska), undocuqueers continued to \nexperience the same type of exclusion from LGBTQ social spaces as they did before. For \nnon-DACA-eligible participants, their ineligibility for state IDs and driver’s licenses in \nmost states (except California, New Mexico, Washington, Utah) continued to subject \nthem to unwarranted scrutiny. Obtaining a state ID and driver’s license, for many, helped \nfacilitate their ability to celebrate their sexuality within LGBTQ spaces. \nManaging interpersonal experiences. Participants also described the ways in \nwhich their sexuality and immigration status interestingly impacted interpersonal \nrelationships. They described recognizing the implications of their sexuality and \nimmigration status on their ability to manage relationships, and obtain the support they \nneeded.  \nCamilo, a 20-year-old cisgender man from Massachusetts, described trying to \nnavigate the barriers to higher education as an undocumented student, while \n \t\r  76 \nsimultaneously trying to develop a positive self-concept as a gay man. Overcome with a \nsense of silence, as inflicted by each of these identities and others’ lack of understanding, \nCamilo described having to cope with this simultaneous process in utter reclusion.  \n… at the same time that I was going through this moment of crisis with college \napplications where I was hanging off a cliff—you know, I was in this moment \nwhere I was like you need to tell someone and ask for help, or you are not going \nget this done, which like I said was the single most defeating period of my life. At \nthe same time, I was going through a really tumultuous relationship in which I felt \ncompletely isolated, which was completely secret for 99% of the duration—a year \nand three months. And that completely went hand-in-hand. My inability to talk \nabout my undocumented status and my inability to be completely open and secure \nin this relationship had just a really completely detrimental effect physically, \nmentally, and emotionally. It completely wore me out and it resulted in \nunfortunate consequences for the relationship. And I had no doubt in my mind \nthat if I was not undocumented or the circumstances had been set up to where I \nhad the support that I needed even as an undocumented immigrant that \nrelationship would have continued in an incredibly healthy direction. \nCamilo described feeling completely isolated, as though there was no one that could truly \nunderstand or support him. Feeling unable to ask for help during the college admissions \nprocess without revealing his undocumented status, he described feeling helpless. \nSimultaneously, having to maintain his relationship a secret, Camilo described not being \nable to truly rely on others for emotional support.  \n \t\r  77 \nAs a result of my undocumented status I grew up with a sense of complete \nindependence—not entirely the good kind. The kind where you feel that there is \nno one that can help you or truly understands what your situation is, even when \nthat is not true. Even when that is actually quite irrational. You know, I think that \nas an undocumented individual, you tend to apply that to every single scenario in \nyour life. I found that particularly for me, it rendered me unable to ask for help, \nwhich I absolutely think impacted my queerness. In the sense that you are already \nisolated in either of those identities. Imagine combining them, and the isolation \nand the inability to reach out to people, and the inability to feel like anybody truly \nunderstands where you are coming from. \nThe sense of silence perpetuated by the compartmentalization of his undocuqueer \nidentity, given the stigma attached to being LGBTQ and undocumented, pushed Camilo \nto navigate these experiences on his own. \nMario, a 28-year-old DACA recipient from Florida, shared a similar experience \ncoming to terms with his LGBTQ identity during the same time that he was confronted \nwith the barriers to higher education as an undocumented student. He described dealing \nwith the psychological turmoil of coming out to his family, while simultaneously \nnavigating a relationship, and feeling stuck struggling to find an institution that would \nallow him an opportunity based on his merit, not his immigration status. \nBoth things hit me really hard my senior year of high school. I was reaching \ngraduation and this was the point that all the differences kind of accumulated and \ncompounded. I didn't have a life since I didn't have a Social Security, my friends \nwere applying for study abroad, my friends were applying to college, my friends \n \t\r  78 \nhad cars, my friends were seeking a better life in the future, and I was stuck. And \nat the same time, I was trying to figure out the future with me and my boyfriend, \nif like I don't know what my future is and he is moving on with his future. So as it \nhappens, my second semester of my senior year in high school I was with my \nboyfriend for Valentine's Day and then someone caught us together, my sister, \nand she pretty much chased him out of the house and started crying. And the \ncoming out process with my sister was extraordinarily difficult because she was \nnot accepting whatsoever. She was really devastated, she said she was very \ndisappointed. \nMario described how the educational limitations imposed by his undocumented status \ncreated uncertainty for the future of his relationship with his partner, as his partner was \nmoving forward with his plans, while Mario felt stuck. At the same time, the cultural \nstigma invoked by the visibility of his relationship fractured and strained the relationship \nhe had with his family, who refused to accept Mario as gay. Navigating the liminal space \nat the intersection of his undocuqueer experience forced Mario to almost immediately \nlose two reliable sources of support that he was dependent of for navigating the different \nfacets of his experience.  \nOther participants described how their inability to qualify for state public benefits \naffected their relationships with their partners. Much of it had to do with their partners’ \ninability to fully understand the state of vulnerability imposed by participants’ \nundocumented status. Antonia, a 32 year old genderqueer immigrant from Arizona, for \nexample, described constantly being aware of the limitations of her status, and how those \n \t\r  79 \nlimitations strained the sustainability of her relationship with her girlfriend, given the \nunnecessary strain on their lives. \nShe always knew my status, but she didn't understand it. So when she came out as \na Marine, you know, proud and wanting to take me to her military days, that's \nwhen she really got to understand what it meant to be undocumented. She didn't \nknow. She thought that I could do everything she could. She wanted to show me \noff with her officers like, this is my girlfriend. She's the one that supported me, \npero right there we felt like trapped. She wanted me to go visit her at boot camp \nand right away I told her, no, I can't. No, they are going to ask me for una \nidentificación I don't have. All I have is my Mexican passport. It was kind of \nfrustrating just at those points. And for me she was living over there [in \nCalifornia] and I was living in Arizona, and just to cross that little line [the state \nborder] it was dangerous. \nAntonia described not being able to partake in significant moments of her partner’s life \ndue to her inability to qualify for an ID or driver’s license in the state of Arizona. She \nalso described constantly being afraid of getting pulled over when she would visit her \npartner across the state border, given border patrol inspections. Having to deal with the \nvulnerability imposed by her social limitations, and the pervasive sense of fear invoked \nby her undocumented status, Antonia ended her relationship after two and a half years. \nHer undocumented status made it very difficult to maintain a mixed-status relationship. \nSocial limitations not only affected participants within relationships, but also the \nway participants approached interactions with others. Dating, in general, was a process \nthat participants approached with ambivalence, as the implications imposed by their \n \t\r  80 \nundocumented status, specifically, always invoked the need for self-disclosure. For \nparticipants, the need to divulge their undocumented status as a disclaimer to a \nrelationship was a vulnerable process in and of itself. Joel, for example, described his \nundocumented status as unnecessary baggage that interrupted the organic flow of dating. \nI think, you know, in terms of dating, it definitely a plays a big role, right, in \nchoosing who to date knowing that you are undocumented, and in this burden that \nis placed on you to educate your partners about, you know, what does it mean to \nbe undocumented, what's that reality like, and some of the dynamics that your \npartner needs to be aware of, right, given that you are undocumented. I think that \nfor me, it was very draining. It was very heavy. It was this process of when do I \ntell people that I'm undocumented. Is it the first time that we are talking? Is it on \nthe first date? On the third date? Is it before we have sex, right? So I think that it \nreally chipped away really having an authentic experience with a partner, whether \nit was just dating or being boyfriends with someone, or just meeting someone at \nclub and then, you know, having sex with this person.  \nGiven the potential barriers to a future relationship, Joel described the burden placed on \nhim to constantly have to come out when interacting with prospective partners. He shared \nhow though he had no control over the limitations of his status, he did have control over \nthe meaning he ascribed to his experiences and how he responded to these situations. \nHence, redefining what it meant to be undocumented really allowed him to take \nownership of how he experienced dating processes.  \nIt wasn't until later when I was able to definitely, you know, start going clubbing \nand enjoying that, you know, that part of being young for me. And now I feel I \n \t\r  81 \nhave a better understanding of how the system works and what these identities \nand experiences and moments mean to me that I'm able to sort of now really take \nownership of who I date, why I date, and when do I have sex, and who do I have \nsex with. You know, I feel like I'm in a place of more control and more of a, I \ndecide how those things happen and with who. But it has definitely impacted me, \nand it has taken me a while to say, you know, like hey, being undocumented \nshould not impact, it shouldn't have an effect on these type of situations, right. \nAnd that they might, right, still have an impact, but now I'm in a place of \nchoosing.  \nLike Joel, Daniel, a 21-year-old DACA recipient from Connecticut, similarly \ndescribed his undocumented status as a scarlet letter. He regarded it as something that \nwas crucial for his partners to be able to understand, as it ultimately shaped and \ninfluenced Daniel’s ability to interact within a relationship. \nI mean, in terms of like potential partners or potential boyfriends or whatever, my \nstatus is going to be in the back of my mind. And sort of having to come out to \nanother person, that gets kind of messy so I try not to dabble into that. But \nassuming they may not know about any immigrant rights issues or the \nconsequences of my status, that may be something that could potentially be a \nbarrier to a future relationship or at least be a challenge or bridge or even just \nanother coming out. Because, I mean, at least at this point in my life, I'm kind of \npretty open about those things, but I'm not going to, I don't know, well I might \nmention it on our first date, but it's still something that I’m kind of tired of doing, \nbut that I know I will need to keep doing in the foreseeable future. \n \t\r  82 \nDaniel described coming out as a never-ending process. The unresolved nature of his \nstatus forced him to constantly have to educate others about its implications on his ability \nto sustain a relationship. In this sense, it was not necessarily that being undocumented \nruined the potential in a relationship, but rather that having to constantly explain what \nthat meant, and significant others never quite fully understanding was discouraging. As \nJulian described: \nSo there's a lot of explaining to do to someone once they find out that I am \nactually undocumented. I guess for me it kind of ruins the relationship because it \nbecomes this conversation of like having to explain everything. And of course \nyou always think about one day we will go to Paris or we will go somewhere, but \nat the back of your head you're always thinking I cannot go because I am \nundocumented. I cannot go because I will not be able to get back. So it kind of \nbrings this extra thing into the relationship where you have to explain everything.  \nNavigating the intersection of sexuality and undocumented status placed the onus on \nparticipants to have to educate significant others about the implications of their status. \nBecause partners were unable to fully understand what it meant to be undocumented, \nunless they themselves were undocumented, participants were often discouraged from \nengaging with dissimilar others. \nMaria, a 23-year-old DACA recipient from Florida, described power dynamics \nresultant from her positionality as a queer undocumented woman. Given the interplay of \ngender, sexuality and immigration status in her life, she described her experience as \nvulnerable. \n \t\r  83 \nI think being undocumented has also influenced my ability to develop intimate \nrelationships with people, which is very interesting because when we often think \nabout immigration, we think about the role that the state has, we think of the role \nthat policymakers have, or even the role that imperialism has, but we don't really \ntalk about sexuality and immigration and the power that can come about when \nyou are a woman and you’re undocumented and you’re in a relationship with \nsomebody. Because regardless of who that person is, if they had papers, there is a \npower dynamic there. So it has definitely affected my life because I don't have a \nproblem finding people, it's just that I am very cautious with whom I get involved \nwith because I think being undocumented gives you this sort of innate protective \nnature, and also with being a woman, I don't trust most men to begin with. So \nthere is a lot of things there.  \nMaria shared the overwhelming sense of vulnerability she experienced engaging in \nrelationships with others as a result of her undocumented status. This feeling was in \nresponse to the marginalization she experienced as an undocuqueer woman, and the fear \nshe carried resultant from the animus against LGBTQ and undocumented immigrants \ninscribed by law.  \nMario similarly talked about the way his undocumented status and sexuality were \npreviously used against him within the context of dating. Mario’s positionality as a gay \nundocumented man invoked a power differential within his mixed-status relationship that \nmade him increasingly vulnerable to subjugation and manipulation. \nSo I think that the biggest factor that plays into being a gay man and being \nundocumented is relationships because in many of my relationships, it was a \n \t\r  84 \nstrain on the relationship for me. The frustration and feeling that my self-worth \nwas not there. My frustration was there and they both kind of poisoned past \nrelationships. Well, more than that it was also used in many of my relationships as \na factor to hold me down. To tether me to a bad relationship or another. For \ninstance, I had a boyfriend that I was dating for two and a half years, and that \nboyfriend ended up cheating, and he told me, you can't leave me because who else \nis going to marry you for your papers? He also had said, if you leave I'm going to \ncall the police. I left anyways. I wasn't going to be tethered to that kind of \nemotional abuse that he was placing me under, but for many individuals who do \nnot understand that, when you are living in a conservative community, and a \ncommunity that doesn't embrace either community, LGBT or undocumented \npeople, but also when you're placed in a vulnerable spot with individuals who try \nto use your undocumented status against you, that's when it all builds up against \nyou.  \nMario described how his undocumented status influenced his inability to protect himself \nduring his two and half year relationship. The legal and social repercussions of his \nundocuqueer identity threatened his safety and well being, and further perpetuated the \nlow sense of self he described experiencing as a result of his multiply-marginalized \nidentity.  \nDarcy, a 21-year-old recent legal permanent resident from North Carolina, \nsimilarly described the simultaneity of her oppression at the intersection of gender, \nsexuality and immigration status. A survivor of sexual assault, she shared her \n \t\r  85 \nvulnerability as a bisexual, undocumented woman, and described the ways that her \nmultiply-marginalized identity contributed to her targeting. \nI remember that I was raped in college and I was scared that, you know, if I went \nto the police then they would ask me about my status. I don't know, I feel like it \nwould be my fault that if I was deported I would leave my family. I would be the \none that caused my little brother to lose his sister, I would be the one that caused \nmy parents to like go through pain after all the hard work that they put for me to \ncome to the states. So I didn't go to the hospital. I thought that I couldn't go and I \nwas scared and I didn't tell them. And it just so happens, that in that particular \nincident I was targeted because I was perceived to be bi[sexual]. There was a lot \nof sexual exploitation going on, but a lot of abuse because of my sexual identity \nand my immigration status because he knew that I didn't have papers. He knew \nthat I was queer and that I was trying to find a space to come out. And I thought it \nwas a good space to come out to him, but things just didn't work out that way.  \nDarcy was very aware of the ways that her gender and sexuality, compounded with her \nundocumented status, influenced her positionality during that experience. She alluded to \nthe power differentials inflicted by her multiply-marginalized identity, and described her \nsubjugation as an undocuqueer woman.  \nWell so, it was definitely used against me so many countless times, but it was \ndifferent in the sense that me as a woman, me as a queer woman, like I was \nsexually harassed, I was sexually exploited in ways that men generally aren't… \nBut you know there is a whole sexual experience to it that has to do a lot with \nharassment, abuse, and exploitation that I never would have experienced if I had \n \t\r  86 \npapers. I would've never had to worry that there was a looming threat of \ndeportation or looming threat of being separated, because I don't think what \nworried me the most was being deported. What worried me the most was being \nseparated from like my little brother, from my family and from my mom and from \nmy dad, and having to go to Costa Rica and explain everything to my family back \nin Costa Rica. Like, that would have forced me to come out to them and that \nwould've forced me to, you know, that's not something that I think I will ever be \nready for because that means that I will be cut off from my family. \nDarcy’s narrative highlights the way her identities were interconnected and how they \ncontributed to her vulnerability as an undocuqueer woman. Because her undocumented \nstatus forced her to consider the reality of deportation and the consequences of family \nrejection as related to her LGBTQ identity, she bypassed opportunities to report the \nincident in order to mitigate the risks. She, like other participants, described how the \nthreat of being deported to a country less tolerant of LGBTQ people prevented her from \nseeking out the support she needed as a survivor of oppression. \nComplexity: Developing Complex Self-Definitions \nRecognizing their vulnerability to anti-immigrant, xenophobic and heterosexist \npower structures, participants developed a tolerance for living in a world that is not rigid. \nTheir positionality challenged participants to (re)create their own self-definitions as \ncomplex and intersectional beings (i.e., undocuqueer). It enabled them to develop \ncomfort living in a third space (Anzaldúa, 1987) where they were simultaneously \nLGBTQ and undocumented, not just one or the other. Hence, they described the \n \t\r  87 \nintersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience as being complexly \nintertwined. As Franco described:  \nSo undocuqueer is the two identities that intersect, and one of them is \nundocumented and all the issues that come along with that. And the other is being \nqueer, and all the issues that come along with that. At the same time, because I am \nboth identities, I identify as undocuqueer. Always I identify with one of each, but \nI never stop being one or the other. So that is what I take pride in, and I also \nbecome aware to what those issues are and how to fight against them. Just come \nto more of a liberty of my identity. \nFor Franco, undocuqueer meant indivisibility. It meant living at the intersection of two \nsocial identities. He described how his undocumented status made, impacted and \ninfluenced his LGBTQ identity—and vise versa—in a way that allowed his undocuqueer \nidentity to become more expansive and rich.  \nJoel similarly shared how his undocuqueer identity broadened his understanding \nof what it means to be undocumented and LGBTQ within the context of the U.S. \n…if I had been born here or if I had gained some sort of residency, citizenship in \nthis country at an early age, it's hard for me to think that I would have this critical \nanalysis of these two identities and the systems that oppress both identities \nseparately, but also interconnectedly. So to me it's like, not that I'm glad, right, but \nI'm just grateful that I have allowed my undocumented immigrant status to \ncomplicate my queer identity and allowing for that to happen even in moments \nwhen I don't understand what it really means. And so it is almost like, maybe if I \nhadn't been undocumented, maybe I would've been stuck in the sort of very \n \t\r  88 \nnarrow queer, more gay identity where marriage equality, [is] as far as I would've \ngotten... and I think maybe the opposite too, right. That may be if I had been a \nresident or citizen or had been given some sort of [lawful] immigration status at \nan early age, maybe I would've had a more narrow concept and understanding of \nimmigrant rights in this country. So I feel like these two identities definitely \ncomplicate each other, make things a lot messier for me, but also allow me to \nreally experience a more rich understanding and view of what the world means to \nme, given these two identities that I have fully taken ownership of and have \nchallenged and have given different meanings to in the different stages of my life. \nBeing positioned at the intersection of sexuality and immigration status allowed \nparticipants like Joel to better understand the ways systems of oppression are interlocked \nand interrelated. His experience ultimately forced him to develop a more critical analysis \nof his identity and the systems he simultaneously interacted within.  \nUndocuqueer to several participants signified comprehensively addressing \nthemselves, and no longer having to check any of their identities at the door. It \nrepresented an opportunity for participants to fully embrace their experience as LGBTQ \nand undocumented, and confront institutionalized oppression not in silos, but \nintersectionally. Patricia, a 25-year-old DACA recipient from Texas, described how her \nembodied complexity influenced the way she approached different spaces from a more \nintersectional lens. \nI come to work and I’m like, I'm a queer immigrant woman that cares about \nworkers rights, or cares about immigrants rights, who cares about LGBTQ rights, \nwho wants to make sure that people feel empowered either through civic \n \t\r  89 \nengagement or a community. So that's how I generally try to intersect all the \nidentities that I have. That's exactly it. I can't separate my identities, so why would \nI do that in other spaces? Because that's not building, I feel. That's why it's very \nimportant that in every space that you go to that all of these identities are claimed, \nso that we are able to start thinking through the many lenses that people have, \neven though we may not have that experience. \nParticipants believed that as queer and trans immigrants of color in this country, their \nwork, organizing, politics, and values should be informed by their lives. Being \nundocuqueer represented one of the most complex, interestingly intertwined, and radical \nidentities to be out as, given the social and legal repercussions associated with each \nidentity, and the polarization of our country around LGBTQ and immigrant rights issues. \nFor this reason, Patricia advocated for more complex understandings of identity reflective \nof her own complex self-definitions. \nDaniel similarly discussed how in order for others to begin to understand him, he \ntoo needed to understand himself complexly in a way that was not divided, but rather \nvery intentionally hyphenated and very intentionally together. \nI think it allows people to become critical thinkers, to become radical \nintersectional thinkers; to consciously challenge the norms that are constantly \nbeing reproduced around them and in front of them. I think it sort of allows \npeople to have an openness that is arguably unparalleled to any comparable sort \nof situation… \nDaniel sought to create spaces that were more radical, less normative, and more \nintersectional. Understanding himself complexly was a way of becoming more aware of \n \t\r  90 \nthe systems of oppression simultaneously working against and within his communities. \nWithout acknowledging our privilege and oppression within the different spaces we \noccupy, we cannot escape the oppressive, normative and abusive qualities of both \ncommunities.  \nResisting simplistic conceptions of identity. In line with the complexity \nparticipants attributed to their lived experiences, participants worked hard to develop \ntheir own public narrative outside of LGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks. They \nrejected discourse that they felt harmed them, and combated the consistent erasure of \ntheir experiences within the larger LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. Living \noutside of the margins of what it means to be LGBTQ and what it means to be \nundocumented within the social movement context of the U.S. imposed unwarranted \nvulnerability for undocuqueer activists that effectively denied their existence within \neither or both movements.  \nJesse reflected on his positionality as an undocuqueer activist, and described the \nways in which his complexity was often deemed expendable by the mainstream LGBTQ \nand immigrant rights movements. \nYou can be ignorant or blinded like how I was, saying that one thing does not \naffect the other, but if you sit down and really analyze it, like how it affects your \nevery single day—and it affects it so much! As an LGBT mainstream movement \nyou are not recognized. As an immigrant movement, you are not recognized. And \nyou are the negotiating piece.... We are always the negotiating piece, and our lives \nare not to be negotiated. Why is it that we are always the negotiating piece, and \nwhy is it that in our lives we have to be okay with that? And I think it was very \n \t\r  91 \npresent to me during this past Obama announcement, where I wanted to be happy \nbecause my parents were not queer and were benefiting from it, but the \nnegotiating piece. Nowhere in that [announcement] LGBT lives are \nacknowledged whatsoever. \nJesse described feeling constantly excluded from administrative efforts aimed at \nimproving the social condition of his communities. Pervasive normative assumptions and \nrhetoric exclusive of his positionality continued to exploit his body as one of the 28,500 \nbinational same-sex couples dependent on marriage equality, or one of the more than \n11.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in need of some type of relief, yet \nnever as one of the 267,000 LGBTQ-identified undocumented immigrants displaced from \nboth social movements due to their marginality (Gates, 2013). Participants, hence, \ndescribed their undocuqueer identity as a symbol of resistance to and liberation from \nnormative discourses of sexuality and immigration that reduced their experiences to \nsingle identity politics. As Lalo, a 27-year-old DACA recipient from California, stated, \nI think that if there wasn't an undocuqueer movement I don’t think there would be \na push back like against the criminalization of our trans brothers and sisters. I \ndon't think people would be fighting for deportation cases of an open gay male or \nfemale that is incarcerated for a minor crime. Injustices for these folks would not \nbe out there. People would not know that injustices are happening. \nParticipants described intentionally bringing undocuqueer to the forefront in an effort to \ncomplicate the conversations around what it means to be undocumented and also what it \nmeans to be LGBTQ—a complexity that single identity politics obscured and neglected.  \n \t\r  92 \nJoe, a 22-year-old DACA recipient from Nevada, described his undocuqueer \nidentity as a way to resist simplistic conceptions of identity, and hold movements \naccountable to broader inclusion. \nI think it helps people say, yes we are all undocumented, but we need to recognize \nthat some of us are going to be needing a little bit more in terms of rights than just \ncitizenship. The LGBT community… I think it helps hold them accountable in \nsaying like, if you’re going to advocate for marriage and advocate for all these \nthings that are going to help the LGBT community, then you better be advocating \nfor immigrant rights because that's an LGBT issue as well. \nFor Joe, immigrant rights were LGBTQ rights, and LGBTQ rights were immigrant rights. \nHis existence within both communities is what brought the two issues together. \nIdentifying as both LGBTQ and undocumented, Joe described how he never stopped \nbeing one or the other, and resisted the pressures to divide his identity within mainstream \nLGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks. Undocuqueer signified acknowledging the \ndiverse identities that exist within our communities, and doing work inclusive of their \nvoices and experiences.  \nPatricia similarly described her experience resisting the separation of her \nidentities within the different spaces she occupied. She described how the recognition of \nher own complexity enabled her advocate for the inclusion of other marginalized \nperspectives.  \nI saw how my immigration status was being discussed in one space, and then we \nwere told, don't talk about your sexual identity, don't mention it. And in LGBT \nspaces, I'm like, why are we not talking about these other identities that folks \n \t\r  93 \nhave, whether it's their immigration status or whether it's their socioeconomic \nbackground, that limit them to have resources in terms of what it means to be \nLGBT? I think it's just both of them pushed me to never divorce them at all. \nFor Patricia, being undocuqueer meant resisting the impulse to hide certain facets of her \nexperience in order to conform to single identity frameworks. She discussed having to \nown every single one of her identities in order to bring visibility to her non-normativity \nand incite conversations about how those identities were intertwined. \nMark, a 27-year-old DACA recipient from California, associated undocuqueer \nwith liberation. For him, it was about resisting the prescribed standards of what it means \nto be LGBTQ and what it means to be undocumented, and being able to express himself \nholistically as an LGBTQ undocumented man without feeling scrutinized for not \nconforming to the prescribed standards set forth by his LGBTQ or immigrant \ncommunities. \nY pos a la misma ves, decir undocuqueer, decir que yo soy undocuqueer también \nsignifica mi liberación. Sentirme libre de ser quien soy, ya ser una persona gay o \nindocumentada, y no sentirme juzgado o criticado ya sea por la comunidad \ninmigrante o la comunidad LGBT. \nAnd well at the same time, saying undocuqueer, saying that I am undocuqueer \nalso signifies my liberation. Me feeling free to be who I am, whether it be being \ngay or undocumented, and not feeling judged or criticized by the immigrant or \nLGBT communities. \nParticipants generally talked about the need to challenge normative scripts of collective \nidentity within LGBTQ and immigrant discourses in order to deconstruct essentialized \n \t\r  94 \nconceptions of identity, and uplift their non-normative experiences as undocuqueer. \nSantos, a 30-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, shared this sentiment, and described \nundocuqueer as important for dismantling the stigma attached to both (homo)sexuality \nand being undocumented.  \n…I felt that my whole life, my whole childhood, I needed to hide a certain part of \nmyself because of I was afraid if people knew who I was I wouldn't be liked. So \nthere is fear in coming out because you basically feel like as long as you are \nhiding you'll be safe. So for me, coming out meant not hiding anymore and giving \npeople a chance to know me for who I am, and if they choose to love me and be \nmy friends they will do so knowing who I am, not because I projected a certain \npart of me and I hid a certain other.  \nComing out as undocuqueer helped Santos participate in safe spaces more intentionally, \nand without the need to have to choose one identity over another.  \nDaniel best summarized this sentiment, proposing that safe spaces not go un-\ninterrogated. \n… the truth is that a lot of queer spaces remain racist and xenophobic and classist, \nand I think it's important to call out a space to challenge that.  Similarly, I think a \nlot of immigrant spaces, in general, a lot of immigration organizations remain \nhomophobic and sexist and possibly trans-phobic. And so I think it's important to \ntalk about these, again, to challenge that. \nLGBTQ and immigrant spaces were often regarded as safe spaces where participants \ncould identify with others based on their shared LGBTQ or undocumented identity. The \nimpulse to build collective identity with distinct group boundaries, however, often \n \t\r  95 \nperpetuated the consistent erasure of undocuqueer experiences at the overlapping margins \nof identity. Hence, Daniel proposed moving away from the oppressive, normative and \nabusive qualities of the larger LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements, and instead \ncreating spaces of resistance, where participants challenged normative assumptions and \nsimplistic conceptions of what it means to be LGBTQ and undocumented. Undocuqueer \nas a form of resistance to essentialized identity discourses was evidenced along \nheteronormative, homonormative, and DREAMer narratives. \nHeteronormativity. The emphasis placed on issues of family separation (i.e., \ndeportation) within immigrant rights frameworks placed undue emphasis on \nheteronormative relationships that helped suppress participants’ LGBTQ identities. While \nfamily separation and deportation were certainly relevant to undocuqueer immigrants, as \nthey too had families (chosen and/or biological), the unintended consequence of solely \norganizing around heterosexual relationships was that it reinscribed heteronormativity. \nCamilo, for example, described how heteronormative scripts within the immigrant rights \ndiscourses essentialized undocumented immigrants’ experiences, and marginalized \nLGBTQ experiences, including his own.  \nI think that I walked into a very heteronormative environment, which isn't to say \nthat it was a hostile environment, because that is not actually the sense that I got. \nIt wasn't hostile. It wasn't aggressive, you know, but it was heteronormative. The \ninteresting thing about heteronormativity is that it’s not particularly overt. It does \nnot necessarily have to be aggressive and it does not necessarily have to be \nintentionally hurtful or oppressive, but it is. \n \t\r  96 \nCamilo described not having a space to explore and critically reflect on his LGBTQ \nidentity, given the lack of visibility of LGBTQ issues within immigrant rights \nframeworks. The stories and narratives of LGBTQ immigrants were often not included \nwithin immigrant rights advocacy efforts, and that exclusion consequently made safe \nspaces unsafe for him, given his non-conformance to heterosexual standards. \n…when I walked into the spaces in 2011-2012 and up until very recently, it felt \nnot safe at all for me to be able to express both of my identities. I think it is \nimportant to also note that it may not have completely been reality. But I think it \nwas part of the trauma that I had experienced as a young person and in high \nschool that I felt that way, even though it may not necessarily have been the \nreality, even though folks may have been quite open to it or would not have \nreacted in any negative way, the trauma I think—I think this is very true—the \ntrauma, it colors, it tints your subsequent experiences so that you find it quite \ndifficult to experience reality as it fully is, because your experience and your \nperception of reality is distorted by trauma. \nCamilo described his uneasiness trusting his environment. He described the way his \nexperiences with oppression had influenced the way he interacted within different spaces.  \nFor Camilo, trauma invoked a sense of insecurity in identifying as both LGBTQ and \nundocumented. He had grown up with a fear of rejection as a result of his LGBTQ \nidentity that those experiences affected the way he approached even immigrant spaces.  \nEster, a 26-year-old transgender DACA recipient from Washington D.C., \ndescribed a similar experience becoming aware of heteronormativity within immigrant \n \t\r  97 \nspaces. For her, it was more about coming to the realization of her perceived difference \neven within safe spaces. \n…in terms of identity, it's something that took place actually by entering Latino \nimmigrants spaces that were meant to address my immigrant self, but neglected \nmy queer self. So that's when I really was confronted with like, okay, because at \nLGBTQ places I would enter queer, and people would hear my immigration \nrhetoric and background and not prioritize it, not try to understand it, but it wasn't \nan issue that I was an immigrant and queer. As opposed to many Latino \nimmigrant spaces, it was an issue that I was queer. So that's when I was actually \nconfronted with like, what am I? \nEster highlighted some of the ways in which heteronormativity manifested itself as \ntransphobia and the general exclusion of LGBTQ experiences within immigrant rights \nadvocacy work. This exclusion forced her to reconceptualize her own self-definition, and \nresist the compartmentalization of her embodied complexity. Coming out as \nundocumented and trans, hence, enabled her to disrupt taken-for-granted \nheteronormativity within immigrant spaces. \nDraco similarly resisted heteronormativity within organizing spaces by adopting \nan undocuqueer identity that challenged the invisibility of queer immigrants.  \nI see constantly, and it pisses me off, how the undocuqueer story is pushed to the \nside, and just brushed to the side because there is not a lot of undocuqueer \npresence in these organizations and a lot of these actions are being led by faith \norganizations. And I think when we are talking about immigration, or some type \n \t\r  98 \nof relief, we need to keep in mind that not everyone has a family, and families \nlook different, let's be honest.  \nDraco described recognizing the exclusivity of immigrant rights discourses when it came \nto LGBTQ concerns. Immigrant rights strategies often did not take into consideration \nissues of family rejection, the inaccessibility of marriage, and barriers to adoption that \nimplicate undocuqueer immigrants’ ability to benefit from heteronormative family-based \nimmigration processes and deferred action programs (e.g., DAPA). This erasure of \nLGBTQ experiences incited him to come out as undocuqueer and resist essentialized \nconceptions of undocumented immigrants as strictly heterosexual. \nJoel identified a similar experience, and confronted the heteronormativity \nundergirding immigrant rights work by highlighting the presence and leadership of \nLGBTQ folk, as well as the blatant disregard for their experiences within existing \nframeworks. \nI started to see that there were other queer people or people part of the LGBTQ \ncommunity, but no one brought that up. People just kept talking about their \nundocumented identity. To me it was very intriguing to see that identity, that \nenergy, and those faces, but no one really vocalizing it and acknowledging it until \nI sort of started questioning, you know, myself and those folks around me. And so \nI felt that the only way that I could, in a way, open up the space for that identity to \nbecome acknowledged was for me to sort of say, hey like I'm not just \nundocumented, I'm also gay, also queer, and we need to figure out ways to bring \nthat in, and to start to integrate that type of work and those identities and \nexperiences. \n \t\r  99 \nFor Joel, sharing his undocuqueer identity created opportunities for others to develop and \ncritically reflect on their sexual identities. Coming out resisted the underlining \nheteronormativity that unitary identity politics generated within immigrant rights \nframeworks. \nHomonormativity. Participants also highlighted how the mainstream LGBTQ \nrights movement tended to the experiences of a particular LGBTQ demographic that did \nnot necessarily include undocumented folk. Many felt that this demographic consisted \nprimarily of White, citizen, gay males, even though the movement often claimed to \nrepresent the entire LGBTQ spectrum. Josh, for example, shared how he did not \nnecessarily feel recognized as part of the LGBTQ community. \nI feel like the immigrant rights movement has been a little bit more receptive. I \ndon't know about necessarily the gay movement people. I don't necessarily know \nif that is something that we are recognized as part of the community too, like, oh \nthere is undocumented queers? I don't necessarily feel like that is how it's been. I \nfeel like that movement represents a certain demographic of people that don't \nreally associate themselves with us. \nTo help reshape the mainstream LGBTQ narrative, participants actively sought \nopportunities to increase the mainstream LGBTQ community’s awareness of \nundocuqueers. Lalo, for example, used his undocuqueer identity to challenge \nhomornormative scripts that did not necessarily address his identity as an undocumented \nimmigrant within the LGBTQ community.  \nIt has also been discussions about the criminalization of queers, and not just \nspecifically undocuqueers, but anybody that is queer.  I feel that the value of \n \t\r  100 \nundocuqueer work is high, leading all of the same issues that a lot of the LGBT \nnonprofits do, but adding this extra layer of undocumented, the undocumented \npopulation, and adding this extra layer of how being undocumented puts you at a \nhigher risk of all these other things that all these other organizations work for. \nFor Lalo, it was more about highlighting the exclusion of undocuqueer folk when \nconversations about LGBTQ issues did not take into account the undocumented \nexperience. It was about highlighting the diversity within the LGBTQ community that \nmainstream narratives were not taking into account.  \nTommy utilized his personal story as a tool for challenging the homonormativity \nof the LGBTQ rights movement, as well as the community’s perception of what it means \nto be undocuqueer. \nAs an undocumented person I think it was feeling like when we were in queer \nspaces that are dominated by a non-immigrant narrative, that I can use those \nfeelings of being undocumented and share them or that I could share those \nexperiences with those communities that are not aware of immigrant folk who are \nalso queer. \nFor Tommy, sharing his story was particularly important for creating awareness of the \nhomonormativity underlining current LGBTQ advocacy efforts. Highlighting \nundocuqueers’ systematic exclusion from LGBTQ victories was important for dispelling \nessentialized notions of what LGBTQ rights are. Particularly frustrating for Jesse was the \nfact that undocuqueer immigrants were consistently glossed over by the broader LGBTQ \nrights movement. He described his exclusion as follows: \n \t\r  101 \n…it's supposed to be the home of the LGBT, fighting for our rights, but the fact \nthat you are undocumented, or even bigger, the fact that you're an immigrant or \nperson of color, being left out of this vision is what I think affects me more, \nbecause any win that we have gotten as queer people most of the time has not \nbeen a win for myself or my community.  \nJesse experienced his LGBTQ and undocumented identity as interconnected. Situated at \nthe overlapping margins of two socially repressed identities, it was almost impossible for \nhim to benefit from the victories of the LGBTQ rights movement, given his \nundocumented status.  \nFor example, call marriage a win, like something that I still don’t benefit from \nbecause I can marry all I want, I can fall in love tomorrow and say, let's get \nmarried, and even if he was a citizen, I would still not benefit from him because \nof the immigration laws. And if he wasn’t, nothing assures me that our marriage is \ngoing to be there because any day I could get deported. Any day I could be taken \naway. And then you have the Executive Order of ENDA, that's a win for the gay \ncommunity. Like, that's a win for discrimination, but that's not a win for me or my \ncommunity because tomorrow we can wake up, DACA ends and we have no job. \nDiscrimination or not in the workplace, it’s not going to happen because we won’t \nbe in the workplace. And that's minimal to the reality that we’re facing. You are \ncelebrating these wins that are not wins for the whole community that you're \nclaiming to represent. \n  \n \t\r  102 \nJulio shared a similar sentiment. \nAnd also you know, marriage is something, but it's something that is not really \nconcerning me now. Something concerning me now is getting a legal status so \nthat I don't have to fear for myself, being sent back to a country where you know \npeople are not as open-minded or as accepting. These are the things that I struggle \nwith day-to-day. \nJulio described discourses around marriage as a privilege that he was unable to celebrate \ngiven the salience of his undocumented status on his every day life. The ability to get \nmarried did not relieve the ongoing criminalization of his undocumented community nor \nabsolve the fear of deportation imposed by his immigration status. Mainstream LGBTQ \nadvocacy work, hence, did not speak to his experience holistically, and reduced the \ncomplexity of his undocuqueer identity to just LGBTQ. \nFor Patricia, creating undocuqueer spaces meant refusing to assimilate into a \nselectively homonormative social movement that does not address her intersectional \nexperience. She, among other participants, highlighted the value of undocuqueer as \ndeveloping a space of belonging. It signified resisting the impulse to compromise an \naspect of her identity for the sake of embracing another. \nI feel that within undocuqueerness, we need to have our own space. We don't \nneed to necessarily fall into any organization or rhetoric about what it means to be \nqueer. Just for example, I go to pride events, but I acknowledge that pride really \njust talks about White males, you know. So it's like knowing that whatever space \nhas been there before in terms of identity, that you don't necessarily have to go \ninto it. You can just create your own space.  \n \t\r  103 \nThe mutual exclusivity of LGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks compelled \nparticipants to embrace the complexity of their undocuqueer identities, and develop their \nown public narrative outside of LGBTQ and immigrant rights discourses. Creating their \nown spaces, undocuqueers challenged the consistent erasure of their experiences at the \noverlapping margins of two single-variable identity-based social movements. It was a \nway of blurring and deconstructing group boundaries, while simultaneously building \nbridges across movements. \nDREAMer. Identifying as undocuqueer also represented a shift away from the \nDREAMer narrative. While all participants in this study identified as undocuqueer, only a \nfew of them who met the eligibility criteria simultaneously identified as DREAMers. \nParticipants described how identifying as a DREAMer was their doorway into activism. \nDREAMer as an identity was better than “illegal,” when they began to advocate for the \npassage of the DREAM Act. Over time, however, their politization and critique of the \nsystems in place incited them to identify instead with a more complex identity moniker \nreflective of their lived experiences—undocuqueer.  \nMark, for example, reflected on his shift from identifying as a DREAMer earlier \nduring his involvement in the immigrant rights movement, to now identifying as \nundocuqueer. For Mark, adopting an undocuqueer identity complicated the conversation \naround immigrant rights, and more directly spoke to his experience at the intersection of \nsexuality and immigration status. \nEn algún momento si me identifique con el término DREAMer, pero pienso que \nhoy en día no me identifico como DREAMer. Más que nada si me identifico \ncomo undocuqueer porque pienso que DREAMer es una palabra más \n \t\r  104 \ngeneralizada. It's a lot more broad, whereas undocuqueer is very direct and really \nspeaks about my two identities. \nAt one point, I did identify with the term DREAMer, but I think that nowadays I \ndon’t identify as a DREAMer. More than anything, I do identify as undocuqueer \nbecause I think that DREAMer is a very broad word. It's a lot more broad, \nwhereas undocuqueer is very direct and really speaks about my two identities. \nMark described how DREAMer simplified his identity, and did not necessarily capture \nthe ways his sexuality implicated his everyday life as an undocumented immigrant. The \nDREAMer identity was incomplete and did not accurately reflect the complexity of his \nlived experience. For this reason, he opted for a more complex self-definition reflective \nof his everyday struggle. \nPatricia similarly described how the “good immigrant” student identity purported \nby the DREAMer narrative did not account for other salient facets of her identity that \nwere deemed less desirable by normalized American ideals. For example, working under \nthe table and being LGBTQ. \nI remember being in 2010, and I was like, oh why are we only claiming the \nstudent identity when, you know, we are also working? Like a lot of us are \nworkers, we are under the table, so why don't we claim that we-are-making-the-\neconomy-run identity? Or why are we not claiming this I-am-LGBTQ identity? \nSo I just saw that when I came into the movement in 2010, I felt like it was still \nvery young... I felt that a lot of people, including myself, saw how following a \ntalking point or just claiming one identity or framing the “good immigrant” versus \n \t\r  105 \nthe “bad immigrant” wasn't something that we should be doing just because of the \nfact that it was still affecting our community in so many levels. \nFor Patricia, immigrant rights went well beyond just the student identity. She described \nrecognizing the diversity of experiences within her immigrant community, and how \npositioning DREAMers as somehow more worthy of a pathway to citizenship \nsimultaneously defined who was not. The politics of deservingness, as influenced by \nAmerican ideals, hence, continued the perpetual criminalization of undocumented \nimmigrants, and punished non-DREAMer archetypes. \nBy opting for a more complex intersectional identity, participants also resisted the \nDREAMer narrative’s portrayal of undocumented immigrants as normal people, \naccording to American ideals. Joe, for example, discussed how the DREAMer narrative \ninvoked certain assumptions about what it means to be a normal American, and how that \nnarrative in the current context did not include identifying as LGBTQ. \nIf you watch the President, as a prime example, in his speeches when he talks \nabout undocumented immigrants and DREAMers, there is a very clear message \nthat is being portrayed, and like I talked about earlier, it is very heteronormative \nand you hear these ideas of, these are people that just want to be American they \nare just like us. It's a very normative kind of saying. It's like saying they are \nnormal too. I think what undocuqueer does, it's a critique of the normal saying \nthat…you’re portraying undocumented people as just normal people. But \nundocuqueer is saying, well actually, no. Let's critique that because that is coming \nfrom a place of like heteronormativity and only further perpetuates oppression in \n \t\r  106 \nevery day because it takes people out of being not normal to normal, but it does \nnothing to critique why we think people are not normal in the first place. \nBecause DREAMers are positioned in the backdrop of the default American profile (i.e., \ncis-gender and heterosexual), Joe felt further displaced as a queer man who did not nicely \nconform to that archetype. Undocuqueer, hence, meant having to create his own space, \napart from DREAMers, in order to feel empowered as an LGBTQ-identified \nundocumented immigrant.  \nJulio shared a similar sentiment and discussed how the DREAMer identity did not \nquite speak to his experience.  \nLike some of us would say, I am not your typical DREAMer. The typical \nDREAMer, the one portrayed on TV. Unfortunately, mostly always the \nDREAMer that always excelled in class, always did extra credit, always was the \nteacher's pet, always did anything and everything they could to get an “A.” Like I \nmentioned, I was different. I was gay and I was going through a lot of issues when \nI was in high school.  \nBeyond the challenges imposed by his undocumented status (e.g., ID, license, college, \nfinancial aid, and family separation), which other undocumented youth could relate to, \nJulio was also confronted by the added pressures of being gay, which included coming \nout, coping with issues of family acceptance, bullying, harassment, and never really \nfeeling part of the DREAMer narrative. DREAMer, as an identity, did not fully capture \nthe nuances of his multiply-marginalized experience. \n \t\r  107 \nJesse similarly described the way being LGBTQ automatically positioned him \noutside of the “good immigrant” narrative. His critique of the DREAMer narrative was \nthat it was hierarchal and not inclusive of non-student identities. \nAnd I think as undocuqueers now, that's why most of us push back on the \nnarrative of “good DREAMer” versus “bad DREAMer”, or “good immigrant” \nversus “bad immigrant” because if you are to analyze it and write it down, all \nundocuqueers fall either one way or another as a “bad immigrant”, however you \nwant to write it. The fact that you love the same sex you are bad. \nJesse described how the sociopolitical context of the U.S. framed discourses around \nnormativity, and how those discourses, unfortunately, did not include LGBTQ identities, \ngiven their perceived deviance from heterosexuality. Challenging these simplified \nconceptions of deservingness, participants opted for more complex self-definitions \noutside of the DREAMer narrative that better conveyed their positionality amidst anti-\nimmigrant, xenophobic and heterosexist power structures simultaneously. \nResilience: When Thriving is (Im)Possible \n  Resisting heteronormativity, homonormativity and the DREAMer narrative, \nwhile simultaneously living within the vulnerable state of illegibility, participants \ndescribed undocuqueer as resilience. Undocuqueer was a symbol of survival and a self-\ndefinition that enabled participants to resist normative discourses that tried to capture \ntheir experiences within categories they did not entirely fit in. Heteronormative, \nhomonormative and DREAMer spaces provided the context by which undocuqueers \nassigned meaning to their experiences, and developed strategies for interacting and \nworking within interlocking systems of oppression. As Mario described, \n \t\r  108 \nI think that throughout our movement, the thing that connects us together for the \nundocumented youth movement and the LGBT community is that piece of feeling \nstuck. Not being able to progress, like something is holding you back, and then \npushing through it. Regardless of what is holding you back, you find a way to \nsurvive. You find a way to progress throughout all the obstacles, and I think that \nshows extraordinary resilience in our community. And that is the same type of \nresilience that many members of our LGBTQ community, whether they are \nundocumented, face too. So that is probably the factor that allows me to express \nto both communities our mutual connections and struggle. But also what we can \nlook forward to win, a mutual liberation through our resilience and coming \ntogether in community. \nMario highlighted how the sociopolitical context of the U.S. inflicted many barriers and \nlimitations based on his sexuality and immigration status. The simultaneity of this \nmarginalization allowed him to better communicate with both the LGBTQ and immigrant \ncommunities, based on their shared resilience. Learning to cope through unjust systems \nthat simultaneously targeted his LGBTQ and undocumented experience, Mario described \nresilience as the common denominator that helped bridge both movements together. \nMaria similarly described undocuqueer as resilience. For her, undocuqueer \ninvolved strategically navigating the tangible and intangible limitations of being LGBTQ \nand undocumented simultaneously.  \nI mean, I have an incredible amount of resilience and I think maturity as well. \nBeing undocuqueer makes you grow up pretty quickly because you have to \nconfront different parts of your reality at a young age in order to like make things \n \t\r  109 \nhappen in your life. So yes, resilience. I am very—I don't know how to say it—I \nam very shrewd. I think I have been living my life always trying to strategize to \ndo everything that I wanted to do. Pretty much, like go to college, go on dates \nwith women. Like I had to create all these little tricks and ways to get what I want \nall the time… \nMaria described resilience as a survival mechanism she was forced to develop in order to \nnavigate the spaces of impossibility generated by her social nonexistence. She described \ncreating tricks to circumvent the social conditions of her LGBTQ and undocumented \nidentity, and how these tricks enabled her to sidestep the limitations she experienced and \nthe displacement she incurred being denied of legal personhood and civil rights otherwise \nafforded to documented heterosexual. \nJosh described how the intersection of his multiply-marginalized identities not \nonly incurred consequences for how he was impacted socially, but also how he \nphysically, emotionally and psychologically responded to his subjugation, and learned to \ncope within these conditions.  \nI feel like if anything, that is what undocuqueer resembles. It is like a \npsychological battle, a spiritual psychological battle of trying to define a \ncondition, an identity that is marginalized all the time, structurally and everything. \nYeah, I am surprised people don't go bananas because it is a lot of pressure. If you \nthink about it, dude this is fucked up. But there is always that resilience and that \nhope that we are striving to make things a little better. \n \t\r  110 \nJosh recognized the formidability of living at the overlapping margins of two social \nidentities that were marginalized all the time. He described his experience as a process of \ncoping with social pressures, and learning to survive.  \nBut at the same time it definitely helped me build tough skin. Like, dude this is \ngoing to be the rest of my life that people are going to call me all kinds of names \nforever so I might as well, you know, focus on what I want to do and make it \nhappen and prove them wrong. I think that is what definitely helped me come into \nthat. Because it's hard. Now I am like, oh whatever being queer being \nundocumented is whatever to me, it's whatever, I don't really care about it. But I \ndo acknowledge that it is hard, like the social pressures of identity, and the social \npressures of not fitting in any of those molds, the social pressures of all that can \nreally get to a person. It can really be very damaging.  \nUndocuqueer as resilience, for Josh, meant thriving even when the conditions made it \nimpossible to do so. It represented learning to interact and work within the unique \nchallenges of being multiply-marginalized by the intersection of gender \n(nonconformance), sexuality and immigration status.  \nSubjected to multiple forms of oppression, participants described their means of \nsurvival amidst the consequences of family rejection, employment discrimination, and \ntheir ineligibility for rights, resources and protections otherwise afforded to documented \nheterosexuals. Participants who lacked familial support often encountered the added \nburden of being kicked out of their homes, and were often driven to the margins of the \ninformal economy. Coming to their self-definitions, even within conditions of \n \t\r  111 \n(im)possibility, was indicative of the resilience they ascribed to living within the \noverlapping margins of gender, sexuality and immigration status.  \nSurviving societal rejection. Prior to the passage of DACA, there were \nabsolutely no opportunities for undocumented immigrants to gain lawful employment. \nSeveral participants described creating their own opportunities to make money in order to \nsupport their families and sustain their living. Alex, for example, shared how his \nundocumented status forced him to consider alternative outlets for employment that were \nexploitative of his sexuality.  \nI was a sex worker for a while, when I was like in high school. So yeah definitely \nbeing undocumented and not being able to work, and being queer opened up this \nidea in my head at a young age that I cannot work and I’m queer so like, what else \ndo I have? \nAlex shared the sense of desperation he felt trying to earn a living amidst the social \nlimitations imposed by his undocumented status. Sex work, as a form of survival, was \nparticularly prevalent amongst trans participants, who also shared how their opportunities \nfor employment were further restricted as a result of their gender identity and expression. \nNot everyone offered transgender immigrants the same opportunities for employment as \ncisgender immigrants. Josefina, a 41-year-old transmujer from New York, for example, \ndescribed the ways that employment discrimination pushed undocumented transmujeres \nto the streets, given the compounded difficulties in finding work. \nY por no tener papeles, tenemos la necesidad de hacer el trabajo sexual. Y del \ntrabajo sexual, la policía nos arresta por andar, pero yo creo que nosotros no \nhacemos mal porque si no tenemos trabajo, nosotros tenemos, nosotros tenemos \n \t\r  112 \nque pagar renta, nosotros tenemos que pagar biles. A lo mejor tenemos papas, tíos \nque tenemos que mandarles dinero a nuestros países, pero de donde les vamos a \nmandar  si no tenemos ningún trabajo? Ninguna entrada de economía, entonces \nque es lo que tenemos que hacer? Buscar el medio de cómo solventar nuestros \ngastos. \nFor not having papers, we have the necessity to do sex work. And from doing sex \nwork, the police arrests us, but I don’t think we are doing something bad because \nif we don’t have work, we need to pay rent, we need to pay bills, and maybe we \nhave parents or uncles whom we need to send money to in our home countries, \nbut how are we going to send them money if we don’t have any work? We have no \nincome coming in, so what are we going to do? We find a way to earn a living. \nEmployment discrimination was not only apparent for individuals without legal \nauthorization to work in the U.S., but was also evident for participants who did not nicely \nconform to normative conceptions of gender identity and gender expression. Josefina \ndescribed often not being given the opportunity to work within the formal economy as a \nresult of her undocumented status and/or perceived gender expression. As a result, she \ndescribed turning to survival sex in order to sustain her living. Trading sex for money \nmade her increasingly susceptible to policing and arrest, but she described having no \nother options for employment, given the susceptibility of her undocumented status, \ngender identity and gender expression. Being positioned at the intersection of gender \nidentity, sexuality and immigration status meant learning to cope with and survive within \nthe amalgam of being treated as criminals or deviants, and being able to eat. \n \t\r  113 \n Bianca similarly described turning to survival sex during her transition as a \ntransmujer. Arriving to the U.S. as an unaccompanied minor after being kicked out of her \nhome for coming out as LGBTQ, Bianca described survival sex as her means to financing \nher transition while simultaneously navigating the limitations of finding employment as \nan undocumented immigrant. \nSe puede decir que emigre a los Estados Unidos y llegue aquí sola. Y como todas \nlas personas, no tenia definida realmente mi sexualidad. En ese entonces me \nidentificaba como un chico gay todavía. Después de estar casi 5 anos de estando \naquí en New York City, decidí empezar mi transición, eso fue lo que yo hice. \nEmpecé con mi transición y después empecé a tomar hormonas, pastillas y todo. \nDespués yo estuve trabajando en la calle por, se puede decir trabajo sexual por \nmas de dos anos. \nI guess you can say I migrated to the U.S., and I came by myself. And like \neveryone else, I didn’t yet have my sexuality well defined. At that time, I identified \nas a gay boy. After living here in New York City for almost 5 years, I decided to \ncommence my transition, that’s what I did. I started my transition and afterwards \nI started to take hormones, pills and everything. Afterwards, I started working in \nthe streets. You can say I did sex work for more than two years. \nBianca highlighted the ways performing sex work as a means of survival enabled her to \nsustain her living and simultaneously finance her transition. Utilizing her trans identity, \nBianca was able to create work for herself and mitigate the economic limitations imposed \nby her undocumented status. \n \t\r  114 \nBeyond issues of employment, trans participants also described access to \nhormones and medical care as an immediate concern. Josefina, for example, referenced \nthe intersectionality of her gender identity and undocumented status as inhibiting her \nfrom being able to obtain hormones via medical prescription. Given disparities in \nemployment and the lack of access to health resources, she described relying on the black \nmarket, as opposed to physicians and healthcare services, for her transitioning needs. \n...como no tenemos Medicaid, tenemos la necesidad de andar comprando \nhormonas en el mercado negro, y yo creo que si tuviéramos papeles, si tuviéramos \nMedicaid, no anduviéramos haciendo esas cosas, donde los doctores o es casi en \nhospitales donde podríamos ir a recurrir a las hormonas gratuitas. Ósea yo creo \nque todas las chicas que quieren hacerse un proceso así tuviéramos oportunidad \nde tener, de convertirnos, de hacernos una mujer total como queremos serlo.  \nSince we don’t have Medicaid, we have the need to purchase hormones from the \nblack market, and I think that if we had papers, if we had Medicaid, we wouldn’t \nbe doing those things. It would be with doctors and in hospitals where we would \nbe able to obtain hormones. I mean, I think all the girls that want to have a \nprocedure done should have the opportunity to have one, to transform ourselves \ninto the women we want to be.  \nJosefina described how the inaccessibility of healthcare forced her to rely on unlicensed \nhealth resources for her medically necessary treatments (e.g., hormone therapy). Without \naffordable health insurance coverage, she was forced to turn to the black market for her \ntransitioning needs.  \n \t\r  115 \nValery, a 19-year-old transgender woman, similarly described having to resort to \nalternative methods for obtaining hormones that were more accessible and affordable.  \nI have to smuggle them to get them. But I am getting them, just not through the \ndoctor. But like I said, again, I would love to have the prescription. To be the right \nhormones, you know, to get a check done to make sure everything is going good. \nThis is what the system is causing me to do.  \nTrans participants generally described many of the unique challenges transgender \nimmigrants face in accessing the resources and affordable health care they need. Living at \nthe intersection of multiply-marginalized communities, participants described turning to \nsex work and unlicensed health resources, which increasingly put their health and lives at \nrisk. These modes of survival further subjected participants to increased surveillance \nfrom the police and perpetuated their criminalization. Participants, thus, faced increased \nrisk of detention under dragnet policing and immigration enforcement policies that \ntargeted their gender identity and expression, sexuality and immigration status. \nSurviving familial rejection. Participants also described experiencing a period of \nhomelessness, often as a result of family rejection, where they had to learn to fend for \nthemselves. Bianca, for example, described migrating to the U.S. as an unaccompanied \nminor, after being kicked out of her home for coming out as LGBTQ. Her narrative \nhighlights how she managed to survive despite being homeless and exploited as a result \nof her sexuality. \nMe corrieron de la casa. No fue fácil para mi. Estuve casi como un mes \ndurmiendo en las calles de México. Viaje a Tijuana. Y ahí fue donde a mis 14 \naños empecé a vender mi cuerpo porque una persona me obligaba a hacer eso. So \n \t\r  116 \nno se como le hice. Junte dinero para llegar a los Estados Unidos. Porque sabia \nque los Estados Unidos era un lugar libre donde tu podías ser lo que tu eres, y te \naceptan tal como uno es.  \nI got kicked out of my house. It wasn’t easy. I spent about a month sleeping on the \nstreets of Mexico. I traveled to Tijuana. That’s where, at age 14, I began to sell \nmy body because an individual forced me to do so. So I don’t know how I did it. I \nsaved money to come to the U.S. because I knew that the U.S. was a free place \nwhere you could be whatever you wanted to be, and people would accept you for \nwho you are. \nBianca described how homelessness, for her, was closely tied with sex work and issues of \nfamily acceptance. After being kicked out of her house at the age of 14, she was coerced \ninto selling her body as a means of survival and a method of financing her migration to \nthe U.S. Engaging in sex work was resultant of her experience navigating issues of \nhomelessness as an unaccompanied minor. \nEster similarly described how her perceived gender nonconformance and sexual \norientation not only subjected her to abuse, but also abandonment. Ester was similarly \nrejected by her family as a result of her perceived non-conformance to prescribed gender \nroles and expectations. \nSo at the age of 15, my sister outed me to my father, which preempted another \nbeating, but this time the most severe of all beatings I ever underwent through my \nfather. As he beat me up, he knew what my sexual orientation was and I \ncontinued for the first time to answer very honest to him that I was different. Not \npleased with my answer, my parents decided to leave me in Houston, and moved \n \t\r  117 \nto Miami. Leaving me alone, you know, confronting all the challenges of a high \nschool teenage student by myself. And by myself, I emphasize that, because I had \nto survive. I didn't have a place to stay, I had to work to live and work to eat, and \ntake AP classes and honors classes, and adopt a language and a culture that was \nvery foreign to me. And my English wasn't as solid as it is today, so that created a \nhuge challenge.  \nEster described having to work, while going to school, while simultaneously coping with \nfamilial rejection resultant from her perceived sexuality, gender identity and expression. \nFor Ester, losing familial support implied losing her home, which both directly and \nindirectly impacted the way she was able to navigate everyday responsibilities (e.g., \nwork, school).  \nHomelessness was an issue that disproportionately affected trans participants. \nValery, for example, similarly described her experience becoming homeless after coming \nout to her family first as gay, then later as trans.  \nI came out as a gay boy and my parents were not accepting about it. My mom, she \nis very oppressed by my dad, and my dad kicked me out of the house the same \nday, so I had to leave the house at the age of 16. I started working, and then I met \nthis one chick and she was trans. I had always just been like, oh I am gay. Very \nvery basic knowledge about LGBTQ until I started getting informed about sexual \norientation and gender identity, and the differences. That's when I was like, I feel \nmore into this. This is how I feel. This is how I identify myself more. That was \nanother coming out part when I started identifying not gay queer, but trans, \nbecause I honestly felt that I was not belonging. So eventually after a year, I was \n \t\r  118 \nat a family reunion and then I told my mom, hey I am not gay. And she was like, I \nam glad you changed your mind. I was like, yes I am trans. I tried to explain to \nher. My mom was a little bit more understanding of it, but then my family was \nnot. They just thought I was in a phase. I was just being crazy or something. Then \nword got to my dad. Then he completely told me that I cannot step in the house. I \naccepted that. I haven't talked to my dad in like two years. I have very little \ncommunication with my mom. \nHaving experienced the loss of familial support as a result of her LGBTQ identity, Valery \ndid not let her conditions impede the development of her trans identity. She continued to \nseek out information and develop her sense of self as a transwoman. Having strained her \nrelationship with her family, Valery described how family acceptance intersects with \nissues of homelessness and functions as an obstacle to participants’ commitment to \nsurvival. \nThe inaccessibility of housing and shelter represented another barrier. Restrictive \nstate policies that limited state public benefits to citizens and legal permanent residents \nprevented participants from accessing services they would have otherwise been eligible \nfor as LGBTQ citizens. Mario, for example, described running away from home after \nbeing outed by his sister. Not having recourse to public support, he was forced to \nunderstand his life and identity as tied to both the implications of his sexuality and \nimmigration status. \nI felt so ashamed that I would disappoint my mom that I ran away from home. I \nstopped going to school. I was homeless for about three months going from \nfriend’s place to friend’s place. Many times just sleeping outdoors. It was a rough \n \t\r  119 \nperiod of time for me. I didn't have any help. When I talk about homeless youth, \nparticularly homeless LGBT youth, the struggle for individuals who are both \nLGBT and undocumented is so severe because you can't even go to a shelter. You \nwill be turned away from a shelter if you don't have pieces of information that you \ncannot give them. So that is what was going on with me. \nMario described running away from home out of fear of family rejection. Unable to turn \nto LGBTQ public services as a result of his undocumented status, Mario described \nfeeling rejected as a result of both his sexuality and immigration status.  He utilized \nfriends and personal networks to navigate the period of homelessness he experienced.  \nThe fear of family rejection was common amongst participants who recognized \nthe important role that family (both chosen and biological) played in their life. Family \noften represented participants’ only means of support, given the lack of opportunities \nafforded to them as a result of their undocumented status. Jesse, for example, who came \nout to his family at the age of 19, described the prospect of family rejection, and what \nthat meant for him as an undocuqueer man in terms of survival.  \nLike our trans sisters who do sex work, people see that as bad, but they do not \nunderstand. And for me that is why I keep in mind, like even beyond our trans \nsisters, me as a gay boy, if I did not have the family that I have, and I would have \nbeen kicked out at the age of 19 in Arizona, like I don't know where I would have \nbeen now because I feel like at that moment I did not have friends to call and say, \nI am undocumented and I am gay and I just got kicked out of my house, I can't \nwork. Or that I knew somebody. I think my destiny would have been either sex \n \t\r  120 \nwork or death, like if my parents would not have accepted me or if they would \nhave kicked me out. \nParticipants, generally, recognized the interrelation of issues of family acceptance and \nhomelessness, as they pushed participants to the margins of the informal economy and \ncontributed to their perpetual criminalization. The social and legal repercussions attached \nto their gender (non-conformance), sexuality and immigration status forced participants \nto contemplate remaining in the closet and in the shadows simultaneously in order to \nmitigate the risks involved with coming out. \n  \n \t\r  121 \nSection 2: Interacting and Working Within \nThe meanings participants assigned to their experiences guided the ways they \ninteracted and worked within the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status. \nInterwoven throughout participants’ narratives was the notion of simultaneously needing \nto navigate their social positioning. Being undocuqueer required participants to evaluate \ntheir environments, and determine appropriate means for interacting and working within. \nAs Tommy stated, “it means being at the center of different identities, you trying to \nunderstand who you are, and other people perceiving you as a certain thing. I think it \nbecomes a constant trying to navigate between those things….” For this reason, \nparticipants described identity negotiation and coming out as strategies for navigating the \nintersection of LGBTQ and undocumented experience amidst anti-LGBTQ and anti-\nimmigrant sentiment. \nIdentity Negotiation \nIdentity negotiation referred to the outness of participants’ individual identities for \nthe purposes of safety, protection and/or visibility. Participants described concealing their \nLGBTQ and/or undocumented identities within different spaces in order to interact and \nwork within hetero/homonormative spaces that otherwise refuted their intersectional \ncomplexity. Mario’s narrative, for example, highlights the dilemma most participants \nattributed to simultaneously living in the closet and in the shadows.  \nI was coming to terms with my identity within a relationship, but also having to \nhide that component of my life was another shadow that I was living in because I \nwas hiding it in a way from my family, and in a way from society, and I was \n \t\r  122 \nhiding away with my family from society as being undocumented. So it was \nliving in both the closet and the shadow. That's how I grew up my whole life. \nAt home, family represented one of the biggest obstructions to coming out as LGBTQ, \nwhile in society it was the prospect of rejection, discrimination, and deportation that kept \nparticipants from coming out as LGBTQ and/or undocumented. As Mario shared, \nSo from a very early age, I knew I was different, I knew I was undocumented, but \nI did not know what that word meant. I also knew that I had to hide pieces of \nmyself—my identity—because people could use it against me or my family, and \nit would hurt them.  \nThe tangible and intangible limitations associated with being LGBTQ and undocumented \nled several participants to negotiate identity disclosure within certain contexts. \nParticipants unable or unwilling to dissemble their identities often faced the most severe \nconsequences.  \nCamilo described identity negotiation as an injurious experience he had \nconditioned himself to, as a result of bulling, harassment, and the fear of dire \nconsequences. He described deliberately suppressing his gender expression, and \ndisciplining his body to reflect more normative conceptions of masculinity in order to \navoid continuing to be harassed. \nMy gender expression had enabled me to completely go undetected and \ncompletely not targeted... And I'll say actually, not at the beginning of my life. If \nmy memory serves me correct, between the ages of five, I would say up until the \nfifth/ sixth grade, I was very much targeted for my gender expression. And then I \nthink that that led to a decision on my part. And I think that's the assimilation \n \t\r  123 \npatterns... I actually figured out a way to completely disassociate myself from that \ntargeting. I figured out a way to pass and to act and to completely control and \nregulate and monitor my gender expression. Until recently, I hadn't thought about \nhow tragic and unfortunate and just how completely heartbreaking that is. But I \ncompletely was able to monitor regulate and control to the tiniest degree my \ngender expression, such that from the sixth grade on, undetectable, undetectable \ncompletely. \nCamilo described learning to suppress, regulate and control his gender expression in \norder to allow his sexual orientation to go undetected. This self-disciplining of his body \ncreated the conditions for him to feel as if he had to perform certain rigid tropes of his \ngender in order to be perceived as normal. \nParticipants often described living in the closet and in the shadows as a survival \ntactic. Being out in certain spaces while not in others represented a survival mechanism \nand protective strategy. They discussed not sharing personal information or aspects of \ntheir LGBTQ and undocumented identities in effort to protect themselves and their \nfamilies from social targeting, family rejection, and the prospect of deportation. Identity \nnegotiation was a strategy they used to interact and work within the overlapping margins \nof LGBTQ and undocumented.  \nEster, for example, described concealing her undocumented status as a means of \nsurvival. She described how losing her family as a result of coming out as LGBTQ made \nher be more conforming of her undocumented identity, and the social conditions that her \nstatus subjected her to. \n \t\r  124 \nI just had a much more—how do you say that. I was more conforming of that \nidentity. Not disclosing that to anybody. Because of that identity and because that \nI was homeless, I often times ended up working cleaning bathrooms for three \ndollars an hour and I ended up working restaurant jobs that were very underpaid \nand full of labor rights violations. So I was not unwarranted to the repercussions \nand the oppressive systems that come from being an undocumented person, but I \nnever felt the need to fight back. I just internalized that as a reality because then, \neven if I was undocumented, I was living my dream of going to school, pursuing a \ncareer. \nFor Ester, concealing her undocumented identity allowed her to work and sustain her \nliving while simultaneously going to school.  Not having the support of her family, she \nunderstood how disclosing her status would implicate her life and make her increasingly \nsusceptible to being deported to a country far less tolerant of LGBTQ lives.  \nBecause immigration enforcement strategies at both the state and federal level \nreproduced the possibility and threat of deportation via apprehensions, raids, detentions, \nand deportations, participants’ vulnerability to the state, as constructed by anti-immigrant \nlaws, pushed them into the shadows as a protective strategy. Joe, for example, shared \nhow seeing his dad get deported influenced the concealment of his undocumented \nidentity.  \nBecause when [my dad] was deported, you know, you already saw one of your \nfamily members be directly impacted, and your family be directly impacted by \nthis, so it’s like even more, there is more, you know, of a case for keeping that \nlike in the closet. \n \t\r  125 \nJoe described identity dissemblance as a survival mechanism, an everyday strategy for \nprotecting himself and his family from harm. He described negotiating the outness of his \nundocumented status within different contexts in order to mitigate the risks of \ndeportation. \nThe prospect of societal acceptance through some type of immigration relief \nsimilarly influenced some participants’ choice to stay in the closet. Maria, for example, \ndescribed contemplating not coming out of the closet in order to retain her chances for \nlegalization through marriage. \nI feel like there was definitely some hesitancy in coming out at one point in my \nlife because I didn't want to cancel out my opportunities to getting a green card \nthrough marriage, which is fucked up but that's a real thing, you know. You \nknow, if you are openly out there and then you have a friend that comes along and \nwants to help you out, it’s like, well what are you going to do now? Immigration \nis going to look up your background and see that you are queer. And yeah, they'll \ngo on Facebook and see all my jota pictures. So that was a real thing because I \nwas like, I want a green card. So that was a very real thing. \nSeveral participants had contemplated marriage as a pathway to legalization at one point \nor another. That option kept several participants in the closet due to the inaccessibility of \nand stigma towards same-sex marriage in their states prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s \nruling for marriage equality. The possibility to resolve their immigration status pushed \nsome participants to subconsciously discipline their LGBTQ identities and subscribe to \nheteropatriarchal norms often inculcated by family.  \n \t\r  126 \nFelix, for example, described the ways in which being LGBTQ and \nundocumented influenced his decision to remain closeted for a large portion of his \nadolescent life.  \nWell, I was afraid of getting kicked out, and I was also—I mean that's the stuff \nabout being at the intersection of two identities, right. I thought well, if I get \nkicked out, I don't have an ID, I'm going to end up in a homeless shelter, they are \ngoing to reject me and I'm going to end up in the street. What am I going to do? \nThat is really what I was thinking about. And, you know, I felt like really hopeless \nbecause I couldn't get a job. I kept looking for jobs and it was really hard to get \njobs. You know people didn't want to give me jobs because I didn't have papers. \nSo, you know, I just felt like, well, I think this is not…I don't know, it just felt like \nI can't, I just can't do this. And I was really afraid. \nFear of family rejection, in addition to his material limitations as an undocumented \nimmigrant, influenced Felix’ decision to remain in the closet and not further complicate \nhis life. This decision constituted a survival tactic that participants often referenced in \nresponse to the multiple forms of oppression they already encountered as immigrants to \nthe U.S.  \nIt was the way my undocumented status…that I didn’t have the tools to protect \nmyself, because I depended on my family. And then I thought if they turned their \nbacks on me, then I’m fucked. As a queer person if I came out to them they would \nturn their backs on me, but as an undocumented person I didn’t have the tools to \nprotect myself because I couldn’t get a job, I can't get a license, you know I was \njust trapped. \n \t\r  127 \nFelix stressed the sense of interdependence within his family unit, and how that also \nposed a barrier to his ability to come out as LGBTQ at home. Coming out involved \nconstantly assessing the risks and weighing them against the benefits. It was about \nstrategically navigating the intersection of his (homo)sexuality and undocumented status. \nXavier, a 20-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, similarly described \ninteracting within the liminal state of being in and out of the closet. Given the prospect of \nfamily rejection and his ineligibility for public social services as a result of his \nundocumented status, he described his ambivalence coming out as LGBTQ. \nThis really just goes back to the fundamentals of you coming out. Like I said, you \nare not accepted. Second choice would be a homeless shelter. And because you're \nnot eligible for a homeless shelter, what's your third option? Me being hopefully \nat a friend’s house or some very generous person’s. After that, do you have a \nchoice? These are the implications for coming out as undocumented and gay… \nBut after that, really, you see a lot of prostitution. A lot of incarcerations, prison, \ndeath. To survive, or not to. \nFor Xavier, the prospect of family rejection meant homelessness, in addition to other \nconditions common amongst similarly situated individuals in his community: sex work, \nincarceration and suicide. Not qualifying for housing or shelter as a result of his \nundocumented status, he decided to remain in the closet in order to not create tension at \nhome or risk losing familial support.  \nEvery other facet of my life I am out, even at work, except my family. I even have \na Facebook that I don't use. I have a fakebook. So this is the one where I have six \nfriends, and they are all my family members. You would think it's smart, but it's \n \t\r  128 \nvery draining. It makes every other thing very apparent. The fact that you are \ncloseted, it's like I can say this here, but not there. \nBeing in the closet allowed Xavier to navigate certain aspects of his life more carefully \nuntil he was able to fully confront the consequences of coming out. The fear of losing \nimmediate support forced him, as well as other participants, to maintain their social and \nfamilial lives separate. \nSusana, a 25-year-old DACA recipient from Arizona, similarly described being \nout in certain spaces, but not quite out in other, like home. Given her already vulnerable \nstate as an undocumented immigrant, she described fear of family rejection as a reason \nfor maintaining her LGBTQ identity in the closet. \nPues el no ser abierta con mis padres. Decirles, ósea, que ellos lo sepan ya por \ncompleto que yo soy bisexual. Si a la vez me da mucho... tener que ser una \npersona con ciertas personas, al no serlo en mi casa…A veces pienso que algún \ndía de estos exploto y le digo a mi familia, pero ando viendo una forma correcta \npara decirles a ellos para que ya no me afecte tanto...porque a veces siento que \nsoy dos personas en una sola. Que en una soy yo misma, y en otra no lo soy, y \nquisiera seguir siendo yo misma en ambos lados para ya no estar escondida en un \nsolo lugar. \nWell, by not being open with my parents. Telling them, like, so they know that I \nam bisexual once and for all. It weighs heavily on me to have to be one person \nwith certain people, not being that at home…Sometimes I think that one of these \ndays I will explode and just tell my family, but I’m trying to figure out the correct \nway to tell them so that it does not affect me too bad…because sometimes I feel \n \t\r  129 \nthat I am two people in one body. In one I am myself, and in the other I am not, \nand I would like to continue being myself but in both places so that I don’t have to \nhide in any one place. \nSusana’s sense of closetedness within the sphere of home bifurcated her social identity as \na queer undocumented woman. She described the stress of having to be two different \npeople at once as draining, but necessary for upholding gendered, familial expectations \nthat, in turn, allowed her to retain familial support.  \nPrior to the passage of DACA, participants viewed themselves as more dependent \nof their familial networks, given their inability to obtain or sustain continuous \nemployment as a result of their undocumented status. They described the sense of \ninterdependence they shared with their families as one of their major impediments for \ncoming out as LGBTQ. Because family provided participants with an initial source of \nemotional and economic support that they often relied on to achieve their personal goals, \ncoming out as LGBTQ jeopardized the availability of that support and drew limitations \non its accessibility. Mario, who described running away from home out of fear of family \nrejection, for example, shared how part of the reconciliation process with his family \ninvolved having to push his (homo)sexuality back into the closet in order to regain their \nsupport. \nShe said the only way I could come back into our household was if I agreed to go \nto counseling with their priest. So I agreed, because at that point I was exhausted \nof running. And so I said, okay I will try to change. And that's what I told her, that \nwas our agreement. I was fortunate enough that my mom opened the doors back \nup for me, but from that point on it was a struggle for me to catch up in school \n \t\r  130 \nand graduate in time, and go through the psychological turmoil of going through \ncounseling and going through a period of time where individuals were just calling \nme a sinner, calling me wrong, telling you that it's a choice and that you have the \nopportunity to change, when I deep inside myself knew that I could not change. \nThis was just who I was. \nMario described identity negotiation as a necessary tactic for fulfilling familial \nexpectations. Mitigating the expression of his (homo)sexuality enabled him to \nsuccessfully navigate home culture without jeopardizing familial support. This was \nparticularly important to him, given how he relied on his family to help finance his \neducation. \n… it was very difficult because I had to pay out-of-state international student fees, \nso I had to do lots of work, and then I had to rely even more on my family, which \nmeant that I really just had to not talk about the things that really strained our \nrelationship. So my identity with my family was hidden for a very long time, and \nsuppressed.  \nSimilarly situated, Ester described making a similar negotiation when her family \nwelcomed her back into their lives, after previously rejecting her for identifying as \nLGBTQ.  \nThey didn't come to my graduation, and it ended with me graduating with a full \nscholarship to [a university], which I did not take the offer because throughout the \nsummer my family finally contacted me, apologized, and asked me to come back \nunder the condition that we would not discuss my sexuality at home or under any \ncircumstances, as a matter of fact.  So when I made it to Miami it was very clear \n \t\r  131 \nthat I missed them, and that my family plays an important role in my life. That \ncoming out was more than one-person process, but it was a process for my family \nas well… \nIn her narrative, Ester described the reconciliation process for her and her family as a \ncompromise. She compromised her outness at home and conceded to heteropatriarchal \nstandards, while her family, in turn, reopened the doors of their home to her. Recognizing \nthe important role that family played in her life, Ester choose to repress expressions of \nher sexuality and gender nonconformance at home in order to retain familial support. \nNavigating the liminal space of being out, but simultaneously not being out, hence, \nbecame essential for retaining familial presence and support in participants’ everyday \nlives. \nThe prospect of employment discrimination similarly forced participants to \nnegotiate the outness of their identities in order to navigate potential employment \nopportunities. This was particularly relevant for trans participants. Josefina, for example, \ndescribed being fired after being outed as a transmujer in the workplace. Because she \nwas undocumented, she felt helpless and with no recourse for filing a complaint. \nEntonces me botaron del restauran por el hecho que un compañero me toco \njugando, y me toco los senos, y pues fue y se lo conto al dueño. Y el dueño en ese \nmomento, pues a los dos días, hablo conmigo, que tomara un mes de descanso y \nque él me llamaría para que yo regresara al mes a seguir trabajando. Ya después \nde ese mes no me llamaron. Y después llegue a saber que me habían despedido \nsolamente por el hecho de mi expresión de género. \n \t\r  132 \nSo they fired me from the restaurant for the fact that a colleague touched me \nplaying around, and he touched my breasts, and well, he then went and told the \nowner. And the owner at that point, within two days, called me in and asked me to \ntake a month-long break and that he would call me back in a month so I could \ncontinue working. After a month, nobody called me. And later I came to find out \nthat I had been fired solely because of my gender expression. \nAs a result of this experience, she described having to conceal her trans identity in order \nto mitigate the risks of being denied employment as a result of her gender identity and \nexpression. \nÓsea, yo sabía que yo era una mujer indocumentada, pero también yo tenía que \nocultar mi identidad en medio de mis trabajos por no decir que yo era una mujer \ntransgenero porque pues no cualquiera les da trabajo a personas como nosotras. \nLike, I knew that I was an undocumented woman, but I also had to hide my \nidentity as a transwoman between jobs because not everyone gives work to \npersons like us. \nSantos similarly described having to conceal his LGBTQ identity in the \nworkplace, given non-existent employment protections for LGBTQ workers in Arizona.  \n…now that I have DACA, if I were to get a job at a company, I have to be very \ncareful whether I am out at my workplace or not because of the fear that it may \nhave a negative impact for being out in my workplace. \nFor Santos, DACA provided the ability to work legally in the U.S., but having this \nprivilege, he was forced to negotiate the outness of his (homo)sexuality in effort to \nmaximize his job opportunities and mitigate the risks of retaliation.  \n \t\r  133 \nXavier similarly described how the absence of federal LGBTQ protections forced \nhim to strategically discipline the outness of his sexual and gender identity in the \nworkplace, as being openly gay had a potentially detrimental impact on his ability to \nmaintain employment.  \nSo you have to think about it, and then the choices, maybe big choices. Oh I am \ngoing to work undocumented. I'm gay. I'm at work. Okay, I'm just going to keep \nquiet. That's my first choice. Then I made the choice to talk to a girl about boys. \nSecond choice. You have to think about it because there's so much more at stake \nthan just like an income. This is my income. This is my livelihood. This is the \nmoney that I'm using towards my goal of going to school. This is towards a car. \nMaybe I will get a car, but I don't have a license. What if I work this hard for a car \nand then it’s taken away from me? I just wasted months of saving up to have my \ncar taken away from me. But I work here in Arizona, you can get fired for being \ngay! \nXavier described excising exceptional caution and self-control navigating the outness of \nhis social identities in the workplace. Being out in the workplace had consequences \nenforced by state policy (or the lack thereof) targeting his (homo)sexuality and \nimmigration status. \nComing Out \nBecause gender identity and expression, sexuality and immigration status were \ndisciplined by federal and state laws and policy, and resulted in tangible and intangible \nconsequences for undocuqueer immigrants, navigating the concept of coming out was \nincredibly relevant for participants in this study. The forced invisibility, exclusion, \n \t\r  134 \nsubjugation and repression of participants’ identities led participants to come out as \nLGBTQ, undocumented, and undocuqueer at different points, often to resist the powers \nof institutionalized oppression. Their coming out came to symbolize a form of resilience \namidst anti-immigrant, xenophobic and heterosexist power structures.  \nJulian, for example, described coming out to his parents as a form of release from \nthe stress and anxiety associated with the educational limitations imposed by his \nundocumented status, in addition to the daily pressures of having to suppress his LGBTQ \nidentity. \nThis was my senior year. And so it was really stressful and all my classes were \nrequirements to graduate. And so my second semester, two weeks prior to \ngraduation, I remember I was at a friend’s house having a sleepover, and out of \nnowhere I told my friends that I was going to tell my parents next week. They \nwere like, no don’t do it. What's going to happen? They were kind of scared of \nwhat was going to happen to me. I told them I had to do it, just because I was \ndealing with going to college. Well, I actually got into five schools, but of course \nI wasn’t able to pay for them. So I was like, what am I going to do? So I was like, \nI had to get something off my shoulders. And that was telling my parents that I \nwas gay.  \nElias similarly described coming out as a liberating experience that enabled him to \nrelease built-up stress imposed by the suppression of his gender expression and sexuality. \nI wasn’t happy with what I was doing. I was trying to be someone I wasn’t and I \nwas always trying to act super straight. I was hanging out with people and was \nbasically trying to act like a bad ass, but it wasn’t working for me. I was getting \n \t\r  135 \nreally depressed. I didn't want to do anything. It just didn’t feel right, so I decided \nto come out. \nFor participants, it was not until they decided to come out to others that they were able to \nchallenge the suppressive powers of heterosexism, and resist the temptation to succumb \nto more acceptable expressions of gender (non-conformance) and sexuality. \nJosh, who grew up in a predominately Latino neighborhood in California, \ndescribed coming out as a symbol of his resilience to the perpetual silencing of his \nLGBTQ and undocumented experiences. \nI’m small, so navigating this kind of life being perceived as this little feminine \nboy in this kind of like urban area and having to defend myself and fight people \nbecause they call me names, so it was a lot piled up when you're 16. And then, \nplus I don't have papers and I probably will never have papers, and that if I want \nto focus on my studies they are not going to pay me off because I cannot get a job \nwith my studies. So navigating all those social pressures at 16 when I discovered \npoetry, it really helped me process and come to peace with the fact that this is my \nidentity for the rest of my life and I would rather embrace it now or I am going to \nbe a really crippled human being. \nThrough poetry, Josh described learning to embrace his undocumented status, \n(homo)sexuality and interpretations of femininity in order to cope with/through \nenvironmental factors. He attributed his ability to embrace his undocuqueer identity to his \ninvolvement in activism. Activism, as a form of expression, served as an antidote to the \nsocial and political marginalization he faced as an undocuqueer immigrant. \n \t\r  136 \nMark similarly described how coming out as undocumented in support of a \npathway to citizenship helped him to also come out as LGBTQ. He attributed his ability \nto embrace his undocuqueer identity to the empowerment he derived from activism, \nwhich subsequently also enabled him to come out to his family. \nSi, pienso que para mí, eso fue lo que me ayudo. El activismo fue lo que en \nrealidad me ayudo a poder en realidad to fully embrace being undocumented and \nalso being queer and not be ashamed of either one of those identities. And after I \nwas able to embrace that, it’s after that that I was able to tell my parents, after that \nhad happened. \nYeah, I think that for me, that is what helped me. Activism was what really helped \nme to fully embrace being undocumented and also being queer and not be \nashamed of either one of those identities. And after I was able to embrace that, it's \nafter that that I was able to tell my parents, after that had happened. \nMark described how connecting with similarly situated others and forging a sense of \ncollective identity around their undocuqueer status enabled him to come out both to his \nfamily and society at large. Coming out marked his resistance to oppressive systems that \naimed to silence the expression of his LGBTQ and undocumented identities. Being out \nsymbolized his resilience amidst the institutionalized oppression. \nFor the majority of participants, the youth-led immigrant rights movement was \ntheir gateway into activism. They often attributed their ability to fully embrace their \nLGBTQ identity to the empowerment they developed as activists within the immigrant \nrights movement. As Jesse described, \n \t\r  137 \n… before that I was very oblivious because I didn't want to think about it. I didn't \nwant to think about me being undocumented so I pretended not to be, and I was \ngood at that, but the queer was like present. And in my mind I always thought \nthat, oh being undocumented is going to change. Like in 2010, I thought it was \ngoing to change because I was like, oh we are going to get the DREAM Act and \nit’s going to change. No one is ever going to find out that I was ever \nundocumented because I'm going to be able to do that. But in the other end, being \nqueer was never going to change. So that is what I had more trouble accepting and \nfiguring out, how to navigate what it meant within the spaces, until I got in the \nimmigrant movement where I was like, wow this plays a big role in my life, and a \nlot of the identity that I have is because I am undocumented. \nRejecting the fear, shame and invisibility inherent in their undocumented status, \nparticipants were similarly able to challenge internalized conceptions of (homo)sexuality \nas deviant and wrong, and reshape them. Their self-acceptance propelled identity \ndisclosure, and enabled them to demand greater inclusion within existing systems and \nstructures. The student identity was the catalyst for much of this activism.  \nBecause the majority of participants (22) had either graduated from, stopped out \nof or were currently enrolled at an institution of higher education, they also highlighted \nhow college and the college process influenced their ability to come out as both LGBTQ \nand undocumented, often for the first time. This was particularly true for DACA \nrecipients in my sample, as DACA recipients were overwhelmingly the only participants \nwith at least some level of college education. Maria, for example, described how coming \nout as undocumented to gain access to higher education empowered her to come out as \n \t\r  138 \nqueer, but not until she was able to surmount the barriers to higher education and feel \nsafe. She described how her community environment prior to college was prohibitive of \nher LGBTQ self-exploration. For this reason, she described concealing her \n(homo)sexuality until she was able to achieve more pertinent goals—safety.   \nEventually when I moved out of Florida and I moved out of my home, you know I \nwas accepted into [my institution], and this is one of the top LGBT friendly \nschools in the country, so I think being in that space allowed me to be safe enough \nto come out. And, I mean, also in Lakeland, where I live, when you organize \naround immigrant rights there, not even talking about queer issues I would get \nletters from the KKK and stuff. That's the kind of place we lived at. You know, \npeople are crazy. So I think safety was a big factor in me putting off coming out \nuntil very recently. \nMaria described how her environment at an LGBTQ-friendly institution played a big role \nin her decision to come out. Prior to college, she described not feeling safe enough to \nexplore her sexual identity because her environment required that she focus on her \nsurvival as an undocumented immigrant.  \nGrowing up, I think I always understood that I liked women, and I was interested \nin men from time to time, but I think I really wanted to do everything within my \npower to not complicate my life. I was already living in this pretty conservative \ntown where it wasn't even okay to be Latino, very much less being \nundocumented. And I think because I have been in survival mode for a very long \ntime, thinking about even romantic relationships in the first place even with men \n \t\r  139 \nor with women or whomever, it just wasn't something that I was setting as a \npriority. \nGiven concerns for daily survival inflicted by her undocumented status, Maria described \ndelaying sexual identity exploration until she felt safe enough to really engage those \naspects of her core self. Choosing to not complicate her life more than she needed to, \ncollege provided an opportunity for her to confront suppressed facets of her undocuqueer \nidentity, and come out. \nFor Xavier, college similarly represented an opportunity to explore his \n(homo)sexuality away from the confining constraints of home. Unfortunately, due to state \npolicy that disqualified him from in-state tuition and state-based financial aid (i.e., AZ \nProposition 300), he was unable to pursue a college education. He attributed his inability \nto come out to his family as LGBTQ to the inaccessibility of higher education for \nundocumented students in his state. \nIt's not that I'm scared of them knowing, because I'm pretty self-sufficient. It's just \nback then, if my family were to have known and had they not accepted me, I \nwould not know what my plan would have been, since my plan B was going to \ncollege. \nXavier recognized that if he had the same opportunities as his citizen peers to go to \ncollege based solely on merit, he would not feel as trapped within the closet of his home. \nCollege represented an opportunity to come out of the closet. Being stripped of access to \nhigher education, however, effectively removed the possibilities of escaping, and forced \nparticipants like Xavier to confront the limitations of their immigration status on their \nsexual identities. \n \t\r  140 \nTommy similarly described being unable to even consider the possibility of \ncoming out as LGBTQ until he got to college. He described being so entrenched by the \nsalience of his undocumented status that he was unable to explore his sexuality until he \nwas admitted into college and introduced to safe spaces on campus. \nI think about this now, kind of in retrospect, I know now that my priorities were to \npursue an education and it seemed like my identity, my queer identity was not at \nthe top of that list. So it wasn't something like where I personally felt like I had to \nforce it. It was just not a priority. I didn't address it because I had other things to \nthink about. So I feel like that's something that happens, especially because I have \na chance to work with youth now that I see. I guess it just doesn't have a priority \noutside of like personal identity. And it creates these really negative feelings that I \nthink for me at that time I remember having different priorities and once I really \nhad the capacity or the time to be like, okay, I really want to figure this out, figure \nthis part of myself, I want to start figuring it out, that's when I was finally able to \ncome out. And because I was introduced to spaces that were a welcoming space \nfor people to come out, which I had not had in the past. Not so directly. \nGiven the imposed barriers to access to higher education, Tommy viewed his sexuality as \na commodity nowhere near as salient as his undocumented status. Education was \nparticularly important to him, given his parents’ sacrifice: migrating to U.S. in pursuit of \nthe American dream for their children. His parents had always prioritized Tommy’s \neducation. For this reason, Tommy described not disclosing his (homo)sexuality until \ncollege, when the barriers to higher education as predicated by his undocumented status \nhad become surmountable.  \n \t\r  141 \nMark shared a similar sentiment. Because he recognized the barriers to higher \neducation and financial aid as an undocumented student, he described focusing on the \nsalience of his undocumented status and suppressing his (homo)sexuality until getting to \ncollege. He, too, viewed the implications of coming out as LGBTQ as potential inhibitors \nto his academic trajectory. \n… estaba muy enfocado en la escuela, y en realidad quería ir a la universidad, y \npienso que si me hubiera distraído no hubiera podido agarrar becas o ver hecho \ntan bien en la escuela. Fue lo que me ayudo a poder ir a la universidad después de \nla high school, a una universidad de cuatro años. Porque yo miraba que muchas \npersonas que estaban en mi situación se iban a colegios comunitarios por lo del \ndinero, porque no podían pagarla. Y  yo estaba en la misma situación, y de alguna \nmanera no quería distraerme, y quería enfocarme más en mí mismo, en mi \neducación. Además, yo estaba batallando también mucho con el Ingles, y pues fue \nuna manera para mi, no se no quería distracciones. Quería enfocarme en mi \ncarrera. En mi mismo. \n… I was very focused on school, and in reality I really wanted to go to the \nuniversity, and I think that had I been distracted, I would not have been able to \nobtain scholarships or perform as well in school. That’s what helped me go to a \nuniversity straight out of high school—a four-year university. Because I would see \nmany similarly situated individuals go to community college because of the \nmoney, because they could not afford it. And I was in the same situation, so I did \nnot want to get distracted. I wanted to focus on myself, and my education. Plus, I \n \t\r  142 \nwas struggling a lot with English, so it was also a way for me, I don’t know, I did \nnot want to be distracted. I wanted to focus on my career. On myself. \nBecause he was already challenged by the inaccessibility and unaffordability of a college \neducation, Mark regarded his (homo)sexuality as an additional challenge that could deter \nhim from being able to achieve access to a four-year public institution of higher \neducation. For this reason, he decided to forestall exploring his (homo)sexuality until he \ngot to college, when the salience of his undocumented status became less weighty. \nEstablishing a healthy LGBTQ identity, hence, was often regarded as a commodity, given \nparticipants’ perception that being out as LGBTQ complicated their ability to interact and \nwork within the limitations imposed by their immigration status. \nBridging Communities through Education \nFor participants, familial interdependence at home represented one of the biggest \nobstructions to coming out as LGBTQ, while in society it was the prospect of rejection, \ndiscrimination, detention and deportation that kept participants from coming out both as \nLGBTQ and undocumented. Coming out, hence, came to signify engaging their LGBTQ \nand immigrant communities in coalition building via the sharing of their stories. For \nJesse, for example, education was essential both in and outside of the home. It was about \nhelping his community understand the perspectives of undocuqueer lives, while \nsimultaneously addressing issues of silence at home. \n‘What does being queer have to do with you being immigrant? Like, why’d you \nhave to tell them? Like, it is already bad that you are telling them that you are \nundocumented, why is it that you have to drop that you are gay there too?’ And \n[my parents] would hate it, and I think I would challenge them by sharing this and \n \t\r  143 \nshowing them stuff. So it was like even in those spaces with the people that I was \ntrying to convince on why it was important, it was that even when I went home, \neven my own parents who are my parents didn’t see why it was important to have \nboth identities or to call out both identities. So it's really hard when you are \norganizing at home and organizing out, and when you organize out and then you \ncome home and you can't organize because you love the people and you don’t \nwant to like push it. That it’s like, why are you really organizing? So that’s when I \nwas like, well if I am organizing over there I need to start from home. \nThe inherent sense of shame around (homo)sexuality and undocumented status within his \nown family was an impediment to the liberation Jesse sought. Doing work in the \ncommunity while neglecting the sense of oppression often experienced at home was not a \nsystematic approach toward dismantling heterosexism and internalized “illegality.” For \nthis reason, Jesse described undocuqueer as having a responsibility to the education of his \nfamily and community. \nRamon, a 23-year-old DACA recipient from Washington, shared a similar \nsentiment.  \nAs an immigrant, on a personal note, I feel like it also has an added sense of \neducation within my own family, especially after coming out. And not only within \nmy family, but really within the scope of my immigrant community and the \npeople we work with so closely. So, again, at least for me in the capacities that \nI've been affected, there is just an added need to educate my community about \nLGBTQ issues.  \n \t\r  144 \nInforming his family and community about LGBTQ issues was particularly important \ndue to the prospect of rejection. Family rejection as a result of coming out as LGBTQ \nwas a common experience among participants. For some, rejection implied silence or \ndiscomfort around conversations regarding (homo)sexuality; while for others, rejection \nmeant homelessness. Ramon described sharing the responsibility of making immigrant \nspaces safe enough for families to ask questions, and for others to come out. \nThere has been some resistance, right, in terms of when we are talking about \nqueer issues when we are trying to fight for immigrant rights. I have had a couple \nof those conversations where somebody tells me like, why are we talking about \nthis? And my response has always been, well, like, we are also affected by this \nissue and just like you, there is more than one identity that is affected by \nimmigration status, which is partly why you have to be aware of these things. And \nI feel like, because your sexual orientation has been really private to some people, \nas advocates, we have to make it okay, we have to make it safe for other people to \ncome out, right. \nParticipants often described education as a commodity for a lot of their parents. \nGiven their on-going struggle to fulfill their basic needs (i.e., food, housing, safety), \nparents were described as often not having the opportunity to learn about things not \npertinent to their daily survival. These things often included perspectives outside of their \nown struggles. As Josh explained, \nI tend to be a little more, not forgiving, but understanding of their own \nhomophobia. I kind of, like, understand the cultural context of the homophobia in \nthem not as a direct blatant attack on who I am, but more of, like, an ignorance of \n \t\r  145 \nnot understanding or like being the first one to be presented with that. So that’s \nwhy. And also understanding as oppressed people, as people that are on the \nground, on survival mode, a lot of time we do not have the luxury to critically \nanalyze our behaviors. And my family, they say things too, but at the end of the \nday I know that they love me not because they embrace and understand \neverything that I am, but because they have always been there and they have \nalways been your family.  \nThe ability to invest time to learn about issues of irrelevance to their daily survival was a \nluxury that parents often did not have. As heads of their households, parents were often \ncharged with putting food on the table, clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads. \nParticipants perceived demanding greater cultural competency at home regarding \nLGBTQ issues was unfair, given their parents lack of exposure to issues outside of their \nown. Hence, educating their families about the relevance of LGBTQ issues within \nimmigrant rights discourses meant meeting them where they were at, and allowing the \nprocess of family acceptance to take place over time.  \nBecause the value of education lied in promoting family acceptance, having \naccess to resources that better equipped them to educate themselves and their families as \nwell as their Spanish-speaking communities about sex, gender, and sexuality, in \nparticular, was invaluable. Participants described coming out to one’s family as a difficult \nprocess due to not having accessible vocabulary in Spanish. For several participants, not \nhaving the contextual and historical terminology to communicate queerness, sexuality \nand gender non-conformance in Spanish represented a major impediment to their work \n \t\r  146 \ntowards family acceptance. Jesse, for example, described his struggle finding the tools to \nbetter inform his family and Spanish-speaking community about his LGBTQ experience. \nI think it is in changing the minds and acceptance of people, of like trying to \nexplain everything in Spanish and not having the resources there…And more like \non the acceptance. Like I said, the family acceptance, the organizational \nacceptance, like for them to release these taboo ideas or myths that they have and \nmore like educating them, I think that is the bigger effect. It comes from like \nculture and tradition and trying to break that down and trying to find that stuff so I \ncan explain this to you in Spanish, so you could better understand, and not having \nthe resources or not having the education. I think that's one of the biggest impacts \nof being a queer man in an undocumented movement, as an immigrant. Trying to \nrearrange years and years of tradition and trying to do it for yourself and not \nhaving accessible resources to be like, here is a book or here's a thing. Here's what \nwe are going through. \nJesse recognized that informing his community about LGBTQ issues in a language they \nunderstood was pertinent to challenging cultural misunderstandings of (homo)sexuality. \nUnlearning homo/transphobia was a process that required time, and was best \naccompanied by Spanish-speaking resources. The accessibility of the language was \nequally important, as many of participants’ parents had low levels of exposure to \neducation. Not having these resources readily available, participants described having to \ncreate their own resources. The resulting double coming out forums and family \nacceptance workshops enabled participants to engage their families, and create spaces \nthat facilitated their ability to successfully interact and work within issues of \n \t\r  147 \nhomo/transphobia, heterosexism and heteropatriarchy imposed by the intersection of \ngender identity and expression, sexuality and immigration status. \n \n \n  \n \t\r  148 \nCHAPTER 5: Discussion, Implications and Conclusion \nThis study revealed how theoretical borderlands (Abes 2009, 2012) are necessary \nto better understand LGBTQ undocumented activists’ meaning-making of the \nintersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience. Undocuqueer, as an identity, \nis deeply social and produced through and by participants’ ecological surroundings. For \nthis reason, a constructivist approach to Queer Intersectionality was used to facilitate the \nexploration of lived experience, and interrogate the privileges of citizenship and \nheterosexuality around the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status. \nIntersectionality alone can downplay the oppression that exists in society by failing to \ndeconstruct it. Queer Theory alone can overshadows participants’ lived experiences. \nQueer Intersectionality, taken together, however, reveals how participants come to \nperceive the intersection of their gender, sexuality and immigration status as existing \nwithin the current sociopolitical context encompassing the state of their nonexistence.  \nIn this study, Queer Intersectionality provided an analytic tool for deconstructing \nsimplistic ideas about subjectivity and political action based on the lived experiences and \nsubjectivities of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants. Because it recognizes the \ncomplexity and fluidity of experience, and the systems of power that produce it, Queer \nIntersectionality was used to (1) place the experiences of undocuqueer activists at the \ncenter of analysis; (2) explore the complexities of individual and collective identity; (3) \nreveal the ways interconnected domains of power organize and produce inequality and \noppression; and (4) analyze the ways undocuqueer activists resist the normalizing \ntendencies of organizations and institutions. Queer Intersectionality was framed in this \n \t\r  149 \nway to explore how the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status occurs \nfor undocuqueer activists across individual, interpersonal and social structural levels. \nFindings from this study revealed how participants ascribed three overarching \nself-meanings to the intersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience: \nVulnerability, Complexity, and Resilience. Recognizing their vulnerability within a state \nof illegibility (Anzaldúa, 1987), participants described a sense of exclusion within spaces \nof belonging, and wariness managing relationships with others; opting for more complex \nself-definitions, they resisted simplistic conceptions of identity that rendered their social \nlocations invisible (e.g., homonormativity, heteronormativity, DREAMer); and \ndescribing themselves as resilient, they described surviving societal as well as familial \nrejection even when surviving seemed impossible to do so. \nInteracting and working within the intersection of their LGBTQ and \nundocumented experience, participants also described the consistent theme of identity \nnegotiation. Participants utilized coming out as a form of resistance to institutionalized \noppression, and resilience amidst simultaneous anti-immigrant, xenophobic and \nheterosexist power structures. Participants learned to live in multiple worlds at the same \ntime and embrace the multiplicity of their undocuqueer identity while seeking to bridge \ntheir communities through stories, activism and peer education. The following section \nprovides a discussion of the findings in more detail. \nDiscussion \nPlacing gender, sexuality and immigration status at the center of analysis, this \nstudy positions undocuqueer as an alternative formation of identity that resists the \nnormative categorizations of LGBTQ and undocumented, and critiques dominant \n \t\r  150 \nLGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks simultaneously. Working against the \nconsistent erasure of their experiences at the overlapping margins of two single-variable \nidentity-based social movements, undocuqueers dissent from dominant \nconceptualizations of collective identity, and reveal the ways gender, sexuality and \nimmigration status are interconnected. Gender, sexuality and immigration status organize \nand produce inequality and oppression through state-sanctioned violence. The self-\nmeanings participants ascribed to living within the overlapping margins of gender, \nsexuality and immigration status were shaped by their specific sociopolitical locations, \nand were defined by the (1) vulnerability they felt, (2) the complexity they embodied, and \n(3) the resilience they demonstrate. \nThrough their narratives, participants described undocuqueer as being in a \nconstant state of vulnerability. Their vulnerability was imposed by the ways that they \nwere simultaneously targeted and made invisible by restrictive anti-LGBTQ and anti-\nimmigrant laws, policies and sentiment. The material consequences of being denied \naccess to rights, resources and protections had an impact on their ability to participate in \nLGBTQ social spaces, and navigate the inherent power differentials within interpersonal \nrelationships. Tommy, for example, recounted his vulnerability to rejection at an LGBTQ \nnightclub as a result of not being able to demonstrate a standard state-issued ID at the \ndoor, given his immigration status. For other participants, criminalization was the most \nblatant form of state-sponsored violence against LGBTQ undocumented immigrants. \nBianca, for example, described being vulnerable to employment discrimination for being \ntransgender, as well as labor rights violations for not speaking English and not having \npapers. Dragnet policing and immigration enforcement policies perpetuated participants’ \n \t\r  151 \ncriminalization, incarceration, and withdrawal of rights across different states, and \ncontributed to the deprivation of safety and security participants often felt devoid of. \nDue to the gendering of their experiences within the intersection of their LGBTQ \nand undocumented experience, participants inevitably also highlighted the salience of \ntheir gender identity and expression. Undocuqueer, as an identity, was constructed partly \nin response to the shared vulnerability participants experienced as targets of \ndiscrimination on the basis of their gender identity and expression, sexuality and \nimmigration status. It was also responsive to the invisibility they experienced as \nmarginalized members of LGBTQ and immigrant rights organizations. Jesse, for \nexample, described the ways in which his complexity was often deemed expendable by \nthe mainstream LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. Unable to be easily located \nwithin normalized acceptable identities and categories, undocuqueers came together and \ndeveloped their own self-definitions in order to reclaim their space within mainstream \nLGBTQ and immigrant spaces. This process of developing a third space (Anzaldúa, \n1987) involved contesting and renegotiating the boundaries of their LGBTQ and \nundocumented identities, in addition to their normative cultures. Umbrella terms, such as \nLGBTQ and undocumented, did not account for the ways that other factors mediated the \ncentrality of gender, sexuality and immigration status to their understanding of \nthemselves. For this reason, participants chose to identify with a more complex moniker \nreflective of their lived realities, and the intractable challenge of managing multiple \nidentities simultaneously. Mark, for example, described how adopting an undocuqueer \nidentity complicated the conversation around immigrant rights, and more directly spoke \nto his experience at the intersection of sexuality and immigration status. Undocuqueer, to \n \t\r  152 \nseveral participants, signified comprehensively addressing themselves, and no longer \nhaving to check any of their identities at the door. Redefining themselves as \nundocuqueer, participants resisted simplistic conceptions of their identities that reduced \ntheir experiences to unitary identity constructs, and essentialized their experiences in \naccordance with dominant power structures (e.g., homonormativity, heteronormativity, \nand citizenship).  \nThe self-definition participants partook in came to also symbolize their resilience \namidst structural and disciplinary systems of oppression. Heteronormative, \nhomonormative and DREAMer spaces provided the context by which undocuqueers \nassigned meaning to their experiences, and developed strategies for interacting and \nworking within interlocking systems of oppression. Valery, for example, described her \nmeans of survival amidst the consequences of family rejection, employment \ndiscrimination, and her ineligibility for rights, resources and protections otherwise \nafforded to documented, cisgender heterosexuals. Josh, similarly, described how the \nintersection of his multiply-marginalized identities not only incurred consequences for \nhow he was impacted socially, but also how he physically, emotionally and \npsychologically responded to his subjugation, and learned to cope within these \nconditions. Undocuqueer, as a form of resilience, hence, signified survival even when \nsocial conditions made it seem impossible to do so.  \nExclusionary and restrictionist policy across states perpetuated the stigmatization \nof LGBTQ and undocumented communities, and pushed participants into the closet and \ninto the shadows. Xavier, for example, described excising exceptional caution and self-\ncontrol navigating the outness of his social identities in the workplace, given the potential \n \t\r  153 \nconsequences enforced by state policy (or the lack thereof) targeting his (homo)sexuality \nand immigration status. Given the social and legal repercussions of being out as LGBTQ \nand/or undocumented, participants initially described a heightened level of sensitivity for \ndisclosing their social locations. Being out in certain spaces, while closeted and/or in the \nshadows in others, represented a survival tactic and a common experience amongst \nparticipants. Participants’ narratives highlighted how identity negotiation was often \nensued for safety and self-protection, as well as for the purpose of interacting and \nworking within the intersection of gender identity and expression, sexuality and \nimmigration status. The outcome was this feeling of having more than one social identity, \nwhich made it difficult for participants to develop a unified sense of self. Ester, for \nexample, described repressing expressions of her sexuality and gender nonconformance \nat home in order to retain the familial support she depended on. The contradiction \nbetween their physical and social presence as undocumented, in addition to the many \ncovert inequalities and biases based on gender and sexuality, made the process of coming \nout particularly difficult for undocuqueers. The prospect of family rejection at home, and \ntheir susceptibility to discrimination, detention and deportation kept several participants \nfrom fully liberating their LGBTQ and undocumented identities within the multiple \nspaces they occupied. \nConsistent with previous literature on LGBTQ migrants (Acosta, 2008; Anzaldúa, \n1987; Cantú, 1999, 2009; Gopinath, 2005; Manalansan, 1994, 2003), the present study \nhighlights how LGBTQ undocumented activists establish a hybrid culture through their \nundocuqueer identity, but not for the purpose of departing from LGBTQ and immigrant \nculture, rather for bridging them together. Ramon, for example, described undocuqueer as \n \t\r  154 \nhaving a responsibility to the education of his family and community regarding LGBTQ \nand immigration issues. Interlocked within heteronormative, homonormative and nativist \ndiscourses of belonging, participants described bringing their undocuqueer identity to the \nforefront in an effort to deconstruct essentialized notions of what it means to be \nundocumented and what it means to be LGBTQ within dominant LGBTQ and immigrant \nrights discourses. They often found themselves in the position of challenging oppressive \nnorms internalized by the communities they otherwise felt a part of. Undocuqueer meant \nnot only stimulating resistance, but also educating themselves and their communities \nabout the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status in order to build \nbridges between the LGBTQ and immigrant communities. Sharing their stories and \ndeconstructing essentialized conceptions of identity created a pathway for working inside \nthe dominant culture, while simultaneously critiquing it. \nParticipants’ narratives highlight how undocuqueers encounter contentious \nenvironments with policies that range from inclusive, restrictive, or unstipulated stances \naround LGBTQ and immigrant rights issues. Hence, their sense making of the \nintersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience is shaped by the \nsociopolitical context of their states around LGBTQ and immigration issues. Scholars \nhave argued that anti-immigrant and anti-LGBT political campaigns, in themselves, \nreflect, create, and sustain an environment that compromises the health and well-being of \nLGBTQ and undocumented individuals (Becerra, Androff, Cimino, Wagaman, & \nBlanchard, 2013; Levitt et al., 2009; Rotosky, Riggle, Horne, Denton, & Huellmeier, \n2010; Rostosky, Riggle, Horne, & Miller, 2009; Russell, Bohan, McCarroll, & Smith, \n2011; Russell & Richards, 2003; Salas, Ayón, & Gurrola, 2013). The results of this study \n \t\r  155 \nhighlights how the simultaneity of these affects, as experienced by LGBTQ \nundocumented immigrants, results in the manifestation of numerous challenges endemic \nto their gender identity and expression, sexuality and immigration status.  \nAs evidenced by participants’ narratives, undocuqueers are not just concerned \nabout family separation, a pathway to citizenship and access to higher education, as \nresearch on undocumented immigrants highlights (e.g., Diaz-Strong, Gómez, Luna-\nDuarte, & Meiners, 2011; Gonzales, 2008; Perez, Espinoza, Ramos, Coronado, & Cortes, \n2009; Suárez-Orozco, Yoshikawa, Teranishi, Suárez-Orozco, 2011). Nor are they just \nconcerned about non-accepting families, harassment and discrimination, as research on \nLGBTQ people highlights (e.g., Guarnero, 2007; Ibañez, Van Oss Marin, Flores, Millett, \n& Díaz, 2009; Rankin, 2003; Ryan et al., 2009; Sandford, Melendez, & Díaz, 2007). \nRather, they are concerned with both, in addition to the social and legal repercussions of \ncoming out both as undocumented and LGBTQ, and the ways that one identity affects the \nother’s ability to qualify for administrative relief programs and community support \nresources, for example. Their positionality as LGBTQ undocumented immigrants within \nthe overlapping margins of two single-variable identity-based social movements \nhighlights the challenge that undocuqueer immigrants pose for LGBTQ and immigrant \nrights frameworks: they challenge and directly confront normalizing discourses of \nbelonging undergirding LGBTQ and immigrant rights frameworks.  \nAs members of at least two subordinated groups that frequently pursue conflicting \npolitical agendas, undocuqueers do not fit the perimeters of citizenship and nationalism \nupheld by the LGBTQ and immigrant rights movements. These concepts present LGBTQ \nand immigrant rights in terms oriented to the dominant culture, and justify access to \n \t\r  156 \nrights by measuring worthiness according to norms reflective of white supremacy and \nheteropatriarchy (Collins, 2009a). This is because dominant groups are still very much \npresent in the LGBTQ (citizen) and immigrant rights (heterosexual) movements. \nOccupying a different position within gender, sexuality, and immigration status as \nintersecting systems of power, undocuqueers contest LGBTQ and immigrant rights \norganizations’ plight for inclusion within exclusionary systems. They challenge the \nnormative models of citizenship and nationalism that perpetuate the exclusion of LGBTQ \nand undocumented immigrants simultaneously within LGBTQ and immigrant rights \ndiscourses.  \nDoing so, undocuqueers defy the markers of “progress” handed down to us by \nmainstream LGBTQ and immigrant rights organizations that falsely perpetuate \nperceptions of equality: political recognition by officials and institutions that criminalize, \nincarcerate and deport members of our communities (Spade, 2013). Progress in the areas \nof marriage and citizenship do not comprehensively address issues of race, class, gender, \nsexuality and immigration status experienced by LGBTQ undocumented people of color. \nHence, who are the folks in a position to declare progress? A more social justice agenda \nwould entail not perpetuating the White supremacist, capitalist, heterosexist, patriarchal \nsystem that simultaneously oppresses LGBTQ people of color.  \nBecause claims of progress mask the plurality of experiences and attributes of the \nmembers of an identity group, the visibility of undocuqueers within the political context \nof LGBTQ and immigrant rights problematizes the exclusionary repercussions of unitary-\nidentity categorization that mostly benefit those who already have some structural \nprivileges. Working against exclusive policy based on one identity elides the experiences \n \t\r  157 \nof another by glossing over the interlocking nature of systems of oppression. Most queer \nand trans undocumented immigrants, for example, reap no benefits from the surface \nchange of formal legal equality. Their experiences help shed light on the systematic \nexclusion of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants within existing policy frameworks. \nBecause assimilation mutes identity as much as diversity amplifies it by highlighting \ndistinctions (Ghaziani, 2011), undocuqueers dispel notions of equality within collective \nidentity frameworks. Intersecting LGBTQ and immigration politics reveal the fallacy of \nassuming that gender, sexuality and immigration status affect all in similar ways. \nImplications \nThis study raises implications for further scholarship and applied policy/practice \nthat is inclusive of intersectional approaches. The absence of an intersectional approach \nto the study of LGBTQ and undocumented populations has actual material manifestations \nthat perpetuate inequality for LGBTQ undocumented immigrants in everyday life. \nInvestigating gender (non-conformance), sexuality and immigration status from a queer \nintersectional approach, for example, highlights the exclusion of individuals positioned at \nthe overlapping margins of two single-variable identity-based social movements. Failing \nto acknowledge their positionality perpetuates undocuqueers’ systematic exclusion from \nheteronormative immigration processes and homonormative advocacy agendas. As \nactivists and researchers, we need to be cognizant of the overlaps of identity; otherwise \nwe will continue to discriminate others based on their dissent from collective identity \nframeworks. \nSingle-variable identity-based social movements perpetuate what they are \nconstantly working against—inequality. There is no possibility of identifying as \n \t\r  158 \nundocuqueer if there is no visibility, exposure or representation of this positionality. For \nthis reason, we must strive toward greater inclusion by listening to the people excluded \nfrom representation. We need to constantly define the undefinable and move away from \nmainstream debates where everyone is equal. Highlighting members of the community \nwho possess multiply-oppressed identities and experiences that are otherwise glossed \nover by collective identity frameworks, we must resist the implicit suggestion that we \ncannot advocate for immigrants within LGBTQ rights discourses, and LGBTQ persons \nwithin immigrant rights discourses. In order to really address each issue, we have to \nsimultaneously analyze and critique both, and treat them as interlocking. \nBecause immigrant rights are LGBTQ rights, Congress should pass an \nimmigration reform that provides the more than 11.2 million undocumented immigrants \nin the U.S. a pathway to citizenship (Krogstad & Passel, 2014). This reform should allow \nundocumented immigrants to become full members of society, and provide them with the \nlegal certainty that they will not be torn away from their families and communities. \nLGBTQ undocumented immigrants, however, cannot continue to be the negotiating \npiece. We must get away from the framing that immigrant rights come at the expense of \nLGBTQ lives. Immigration reform should include a pathway to citizenship that \nrecognizes the distinct barriers facing the more than 267,000 LGBTQ-identified \nundocumented immigrants in the U.S., and guarantees them access to relief (Burns, \nGarcia, & Wolgin, 2013; Gates, 2013). It should remove barriers that would \ndisproportionately exclude LGBTQ immigrants. \nGranting relief to only undocumented immigrants who have familial ties to the \nU.S., for example, unfairly impacts LGBTQ undocumented immigrants because they are \n \t\r  159 \nless likely to have children or be recognized as parents in many of the states where they \nlive. Because the definition of family in U.S. immigration law presumes a \nheteronormative family structure and is limited to parents, spouses, and children of \nimmigrants, it does not apply to more complex family structures responsive to the animus \nagainst LGBTQ people embodied by U.S. culture and law. Discriminatory laws (e.g., \nsecond-parent/stepparent adoption restrictions) make same-sex couples much less likely \nto have legally recognized relationships with their children. Similarly, issues of family \nrejection and homelessness complicate LGBTQ undocumented immigrants eligibility for \nrelief based on family ties. Hence, without challenging the very definition of family and \nimmigration law’s reliance on it, as well as policies that restrict the rights of LGBTQ \npeople across states, the acquisition of legal status is thereby more likely to result for \nthose who already have some structural privileges (Chávez, 2010). \nThe passage of marriage equality through the courts has acknowledged equal \nprotection to LGBTQ persons under the 14th amendment of the U.S. constitution, and \nremediated some of the issues of recognition confronting the LGBTQ community. \nHowever, LGBTQ undocumented immigrants need more than just relationship \nrecognition. LGBTQ undocumented immigrants need the state to also recognize that they \nexist. Restrictive eligibility requirements and the limited number of visas available per \nyear make LGBTQ undocumented immigrants who entered the U.S. without inspection \nineligible to adjust their immigration status, even if married to a U.S. citizen (see \nArellano, 2012; Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996). \nFor this reason, LGBTQ rights need to move beyond homonormative discourses in order \nto better respond to the needs of LGBTQ undocumented immigrants. \n \t\r  160 \nLGBTQ undocumented immigrants face discrimination and exploitation because \nof their immigration status, in addition to discrimination based on sexual orientation, \ngender identity and expression. Though DACA has provided initial efforts to remediate \nthe lack of formal employment opportunities available to DREAMers, the program is \ntemporary and remains contingent upon restrictive eligibility criteria exclusive of the \nlived realities of being LGBTQ and undocumented within the context of the U.S. DACA \nrequires that applicants not be convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or \nmore other misdemeanors. Hence, as marginalized members of society pushed into \nsurvival work, many LGBTQ undocumented immigrants would not qualify under the \ncurrent deferred action programs because of low-level survival crimes, including sex \nwork as well as others connected to homelessness and poverty (Ray, 2006). For this \nreason, even passing legislation that provides employment non-discrimination protections \nfor LGBTQ workers on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity would not help \nLGBTQ undocumented immigrants obtain opportunities for formal employment, given \ntheir ineligibility for administrative relief. This is the same reality that would also \ndisqualify many LGBTQ undocumented immigrants from a more permanent solution, \nsuch as immigration reform.  \nWhile DACA and DAPA paved a path for administrative relief for many people, \nit also created a new set of priorities for immigration enforcement that have resulted in \nthousands of people being profiled, detained, and deported. Deportation is not the answer \nto a broken immigration system when there are over 78 countries with criminal laws \nagainst sexual activity by LGBTQ people (Itaborahy & Zhu, 2014). The absence of \ncriminalization (even within the U.S.) similarly does not demonstrate the absence of risk \n \t\r  161 \nof persecution and/or sufficiency of state protection for LGBTQ people. LGBTQ \nundocumented immigrants remain at risk of discrimination when their sexual orientation \nor gender identity and expression does not conform to prevailing cultural, political, or \nsocial norms. For this reason, it is critical that the U.S. remain a beacon of freedom and \nacceptance for LGBTQ undocumented immigrants.  \nA significant number of LGBTQ immigrants unable to obtain legal permission to \nmigrate to the U.S. arrive as undocumented immigrants. Some of them come seeking \nrefuge from structural violence, criminalization, persecution and discrimination faced in \ntheir home countries as a result of their sexuality, gender identity and gender expression. \nOthers arrived as children, and live with ongoing fear of rejection, deportation and family \nseparation as a result of their unresolved immigration status. Because identity is \ndiscursive, changing political contexts require researchers to continuously examine the \nshifting sociopolitical climate and its impact on lives of LGBTQ undocumented \nimmigrants. Scholars should remain attentive to the ways that power—through \nrepresentation, authorizing agents and discourse—legitimizes certain ways of being while \ninvalidating and consequently marginalizing others. Uncertainty regarding their future, \ncurrently, places LGBTQ undocumented immigrants in an unpredictable political battle \naround issues of employment, healthcare, immigration and higher education. More \nresearch is needed regarding the types of obstacles and hardships LGBTQ undocumented \nimmigrants experience as a result of their intersecting social identities and their shifting \nsociopolitical contexts in order to help convey the need for humane relief and LGBTQ \nliberation. \n  \n \t\r  162 \nBecause this study focused primarily on the intersection of gender, sexuality and \nimmigration status, future work should similarly explore the intersections of other salient \nidentities (e.g., race, class, gender) that similarly impact undocuqueers’ \nconceptualizations of their identities. This exploration would help us better understand \nhow the centrality of gender, sexuality and immigration status to an individual’s \nexperience may be mediated by other factors that may be more salient in certain contexts. \nFor example, in this study, all 31 participants self-identified as Latino/a, therefore it \nwould be important to understand how the perceived climate toward non-Latinos/as in the \nU.S. differentially impacts non-Latino/a LGBTQ undocumented immigrants’ \nunderstandings of their gender, sexuality and immigration status.  Contextualizing \ngender, sexuality and immigration status with respect to individuals’ racial and ethnic \nidentities might help us better understand the nuances of U.S. race relations, as they \ninterplay with other salient social identities. \nIn this study, there was also an imbalance in representation by gender. Seventeen \nof my participants identified as cisgender men, and my analysis was heavily influenced \nby their gendered experiences. The perspectives of womyn and other trans identities were \novershadowed by the re-inscription of patriarchy and cisgender privilege even within \nundocuqueer spaces. Acknowledging these limitations, it is important to explore the \nperspectives of womyn and other trans identities within the intersection of gender, \nsexuality and immigration status in order to help dismantle the inherent patriarchal \ncisgender privilege that dominates heteronormative/ homonormative spaces. Accounting \nfor these differences in experience may help provide a more complete snapshot of power \nand privilege within multiply-marginalized experiences. \n \t\r  163 \nLastly, the majority of my participants (21) were DACA recipients, which \nsuggests that they also benefited from the relative privilege of the “good immigrant” \nDREAMer narrative. Eligible for relief from deportation, renewable work permits, and \ntemporary Social Security numbers, their bestowed legal presence enabled them to do \nthings significantly different from those who did not meet the strict DACA eligibility \nrequirements. Additional research exploring these specific differences should be \nconducted to account for the ways that LGBTQ experiences interplay, specifically, with \nDACA eligibility and the DREAMer identity. \nConclusion \nBecause undocuqueers are affected by both anti-immigrant and heterosexist \npower structures simultaneously, the stressors associated with their gender identity and \nexpression, sexuality and immigration status illustrate how undocuqueer immigrants are \nconstantly navigating multiple worlds. They work hard to develop their own public \nnarrative, reject discourse they feel harms them, and combat the consistent erasure of \ntheir experiences at the overlapping margins of two single-variable identity-based social \nmovements. Being both queer and undocumented has opened the path for undocuqueers \nto express their lives as one struggle. LGBTQ and immigrant rights are not parallel \nmovements, but rather intersecting ones in the fight for social justice. For this reason, \nundocuqueers are challenging the traditional organizing ways of mainstream LGBTQ and \nimmigrant rights organizations by defying single-issue politics, and demanding a place at \nthe table as decisions that directly impact them are being made. They are building \ncommunity, speaking out and mobilizing for the acknowledgement of their intersectional \nexperiences. They seek to bring an end to the state violence inflicted upon their identities \n \t\r  164 \nby weaving threads of queer visibility, inclusion and liberation into the narrative fabric of \nimmigration, and threads of transnationalism and immigration within the narrative fabric \nof LGBTQ rights. Protecting the unity of their immigrant families and the dignity of their \nLGBTQ communities is at the center of their organizing and advocacy efforts.  \nAs Jesse, an undocuqueer activist from Arizona, highlighted in his narrative, the \nLGBTQ rights movement fails to include the challenges of being undocumented. \n…it’s supposed to be the home of the LGBT, fighting for our rights, but the fact \nthat you are undocumented, or even bigger, the fact that you’re an immigrant or \nperson of color, being left out of this vision is what I think affects me more, \nbecause any win that we have gotten as queer people most of the time has not \nbeen a win for myself or my community.  \nSimilarly, the movement towards immigration reform leaves untouched the needs of \nLGBTQ voices. \nAnd I think it was very present to me during this past Obama announcement, \nwhere I wanted to be happy because my parents were not queer and were \nbenefiting from it, but the negotiating piece. Nowhere in that [announcement] \nLGBT lives are acknowledged whatsoever. \nHence, LGBTQ undocumented immigrants rarely receive the attention or the space they \ndeserve. As we look at issues of LGBT and immigrant rights separately, we do not quite \nget a glimpse of the lives or experiences of individuals outside of these normative \nconceptions of what it means to be LGBTQ and what it means to be undocumented. As \nlong as issues of criminalization, poverty, and discrimination are left out of an agenda, \nthe agenda is not really improving the conditions for all people within an identity \n \t\r  165 \ncategory, nor is it addressing the more pressing concerns of basic freedom and survival \nfor queer and trans immigrants facing criminalization for poverty, participation in sex \ntrade, homelessness, and the stigma of “illegality.”  \n \t\r  166 \nREFERENCES \nAbes, E.

    "abstract": "abstract: Employing Queer Intersectionality, this study explored how undocuqueer activists made sense of, interacted and worked within the intersection of their LGBTQ and undocumented experience. Participants ascribed three overarching self-meanings: Vulnerability, Complexity, and Resilience. These self-meanings describe the ways participants perceived the interplay of their gender, sexuality and immigration status within the current sociopolitical context of the U.S. Recognizing their vulnerability within a state of illegibility, participants described a sense of exclusion within spaces of belonging, and wariness managing relationships with others; opting for more complex self-definitions, they resisted simplistic conceptions of identity that rendered their social locations invisible (e.g., homonormativity, heteronormativity, DREAMer); and describing themselves as resilient, they described surviving societal as well as familial rejection even when surviving seemed impossible to do so. Interacting and working within the intersection of gender, sexuality and immigration status, participants described identity negotiation and coming out as a form of resistance to institutionalized oppression, and resilience amidst simultaneous anti-immigrant, xenophobic and heterosexist power structures. Participants learned to live in multiple worlds at the same time, and embrace the multiplicity of their undocuqueer identity while seeking to bridge their communities through stories, activism and peer education. This study has implications for further understanding the way that queer politics and identity interact/ relate with various axes of inequality.Dissertation/ThesisDoctoral Dissertation Educational Leadership and Policy Studies 201",
