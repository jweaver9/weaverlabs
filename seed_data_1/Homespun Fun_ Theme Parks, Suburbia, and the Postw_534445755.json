Zeh, Ph.D., DeanGraduate School i  Abstract Scholars of theme parks and their histories recognize that a carefully crafted family-friendly environment is the cornerstone of the themed amusement landscape dating back to the 1950s. From marketing and promotional material; to in-park signage and ride narratives; to the themes of childlike wonder and family fun, theme parks have made the heterosexual nuclear family unit the prototypical park visitor. This project explores the histories and geographies of theme parks and their privileging of the heterosexual family unit through a queer framework. It focuses on Disneyland, and Six Flags Over Texas in latter half of the twentieth century, tracing the development of the two metropolitan regions alongside studies of suburban imaginaries. It demonstrates how reading theme park marketing material, ride narratives, and other aspects of the theme park landscape through a queer lens exposes the centrality of the heterosexual family. Using a queer lens also unearths moments of gender and sexual alterity in these materials. I argue that the heterosexual family unit was a mainstay of theme park marketing and theming throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s despite the increasing visibility and inclusion of LGBTQ-identified visitors, and despite the queer potentialities of the theme park landscape.  ii  Acknowledgements  This project originated from an off-hand comment in a semi-official program progress meeting with my committee and quickly became one of the most delightful and rewarding writing projects, so I need to start by thanking them for reminding me that sometimes you can just totally research the things you love, like theme parks.

Unlike most visitors to the weekly dance and romance night for teens and young adults, Exler and Elliott were at the park that night to test its policies against “same-sex fast-dancing.” The two teen boys took to the dancefloor at the Tomorrowland Terrace, but stories allege that within five minutes, they were surrounded by a group of security guards and summarily removed from the park. Exler stated that “security officers told us that members of the same sex are prohibited from dancing together” and pulled the two from the dancefloor “to protect the interests of other patrons.”1 Exler and Elliott took the issue to court, arguing that the security guards were in violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act of California, beginning a lengthy and costly legal battle. The Unruh Civil Rights Act was a 1959 revision of the state’s original Civil Rights Act which expanded protections against various kinds of discrimination to private businesses as well as a more comprehensive set of public accommodations. Despite the fact that the act did not explicitly protect from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation until 2005, attorney’s representing Exler and Elliott claimed that Disneyland’s dancing policy discriminated “against the plaintiffs on the basis of their sex and sexual preference.”2                                                      1 “fantasyland for whom?” Gay Community News, Vol. 8, No. 20, December 6, 1980, pg. 20, “queers vs. disneyland,” Andrew Ross Exler, Gay Community News, Vol. 9, No. 13, October 17, 1981, pg. 24, “Activism Can Be Costly,” Andrew Ross Exler, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 12, No. 1, January 7, 1982, pg. 8. 2 Cited in preliminary statement in appeals case for Exler & Elliott v.

Across the nation, in fact, LGBTQ individuals and communities were pushing back against discriminatory laws and policies and working toward visibility and inclusion into mainstream institutions like theme parks. In the late-1970s, for example, California’s LGBTQ activists mobilized to defeat Proposition 6 which, among other things, would have made it significantly easier for school boards across the state to fire teachers for suspected homosexual conduct. In the aftermath of this victory, it was not surprising to see cases like Exler and Elliott’s lawsuit against the California theme park. Likewise, the park’s policies against same-sex couples dancing did not come as a surprise for most observers, both in and outside the LGBTQ community. At its core, the issue over same-sex dancing of any kind in the Disneyland park relied upon two interrelated assumptions: that theme parks, especially Disneyland, were sites of family-friendly entertainment and leisure; and that two teenaged boys dancing together disrupted that family-friendly environment.

See for example Stoumen v. Reilly 1951.     3  This dissertation explores the ways in which the creative and marketing team behind Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas established their family-friendly brands over the course of the latter-half of the twentieth century. It also examines how LGBTQ activists like Exler and Elliott pushed for inclusion by challenging discriminatory policies and by hosting social events in Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland from the 1970s onward, building on the momentum of other highly visible contemporary legal contests. Lastly, it situates the history of these theme parks and LGBTQ activism within the broader history of suburbanization of Orange County in California and of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in Texas and considers how the spatial techniques and cultural logics that matured in the suburbs influenced theme park design and theming as well as the subsequent efforts of LGBTQ individuals to claim space in these monuments to postwar American culture.     Disneyland is the obvious choice for any form of theme park history. In an article for the San Mateo County Times in 1967, author Jack Russell claimed that “To the world in general and California in particular, there is only one Disneyland. All other amusement parks are measured against it.”4 From its opening days well into the contemporary moment, Disneyland was and continues to be envisioned as the prototypical theme park. Even definitions of the term “theme park” rely on referencing the layout, technologies, and practices that were perfected by Walt Disney in and his team of “imagineers” in Disneyland.5 Six Flags Over Texas, on the other hand, may seem like an unlikely                                                      4 “Six Flags Recieves [sic] Plaudits,” Jack Russell, reprinted in Six Flags Gazette, Summer, 1967, pg. 3. 5 “Imagineer” is the official Disney term for park planners, designers, and a host of other creatives. https://sites.disney.com/waltdisneyimagineering/. 4  candidate for a history of theme parks. As Disneyland historian David Koenig states in the sequel to his provocative behind-the-scenes look into the Magic Kingdom, “Six Flags operates amusement parks. Disneyland is a theme park, and, to purists, there’s a world of difference.”6 These alleged purists of theme parks point to a number of key differences that separate these two parks in particular, such as one commentator who noted that “Six Flags doesn’t give you the feeling of fantasy or magic when you enter.”7 Another asserted that “It’s asinine to compare Six Flags to Disney when no one (except for maybe Universal) can live up to Disney’s standards.”8 These comparisons between Disney and Six Flags parks have existed since the latter entered the industry in 1961, but the differences between them as represented by Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas has grown starker in recent decades.  Six Flags Over Texas, which opened in 1961 in Arlington, Texas, was in many ways a contemporary of Disneyland. Angus Wynne, Jr., then-president of the Great Southwest Corporation, hired C. V. Wood, Jr., and the Marco Engineering Company to oversee the design of Six Flags Over Texas. Wood, Jr., headed the design team of Disneyland and served as its executive vice president for a few years, and Wynne, Jr., banked on that experience to help him engineer the Texas-type Disneyland.9 Media                                                      6 David Koenig, More Mouse Tales: A Closer Peek Backstage at Disneyland, 2002, pg. 17. 7 “Why Six Flags Fails and Disney Succeeds,” Sierra Vieregge, AllEars fan blog, April 27, 2019, https://allears.net/2019/04/27/why-six-flags-fails-and-disney-succeeds/.  8 Comment from comment section provided by username “Greg” on “Why Six Flags Fails and Disney Succeeds.” 9 “Amusement Park Work Under Way,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, September 27, 1960, pg. 6, “Fort Worth, Dallas Get Together in Cow Pasture,” Elizabeth Carpenter, Abilene Reporter-News, Abilene, Texas, July 20, 1959, pg. 11A. 5  outlets and even Wynne, Jr., himself, were keen to draw comparisons between Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas throughout the 1960s, heralding these theme parks as new evolutions in family amusement and leisure.10 One writer for The Washington Post-Times Herald in 1964 declared that “Six Flags rivals any ‘theme park’ in the country for success, including the West Coast giant, Disneyland.”11 But, following the 1970 departure of the park’s original creator, Angus Wynne, Jr., promoters began to gradually shift focus away from emphasizing themed landscapes and toward foregrounding the park’s record-breaking rides. Before this pivot during the 1970s, however, promoters at Six Flags Over Texas sought to replicate the Disneyland blueprint in Texas. They organized the park around themed lands, each with distinct rides, sounds, and aesthetics dedicated to the histories of the six nations that ruled over Texas. They similarly aimed to attract families first and foremost, marketing the park as educational and entertaining for all ages. This formula proved relatively successful for Six Flags Over Texas, but the park never reached attendance figures comparable to Disneyland. Still, promoters tried to keep in step with the theme park paradigm established by Disneyland during the early decades. Comparing these two theme parks helps to illustrate how theme parks came to be understood in the broader American cultural during the postwar moment. While Six Flags Over Texas                                                      10 “King Fun Rules at U.S. Theme Parks,” Roger Swanson, The Kansas City Star, Kansas City, Missouri, August 11, 1963, pg. 14D, “Exciting Past Comes Alive In America’s Magic Lands,” Horace Sutton, The Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, August 7, 1960, pg. 46, “Six Flags a Wonder Of Fun, History, Thrills,” Elston Brooks, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 6, 1961, pg. 12. 11 “Texas Park Combines History and Fun,” The Washington Post, Times Herald, May 17, 1964, pg. K6. 6  moved further and further away from some of the characteristics that defined its early decades of operation, Disneyland remained relatively unchanged. As such, while Disneyland—and later Disney World—maintained their statuses as preeminent theme parks in the American cultural imaginary, Six Flags Over Texas and the larger Six Flags chain of parks morphed into a subspecies of the theme park: one defined by towering and tightly-packed roller coasters, rides, and attractions and less by a sense of thematic cohesion.  Theme parks did not gain popularity in the United States until the beginning of the 1950s, and as such, the literature on theme park history is sparse, especially on theme parks that are not Disneyland. This dissertation combs through what exists on theme park history, but also incorporates insights from scholars in other disciplines, as well as histories of other sites of amusement, like Coney Island and Luna Park in Brooklyn, New York. The primary difference between the theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas and other amusement parks like Coney Island is that theme parks have “one or more prominent themes carried throughout the entire amusement venue.”12 Scott A. Lukas states that theme parks establish an otherworldly oasis for their visitors. They use their theming the transport their visitors “physically, mentally, aesthetically, politically and existentially” to someplace else.13 Outside of the specific geographies, scholars have noted that theme parks, and Disney parks in particular, cultivate a sense of place outside of the bounds of specific geographies. They describe Disneyland’s Main Street USA as the ersatz Mainstreet, or as the emblematic placeless place. This dissertation takes these                                                      12 Scott A. Lukas, Theme Park, pg. 37. 13 Lukas, pg. 66. 7  theories of theme parks and place and approaches theme from a historical perspective to uncover a change-over-time, demonstrate the changes definitional parameters of theme parks throughout the latter-half of twentieth century. Nearly every biographer of Disneyland tells the well-worn story of Disney’s 1951 visit to Tivoli Gardens, one of the world’s longest operating amusement parks in Copenhagen, Denmark. In The Disneyland Story, for example, Sam Gennawey explains how Walt and Art Linkletter ventured to the park together to get a better sense of amusement centers in Europe. Gennawey states that upon seeing the over-100-year-old park, Disney turned to wife Lillian and exclaimed; “Now this is what an amusement park should be.”14 As early as the middle of the 1970s, though, Disney parks had become the standard bearer for theme parks in American culture. As journalist Richard Joseph wrote in his article about theme parks for the Chicago Tribune, there was a time when “all you needed for an amusement park was a hot dog stand, a roller coaster and a Ferris wheel—but that was PDW (pre-Walt Disney).” He argued that Disneyland “created a whole new concept for the amusement park business,” so much so that, “Now amusement parks are called theme parks.”15 A 1973 article for the Associated Press by Kay Bartlett explained that in pure industry terms, Disneyland and Disney World were “destination parks,” whereas parks like those in the Six Flags and Marriott Corp. families were “theme parks.” The former drew families from around the world whereas the latter drew “80 per cent of                                                      14 Here Sam Gennawey is quoting Walt from a 1984 cast member brochure and handbook titled “The Spirit Of Disneyland,” in The Disneyland Story: The Unofficial Guide to the Evolution of Walt’s Disney Dream, Keen Communications, 2014, pg. 16.  15 “Theme parks popping up all over the landscape,” Richard Joseph, Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, May 9, 1976, pg. 1H. 8  their customers from a 50-mile radius.” Theme parks, despite lacking the pull of destination parks, were still different than “the old Coney Island parks where a mass of rides and hot dog stands were tossed together haphazardly.”16 Bartlett’s comments underscore that, by the 1970s, journalists and outside commentators were beginning to compare and contrast parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas, and Disney parks were beginning to pull away from the pack, despite the efforts of the latter to keep apace. Through the 1970s, it was becoming apparent that these two parks were of different sizes and scales, both in terms of the crowds the drew and, perhaps most importantly, in terms of their presence and impact in the broader national and international culture. This dissertation traces the development of these disparities between the two parks and explores how each park contended with their respective roles in the broader American zeitgeist. Although the historiographical and contemporary definitions of the theme park seem coherent, it is important to reiterate that even the designation of “theme park”—as opposed to “amusement park” or any other variant—was in flux throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Prior to their opening, journalists and promoters alike for both Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas seemed to be unsure as to the official label for these new breeds of amusement parks. For Six Flags Over Texas, for example, journalists used terms like “$10,000,000 entertainment center,” “amusement center,” “amusement park,” “fun center,” and “Disneyland-type sports and recreation center.” Among these, “entertainment center” and “amusement park” seemed to have the most traction with the                                                      16 “Amusement Parks Great, But Not All Cities Welcome Them,” Kay Bartlett, Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, June 3, 1973, pg. 1G. 9  reading public.17 But there are examples as early as 1968 of Six Flags promotional material references the term “theme park.” The 1968 Six Flags Gazette included an article reflecting on the overall success of the park to that point, stating that the pristine landscape and bright hosts and hostesses with their “candy-striped, well-starched uniforms” helped make Six Flags Over Texas unique. Commenting on the unusual outdoor air-conditioning throughout the park, the article claims, “Six Flags is not the usual theme park operation.”18  Disney and Wynne, Jr., also drew major inspiration from the rhetoric, techniques, and cultural values of the postwar suburban Sunbelt. More than just a physical location, Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas paralleled their host suburbs of Anaheim and Arlington in profound ways, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Eric Avila makes a direct connection to Disneyland and the suburban landscape. One of Avila’s more innovative insights is demonstrating the role that theme parks, specifically Disneyland, play in our popular imaginary of urban and suburban spaces and the place of race in each. Unlike other popular urban parks and amusement locations of the twentieth century, like Coney Island, Walt Disney selected the suburban Anaheim for the location of his theme                                                      17 “Astrolift Here—Finally,” The Daily News-Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, July 23, 1961, pg. 1, “9000 Workers In GSC Seen in ’61,” The Daily News-Texan, April 6, 1961, pg. 14, “Fun Center Ready to Start Talent Search,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, April 17, 1961, pg. 5, “’Six Flags Over Texas’: New Amusement Park to Open,” The Marshall News Messenger, Marshall, Texas, July 30, 1961, pg. A-9, “$420,000 Site Will Be Sold,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, June 19, 1959, pg. 16. Disneyland has a similar lineage with respect to its terminology. See, “’Disneyland’ Plans Told By Creator,” Aline Mosby, The Progress Bulletin, Pomona, California, May 11, 1954, pg. 5-2. 18 Six Flags Gazette, Summer 1968 in Grand Prairie Daily News, Grand Prairie, Texas, April 7, 1968, pg. 5. 10  park, well outside the edges of Los Angeles. As such, Disneyland was spatially isolated from its nearest urban center. This spatial distance simultaneously worked to distance Disneyland from the postwar urban imaginary—one littered with images of decay and decline as seen in the many noir films and television shows of the era. The result was that Disneyland’s visitors could walk through and enjoy the urban landscape in insulated park sections like Main Street USA without the fear and danger of actual urban environs. These sanitized urban spaces worked in tandem with the park’s attractions like the Hall of Presidents and Rocket to the Moon to offer visitors a distinctly American landscape consisting of soothing images of an idealized past, present, and future, or as Avila remarks, “the utopian aspirations of the suburban society.”19 Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas are located in former bedroom communities of larger sister cities—Los Angeles and Dallas respectively. As such, part of this project examines the particular spatial arrangements and growth of the suburbs in the late-twentieth century, building off of the works of scholars of the suburbs like Kenneth Jackson and Kevin Kruse. As they and other historians have noted, the suburbs of the latter half of the twentieth century were primarily homogenous in terms of their residents. My study adds to studies of the suburbs by examining the two regions during and toward the end of the primacy of the suburbs, and by focusing on theme parks, which are simultaneously in the suburbs and of the suburbs. To address the suburban-ness of these two parks in particular, this dissertation builds upon scholarship that examines the growth of “suburbia” in media, advertising, and the broader public sphere. According to Kenneth                                                      19 Eric Avila, Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight, pg. 21. 11  Jackson, “suburbia” is the set of cultural associations with America’s dominant post-war residential pattern, including “conspicuous consumption, a reliance upon the private automobile, upward mobility, the separation of the family into nuclear units, the widening division between work and leisure, and a tendency toward racial and economic exclusiveness.”20 Similarly, Jackson states that America’s suburbs are equally “a planning type and a state of mind based on imagery and symbolism.”21  Kruse reminds us that these cultural images and symbols of the suburbs coincided with a growing conservative political rhetoric that shifted away from “traditional, populist, and often starkly racist demagoguery” and toward “a new conservatism predicated on a language of rights, freedoms, and individualism.”22 His work on conservatism in postwar Atlanta and Lisa McGirr’s work on conservative “kitchen-table activists” in Orange County illustrate how many suburbs became the breeding ground for far right political discourses that would inevitably help reshape the mainstream Republic Party platform.23 While Arlington falls within the Sunbelt Suburb definition, chapter one and chapter four will demonstrate that it and the broader Dallas-Fort Worth region developed relatively tepid and nonconfrontational conservative politics, especially compared to the firebrand citizens and representatives of Anaheim. Regardless, both Arlington and Anaheim exhibited aspects of this burgeoning postwar conservative rhetoric in their politics and in their broader local cultures.                                                       20 Jackson, pg. 4. 21 Jackson, pg. 4-5. 22 Kevin M. Kruse, White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism, pg. 6. 23 Kruse, White Flight, pg. 8, Lisa McGirr, Suburban Warriors: The Origins of the New American Right, pg. 6-7. 12  As discussed earlier in the introduction, the Exler decision hinged upon the language of California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, which is a reminder that these theme parks are inevitably tied to the states and municipalities in which they reside. Moreover, it is a reminder that much of what was up for debate in the Exler case was whether or not two men’s right to dance together violated the rights of Disneyland to police guests’ behavior, and ultimately whether or not same-sex dancing was appropriate for the family-friendly theme park. As such, it is important to unpack the ways in which the “child” and the “family” functioned both in explicit political discourses surrounding homosexuality and in the broader culture during the postwar moment. As Robert O. Self demonstrates in his tome on postwar political culture, the most salient feature of political discourses from the 1950s onward was the idealized, heteronormative American family, and the trajectory of political issues went broadly “from a demand for positive rights and robust state action to a reluctant acceptance of negative rights and a weaker state more committed to liberty than equality.”24  And at the center of these conversations was the image of the “child.” As many scholars have noted, the child functions in political and cultural discourses as a vector through which we stake our future as a nation. It evokes purity and innocence, and as such is something that requires protecting. As Lynn Spigel explains, “childhood—or at least the image of the innocent youth to which this category refers—can exist only through a certain disciplinary power that…operates to regulate knowledge.” It exists                                                      24 Robert O. Self, All in the Family: The Realignment of American Democracy since the 1960s, pg. 12. 13  “only so long as the young are protected from certain types of knowledge.”25 Lee Edelman calls the use of the child in political and cultural discourses “an ideological Mobius strip,” and “a disciplinary image that works to police the boundaries of propriety.”26 Edelman cites battles between the perennial child of Peter Pan and the unmarried Captain Hook to show how popular media similarly reproduces this discourse of childhood under assault.27 Theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were envisioned as landscapes dedicated to childhood.   Chapters one through three serve to explore how theme parks catered to the child and simultaneously constructed knowledge about normative and acceptable gendered performances. Like the Exler case, then, chapter four addresses how these corporations and the broader public responded to LGBTQ individuals seeking inclusion in these theme parks, and how these individuals and communities worked within the parameters of cultural and political discourses surrounding theme parks to do so. Activists like Exler and others that organized LGBTQ events or incursions in theme parks were building upon deeper legacies of LGBTQ politics that pushed back against pathologizing and stigmatizing logics. As recent as Anita Bryant’s campaigns to “Save Our Children from Homosexuality,” conservative politicians were railing against gay rights and homosexuality more broadly as insidious and harmful to children in particular. As mentioned earlier, California’s LGBTQ community was coming off a victory over Proposition 6, also known as the Briggs Initiative, which would have made “advocating,                                                      25 Lynn Spigel, Welcome to the Dreamhouse: Popular Media and Postwar Suburbs, pg. 190. 26 Lee Edelman, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive, pg. 2, 31. 27 Edelman, pg. 21. 14  soliciting, imposing, encouraging or promoting private or public” same-sex sex acts “likely to come to the attention of other employees or students” grounds for termination for public school employees.28 Although the Briggs Initiative was defeated, it and Bryant’s rhetoric reflected public political and cultural debates from the 1950s onward that painted gay and lesbian teachers as infiltrators aiming to convert susceptible children to homosexuality. This argument had been successfully employed against gay and lesbian schoolteachers throughout the era.29 It also tapped into an enduring belief that homosexuality was dangerous to the child and to the nation, which was a belief dating back to the early-twentieth century, when sexologists and other specialists tied homosexual behavior to “gender inversion” and other abnormal and criminal behaviors.30 Challenging Disneyland’s policies against same-sex dancing and organizing LGBTQ events at Six Flags Over Texas, then, was a direct challenge against the heteronormative social and cultural order embodied by the child, ensconced in the gated landscapes of suburban theme parks. Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were cultural products born out of the suburbs in a material and ideological sense, and consequently were influenced by postwar consumerism and the kind of conservative “middle-class entitlement” that Matthew                                                      28 “School Employees, Homosexuality, Initiative Statute,” California Voters Pamphlet, General Election, November 7, 1978, pg. 28, https://web.archive.org/web/20060818145437/http://library.uchastings.edu/ballot_pdf/1978g.pdf 29 Daniel Rivers, Radical Relations: Lesbian Mothers, Gay Fathers & Their Children in the United States since World War II, pg. 3, see also Jackie M.

Both Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland represented the postwar longing to celebrate the colonial past of America. Alexander Wilson argues that “rather than signaling the end of history, the theme park exemplifies its collapse—all eras and figures exist simultaneously, reduced to funny anecdotes or sound bites about liberty.”32 These narratives helped to produce “a vision of an ‘American Century’ of imperialist control and also a nostalgia for Western colonial hegemony.”33 To Wilson’s point, theme parks tend to rely on reductive and teleological historical narratives, relying on evoking what Gary Cross calls a “fantastic nostalgia” as opposed to the “grounded nostalgia” of heritage sites and other public history endeavors.34 As chapter three illustrates, these narratives typically employ racist caricatures or otherwise narrow depictions of Native Americans, Mexicans, and ethnic whites. These narratives are made doubly egregious when we consider that they were rarely crafted with any input from the communities whose histories they claim to represent.35  The theme park is first and foremost and business. It is an immersive and interactive landscape built upon a foundation of consumerism. As such, understanding                                                      31 Matthew D. Lassiter, The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South, pg. 2-3. 32 Eric Smoodin summarizing Alexander Wilson in Disney Discourse: Producing the Magic Kingdom, pg. 9. 33 Smoodin, Disney Discourse: Producing the Magic Kingdom, pg. 10. 34 Gary Cross, Consumed Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism, pg. 205. 35 For more on public history sites and community collaboration more broadly, see Amy Lonetree, Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums. For more about public history practices in the 1950s, see Freeman Tilden, Interpreting Our Heritage. 16  the power of the theme park to generate knowledge relies on understanding the ways in which they produce media and products to be consumed by a vast and diverse visiting public. Here, this dissertation takes inspiration from formative scholarship on gender and consumer culture, like Kathey Peiss’s Hope in a Jar and Lizabeth Cohen’s A Consumers’ Republic. Peiss outlines the newfound power of consumption at the turn of the century, focusing on women and the burgeoning beauty market. Peiss notes that the in the previous century, so-called ‘painted women’ were viewed as duplicitous or cultural dupes who wore masks or painted over their imperfections in vain. By the 1920s, however, after the popularization of make-up and other beauty products, consuming and using said products “connoted a medium of self-expression in a consumer society where identity had become a purchasable style.”36 Peiss demonstrates how women, rather than simple dupes, used the act of consumption of advertised images and other media products to forge a new sociability and a new landscape of individual and communal opportunity.  Cohen takes up the issue of consumer culture in the postwar moment and argues that consuming became a new realm of civic expression and political discourse, resulting in the coalescing the Americans as citizens and consumers. This “consumers’ republic” was “an economy, culture, and politics built around the promises of mass consumption, both in terms of material life and the more idealistic goals of greater freedom, democracy, and equality.”37 The suburb was the landscape onto which these new ideals manifested most clearly. Theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland were monuments of                                                      36 Peiss, Hope in a Jar: The Making of America’s Beauty Culture, pg. 4. 37 Lizabeth Cohen, A Consumers’ Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America, pg. 7. 17  this new republic, and the first three chapters of this dissertation explores how they both exhibited and reproduced these postwar ideals. The theme park is a tricky space inasmuch as it is chocked full of both products and media to be consumed. As such, this dissertation reads theme park rides, attractions, and other themed elements in the park both as consumer products like Peiss and Cohen and as pieces of media akin to movies or television shows. Media scholars Harry M. Benshoff and Sean Griffin argue that film, in particular, “taught use what it means to be heroic or villainous, masculine or feminine, heterosexual or homosexual,” and in their analysis, they note that ostensibly “straight” films, like Top Gun (1986), are often coopted by queer individuals and cultures.38 This dissertation borrows from their theoretical formulations of queering the film viewing experience to expose the ways in which marketing material and themed elements in both Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas instruct and inform visitors, particularly in relation to normative gendered scripts. But, just as with their example of coopting Top Gun, chapter four argues that both Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were filled with queer potential. In Tinker Belles and Evil Queens, Sean Griffin explores the historical connections between the Disney brand and queer camp culture in particular.39 Chapter four extends Griffin’s analysis to the products and landscapes of Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas to illustrate how LGBTQ individuals and communities engaged with these media products in unique ways.                                                      38 Harry Benshoff and Sean Griffin, Queer Images: A History of Gay and Lesbian Film in America, pg. 11-17. 39 Griffin, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out, pg. 67-77. 18  In analyzing theme park ride narratives and elements as pieces of media, it is important to remember that, as Kristen Hoerl argues, “no one interpretation can make universalizing claims about the meaning” of these products, but they do “implicitly invite audiences to develop shared associations and understandings about past events” by relying on similar visual technologies and languages.40 Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas developed in tandem throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, using many of the same themes, ride layouts, and technologies in their efforts to transport visitors to an imagined past or give them a glimpse of a fantastic future. Angus Wynne, Jr., borrowed extensively from Walt Disney, and Disney relied heavily on his and creative teams’ experience producing films and short animated features for audiences. As such, it is fruitful to analyze the ways in which theme parks might be construed as similar to film and other visual media sources. Moreover, these park progenitors borrowed from the cultural rhetoric and visual lexicon of the broader American culture at the time even as they sought to create an otherworldly feeling, magnifying their ability as knowledge producers in the postwar moment. As such, this dissertation builds on the scholarship of Eric Avila, who centers his analysis of postwar suburbia on the film noir genre and depictions of race, sexuality, and space in it and various other popular culture products. For Avila, pop culture products worked throughout the early-postwar period to sequester racial and sexual tensions in the public imaginary into urban spaces, just as the majority of white, heterosexual American families began to move away from these spaces and into the suburbs. As the geographic space between urban centers and suburban peripheries                                                      40 Kristen Hoerl, The Bad Sixties: Hollywood Memories of the Counterculture, Antiwar, and Black Power Movements, pg. 22. 19  grew, some media and pop culture products transposed this spatial divide onto the cultural imaginary. In other words, media helped to create the correlating yet antithetical images and discourses of the “chocolate city” and the “vanilla suburb.”41 Walt Disney tapped into these discourses and reproduced them in his theme park, and Wynne, Jr., would follow suit in 1961. Lynn Spigel notes that one central facet of suburban living was the living room, where the heterosexual nuclear family gathered regularly to watch television. She argues that the television acted as portal where suburban families could spectate the world around them vicariously through fictional shows or through news segments. Spigel states that Disneyland represented the coalescing of several characteristics of the suburbs in a single geographic location, where adults and kids alike could rediscover the whimsy of youth in safe and sanitized themed worlds like Tomorrowland.42 This dissertation compares the suburban sensibilities that informed the theming of Disneyland to those that inspired Six Flags Over Texas to demonstrate how the two parks had strikingly similar goals and methods during the early years. Comparing these two parks also unveils how certain aspects of postwar suburbia were regional in nature, with Six Flags Over Texas representing the uneasy suburbanization of the Old South in contrast to Disneyland and Orange County, both of which came to represent the quintessential suburban and theme park space.                                                       41 Avila, Popular Culture in the Age of White Flight, pg. 9. 42 Spigel, Welcome to the Dreamhouse: Popular Media and Postwar Suburbs, pg. 382-83. 20  The latter half of this dissertation examines direct LGBTQ individual and community efforts to claim space and challenge discrimination in the heteronormative landscapes of Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas, though all chapters borrow analytical frameworks from Queer Studies scholars as well as methods from the more traditional LGBTQ historiography. Scholars often speak of “queering” various archives or histories, wherein they incorporate the work of queer theory to interrogate and destabilize various social categories, primarily in regard to gender identities and sexualities.43 The resulting scholarship has shown how, where, and why certain categories of difference are constructed historically; how they change over time; and how they come to bear on the daily lives of everyday people. Works in the field are often as much about normative categories as they are about queer experiences, performances, identities, and communities.44 My work recognizes the ways in which queer history and theory developed as a critique of various normativities and has since expanded to encompass a vast array of approaches, topics, and conclusions. What emerges throughout this historiography is how scholars are—and should be—increasingly conscious of how                                                      43 Here I find works on gender and sexuality in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century America instructive. See, for example, Nayan Shah, Stranger Intimacy: Contesting Race, Sexuality, and the Law in the North American West, Ryan Lee Cartwright, Peculiar Places: A Queer Crip History of White Rural Nonconformity, and Peter Boag, Re-Dressing America’s Frontier Past. 44 Julio Capó, Jr., for example, has a revelatory chapter on bathing suits as sites of contests over white heteronormative femininity and sexuality, “Women and the Making of Miami’s Heterosexual Culture,” Welcome to Fairyland: Queer Miami before 1940, pg. 197-231.  21  queer methodologies expose the instabilities and historical contingencies or normalizing discourses.45 The Exler case and other instances of LGBTQ events in Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas illustrate how LGBTQ individuals were able to employ the legal logic of rights of private citizens against theme parks and their right to police visitors’ behavior. It underscores both the power of the right-to-privacy rhetoric and the willingness of LGBTQ activists to operate within the parameters of conservative discourses and logics to fight for inclusion. In order to locate any LGBTQ political traditions, it is useful to examine some of the early theories on gay and lesbian community and identity formation. In John D’Emilio’s essay on gay identity, he posits that gay identity only emerges after individuals began working for wages and subsisting on an income rather than through an “interdependent family unit,” placing them outside the confines of the heterosexual nuclear family.46 As work moved increasingly out of the private, family sphere and into the public, and as concentrated industrial labor pulled people to urban centers, the stage was set for “the formation of urban communities of lesbians and gay men” and “of a politics based on a sexual identity.”47 D’Emilio shows the historic emergence of explicit gay and lesbian identities in relation to capitalism in the United States order to debunk the ahistorical homosexual myth and to ease assumptions that gay and lesbian life was one of “silence, invisibility, and isolation” before the postwar era.48                                                      45 Here I am inspired by Colin R. Johnson’s summary of the power of normalizing discourses in Just Queer Folks: Gender and Sexuality in Rural America, pg. 3-4. 46 D’Emilio, “Capitalism and Gay Identity,” pg. 104-05. 47 D’Emilio, pg. 104. 48 D’Emilio, pg. 101. 22  Studying LGBTQ politics in the postwar era after the construction of collective gay and lesbian identities—and to a lesser extent, trans, bisexual, and queer—remains a relevant and necessary task for understanding the complexities of LGBTQ politics then and now. In the late-2000s and throughout the 2010s, scholars turned a critical eye toward the various LGBTQ political movements of the 1960s onward. In particular, scholars of this moment have worked to trace the various local, state, and federal pressures and events that led to the privileging of some forms of protest and activism over others, all the while excavating those lesser known, more radical political movements from obscurity. This history of LGBTQ protests and social gatherings in Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas joins the following scholarship by considering the ways in which vying for inclusion in theme parks from the late-1970s onward resulted in relatively limited, but still impactful gains.   Timothy Stewart-Winter’s Queer Clout, for example, examines the LGBTQ political movement in Chicago during the postwar era, tracing a trajectory “from the closet to the corridors of power.”49 His work focuses on the most visible gay rights activists in the city and contextualizes their rise to political prominence. Along the way, Stewart-Winter analyzes the racial constitution of the various gay rights organizers in relation to the heavily bifurcated city and the larger urban political machines and movements. Stewart-Winter maps the political activism of Chicago’s LGBTQ population onto the urban space itself to demonstrate how spatial and economic reorganization throughout the era simultaneously effected the shape and trajectory of political                                                      49 Stewart-Winter, Queer Clout: Chicago and the Rise of Gay Politics, pg. 1 23  organizing. White gay men activists continued to work in concert with local policing institutions and politicians at the cost of solidarity with Chicagoans of color and of lower classes. The city of Chicago and its most visible and vocal LGBTQ activists followed parallel trajectories: from the radical redistributive potentialities of the 1960s and 1970s to the deepening class, racial, and economic divides of the neoliberal 1980s onward. Christina Hanhardt explores a similar history of LGBTQ politics and its relationship to property, place, and violence in San Francisco and New York in Safe Space. Like Stewart-Winter, Hanhardt traces the rise of a particular style and method of LGBTQ activism born in the immediate postwar era that persisted throughout the twentieth century. This LGBTQ activism was centered on identities first and foremost, and activists like those in the homophile movement and later in the various anti-violence street patrols sought simultaneously to disaggregate homosexuality and gay identity from other criminal categories and to protect gay-identified people from violence and discrimination. While these activists may not have always worked alongside one another or in perfect concert together, Hanhardt argues that both strands of activism inevitably helped to shape the cultural and social geographies of their cities. By seeking to dissociate and subsequently protect gay and lesbian-identified men and women from violence and criminality as the city simultaneously succumbed to deepening racial and economic divides, LGBTQ activists helped buttress the growing power of policing institutions and their uneven persecution along racial and class lines.  Hanhardt argues that the methods and rhetoric of these LGBTQ activists of the 1980s and 1990s paralleled the growing property politics of the neoliberal moment, which had its roots in the suburbanization of the 1950s onward. While working alongside 24  local political systems and policing institutions may have seemed like a beneficial route for early LGBTQ politics, scholars like Hanhardt and Stewart-Winter have demonstrated the numerous consequences these alliances wrought on poorer communities of color. Other scholars have pointed out that these highly visible, urban LGBTQ identity politics were only one of the many political currents in motion during the latter half of the twentieth century. Emily Hobson’s Lavender and Red, for example, fills this historiographical gap and uncovers a host of LGBTQ political activists in the Bay Area who worked alongside more broad-based movements and organizations. As she states throughout her introduction, these activists eschewed the single-issue identity politics methods in favor of promoting solidarity with other groups at various local, national, and international levels. The resulting narrative shows both the many successes and tensions within and among this vast and diverse cohort of radical activists during the mid and late-twentieth century. This dissertation builds upon scholarship on LGBTQ politics, highlighting how legal victories in Disneyland and social gatherings in both parks constituted a small, but visible intersection between theme parks and the LGBTQ community.   The forms of protests and space-making that LGBTQ individuals utilized in Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland from the late-1970s onward borrowed from the methods and messaging of other gay and lesbian activist traditions that have since been criticized for their overreliance on narrow, rights-based identity politics. Cultural historian and Queer Studies scholar Lisa Duggan has been one of the most incisive and consistent critics of the gay rights movement in the neoliberal moment. In her essay on sexual politics in the 1980s and 1990s, she argues that the most vocal and visible 25  champions of gay rights represent “the new homonormativity.”50 This framework uncovers the brand of “politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions” and instead chooses to promote a “privatized, depoliticized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption.”51 Duggan’s scathing critique of gay sexual politics in the neoliberal moment echoes many of the concerns voiced by earlier scholars like Michael Warner. Like Duggan, Warner states that white, middle-class men and women persist in the most visible positions in political organizing because gay and lesbian “institutions of culture-building have been market-mediated: bars, discos, phone lines, resorts.”52 While Warner’s analysis relies too much on a narrow set of LGBTQ gathering spaces and interactions, it nonetheless is useful when considering how the theme park, as a public site predicated on consumerism, placed restrictions on the kinds of LGBTQ politics fomented within its gates.  My work also contends with queer readings and histories of specific geographies, building off of recent scholarship of the rural and suburban “turns.” LGBTQ history has had many spatial “turns” since its inception, with each turn unveiling new insights into the ways in which geography informs and is informed by queer lives and queer experiences. George Chauncey’s Gay New York is perhaps the best-known monograph on queer history, and rightfully so, as it establishes many of the theoretical and                                                      50 Duggan, The Twilight of Equality? Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack on Democracy, pg. 50. 51 Duggan, “The New Homonormativity: The Sexual Politics of Neoliberalism,” pg. 179. 52 Warner, Fear of a Queer Planet: Queer Politics and Social Theory, pg. xvi-xvii. 26  methodological foundations of the field.53 In his exploration of New York’s “sexual topography,” Chauncey shows how the city’s landscape was conducive to interracial and interclass socializing and sexual encounter. They congregated on city streets and in saloons and bathhouses, and in the process “reterritorialized the city in order to construct a gay city in the midst of (and often invisible to) the normative city.”54 By the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars were beginning to challenge the centrality of urban spaces and coastal cities to the queer experience and to LGBTQ history altogether. Although studies of gay and lesbian communities in urban centers would continue, they would increasingly incorporate the insights offered by scholars of the ‘rural turn’ in LGBTQ history, namely John Howard. Howard’s Men Like That explores the queer history of rural Mississippi throughout the mid and late-twentieth century. Like many of the scholars that follow, Howard’s main contention is that queer life was surprisingly vibrant in the rural South. Rather than limiting his study to men and women who explicitly identified as gay and lesbian, Howard uses oral histories to uncover a multiplicity of queer experiences in the rural South, and as Howard’s life stories show, the rural geography of Mississippi impacted queer lives in various ways.  One central feature of queer experiences in the rural landscape was the automobile. As Howard states, queer life in rural Mississippi, in contrast to the many of the stories of the queer life in urban regions, was dictated by circulation more so than                                                      53 Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy and Madeline D. Davis’s Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold: The History of a Lesbian Community is equally influential as an early history of lesbian subcultures in communities in urban New York. 54 Chauncey, Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940, pg. 23. 27  congregation. Queer men and women did meet in bars and other social centers in small towns and bigger cities, but even these queer encounters were predicated on mobility and colored by the vast distances between them. Howard incorporates both the journey and destination in his study, uncovering how cars, roads, and bars shaped queer lives in equal measure. These “arenas of circulation and congregation” were all spaces for queer encounters in the rural landscape.55 By the early-2010s, scholars recognized that in spite of the “rural turn” of the 1990s, there was still a sharp divide between urban and rural spaces in the cultural and queer imaginary, and to a lesser degree in LGBTQ scholarship and histories. Scott Herring’s Another Country is less a traditional history and more a work of cultural theory, but it is nonetheless instructive in outlining the ways in which the relationship between the urban and the rural is shaped with regard to queer experiences and histories. As Herring explains, in discourses of queer life and queer experience there exists an imagined trajectory wherein “the metropolis is the final destination point for queer kids of any gender, class, race, or region.”56 Like concentric circles, urban spaces are envisioned as the “epicenter of contemporary queer life,” with rural spaces occupying the outer edges; the hate-filled hinterlands of religious fundamentalism, conservatism, and “cultural and socioeconomic poverty.”57 For Herring, and for many of the scholars that followed, this imagined boundary between the urban and the rural, while discursively potent and pervasive, was exactly that: it was a historically produced border. This is not to deny the power that it has in                                                      55 Howard, Men Like That: A Southern Queer History, pg. 100-01. 56 Herring, Another Country: Queer Anti-Urbanism, pg. 4. 57 Herring, pg. 9. 28  shaping queer lives and queer memories. Herring argues that this affect, this “queer form of social death,” remains lodged in various discourses on sexuality and queer life.58 Colin Johnson locates this despair toward the rural queer experience in popular film and media representations of queer life. Johnson argues that Brokeback Mountain, for example, is a tragedy not because of the unrequited love narrative, but because “it deals with the theme of unrequited love between two men who live and work in rural Wyoming.”59 Johnson’s work expounds upon Herring’s foundation, bring a queer historicist framework to the rural landscape. Johnson uses queer historicism as both a theoretical lens with which to view a variety of non-normative performances, practices, and desires, and a methodological framework to bring new readings to old archival material. Johnson, like Herring, is careful to acknowledge that while differences exist between urban and rural histories and developments, the trouble arises when these differences are treated as strict and exact opposites. This tendency to treat the urban and rural as polar opposites in the queer and popular imaginary neutralizes “our awareness of power differentials by obscuring the fact that one term is almost always valorized in relation to the other.”60 Herring refers to this concept as “vulgar ruralism,” which imagines rural living as more authentic and urban living as inauthentic.61 These “binarisms” also homogenize cities and rural spaces, and they flatten difference and historical contingencies. Johnson and Herring reveal how ignoring the ways in which “binarisms” structure queer narratives and queer imaginaries can result in an impoverished understanding of the                                                      58 Herring, pg. 1. 59 Johnson, Just Queer Folks: Gender and Sexuality in Rural America, pg. 17. 60 Johnson, pg. 11. 61 Herring, pg. 26 29  rich queer histories of rural spaces. Their work presages in many ways one of the most recent spatial turns in LGBTQ studies which incorporates the suburbs into the spatial arrangement, expanding beyond the urban-rural divide and into the larger metropolitan landscape. And although their works are few and far between, suburban scholars like Karen Tongson and Clayton Howard have enriched the field of LGBTQ studies and space in numerous ways. Tongson’s work, in particular, follows in the footsteps of rural queer scholars by challenging our fundamental understanding of suburbia as devoid of queer experiences and queer stories. She, like Herring and Johnson, outlines the ways in which cultural and queer imaginaries reproduce spatial imaginaries and narratives where queer individuals acquire “a greater sense of pride, liberation, and safety” as they move from the “emotional, aesthetic, and physical” precarity of rural and suburban spaces to the sanctified urban center.62 Tongson argues that in the “meticulously planned geographies” of the suburbs, scholars must read against the grain and against the bevy of cultural products that “perpetuate the mythos” of suburbia and its “racialized, classed, and sexualized homogeneity” to find queer desires, identities, communities, and practices.63 She examines the lives of queer-identified comedians of color in the early-2000s in the suburbs of Los Angeles who use comedy as a “techne of survival” and a tool to assert themselves and their unlikely subjectivities into the suburban and queer imaginaries alike.64 I intervene by transposing her theories and arguments onto Disneyland and Six                                                      62 Tongson, Relocations: Queer Suburban Imaginaries, pg. 5. 63 Tongson, pg. 1-3. 64 Tongson, pg. 15. 30  Flags Over Texas, both of which are situated in the suburbs between two sprawling metropoles. Her insights inspire my own efforts to find queerness in the overtly heteronormative landscapes of theme parks.  The latter half of this dissertation inserts queer lives and queer perspectives into the histories of two of the most well-known American cultural products and tourist destinations in the world. It shows how the fight for LGBTQ inclusion throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s manifested in complex ways that were often contingent upon the surrounding geographic regions of the parks as well as the broader cultural presences and prestige of their brands and identities. It builds upon the previous chapters which outline the ways in which theme parks house and reproduced heteronormative and heteropatriarchal discourses in its theming and marketing. Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas featured historical narratives that celebrated rugged frontier life and the violence of US colonialism, which served to reinforce both gendered and racial boundaries and subjectivities for both park guests and those they employed. Taken together, the chapters that follow exhibit how theme parks have been both deeply heteronormative and queer landscapes simultaneously throughout history. Lastly, they build upon the scholarship on the history of Disneyland (again, one of the most well-known places on Earth), and demonstrate how a lesser-known theme park like Six Flags Over Texas can complicate or add nuance to Disney’s monolithic status in theme park histories. CHAPTER LAYOUT Chapter one situates Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas within the context of the postwar suburbanization of Anaheim and Arlington. It highlights the ways in which these two bedroom communities expanded geographically, demographically, and 31  economically starting in the 1950s and through to the 1970s. It also examines how the citizens of these two suburbs responded to the rapidly changing world around them, focusing on cultural contests and debates over the family and the child. Those changes as represented by the construction of theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas required huge capital investments and vast amounts of manpower to reshape the land. As such, these two theme parks were embodiments of a host of spatial and cultural changes occurring most visibly in the Sunbelt suburbs. Disneyland is the subject of chapter two. From its earliest stages of development, the park was meant to be a culmination of decades of brand-building for Walt Disney and the Disney company. By 1955, Disney was already a fixture of wholesome childhood entertainment in American culture, and consequently, Disneyland was already slated to be dedicated to that demographic. In the context of postwar suburbanization, the Disney brand and all it came to represent was effectively grafted onto the spatial and cultural logics of the suburbs. Both Disneyland and the suburbs were heralded as bastions of postwar American culture, typified by a retreat from the economic and social decay of the cities and toward the prosperity and promise of the suburbs. But these extensive economic and spatial changes sparked a longing for an imagined American past. Those competing desires—to return to a pastoral former America and to embrace the innovations of the future—were expressed most visibly through the theming and marketing of theme parks. Six Flags Over Texas drew inspiration from Disneyland in a number of ways, but, as chapter three uncovers, park promoters recognized that they needed to forge their own, unique, regional identity. The park chose to imbue its landscape, rides, and attractions 32  with elements of Texas’s history under the six flags. One consequence was that park planners had to balance a desire for historical authenticity with the necessity to entertain. The park reads as a celebration of America’s history of colonialism, and it features violence toward and stereotypes of racial minorities in equal measure. This nationalistic history is also heteropatriarchal. It reproduces heteronormative gendered scripts of intrepid, rugged, masculine cowboys in the US West and the like.  As chapter four illustrates, queering the theme park experience occasionally meant inserting gay and lesbian parents and families alongside their heterosexual counterparts. It situates these contests over space and acceptance in theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas within the broader context of LGBTQ politics in the Orange County and Dallas-Fort Worth regions. Doing so reveals how the messaging and methods found in theme park activism paralleled some of the most visible and vocal LGBTQ activist movements of the era—methods that relied on the image and rhetoric respectable, normative family unit. This chapter also explores how the two theme parks factored into the broader LGBTQ culture outside the park’s gates, illustrating how queer culture coopted these family-friendly brands in unique ways. These and other methods of queering the theme park experience sometimes entailed finding nuggets of non-normative behavior and performance within the theme park landscape, in spite of the simultaneous presence of family-friendly fun and entertainment. Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland are some of the most visible and enduring cultural products of the postwar era in America. They collectively host millions of guests annually from across the world, and they have been doing so since 1955 in the case of Disneyland and 1961 for Six Flags Over Texas. Moreover, both theme parks feature 33  characters and other branding products and paraphernalia that circulate through mass media and consumer markets to reach countless more. It is hard to quantify the scope and scale of these theme parks and their larger brands, but they are nonetheless omnipresent. As such, their ability to produce and shape knowledge and values cannot be underestimated. They are celebrated as landscapes dedicated to childhood—to a state of being that is often construed as an apolitical “embodiment of ‘nature’ outside culture.”65 When LGBTQ individuals claim space in these theme parks, they invariably challenge the discursive foundation of these sites and bring into sharp relief the very real and material ways in which the child and the theme park have functioned collectively in late-twentieth century American culture.                                                       65 Spigel, Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 251. 34  Chapter 1: Orange Groves and Cow Pastures: Suburbanization of Anaheim and Arlington   In July of 1959, journalist Elizabeth Carpenter of The Abilene Reporter-News in Abilene, Texas, published a series of articles titled the “Changing Face of Texas.” As the title suggests, Carpenter’s three-part piece on the recent history of Texas focused on a number of changes that the state and its people had undergone within the past fifteen years or so. The first article in the series revolves around “Mr. Texas,”—a personification of the state itself—who, by the late-1950s, had become a city slicker who “has moved his family to a suburb and traded his ole-hound dog for a dachshund who moved indoors with him.”1 The article outlines a series of demographic changes occurring within Texas’s recent past, namely the exponential growth of manufacturing and other industries; the influx of new residents from out-of-state; the state-wide shift away from rural and ranch living toward small-town and metropolitan living; and the consolidation of independent farms and ranches into larger, more corporatized structures. But the tone of the first half of Carpenter’s first article hints at a broader, underlying cultural change that coincides with these demographic shifts. As she states, Mr. Texas, “The big lanky fellow who once boisterously free-wheeled his luck in oil or cattle,” now works for a marketing and “reads the Wall Street Journal.”  Fittingly, Carpenter’s second article tells of the coming conversion of thousands of acres of pasturelands between Dallas and Ft. Worth “into a billion-dollar center for                                                      1 Elizabeth Carpenter, “Mr. Texas Is Changed Fellow,” The Abilene Reporter-News, July 19, 1959, pg. 9-B. 35  industry and amusements.”2 The centerpiece of this large development was the “75-acre Texas-type ‘Disneyland’.” The article describes the larger project as a combined effort of millionaires from the East and the Southwest—a surprisingly comfortable collaboration between the vaguely “Eastern” William Zeckendorf, Sr., and the decidedly Texan Angus Wynne, Jr. The two men and their cohort of investors were purchasing parcels of land from the estate of W. T. Waggoner, who had cultivated the region between the two cities into a lucrative horse breeding and racing region. The goal of these investors was to repurpose Waggoner’s former ranchland to accommodate the spread of new industries in the Dallas-Fort Worth region. Glen Turpin, the foreman of the Waggoner horse farm, is quoted in the second article regarding the land sell to Wynne, Jr., and the Great Southwest Corporation, where he concludes, “Well, I guess it’s time to spit on the fire and call the dogs.”3 For Turpin, as well as for Carpenter and her cast of characters in the article, the forthcoming industrial center and the “Texas Under Six Flags” amusement park were embodiments of these entangled economic and cultural shifts happening in Texas and across the Sunbelt region.  Whether these broader changes were for the better or not is a central theme throughout the three articles. In the first part, for example, Carpenter states that these changes are part of a natural and logical progression, bringing “prosperity and sophistication” at the cost of “the decline of highly individualistic oil or cattleman and the advance of a growing management class composed of both natives and newcomers.” By                                                      2 Carpenter, “Fort Worth, Dallas Get Together in Cow Pasture,” The Abilene Reporter-News, July 20, 1959, pg. 11-A. 3 This colloquial phrase basically meant that it was time to move on; that one’s time had come to pass. 36  the third article, Carpenter wonders out loud whether “the changing face of Texas [will] also change its personality and its people?”4 And the answer to this question, given through the speeches of various Texas politicians, is a resounding “maybe.” Lyndon B. Johnson, then a Senator for the state, warns that, “Unless we work diligently and promptly to give our Texas cities a special character of freedom, we shall see a great transformation of the Texas character in the years immediately ahead.” Johnson’s quote hinted at the anxieties some Texans had regarding the rapidly changing world around them. But, as previously mentioned, these anxieties coexisted with an equally powerful sense of anticipation and optimism about the possibilities of these coming economic and cultural transformations. In the Dallas-Fort Worth region in particular, these interlaced emotions would come to bear on Arlington and other suburbs of the area and their upcoming industrial and amusement center.    Carpenter’s series of articles detailing the changing landscape of the state of Texas signals the ambivalence that many people, both in Texas and elsewhere in these boom regions, expressed at these shifting economic, cultural, and political landscapes. At the end of part three, Carpenter concludes that it would “be a pity indeed if we should lose ourselves on our trek to town,” which highlights how, for many, the changes wrought by the reorientation of America’s economy toward large scale manufacturing extended beyond simple demographic shifts. Her commentary about ranchers-turned-suburbanites underscores how many people felt about Post-War urban sprawl and suburbanization, especially in the US South and Southwest. Emotions ranged from tepid                                                      4 Carpenter, “Face Changes; How About Personality?” The Abilene Reporter-News, July 21, 1959, pg. 2-B. 37  uneasiness to outright despair that the country’s trajectory was moving away from some of the core characteristics of America and toward something altogether unfamiliar. It was moving away from the America of Teddy Roosevelt’s “Strenuous Life” and toward the anemic “Centertons” and “Pleasantvilles” of post-war suburbia.5 Still, others welcomed these economic and cultural shifts with open arms, delighted by the promises of prosperity and ease wrought by the coming of suburbanization. Theme park developers, as this chapter will illustrate, capitalized on this capricious mix of postwar angst and exhilaration and created landscapes where both those yearning for the past and those embracing the future could find joy and, perhaps more importantly, spend money.  This chapter situates both theme parks—Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, Texas—within the histories of their respective metropolitan regions. Both Anaheim and Arlington experienced rapid population growth and industrial expansion during the 1950s and into the 1960s, coinciding with, and in some ways thanks to the arrival of their newfangled amusement centers. Their exponential postwar growth brought with it the very same combination of apprehension and excitement in its citizens over the ever-changing world immediately around them. These entangled emotions found expression through various cultural institutions, both old and new. As one of the newest cultural institutions, theme parks were highly visible symbols of both local, regional, and eventually national attitudes toward postwar economic and cultural changes.                                                       5 “Democracity,” Your World of Tomorrow, New York World’s Fair, cited in A Consumers’ Republic: The Politics of Mass Consumption in Postwar America, Lizabeth Cohen, 2003, pg. 195. 38  The sudden spread of these suburbs also required extensive changes to the very land around them. Theme parks, likewise, necessitated a major reconfiguration of the land and infrastructure of their surrounding regions. One article from The Gilmer Mirror in 1961 states that Six Flags Over Texas, for example, required “the relocation of over 250,000 yards of dirt” alone. Developers also carved “a 3,000,000-gallon capacity lake” and a “50,000,000-gallon reservoir” into the Arlington pastureland.6 Both theme parks and the suburbs themselves were monumental construction projects that reshaped the land around them. They, similarly, both underscore the centrality of physical landscapes and space in conversations of postwar changes. Most conversations about both theme parks and suburbs celebrated these colossal landscaping projects as symbols of the progress of American industry and ingenuity. Others, especially from the 1960s onward, critiqued the suburbs and occasionally theme parks for veritably destroying the land around them. In 1966, for example, writer Cyril Northcote Parkinson argued that the “‘middle-class Utopia’ of the suburbs destroys the city and despoils the countryside.”7 Another journalist in 1972 mocked early environmental activists who claimed that the “Disneyland project ‘ruins’ natural environments.”8 This comment reveals that for much of the 1950s through to the 1970s, critics decrying the environmental impacts of suburbs and theme parks were fighting an uphill battle against boosters and the general public alike who saw these projects as worth the cost of their development.                                                      6 “’Six Flags Over Texas’ Fabulous,” The Gilmer Mirror, Gilmer, Texas, June 29, 1961, pg. 12. 7 Quoted in, “Parkinson and his Law,” David Lindsey, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, October 30, 1966, pg. 35. 8 “ ‘Original’ Disneyland Still Clean, Bright Fun,” Roger Swanson, The Kansas City Star, Kansas City, Missouri, June 25, 1972, pg. 9B. 39  Perhaps like the changing face of Texas, theme parks seemed like the next step; the natural consequence of increased space and spending come to bear on American leisure more broadly and amusement parks more specifically. The relative success of the Disneyland project in Anaheim, California in 1955 may have cemented this trend toward the theme park in postwar America in the minds of many Americans, but as this chapter will show, the theme park arose out of and developed alongside a very particular set of postwar cultural and economic trends. Paramount to the theme park’s development was the postwar trend of suburbanization, both in terms of the physical and spatial sense, and in a broader cultural and thematic sense. This chapter focuses on the host of economic, social, cultural, and spatial changes occurring in Anaheim and Arlington in order to better understand the interconnectedness of these two regions and their corresponding theme parks in the context of the 1950s and beyond.     Prior to the arrival of Disneyland in the mid-1950s, Anaheim was a largely rural agricultural center. Anaheim began as a German immigrant settlement and vineyard colony in 1857, twenty-one years before incorporation, and although the area remained largely rural, by the early-1920s it was becoming the center of citrus for the United States. It persisted as an agricultural hub in the Southern California region throughout the 1930s, although it, like many similar rural agricultural regions of its time, felt the squeeze of the Great Depression and the ensuing decade of economic hardships. Unfortunately, to add to its troubles, by the early-1940s, an unknown ailment colloquially called “quick decline,” “quick collapse,” or “sudden decline” ravaged citrus groves throughout the region, putting a dent into Southern California’s economy and overall hold on the citrus 40  market from the region.9 Farmers would continue to combat “quick decline” for the next two decades, necessitating new strategies and approaches to help the now-small-town Anaheim to recover. In the aftermath of WWII, town promotors and legislators sought to reorient the region’s economy away from its reliance on citrus and other crops and toward a more diverse set of industries. They capitalized on the decaying value of farmland and on the rapid growth of nearby Los Angeles to sell Anaheim as a bedroom community of the broader metropolitan area. In order to meet the growth goals of promoters and to compete with neighboring rural and suburban enclaves, Anaheim officials recognized that land was their most valuable asset, and consequently the most hotly contested. An article from the Anaheim Gazette in late November of 1955 detailed a resolution passed in a special session of the Anaheim City Council to promote and circulate petitions regarding the possible annexation of approximately 1120 acres of agricultural and residential land. This seemingly mundane council meeting on town borders was one of many in response to the growing hostility between the city of Anaheim and its neighbors to the north and south, Buena Park and Stanton.10 Throughout the mid-1950s, representatives from their                                                      9 “Orange Trees’ Sudden Death New Problem,” The San Bernardino County Star, (San Bernardino, California), January 14, 1943, pg. 17. “Quick decline” remained a regional issue throughout the 1940s and 1950s, but by 1959, farmers were effectively able to quarantine large sections of California’s citrus groves. See “Quick Decline Disease Hits County Orange Groves,” Ventura County Star-Free Press, (Ventura, California), November 18, 1959, pg.1. 10 Stanton was disincorporated in 1924 but was reincorporated in 1956. The community’s desire to reincorporate may help to explain why these expansions from Buena Park and Anaheim were so hotly contested. 41  respective cities fought in a series of contested annexations and incorporations to pull more and more people and acreage into their orbit.  Writers at the Anaheim Gazette spelled it out most clearly in a headline from an article in early March of 1956 which claimed, “Anaheim Victorious in 2 Annexation Elections” over Buena Park and Stanton.11 The rhetoric of press coverage of expansions and annexations spoke to a sense of competition born of the concurrent prosperity of the suburbs dotting the greater Orange County region. If Anaheim was going to continue to be “victorious” over its neighbors in its efforts to grow and expand, it would need to convince individual communities and residents that the town had something to offer to offset the relative autonomy of remaining unincorporated. Alternatively, town promoters would have to attract new businesses and industries with more economic and political muscle to sway residents.  Although some contribute the rapid growth of Anaheim in the 1950s to the arrival of Disneyland in 1955, it is clear that as early as 1953, Anaheim was shifting toward a growth-oriented model of city planning. Throughout the early-1950s, the Anaheim Gazette published articles praising the city for leading the Orange County in building and construction metrics. Interestingly enough, most of these articles refer to lands outside of the boundaries of Anaheim as “unincorporated” or “rural” Anaheim. In other words, the actual land that Anaheim’s early promoters pointed to to signal their forthcoming growth did not actually belong to Anaheim, although it seemed to be a common practice to lay                                                      11 “Anaheim Victorious in 2 Annexation Elections,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 8, 1956, pg. 1. 42  claim to surrounding unincorporated lands.12 Anaheim promoters’ use of the term “rural” alone illustrates partly how they envisioned Anaheim as a city on the rise, or at least a city sizeable enough to have rural areas in its orbit. The Anaheim Chamber of Commerce published an equally optimistic forecast of Anaheim’s growth potential in September of 1954. The Chamber of Commerce alleged that Anaheim’s population would double within the next few years, citing tentative annexations and plans for new housing tracts in 1955 and beyond. The report also stated that Anaheim had eight industrial plants employing over one hundred employees; sixty-one plants employing less than one hundred; and a host of forthcoming plants that would add another 700-plus jobs to the area.13    For some residents, the vote for annexation seemed to be a formality or inevitability in the face of Anaheim’s ever-expanding borders.14 Even for those who, as Anaheim City Administrator Keith Murdoch states, “did not want to become ‘city folk’,” it was hard to stay out of the path of Anaheim’s growth.15 But by and large, it appeared as though most residents in unincorporated or unannexed areas were more than happy to vote for annexation when the time came and to bank on the continued prosperity of the city of Anaheim.16 In September of 1955, it was reported that an estimated 1407 acres of                                                      12 “Anaheim Leads County Building,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 23, 1953, pg. 1. 13 “Doubling of Anaheim’s Population is forecast by Chamber of Commerce,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, September 9, 1954, pg. 1. 14 Another annexation in December of 1955 mentions that the proposed land was, at the time, almost totally surrounded by the city already, “Ball Rd. Residents To Vote Annexation,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, December 8, 1955, pg. 1. 15 “Council Takes Initial Action”. 16 A quick survey of articles regarding annexation from 1955-1959 shows more cases where residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of annexation than not. Annexation was 43  former orange grove had been replaced by other developments in the first six months of the year alone. Subdividers purchased most of the land—approximately 1300 acres—with the remaining 100 acres or so being divided up between business, churches, amusements, and other infrastructural projects.17 Despite the fact that by the end of the decade, the region’s agronomists had seemed to have the “quick decline” issue under control, Anaheim was already pivoting away from agriculture and toward a mixed economy. Annexations and land use redesignations were part and parcel of a more diverse local suburban economy, but not all area residents were ready to play ball with town promoters and legislators.   Anaheim’s rapid expansion necessitated the expanding of municipal services and consequently the expanding of local taxes throughout the 1950s. By 1958, at least, Anaheim residents were engaging with growing anti-federal tax sentiments, although this anti-federal spending fervor would not reach a fever pitch until the mid-1970s. In August of 1958, for example, the Anaheim Rotary Club hosted a representative from the National Association of Manufacturers who warned of excess federal spending and the ever-increasing taxes it would incite. Citing the recent period of inflation and President Eisenhower’s remarks on the matter, the spokesperson concluded that people by and large were too optimistic regarding federal spending. The solution, then, was to eliminate new federal programs and cut back on existing programs—precisely which programs was                                                      rarely unanimous, though. In fact, an article from June 18, 1959 declares that Anaheim had its first unanimous annexation vote, 21 for, 0 against. “Voters Unanimous On New Annexation, Anaheim Gazette, pg. 1.  17 “Survey Shows Housing is Gobbling up Orange Groves,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, September 22, 1955, pg. 1. 44  left to the audience’s imagination—and to promote local and state spending instead.18 And that seemed to be the prevailing sentiment throughout the 1950s for most Anaheim residents. The need for new schools, hospitals, and other municipal services and infrastructural fixes, particularly those to the city’s continuing sewage problem, meant that the issue of local taxation was always on the forefront of Anaheim’s citizens’ mind, but reports in July of 1958 maintained that Orange County overall had one of the lowest tax rates per capita out of the entire state.19 Local elected officials likewise typically ran on a platform of tax reduction. In 1958, for example, city councilors A. J. Schutte and Glenn Fry won re-election after promising that their new financing plan for children’s parks and playgrounds would not result in a tax increase.20 Even candidates that failed to win election canvassed on a platform that promised frugality with tax dollars while simultaneously promising to keep pace with city growth, as well as vague assurances to prevent special interest variances in the city.21 This tension between pro-expansion and anti-tax impulses would continue to inform local policies and shape the political and cultural landscape of Anaheim and other nearby neighborhoods of northwest Orange County. Throughout the mid-1950s, it appeared as though representatives and city planners were continuously testing the literal                                                      18 “Government Spending Won’t Bring About Everlasting Prosperity,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, August 28, 1958, pg. 1. 19 “Orange County Is One Of Lowest Taxing Counties In California,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, July 17, 1958, pg. 1. 20 “Good Government Is Endorsed,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, April 4, 1958, pg. 5. 21 See for example, “An Open Letter To All Anaheim Citizens Regarding My Platform,” by Leo Harpin, Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, April 3, 1958, pg. 8, “Robert S. Borden’s Six-Point Platform,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 20, 1958, pg. 1.  45  boundaries of Anaheim’s postwar growth. They mobilized to annex territories, occasionally doing so preemptively, much to the chagrin of the new unofficial citizens of Anaheim. As the region expanded, however, officials had to continuously answer to the demands of their increasingly politically conservative constituents.    Many scholars write about the “Disneyfication” of cities and towns in the late-twentieth century, where they outline the ways in which, among other things, Disneyland’s sheer control of space influences the ways cities and towns are structured or restructured around consumption in our contemporary moment.22 But it is equally fruitful to consider the ways in which the tools and techniques of city planning and expansion influenced Disneyland’s design and trajectory. While Walt Disney originally selected the location for his dream park because of a number of economic feasibility factors, he also chose Anaheim on an ideological basis. Here, residents were fighting to preserve a culture and way of life that they felt was slipping away. Whether or not this imagined culture existed in the first place was a nonfactor. In the wake of government subsidized suburbanization, more and more people could afford to turn their anti-urban fantasies into reality. As such, it is useful to examine what the burgeoning suburban cultural landscape in Anaheim looked like to better understand the parallels between the mores and values of suburbanites in Orange County and the themes of the Disneyland park.    During this era of Anaheim’s postwar expansion, James B. Utt served as representative to the US House of Representatives for Orange County, and as much as any elected official represents the sentiments of their constituents, Utt was staunchly                                                      22 See for example Alan Bryman’s The Disneyization of Society, 2004. 46  conservative on all fronts. Utt regularly published updates from Washington in the Anaheim Gazette, where he railed against everything from labor unions to books about America’s burial business.23 In one article from August of 1958, for example, Utt accused the Democrats and their labor union allies of attempting “to destroy the American system of free enterprise and to Sovietize this country.” He also parroted the sentiments of Senator McClellan who stated that labor unions represented “a new form of slavery—insidious, semisecret and sinister.”24 Utt worked throughout his tenure—from 1953 until his death in 1970—to speak out against the US’s involvement in the United Nations; to lambast the Democrats for unscrupulous spending; to promote withdrawal from nuclear disarmament agreements with other nations; and to push for what he called the “Liberty Amendment,” which would remove the federal government from all activities not expressly listed in the Constitution, among other things.25 He was also an advocate for the Liberty Lobby, whose inflammatory pamphlets ran the gamut from standard political smear campaigns against Democratic candidates to outright Holocaust denial and other white nationalist conspiracy theories.26 In November of 1963, Utt came under fire for alleging that “a large contingent of barefooted Africans” were in Cuba to                                                      23 “Utt Attacks Author Of Book on Funerals,” Progress-Bulletin, Pomona, California, October 18, 1963, pg. 2. 24 “Congressman James B.

They also included quotes from a number of citizens praising his tenacity when fighting for their “God given constitutional rights and freedom.”29 Utt was by and large locally celebrated for his work on behalf of Orange County in part due to his ability to consistently appease the voting public. Sometimes, appeasing the public meant stoking anti-communist fears and other such sentiments; it meant convincing voters that various aspects of American democracy and free enterprise were under assault; and sometimes, it just meant securing enough funding so that Orange County citizens had options when parking their mini yachts.30 James B. Utt’s rhetoric and policy efforts reflected broader social, political, economic, and cultural sentiments in Orange County and other similar suburban clusters                                                      27 “Utt Concedes UN Takeover Report Errors,” The Sacramento Bee, Sacramento, California, November 14, 1963, pg.

This new conservatism blended a classic Protestant moralism and political libertarianism the likes of which had been seen before in the Depression era, but the circumstances of the postwar moment added new cultural dimensions to the burgeoning conservative movement. Unlike its predecessor in the 1930s, this new era of political and cultural conservatism attracted a younger crowd of new homeowners moving to the suburbs. As such, this new populist movement was born out of economic prosperity and affluence resulting from the government spending and subsidies that created the postwar suburbs.  Representative Utt was a firebrand conservative, and he and those of his ilk were gaining increasing popularity in the suburbs of Orange County, but national electoral politics are only one lens through which we can view the beliefs and concerns of the residents of Anaheim. A quick survey of issues of the Anaheim Gazette and other local periodicals published between 1953 and 1959 helps to give a sense of what cultural, social, and political concerns and stories were pervasive in mid-century Anaheim. As this next section reveals, readers of Anaheim’s local publications were exposed to an equal mix of alarmist news bulletins about various kinds of threats—both far away and in their own backyard—and simple anecdotes of bucolic small-town life. These stories were emblematic of broader postwar trends in print media and periodicals, but they nonetheless give a glimpse of the quotidian concerns of this distinct Sunbelt suburb of Anaheim.  One constant news story throughout the 1950s—and the latter-half of the twentieth century—was coverage of looming communist threats abroad and at home. An editorial from the Anaheim Bulletin in 1955 spelled it out plainly, warning that 49  “Communism, of course, is the world’s clear and present danger.”31 Peaking toward the tail end of the Korean War, and then fizzling out by the end of the decade, articles regularly discussed various plans and schemes of “commies” and “reds”. The tone of these articles, as with most coverage of communism from journalists in the United States, vacillated between alarmist and disparaging. Residents of Anaheim engaged locally with the issue of communism through numerous civic organizations whose missions were admittedly often larger than taking on communism alone. In 1953, for example, citizens of Anaheim participated in a donation drive through the local Lions Club to help fund the US government’s resettlement program titled “Operation Philippines”.32 Similarly, in November of 1953, the Anaheim Citizens’ Committee of the Anaheim Union High School voted to censor or outright ban books “on governments and beliefs of those opposed to the American way of life,” with books “glorifying socialism or communism” drawing the most criticism.33  The discursive power of the communist threat was in its ability to change and morph to fit an ever-growing number of contexts. On the national level, the threat of communism precipitated a host of knee-jerk reactions to various social movements and other economic, cultural, and political changes that were cast as un-American throughout the 1950, 1960s, and 1970s in particular. Small towns and suburbs in America rarely encountered actual dyed-in-the-wool communists or anything to that effect, but the risk                                                      31 “Eternal Vigilance,” Anaheim Bulletin, July 6, 1955, pg. 11.  32 “Leavitt Ford Named Chairman of District’s ‘Operation Philippines’,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 30, 1953, pg. 1. 33 “Citizens’ Group Votes to Control AUHS Materials,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, November 5, 1953, pg. 1. 50  of reds played into suburbanites’ image of themselves and their way of life as under assault. While it is hard to quantify the exact ramifications of small-town fears of communism, it served as a perpetual enemy to the people of Anaheim, who increasingly envisioned themselves as a bastion against it and other more nebulous enemies. They railed against everything from the media to local social groups and civic organizations for assaulting the “traditional American way of life,” or for promoting “the benefits of change and ‘modernism’…without…an appreciation and understanding of the basic foundations of our country.”34 Oftentimes, though, this communist fear manifested in clear and deliberate attacks against Democrats and other politicians at the local, state, and national level. In 1962, Orange County conservatives helped organize the Committee to Combat Communism and co-author Proposition 24 to amend the California State Constitution to forbid “advocates of subversive doctrines” from holding public office among other things.35 Moreover, this fear regularly compelled parents to take proactive steps to engage their kids in anti-communist activities, and more broadly to protect them from a host of cultural menaces. The censoring and removal of pro-communist or “anti-American” books from high school libraries is a great example of Anaheim parents mobilizing to protect the youth. Likewise, in 1961, the Orange County School of Anti-Communism held a Youth Day at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.36 This anti-communist sentiment materialized in a number of ways in Anaheim’s school districts specifically and in the                                                      34 Unnamed commentator, “Our Traditional Christmas Must Be Preserved,” Magnolia Way, December 1963, quoted in McGirr, Suburban Warriors, pg. 69. 35 Quoted in McGirr, Suburban Warriors, pg. 79. 36 “Anti-Red School Lists Youth Day,” Anaheim Gazette, February 23, 1961, pg. 3. 51  broader youth and family culture throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Toward the tail end of the 1960s, for example, parents and students drew increasing connections between sex education efforts in schools and communist perversion. They revolted against Family Life and Sex Education curriculum in their schools, successfully removing them by 1970.37 What this illustrates is the power and pliability of anti-communist rhetoric and belief in Anaheim throughout the postwar era. The fact that Anaheim’s Family Life and Sex Education courses were popular during the early 1960s and fell out of favor by the end of the decade, however, suggests that anti-communist fears were rarely the sole factor influencing local policies about child welfare and education, in particular. It was only toward the end of the decade that sex education came to be understood as a threat wrapped up in anti-communist concerns about state-ran education rather than a public good.  Anaheim area publications offset their articles about communism and other cultural threats with an abundance of local stories reaffirming the placid, small-town feel of its community. One matter that received near-constant coverage in the Anaheim Gazette was the matter of marriage. Most issues throughout the 1950s included one or more articles discussing Anaheim residents getting married or going planning honeymoon excursions. One issue from September of 1953 included no less than five separate articles congratulating citizens of the city on their nuptials, and some even included detailed descriptions of the ceremony, outfits of the bridal parties, and short lists                                                      37 For more on the interconnectedness of sex education and anti-communist rhetoric, see Natalia Mehlman Petrzela’s “Sex Education and the Unmaking of Anaheim’s ‘Golden Age,’” Classroom Wars: Language, Sex, and the Making of Modern Political Culture, 2015, pg. 131-157. 52  of attendees.38 These articles reassured readers that despite the rapid growth of the town around them, Anaheim was still a town of close-knit neighbors invested in the lives of everyone on their block. They also foregrounded heteronormative love and romance and helped to ensure their continued centrality in the suburban neighborhoods of Anaheim. These articles served to create an imagined community of heteronormative families and lovers, providing assurance in a time when the world seemed to be changing at a breakneck and potentially alienating pace. Parent-teacher associations in Anaheim and in surrounding school districts received entire pages worth of print coverage in the Anaheim Gazette throughout the 1950s. Naturally, these organizations are the most visible organization at the intersection of the child and the family in Anaheim during this era, so it is worthwhile to survey the various issues they tackled and the methods and rhetoric they used to address problems in their schools and communities. Leisure and free time were increasingly becoming concerns of parents in the post-war moment. One p-ta meeting focused on occupying children in their free time with productive hobbies like gardening, oil painting, ceramics, and other such artistic activities. As the theme of “Strengthening Fabric of the Family Through Hobbies” suggests, parents were searching for hobbies that the whole family could share.39 Parents of the Fremont PTA and other school groups were similarly on                                                      38 See, for example, “Marilyn Murn, Paul Freeman Wed In St. Boniface Rites Saturday,” “Marjorie Schutte Weds Stockton Man in UC Chapel Rites Sept. 12,” “Roland, Hornbys make New Home In Newport Following Honeymoon,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, September 24, 1953, pg 2-3. 39 “Magnolia P-TA Has Family Pot-Luck,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 14, 1953, pg. 3. 53  guard throughout the early-1950s for drugs and narcotics in their schools and neighborhoods.  In the article, Anaheim’s police lieutenant Tommy Taylor in quoted arguing that “Most of our illegal narcotics in Southern California come from Communist controlled China through Mexico.”40 Although Anaheim only had “one or two heroin addicts” in the entire city, according to Lieutenant Taylor, PTA members were urged to remain vigilant to keep the issue from becoming a pervasive one in their schools and neighborhoods.41 Taylor’s comments illustrate how, as argued above, community members invoked the threat of communism to accomplish a broad range of goals. More often than not, these goals involved protecting children in particular. Taylor’s comments also reveal how this nascent culture war was fueled by misinformation at various levels and scales. The enemy was international in nature, but the solution was decidedly local. According to the escalating rhetoric of Taylor and others, Anaheim parents had to be unceasingly vigilant for outside threats infiltrating their community and corrupting the wide-eyed youth.   At the vanguard of this conflict were Anaheim’s mothers and wives. As with many burgeoning suburban communities in the 1950s, women formed social clubs and participated in numerous civic organizations, often in their roles as wives and mothers of their neighborhoods. The early-1950s featured newspaper sections dedicated to women’s particular issues in the home and to these new suburban social clubs. In the Anaheim Gazette, these columns were written under the “Home-Makers’ Forum,” where staff                                                      40 “Fremont PTA Hears Talk on Dope Problem,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, December 3, 1953, pg. 8. 41 “Fremont PTA Hears Talk on Dope Problem.” 54  writer Joan S. White would publish tips and tricks for a happy home. The article from the first issue of the new year in 1953 is telling in that it includes a set of questions that readers should ask to assess their previous year. Among the questions to consider are: “Were you wholly satisfied with your social and religious life? Have you accepted your responsibilities as a member of community? Are you making your marriage work so that you and friend husband have grown closer with the passing of another year and have more interests in common?”42 The questions continue, but these above give a quick summary of the duties and expectations of married women in particular in the Anaheim region at the start of the new year in 1953. Although social clubs, parent-teacher organizations and other civic auxiliaries were not inherently gendered, it is clear from their coverage in newspapers like the Anaheim Gazette that women were the primary members and organizers of these community groups. So much so, that by 1959, the Anaheim Gazette section dedicated to covering social clubs changed its title from the ambiguous “Social and Club Activities” to the less cryptic “This Is A Woman’s World.” Parent-teacher organizations similarly hosted “Father’s Night” and other such events highlighting the men in the families, but the need to designate specific nights to celebrate or spotlight fathers suggests that women were quintessential p-ta members.43 One article covering an upcoming “Fathers’ Night” stated that “the ladies of the official board will turn over their duties to their husbands,”                                                      42 “Home-Makers’ Forum,” Joan S. White, Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 6, 1953, pg. 3. 43 “Magnolia P-TA Has Family Pot-Luck,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 14, 1953, pg. 3. This assumption is easily buttressed by the fact that the “Mrs.” moniker dominates in every article covering p-ta activity throughout this era.  55  once again reaffirming that women were typically the governing members of parent-teacher groups.44 These gendered parents’ programs extended beyond the scope of parent-teacher organizations and social clubs and into other facets of Anaheim’s civic culture. The Anaheim Park and Recreation Department, for example, hosted a series of events during the tail end of 1956 that aimed to attract area wives and mothers in particular. Among the activities were a “Homemaker Volleyballers” event; an ongoing “Slim and Trim” fitness class; and a “Housewife’s Day Out” program, where guest speakers would discuss “hair styling, fashion show, laws that housewifes [sic] should know, the cheaper cuts of meat,” and lastly, “interior decorating and linens.”45 These events reinforced gendered expectations for women that centered on life in the home. Even as they encouraged women to leave the house and participate in community events and activities, they remained decidedly structured around women’s roles as proper wives and mothers. Anaheim area men also enjoyed their fair share of options for social clubs and civic organizations throughout the 1950s. In 1956, residents established the Anaheim chapter of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America, where men were encouraged to join regardless of talent. Secretary Pat Patterson stated that, “you don’t have to be a Bing Crosby or a Perry Como, all you need is a desire to join other men in some good old-fashioned harmony.”46 Men’s social                                                      44 “Husbands Take Over at PTA ‘Fathers’ Night’,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, November 12, 1953, pg. 8. 45 “City Park Dept. Offering Activities For Local Women,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, November 1, 1956, pg. 6. 46 “SPEBSQUA Group Singers, Meet Fri. Need More Men,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 1, 1956, pg. 1. 56  clubs, while present in Anaheim, were less pervasive than women’s social clubs in the area. This trend signaled that men of the community were expected to be occupied with work in their roles as fathers and breadwinners. Alternatively, the lack of men’s social clubs suggested that they were predisposed to participate in public civic life without the necessity of a social club to facilitate that action. As many scholars have established, parent-teacher organizations and social clubs regularly blurred the lines between public and private—lines that were arguably becoming starker in the post-war moment in the suburbs.47 In 1953, for example, members of the Anaheim Council of Parents and Teachers hosted a founders day celebration at the home of Miss E. Kate Rea. Organization women invited members of the p-ta and members of the local press into their private homes to celebrate the occasion.48 This practice of women bringing the public into the private domicile was partly a vestige of Victorian-era division of spheres. Although, as countless scholars have demonstrated, women entered the public sphere via the factories and assembly plants of the WWII home front, they were muscled out of those jobs once men returned to the states from war. The postwar era, then, was characterized by women’s often-uneasy transition back to the private sphere. Many social clubs and civic organizations in Anaheim and surrounding areas operated through the auspices of the region’s numerous Protestant and Evangelical                                                      47 See McGirr, Suburban Warriors, and Stacy Taranto’s “Defending ‘Women Who Stand by the Sink’: Suburban Homemakers and Anti-ERA Activism in New York State,” Making Suburbia, pg. 36-50. 48 “Anaheim P-TA Council Marks Founder’s Day with Charming Tea At Home of Miss E. Kate Rea,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 25, 1953, pg. 3. 57  Christian churches. The Anaheim Home Department regularly met at the Evangelical United Brethren church or at the White Temple Methodist church in neighboring Garden Grove to discuss things like “tree pruning, pest control and the fundamentals of fertilization and irrigation.”49 The Anaheim chapter of the Ikettes—a women’s auxiliary of the Izaak Walton League of America—petitioned Senator Clinton P. Anderson in 1955 to halt plans on the Echo Dam project, urging him to keep “national parks and national monuments in their natural state, so that future generations may enjoy them as the Lord intended.”50 Parent-teacher organizations likewise infused religious rhetoric and ceremony to varying degrees in their meetings throughout the 1950s. In 1953, for example, Rev T. Eugene Coffin moderated a panel discussing issues, “such as use of the family car, dating, finances, homework, and whether parents are too inquisitive,” with parents and students of Anaheim Union High School.51   These brief examples demonstrate the interconnectedness of social and civic life and Protestant and Evangelical Christianity in Anaheim and the Sunbelt suburbs more broadly.52 Part of the allure of Protestant and Evangelical religions lay in aforementioned anti-communist sentiments, given that the Soviet Union was notoriously an atheistic                                                      49 “Anaheim Home Department Learns To Garden from Joe Littlefield,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, January 29, 1953, pg. 3. 50 “Re bill 2. 500,” letter from Mrs. Emma J. Lawrence of the Anaheim Ikettes to Senator Clinton P. Anderson, February 16, 1955, published in “Colorado River Storage Project” presented to the House Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation, 1955, pg. 729. 51 “Parent-Teen-Ager’s Problems Discussed at AUHS P-TA Meeting,” Anaheim Gazette, January 29, 1953, pg. 3. 52 This trend would continue throughout the twentieth century, manifesting most clearly in suburban megachurches as explained by Charity R. Carney in “Sanctifying the SUV: Megachurches, the Prosperity Gospel, and the Suburban Christian,” Making Suburbia, pg. 240-257. 58  society. Religious rhetoric and religious institutions also continued to buttress social and cultural appeals to protect the youth, such as in grassroots anti-obscenity efforts in the late-1960s.53 But as with the earlier examples of anti-communist rhetoric in battles over sex education, the many Protestant and Evangelical Christian denominations in Anaheim and similar suburbs, like Arlington, assured that although there may have been a vocal majority in these localized debates over the child and the family, there was a diversity of methods and messaging in the various churches from the 1950s onward.54 Anaheim’s residents mobilized throughout the mid and late-1950s through social clubs, civic organizations, religious institutions, and parent groups to create a wholesome community environment for themselves and their children. They sought to establish boundaries between their children and the vast and threatening world encircling their bucolic neighborhoods. In doing, they exercised a stunning degree of agency and control over the local political, cultural, and physical landscape throughout this era and into the remainder of the twentieth century. As their small town expanded in all directions around them, Anaheim’s men and women in their roles as mothers, fathers, and citizens marshalled likeminded suburbanite neighbors together to form a capable political collective at the local, regional, and eventually national level. In Anaheim, this veritable movement began in the living rooms and church halls but would soon spread to town hall meetings and legislatures and beyond.                                                       53 McGirr, pg. 227. 54 Robert O. Self makes this argument for the diversity of religious denominations and their influences on the rhetoric of family values clear in All in the Family, pg. 9. 59  As their influence grew, Anaheim citizens combatted more nebulous forms of countercultural incursions throughout the post-war era. In 1959, for example, the Anaheim City Council proposed an ordinance to place coffee shops within city limits under direct control of the council. The proposal stated that café proprietors offering any kind of live entertainment would have to acquire a special permit from the City Council or the Anaheim police department. Police Chief Mark Stephenson commented that Anaheim was “getting so large that we want to keep tabs on the type of entertainment offered here.”55 These regulations were meant to dissuade the establishment of coffee shops, which were frequented by men and women of the “beat generation.”56 A similar city ordinance from 1957 made it to where business owners had to secure permits to allow dancing in their establishments. Dancing in general and dance halls more specifically were of particular concern to parents of teenagers. As later examples of Disneyland’s Videopolis and Knott’s Berry Farm’s Studio K. will illustrate, these concerns over teen dancing and fraternizing had specific racial implications, as well.57 Oftentimes, as these stories illustrate, concerns over countercultural incursions came to bear on the physical landscape of the city. In 1959, city councilors denied a request for a                                                      55 “City Eyes Regulations to Discourage Location of ‘Beat’ Coffee Houses Here,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, September 3, 1959, pg. 1. 56 Members of surrounding cities also co-opted the aesthetics of the beatnik counterculture in themed parties, which illustrates a broader trend throughout history of abating gendered cultural anxieties through parody and play. The Tarzana Junior Women’s Club and the San Pedro Junior Woman’s Club held such parties in 1960 and 1959 respectively. “’Expresso’ Party Set,” The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, October 23, 1960, pg. 10, “Bouillabaise Meaning Defined,” San Pedro News-Pilot, San Pedro, California, November 7, 1959, pg. 6. 57 See Karen Tongson’s “Behind the Orange Curtain,” Relocations: Queer Suburban Imaginaries, pg.71-111. 60  local Anaheim man to build a cocktail bar on the east side of Euclid Street after numerous residents spoke out against the measure.58 Residents of Anaheim carried their preconceptions about space, race, and propriety with them to the suburbs and worked endlessly to police private businesses’ access to their neighborhoods and families. Histories of residents—particularly white suburbanites—exercising both de fact and de jure control over their neighborhoods and, by extension, their local municipalities in the postwar era are well-catalogued in the historiography.59 As noted in many works, neighborhoods became battlegrounds over not just physical space, but over belonging in a more general cultural, social, political, and ideological sense. The trend that resulted in racially restrictive covenants and the like grew out of redlining and other such practices that originated in urban centers and arguably matured in the suburbs during the 1950s. While this trend persisted in many suburbs and rendered them exclusively white or at the very least relatively racially homogenous, there were a number of suburbs outside of cities like Miami and Phoenix, and even Los Angeles, that were surprisingly racially heterogenous. Likewise, residents mobilized against a host of other spatial and cultural incursions and more mundane nuisances that are not typically associated with the kind of racist and classist techniques of redlining.                                                      58 “Residents Claim Site Hurts Homes,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, July 9, 1959, pg. 1-6. 59 See any number of histories about white flight, for example, Kenneth T. Jackson, Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States, Robert O. Self, American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland, Kevin M. Kruse, White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism, as well as examples of heterogenous suburbs in Wendy Cheng, The Changs Next Door to the Díazes: Remapping Race in Suburban California.  61  Anaheim’s histories of contests over space are surprisingly nuanced, if occasionally trivial. In March of 1956, for example, a group of residents from the Cottonwood Circle tract objected to the proposed construction of a medical center. They feared that the increased traffic from patients would endanger children attending the three previously approved but not yet constructed new schools in the same neighborhood.60 Two other proposed hospitals were temporarily denied their applications for variances in late-1955 for similar complaints of noise and traffic from residents. The Anaheim Planning Commission did grant a third hospital their request for a zone variance, however, despite opposition from parents in the neighborhood who argued that there already was a medical building across the street and that “noises of screaming sirens” scared school children and kept them up at night.61 Similarly, over thirty residents from the Home Fair Civic Association protested the proposed construction of a new church for the Southern California District Church of the Nazarene. In 1953, residents of S. Los Angeles Street protested at the weekly meeting of the Anaheim Planning Commission against the proposed variance and ensuing construction of a union hall for the Teamsters, Truck Drivers, Chauffeurs and Warehousemen’s Union. Residents like Bernard Flynn and David Collins argued that the hall might be used to hire workers, with their main objection being with the potential for “unemployed members hanging about during the day.”62 By the end of 1953, residents were fighting to                                                      60 “City Planning Commission Has Busy Session Mon.,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 8, 1956, pg. 1. 61 “Two Variances Refused; One Granted at Meeting,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, December 22, 1955, pg. 1. 62 “Property Owners Object to Union Hall; Planners Turn Down Variance,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, November 5, 1953. 62  keep dump trucks and other large vehicles from using the network of streets in and around Anaheim’s city center. Citing issues of noise, traffic, and general safety, Anaheim residents wanted to re-route all trucks away from the city center, but they ran up against opposition in the California Dump Truck Owners Association, who argued that the extended travel and delivery times would affect consumers first and foremost.63 Throughout the 1950s, residents formed ad-hoc associations and groups for the expressed purposes of protecting the interests of homeowners and the community. In 1957, residents formed the South Anaheim Homeowners Association in response to a proposed rezoning of land adjacent to their neighborhood for light manufacturing. These groups often hired attorneys and other legal representatives or specialists to advocate for them in city planning commission meetings. The South Anaheim Homeowners Association hired attorney Arthur W. Gray, Jr., to outline their grievances with the proposed rezoning, which included “threatening the residential character of the area, creating a danger to the more than 400 small children already in the area and threatening the property value of the homes involved.”64 Unsurprisingly, by mid-1959, one of the more popular complaints against apartment housing and other multi-family units was framed as an “invasion of privacy.”65 Before, however, community members balked against renters in these multi-family units on the basis that they wanted to encourage permanent residents in the area, and they                                                      63 “Dump Truck Owners Seek Use of City’s Main Street,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, December 12, 1953, pg. 1. 64 Proposed Rezoning of So. Anaheim Is Protested By Area Residents,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, July 4, 1957, pg. 1. 65 “Councilmen Act to Settle Apartment House Dispute,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, June 11, 1959, pg. 1. 63  wanted a stronger tax base, citing smaller tax rates for renters versus homeowners.66 The city planning commission tried to limit Anaheim’s temporary residents in early 1956 by proposing an ordinance that would fine mobile home owners who stayed in Anaheim longer than ninety days up to 500 dollars or sentence them to six months in jail.67 Although temporary residents, businesses, and cultural institutions like the church drew the most flak for noise and traffic, sometimes Anaheim residents spoke out against their own friends and neighbors in an effort to domineer the physical space around them. In November of 1955, for example, the Anaheim Planning Commission denied an extension for a variance in a residential area to Jo Ann Burdick, who initially secured the variance to teach baton twirling at her home. Neighbors objected that “majorettes twirling on the lawn at the school” were devaluing their property, and city planners gave in to their pressure.68 Anaheim residents were able to wield considerable political power during the 1950s, especially when it came to shaping the character of the neighborhoods in their very own backyards. But, throughout the mid and late-1950s, city councilors were equally keen to protect the interests of investors and developers. In 1959, for example, when homeowners pushed back against the construction of a two-story apartment complex bordering their own homes, council members argued that subdividers had just as                                                      66 “City Council in Stormy Session,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 1, 1956, pg. 1. 67 “Planning Commission Approves Reclassifications; New Ordinance Regulating Trailers Discussed,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, February 9, 1956, pg. 1. 68 “Baton-Dance School Refused Variance By Planning Group,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, November 10, 1955, pg. 1. 64  much of a right to insure or expand their investments as individual homeowners did.69 This tension between the desires of homeowners and city officials were indicative of other social, cultural, political, and economic tensions that played out of the physical landscape of suburban neighborhoods. As the nation reckoned with new scales of industry and prosperity, suburban residents capitalized on government subsidized housing and road construction while simultaneously forming a political, social, and cultural movement rooted in a libertarian disdain for government intrusion. Inspired by the optimism of postwar wealth and anxieties of the Cold War Era, suburbanites forged a new American identity rooted in white, middle-class cultural values, all of which found expression in the theme parks of the era like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas, as the conclusion and ensuing two chapters will show.   Arlington, Texas, much like Anaheim, California, was an emblematic Sunbelt suburb of the postwar era prior to the arrival of its signature theme park in 1961. In many ways, the sudden growth and transformation of the region from rural pasturelands to industrial and tourist hub of Southwest mirror the story of Anaheim on the West Coast. The most recognizable similarity between the two, aside from their unique amusement centers, was their sudden population explosions in the mid-1950s. An article from The Daily News-Texan in January of 1961 claimed that the Dallas-Fort Worth area exploded to a combined population of over 1.7 million residents, making the region the nation’s eleventh largest consumer market. It also marveled at the rapid pace at which the region                                                      69 “City Ponders Restriction Of Two-Story Buildings,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, June 4, 1959, pg. 1. Council members ironically argued that the disputed land was zoned for multifamily use and development since 1956, as if rezoning wasn’t a common occurrence. 65  was changing, stating that the Great Southwest Industrial District, “what is today that nation’s largest planned industrial community was a pastureland” only a few years prior.70 Like Anaheim, Arlington promoters seized the opportunity to chart a new course for the former land of wildcats and cattle and came upon an unlikely key to the region’s continued success throughout the twentieth century in the form of the theme park.  The city of Arlington experienced a sizable population increase after the mid-century, growing from 7,692 residents in 1950 to 44,775 residents in 1960, with the population nearly doubling every decade thereafter.71 From 1950 to 1970 the population of Arlington grew by 1,089 percent, compared to a 1,045 percent increase in Anaheim for the same period.72 The size of the city kept apace with this population growth throughout the latter-half of the twentieth century, as well. Under the stewardship of Mayor Tom Vandergriff, the city began annexing and incorporating lands surrounding the city in all directions from the early-1950s onward. Local historian O. K. Carter notes that following World War II, North Texas’s economy was poised to grow exponentially. As such, city planners in Arlington, as well as in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Grand Prairie, began competing for hundreds and thousands of acres at a time to facilitate new industrial and residential growth. In the case of Lake Arlington, for example, Carter notes that the Arlington City Council made the decision to annex the land in a single night following                                                      70 “GSC Industries Replace Pastureland,” The Daily News-Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, January 29, 1961, pg. 11.  71 Statistics compiled from census data by The Texas Almanac and published on their site.  https://texasalmanac.com/sites/default/files/images/CityPopHist%20web.pdf 72 See table 2-2 in Lang and LeFurgy, Boomburbs, pg. 37. 66  rumors that the neighboring Grand Prairie was eyeing the same property.73 Like Anaheim, city promoters in Arlington sensed a change in the winds and competed viciously throughout the 1950s to accrue land and attract new industries to the emerging metropolitan region.  Before the post-war era, Arlington was largely a bedroom community between Dallas and Fort Worth. Residents living in Arlington oftentimes did not work in the town proper, and instead found jobs in one of the nearby cities. During the war, many Arlington residents worked in wartime industries, like at Air Force Plant Four in Fort Worth or at North American Aviation in Grand Prairie. By 1938, Arlington had halted use of the interurban railway, instead relying on busses to ferry workers between cities. This seemingly mundane shift signaled a broader turn away from certain, more accessible forms of public transportation and toward a system that financed the construction of roads and promoted the use of private automobiles. In 1957, the city complete construction on the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike—now Interstate 30—which ran east to west through northern Arlington. That same year, state and county authorities began converting parts of former U.S. Highway 80 which ran through downtown Arlington into Interstate 20.74 These two Interstate construction projects increased the flow of traffic between Dallas and Fort Worth through Arlington, but they simultaneously worked to                                                      73 Nataly Keomoungkhoun and Audrey McClure, “How did Grand Prairie become DFW’s longest north-to-south city?” The Dallas Morning News, October 1, 2020, https://www.dallasnews.com/news/curious-texas/2020/10/01/how-did-grand-prairie-become-d-fws-longest-north-to-south-city-curious-texas-investigates/#. 74 “Interstate Highway Routes Will Carry New Numbers,” Garth Jones, Abilene Reporter-News, Abilene, Texas, September 17, 1957, pg. 1. 67  divert traffic away from the many red lights and traffic signals of the town’s downtown area.75 As to what exactly propelled the small community of Arlington to its boomburb status, many attribute it to the goals and vision of Mayor Vandergriff. The official website of the city of Arlington attributes Vandergriff’s particular suburban sensibilities to his stint at the University of Southern California, and Vandergriff himself cited Anaheim as his primary inspiration in shaping policies in Arlington that privileged light industrial growth and tourism. 76 Six Flags Over Texas, Arlington Stadium, and other tourist attractions were the most visible symbols of Anaheim’s influence on Arlington, but the two shared more than just theme parks and baseball stadiums in the postwar era. As this chapter will illustrate, as Arlington expanded, residents mobilized just as they had in Anaheim to shape the color and character of their own neighborhoods, and of the broader suburbs and cities around.  On the subject of similarities, Arlington would not see a comparable large-scale industrial plant like those in Dallas, Fort Worth, or even the Orange County area until 1954, when General Motors opened a production facility in the city. The GM facility was a huge boon for the city according to most observers, as well as to the continued popularity of Mayor Vandergriff. The plant costed a staggering thirty million dollars to                                                      75 See history of the area on Downtown Arlington website, https://downtownarlington.org/about/history. 76 “Arlington History: 1950-1977—Automobiles & Entertainment Arrive,” City of Arlington Official Website, https://www.arlingtontx.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=14481146&pageId=15059613, “City went California Dreaming in quest for wealth, prestige,” Bob Lloyd, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, May 6, 1984, pg. 1. 68  construct but would go on to employ over 2,000 workers from Arlington and the surrounding areas within the first few years of operation.77 It also became a point of pride for the Arlington community, and more concretely a point of leverage in negotiations over land annexation and overall expansion of businesses in the area. Stories allege that Mayor Vandergriff used the projected water use increase from the plant to muscle out Grand Prairie in debates over the land for Lake Arlington.78   Not long after the opening of the General Motors plant, Arlington experienced an influx of new businesses and industries looking to set up shop in the area. In January of 1955, for example, Mayor Vandergriff, Grand Prairie Mayor John Dougherty, and C. D. Troyer of Sears, Roebuck and Co. officiated the groundbreaking for a new, 85,000 square-foot department store.79 This new consumer center was in part a gamble—one that would certainly pay off—since the region had not yet reached population levels of other larger suburbs, but it signaled an unbridled optimism from both Mayor Vandergriff and those investors willing to cast their lot on the growth potential of the suburb between the cities. This belief in the purchasing power of the great Dallas-Fort Worth region would last well into the 1970s and beyond, as evidenced in 1970 when the Six Flags Mall in Arlington would open despite an ongoing national economic slump.                                                       77 “First Car Turned Out At Arlington GM Plant,” The Dallas Morning News, January 8, 1954. 78 Keomoungkhoun and McClure.  79 WBAP-TV (Television station: Fort Worth, Tex.).

The Great Southwest Industrial District would be first and foremost a site for major business investment and new regional centers of various industries, as the name suggests. But plans for the site included the construction of a handful of restaurants; a sizeable bowling alley; a recreation center; an indoor sports complex; and a private club.81 By January of 1958, only 900 of the original 5,000 acres purchased by the Great Southwest Corporation were developed or under development, but those numbers suggested both amount of growth already underway in post-war Arlington as well as a large degree of optimism in the city’s continued expansion in the ensuing decades.82 The latter number ballooned to 6,600 acres by January of 1968, with the industrial district expanding to include more “manufacturing and research centers, residential apartments, distribution centers and office buildings,” with an estimated 263 total companies occupying the district.83 Among those businesses were General Aerospace Corp., Sunshine Biscuit Co.,                                                      80 “Opening of Six Flags Mall In Arlington,” August, 1970, WFAA Collection in the G.

Worth area was gaining national acclaim as a burgeoning region for economic growth and industrial expansion. William Zeckendorf of New York promised investors that the region represented “the greatest opportunity of any metropolitan area of the nation,” granted, as part of the investment team for the Great Southwest Industrial District, he may have been biased.85 The Great Southwest Industrial District was certainly a major boon to the Arlington economy, but the district itself straddled the border between Arlington and Grand Prairie.86 As such, the cities often shared the wealth, as did other cities in the greater Dallas-Ft. Worth region. The success of the Great Southwest Industrial District, and the wealth and resources it brought to Arlington and the surrounding area, illustrated how intimately tied these economies were to one another. In 1962, estimates held that the Great Southwest Corporation had invested upwards of six million dollars in infrastructural projects to facilitate travel to and from the industrial park. These funds helped to establish numerous railroads, streets, and bridges into and around the 5,800 acres of previous “farm and ranch land,” as well as to improve previous infrastructure.87                                                      84 “GSW has year of growth,” Grand Prairie Daily News, Grand Prairie, Texas, February 23, 1969, pg. 6. 85 “Realtor Stresses Area Opportunity,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort-Worth, Texas, March 21, 1958, pg. 42. 86 Arlington and Grand Prairie in particular often cooperated to solve public works related questions like electricity and sewage disposal for the industrial district. See for example “City Cooperation Brings Solutions,” The Daily News-Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, January 24, 1960, pg. 8. 87 “Great Southwest Surges With Six New Buildings,” The Daily News-Texas, Grand Prairie, Texas, May 13, 1962, pg. 1. 71  As discussed earlier, these cities often competed for land and annexed or incorporated territory in a zero-sum game, but their individual economic successes were due to the appeal of the broader region for investors and industrialists.  In fact, most advertisements for the Great Southwest Corporation and other such industrial districts highlighted the fact that the Arlington area was intimately tied to the economies of not only the Dallas-Fort Worth region, but the greater US Southwest. One GSC advertisement from 1957 stated as much when it claimed that the Dallas-Fort Worth region “dominates five states of the Southwest and directly serves 12 states and Mexico.”88 Another advertisement from 1962 stated that the Great Southwest Industrial Center was “Right in the big middle of the big market.”89 By the early-1970s, although Arlington was establishing itself as a proper city in the metropole, news outlets outside the region still lumped it in with the other smaller municipalities in the area. Albert Hughes of the Christian Science Monitor called the space between Dallas and Fort Worth the “40-mile suburbia,” although he did marvel at its “amazing collection of shopping center, business and industrial complexes, condominium and apartment house blocks, and residences.”90 Mayor Vandergriff admitted that the city did not “‘begrudge being the dash in Dallas-dash-Fort Worth.’”91 The completion of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in 1970 on Arlington’s border solidified its status as the center of what came to be called the                                                      88 See Great Southwest Corporation advertisement in Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, January 20, 1957, pg. 9. 89 See Great Southwest Corporation advertisement in The Irving Daily News Texan, Irving, Texas, March 25, 1962, pg. 11. 90 “Texas’ ‘Vibrant Gateway,’” The Washington Post, Times Herald, Washington, D.C., January 30, 1972, pg.

One of the more visible markers of the coming cultural changes was in the name of the corporation itself. Advertisements for the coming industrial center and for the larger corporation point to a phenomenon that Michael Phillips discusses in their book White Metropolis.93 During the post-war era, and in the 1950s in particular, promoters in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and other cities across Texas discursively reoriented their cities away from the South and toward the burgeoning Southwest.  But this reorientation coexisted with an equally present veneration of the Confederate South. The mascot for Arlington State College, for example, was the rebel. During the Arlington State College homecoming parade in 1951, the homecoming court rode in the “Dixie Lee”, which was the “official ship of the Rebel squad.”94 As was the case in Anaheim, Arlington swiftly became a hotbed of cultural opposites.

Scholars and popular commentators alike mused that the suburbs of the 1950s and 1960s in particular were sites of contested histories precisely because these were relatively new landscapes without explicit connections to urban centers and the histories represented in them.95  These hopes and anxieties over the shifting parameters of Texas’ very identity would find their outlet at Six Flags Over Texas, as chapter three will illustrate. But before diving deeper into how the park’s themes and marketing navigated these countervailing regional cultural movements, it’s important to explore Arlington’s postwar culture in further detail.     As mentioned earlier, national electoral politics are perhaps the most visible and readily accessible lenses through which we can view local sentiments and concerns. Like Representative James B. Utt of Anaheim’s congressional district, Congressman Olin E. “Tiger” Teague’s tenure as Representative for Texas’s sixth congressional district was long and celebrated. Unlike Utt, though, Teague managed to keep a low profile and avoid controversy during his successive terms from 1946 to 1978. As Chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee from 1955 to 1973, Teague received some pushback for his role in stopping a World War I veterans’ pension plan with one veteran going so far as to dub Teague “that arch enemy of all World War veterans.”96 Critics maintained that                                                      95 Paul J. P. Sandul challenges this oversimplified explanation for history—or lack thereof—in suburbs in “Suburban Memory Works: Historical Representation and Meaning in Orangevale, California,” Making Suburbia, pg. 91-93. 96 “Letters From The People: Exaggeration,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, September 24, 1963, pg. 6. 74  Teague’s estimates for taxpayer costs for the proposed pension were overinflated and, regardless, that claimants to the pension plan would all be dead and gone by 1975.97 Overall, though, Teague managed to retain his popularity among his constituents throughout his consecutive terms through his role as Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chair and his ability to appease both agriculturalists and city boosters in his district as a classic conservative Democrat of the era.98  Although Teague’s tenure as representative was without comparable controversy, Arlington and the broader Dallas-Fort Worth region remained relatively conservative throughout the latter-half of the twentieth century. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Tarrant County conservatives maintained control over both state parties, insuring their influence on state politics for these two decades.99 In 1984, Dallas played host to the Republican National Convention, and Arlington was the de facto resting spot for many out-of-towners for the convention.100 Voters in Tarrant County voted for the Republican                                                      97 “The People Speak: Would Spend Our Aid Money At Home,” The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, July 29, 1956, pg. 2. 98 “Let’s Look At The Record,” The Mexia Daily News, Mexia, Texas, May 5, 1960, pg. 4, “Teague, Olin Earl [Tiger] (1910 – 1981)”, Handbook of Texas, Texas State Historical Association, https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/teague-olin-earl-tiger.   99 “Tarrant Conservatives Keep Democratic Grip,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, May 6, 1962, pg. 1, “Johnson Seems Certain of Tarrant Support,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, May 8, 1960, pg. 20, “Conservatives in Tarrant Strengthen Hold,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, July 27, 1958, pg. 2, “Tarrant Conservatives Surging Back Into Power Lost In May,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, July 29, 1956, pg. 9.  100 The convention proved contentious mainly due to economic concerns, as Convention planners canceled reservations at the last minute at many area hotels for an undisclosed reason.

Just as post-war Arlington balanced industrial expansionist impulses with the desire to retain a cozy, small-town vibe, so too did cultural mores and social norms waffle between tradition and change throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Like Anaheim, area newspapers like The Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram featured an abundance of printed announcements celebrating anniversaries, weddings, and engagements of local couples, and as with Anaheim, these and other such local announcements served to reinforce the smalltown vibe of the suburbs in a time of great change. These newspapers also celebrated births and mourned the passing of its citizens, underscoring how major life events of regular Arlington residents were newsworthy occasions. But, as discussed earlier in the chapter, Arlington was simultaneously experiencing an unprecedented population explosion. It quickly became harder to maintain old social practices and lifeways, like keeping tabs on the nuptials and births of the town’s populace. And, as was the case in Anaheim, these rapid changes inspired simultaneous efforts to maintain cultural practices of smalltown Arlington and to make way for the surge of new residents and the diversity they brought with them.                                                      101 Many stalwarts of the New Right remained apologists for Goldwater despite his lack of mainstream appeal. See Self, All in the Family, pg. 292. 76   As Americans moved away from the austerity of the 1930s to the abundance of the 1950s, photographers cataloguing these economic and social changes in rural areas for the Farm Security Administration began focusing on find “Miss America”. She represented a new era of American women, and era of wives and mothers who relished in their femininity.102 As early as 1938, the photography of John Vachon depicted these women in the home, surrounded by name-brand products and meticulously manicured domestic scenes.103 These photographs contrasted the iconic photography of the earlier decade, like Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” image, turning away from the destitution and privation of the Depression era and toward the promise of prosperity. It is no surprise, then, that in the suburbs of America, women’s beauty pageants became a new arena wherein these postwar ideals of femininity as illustrated in the Miss America pageants and photographs found expression.  Like other suburbs, especially those in the South, pageantry was a large part of Arlington’s post-war culture. Throughout the early-1970s, pageant contestants and winners would make their way to Six Flags Over Texas for various publicity events. An excerpt from a November 1961 edition of the Six Flags Gazette shows a recent visit from Miss Texas, Linda Lofts, and Miss Arlington, Judy Taylor, along with a host of other “beauties.”104 The park’s 1971 opening ceremony featured appearances by Miss Georgia, Miss Missouri, and Miss Texas, representing the three states with Six Flags parks as of                                                      102 Ryan Lee Cartwright discusses the photography of the FSA in the 1930s in “Curious Scenes: The Fringes of Rural Rehabilitation in 1930s Documentary Photography,” Peculiar Places, pg. 54-61. 103 Cartwright, pg. 61. 104 “A Place For Beauty,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, November 1961, pg. 7. 77  that year.105 In 1978, representatives for the Miss Texas pageant paid a visit to Six Flags Over Texas. Channel 5 News reported on the event, remaking that the contestants “apparently are not allowed to sweat,” and despite having a day in the park, they were on display until the end of the pageant, and were to dress and act accordingly. At one point, the narrator jokes, “You might get the idea they spend all their hours posing for pictures,” but that was not the case, as, “They spend a lot of time waiting to pose for pictures” as well.106 Pageantry and industry often went hand in hand, with many area businesses sponsoring or hosting beauty pageants themselves. In March of 1953, for example, the Texas Engineering and Manufacturing Company held the Miss Temco pageant, with the winner moving on to represent the greater Dallas-Ft. Worth region in the National Press Photographers pageant.107 Worth noting here is that the three judges of the pageant were all local men from military backgrounds. Anaheim hosted a similar “Industrial Queen” pageant in the Spring of 1955 as part of a planned “Industrial Progress Week” to celebrate the upward trajectory of Anaheim’s economy. The pageant was also a broader celebration of American free enterprise according to event organizers, and an opportunity                                                      105 McCown, pg. 131. 106 KXAS-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

Like the Miss America of Vachon’s photograph—who was a working nurse and not a housewife, as the image might suggest—these ideals rarely reflected the actual day to day lives of Arlington’s women, but they nonetheless remained influential.110    Two major leisure and amusement facilities pre-dated Six Flags Over Texas by a couple of decades, but nonetheless are illustrative of a similar interconnectedness of leisure spaces and the cultural climate of the surrounding region of Arlington. The first was Arlington Downs, a racetrack opened in 1929 that hosted horseraces, rodeos, and other vehicle races and events until the 1950s. Although the location had been in decline since the mid-1930s following the death of owner William T. Waggoner and the ensuing outlawing of parimutuel wagering, it remained an institution throughout the 1940s and 1950s.111 Angus G. Wynne, Jr. and the Great Southwest Corporation purchased the land in 1957 with plans to expand the industrial district, but sold the parcel to another                                                      108 “Anaheim to Pay Homage to Industry; ‘Industrial Queen’ to be Selected,” Anaheim Gazette, Anaheim, California, March 24, 1955, pg. 1. 109 WBAP-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

Gambling activity persisted off and on at the location up until 1956, when the proprietors of the Bible Baptist Seminary purchased the property to construct a new school. Somewhat ironically, the members of the seminary bought the land in order to relocate, since their previous location was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a parking lot.114  These two instances epitomize the intersection of Arlington’s economy and culture at the mid-century moment. Downtown development pushed out one of Arlington’s many religious institutions, but as demonstrated above, the Bible Baptist Seminary found a new home on the periphery of the rapidly expanding city on top of the old home of gambling and extralegal leisure in the Top O’ Hill Terrace. Similarly, the land of another former hub for gambling and spectatorship, Arlington Downs, changed hands between industrial boosters until the 1980s. The former illustrated that even as Arlington expanded and displaced some local institutions, others, like the fundamentalists of the Bible Baptist Seminary, successfully navigated the shifting landscape before them                                                      112 NBC 5/KXAS News script (AR0787), University of North Texas Special Collections, https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1325983/?q=%22Arlington%20Downs%22.   113 KXAS-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

The story of the latter showed, however, that leisure spaces needed rebranding in the postwar moment to stave off the spread of industrial parks and office buildings. Although the planned mixed-use commercial and residential expansion to the industrial district did not come to fruition—at least not under the Great Southwest Corporation—it signaled that Arlington’s governing institutions had a clear vision for post-war growth. Like many cities of a similar size and population growth trajectory, Arlington sought to model itself as the ideal post-war sprawling city-suburb hybrid. Roads were widened, parking lots were paved, and former corridors dotted by red-lights and stop signs were converted to highways and interstates to facilitate personal car usage in and between the city and its neighbors. Industrial parks and one-stop-shop consumer hubs at the edges of town replaced the marginally-more-diverse downtown area. The construction of single-family homes accelerated to keep up with the cities growing population.    Boosters and industrialists were quick to assure residents that the many planned industrial sites and additions to their region would be a net-positive, but they still had to answer to the suburban concerns of Arlington citizens. One article from 1967 claimed that “Nowhere to be seen in the industrial district are ugly factories belching smoke.” The article lauded the overall design of the industrial complex with its modern, clean lines. It likewise guaranteed that all parking was off-street, and that “extensive landscaping programs have beautified the entire district.”115 Industrialists, promoters, and officials alike recognized that Arlington was quickly becoming eerily similar to the urban centers                                                      115 “Fun and Industry Flourish Side-By-Side,” Six Flags Gazette, Summer, 1967, pg. 23. 81  its residents were often fleeing in terms of size and, in some instances, architecture. As such, they were quick to employ their own forms of anti-urban rhetoric to ease residents’ fears that their serene suburban haven was still a shelter from the unsavory aspects of urbanity.  As Arlington and Anaheim rose to prominence as entertainment centers of their respective regions, outside commentators were quick to draw comparisons between the two metropolitan areas. In 1983, for example, Channel 5 Action News in Arlington ran a feature on tourism and leisure in the Dallas-Fort Worth region in response to the opening of Wet ‘N Wild down the road from Six Flags Over Texas. When asked if the park could survive the new competition in town, one spokesperson argued that the Los Angeles metropolitan region had Knott’s Berry Farm, Disneyland, and Magic Mountain, and they were all successful. In fact, spokespeople from both parks argued that their combined power would “add to the image of Arlington and the Metroplex as a family tourist destination.”116 But, as this section illustrated, these two boomburbs shared more than just a cluster of themed amusement spaces. Much like their host suburbs, Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were symbols of a changing cultural, social, and economic landscape. And much like the process of suburbanization, the planning and construction of these forthcoming cultural institutions was indicative of the confidence that these changes were for the better.

That transformation would necessitate a staggering amount of money and manpower, and the willingness of everyone involved to undertake these endeavors points to the overall optimism in America’s continued postwar prosperity. All told, the total investment cost for Six Flags Over Texas was just over 10,000,000 dollars, and for Disneyland, the initial budget of 10,000,000 ballooned to 17,000,000 dollars by opening day. As Wynne, Jr., joked, “This was a pretty large sum of money to be speculating with.”117  To get parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas “off the drawing board and into the steel, lumber, and plastics of reality” was a gargantuan task.118 As commentators noted about Disneyland, “a little over ten years ago, this whole area was just an orange grove, and some farmhouses.” There is a widely circulated video clip that regularly accompanied these stories of Disneyland’s planning where Disney himself paces across the orange groves, counting with each step as if to take a measurement.119 Journalists used a similar narrative when discussing the construction of Six Flags Over Texas, repeating how the park was located on former pastureland or “what once was scrubby grassland.”120 For both parks, narratives surrounding their construction were overwhelmingly positive. The fact that both men moved metaphorical mountains—and                                                      117 “Six Flags President Says Big Crowds May Fill Park,” Marshall Lynam, Fort Worth Star Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, July 12, 1961, pg. 10. 118 “By The Way with Bill Henry,” Bill Henry, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1955, pg. 1. 119 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 120 “Six Flags Over Texas Combines History and Fun,” Edward J.

F8. 83  occasionally mountain-sized mounds of dirt and earth—to bring these immersive environments to life was a feat to be celebrated by the broader public. There was an irony to the work in that park builders leveled, maimed, gutted, and despoiled acres upon acres of land to create another kind of replica of the natural world, but those criticisms were relatively few and far between during the early decades. In an interview for the Anderson Herald, Walt Disney mentioned that the site selection for Disneyland was a process. He comments that he had begun envisioning various locations for the park as early as 1938, and had “everything figured out except where to park the cars.”121 A second article from The Los Angeles Times states that Disney had originally planned for the park to sit on the same plot of land as the original animation studio in Burbank, California, but the rapid sprawl resulting from the success of the studio made that location untenable for a major tourist attraction.122 The park necessitated that the vast majority of the trees and houses be moved or demolished altogether to make way for the artificial hills and riverbeds. But the park also encountered numerous issues and setbacks in its efforts to reshape the land to its liking. When the park pumped water into its “Rivers of America” feature in Frontierland, the sandy soil sucked it all away beneath the surface. In response, the park hauled tons of clay soil to coat the lake’s bottom and prevent further leakage.123 Over two million gallons of water was                                                      121 “Disney Builds Park Fairyland for Children,” Anderson Herald, Anderson, Indiana, May 8, 1955, pg. 30. 122 “By The Way with Bill Henry,” The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, February 1, 1955, pg. 1. 123 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8.  84  pumped into the artificial rivers of Adventureland, alone.124 In 1959, Disney dredged a staggering tonnage of dirt to make way for the park’s lagoon. 1959 additions included the Matterhorn attraction and the monorail, the first of its kind in America.  The building team behind Six Flags Over Texas similarly moved mountains to construct the Texas-sized theme park in 1961. Estimates hold that “250,000 yards of dirt were moved; 12,000 square feet of plaster was applied; two million square feet of paving was laid; and 100,000 feet of conduit and wiring were laid.” Construction teams also dug out man-made lakes and rivers to accent the landscape, and these features held a collective three million gallons of water, “with another 50 million just outside the park” in a large reservoir.125 Unlike the Disneyland construction process, though, the team behind Six Flags Over Texas utilized “existing vegetation and more than 1,000 trees on site…so that the beauty of the site would be preserved in as much of its natural state as possible.”126 One Frontierland Mine Train operator summer it up best in 1958 when he quipped that although the ride’s “natural bridge was created by centuries of rain, wind, and sandstorms,” it was all thanks to “Mr. Disney” who “helped nature along a little.”127 His joke underscores how constructing these two massive amusement centers required an unprecedented amount of capital investment and land redevelopment. The unnamed Mine                                                      124 “A Trip Through Adventureland, Hosted by Walt Disney, 1956, Wonderful World of Disney, Disneyland,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMKcxUyKx0o.   125 Davis McCown, Six Flags Over Texas: The First Fifty Years, 2016, pg. 16. 126 “Planning, Study Built Six Flags,” Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News Texan, Spring 1964, pg. 3. 127 “An Adventure in the Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney, 1958, Disneyland, Walt Disney World, Full Tour,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFW_vHTeVtE. 85  Train also spoke to an increasingly prevalent aspect of narratives the two theme parks and their dynamic creators. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Walt Disney and Angus Wynne, Jr., served as the main representatives for their respective parks in the press and media, and as a consequence, theme parks were indelibly linked to the men that created them in the eyes of American tourists and consumers. Characteristics that defined Disney and Wynne, Jr., were transferred to the parks themselves, elevating both the parks and their creators to near-mythical status in the American zeitgeist. Hedda Hopper’s article covering Disneyland a year before its opening suggested that “With such a man at the helm I have every reason to believe that within a year we will have in Disneyland the greatest entertainment project ever conceived by man.”128 An article in the 1961 issue of The Alcalde features a description of Angus Wynne, Jr. picking up litter during his daily surveys of the park’s landscape. Author Jack Maguire highlights one encounter where after picking up several cigarette butts, a passing guest told Wynne, Jr. that, “‘Surely a healthy-looking man like you could get a better job than this,’” to which Wynne, Jr. assured them that he could but, “I like it here.”129  The various kinds of literature produced about Walt Disney and Angus Wynne, Jr., created a genuine mythology of the two park pioneers. Most media coverage ranged in tone from simple puff pieces to outright odes of admiration for the two men, though they were not without their critics. One writer for the New York Times described Disney                                                      128 “Disneyland Marvels to Be Seen Next July,” Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, August 24, 1954, pg. B6. 129 “The Wynne Who Waves Six Flags,” Jack Maguire, The Alcalde, November 1961, pg. 10. 86  as “A politically conservative man with a profound commitment to free enterprise.”130 Disney was “not anchored by nostalgia to a rural childhood,” and consequently, “While he might regret the vast defoliated suburbia that extends 27 miles to Los Angeles and far beyond,” his shrewd real estate practices had helped him amass a huge profit. The author concludes that Disney’s “Disneyland is a monument to himself that has handsomely paid off.”131 This article reorients the discussion away from Disney as a kind of selfless protector of whimsy and wonder and toward one that exposes him as the calculating capitalist that he was. Litwaklos’s article was an outlier, though. By and large, media marveled at these two theme park progenitors in these early decades, which served to reinforce both how financially successful the parks were and how willing writers, journalists, and investors alike were to roll the dice on these gargantuan endeavors to the reading public.132  Regardless of their tone, articles discussing the two titans of the mid-century amusement industry recognized that they had helped to chart a new course for American recreation, leisure, and consumerism. As innovate as they were, though, both theme parks owed a great deal to the amusement and leisure spaces and the entertainment and technological spectacles that came before them. Aside from urban amusement parks, Disneyland in particular drew inspiration from the format of the various World’s Fairs of the late-1800s and early-1900s. Louis Berg of the Los Angeles Times relayed as much                                                      130 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” Leo E. Litwaklos, New York Times, New York, New York, June 27, 1965, pg. SM24 131 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM25. 132 Neither park was immediately a net-positive financially, of course. Also, the celebratory tone of these articles may hide deep anxieties about the success of these endeavors, but their bets paid off. 87  when he claimed that Disney had “gone hog-wild on a ‘world’s fair’ that’s designed strictly for kids (and himself).”133 As was common in the World’s Fair circuit, Disneyland featured sponsored attractions throughout the park. The Tomorrowland expansions for the 1967 included a host of new attractions sponsored by corporations. Douglas Aircraft sponsored “Flight to the Moon;” Monsanto sponsored “Adventure Thru Inner Space;” General Electric sponsored the “Carousel of Progress;” Bell System sponsored “American the Beautiful;” Coca-Cola sponsored the performance stage and food court; and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber company sponsored the “PeopleMover.”134  Six Flags Over Texas had similar attractions that functioned as part technological spectacles and part advertisements for local businesses and large national corporations. During its early years, the park had a dedicated exhibit hall with rotating attractions from various businesses. For the opening season, Westinghouse sponsored the “Kitchens of Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow” exhibit, which, as the name implies, featured dioramas and recreations dedicated to the past, present, and possible future of kitchen appliances and technologies. The Texas Electric Service Company hosted a similar exhibit with titled “The Story of Power—Power For Progress.”135 Until its closing in 1972, the exhibit hall would feature material from Jones-Blair paints, Braniff Airways, and American Airlines. The park also opened with Humble’s Happy Motoring Freeway, sponsored by                                                      133 “Walt Disney’s New Ten Million Dollar Toy,” Louis Berg, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, September 19, 1954, pg. K8. 134 “Tomorrowland Readied for Disneyland Visitors,” Chicago Tribune, Chicago, Illinois, April 23, 1967, pg. F5. 135 See advertisement for exhibits in Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 1961, pg. 2. 88  Humble Oil, where guests would “roll over a highway of the future” in model cars.136 The Southwester Life Insurance Company sponsored the Animal Kingdom attraction, which was a large animal enclosure wherein guests could interact with kangaroos, goats, elephants, and other animals.   Both brands naturally had corporate partnerships that manifested outside the park, as well. In 1966, the Fant Milling Company published a book of recipes inspired by the rides and attractions at Six Flags Over Texas. Readers could make “Skull Island Treasure Cookies,” or “Cha-Cha Choo Choo Empanadas,”137 Disneyland and the broader Disney brand had no shortage of such sponsored collaborations, whether it was Mickey Mouse partnering with Chevy Chase Dairy to get kids to drink more milk in 1933 or partnering with Blue Bell to advertise Davy Crockett-inspired jeans and jackets for young boys in the 1950s. These advertisements seem odd and out of place inasmuch as both parks aimed to foster a unique and authentic sense of theming separate from the present world. But these corporate alliances made sense from a marketing perspective, as both parks wanted to establish themselves as reliable, family-oriented brands in the broader American consumer culture.138    The inclusion of corporate sponsorships and company logos on the rides and attractions of Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas demonstrates how both were somewhat reliant on money, and consequently on branding from the outside world.                                                      136 “The Wynne Who Waves Six Flags,” Jack Maguire, The Alcalde, November 1961, pg. 8-10. 137 Six Flags Over Texas Cookbook, Fant Milling Company, 1966. 138 See Nicholas Sammond’s Babes in Tomorrowland, pg. 323-56 for a history of official clothing partnerships. 89  Despite their efforts to create wholly unique landscapes evocative of America’s past and future, the parks both included partnerships with the industries of the present. The need to allow the outside world into their gates coexisted throughout both parks’ early histories alongside an unshakeable impulse to give guests an escape from that very outside world. It also coexisted with their respective efforts to police the space bordering the parks.    In January of 1964, for example, Disneyland’s management team mobilized to block the construction of the twenty-two-story Sheraton-Anaheim hotel. Spokespeople for the park argued that the hotel would obstruct the otherwise pristine skyline view from inside the park, thereby breaking guests’ immersion in the themed landscape. In their arguments, Disneyland made it clear that the damage done to the park would have reverberations in the broader Anaheim community. Disneyland vice president, Don Tatum, stated that “If Disneyland is to be surrounded by gleaming glass skyscrapers we will have to re-evaluate whether Disneyland can afford a year-around operation,” and that “If the hotel is approved as proposed, we would have to reevaluate the degree of expansion and future investment.”139 Under pressure, Anaheim Mayor Rex Coons admitted that the then-forty-six million dollar investment, “merits a certain amount of protection.”140 By threatening to shut down if their demands were not met, Disneyland officials leveraged their power as a major employer and money-maker in the area to compel the Sheraton-Anaheim builders to lower the building’s height. In the end,                                                      139 “High Rise Called Threat to Disneyland Expansion Plan,” Jack Boettner, The Lose Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, January 16, 1964, pg. 1. 140 “High Rise Called Threat to Disneyland Expansion Plan.” 90  Disneyland officials’ gambit won out, and the hotel was lowered to an acceptable fourteen stories.  Throughout the 1960s, Disneyland representatives continued to flex their economic and political muscle and to use their clout as a cultural institution to influence a handful of other policies in the Anaheim region. For example, Disney officials helped block a proposed entertainment tax on the grounds that it was “a one-industry tax on Disneyland.” When the Melodyland Theater—an arts and entertainment venue across the street from Disneyland—pitched the idea of bringing a topless revue act from Las Vegas to their stage, Disneyland officials once again protested, arguing that the show “would spoil the family entertainment image created by the park.” The show allegedly ran for one night before being canceled.141    Disneyland’s last-minute rally against the construction of the Sheraton-Anaheim also signaled the company’s ongoing efforts to dissuade other outside commercial interests from the area. Harrison “Buzz” Price and the Economics Research Associates were tasked with outlining solutions to the growing land use problem in September of 1960 and establishing a more permanent work plan for the company going forward. The resulting report stated that, “The need for such a program has been accentuated by the rapid rate of uncoordinated commercial development in the area, the rapid encirclement of Disneyland, and the rise in market value of the properties held by Disneyland.”142                                                        141 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C9. 142 “A Study of Land Use Alternatives for Disneyland Periphery Property,” Economics Research Associates, the Harrison “Buzz” Price Papers Digital Collections at the University of Central Florida, September 16, 1960, pg. 1. 91   The Economic Research Associates’s alternative land use report from 1960, as well as its 1964 economic impact report, also indicate the ways in which the construction and operation of Disneyland shaped Anaheim and the broader Southern California region during its first ten years of operation. As the alternative land use report states, “The development of land in the Disneyland area has been, and continues to be, one of the most dramatic undertakings in real estate history.”143 Likewise, the report claims that the opening of Disneyland provided the “greatest single stimulus” to the growth of the region.144 Its authors rightly point out that Anaheim, like many similar regions throughout the 1950s, was experiencing growth in most calculable categories, and although it was hard to quantify precisely Disneyland’s impact, it was hard to ignore how ingrained the park had become within the broader Southern California region. It’s worth mentioning here that the tone of both the 1960 and 1964 land use and economic impact reports is decidedly pro-Disneyland. Both reports outline the economic impact of the park and its surrounding properties for the explicit purposes of convincing Anaheim city planners to fast-track development within or on behalf of the Disneyland resort.  According to the report, between its opening in 1955 and 1964, Disneyland paid 19.2 million dollars in property taxes and contributed 13.7 million dollars in sales tax.145 City Manager Keith Murdoch stated in 1975 that, “South-central Anaheim would very likely be covered with housing units” had it not been for the arrival of Disneyland in 1955. He added that without Disneyland, “There would be no Anaheim Convention                                                      143 “A Study of Land Use Alternatives for Disneyland Periphery Property,” pg. 9. 144 “A Study of Land Use Alternatives for Disneyland Periphery Property,” pg. 7. 145 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” Jack Boettner, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, July 6, 1975, pg. OC_C1. 92  Center” and that, “The city most likely would not have the California Angles.” Taken together, Larry Sierk, then-executive president of the Anaheim Chamber of Commerce, argued that Disneyland “was the ‘catalyst for this city’s development.”146 Similarly, Mayor William J. Thom concluded that the city would have inevitably grown, “but by no stretch of the imagination would it have been anything like what we have seen with Disneyland. The park is an institution, a milestone in Americana.”147  These comments, alongside the two reports from the Economic Research Associates, spoke to the only-occasionally-measurable impact Disneyland had on the growth and prosperity of Anaheim and the broader Orange County. “But,” as the Los Angeles Times article reflecting on its first twenty years reminds us, “the Disneyland impact has been much more than financial.” Author Jack Boettner adds that Disneyland “has touched the realms of education, culture, civic improvement and religion” in Anaheim and the broader Orange County region, as well.148 As of 1975, the park had donated at least 461,500 dollars to 390 different community organizations to complement its annual community service awards banquet and program. The park also was a major employer in the area, especially among older teens and young adults. It loaned its costumed characters for local school and community events, and as Anaheim City School District Superintendent James D. Brier pointed out, “The park placed us in a very favorable position and helped us conduct an effective recruitment program.” Disneyland                                                      146 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8. 147 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8. 148 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8. 93  had an undeniable allure that Brier acknowledges might have attracted strong candidates to the area that would have otherwise looked elsewhere.149 CONCLUSION  Theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland are often lauded for their ability to transport visitors to another time and another place. They are centers of technological innovation and unrivaled thematic immersion for many. Yet, as this chapter illustrates, theme parks are also deeply tied to their specific time periods and geographic locations. During the mid-1950s and through the 1960s, both amusement centers and their host cities underwent significant changes, and each became pseudo monuments to a particular postwar American culture: one that longed for an idealized and imagined past and for a near future of technological innovations and continued economic prosperity. Moreover, the discursive coupling of both theme parks and broader notions of what we now retroactively associate with suburbia began relatively early on in their histories. One article published in the Anderson Herald in May of 1955 described Disneyland as, “a wonderland of delights such as the world may never have seen before,” that rose “out of the orange groves in this sunny suburb of Los Angeles.”150 Both theme parks and suburbs were relatively new landscapes that summarily became spatial embodiments of postwar America. From Disneyland’s inception, journalists wrote that Disney’s “central aim” was “to take people from this tense, nerve-killing world of today into a dream one of                                                      149 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8. 150 “Disney Builds Park Fairyland for Children,” Anderson Herald, Anderson, Indiana, May 8, 1955, pg. 30. 94  yesterday and tomorrow.” The park was meant to help people escape “the cynicism” and “boredom of the modern-day world.” But, as discussed earlier in this chapter, both Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas initially relied on corporate sponsorship to fund a large share of their attractions. Tomorrowland, for example, was heralded as a space “where industry will exhibit its latest creations,” and Six Flags Over Texas likewise loaned out space in its parks to local and national businesses to promote their latest products.151 As such, the parks were always simultaneously an escapist landscape hinging on a veritable disdain of contemporary society and a business enterprise indebted to corporations. Despite claims that “The present has no place in Disneyland,” it and Six Flags Over Texas remained intimately tied to the contemporary world around it.152  Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas captured the forward momentum of the US economy in the post-war moment with their sprawling landscapes dedicated to promising visions of future possibilities. Likewise, both theme parks contained within their themes and marketing deep anxieties over the changing world around them. They offered guests a glimpse into the future alongside a retreat to the past. More than just an escape from the outside world, it was clear that even as early as their inaugural years, theme parks were reflections of a whole host of post-war social, cultural, and economic trends. And just as their host towns, Anaheim and Arlington, creators and promoters of Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas understood that invoking or otherwise appealing to the child and the                                                      151 “Disneyland Marvels to Be Seen Next July,” Hedda Hopper, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, August 24, 1954, pg. B6. 152 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” Leo E. Litwaklos, New York Times, New York, New York, June 27, 1965, pg. SM23. 95  family in this postwar moment was a surefire way to embed the parks in the larger zeitgeist as bastions against the rising tide of cultural, social, and economic change. 96  Chapter 2: Meet Me Down on Main Street: Disneyland and the Postwar Child  In September of 1987, American family sitcom Full House premiered on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network. The show centered on the lives of Danny Tanner, his three young daughters, Michelle, Stephanie, and DJ, and his two co-parenting counterparts, Jesse Katsopolis and Joey Gladstone. The show enjoyed an eight-season run during the late-1980s and early-1990s and quickly became one of the most watched primetime family entertainment television shows. In May of 1993, it aired a two-part special called “The House Meets the Mouse.” The episodes see the Tanner family vacationing at Orlando’s Disney World theme park after Uncle Jesse gets a music gig at the Magic Kingdom. Eight minutes into episode one, after a quick visit from Disney mainstays Donald Duck and Goofy, the family pours over the day’s itinerary in the park. Uncle Jesse, who is swamped with rehearsals, promises to meet up with the family sometime later in Fantasyland and quips about exploring other kinds of fantasies with wife Becky back at the honeymoon suite, and the laugh track queues. Jesse exits the scene, and the conversation returns to the day’s agenda after a beat. Family patriarch Danny just then remembers—perhaps thanks to Uncle Jesse’s remark about sexual fantasies—that his girlfriend Vicky is joining the group at Disney World, which prompts middle sister Stephanie to ask if he intends to propose at the park. This comment foreshadows one of the central comedic tensions of the episode, where Danny’s plans to propose are continuously foiled by shenanigans in the park.  By the end of the following scene, the episode has established the remaining conflicts that will feature throughout the two-part season finale. Youngest sister Michelle 97  gets crowned princess for the day after cutting in front of Stephanie, and oldest sister DJ sees the face of her boyfriend Steve in the character actor for Aladdin. The two youngest sisters continue to squabble throughout the episode, and eventually Princess Michelle splits off from the group to forge her own journey through the park while DJ shouts “Steve!” at every male character actor in Magic Kingdom. At the end of the episode, the family watches on as Uncle Jesse and his band play their show. Steve has flown from San Francisco to Orlando in order to join DJ for one last night at the park. Michelle has reunited with the family after Snow White and friends teach her a valuable lesson about being selfless. Uncle Jesse dedicates his performance of “A Dream is a Wish your Heart Makes” to his wife, Becky. Fireworks burst over the concert and a cluster of them spell out Danny’s marriage proposal to Vicky in the sky. Even perennial tag-alongs Joey and Kimmy join in on the family-friendly romantic gestures, with Joey dancing with Snow White and Kimmy linking arms with Prince Charming, only to be politely separated by a smiling Cinderella.   Full House’s two-part finale in the park includes many of the expected themes and tropes of the American family sitcom of the latter-half of the twentieth century. Central among those themes is, obviously, the family as the nucleus around which the story is constructed. Both episodes derive their dramatic tension and comedic moments from the interpersonal relationships among the Tanner family first and foremost. The sisters fight while the father endeavors to propose to Vicky to fill the void of the mother while the Katsopolis’s, Jesse and Becky, contend with balancing work and family. Each dramatic and comedic beat within the narrative hinges on the two family units and their interactions between and among one another.  98  Heterosexual romance and courtship also feature heavily within family sitcoms like the two-part season finale of Full House. In these episodes, for example, Jesse, DJ, and Danny are each involved in hetero-romantic sub-plots that exist in tandem with the main nuclear family narrative. One outlier among the family-friendly love stories is Jesse’s explicit—albeit brief—reference to sexual intercourse and sexual fantasy with Becky. Although Jesse makes the comment in front of a handful of toddlers, tweens, and teens, no one bats and eye. Within the landscape of the family sitcom, explicit sexual references are permissible, even sanctioned to a degree, as long as they are contained within the heterosexual family—in this case between the wedded Jesse and Becky.  Joey and Kimmy, likewise, seem to serve as characters that shore up rather than disrupt the gendered, sexual, and familial boundaries of the heteronuclear family throughout the episode. Toward the beginning of part one, Joey joins Goofy and Donald in expressing some enthusiasm at the idea of having a tea party with Michelle and the other Disney princesses. Jesse reacts to Joey’s excitement with a disapproving shake of his head, and Joey corrects course and suggests that they play hockey instead. The combination of the audience’s laugh track and Jesse’s subtle objection to Joey’s passion for tea parties demonstrates how some sitcom characters exist somewhat as a foil to the heteronuclear family unit. Joey is derided by the other characters in the scene, and by extension the audience, for his breaking of traditional masculine scripts. Elsewhere in the episode, the unattached Joey inadvertently frustrates both Danny’s plans to propose and Jesse’s plans to explore fantasies with his wife. But by the episode’s end, both Danny and Jesse have overcome Joey’s accidental interruptions.  99   That the theme park acts as the backdrop for the family dramedy is hardly a coincidence. These two cultural institutions, the theme park and the sitcom, have a shared history in a way, and both employ and explore a number of similar themes, tropes, narratives, and concepts. Sitcoms and theme parks both exploded in popularity around the mid-1950s. They each had their antecedents in urban spaces, and both migrated to the suburbs—literally and figuratively—during the latter-half of the 1950s.1 Following the premier of sitcoms like Father Knows Best in the mid-1950s and the opening of Disneyland in 1955, both sitcoms and theme parks became synonymous with the heterosexual nuclear family, and arguably the pinnacles of family-friendly media and entertainment. By the 1970s, the two institutions began to overlap more directly, with sitcoms shooting and dedicating entire episodes to family visits to theme parks. Episodes like the two-part season finale of Full House, the Disney World special in Family Matters, and the King’s Island episodes of The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family are but a few examples of the theme park in the American cultural imaginary throughout the latter-half of the twentieth century.2 The two-part finale of Full House was also undoubtedly a marketing move that demonstrated the persistent connections between theme parks and other forms of mass media. Although The Walt Disney Company would not acquire ABC until 1995, the two corporations had a preexisting relationship that                                                      1 For a brief history on this migration in sitcoms in America see “From Domestic Space to Outer Space” in Welcome to the Dreamhouse: Popular Media and Postwar Suburbs by Lynn Spigel (2001), pg. 117-19. 2 See for example The Partridge Family, “I Left My Heart in Cincinnati;” Family Matters, “We’re Going to Disney World;” The Brady Bunch, “Cincinnati Kids,” or any number of sitcom episodes set in theme parks. 100  dated back to the days of Disneyland and The Mickey Mouse Club television shows in the mid-1950s.  As covered in the introduction, heteronormativity in theme parks manifests most clearly in images of the child, and by extension the family, in theming, marketing materials, and broader cultural references to the theme park, such as in movies and sitcoms. This chapter focuses on how Disneyland in particular helped to generate the various cultural associations between the postwar theme park and the American family, and more specifically the child, through their kid-friendly themes, rides, attractions, and shows. It also traces how Disneyland marketed itself and its specific family-friendly brand in various media and periodicals. The family and child of Disneyland’s archetypal guest was deeply gendered, and as such, this chapter also explores how gendered scripts are embedded in the total theme park experience—from marketing materials and other media outside Disneyland to its in-park theming, milieu, and policies.  Faults or slippages within these gendered scripts and representations do occur, but much like the disruptions of Joey and Kimmy in the season finale of Full House, these ruptures are often tools of the fantasy genre that reaffirm gendered binaries and boundaries. Whether by eliciting laughter, disgust, or some other negative affect, these breaches of rigid and binary gendered expectations are rendered abnormal, unnatural, and undesirable in the context of theme parks narrations and performances. While there is ample room between the intention of these theme park narratives and performances and the audience’s reception—which is the subject of chapter four—this chapter argues that Disneyland’s theming and marketing offered guests narrow and heteronormative depictions of gendered scripts. Moreover, Disneyland’s deeply gendered themes and 101  performances were a response to particular postwar concerns about the child. As families across America grew anxious about the role of mass media and consumerism in the education of the child, Disneyland created a new paradigm for child-appropriate consumer, entertainment, and leisure spaces in postwar America. Disneyland also typified the postwar and suburban longing for an imagined past and future in its theming and marketing. Guests could take a sojourn down Mainstreet USA and explore quaint recreations of turn-of-the-century America, or they could see the house of the future near Tomorrowland all in the same day. And, like the suburbs of the 1950s and 1960s, the park gave guests a sense of security through its various landscaping technologies that immersed guests in its themed worlds. Guests could enjoy facsimiles of America’s past and future within the protective berms and impregnable gates of the park, away from the dangers of the outside world. These aspects of Disneyland’s theming and marketing illustrated deeper connections between the function of historical narratives and conceptions of the future in postwar discourses of the child and family—discourses that served to naturalize heteronormative gendered scripts and performances and characterized them as ahistorical. Disneyland conjured up nostalgic pasts and projected auspicious futures with stunning success and insured that the theme parks that followed would have to do the same if they hoped to survive in the postwar consumer and leisure landscape.3    Postwar America during the 1950s was simultaneously a landscape of fierce optimism and profound anxieties over the welfare of the child and youth culture.                                                      3 For more about Disneyland and nostalgia, see Gary Cross’s Consumed Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism, pg. 205. 102  Concerns over the wellbeing of children were a facet of public and popular discourses and culture since well before the 1940s, but with the advent and popularization of television and other forms of mass media, the conversations reached new scales. Parents were uneasy at the thought their kids becoming less reliant on them and on public education as exclusive sources of knowledge about the world around them. Television, cheap comic strips, and other new forms of consumer-oriented media threatened to expose children to objectionable content and objectionable people. Organizations like the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts grew in popularity during the late-1940s and 1950s to give parents a way to monitor their child’s use of leisure time, but parents were scrambling to source methodologies for supervising their child’s access to mass media.4 In response, child psychologists and other pop-scholars and commentators produced volumes on childcare in the age of the television, which were relatively popular throughout the 1950s.5  Lawmakers and civic organizations likewise mobilized to confront the rising popularity of television and other forms of visual media in broader efforts to check youths’ consumption and police youth culture. In 1954, for example, the US Senate hosted a series of hearings through the Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency to investigate a number of media sources and their effects on youth culture and youth crime. Chairman of the Subcommittee, Robert C. Hendrickson (R-NJ), argued that television introduced “ideas that spring into the living room for the entertainment of the youth of                                                      4 Lynn Spigel discusses the Scouts as institutions for child-safe leisure in Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 189. 5 Benjamin Spock’s Common Sense Book of Baby and Childcare sold over four million copies by 1952, Spigel, Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 191. 103  America, which have to do with crime and with horror, sadism, and sex.”6 Hendrickson’s comment succinctly summarizes some of the concerns that parents had regarding the content of these new forms of media. They feared that these new visual consumer products would expose their children to gratuitous violence and sex in particular.  During the mid-century, comic strips rose in popularity thanks to their relative affordability and the widening of consumer markets for print media. While the Senate Subcommittee addressed a number of issues related to youth culture and crime, the arguments heard and decisions made with regard to comic strips and television shows are of particular importance to theme parks, as they relied heavily on similar visual languages in their theming. Comics publisher William Gaines admitted of his comics that, “I don’t think it does them (kids) a bit of good, but I don’t think it does them a bit of harm, either.”7 This argument underscores the approach that many media producers took during the era—to downplay the significance of their products and their ability to influence young consumers in particular. In the aftermath of the hearings, the comic industry adopted a grading system to regulate content internally. Television content creators already had a similar doctrine in the National Association of Broadcasters’ Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters, but like the Comics Code, it was an internal system of review and regulation, though one that worked throughout the 1950s into the 1980s to curtail scenes of violence and explicit sex on television.8                                                      6 Cited in Spigel’s Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 195.  7 Cited in Amy Kiste Nyberg’s Seal of Approval: The Origins and History of the Comics Code, Volume 1, 1994, pg. 61. 8 For more on the history of the Television Code, see Vincent LoBrutto’s “The Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters,” TV in the USA: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas, Volume 1, 2018.  104  Walt Disney and the Disney brand were cultural fixtures decades before the 1955 opening of Disneyland. Ever since the late-1920s and early-1930s, Disney and his creative team were producing family-friendly cartoons, consumer products, and even feature-length animated films marketed to the American child and family. By the early-1930s, characters like Mickey and Mini Mouse were entering popular culture by way of consumer products like themed glassware and notebooks, as well as through the Mickey Mouse Club, which was a social club of sorts that sent instructional packets for family-friendly community activities throughout the nation.9 Nicholas Sammond, in his work on the concurrent rise of Walt Disney Productions and the professionalization of child rearing in America, argues that Disney (the company and the man) made concerted efforts from the outset to brand themselves and their products as “ostensibly an alternative to unsavory popular media and a prophylactic against their negative effects,” particularly toward children.10 Disney cut his teeth during the burgeoning consumer and mass media markets of the middle decades of the twentieth century alongside the growing presence of and concern over the child-as-consumer.11 As such, by the 1950s, with the opening of Disneyland and the debut of the Disneyland television show—the latter of which won a Peabody for excellence in children’s educational programming that                                                      9 For more about these consumer products in the early-1930s, see Nicholas Sammond, Babes in Tomorrowland: Walt Disney and the Making of the American Child, 1930-1960 (2005), pg. 165-69. 10 Nicholas Sammond, Babes in Tomorrowland: Walt Disney and the Making of the American Child, 1930-1960 (2005), pg. 2.  11 For more on the child-as-consumer in 20th century US history, see Raising Consumers: Children and the American Mass Market in the Early Twentieth Century by Lisa Jacobson, 2004; Longing and Belonging: Parents, Children, and Consumer Culture by Allison J.

Journalists covering the opening ceremonies claimed that Disneyland was “that magical land of fantasy and faraway places from the minds of little children,” and a “land of childish dreams and adult hopes.”13 The opening day speech by Goodwin Knight, then Governor of California, was a surprisingly succinct description of what Disney set out the accomplish with Disneyland. In some ways, his speech was also a summation of postwar optimism in American culture and a quick sketch of how Disneyland was emblematic of those very same postwar cultural mores and values. In his dedication to the park, Knight asserts that, “today is a wonderful day, and all of America is proud as we open Disneyland.” And to his point, many Americans had been anticipating the park’s opening since the early rumination phases in the early-1950s. In Disneyland, Knight states, guests would encounter “a wondrous community with all the charm of the old world and all the ingenuity of the new world.” Here, again, Knight is echoing the potent combination of yearning for the past and hope for the future that came to characterize both Disneyland and America of the 1950s. Knight conjured up pastoral images of small-town America in his dedication, as well, commenting that guests could find “replicas of every town and city in America: stores, libraries, schools, just like your hometown.” Most importantly, Knight assures viewers and listeners that Disneyland                                                      12 “Radio-TV Hi-Lites: Peabody Awards,” Ellis Walker, Los Gatos Daily Times, Los Gatos, California, April 13, 1955, pg. 7.  13 “Dream Realized—Disneyland Opened,” Jerry Hulse, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, July 18, 1955, pg. 1. 106  was “all built by American labor and American capital under the belief that this is a God-fearing and God-loving country.”14 Before exploring the specific themes, rides, attractions and shows of Disneyland, it is useful to pull back and better understand the ways in which Disneyland transformed the theme park experience. John Hench, chief operating officer of WED Enterprises, reflected on Disneyland’s power to stay relevant, even in times of financial downturns, in a Los Angeles Times twenty-year retrospective. He argued that the park maintained its high attendance numbers throughout the late-1960s and into the 1970s Disneyland provided “a reassurance of survival” rather than an escape from “the cares o the day in the times of depression.” He continued, stating that guests walk “through an atmosphere of order and cleanliness and [come] away feeling that things must be all right, after all” because “Disneyland is symbolic that all is right with the world.”15 Part of what separated Disneyland from other parks was its dedication to storytelling. Many of the initial creators behind the parks’ attractions and themed landscapes came from the world of television and movies. As such, their main goal was to create narrative arcs throughout the rides, shows, and other themed elements, or at the very least to maintain thematic continuity in each section. They brought a new kind of visual literacy to traditional elements of the amusement park. Instead of individual spectacles competing for guests’ attention, the Disneyland theme park was constructed around the idea of complimentary attractions.                                                      14 “1955 Disneyland Opening Day [Complete ABC Broadcast],” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuzrZET-3Ew. 15 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C9. 107  A 1978 interview with John Hench is illustrative of some of the guiding principles that he and other designers of Disneyland employed throughout the early stages of park development. One of his most striking reveals is that what theme parks center on the affect of reassurance rather than escapism. As he states, “Entertainment is usually thought of as an escape from problems, an escape from responsibility,” but “what we are selling is not escapism but reassurance.”16 To achieve that sense of reassurance, Hench explains, theme parks pair more soothing architectural and design elements with thrilling rides and attractions. Regarding thrill rides like Space Mountain and the Matterhorn, he argues that Disneyland throws “a challenge at you—not a real menace, but a pseudo-menace, a theatricalized menace—and we allow you to win.”17 Later in the interview, Hench and writer Charlie Haas pass by the pirate ships and skulls in Fantasyland and through to the deceased denizens of the Haunted Mansion attraction as Hench explains how death and dying function in the park. Haas writes from his experience that “it’s necessary to supply threats and disarm them, to defang the worst demons and make a world demonstrably safe for the funny animals to play in.”18  Haas’s interview of Hench also demonstrates how metropolitan logics informed the architectures and themes of Disneyland throughout the early decades. At various points in the interview, Hench argues that Disneyland exhibits an almost euphoric level of harmony for its guests as opposed to what writer Haas calls “the inchoate poetry of a city street.”19 Later in the article, Hench makes a more explicit argument against cities,                                                      16 Charlie Haas, “Disneyland Is Good For You,” New West, December 4, 1978, pg.16.  17 Haas, pg. 16. 18 Hass, pg. 19. 19 Haas, pg. 18. 108  stating that, “In the cities, we’re threatened. We don’t talk to people, we don’t believe everything we hear, we don’t look people in the eye. We don’t trust people. We find ourselves alone.”20 Hench places Disneyland in opposition to the disunity and alienation of the city. As established in chapter one, this sentiment was expressed in America’s move away from the city and toward the suburbs more generally throughout the postwar era.  Bill Henry of The Los Angeles Times held a similar belief as Mayor Knight of California, mused, “Walt is what you might call an American man” whose Disneyland park “will lean heavily on the things which make this a great country.”21 Disney affirmed as much in his own dedication to the park, wherein he states that “Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America.” Those three characteristics of American culture were brought to life in the three main themed areas of the park: Fantasyland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland. Fantasyland was the “land of imagination, hopes and dreams” where “the age of chivalry, magic and make-believe” were “reborn and fairy tales” came true. In Frontierland, guests would “experience the story of our country’s past, the color, romance and drama of frontier America.” It was “a tribute to the faith, courage and ingenuity of our hardy pioneers who blazed the trails and made this progress possible.” Lastly, Tomorrowland, guests would enter “A vista into a world of wondrous ideas signifying man’s achievements” that would offer “new frontiers in science, adventure and ideals.”                                                      20 Haas, pg. 19. 21 “By The Way with Bill Henry.” 109  These dedications echoed many similar sentiments in the broader postwar American culture. They romanticized the past even as they lauded the pioneers of yesterday for surviving the trials and tribulations of early America. They looked gleefully at the future and the potential of man-made inventions to continue to drive progress and secure economic prosperity. Lastly, they celebrated some of the more fantastical elements of classic storytelling that continued to inform the ways in which people understood the world around them.  During the televised celebration of Disneyland’s tenth anniversary, Disney narrates over a pan shot of Main Street USA as Anaheim area high school bands begin their parade march. He states that “there aren’t many main streets left where you can see a parade.”22 Underlying the marketing for Disneyland as an escapist fantasy of America’s past and future was a myth of the disappearing small-town America. Part of the magic of Disney marketing was in convincing audiences that sites like a clean and quaint downtown were vanishing. Oftentimes, this rhetoric of a fading small-town America coincided with a generalized fear or disdain for the world outside Disneyland’s gates altogether. Journalists at the Los Angeles Times called Disneyland “This happy world of wonder within a troubled world.”23 While Disneyland may have sought to replicate something that never really existed in the first place, what mattered was that visitors were willing to suspend their disbelief. It helped that many Americans of the postwar moment had been exposed to this sort of anti-urban rhetoric for nearly a century. But Disney and                                                      22 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 23 “Dream Realized—Disneyland Opens,” Jerry Hulse, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, July 18, 1955, pg. 1. 110  the success of the Disneyland park spoke to the fact that in the postwar moment, many Americans finally had the time and resources available to them to indulge in these anti-urban fantasies wrapped up in equally imaginative narratives of America’s past and future.  During its opening decade, Davy Crockett, “king of the wild frontier” as his theme song would claim, was the star of Frontierland. For the opening day broadcast in Frontierland, he and fellow frontiersman Buddy Ebsen, were heavily featured, cementing their status as emblematic of the themed area. Host Art Linkletter interviews Crockett and his companion at one point, and their conversation is revealing of some of the ways in which Disneyland imagined America’s past. The televised centers around Crockett who recounts the story of his recent encounter with a group of Native Americans. He states that, “Them Redskins was just itching to lift our scalps.” Crockett tells Linkletter and the audience that the “hot breath” of the “those Indians” dried up his wet supply of gunpowder, “and then Ole’ Betsy (Crockett’s rifle) took over.” Then the whole crew breaks into song and dance, singing about “Ole’ Betsy” and the various times it saved Crockett’s skin. “I was riding through the woods/To trade off skins for boughtin’ goods/40 arrows hit a tree/I knew the Sioux were out for me.” He promises that he only draws his gun to “shoot for life and liberty.”24 Crockett’s story highlights many of the themes and motifs that Disney peppered throughout his land dedicated to America’s past. The central theme is the celebration of the life of the frontiersman. In this section of the park, guests would encounter brave                                                      24 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 111  American frontiersman who were on the lookout for hostile Native Americans. It is an oversimplified version of frontier history, even for the 1950s, but it is an oft repeated one. This simplified history was also heavily racialized. The protagonists of the section’s rides and attractions were white men, and the antagonists were Native Americans. The expanded mine train attraction was marketed as a “trip through rugged America.”25 Frontierland also included the Frontierland River attraction, which included man-made river rapids and “real live Indians” to make the ride more exciting and authentic for guests.26 Disney did his best to employ Native Americans as character actors and ride operators in the park’s Indian Village and Indian War Canoe attractions, but this practice was phased out by the 1970s when both attractions were rethemed or removed. Beforehand, though, the park regularly hired non-indigenous actors—sometimes even white men—as substitutes, especially toward the end of the 1960s.27 As the park expanded, into the late-1960s and early-1970s, it added new sections and lands that complemented some of the park’s earlier themed areas. New Orleans Square, for example, was similarly meant to evoke images of America’s past and was heralded as “a faithful recreation of another age” upon opening.28 These additions added a degree of levity to the previous depictions of America’s frontier past with its focus on good Southern food, music, and aesthetics. The Haunted Mansion attraction was added to                                                      25 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 26 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 27 David Koenig, More Mouse Tales, pg. 90-91. 28 “Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow (1968),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 112  New Orleans Square in 1969 with the intent of showcasing a host of new ride technologies and introducing darker, more mature themes to the park. One of the more notorious elements of the ride and its backstory is the hanging of the Ghost Host ride narrator. According to some sources, the Ghost Host was a former pirate who killed his wife after she discovered his incriminating past, and who summarily hanged himself after she haunted and tormented him.29 The specifics of each character’s backstory in the Haunted Mansion attraction are deliberately ambiguous, in part, to keep their cause of death out of sight and out of mind for guests experiencing the attraction. The fate of the Ghost Host, however, is on display for keen-eyed guests, but the scene itself does not get much discussion outside of die-hard fan circles of the ride. Media coverage of the hanging was equally cagey, such as when an article from the Sun-Telegram explained the scene in the first room as, “A scream, a light above. Thunder. A swinging shadow. Relief.”30 The ride is featured in the 1970 Wonderful World Of Disney special, “Disneyland Showtime,” which stars the Osmond Brothers, Kurt Russell, and E. J. Peaker exploring the park before and after their guest performances. The television special shows viewers the moving room and stretching pictures at the attractions point of the entry, but the camera avoids the hanged body of the Ghost Host.31  One exception to the relative lack of coverage occurs in the companion LP record and storybook for the ride. These products were meant to add additional story content and                                                      29 “The History of & Changes to The Haunted Mansion, Disneyland,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPLgL_hGQ1M. 30 “999 Spooks Occupy ‘Mansion,’” The Sun-Telegram, San Bernadino, California, August 16, 1969, pg.

The Haunted Mansion LP and storybook follows a teenage couple, Karen and Mike, after a date as they unwittingly venture into the house. The narrator explains to listeners that “from the rafters a corpse swayed, dangling from a taut rope.” A raven enters the scene and clarifies that “he chose the coward’s way out.”32 This rare description of the hanging scene demonstrates how supplementary materials could have more flexibility in terms of tone and content, and they could add morbid details to the ride’s more cryptic elements. Marketing material and media outlets might have left the scene out of their previews and reviews of the attraction simply to avoid spoilers. Alternatively, the lack of coverage might speak to the fact that although the presence of ghosts in the ride presupposes death, it is still abstracted and out of view. The Ghost Host’s hanging corpse, although a feature of the ride, may have proven too macabre for those publishing stories and content about the family-friendly theme park. New Orleans Square was one of the few themed areas the employed Black cast members as musicians, dancers, and performers, which served to further underscore the racialized nature of all of the park’s theming. White cast members could get jobs as any number of ethnic characters—historical or otherwise—but cast members of color were relegated to a pitiable number of positions in the park. These positions were most frequently for attractions themed around moments of history, imbuing the cultures and                                                      32 “The Haunted Mansion Disneyland (1969),” https://archive.org/details/the-haunted-mansion-disneyland-1969. 114  peoples represented in these themed lands with a pastness in opposition to the guests of the present. Disneyland’s Frontierland celebrated an abstract American past, though one that emphasized colonialism, violence, and romanticism in equal measure. The fact that most of the land’s shows and attractions hinged on violence is all the more ironic considering the concurrent push-back against television and comic books. The lack of opposition to the violence pervading in Frontierland highlighted a number of interrelated assumptions about theme parks and American history. First and foremost, it highlighted that certain kinds of violence were treated as part and parcel of America’s frontier past. That violence was permissible in the Disneyland theme park as opposed to other forms of media because Disney was already a cultural fixture vis-à-vis children’s media and consumer products. Violence in the Disneyland park rarely targeted human character actors, though when it did, it was regularly rendered cartoonish and silly. But this violence was often racialized. Native Americans were depicted as aggressors and white frontiersmen as defenders, and ride narratives positioned guests as pseudo-frontiersmen themselves, drawing clear racial lines between good and evil using tools of acceptable violence. Disneyland balanced a longing for an imagined past with musings about future possibilities with the additions in Tomorrowland in the late-1960s. After the Soviet’s successfully launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, American culture became littered with imagery of space exploration. That imagery was frequently mixed with other American exceptionalism discourses in the context of the Cold War. The fact that the Soviet Union beat the United States to outer space left many Americans incensed or even alarmed that the United States was falling behind in terms of technological 115  advancements. Television shows like The Jetsons and My Favorite Martian were products of this newfound interest in space travel, but they also signaled a growing cultural disdain for and critique of the suburbs. The failure of American ingenuity to keep apace with Soviet space technology was tied to discourses of the failure of the suburbs to actualize postwar American cultural superiority.33 Those same narrative and visual techniques were used in projecting images of the future throughout the park. It blended genuine technical marvels with fabricated and kitschy elements to offer guests a distinctly postwar and suburban vision of the future.34 As such, themes of space travel and future technologies were fraught with deep insecurities and marked enthusiasm simultaneously. Marketing for the attractions of Tomorrowland celebrated the “space-age technology” that formed the backbone of each forthcoming ride, but much like America’s frustrated attempts to fly a rocket to the moon, this section of the park remained the least completed throughout the remainder of the twentieth century.35  Attractions in Tomorrowland during the first ten years like “Circarama, U.S.A,” “Satellite View of America,” and “Rocket to the Moon” showed guests images of America’s past, present and future using the latest cinematic technologies. Most of these attractions also highlighted a specific form of technology either in development or in use in America, like “The World Beneath Us” and the “Aluminum Hall of Fame.” The area also featured standard carnivalesque rides themed around a stylized and kitschy future,                                                      33 Lynn Spigel, “From Domestic Space to Outer Space: The 1960s Fantastic Family Sitcom,” Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 107-113. 34 Lynn Spigel discusses the growth of the particular 1960s futuristic aesthetic in “Portable TV: Studies in Domestic Space Travel,” Welcome to the Dreamhouse, pg. 65. 35 “Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow (1968),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 116  like the “Flying Saucers” and the “Astro Jets.” As mentioned in chapter one, Disneyland’s “city of tomorrow” was made “possible today with the technology and imagination of American industry,” which was made apparent by the numerous corporate sponsorships plastered on many of the rides and attractions in the area.36 American Motors, Delta Airlines, Monsanto, Dutch Boy, and Crane Co. were some of the corporate sponsors that worked their brand images into the themes and narratives of Tomorrowland rides. This area of the park proved to be the most volatile in terms of ride turnover and guest satisfaction throughout the twentieth century, signaling the inherent complexity of keeping rides and attractions themed around a yet-to-be future fresh and exciting for guests. Tomorrowland was perhaps best at capturing a particular postwar vision of the future: one that overemphasized space travel as a defining feature of future America and blended faith in American industry with anxieties about falling behind the technological curve. Unlike Frontierland and other sections of the park, Tomorrowland was meant to replicate a bustling metropolis of the future. It was “a world on the move” according to park promotional material, and its signature attraction, the People Mover, was “designed for intermediate speed transportation within cities.”37 This “scenic highway in the sky” seemed to contradict the antiurban tenets that informed the location and spatial logics of Disneyland, but as was the case with the facsimile of small-town America and the western frontier, Disneyland’s future urban world was highly sanitized. The section’s                                                      36 “Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow (1968),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 37 “Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow (1968),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 117  rides and attractions were coated in the kind of sterile white mixed with pops of vibrant color that would come to define futuristic aesthetics of the 1960s—think: the space station from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Also, if the other lands of Disneyland were somewhat multicultural, with character actors portraying Native Americans, ethnic whites, and Black men and women, the future as depicted in Tomorrowland was decidedly white. Although it is nigh impossible to tell with any certainty the exact make-up of cast members in the Tomorrowland area, one would be hard-pressed to find employees of color in any photographs and marketing material from the 1950s and 1960s.    America’s future as shown in Tomorrowland was a land of consumerism. Many of the sponsored exhibits, like those found at the end of the section’s Journey thru Inner Space ride, showed how corporations like Monsanto and The Bell System were improving home life and consumer goods. As the land’s most iconic attraction, the People Mover, moved though the Disneyland Character Shop, the narrator stated that, “It’s the modern way to window shop.”38 The Monsanto House of the Future, which operated from 1957 to 1967, best illustrated this overlap in Tomorrowland between American industry, technological advancements, consumer convenience, and family life. Kitchens featured ultrasonic dishwashers, microwave ovens, and retractable storage to make cooking and cleaning a breeze. Living and bedrooms featured multipurpose furniture, and bathrooms showed off adjustable wash basins, all of which served to fit a family of four with two growing children. Although Bob Cummings promised that Tomorrowland was “not a stylized dream of the future, but a scientifically planned                                                      38 “Disneyland: From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow (1968),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 118  projection of future techniques by leading space experts and scientists,” the themed landscape was firmly rooted in the stylistics and aesthetics of a particular postwar vision of America’s future.  Disneyland quickly became the foremost family-oriented tourist attraction in the nation, or at least that is what marketing materials and park promoters would argue throughout the first decade of the park’s operation. During those first ten years, the park played host to a number of famous families, both from the United States and from abroad. Then-Vice President Richard Nixon, his wife, and their two daughters were at the head of the parade on opening day for Disneyland’s 1959 season.39 Later that year, Nikita Khrushchev was supposed to visit Disneyland with his son, son-in-law, and two daughters, but the family ended up venturing to the park without the Russian Premier due to some undisclosed security issue.40 In 1959, and then again in 1981, King Hussein bin Talal of Jordan visited the theme park with his wife and their two sons.41 Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife and kids attended the park in December of 1961, where Eisenhower stated, “I suppose you might say I’m enjoying this as much as the children—no, more.”42 In total, it was estimated that by 1965 alone, “11 kings and queens, 23                                                      39 “Nixons Lead Parade at Disneyland Dedication,” Charles Hillinger, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, June 15, 1959, pg. 1. 40 “Khrushchev Family To Visit Disneyland,” Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, September 19, 1959, pg. 6. 41 “Day of Play for Hussein Entourage,” Ronald L. Soble and Larry Stammer, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. C1. 42 “Six Hours Of Fun: Eisenhowers, family Guests at Disneyland,” Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, December 27, 1961, pg. 2. 119  presidents, prime ministers and other heads of state, 25 princes and princesses” had passed through the park gates.43 One way that Disneyland appealed to families of the postwar era was by assuring them that the park itself was, first and foremost, safe for them and their children. Leo E. Litwaklos of the Los Angeles Times declared in 1965 that Disneyland was “more secure than ancient Troy.” He lauded the park’s security, arguing that “No Trojan horse will get into Disneyland” because “Guards at the main gate closely scrutinize all who enter,” so much so that “Not even an unseemly teenager will get past them.”44 Disneyland maintained its bucolic sense of safety and security surprisingly well throughout the twentieth century. Disney himself once stated that, “I tell my security police, for instance, that they never are to consider themselves cops. They are there to help people.” In other words, as with many other arenas of park policy, Disney recognized that optics were a large part of ensuring guests’ feelings of safety. As Nunis clarified, Disney “did not feel visitors should be hampered by shows of force,” and so guns, clubs, and other typical visual signals of security personnel were forbidden. But that control over appearances naturally did not stop at the park’s security team. Up until the 1970s, men with long hair were not permitted into the park. Prohibitions against long hair were allegedly an unwritten rule but was nonetheless quietly enforced until sometime near 1970.45                                                      43 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” Leo E. Litwaklos, New York Times, New York, New York, June 27, 1965, pg. SM22. 44 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM22. 45 Many articles discussing the policy argue that it predated the Yippie invasion, despite stories that state otherwise. As the rule was unwritten, it is hard to find a start and end date to the policy, but writers point out that the Yippie men would not have made it in the gate in 1970 if the policy were still in place, see, “Long Haired Men, Employee Mustaches Were Banned From Disneyland For Decades,” Kellar Ellsworth Groovy 120  Likewise, any displays of the American flag on clothing that was deemed “inappropriate” was grounds for dismissal from the park, as was any number of other “offensive” clothing choices.46 Shortly after removing its policies against long hair on men, the park encountered its biggest security challenge to date. On August 1, 1970, the park experienced its first and arguably only instance of large-scale protesting within its gates. For “Yippie Day,” as it was called, “Several hundred long-haired youths swarmed into the park,” where they “hurled obscenities at some of the 30,000 other visitors and were involved in several confrontations with the guards.” Park officials knew about the planned events in advance, but they decided to keep the park open for part of the day because, as Dick Nunis said, to do otherwise would be to play “into the hands of the radicals.”47  These gendered policies on guests’ appearance and dress were only one of the ways in which the park generated and reinforced heteronormative scripts throughout the park. The most pervasive examples of heteronormative gendered scripts in the park’s theming and marketing material were in depictions or references to courtship rituals and heterosexual romance. As early as the very first opening day broadcast, Disneyland was marketed as a place for couples to come and spend the day. Art Linkletter, who hosts the majority of the Disneyland opening day broadcast, remarks that guests could go to the Ole’ Time Music Shop on Mainstreet USA, and if “you were courting a gal, that’s where                                                      History, August 25, 2019, https://groovyhistory.com/disneyland-banned-men-with-long-hair-50s-60s, “Disneyland Long Hair Prohibition,” David Mikkelson, April 22, 2000, https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hair-today/. 46 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C9. 47 “Disney’s ‘Magical Little Park’ After Two Decades,” pg. OC_C8 – C9. 121  you’d buy your mandolin or your banjo and start tuning it up for the Sunday canoe ride.”48 “And if you were daring, you might go out with your girl for a ride in an 1898 locomobile.” In the segment on Tomorrowland, Linkletter quips that the women drivers are given extra space on the track at Autopia.49 These comments reinforce traditional heteronormative gendered expectations in courting rituals, wherein the man is the active pursuer and the woman his object of desire, with a quick jab at women’s inability to drive thrown in for good measure.  These heteronormative gendered scripts were also embedded in ride narratives and other thematic elements throughout the park. One of the more infamous early attractions at Disneyland was the Pirates of the Caribbean boat ride that premiered at the park in 1967.50 On opening day, the park hosted a reenactment of a battle at sea on the man-made river outside of New Orleans Square, where actors dressed as pirates boarded and raided the Disney steamship, Columbia. The pirates threw other character actors overboard and raised the Jolly Roger flag to the cheers of non-participating passengers aboard the ship. Characteristic of fictional representations of pirates, the raiders returned from below deck with their treasure, hoisting screaming and flailing women over their shoulders or dragging them to the deck by the ropes around their wrists. The pirates, the women, and reporters alike drink and dance and laugh together on the deck of the ship as a band plays. One video clip from the 1968 episode of The Magical World of Disney                                                      48 “1955 Disneyland Opening Day [Complete ABC Broadcast],” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuzrZET-3Ew. 49 “1955 Disneyland Opening Day [Complete ABC Broadcast],” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuzrZET-3Ew. 50 From the Disneyland website, https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disneyland/pirates-of-the-caribbean/. 122  shows one pirate poking and prodding a woman reporter with his sword while another spanks one of the captured women on the behind with his. The narrator interjects, adding that “For the pirates and their prisoners, victory at sea was only a prelude to pleasure on shore.”51  In retrospect, the whole scene seems uncharacteristic of the family-friendly brand and image of Disneyland. But the ride opened to mostly positive fanfare from journalists at the time. One author in the Chicago Tribune commented that no ride or attraction would “delight Disneyland guests more than setting sail with the rowdiest crew of blackhearted buccaneers ever assembled.”52 One other writer for the Los Angeles Times commented after opening day that “For the good guys at Disneyland, things will never be the same,” cheering on the addition of the ride.53 These rave reviews are all the more surprising considering the content of the auction scene that occurs approximately halfway through the ride’s duration.54 During this scene, the pirates auction off the women of the ransacked town to the guests as their boats pass by. The pirate captain asks the crew and passengers, “What be I offered for this winsome wench? Shift your cargo deary. Show ‘em your larboard side. Strike your colors, you brazen wench. No need to expose your superstructure.”55 The following scene depicts pirates chasing after fleeing women “She                                                      51 The Magical World of Disney, “From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the World of Tomorrow,” (1968), 13:16 – 15:25, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_NTvnZ6s9A. 52 “Tomorrowland Readied for Disneyland Visitors,” Chicago Tribune, April 23, 1967, pg.

He turns to the audience and tells them, “I be willing to share, I be.” Another animatronic woman pops hurriedly in and out of a barrel during his narration, suggesting that she is the “wench” in question. For the tenth anniversary special episode of the Wonderful World of Color in 1965, Disney himself describes the layout of the Pirates ride as the camera pans over replicas of the coming attraction. When it gets to the scene in question, Disney narrates, where the rum-drinking band of pirates gawked across the river at their shipmates who were “auctioning off the town beauties.” The camera zooms in on the largest of women statuettes as Disney quips, “and there’s the biggest bargain of all.”56  Throughout the attraction, the pirates are the prototypical anti-hero. They are the protagonists of the ride in a way, but their loose morals—especially around alcohol—and cheeky misogyny get them in trouble by the ride’s end, when drunken pirates shoot and set off kegs of explosives. Their booty is now floating in the sea as the guests speed off toward the loading dock. As voyagers on their own boat, guests are caught in the crossfire between the pirates and the inhabitants of the town under siege, which helps to partly explain how the miscreant pirates get away with such unsavory references to sex and booze. The guests are not made to identify with the pirates in as clear terms as they are in other attractions, and the pirates are effectively punished for their depraved behavior in the context of the ride’s narrative. But the pirates are likewise not the clear and away villains of the narrative. Guests are made to laugh at their antics, but they are                                                      56 “Disneyland’s 10th Anniversary (1965),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3BIWJ9QmZs. 124  seen as permissible given the nature of pirates. Taken together, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride features some of the most unabashed references to sex and alcohol, but these otherwise unwholesome elements are rendered tolerable in Disney’s family-friendly land of adventure. Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room debuted at Disneyland in 1963. It was an unprecedented showcase of Disney’s audio animatronic technology, with the attraction boasting over 225 individual bird performers at its opening.57 Like other attractions of its kind, the Enchanted Tiki Room featured a mix of narration and song alongside other visual storytelling elements. Its earliest iterations featured José the parrot as the primary narrator who was joined by a collection of macaws, toucans, and other avian friends. Each character represented a person from another nation, and in early-Disney fashion, these characters were heavy-accented, cartoonish caricatures of people. After singing the first chorus of the song, “The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,” three of the secondary characters, Fritz, Pierre, and Michael would trade insults about one another’s singing capabilities, or lack thereof. José, charged with keeping the show on the rails, would attempt to diffuse the tension by chastising the group, stating, “Mi amigos, stop the clucking. You sound like a bunch of old hens.”58 José’s quick jab about gender roles is another example of Disneyland’s use of humor in their attractions and narrations. As with the auction scene                                                      57 Attraction information pulled from the Disneyland website, https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/magic-kingdom/enchanted-tiki-room/. 58 From the 50th anniversary Disneyland Happiest Homecoming on Earth audio CD, track 5, “The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,” (1963). 125  in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, José’s quip about men behaving like women reinforces gendered scripts and expectations.59  The script for Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise, one of the park’s most iconic and enduring attractions, included a handful of references to the animals of the attraction that, much like the Enchanted Tiki Room, assigned value to their gendered performances. In the televised expedition for the 1956 “A Trip Through Adventureland” special, the skipper draws guests’ attention to “a lonesome lady elephant calling to her mate” and another animatronic across the river, “her lord and master.” As the boat rounds the bend, the skipper adds, “well, let’s leave the happy couple and head toward the falls.”60 As the boat approaches the loading station at the end of the ride, cast members were guided to quip, “Now comes the most dangerous part of our journey…civilization and the California freeways…and women drivers. Oh…and by the way men, if your mother-in-law is still aboard, you’ve missed your golden opportunity.”61 These jokes about in-laws and women drivers echo earlier jokes in the Enchanted Tiki Room inasmuch as they make feminine qualities the butt of the joke. But the jokes toward women were not all disparaging. For example, in the supplemental scripts, skippers were offered a line for the “Nile Elephants” section of the ride where they would state, “And on the right, this is                                                      59 There’s something to be said here about the targets of José’s joke—ostensibly French and German men—vis-à-vis stereotypes of European men. For more about Disney’s use of accents and their relation to broader cultural values, see Rosina Lippi-Green’s “Teaching Children How to Discriminate: What We Learn from the Big Bad Wolf,” English with an Accent: Language, Ideology, and Discrimination in the United States, 1997, pg. 79-103. 60 “A Trip Through Adventureland,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMKcxUyKx0o. 61 “Disneyland Jungle Cruise Script,” May 22, 1963, Internet Archive community text, https://archive.org/details/jungle-cruse-disneyland/page/n9/mode/2up. 126  obviously his mate…you can tell because she is better looking.”62 While the focus of this last joke is on the unkempt appearance of the male elephant, it also pokes fun at women for settling for unattractive partners. There were undoubtedly countless other improvised lines of gendered humor throughout the Jungle Cruise attraction, as skippers had a degree of agency in narrating individual trips around the man-made river. One last example echoing the return trip quip from earlier stated, “By the way, ladies and gentlemen, if your mother-in-law is aboard, you might be interested in our (time) special…half way for half far…no questions asked. Bring the wife too, we’ll make it a package deal.”63 The Monsanto-sponsored attraction “Adventure Thru Inner Space” featured a showroom at the ride’s conclusion. Accompanying the attraction was a purchasable booklet that outlined the ride and celebrated some of Monsanto’s technological innovations. The “Home Furnishings,” “Transportation,” and “Construction” panels discuss described a host of products that Monsanto’s research helped to create, like nylon cords, fire resistant hydraulic fluids, asphalt, laminated glass, and various plastics for other household uses. Each blurb comes with a kitschy illustration, and these three in particular feature heterosexual pairs getting married, traveling with kids, or casually flirting.64 Tomorrowland’s AstroJet attraction had a catchy theme song about soaring into outer space. It included a line telling passengers, “Gents hug your gals/it’s cold up                                                      62 “Disneyland Jungle Cruise Script: Supplementary Narration Material,” pg. 2, https://archive.org/details/jungle-cruse-disneyland/page/n13/mode/2up. 63 Disneyland Jungle Cruise Script: Supplementary Narration Material,” pg. 5, https://archive.org/details/jungle-cruse-disneyland/page/n15/mode/2up. 64 “Adventure Thru Inner Space Booklet (1967), pg. 6-7, https://archive.org/details/inner-space-booklet-01-images/page/7/mode/2up. 127  there!”65 During the waterfall sequence on the aforementioned Jungle Cruise attraction, just before the climactic journey through the river rapids, skippers occasionally gave pause to “give those young couples a chance to, well, look into one another’s eyes, and perhaps hold those hands a little tighter for a moment.”66 These few examples remind us that heterosexual coupling was integral to Disneyland ride narratives, whether it was in official pieces of marketing material or in the improvisational commentary of skippers and other cast members.  As with other elements of theming, music and sound are integral. Most of Disneyland’s music is produced in-house by the Walt Disney Music Company. And as with other visual and auditory elements of theming, Disneyland’s music sets the mood for the various sections of the park. They run the gamut in terms of styles with most being instrumental music for the purposes of ambience, but some Disneyland originals are songs with descriptive or narrative lyrics. Like the music, the songs of Disneyland tend to be whimsical and humorous above all. But some songs piped through the park’s walkways are suffused with narrative or descriptive elements worth analyzing for their commentary on romance, pleasure, work, and play. For example, the Mellomen Barber Shop Quartet’s “Meet me Down on Main Street,” which has played in the Main Street USA section of the park since 1957, talks of enjoying a date night in the park with parades, popcorn, and chocolate bars. The song, which is decidedly less upbeat than the other Main Street staple, “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” is nonetheless warm and merry.                                                      65 “An Adventure in the Magic Kingdom,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFW_vHTeVtE. 66 “A Trip Through Adventureland,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMKcxUyKx0o. 128  The lyrics are a wholesome blend of advertisements for Main Street attractions and wares and of courtship rituals. Between crooning about horse-drawn carriages and the firemen’s band, the four men declare that their date will “be the sweetest girl by far down on old Main Street.” Taken together, these lyrics cement that Main Street USA is the place to be for nighttime entertainment and heterosexual romance.67 Aside from the opening day special, Disneyland regularly hosted anniversary events with a concurrent broadcast special on the Wonderful World of Disney. The 1974 “Sandy in Disneyland” special episode of The Wonderful World of Disney starred Sandy Duncan as she toured the park and performed alongside a number of character actors and brand mascots. For the opening number, she sings along as Mickey Mouse conducts the orchestra, crooning, “No two people have ever been so in love” as Mickey takes a break from conducting to sway side-by-side with her. Donald Duck runs on stage and asks to join the two, prompting Duncan to amend the previous verse to say, “No three people have ever been so in love.” As the scene continues, more and more mascots join and plead for her affection, and eventually the polycule grows to comprise twelve characters, including all seven dwarves. The bit begins as a standard song about an interspecies heterosexual coupling but quickly subverts audiences’ expectations and flirts with interspecies polyamory.  Aside from this musical introduction, the rest of the episode and Duncan’s journey through the park is par for the course with its mix of comedy, romance, and star-studded cameos. In another, Duncan is joined by John Davidson, and the two sing and                                                      67 “Meet Me Down On Main Street,” The Mellomen Barbershop Quartet, Walt Disney Music Company, 1957.  129  dance and flirt all the way down Mainstreet USA. Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina compete to see who will kiss Sleeping Beauty out of her slumber. Lorne Greene unintentionally walks hand-in-hand with a caveman and calls him darling, mistaking the caveman for Duncan. In one scene, Ruth Buzzi plays a domineering wife dragging her timid husband, played by Ted Knight through the park and into King Arthur’s Court. She snaps, “You would never have survived in a world like this! This is when men were men,” because they “had courage,” “stamina,” and “fortitude.” She asserts that, “The trouble with you is you’re not aggressive,” and chastises him for lacking the courage to “fight your way to the top.” Her criticisms set up for the punch line, where Knight draws the sword from the stone and fights off character actor combatants as Buzzi chows on a chicken wing and carries on castigating him.68  Disneyland’s televised specials throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were reflective of trends in media at the intersection of family entertainment and theme parks that would persist throughout the remainder of the decade. Just like the two-part season finale of Full House in 1993, these earlier TV specials invariably featured heteronormative romance and gendered scripts as they explored the lands of fantasy, past, and future. They helped to illustrate how theme parks were beginning to be understood in popular culture in America. These were sites where every member of the family could find joy and fun because they appealed to broad notions of childhood, both in actual children and in harkening back to childhood memories for old generations. Despite their best efforts, though, Disneyland struggled to engage the demographic for whom                                                      68 “Sandy in Disneyland (1974),” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrVH_W5wOIQ. 130  childhood and all things associated with it were a prison they had recently escaped: teenagers. In these early television specials and in later sitcoms, though, Disneyland would find its solution, doubling down on romance and heterosexual courtship as the primary marketing strategy to attract teens and young adults.    News outlets covering the Andrew Ross Exler case versus Disneyland discussed in the introduction mentioned that Disneyland employees were enforcing a park policy dating back to 1957. The policy in question came about during the Summer of 1957, when park executives were looking for a way to attract more teenagers and young adults to the family-friendly amusement center. Their solution was to begin hosting Disneyland “Date Nites.” Starting on June fourteenth, 1957, and lasting until September fifteenth, the park would stay open until one in the morning on Fridays and Saturdays, adding an additional three hours of nighttime merriment for parkgoers.69 According to Eddie Meck, a publicist for Disneyland, “The idea of Date Night is that teenagers can dance to good music for 70 cents a person plus the price of a couple of soft drinks and a hot dog.”70 Advertisements for the event promised, “Dancing…Romantic Rides. Fun! Thrills! Excitement!” and proclaimed that, “If it’s dancing you want…we have it.”71 Pictures from these advertisements and other media coverage featured couples of men and women or boys and girls riding rides and dancing together at the Plaza Gardens.                                                      69 “Disneyland’s ’57 Summer Schedule Set,” Valley Times, North Hollywood, California, June 8, 1957, pg. 9. The event seems to have been extended until at least October 12th for the 1957 Summer season. 70 Quote from article, “Date Night at Disneyland Spells Fun for Pat and Don,” Independent Press-Telegram, Long Beach, California, September 1, 1957, pg. B3. 71 “Date Nite at Disneyland” advertisement, 1957, https://blog.retroplanet.com/date-nite-disneyland/,. “Date Nite” advertisement, 1957, https://www.pinterest.es/pin/778489485557742444/. 131  According to park officials reflecting on the original park mandate, the intent of limiting dancing to men-women pairs was to protect park guests. According to a United Press International article from the 1984 ban lift, Richard Nunis, then President of Disneyland, stated that the 1957 rule was “intended to stop a person from cutting in on another couple and possibly starting a fight.”72 Another article from the Philadelphia Gay News paraphrases Nunis’ court testimony, stating that “the real concern had to do with pairs of women overtaking the dance floor,” because “it was common for two women to dance together in public if they had no men to dance with them.”73 Whether or not the “Date Nite” dance policy was intended to police potential homosexual pairings is the subject of chapter four, but what the policy highlighted was a broader underlying anxiety about teens and young adults in the park.    Events like Disneyland’s “Date Nite” demonstrated how theme park promoters struggled to attract and incorporate teenage and young adult visitors into their family-friendly spaces, especially during the first few decades of operation. It goes without saying that families regularly include teenaged children, but older, more autonomous teens and young adults were harder to pin down for the parks. Likewise, as the earlier discussion of the early-1950s Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency revealed, teenagers typically carried with them broader anxieties about sex, violence, and other such behaviors that did not fit comfortably into the family-friendly atmosphere of theme                                                      72 “Judge affirms ‘gay dancing’ alright at Disneyland,” Sheila Grissett-Welsh, UPI, June 29, 1984, https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/29/Judge-affirms-gay-dancing-alright-at-Disneyland/3729457329600/. 73 “Until legal ruling, Disneyland banned same-sex dancers,” Matthew S.

Many outside commentators celebrated “Date Nite” and the equally popular “Grad Night” celebrations, where “properly chaperoned” teens and young adults spent a night in the park to commemorate their recent high school and college graduations. As one article states, “Local police have congratulated Disneyland for turning ordinarily difficult nights into safe and sober occasions.”74  Barbara Jo Willcockson echoed this sentiment in her article about “Date Night” for the Los Angeles Times, where she writes that the “minimum cost and the complete absence of liquor anywhere on the premises” helped to keep the event “trouble-free.” She adds that, “An adult could give serious thought to how difficult that combination is to find in our metropolitan area.” Her concluding comment that “Wholesome may be a word frowned on by teenagers, but we can’t think of a better one” reinforces that these types of events partly defied expectations by attracting rambunctious teenagers into family-friendly spaces without incident.75 In 1965, conservative Superintendent of Public Instruction for California, Max Rafferty, stated that Walt’s movies and theme park, “have become lone sanctuaries of decency and health in the jungle of sex and sadism created by Hollywood producers of pornography…The beatniks and degenerates think his films are square. I think they are wonderful.”76 His comments signaled that for parents, schoolteachers, and other protectors of proper morality and youth culture, Disneyland and the Disney brand were a safe bet for wholesome content. Naturally, then, teenagers and                                                      74 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM26. 75 “Fountain of Youth Overflows With Disneyland Date Nighters.”  76 Rafferty quoted in, “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” Leo E. Litwaklos, New York Times, New York, New York, June 27, 1965, pg. SM26. 133  young adults avoided the park like the plague outside of these events that specifically targeted their demographic.  Outside outlets applauded the park for giving teens a safe alternative to more tawdry youth urban leisure and amusement sites, but anecdotes and rumors maintain that conniving teens found ways of thwarting park rules against alcohol and public displays of affection. For “Grad Nites,” guests would sneak bottles of booze in past security, and when park supervisors started patting down attendees for the events, they would arrive earlier in the day and stash bottles and cans in the shrubs of Autopia or in small items lockers.77 “Grad Nites” were also notorious for instances of teen sex and romance. Former park employee Dayna Budde stated that, “At the end of the night, we’d find pantyhose, panties and condoms all over the Motor Boat ride.”78 Teens stowed away in dark corners on attractions during normal operating hours, as well. Journey Thru Inner Space was lovingly renamed “Voyage through InterCourse,” but virtually any attraction with individual ride cars and low light was a candidate for young romantics, such as when one park attendant allegedly found a wrapped condom on one of the bobsleds at the Matterhorn ride.79 Young cast members also recalled stories of hookups in the hidden corridors of attractions like Journey Thru Inner Space and Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. They allegedly created a “Top of the Mountain Club” to commemorate cast members that had sex in the attic of the Matterhorn.80 Disneyland officials wrestled with unruly teens                                                      77 David Koenig, Mouse Tales, pg. 168-69. 78 Quoted in Koenig, Mouse Tale, pg. 170. 79 Koenig, Mouse Tales, pg. 171, 125. 80 Koenig, Mouse Tales, pg. 131. 134  throughout the years, but it continued to try to court these visitors throughout the 1960s and 1970s when the teenage consumer market became increasingly lucrative.   This trend of Disneyland planners struggling to pin down the teen market would continue throughout the twentieth century, but it came to a head again in the mid-1980s. At this time, annual park attendance was slumping, but the teenage demographic in particular were finding alternative hang-out spots in the Southern California region in droves. In 1984, for example, nearby Knott’s Berry Farm opened Cloud 9 and Studio K, two dance clubs aimed at attracting a teen audience. To the chagrin of then-Disney CEO, Michael Eisner, the two clubs were an immediate hit. As Kevin Perjurer of the hit YouTube series, Defunctland, points out, most of Eisner and company’s solutions to solving the attendance problems, particularly among teenagers, were medium or long-term fixes, or projects that would take years to complete.81 Among those solutions was a planned Star Wars attraction, aimed at capitalizing on the success of the franchise among teens and young adults in particular, but even though the ride was fast-tracked, its estimated opening was still down the road in Summer 1986.82 Knott’s Berry Farm had found the short-term solution, and by all accounts—except for the official Disneyland account, of course—Disney took the Knott’s blueprint and opened their own teen nightclub, Videopolis, the following year. Spokespeople for the park claimed that “such a move has been considered for years,” but was rejected previously because park officials                                                      81 For a stellar review of Videopolis and Disneyland’s struggles with teen crowds in the 1980s, see “Defunctland: The History of Disneyland’s Teen Nightclub, Videopolis,” Kevin Perjurer, February 1, 2020, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAAamVPS9QA. 82 “Disneyland: Park to Plunge Into Teen Market,” Bruce Horovitz, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, April 23, 1985, pg. R5. 135  were “worried that the park’s family image could be harmed by encouraging teen-age traffic.” The “multimillion-dollar teen nightclub” was part of “an all-out push for the lucrative teen-age market.”83 A rotating cadre of DJs played the latest radio hits, and giant screens showed the accompanying music videos. Roving camera operators would record and broadcast dancers onto the video screens, as well, giving bolder teens the opportunity to show off their moves.   Bob McTyre, who was the manager of marketing at the time for the park, maintained that “Our first concern is to keep Disney a family place, but there are a lot of good kids in Orange County who want a place to go.”84 Planners and spokespeople for the nightclub expressed concerns over attracting “rowdy crowds” both before and during the club’s initial years. And their fears were not entirely unfounded, as in 1985, when two large brawls took place between alleged rival teen gangs outside both Knott’s Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain.85 Disneyland did its best to get out in front of the issue before the opening of Videopolis by asking suspected gang members to mover their “colors” before entering the park, and after the nightclub opened, they were keen to increase security in and around the park to defuse or deter any incidents. Part of the reason why these events were without any major incidences was because, as mentioned before, the park had a strict, if inconspicuous security enforcement team. Likewise, the presence of roving camera operators on and around the dancefloor                                                      83 “Disneyland Will Open Teen Nightclub,” Bruce Horovitz, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, April 23, 1985, pg. R1.  84 “Disneyland: Park to Plunge Into Teen Market,” pg. R5. 85 “Parks gear up for gangs,” Tulare Advance-Register, Tulare, California, July 8, 1985, pg. 8. 136  may have been a deterrent in some cases. For comparison, Knott’s Berry Farm’s Studio K had more lax security policies and protocols during the mid-1980s. As such, Disneyland’s competitor remained the go-to attraction for many Orange County teens. While outside commentators concluded that Studio K remained popular because of cheaper ticket prices, this aspect of the club complemented its existing reputation as the cooler, more carefree option of the theme park teen hangouts. McTrye’s above comment about “good kids in Orange County” is also a reminder that a large, consistent portion of attendance figures came from locals, and these locals—at least in the case of Disneyland—were white. As detailed in chapter one, statements like these are a reminder of the ways in which Disneyland was simultaneously an international titan of family-friendly travel and leisure and deeply indebted and attuned to the local community. That local community, though, tended to be divided along lines of race and class. Despite the fact that, as explored in chapter one, Anaheim began as a relatively homogenous community and Disneyland, consequently, saw white and middle-class guests enter the gates to a larger degree than any other demographic, more and more people of color and people of the working class found a home in Anaheim, especially as the park and surrounding tourism industries began employing them in greater numbers. Regardless, Disneyland and Videopolis remained a popular hangout spot for white Orange County teens as opposed to their competitors Studio K and Cloud 9, which were 137  “the club destination for teens queer and proto-queer, Caucasian and of color” in the mid-1980s and early-1990s.86    Like many theme parks, the employees of Disneyland— “cast members”—were given near-identical uniforms and had to follow rigid grooming and dress rules and regulations. Despite the fact that, as early as the 1960s, menswear and womenswear brands were coopting and incorporating images and rhetoric of the cultural “rebel” and other lightly countercultural figures, Disneyland’s dress and grooming policies remained relatively unchanged throughout the early decades.87 Many news outlets came to refer to the aesthetic requirements of Disneyland cast members as the “Disneyland Look,”—later just the “Disney Look.” One of Disneyland’s staffing personnel—perhaps casting agent would be more accurate—Van A. France, stated that “Men with dirty fingernails, ducktail haircuts and unshined shoes have little chance of matriculating” through Disneyland University, the park’s bootcamp for casting and training employees. He added that “Disneyland wants its young personnel to look like the girl or boy next door—a look of cleanliness and wholesomeness is its trademark.”88  In the wake of 1960s youth countercultural movements against the doldrums of suburban conformity, park officials may have relaxed policing on guests’ dress and                                                      86 See Karen Tongson’s chapter “Behind the Orange Curtain,” Relocations: Queer Suburban Imaginaries, pg. 71-111, for a deeper exploration about race and theme park dance clubs in the 80s and 90s. 87 For more on advertising in the clothing and fashion industry, see Thomas Frank’s The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism, 1997, pg. 208-12. 88 Van A. France quoted in “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM26. 138  appearance—allowing men with long hair to enter the park was one such accommodation—but they were hesitant to extend those concessions to cast members. In 1988, the Los Angeles Times ran a short periodical discussing Disney’s dress code policies as they applied to the newly acquired Disneyland Hotel and to the park itself. In the article, it states that Disneyland’s dress code and grooming policies for cast members remained relatively unchanged since its opening day. It opens by jokingly asking, “If the animated Mr. Lincoln at Disneyland were as alive as he seems, would he have to shave?” It notes that the park’s management team “bans mustaches, beards and long hair for male employees and eye shadow, long fingernails and dangling earrings for women because visitors expect the staff to be wholesome and well-scrubbed.” It also quips that “Michael Jackson, who wears more eye makeup than the Disneyland rules allow female employees, has a toehold inside the Magic Kingdom as Captain EO.” The article concludes that the park has “outdated standards,” and that “Americans are more tolerant, less likely to believe that trim mustaches or long, well-groomed nails bespeak moral corruption.”89 Steve Mittman of San Pedro asked readers of the Los Angeles Times if “Might we infer then that Disneyland management does not consider Walt Disney to have been a ‘wholesome and well-scrubbed’ person” on account of his iconic mustache.90 Warren J. McCabe of Los Angeles responded to the original article, as well, stating that “Disneyland has a right as a private employer to demand going by the rules set up by                                                      89 “Mickey Mouse Standards,” Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, March 10, 1988, pg. 6. 90 “Letters to The Times: Dress Code,” Steve Mittman, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, March 20, 1988, pg. 4 139  management and any employee who will not conform should get another job.”91 These comments are a reminder that, while Disneyland exercised absolute control over the dress and appearance of its employees and guests, their policies and attitudes were the subject of public debate and discourse. Disneyland officials also assigned young men and women cast members to specific attractions according to assumptions about masculinity and femininity of some of the park’s themed areas. For example, although most boat rides were operated by young men, the Storybook Land Canal Boats were driven by young women. Underlying these assignments were gendered assumptions about driving and narrating certain stories. Men were the de facto drivers of Jungle Cruise boats and the Submarine Voyage submarines, but there was something feminizing about the wholesome stories of the Fantasyland attraction. Former employee John Catone affirmed that “The Storybook spiel was for a woman.” As the attraction’s foreman, however, he would occasionally step in and chauffer guests, and “even in 1956,” men would flirt with him and tease him about going on dates.92 By contrast, train conductors for the Frontierland Mine Train attraction were primarily men, and although the ride had a prerecorded spiel, operators were encouraged to intersperse their own narratives alongside the canned story.93 Most of Frontierland’s character actors were young men, as it aligned with assumptions about the rugged nature of America’s West of the past and the gender of those occupying the landscape.                                                      91 “Letters to The Times: Dress Code,” Warren J. McCabe, Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, March 20, 1988, pg. 4. 92 David Koenig, More Mouse Tales, pg. 37. 93 Koenig, More Mouse Tales, pg. 88-89. 140  Disneyland’s dress code and appearance policies mapped gendered expectations onto the bodies of cast members and made them some of the most visible signifiers of gendered difference throughout the park. These values as embodied by the dress and comportment of the Disneyland staff were also heavily racialized. They tapped into a set of visual and verbal signifiers that could be summarized as the prototypical “all-American look.” In clothing advertisements and fashion periodicals, companies marketed what we would today call business-casual styles as the default look, characterized by fitted slacks, sport coats, and buttoned dress shirts for men and modest sundresses for women. That these advertisements featured white men and women almost exclusively served to reify the racialized boundaries expressed through these forms of dress. This well-manicured aesthetic stood in contrast to the styles and fashions of communities of color, such as the zoot suits and intentionally baggy clothing and unkempt hairstyles.  By limiting what sort of hairstyles guests and cast members could wear, and by policing the size and fit of their uniforms, Disneyland’s dress code evoked longstanding connections between specific forms of fashion and white, middle-class values while categorically excluding ill-fitting clothes and hairstyles historically associated with the fashions and aesthetics of some communities of color. In its efforts to evoke family-friendly and cohesive themes of America’s past and future alongside elements of fantasy and wonder, Disneyland’s cast member and guest appearance protocols demarcated clear boundaries between acceptable dress for men and women, boys and girls. These policies built upon broader cultural assumptions about race and gender and added to the many other elements of the Disneyland theme park that helped to generate and preserve its status as a living monument to heteronormative, white, middle-class American culture.   141  CONCLUSION  It is hard to overstate the significance that Disneyland and the broader Disney brand had and continue to have in American culture. As Leo Litwaklos put it, “In a pluralistic society where our experiences of family, school and church are uncommon, we are knit together by the Mouse and Donald Duck.”94 To his point, Disneyland during its opening decades retained a staggeringly high attendance rate, unparalleled by any other such cultural site. But the park was representative of the larger cultural brand that existed in various other forms of media, consumer goods, and products. As such, Disneyland was simultaneously representative of a host of postwar American cultural values and hugely influential in shaping said cultural values. As an entertainment center, Disneyland defined what it meant to be or not be a theme park through the twentieth century. More importantly, though, Disneyland asserted itself as a cultural constant, especially with regard to the American child and family. Litwaklos later mentioned that “For better or for ill, at least one generation of Americans has Mickey Mouse in its bones.”95 Disneyland epitomized a postwar American public longing to escape blighted urban centers into a fantasy land of nostalgia for the past and promising visions of the future. These narratives of America’s past and its possible future, as with many other themed aspects of the park, were highly gendered and racialized. They helped delimit between the masculine and the feminine in the context of the fantastical American West of Frontierland, as well as in the imagined futures of Tomorrowland. They simultaneously reaffirmed racial boundaries through narratives of violence. Cast                                                      94 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM25. 95 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM25. 142  members similarly embodied gendered and racial difference, both through their appearance and through their placements in certain themed lands and attractions. As the park rose to prominence shortly after its opening, its depictions of American society and culture became not just reflections of the moment, but highly influential in the construction and dissemination of American postwar values to the visiting public, although as mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Walt Disney and the larger Disney brand were already cultural tastemakers before the 1950s.  And this power extended to the park’s ability to inform guests about America’s history. As Litwaklos reminded readers, “It is not too strange that, given (Disney’s) enormous resources, history as he sees it becomes history as we see it.”96 In other words, the historical narratives that found expression in the park’s rides and attractions are at the forefront of public discourse on history and popular historical memory. Those historical narratives, moreover, are dangerously oversimplified and sanitized in their efforts to maintain broad appeal with the consumers and guests that enter the park’s gates. He notes that Walt’s “Lincoln has been redeemed for all America as a nonpartisan President…There is no evidence in his speech of the slavery issue or the Civil War. This is a Lincoln we can all accept without reservation.”97 Although these historical narratives are first and foremost created to entertain, they inevitably shape public memory of the president and the history he represents, and this omission works to silence certain aspects of our historical knowledge. As such, it is vital to remain critical of the ways in which                                                      96 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM25. 97 “A Fantasy That Paid Off,” pg. SM25. 143  theme parks have informed and continue to inform our understanding of things like gender, identity, and, as the next chapter explores, American history. 144  Chapter 3: Where History is Delighting: Six Flags Over Texas and National Identity  In late August of 2017, the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation removed the stars-and-bars Confederate flag from three of its theme parks, including from the first park in the chain, Six Flags Over Texas. The decision came in the wake of the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Six Flags’ decision to remove the Confederate flags reversed its previous position on the issue. Following the massacre of nine Black churchgoers by white nationalist Dylann Roof in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015, the corporation chose to keep the Confederate flags in its parks despite protests from the community.1 Responses to the removal of the Confederate flags from the three parks ranged from relief to disbelief to outright anger. The most outspoken opponent of the move was Sid Miller, Agriculture Commissioner for the state of Texas. Miller lamented that it was “‘a sad day for Texas and all of America,’” in the aftermath of the decision. As with other pro-Confederate flag and statue advocate, Miller decried what he saw as an effort to erase or change Texas’ history. He contended that “‘Texas history is rich and colorful, while at the same time complicated and troubled, but when looked at in its totality, never shameful!’” Sharon Parker of the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation released a statement to coincide with the decision, stating that, “‘At Six Flags Over                                                      1 “Six Flags has taken down its Confederate flag. But that’s not the only legacy of Jim Crow at the park,” Victoria W. Wolcott, The Washington Post, August 28, 2017, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2017/08/28/six-flags-has-taken-down-its-confederate-flag-but-thats-not-the-only-legacy-of-jim-crow-at-the-park/ 145  Texas, we strive every single day to make people happy and to create a fun, thrilling and safe family friendly experience for our guests.’”2  Still, others came to the fore to denounce the removal of the Confederate flag alongside concurrent efforts to remove Confederate statues nationwide as a widespread revision or erasure of American history. Jeff McAlister of the Longview News-Journal invoked Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “Earth’s Holocaust” as a cautionary tale about the destruction of iconography of the past.3 Bob Hankins of Pflugerville writing to the Austin American-Statesman argued that the park was succumbing to “the pressure to hide our state’s and nation’s history,” and scoffed that it should change its name to “‘One Flag Over Sissified Texas.’”4 Craig Ward of Euless, Texas, echoed Hankins’ sentiments, adding that “Six Flags executives simply surrendered to the activists.”5 Professor Neal Coates at Abilene Christian University suggested that Confederate flags and monuments “‘help us know where we’ve come as a country and this grand American experiment.’”6 This latest contest over the place of Confederate iconography in public spaces was but one of many in Texas’ history. In 1969, for instance, Black students at the University of Texas at Arlington protested the campuses Confederate theming by occupying the Robert E. Lee suite in the student center, despite the fact that one year prior, the student                                                      2 “Ag official blasts Six Flags over Confederate flag move,” Max B.

In 1965, for example, the park re-wrote its captured Union spy narrative to instead focus on a captured Confederate deserter allegedly because visitors from the North found the former distasteful.9 As early as 1971, the park began removing the Confederate battle flags from the “Confederacy” section of the park.10 Similarly, between the 1996 and 1997 seasons, the park changed the name of its “Confederacy” section to the “Old South” and removed all Confederate battle flags from the park, although the less recognizable Stars and Bars remained until 2017, as previously mentioned.11 In calling the removal part of a broader “‘scourge of race baiting, liberal activism,’” Miller’s commentary reminds us that this particular instance of public history                                                      7 “Arlington Blacks Stir New Protest,” Austin American-Statesman, Austin, Texas, March 27, 1969, pg.

But, his later comment about the “‘high-jacking [sic] and blatant theft of our state’s history from our children, grandchildren, and future generations,’” signals a deeper connection between discourses of history education, the state—and by extension the nation—and the child. As discussed in the introduction and previous chapter, “the child” has functioned as a persistent rhetorical device in debates over propriety in public consumer and leisure spaces.12 For Six Flags Over Texas then, whose theming covered centuries of Texas’ colonial history, the challenge was to render histories rooted in violence, dispossession, and slavery suitable for a broad consuming public. This chapter considers how Six Flags Over Texas navigated the tensions between idealized and authentic versions of America’s past and its impetus to provide wholesome and thrilling entertainment for the whole family.   This chapter also serves as a comparison between Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland. Although the two parks shared more than they did not, Six Flags Over Texas remained relatively regional compared to the international phenomenon that Disneyland would become within a decade of its opening. Likewise, although Disneyland drew significant crowds from the Orange County region throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, Six Flags Over Texas was arguably more intimately tied to the surrounding community than Disneyland for a number of reasons. Disneyland quickly became a worldwide destination park—a singular star attraction unlike any other in the world—while Six Flags Over Texas was envisioned as part of a larger entertainment                                                      12 “Ag official blasts Six Flags over Confederate flag move.”  148  center for the Dallas-Fort Worth region and the greater US Southwest. Mayor Vandergriff echoed this sentiment in a 1971 article celebrating the arrival of a new Major League Baseball team to the area. In the article, he states that the relocation of the Washington Senators to Arlington was “‘just another addition to a rather tremendous family entertainment complex we’ve been assembling’”.13 Contending with the differing scales of each park—worldwide versus regional—helps to contextualize their place in the national culture and, for this chapter in particular, in discourses of America’s history in public consumer spaces.     Unpacking the historical narratives and images present throughout Six Flags Over Texas’ past is important inasmuch as the park was arguably one of the most well-attended sites of public history in the state.14 In the context of the theme park, historical narratives ran the gamut between gravely serious reflections on the state and nation’s past and light, airy, and occasionally humorous historical vignettes played for laughs. The latter types of narratives are a reminder that Six Flags Over Texas remained a consumer-oriented leisure space first and foremost despite marketing materials that lauded the park’s historical authenticity. That these narratives played out in a highly commodified space does not diminish their power and importance but does necessitate a more complex and nuanced reading of these narratives and their two-fold intent: to educate and to entertain. As this chapter demonstrates, the resulting histories presented to visitors of the park foregrounded and reinforced white, heteropatriarchal and nationalistic tropes and                                                      13 “Texas Jubilates Over Its Short-horns,” pg. H5. 14 Michael Wallace makes this point about the popularity of theme parks as public history sites in “Serious Fun,” The Public Historian, Vol. 17, No. 4 (Autumn 1995), pg. 83-89. 149  narratives like the “Vanishing Indian” myth and other such instruments of “Imperialist Nostalgia.”15      As was the case with Disneyland, the histories present in Six Flags Over Texas were also partially a response to the rapid industrialization and suburbanization in the area. The previous “cattle ranches and farm country” had “given way to industrial and recreational development,” but journalists, city promoters, and other long-time Texans promised that the region was still bursting with “the same pioneering and progressive spirit that sparked Texas’ early growth.”16 The histories generated by this tension were well-worn narratives of a romanticized colonial past, but in the postwar moment, they took on new meaning as park managers and attendees alike encountered an increasingly diverse set of perspectives in the world around them. Much like the suburbs of Anaheim and Arlington, theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas became a voyeuristic landscape where visitors—mostly white and middle class—could interact with “authentic” representations of other cultures. As this chapter will show, these representations, particularly of Mexicans and Native Americans, worked to cordon off these groups into a static and vanishing historical past at a time when they and other groups began writing back against these reductive forms of public and popular history. So, for example, although the myth of the “Vanishing Indian” had its roots in nineteenth-century American intellectual circles, aspects of it gained new salience in the context of post-1950s Native                                                      15 For more about the “Vanishing Indian” myth in the 1950s, see, “Civilization Is Poison to the Indian: Missionization, Authenticity, and the Myth of the Vanishing Indian,” book chapter in Coming Full Circle: Spirituality and Wellness among Native Communities in the Pacific Northwest, O’Brien, 2013, pg. 71-99. “Imperialist Nostalgia,” Rosaldo.  16 “Fun and Industry Flourish Side-By-Side,” Six Flags Gazette, Summer, 1967, pg. 23. 150  American responses to policies and practices which drastically reduced the size of reservations across the nation and pushed indigenous groups toward urban spaces.17 The same can be said of Mexicans living in the United States, who during the mid and late-1960s began to form the Chicano movement in Texas and other states in part to reclaim their history from the grips of Anglo storytellers.  This chapter examines how Six Flags Over Texas balanced postwar optimism with the concurrent yearning for historic preservation and contributed to discourses of gender, the child, the family, and state and national identity. This chapter also considers the ways in which some of the parks’ themes, like death, violence, and sexual innuendo, managed to coexist alongside the parks’ more wholesome elements. Throughout the 1960s, the park sought to maintain its image as a space for family-friendly leisure, entertainment and education through historically themed rides and attractions. Unlike Disneyland, however, the park struggled with its identity from the 1970s onward. Park officials alienated Wynne, Jr., in 1970, who, like Disney, served as the foundation of the park’s brand during the first decade, and it encountered a host of economic problems intermittently during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Consequently, the park experimented with new strategies of theming and marketing throughout the later decades of the twentieth century, largely focusing on promoting the park’s impressive ride collection and a broad theme of thrill. This chapter traces the changing themes and attractions at Six                                                      17 For a summary of 1950s policies, see, “Roots of the Native American Urban Experience: Relocation Policy in the 1950s,” Larry W.

Before starting the Great Southwest Corporation to fund Six Flags Over Texas, park progenitor, Angus G. Wynne, Jr., was a well-known investor and real estate magnate in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. He helped found Wynnewood in 1947, a neighborhood in the Oak Cliff area of Dallas built with suburban sensibilities that included its own shopping complex. He began developing the Great Southwest Industrial District in 1955 after forming the Great Southwest Corporation to finance the venture. The industrial park sat between Dallas and Ft. Worth and was set to feature another shopping complex as well as a sports and recreation arena. The story goes that after a family vacation to Disneyland in 1958, Wynne, Jr. envisioned bringing the theme park to Texas which would become the centerpiece of his industrial district between the two major cities.18 For Wynne, Jr., then, building a theme park appeared to be just another venture in a long line of real estate development projects and regional boosterism. Walt Disney and the Disney brand, on the other hand, were already trusted names in family-friendly children’s entertainment and consumer products nationwide by the time Disneyland opened in 1955. Dallas Morning News—the largest newspaper for the Dallas-Ft. Worth area in the mid-twentieth century—featured countless advertisements targeting Texas families for Disney products throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Whether it was family nights with Disney movies like Cinderella (1950) and Treasure Island (1950)                                                      18 Evelyn Barker, “Wynne, Angus Gilchrist, Jr.,” Handbook of Texas Online, accessed January 02, 2021, https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/wynne-angus-gilchrist-jr. 152  at the South Loop drive-in theater or Titche’s stain-proof playing cards for kids with images of Mickey Mouse and friends, Dallas-area readers were familiar with the Disney name well before either theme park opened.19 After Disneyland opened, regional media outlets pumped out article after article singing the praises of “Walt Disney’s Magic Kingdom” to their readers in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. One article promised that “the happiest place on earth” was also “one of the cleanest and best-organized places on earth,” and that children in particular “would love Disneyland—but so will the adults in the family.”20 Businesses in the area raffled away all-expenses trips to Disneyland for Dallas-Ft. Worth families, and the Disneyland television show, which among other things advertised the new rides and attractions at the Disneyland theme park, was a mainstay of the 6:30-7:30 PM block on the area’s ABC station, channel eight.21  It was not foreordained that Wynne, Jr.’s park would become the epicenter of family fun in Texas, nor that the park would target families with children as its primary demographic. Although Wynne, Jr. and later his Great Southwest Corporation constructed a handful of neighborhoods designed around single-family units, it is fair to say that neither he nor his subsidiaries had reached a place in the zeitgeist vis-à-vis the child comparable to Disney, even at the local level. Throughout the late-1950s and early-1960s, Wynne, Jr. enjoyed regular mentions in the Dallas Morning News “Social Circuit”                                                      19 See examples of ads for Disney products in Dallas Morning News, April 8th, 1950, pg. 4; June 16th, 1950, pg. 38; July, 2nd, 1950, pg. 76. 20 “Disneyland’s Low-Budget Fare Gives Enjoyment to All in Family,” Dallas Morning News, August 24th, 1954, pg. 72.  21 See ad for Wyatt Food Stores’ Disneyland vacation giveaway, Dallas Morning News, February 2nd, 1959, pg. 80; ad for Hudson car dealership Disneyland giveaway, Dallas Morning News, June 29th, 1955, pg.12; and one of the endless TV guide listings, Dallas Morning News, October 30th, 1957, pg. 10.  153  column, with articles naming him among “Dallas’ leading citizens, the Headliners.”22  During this time, he also served on a number of civic and community organizations in various capacities. In 1955 alone, Wynne, Jr. served as the chairman of the Dallas area Ground Observer Corps and as the head of the Chamber of Commerce’s aviation committee.23 Thanks to his community engagement, Wynne, Jr. did have a degree of name recognition in Dallas, but he was better known for designing business-minded industrial parks and not family-friendly amusement parks. But, once news broke of the forthcoming theme park, newspaper articles and media outlets began drawing comparisons between Wynne Jr.’s new project and the happiest place on Earth. Even in the early stages of planning, writers and news anchors heralded the arrival of a Texas-type Disneyland in the area. One article from the Dallas Morning News in December of 1958 reported that the Great Southwest Corporation had begun site preparation for “’Great Southwestland,’ a 102-acre $10,000,000 Disneyland-like park.”24 Another article from the Dallas Morning News in February of 1960 announced that construction “on a Disneyland-type amusement center planned for the Great Southwest Industrial District” would begin in early-1961. The article continues to state that then-Vice President of the Great Southwest Company, C. W. Goyer, told                                                      22 “Social Circuit: With Bow to High Finance, Headliners and High Jinx,” Dallas Morning News, May 5th, 1961, pg. 29. 23 “Love Field’s Anchor Man,” Dallas Morning News, May 1st, 1955, pg. 43; “Home Emergency Corps Sets Progress Report Meeting,” Dallas Morning News, August 6th, 1955, pg. 14. 24 “At Grand Prairie,” Dallas Morning News, December 15th, 1958, pg. 33. 154  reporters that “Texas Under Six Flags”—the first draft for the park’s name—would “be modeled after California’s Disneyland,” but with a Texas theme.25  Journalistic comparisons between the Texas theme park and Disneyland would persist throughout the park’s early years, such as when Edward J. Wojtas of the Chicago Tribune stated, “California may have Disneyland but down in Texas its [sic] Six Flags Over Texas that draws the crowds.”26 In these comparisons, Disneyland overwhelmingly served as the prototypical “theme amusement park,” and with good reason, but Six Flags Over Texas was gaining attention outside the Southwest region, so much so that one author claimed that it could “show even Disneyland a few new tricks.”27 Whether these comparisons between Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were deliberate or unavoidable, though, is relatively inconsequential. It seemed as though in the wake of Disneyland’s watershed opening in 1955, theme parks were ingrained in post-war American culture as quintessential tourist destinations for families. The challenge, then, was for parks like Six Flags Over Texas to wrestle tourists’ attention—and consequently tourists’ dollars—away from Disneyland. Parks like Six Flags Over Texas had to forge their own unique identity or come up with a catchy schtick that would not alienate or turn off families broadly conceived.                                                       25 “GCS ‘Disneyland’ Start Due in ’61,” Dallas Morning News, February 2nd, 1960, pg. 10; One of the park’s original names, “Texas Under Six Flags,” was used in countless settings throughout Texas’s history as a broad theme for various events. One early example is from 1899, where the Central Christian Church themed an event “Texas Under Six Flags,” from The Dallas Morning News, April 4th, 1899, pg. 8.  26 “Six Flags Over Texas Combines History and Fun: Lone Star State’s Park Big Success,” Chicago Tribune, March 28th, 1965, pg. F8.  27 “Six Flags Recieves [sic] Plaudits,” pg. 3. 155  Like Disneyland, advertisements for Six Flags Over Texas throughout the 1960s would continue to foreground the family as its prototypical guest. They urged readers to “have a day of family fun,” or promised them that the park’s “rides, attractions and featured shows provide a wonderful way to spend a family day.”28 Through the park’s gates, guests would find “a whole world of family entertainment, adventure and beauty,” and “a day of family entertainment you’ll long remember.”29 Angus Wynne, Jr. himself declared in a 1964 letter to the readers of the Six Flags Gazette that “‘Family fun’ is our motto.”30 For the late-1960s, the park ran a series of advertisements featuring that catchphrase, “accent on,” such as “accent on action,” “accent on entertainment,” and “accent on family entertainment.” The park even occasionally borrowed some of the catchphrases made popular by Disneyland. One advertisement from 1965 claimed at the park, “the young and young-at-heart” were “caught up in our magic wonderland.”31 Unlike Disneyland, though, which was themed and organized around more abstract notions of the past, present, and future of America, Six Flags Over Texas styled its rides, shows, and attractions with an eye toward Texas’s history. In particular, park designers drew inspiration from specific moments of Texas history, as well as more broadly from the histories of the constituent nations represented by the six flags. Newspapers and promotional material during the early years of the park’s operation                                                      28 See advertisements in Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, June 4, 1963, pg. 3—4, September 28, 1963, pg. 4—5. 29 See advertisements in Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, July 22, 1968, pg. 7B, October 18, 1964, pg. 4—8. 30 Letter from Angus Wynne, Jr., Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News Texan, Irving, Texas, Spring 1964, pg. 8. 31 See advertisements in Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, May 24, 1965, pg. 16A, May 29, 1965, pg. 17A, April 23, 1967, pg. 4D. 156  remarked at how it integrated Texas history into its theming. A script from a December 31st, 1961 broadcast of WBAP-TV in Fort Worth marveled at the park’s many “colorful, fun-filled avenues of Texas history.”32 An advertisement during its 1965 season promised that guests would “discover a colorful panorama of Texas’ past” around every corner.”33 Marj Abrams of the Chicago Tribune commented in 1969 that, “Instead of just writing history books about their six flags,” the operators “built a whole blooming amusement park to commemorate this history.”34 It is clear from these examples alone that Six Flags Over Texas imagined and marketed itself as a site for family fun and Texas history. As such, its important here to unpack the ways in which Six Flags Over Texas exhibited specific historical narratives, as well as the broader ways in which nation-state histories rely on and reinforce white heteropatriarchal scripts. The park opened in 1961 with six themed areas dedicated to the histories and images of the six governing bodies that ruled over Texas throughout its history. One article from the summer edition of the 1967 Six Flags Gazette best summarizes the histories that informed the themes and motifs of each section of the park. “A Capsule History of Texas” gives a brief description of each flag represented in the Six Flags park, and it explains how that history comes to life through the various themes and attractions. In the Spanish section, the article explains, “two great figures stand out above all others:”                                                      32 WBAP-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

H6.  157  the Conquistador, “mighty soldier of the king, a conqueror in shining armor and plumed helmet,” and the missionary, “the robed man of God…intent on saving the souls of the Red man.” The French section of the park was themed after the exploits of “French nobleman-adventurer, Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle,” who landed in Texas alongside shiploads of “soldiers, priests, and 200 men, women and children as colonists.” Although the colony floundered, the article argues that the French “imprint is still strong in the land of Tejas.”  In the Texas section, the park honored the “wild and woolly” Old West with its shootouts, horse thieves “and swift justice.” The Mexico section of the park honors “a ways of life blended from that of two ancient peoples—the proud Aztecs, noblest of the Indians that populated a continent, and the adventurous, fun-loving sons and daughters of Old Spain who brought a Latin spirit the New World.” The park likewise celebrates the “four unforgettable years” of the Confederacy, depicting “the dreamy, relaxed life of the South just before the Civil War;” “the Southern joys and thrills;” and the “true Southern ways, dialects and habits” that are apart of Texas history and heritage. The USA section of the park was meant to honor and portray Texas and the US as “the vanguard of human freedom and progress,” with Texas taking “its place among the leading states in industry, space, education, commerce, trade and banking.”35  In each other six themed sections, guests could immerse themselves in historical eras through interactive rides, attractions, and character actors. In the Spanish section of the park, for example, guests could interact with a character actor playing the part of a                                                      35 “A Capsule History of Texas,” Six Flags Gazette, Summer 1967, pg. 20. 158  missionary at the replica San Francisco de Los Tejas Mission. Here, they would learn about “the robed men who dedicated their lives to the conversion of the friendly Tejas Indians,” and how they brought “the Cross and the Word” in their “works of mercy.” Guests would also encounter the attacks by hostile tribes like “the fierce Apaches and Comanches.”36 The Spanish section of the park also featured an attraction where guests would ride pack mules alongside Francisco Vasquez de Coronado, “greatest of the conquistadores,” as they searched for the Seven Cities of Cibola.”37 Inspired by the historical tales of the Conquistador, the ride was part of “the burning wastelands of the Spanish section” included “the whipping post,” which one article mentions “adds a cruel but realistic note to your impression of the era.”38  This section of the park was relatively threadbare in terms of theming and attractions, but what little it had reinforced some of the broader themes and motifs found throughout the park. This section, in particular, celebrated an age of exploration, acts of religious conquest, and colonial wars with its daring conquistadors and Spanish missions. The references to scorched landscapes and the underlying threat of violence throughout the “Conquistador Burro Ride” speak to how this section of the park and others turned histories of bloodshed into spectacles for the whole family to enjoy. Moreover, these attractions illustrate how guests were meant to identify with the colonial powers in many of the park’s themed rides and shows. Families joined the “Conquistador Burro Ride” as                                                      36 “Gold Is Lure In Trek Over Spanish Trail,” pg. 6. 37 “The Wynne Who Waves Six Flags,” pg. 9. 38 “Gold Is Lure In Trek Over Spanish Trail,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, November 1961, pg. 6. 159  fellow colonizers searching for lost treasures in exotic lands.39 Lastly, the overall theming of the Spanish section was meant to evoke a decided “pastness”: that is, to convince visitors that the cultures and histories represented in the themed area were of the past.40 Worth noting, though, is that the “Conquistador Burro Ride” lasted only two seasons and was summarily replaced by the “El Aserradero (Saw Mill).” Park managers stated that the ride had too low capacity, and as it was the only ride in the Spanish section of the park, many guests were avoiding the land altogether. One oft repeated goal of the park in its advertisements and other published materials was to present an entertaining but simultaneously authentic version of Texas’ history. The Texas State Historical Survey Committee recognized the park “as being educationally and historically authentic, along with its entertainment,” and constructed seven historical markers in various areas of the park.41 This aspiration for historical authenticity was largely marketing rhetoric meant to distinguish Six Flags Over Texas from Disneyland which relied on more abstract notions of the past. Six Flags Over Texas would regularly take inspiration from Texas history, but oftentimes the version of history depicted in the park had to be sanitized to fit with the park’s efforts to maintain a family-friendly atmosphere. Coverage of the park’s opening plans noted how “of course there will be the old saloon where many a man drank, the fought it out with six-shooters.”42                                                      39 Jeanne van Eeden discusses the prototypical “Lost City” as a theme in “Theming Mythical Africa at the Lost City,” The Themed Space: Locating Culture, Nation, and Self, pg.113-35. 40 Cornelius Holtorf discusses pastness as a thematic device in “Pastness in Themed Environments,” A Reader in Themed and Immersive Spaces, pg. 31-37. 41 “Six Flags Recieves [sic] Plaudits,” pg. 4-5 42 WBAP-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.). [News Script: Six Flags], item, April 4, 160  Despite this comment, however, alcohol was not allowed in the park, much like in Disneyland. Although historical authenticity was a marketing cornerstone for Six Flags Over Texas, it was clear that the park was selective about what aspects of said past were appropriate for children and their families to see and consume. In some cases, the park’s use of historical events and narratives in its theming allowed for attractions, rides, and shows to explore and display some of the less family-friendly aspects of the past. La Salle’s River Adventure, for example, exhibited scenes of war and death at various points throughout the ride’s duration. The ride mirrored Robert La Salle’s expeditions in the late-1600s, taking guests up the Lavaca River, around Fort St. Louis and through a number of French, Spanish, and Native American camps along the way. Guests encountered wildlife and other natural impediments during their journey, but the main drama that transpired was the conflict between nations. In one archival video of the ride from the 1960s, the tour guide explains to guests that they are on an expedition “for the glory of France” during which they come upon a Spanish Fort. He warns guests that they are at war just before the fort’s cannons fire upon the boat. After clearing the fort, the expedition finds two fellow French explorers, Jacque and Pierre, hanging from a nearby tree, to which the tour guide states “We’re in trouble now. That means there’s Indians ahead.” Riders eventually encounter the Indian village, where the tour guide points out then “medicine men” and “Indian braves” who have “sworn a blood                                                      1961; (https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc975749/m1/1/?q=six%20flags: accessed February 28, 2022), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, https://texashistory.unt.edu; crediting UNT Libraries Special Collections. 161  oath kill any white man” they see.43 The boat careens around alligators, cougars, and beavers before passing through a mock Indian burial ground and to the boarding station. Guests on the La Salle River Adventure encountered countless threats of violence and mutilation during their expedition, which seems to fly in the face of the family-friendly atmosphere promoted by theme parks of the 1950s and 60s. Disneyland’s own riverboat attraction included scenes of animatronic lions feasting on zebras, but human death was not featured on its boat ride. What this signaled was that Six Flags Over Texas was occasionally able to utilize its stated commitment to historical authenticity to toe the line on what was considered acceptable content for children. Violence and death were central to the histories depicted in the park; therefore the park arguably could get away with breaching the wholesome and family-friendly environment that came to characterize the theme park of the postwar moment. It also demonstrated that, as early as its opening years, Six Flags Over Texas was distinctly edgier than its counterpart in Anaheim. While Disneyland expressed apprehension at representations of violence outside of its own historical US West-themed area, Frontierland, Six Flags Over Texas made violence and colonial histories essential to its themed landscape.    Six Flags Over Texas also included a number of impromptu performances throughout the park that featured brazen displays of violence. In one recurring pop-up show in the Confederacy section of the park, actors dressed as Confederate soldiers                                                      43 Archival footage, “La Salle’s River Adventure at Six Flags Over Texas – Date Unknown,” from the G. William Jones Film and Video Archive at SMU, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fb-a7bllrI. The live alligators shown in the video were removed shortly after the ride opened, which suggests that the video was taken within months of the park’s 1961 opening day. 162  would out and summarily execute another actor playing the role of Union spy in the middle of a park walkway. The encounters began innocently enough, with the spy singing songs for the audience and the soldier actors at Mrs. Goff’s Frozen Sweets Shop, but all encounters inevitably ended when the spy was “found out and shot to death by rebel forces.”44 In the park’s Texas section, character actors playing the town desperadoes would rob a bank and get into shoot-outs with the sheriff. Sam Bass and his outlaw allies would accost guests and operators of the park’s narrow-gauge train, the “General Sam Houston,” but reports promised that no guests were actually harmed or robbed in the park’s pop-up performance. Disneyland’s equivalent of the sheriff and bandit storyline took place in Frontierland, where character actors would intermittently get into scuffles outside the Golden Horseshoe Dancehall. These fights would often end with the sheriff shooting at the feet of troublemaker, who would dance around the bullets to the amusement of onlookers. The act served as an advertisement for the Golden Horseshoe Revue show inside the saloon, as well. Some of Disneyland’s attractions included instances of violence, most notably on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, but death was rarely, if ever, a facet of Disneyland narratives. Whether it was character actors tumbling overboard and out of sight after a gunshot, or animatronics mechanically resetting to their starting position after encountering water torture and cannon fire, Disneyland rides and attractions eschewed exposing guests to death. Six Flags Over Texas, on the other hand, made mortality a highly visible part of a handful of ride narratives and shows.                                                      44 “Singing Spy,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 1961, pg. 2. 163  Six Flags Over Texas promised visitors an insightful, authentic, and entertaining rendition of Texas’ past filled with the thrills and dangers of the ages of exploration and conquest. It was a landscape rife with an “Imperialist Nostalgia” where visitors and park planners alike encountered and expressed a shared yearning for an idealized past replete with cultures and peoples of a bygone era.45 Costumed characters and decaying facades evoked a pastness in its themed areas. It was a type of interactive and immersive public history exhibit which, much like museums and other public history sites of the midcentury, ironically shored up differences and distance between the visitors and the objects and cultures on display even as it encouraged guests to have literal dialogues with character actors and cultural representatives.46 Although it assured guests historical authenticity, it, like any site of public history, actively foregrounded some aspects of its colonial histories and silenced others.47   Nowhere was this intersection of nostalgia and historical erasure so prominent as in the Confederate section of the park. As guests encountered the “two white pillars forming the majestic entrance” into the section, they would allegedly experience “a thrill of urgency” as they visualized “Texas rallying to the side of the Confederacy.” Marketing material described themes of the area as evocative of “Texas when it was a land of cotton with aristocratic drivers in sparkling surreys with their crinoline-clad southern belles.” The section was meant to pay tribute to “the heroic struggle of a century ago that tested                                                      45 Rosaldo, “Imperialist Nostalgia.” 46 Filippo Carlà discusses this ironic closeness/distance dichotomy of interactive themed sites in “The Uses of History in Themed Spaces,” A Reader in Themed and Immersive Spaces, pg. 19. 47 For a seminal work in silence and historical narrative production, see Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History, Michel-Rolph Trouillot, 1995.  164  the mettle and souls of the legions of the badly outnumbered gray. To immerse guests in Civil War-era Texas, the section included “Quaint little shops” like “the ice cream parlor and the serene book store where the sewing circles met to discuss troubled times.” The amphitheater hosted “Many top vaudeville acts” and “Banjo strumming minstrels” for every guest to enjoy. Guests could ride the “Butterfield Stage Coach” attraction which was “infested by Indians and outlaws” without fear because “the man riding shotgun is an expert shot.”48 The most glaring omission from Six Flags Over Texas’s depiction of Texas during the Confederacy also happens to be the defining characteristic of that historical, and indeed of world history writ large—slavery. The park has been historically silent on the absence of depictions or discussions of slavery in the Confederate section, but it is not hard to imagine why the absence persists.49 One could make a rather convincing argument that depictions of slavery do not belong anywhere outside of a strictly educational context.50 But the park, which claims to celebrate all eras of Texas history, does not mention slavery at all. Although the purpose of the park is first and foremost to entertain, to do so using historical narratives and representations of the Civil War-era without mentioning slavery is to expunge the issue altogether from the park’s contribution to public historical memory. If young boys can sign up to fight for the                                                      48 “White Pillars Announce Texas, a ‘Rebel State,’” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, October 1961, pg. 7. 49 One article from the inaugural issue of the Six Flags Gazette mentions Texas’s history of slavery, but that seems to be the extent of its coverage from the park, “Texas ‘Cotton Clads’ Aided Confederacy,” Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News, Irving, Texas, August 1961, pg. 4.  50 For an accessible exploration of the complexities of slavery in public history, see How the Word is Passed, Clint Smith, 2021.  165  Confederacy, it seems pertinent to at least broach the subject of what they are hypothetically fighting for.  The park’s silence around the issue of slavery is doubly egregious when discussed alongside its depictions of or play around violence and death, particularly of Native American character actors. Despite the fact that in most cases, slain character actors would stand back up and bow to the crowd after a pause for dramatic effect to “show that it’s really all in fun,” the performance of the act alone reinforces that certain kinds of death and dying were part and parcel of these historical eras and that these aspects of history are suitable for kids.51 As a site of public history, Six Flags Over Texas ferried guests through a history characterized by violence, colonization, and exploitation, but it filtered these histories through attractions and locations that foregrounded pleasure and amusement. Doing so distanced guests from the implications of their roleplaying as the colonizers in these frontier histories. It also displaced “these societies’ coming collapse” and the consequences of colonialism out of site or “at the margins,” creating “not moral indignation, but an elegiac mode of perception” at best.52 The “Six Flags Gazette” was the name of the Six Flags Over Texas weekly newsletter, but it was also the name of an interactive attraction on photo and print history in the state. The attraction, sponsored by the Daily News Texan, featured pictorial histories of printing presses throughout the years and a smattering of recreated news headlines from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Times Herald that acted as a                                                      51 “Rally Round The Flag—Confederate, That Is: Rebel Section Just One of Six Reflecting Our State’s History,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, October 1961, pg. 1. 52 “Imperialist Nostalgia,” pg. 107. 166  timeline of world events. Guests could also ask about current events, as the location had a WWI-era teletypewriter in residence that received the latest news from United Press International during the morning. The attraction also featured a mini-photo exhibit that compared the past and present of Arlington, contrasting “street scenes of muddy ruts and flowing super highways.” Most guests, however, went to the “Six Flags Gazette” to “take the past home with them” with one of the attraction’s many souvenirs. Here, they could create wanted posters; custom newspaper headlines; or they could take vintage tintype photographs.53  The “Six Flags Gazette” attraction highlighted one constant that lay under most guest interactions with Texas history in the park. Here, as in other sections of the park, guests were not only engaging with the past by observing artifacts and recreations or by talking to knowledgeable hosts and hostesses about history. They were simultaneously compelled to spend money to record their “visit to Six Flags at the Gazette.”54 As a companion article declared, “the whole family can go home with blaring headlines across the paper telling about their visit to Six Flags.” The most popular feature of the “Six Flags Gazette” was the tintype photographs, where guests could wear period-specific costumes and reenact Civil War-era set-pieces and family portraits for seventy-fives cents a picture.55 These consumer products constituted a large and reliable source of revenue for the park alongside ticket sales and food and drink purchases and were a natural facet                                                      53 “Like Grandpa Used to Make,” Robert C. Stewart, Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texas, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1962, pg. 7. 54 Header in Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1962, pg. 8. 55 “Breath of Old and New,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1962, pg. 9. 167  of amusement and theme parks. But, like in Disneyland, Six Flags Over Texas park managers made a concerted effort to mask the demand to spend with rhetoric and marketing material that tied the act of consumption to participation in Texas history. One ad for the souvenir shop in the Texas section assured that the “store’s merchandise is a stock that is demanded by 1962 western-minded guests.”56    Six Flags Over Texas made similar aims to incorporate visions of a distinctly American future within their landscape dedicated to Texas history. One advertisement from 1965 explained that the park was a “magic wonderland where Texas’ dramatic past touches hand with the exciting future.”57 Ironically, some of the park’s efforts to immerse guests in an imagined future relied on the very same rhetoric, and sometimes even the same attractions, as Disneyland. The park opened with the “Happy Motoring Freeway” attraction, which, like Disneyland’s “Autopia,” allowed kids “to drive the car of tomorrow on a kiddie-size turnpike.”58 The park’s “Sidewinder” and “Missilechaser” attractions in the “Modern USA” section worked as thematic bridges between the present and the future, despite the fact that the rides themselves had very little in the way of theming. As their names imply, these attractions were loosely themed around modern military technologies. The ride vehicles themselves were meant to preview “dynamic                                                      56 “Texas Occupies Largest Sector,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, April 1962, pg. 6. 57 “six flags…accent on entertainment,” advertisement, Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, May 19, 1965, pg. 17A. 58 WBAP-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

It experienced a similar challenge throughout the 1960s in particular of incorporating references to outside brands into its established themed sections dedicated to Texas history. Aside from corporate sponsorships of rides and attractions, Six Flags Over Texas featured a leasing system throughout its opening years, where businesses could lease out buildings in the park to sell their products. Camark Pottery out of Arkansas leased a building adjoining the popular “Crazy Horse Saloon” to sell pottery and other wares for the 1961 season. They also happened to be a warehouse client for the nearby Great Southwest Industrial District. Leonards Department Store leased a space next to “Miss Abigail’s Gift Shop,” and for the first year of operation, guests could also visit “Naler’s Chicken Plantation,” the “Indian Village,” “El Chico Mexican Restaurant,” and “Mrs. Goff’s Ice Cream Shop,” which were all stocked and partially operated under the park’s leasing system.62 These and other collaborations with                                                      59 “Modern Texas Displayed In USA Section,” Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News, Irving, Texas, August 1961, pg. 21. 60 Davis McCown, Six Flags Over Texas: The First Fifty Years, 2016, pg. 26. 61 “Modern Texas Displayed In USA Section.” 62 McCown, pg. 24, 46-47. 169  local and national businesses within the park were a reminder that although the park was a fantastical landscape of spectacles of the past and future, it was also undeniably and visibly a product of the postwar present. In its opening years, Six Flags Over Texas had no shortage of heterosexual courtship and play weaved into the theming and storytelling elements around the park. In the press preview for the park opening, for example, writers at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram lauded the beauty and authenticity of the Mexico section of the park. One feature of the park section, they state, was its impromptu performances, wherein “Beautiful senoritas [sic] stroll the streets…followed by guitar-strumming admirers who burst into song from time to time, and occasionally stop crowds with their dancing.”63 On the “Ferrocarril Fiesta Train” attraction, guests would board trains that would meander around the section of the park through various scenes of caricatures of Mexican culture and history. The “Gardens of Xochimilcho” scene featured an animatronic couple on a small boat, with the boy serenading the girl.64 The ghost town scene of the stagecoach ride added in 1964 similarly included a quick vignette of heterosexual relations between two skeletons. One skeleton “sporting a Stetson” drank away his troubles and the saloon accompanied by another skeleton, “distinguishable as a lady only by her earrings and bracelet.”65 In each of these examples, robots were made to perform acts of heterosexual courtship and romance endlessly for                                                      63 “Six Flags’ Mexico Beautiful Adventure,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 4, 1961, pg. 2. 64 McCown, pg. 56. 65 “Movie Refugee ‘Having Fun’ Creating 6 Flags Attractions,” Shannon Geddie, Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News Texan, Irving, Texas, Spring 1954, pg. 4. 170  the thousands of guests that streamed through the park gates. These courtship rituals simultaneously reinforced relatively normative gendered scripts. Whether it was the drunkard man and his nagging skeletal partner or guitar strumming performers charming aloof women, these scenarios played up gendered stereotypes. Given that the above scenarios occurred in the park’s Mexican themed section, they also relied on racialized gendered scripts. They depicted Mexican men as either suave romantics or insatiable drunks and Mexican women as tantalizing seductresses or emasculating nags.66 Other sections of the park likewise incorporated normative gendered scripts and expectations into their immersive landscapes and themed rides. In the park’s Confederate section, for example, former park employee Sam Nesmith mentions that “boys could sign up to be part of the Confederate army and girls could volunteer to be nurses.”67 While it could be argued that this practice was in the service of historical accuracy, it still reinforced gendered divisions of labor for young visitors participating in the immersive landscape of America’s past. One article in the Six Flags Gazette from its opening season depicted a group of young girls enjoying the treehouse attraction near Skull Rock. The writer states that the “group of little girls drop their feminine charm long enough to take a seemingly perilous climb to the top” of the tree house.68 This article underscores how                                                      66 For more on Mexican stereotypes in American popular culture, see Charles Ramírez Berg’s Latino Images in Film: Stereotypes, Subversion, Resistance, or Leon Rappoprt’s Punchlines: The Case for Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Humor. 67 “Six Flags Over Texas started distancing from the Confederate battle flag decades ago.” 68 “Perilous Climb,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, October 1961, pg. 7. 171  even play and leisure were gendered activities in the context of the theme park for children, in particular. Occasionally gendered differences were emblazoned on the very facades of buildings throughout the park. The Republic of Texas section of the park included “Texas Street,” which was the Six Flags Over Texas equivalent of Mainstreet USA with its historic shops and vintage charm. The street included “Fancies for Women and Girls and Substantials for Men and Boys Shop” among its attractions.69 Even the park’s most fantastic and imaginative attractions depicted fairly standard gendered scripts and performances in their scenes and themes. The “Speelunkers’ (Spee-Lunkers’) Cave” ride opened in June of the park’s 1964 season in the Confederate section. The “Speelunkers” were allegedly a group of aliens that had crash landed on Earth, or a subterranean species of anthropomorphic creatures who mimicked mundane human activities. During the ride, guests would travel through the waterways of man-made caverns on oval tubs, encountering “Speelunkers” as they worked and played. Regardless of their origin or purpose, “Speelunkers” had gendered features and characteristics that were legible to park guests of the time. Some “Speelunkers” had long, prominent eyelashes, eyelids, long hair, lipstick, and other kinds of make-up, while others were bare-faced and wide-eyed with understated haircuts if they had hair at all.70                                                      69 “You Walk Into Wild Times When You Enter Republic of Texas,” Six Flags Gazette-Irving Daily News, Irving, Texas, August 1961, pg. 14. 70 “Speelunker Cave,” Davis McCown, Parktimes.com: The Unofficial History of Six Flags Over Texas, http://parktimes.com/ptsarticles/welcome/sections/oldsouth/speelunker-cave/. 172  The gendered performances of the extraterrestrials of “Speelunkers’ Cave,” on the one hand, can be read as a meta-commentary on gendered scripts throughout America’s history and into the contemporary moment. If they were indeed intended to be aliens attempting to blend in, then their dramatic visual gendered signifiers may have been a deliberate performance and comment on some of the sillier aspects of America’s past and post-war culture. The tone of the ride itself was said to include both moments of unsettling terror and moments of half-witted absurdity. These tonal shifts left room for many kinds of interpretations of the gendered behaviors and performances of the triangle-faced animatronics.  Six Flags Over Texas appears to have hosted occasional “Date Night” type events up through the 1990s, as well. On October twentieth of 1962, for example, the park hosted a “Boy and Girl Explorer Scout Date night.”71 Earlier that year, Six Flags promoted date nights on Fridays, where couples could “dance to the music of the VibraTones” in the park’s USA section from 8-11 PM.72 In the early-1970s, KFJZ sponsored date nights on occasion, where guests could get two tickets for the price of one.73 Like Disneyland, these date night events would occasionally feature bonus musical guests, such as in 1972 when “Gladstone” performed for the love-weary teens and young adults.74 B. W. Stevenson and Canadian country-pop artist Anne Murray performed                                                      71 “Special Events At Six Flags,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, October 1962, pg. 8. 72 Advertisement, “friday night is date night at Six Flags,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, June 29, 1962, pg. 6 73 Advertisement, “KFJZ Introduces 2-for-1 date Night at Six Flags Over Texas,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, April 20, 1972, pg. 17-A. 74 Advertisement, “Six Flags Over Texas Brings Back 2-for-1 Date Night,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, May 3, 1972, pg. 19-A. 173  shows for the crowd at the park’s date nights in July and August of 1973.75 By and large, advertisements for date night events are ambiguous on whether the tickets were restricted to boy-girl or man-woman pairs. One article from 1973 states that, “Six Flags will feature a ‘Date Night’ special with two persons being admitted with each ticket purchased at the front gate after 6 p. m.”76 Even as late as 1998, these “date night” may have been open to non-romantic partners of any gender, as coverage and advertisements continued to use the ambiguous “two persons” designation.77 The more likely case is that the ambiguous language allowed for teen friends to get into the gate at date nights together regardless of gender, but it is worth musing over the possibilities of same-gender partners given that Six Flags Over Texas did not have written policies against fraternizing akin to Disneyland’s dancefloor policies before the opening of Videopolis. As with earlier examples of jokes targeting transgressive gendered performances in chapter two, theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas used humor to assign value to certain gendered behaviors. Oftentimes, though, the humor of the scenes simultaneously relied on racist caricatures rather than any sort of clever slapstick. On the “Ferrocarril” train attraction in the Mexican section of the park, for example, guests would encounter “fat little Mexican figures on burros” that were meant to “give the comical impression that they are so overloaded they will soon fall down.” Guests would also come upon “a little adobe house with its owners outside drinking Tequila.” The ride                                                      75 “Coming Attractions,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, July 20, 1973, pg. 11-B, “Date-Night set for Six Flags,” Grand Prairie Daily News, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 9, 1973, pg. 2. 76 “Date-Night Set for Six Flags,” Grand Prairie Daily News. 77 “Ticket to Ride: Area fun parks look forward to record-breaking year,” Barbara Powell, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, May 9, 1998, pg. 3. 174  also featured little animatronic dancing tamales. The Mexican section of the park, with its “picturesque streets containing quaint marketplaces and intriguing bazaars,” and its restaurant with “authentic Mexican cooking and unique design” simultaneously featured attractions wherein animatronic caricatures were the butt of every joke. The park also argued that the massive sombreros that topped “Six Flags’ Fiesta Train” gave “authenticity to” the attraction and the section overall.78 These caricatures and limiting depictions of Mexican peoples and cultures were part and parcel of many popular culture representations during the midcentury, but they also had more direct connections to similar themed landscapes like Olvera Street in Southern California. Olvera Street is “A Mexican Street of Yesterday in a City of Today” which featured vendors selling folk art and handcrafted goods, restaurants and cafes, a “traditional Mexican style plaza area,” and wandering mariachi music performers and dancers.79 Christine Sterling, who financed and planned the conversion of the few street blocks into the themed Olvera Street attraction, claimed that, “Out of the hearts of the Mexican people is spun the gold of romance and contentment.”80 The resulting Olvera Street project was partly a restoration of some of the decaying building and dilapidated infrastructure, but its true intent was to recreate an idealized past version of the area and the Mexican culture represented there.                                                       78 “’Muy Buenos Dias’ Gay Mexican Section Offers Latin Fiesta,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1961, pg. 13. 79 From the official Olvera Street website, “History,” John D. Trausch, https://www.olvera-street.com/history. 80 Quote featured on https://www.olvera-street.com/history. 175  The aims and desires of Sterling to construct a themed landscape dedicated to historic Mexican cultures in Los Angeles paralleled the ambitions of Six Flags Over Texas’ planners to create an interactive site for witnessing and consuming Mexican cultures and lifeways through Texas’ history. Olvera Street planners also paralleled theme parks in their efforts to create a landscape to serve as an antidote to the urban decay of the early twentieth century. But where Olvera Street planners saw cities as “a hideaway for prostitutes and street crime” in need of repair, theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas offered a faraway escape from these centers of societal corrosion.81 Regardless of these differences, the two themed entertainment sites offered remarkably similar and narrow portrayals of Mexican culture and history. As Phoebe Kropp notes, Sterling sought to “allow Anglos to reclaim some of the ‘romance and picturesqueness’ from the Mexican past, to rehabilitate the ‘cold mechanical age’ of the present.82 In doing so, Olvera Street created a bifurcated landscape that rooted Mexican cultures and peoples firmly in a romanticized and idealized past in opposition to the ascendent Anglo cultures and peoples of the present.83 The Mexican section of Six Flags Over Texas similarly featured, “Revolving serapes, spinning sombreros, tamale men, lively Mexican dancers, and colorful musicians,” that decorated the “charming and enchanting country of the caballeros and strolling mariachis.”84 The theming of the Mexican section of Six Flags                                                      81 Trausch, “History.” 82 Phoebe Kropp, “Citizens of the Past? Olvera Street and the Construction of Race and Memory in 1930s Los Angeles,” Radical History Review, Issue 81, (Fall 2001), pg. 42. 83 Kropp, pg. 36-37. 84 “Gay Mexican Section Offers Latin Fiesta,” Six Flags Gazette, Issue 1, (August 1961), pg. 11. 176  Over Texas performed similar work as Olvera Street, distancing guests in the present from the Mexican culture and Mexican people of the past. The park’s French, Spanish, Confederate, and Republic of Texas sections performed a similar function in orienting other cultures and peoples firmly in the past. In the Republic of Texas section, for example, guests encountered “the Indian Village” which included a trading post selling “everything from authentic Indian artifacts to intricate beadwork,” as well as ceremonial dancers and “the Indian chief,” who would educate guests on the history of ceremonial dances.85 Here, again, authenticity worked as part marketing strategy and part tool of cultural distancing, inviting guests to purchase, survey, and consume the cultures and histories of others. As was the case in Disneyland, this cultural distancing in Six Flags Over Texas was made starker by the presence of themed areas dedicated to the present and near future, found in the USA section of the park. Like Disneyland, this section featured futuristic rides and attractions focusing on technological advancements as a cornerstone of a distinctly American culture. This land which depicted the United States and Texas as the “vanguard(s) of undescribable [sic] progress,” was devoid of the ethnic cultures and lifeways that pervaded throughout other sections of the park. It served to divide the modern, Anglo, capitalistic culture of the present and future from the various representations of other cultures entrenched in America’s past.86                                                      85 “Six Flags Over Texas Plays To 400,000 in Two Months,” Hobbs Daily News-Sun, Hobbs, New Mexico, October 17, 1961, pg. 15. 86 Kropp calls this process a kind of “intellectual colonialism,” in “Citizens of the Past?” pg. 37. 177   The compartmentalizing of certain ethnic cultures and histories took on new meaning in the postwar era as members of these groups sought to change the social, cultural, economic, and political landscape around them. The nearby Fort Worth Star-Telegram published numerous articles throughout the 1950s and early-1960s detailing the “Indian problem”—reporting on dwindling reservations and rampant poverty in Native American communities across the nation. Although these articles smacked of a certain paternalism that paralleled the caricatures of indigenous groups in theme parks, they brought readers’ attentions to the ongoing problems prevalent in indigenous communities.87 Theme park representations of a romanticized indigenous past, then, worked as a kind of voyeuristic memorial to a former culture that stood in contrast to its lamentable contemporary representatives. It was the worst kind of public history exhibit—one which absolved visitors of reckoning with the causes behind such stark disparities between the past and present. For representations of Mexico’s cultures and peoples, Six Flags Over Texas’ depictions provided visitors with an alternative vision of Mexico’s past at a time when people of Mexican descent in Texas were organizing and shaping the methods and messaging of the Chicano movement. As with portrayals of Native American cultures and lifeways, the “caballeros” and “senoritas” of the Mexico section harkened back to a vibrant yet inoffensive and innocuous era of Mexico’s history just as Mexican men and women grew more vocal and visible in their fight for equitable pay and opportunities in                                                      87 “Problems of American Indian Complex and Misunderstood,” Joy Miller, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, March 12, 1956, pg. 8, “American Indian Population Shows Increase But His Land Is Vanishing,” Leonard J. Snyder, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 2, 1957, pg. 7. 178  Texas.88 Texans were simultaneously made intimately familiar with Mexican people in the press through the ongoing immigration issue post-Bracero program, even in Arlington, where in 1967, four were arrested for “illegal entry” after “seeking work because their families were starving.”89 As they increasingly grew visible in the present, visitors to theme parks could engage with cultures and histories of ethnic groups that consigned them to the past, rendering them simultaneously “romantic others in the past” and “dangerous outsiders in the present.”90 Within the first few years of operation, Six Flags Over Texas rose to prominence as the premier entertainment and amusement center for Texas. One 1962 article proclaimed that “in just its second season of operation,” Six Flags Over Texas had emerged “as one of the nation’s major tourist attractions.”91 A 1963 excerpt from the Dallas Morning News covering the new season expressed as much, stating that the park was “Rapidly gaining national attention as the Southwest’s giant entertainment spectacular,” attracting “Over 2,000,000 persons from 50 states” during its first two seasons.92 Another advertisement that same year boldly declared that Six Flags Over                                                      88 “Mexican-American Problems Are Cited,” C. A. Monismith, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, February 14, 1968, pg. 4-C. For more on the growth of the Chicano movement in Texas and its predecessors, see Max Krochmal, “Chicano Labor and Multiracial Politics in Post-World War II Texas,” Life and Labor in the New New South, pg. 133-176. 89 “Mexican Nationals Tell of Starvation,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, August 28, 1967, pg. 4-A. 90 Kropp, pg. 37. 91 “Attendance Runs Past 200,000,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, June 1962, pg. 6. 92 “Six Flags Over Texas,” Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, July 7, 1963, pg. 1—14. 179  Texas was “America’s foremost theme amusement park.”93 Park promoters tried their best to keep apace with Disneyland in terms of presence in the broader national and international culture throughout the first two decades. In October of 1962, the Six Flags Gazette featured a full-page spread of pictures of guests from Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, and other countries in the Americas. The article stated that these were but a few of the countless foreign guests to the park that year, and assured readers that “all agreed that there wasn’t anything anywhere to match Six Flags.”94 In July of 1964, for example, the park hosted a group of forty-four students from places like Turkey and Belgium. Coverage of their visit also celebrated the diversity of the park’s own employees, noting how hosts and hostesses were from as far away as Iran.95 But Six Flags Over Texas would remain a regional park throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Sample statistics from the opening season indicated that approximately 14.9 percent of guests were from outside of Texas, while the remaining 85.1 percent were from Texas, and most metrics in ensuing seasons would yield similar results.96 Although it was packaged as the star attraction of the Great Southwest Industrial District, it was struggled to reach the same status as the “destination parks” of Disneyland and later Disney World. Perhaps part of the issue was marketing. Advertisements for Disneyland reached an incalculably large audience throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. By contrast, Six Flags mainly advertised in Texas and neighboring states’ periodicals.                                                      93 Six Flags Advertisement, Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, September 1, 1963, pg. 4—4. 94 Photographs in Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, October 1962, pg. 3. 95 “Six Flags Sun Grins,” Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, July 2, 1964, pg. 1—9. 96 “Attendance Runs Past 200,000,” pg. 6. 180  Similarly, during its time under the ownership of the Great Southwest Corporation, marketing emphasized that the park was park of a larger industrial center aimed at attracting new industrial plants and residents to the area.97 Even as the park drew larger, nationally recognizable brands and characters into the park during the 1980s and 1990s, promoters still recognized that the majority of attendees were from the surrounding region. Marketing campaigns like “Destination Arlington” from the Arlington Convention and Visitors Bureau, which offered discounts to the park throughout Texas and the surrounding states, smartly targeted its neighbors to the South and West.98 Despite, or perhaps because of its regionality, visitors to the park seemed to take particular pride in its presentation and pristine walkways during the early decades. One visitor, H. R. Timmons of Mesquite, Texas, complained that “the Texas State Fair grounds have been disgracefully littered and filthy,” which was in stark contrast to Six Flags Over Texas,” where you never see so much as a cigarette stub on the ground.”99 Mrs. Max R. Woodward of Sherman, Texas, echoed the above sentiment when she asked, “Why can’t the State Fair of Texas look like this?”100 On the one hand, these endorsements of the park’s cleanliness were part and parcel of its own marketing rhetoric. For example, ads throughout the 1960s guaranteed that guests could find “a whole world                                                      97 See “Great Southwest Corporation” advertisement, Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, January 19, 1964, pg. 8—4. 98 “Arlington’s hotter than JULY IN TEXAS,” Janet Wilson, Austin American Statesman, Austin, Texas, June 28, 1992, pg. F15. 99 “Letters From Readers: State Fair Litter,” Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, September 16, 1963, pg. 4—4. 100 “Letters From Readers: Neatness Appreciated,” Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, October 19, 1962, pg. 4—4. 181  of entertainment, adventure and beauty” at Six Flags Over Texas.101 For these and other visitors, the cleanliness of the park was a point of pride for the region. The disreputable state of the State Fair, on the other hand, was an equally powerful refrain that worked to distinguish the suburban theme park of Six Flags Over Texas from the more carnivalesque and urban state fair.  The 1970s brought with it significant change to Six Flags Over Texas and signaled perhaps the most pronounced difference between the history and trajectory of the park and its contemporary, Disneyland. Toward the end of the 1970 operating season, Six Flags Over Texas founder, and then-president of the Great Southwest Corporation, Angus Wynne, Jr., left the company, and rumor has it that he never again set foot in the park. His departure was the fallout of a half-decade’s worth of financial maneuvering from the Penn Central Transportation Company—a merger of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Central Railroad companies. As members of the Great Southwest Corporation moved on to other projects throughout the 1960s, Penn Central began buying up stocks until they had a controlling share of the company. By 1970, they had enough leverage to force the Great Southwest Corporation into a corporate partnership to oversee the parks. When the Penn Central Transportation Company filed for bankruptcy later that year, friction between it and the Great Southwest Corporation grew too much for Wynne, Jr.102  Doug Adams, who was a reporter for the Texas News and a former Six Flags Over Texas employee during the 1960s, ruminated on Wynne, Jr.’s departure from the park in a segment from 1979 on his legacy. Adams recalled the white golf cart that Wynne, Jr.                                                      101 Advertisement in Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, August 29, 1968, pg. 5D. 102 Davis McCown, Six Flags Over Texas: The First Fifty Years, 2016, pg. 124-27. 182  used to get around and inspect the park intermittently throughout the day. He noted that, “he was more than the boss for us. He was Six Flags Over Texas, and even in the years ahead, when I come here, I don’t think I will get over the feeling that that white golf cart and Angus G. Wynne probably are around the corner.”103 Adams’ comments reflect how, from the mid-1950s until the early-1970s, theme parks were synonymous with the men that birthed them. Walt Disney created an enduring association in American culture between himself and his theme park, and Wynne, Jr., followed suit, mimicking Disney’s methods, maintaining visibility in the park during its opening years; demonstrating personal pride in the park by cleaning up cigarette butts; and promoting stories that depicted him as the patriarch of the park. When Wynne, Jr., left the company, then, Six Flags Over Texas lost what was at that time a key component of the postwar theme park in America’s cultural imaginary. Losing Wynne, Jr., in some ways prompted an identity crisis in the same way that Disney’s sudden passing in 1966 generated questions about the direction of Disneyland.      The financial issues hampered expansion plans during the early-1970s, but with Wynne, Jr. out of the picture, park planners pushed to open “Good Times Square” for the 1973 season. This new add-on to the USA section of the park was a standard carnival midway, with games and prizes and bumper cars and the like. Wynne, Jr., much like Walt Disney, was averse to carnivals and thought that they cheapened the theme park                                                      103 KXAS-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

In an effort to respond to declining ticket sales across their properties, Six Flags reoriented their focus away from an interactive history of Texas and toward a broader motif of thrill. One advertisement from 1971 promised parkgoers that, “No matter how often you go, the thrill is new,” and that there were, “85 ways to get a SIX FLAGS thrill.”105 By 1978, the park’s new slogan was “Six Flags in your Imagine Nation.” A commercial for the new roller coaster, Shockwave, in 1978 dared viewers to “Imagine the tallest, fastest, meanest double loop roller coaster in the world.”106 The opening ceremony for Shockwave still featured the sounds and symbols of Texas’s history and culture, with women dancing in cowboy hats and the band playing “Deep in the Heart of Texas,” but promotional material for the ride focused first and foremost on the ride’s record-breaking statistics.107  A 1979 commercial explained that Six Flags Over Texas was “The Entertainment Capital of Texas,” and it included a jingle that declared that the park was “fun for everyone/because it’s the capital of fun.”108 In 1982, for example, the park released                                                      104 McCown, pg. 139-41. 105 Advertisement for Six Flags featured in “Retro Ad of the Week: Six Flags Over Texas, 1971,” Gabriella Criscuolo, https://mascola.com/insights/tag/old-six-flags-ad/  106 “Six Flags Over Texas tv commercial from 1978,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrWiR72ir4s&list=PLfO6qGcpmZHck4obnBJ7CLl0lgrHVAL6n. 107 “ShockWave Grand Opening – 1978,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGVKLshZCsw&list=PLfO6qGcpmZHck4obnBJ7CLl0lgrHVAL6n&index=6 108 “1979 Six Flags Over Texas Commercial,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iV1zUOM5-k. 184  promotional material for its newest ride, The Texas Cliffhanger. In an interview with Ray Williams for Southern Methodist University’s The Daily Campus, the general manager of Six Flags Over Texas emphasized that the new ride was the first of its kind in the world. The remainder of the interview highlights some of the technical aspects of the ride and its operation, as well as some of the forces and sensations guests could expect from the unprecedented attraction. Williams concludes that “The sensation is unlike anything developed up to now. There’s no way to compare it to even the biggest of roller coasters, or any existing ride.”109  By the early-1980s, the park was already renowned for its thrilling rides, so much so that the American Coaster Enthusiasts group, formed in 1978, held its annual gathering at the park in 1981.110 Another piece from Channel 5 Action News repeated this line of thinking when they declared, “The rides. This is what most of us think about when we go to Six Flags.”111 That notoriety would persist throughout the 1990s, as the Six Flags chain would capitalize on its reputation as the go-to thrill spot in its marketing campaigns. One commercial from 1993 posed the now well-worn question of whether viewers should go to Six Flags or to Disneyland. While the commercial maintains that                                                      109 “Park unveils first freefall ride,” The Daily Campus, January 28, 1982, pg. 8. 110 KXAS-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.).

No matter where you live, there’s one nearby.”112 The commercial celebrated the bigger and faster thrills that the various parks in the chain offered guests, but underlying its sales pitch was a degree of bargaining. It acknowledged that Disneyland and Disney World were the bigger draws in terms of sheer numbers, but it hinted at the fact the Six Flags parks were decidedly more accessible.  While Disneyland struggled to market its park as a cool place for teens and young adults, Six Flags Over Texas’ ride collection and summertime events appealed to its competitor’s most cagey demographic. Throughout the 1980s, the park hosted a number of concerts and musical acts that were widely successful with the teen and young adult crowd. In August of 1985, for example, the park hosted the musical act “New Edition,” and sold over 15,000 tickets for the event. Much like its contemporaries, managers at Six Flags Over Texas still expressed anxieties over teens and young adults’ behavior and propriety during their visits to the park and its special events. At the New Edition concert, for example, dozens of attendees were taken to nearby hospitals to treat heat exhaustion and other such issues. In response, park management limited future ticket sales to 10,000. In an interview with Channel 5 News, Arlington, following the concert, a spokesperson for the park noted that only rock music acts drew in large numbers of rowdy youngsters. Country acts and other adult contemporary acts did not “attract as young and vulnerable a crowd…where people are hyperventilating.”113                                                      112 “1993 Six Flags Theme Parks TV Commercial ‘Six Flags or Disneyland’ TV Commercial,” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxXNVms6FtU 113 KXAS-TV (Television station : Fort Worth, Tex.). [News Clip: Six Flags], video, August 14, 1985, 5:00 p.m.; Fort Worth, Texas. 186  Since its opening, Six Flags Over Texas had a single ticket fee, meaning that one ticket purchased at the gate would grant access to all rides and attractions in the park without any additional charge. This policy differed from Disneyland’s own ticketing system, which charged guests a flat fee to enter the park, but then required that guests purchase ticket books to ride individual rides. Six Flags Over Texas’s ticket policy underscores its emphasis on rides and attractions first and foremost. Despite the fact that most of its marketing focused on themes of Texas history, guests could squeeze the most value out of riding the rides as frequently as possible. As such, Six Flags Over Texas has always had a reputation as a ride-centric destination compared to Disneyland. As one journalist pointed out in 1964, “The rides at Six Flags” continue to be the main attraction at the park, “perhaps because they are free.”114  Ever since the days of “La Cucaracha” and the “Runaway Mine Train,” Six Flags Over Texas has worked to establish itself as a destination for thrill seekers. During the early decades, these desires were outshone by the park’s themed elements, partly due to the concerted efforts of park promoters to foreground Texas’s history and undoubtedly partly due to the media’s new fascination with the theming in theme parks after the opening of Disneyland. As the park matured, encountering financial crises and the departure of its creator, promoters and planners capitalized on the circumstances at hand to pivot away from history as the primary organization schema and marketing rhetoric                                                      (https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1159161/m1/?q=six%20flags: accessed February 28, 2022), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, https://texashistory.unt.edu; crediting UNT Libraries Special Collections. 114 “Texas Park Combines History And Fun,” The Washington Post, Times Herald, May 17, 1964, pg. K6. 187  and toward an emphasis on record-breaking rides and attractions. Reflecting on the shift away from history as a central theme of the park and toward a theme of thrill, former park Confederate re-enactor, Sam Nesmith, lamented, “‘We had history in it,” but now, “it’s almost just an entertainment park…I hated to see that change, but hey, times change.’”115 To Nesmith’s point, Six Flags Over Texas would go on to become closely associated with thrilling rides and affordability from the 1980s onward. As the Six Flags chain grew and opened more parks around the nation, it deemphasized coherent theming and doubled down on corporate partnerships, choosing to theme rides and attractions on these partnerships and only occasionally organizing rides into somewhat intelligible and lightly themed landscapes. Although Nesmith lamented this transition, it was inevitably instrumental in diversifying the theme park market and landscape with repercussions well into the present moment.  The hosts and hostesses that populated the park were the clearest and most visible signifiers of gendered expectations, differences, and scripts at Six Flags Over Texas. As Arnett’s comment reveals, the most conspicuous demarcation was in their respective uniforms…And these uniforms remained relatively unchanged throughout the first few decades of the park. A few notable exceptions appear in the archives from time to time, such as character actor Merry “Tiger” Tuggle who roamed the Texas section performing her bull whip talent in boot-cut jeans and a sleeveless top. But coverage of these performers typically offset gender anxieties of their uncharacteristic uniforms, like when                                                      115 “Six Flags Over Texas started distancing from the Confederate battle flag decades ago.” 188  writers quipped that Tuggle “stays in practice by beating the boys away.”116  Likewise, costumes for the various Six Flags shows and spectacles followed a similar pattern, with women entertainers wearing skirts, short shorts, or gowns and men wearing shirts and pants. Whether it was the Confederate Amphitheater production of “Let’s Do It! Let’s Find A Cause” in 1966 or the Southern Palace’s “Pizzazz” in 1991, this costuming maxim remained relatively unchanged, although the latter does include one number with three young women wearing pants.117  One article mentioned how park employees “are chosen mainly on the basis of appearance, personality and character.” The article also discusses the “indoctrination and training programs” wherein new hires learn “standards of deportment, methods by which the park insures [sic] the comfort and safety of all guests, operation of rides and equipment, and maintaining the park spotlessly clean at all times.” Their main goal, then, was to “present for visitors an atmosphere of refreshing wholesomeness, genuine hospitality and a contagious feeling that everyone is having an enjoyable and fun-filled day.”118 An advertisement for the opening of the 1964 season promised that guests would “find a clean, courteous, friendly atmosphere to help every member of your family have a                                                      116 “Crack The Whip,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texan, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1962, pg. 8. 117 See, for example, pictures of the former show, “The History of Six Flags Over Texas: The Southern Palace,” http://parktimes.com/sections/confideracy/spalace.php, or video of the latter, “Six Flags Over Texas 1991 Southern Palace Show – ‘Pizzazz!’” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9P58NZjg68&t=766s. Six Flags seems to have gotten around potential confusion of women wearing pants by having them wear sleeveless tops to compensate. 118 “1,500 Hosts and Hostesses Key Six Flags Success,” Six Flags Gazette, Summer, 1967, pg. 18-19. 189  truly memorable time.”119 One article from the 1968 Summer edition of the Six Flags Gazette restated the importance of host and hostess cleanliness, counting it among the three most important aspects of the park’s continued success. It states that “the parks are manned by 1,500 college and high school students, all of whom appear to be scrubbed daily by Mr. Clean.”120 Former employee Jim Arnett related to readers of the Six Flags Over Texas former employee forum that “Uniforms were either (1) very heavily starched striped shirts & white pants, straw boater hat for guys, or starched striped dress and apron for gals; or (2) a specific costume.”121  Expectations for hosts and hostesses extended to the stage performers in the park’s many shows, as well. Charles Meeker, who was one of the primary directors and casting agents for the “Six Flags Revue” show in 1963, that “Every student to appear in the Miami auditions was a bearded beatnik,” and naturally none of them were cast in the show.122 Undergirding both Meeker’s observations about the students of Miami’s universities as well as other commentaries marveling at the clean-cut teens and young adults filling the park’s payrolls were correlating assumptions about race and sexuality in postwar youth culture. By the mid to late-1950s with the popularization of television and other visual media, consumers were familiar with discourses that linked certain ways of                                                      119 “Spectacular Family Entertainment: Six Flags ’64,” Dallas Morning News, Dallas, Texas, July 12, 1964, pg. 4—3. 120 Six Flags Gazette, Summer 1978, in Grand Prairie Daily News, Grand Prairie, Texas, April 7, 1968, pg. 5. 121 “Opening the Park,” Jim Arnett, Six Flags Over Texas Former Employee Forum, February 18, 2005, http://forums.sfot.net/showthread.php?t=83 122 “Youngsters in Revue get High Praise From Meeker,” Larry Grove, Dallas Morning News, June 19, 1963, pg. 1—8. 190  dress to racial and sexual normativity and subversion.123 White women in particular wearing masculine attire ran the risk of being accused of being a lesbian or more sexually available.124 The strict regulations on costuming and appearance served to shore up racial and gendered differences, just as it did in Disneyland.  While it is impossible to know the exact demographics of employees hired by the park during the early decades, the vast majority of those depicted in marketing materials and other, less official home videos and personal ephemera were white. The noteworthy differences were in the few attractions in the park’s “Indian Village” which primarily featured indigenous youths alongside the occasional white worker. While this was a consequence of a multitude of factors, it nonetheless served to buttress discursive links between exemplary teens and whiteness. CONCLUSION  As this chapter illustrates, Six Flags Over Texas produced themed elements and attractions that celebrated the histories of Texas and the greater United States. These histories blended education with entertainment with varying degrees of success. On the one hand, critics lauded the park for making history engaging and accessible to the youth of the region. On the other hand, the park’s version of history was one of cartoonish and racist caricatures and violence. The rides and attractions structured around Texas history consecrated histories of colonialism and subjugation and the death they wrought. It also honored the Texas of the Confederacy without a single reference to the true cause of the                                                      123 For the arrival of television and its influence on 1950s discourses of race and youth culture, see Matthew Delmont’s The Nicest Kids in Town: American Bandstand, Rock ‘n’ Roll, and the Struggle for Civil Rights in 1950s Philadelphia, pg. 15-18. 124 See Amanda Littauer’s Bad Girls, pg. 98-100. 191  Civil War—slavery. In doing so, the version of history offered by the park was critically incomplete to the point of erasing vital aspects of said history altogether. These themes simultaneously worked to render the cultures and peoples represented in most areas of the park as objects of the past that guests could interact with and consume. In contrast, the modern-day US section of the park worked to render ostensibly colorblind but unmistakably white cultures and peoples as of the present and as vanguards of the future. These two concurrent forces paralleled postwar suburban cultures with their nostalgia for a romanticized and multicultural past and simultaneous disdain for an increasingly racialized urban landscape. The park also reinforced heteronormative scripts throughout the themed areas and attractions. In celebrating death and colonialism, the park paid homage to oversimplified narratives of the West as a masculine landscape of cowboys and stage performers, or in the case of the Confederacy, of soldiers and nurses. But guests could interact with these scripts in unintended and potentially subversive ways. “College boys” could “make gag shows” at the “Six Flags Gazette” attraction, “taking turns playing the general and his wife” as they pose for their tintype photograph. “Men in bermuda shorts” could don oversized coats and pretend “as if that’s all they have on.”125 But guests’ ability to consume the images and scripts of state and national history in the park in subversive ways does not negate their power altogether. And the park often took proactive steps to curtail wily guests from stepping too far out of line. Whether it was by covering too much leg with Confederate flags or by limiting boys and girls to playing soldiers and nurses,                                                      125 “Breath of Old and New,” Six Flags Gazette-Daily News Texas, Grand Prairie, Texas, August 1962, pg. 9. 192  theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas made concerted efforts to retain their broad cultural appeal by policing boundaries as the park’s many themed elements, rides, attractions, shows, and marketing material reinforced normative gendered scripts.126  Lastly, Six Flags Over Texas served as a contemporary and constant point of comparison for the cultural—and historiographical—behemoth that was Disneyland in Anaheim, California. During the 1960s, the two parks shared comparable goals of establishing themselves as preeminent family-friendly entertainment centers. Together, Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland helped to shape popular notions of what a theme park was and how they were different from the amusement parks before them. As Six Flags Over Texas diverged from Texas history as the primary theme and marketing angle, it necessitated new conversations about what constituted a theme park in the 1970s onward. Six Flags Over Texas became the standard bearer of a new kind of theme park: one that privileged record breaking rides and attractions over immersive and cohesive theming. But, even as the park and the larger chain forged a distinct theme park identity in the late-twentieth century, they still retained their emphasis on family-friendly thrills and fun, both in terms of their marketing materials and their broader place in the public and popular culture. As such, Six Flags Over Texas never lost salience in conversations about leisure, consumption, and the American family in the context of the twentieth century.                                                      126 A hostess allegedly draped the flag over a man’s legs to cover his short shorts in a tintype photograph, “Breath of Old and New.” 193  Chapter 4: Gay Days: The Fight for LGBTQ Inclusion in Theme Parks  One of the earliest recorded LGBTQ theme park parties took place at Disneyland on May twenty-fifth, 1978. Studio One, a Los Angeles area disco dance club, and The Tavern Guild of Los Angeles, a collective of community bars and restaurants, helped to organize the private event which took place after closing time from 8:00 PM to 1:00 AM. Stories allege that The Tavern Guild slipped by the Disneyland Operations Department by applying for permission to host the private party under the non-existent Los Angeles Bar and Restaurant Association.1 According to the recollection of Scott Forbes, the founder of the Studio One Disco and Backlot and co-organizer of the event, however, he and Carol Taylor-DiPietro, a park employee, submitted their application as the Los Angeles Tavern Guild.2 Regardless, Forbes and Taylor-DiPietro were apprehensive about their application, even after the party had been approved by Disneyland. The organizers marketed the event as a “Family Fun Night” at Disneyland and sold tickets through member restaurants of The Tavern Guild. Similarly, organizers generated a “code of behavior flyer, which included ‘no drags’ and attire of ‘clean nature with no lewd sayings or pictures.’”3                                                      1 Sean Griffin sites David Koenig’s Mouse Tales: A Behind-the Ears Look at Disneyland, in his own work on the queer history of Disney, Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out,” pg. 126-27. 2 The conflicting accounts could be a miscommunication, or because the latter information comes from the Studio One Disco-Backlot Theatre application for the National Register of Historic Places, pg. 52. http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1067/files/ca_los%20angeles_mitchell%20camera.pdf 3 Excerpt from application for the National Register of Historic Places, pg. 53. 194  The event by and large did not attract much attention from newspapers and other media outlets in part due to an alleged ban on press. The Honolulu Advertiser published a quick mention of the event the day of, and Herman Wong lists it among other potential future gay friendly events in a widely syndicated Los Angeles Times article, but event organizers managed to keep the planned “Family Night” under wraps for the most part.4 But, one article from Alan Cartnal in New West magazine’s July third issue did manage to report on some of the night’s festivities. Although it was one of the only editorial-length articles about the event, it was nonetheless illustrative of the ways in which members of the LGBTQ community would report about their efforts to vie for space and inclusion in theme parks for the remainder of the twentieth century. Despite being from a straight author, Cartnal’s article was also revealing of the broader methods and messaging that accompanied LGBTQ community members’ efforts to claim space outside theme parks, as well, throughout the late-twentieth century.  From the outset, Cartnal’s article, “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn?” evoked the surprising nature of the community’s attempts to party at the family-friendly Disneyland. He contends that “Disneyland is Anita Bryant territory—the home of Uncle Walt—the citadel of every middle-class, pristine value that has ever been perpetrated on the fantasies of America.”5 His comment insinuated that, for many New West readers, the values and tenets of Disneyland were incongruous with the LGBTQ community writ large, so it was a wonder that the latter would even attempt to infiltrate the former. Anita                                                      4 “More On Same,” The Honolulu Advertiser, Honolulu, Hawaii, May 26, 1978, pg. C12. See also, “Gay bar businesses boom, if they survive hassles, hustles,” Herman Wong, Los Angeles Times in The Sun, Biloxi, Mississippi, August 27, 1978, pg. C1-2. 5 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn?” Alan Cartnal, New West, July 3, 1978, pg. 94. 195  Bryant was at the forefront of the Save Our Children from Homosexuality (shortened to just Save Our Children usually) campaign in Florida and across the US South in particular in the late-1970s where she argued that homosexuality more broadly and gay male schoolteachers in particular were a threat to children.6 Cartnal’s actual goal with this comment, then, was to convince readers who might balk at the thought of LGBTQ individuals celebrating their culture and identities in America’s theme park that there was significant overlap between the two, or that the LGBTQ community was not so different than non-member readers. His comment evoked the images of America’s uncle and the conservative demagogue who represented in the culture of the time the defenders of children from the existential threat posed by homosexuality. Cartnal’s job, then, was to convince readers that these revelers were anything but threats to the family and child. In short, Cartnal’s article was in favor of LGBTQ efforts to claim space in Disneyland, but his messaging echoed the rhetoric and strategies of the era that would later get lumped into the somewhat maligned category of respectability politics. One constant strategy in the politics of respectability toolkit was to assure readers and observers that the deeply political action of queers claiming space was actually not political at all. In the article, Cartnal calls Scott Forbes, one of the event coordinators, “the leader of disco gay culture, a man who has nothing to do with political movements and much to do with gay marketing.”7 This sentiment is repeated later in the article when he states that, “No political speeches were made. No pamphlets were passed out. The biggest protest was not over human rights, but rather that gay couples, arm in arm and                                                      6 See Robert O. Self’s All in the Family, pg. 242-46. 7 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn,” pg. 94. 196  looking quite middle-class, had to wait two hours to get a meal at Blue Bayou.”8 This line of logic was appealing to readers of the late-1970s who were growing weary of the radical politics of the 1960s and early-1970s.9 It also appealed to a particularly visible and vocal cohort of LGBTQ activists who wanted to demystify homosexuality and to write back against the likes of Bryant and other conservatives who painted them as dangerous to kids and to the family.  Another hallmark of the strategies of respectability politics is the appeal to middle-class values and principles, and for the mid and late-twentieth century, the most accessible value for LGBTQ individuals, especially in the context of the theme park, was that of the middle-class consumer. In the article, Cartnal remarked that the event was the dawning “of a new culture and a new marketplace”10 For some, including Cartnal and the organizers of the event, the relative success of the event was proof that gay men and lesbian women could assimilate into a relatively heteronormative, middle-class culture and society. As Cartnal argues in his article, “What this whole Gay Nite at Disneyland thing is all about is that gays are going straight. They’re infiltrating straight-line society.” He even posits that there could be a future “Gay Nite at the White House,” or a “Gay Nite with the Daughters of the American Revolution.”11 These comments tapped into contemporary discourses of private consumer rights. They also satirized the rhetoric of                                                      8 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn,” pg. 97. 9 Kristen Hoerl rightly points out that some of this fatigue was manufactured by conservative politicians and media in the mid and late-1970s in an effort to depict activism in the 1960s as negative and ineffectual. See The Bad Sixties: Hollywood Memories of the Counterculture, Antiwar, and Black Power Movements. 10 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn,” pg. 94. 11 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn,” pg. 97. 197  infiltration, which was a popular device of conservatives, particularly in the Cold War Era. The purging of gay and lesbian federal employees in the previous two decades, also known as the “Lavender Scare,” was proof alone that the rhetoric of subversion and infiltration was a powerful one.12 It followed, then, that LGBTQ activists should work to convince the reading public that they were not the things conservatives claimed them to be. For people like Cartnal, DiPietro, and Forbes, “Gay Nite” was a chance to demonstrate precisely that, and what better place to do so than the foremost monument to the American child and family.  On the one hand, the 1978 “Gay Nite” was an opportunity for LGBTQ celebrants to “proclaim their own rich culture” at “a straight, American monument” like Disneyland. But public-facing reports of the private event give a somewhat singular version or interpretation of that rich culture. Cartnal’s article makes subtle references to “amyl nitrate-saturated” screening rooms and the converting of the 20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea attraction into “a red-lit gay bar,” but the article’s clear purpose is to convince readers of the closeness between gay and lesbian culture and straight, middle-class American values.13 To the knowledgeable readers, Cartnal’s reference to amyl nitrate—an inhalant colloquially known as “poppers” used during anal sex—was a tantalizing bit of information that bolstered rumors of other sexual activities occurring at “Gay Nite.” It celebrated that provocative aspect of LGBTQ culture and communities that linked sexuality to public displays of sex acts. Despite this quick nod to the hip readers, though,                                                      12 See David K. Johnson, The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government.  13 “What’s Gotten Into The Matterhorn,” pg. 97.  198  Cartnal’s article is made to convince people that the gays present at Disneyland’s inaugural “Gay Nite” were vivacious and vibrant but altogether inoffensive. In doing so, though, he mirrored other LGBTQ activists of the time by downplaying or obscuring aspects of the celebration and of the broader community that were increasingly seen as adverse to the cause of LGBTQ rights and equality.   This chapter focuses on the presence of LGBTQ identified individuals, communities, and organizations in Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas. It also examines the broader presence of these two parks and their brands in the larger LGBTQ culture and community. As LGBTQ individuals sought to claim space in these bastions of family-friendly entertainment and leisure, they inevitably relied on a cluster of methods and messaging that would retroactively and critically be called respectability politics. These highly visible social events and celebrations were treated as presentations of a particular LGBTQ culture and politics to the broader public. On the defense from conservatives of the 1950s onward who declared homosexuality as the foremost threat to the child and the family, organizers of LGBTQ events at theme parks saw them as an opportunity to show the world that they were not only non-threatening, but just like normal, straight, middle-class people. In anecdotes, rumors, and other less organized retellings of “Gay Nite” events and its descendants, LGBTQ individuals revealed tensions between the respectability politics of the organizers and other queer social and cultural practices, impromptu or otherwise. Furthermore, references to Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland in the broader LGBTQ culture occurred in far more diverse and intimate places, like the back pages and obituaries of queer periodicals. These references 199  underscore that these two theme parks intersected with queer lives in unique ways that were not always captured in public claims for space.    Although the state of the gay rights and other LGBTQ social movements in the 1980s are increasingly well documented in contemporary histories, particularly in states like California, it is important to pull back and examine the political, social, and cultural climate of the Dallas-Fort Worth region to better understand the conditions under which the area LGBTQ community sought to make space for itself at Six Flags Over Texas. Although little has been written about the LGBTQ community in Arlington, it appears to exhibit many of the same features of small, college-town communities in the US South and Sunbelt. The University of Texas at Arlington served as an intellectual and social center for an admittedly small but influential group in the local LGBTQ community, and it also served as a place of gathering for conferences and other cultural and intellectual events that brought members from outside the town. Rhonda Carlson of the National Gay Task Force attended the school’s Graduate Social Work program in the late-1970s, researching lesbian identity and community formation from a national perspective.14 The UTA Women’s Center was a conduit for many feminist and lesbian feminist events and gatherings throughout the late-1970s, as well. They helped to sponsor a Women’s Festival in the fall of 1980 in Arlington, which brough all-women’s music acts and other                                                      14 “Lesbians Defining Themselves,” NGTF Action Report Opportunities for Action/Reports on Results December 1978, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Historical Society, accessed through Gale Primary Source Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 200  spokespeople for feminist issues to the area.15 By 1981, the university acknowledged the validity of its student-ran Gay/Lesbian Association—University of Texas at Arlington, which hosted approximately twenty to thirty students per meeting.16 In 1989, the university allowed its first class solely dedicated to LGBTQ culture when Professor Charles Kneupper taught Gay Rhetoric.17 These events, collegiate organizations, and LGBTQ classes illustrate that there was a small but active intellectual community at the University, one that surely influenced both cultural and political organizing in the region from the late-1970s onward.   In terms of LGBTQ bars and other such social gather spots, Arlington seemed to lack many options outside of a handful short-lived establishments. Clubs like Bloomers Britches, the 651, the 851 Club, and Tarrant County Mining Company all get mentions by LGBTQ individuals and community publications in the historical record, but it is hard to find definitive timelines for these establishments.18 Arlington also had a local chapter                                                      15 “Women’s Music Festival Inspires, Teaches, Heals,” Sister Advocate, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Vol. 6, No. 6, pg. 6, Lesbian Herstory Archives, accessed through Gale Primary Source Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 16 “UTA Group Receives Okay,” Metro Times, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 1, No. 25, March 19, 1981, pg. 13, Lesbian Herstory Archives, accessed through Gale Primary Source Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 17 “Kneupper Memorial Library Opens at UT-Arlington,” LGSN Lesbian and Gay Studies Newsletter, Vol. 18, No. 1, March 1991, pg. 1, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Historical Society, accessed through Gale Primary Source Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 18 “Division Street Dive Bar Shares Long, Colorful Roots,” Karen Gavis, Arlington Community News website blog, November 20, 2017, https://www.arlingtoncommunitynews.com/single-post/2017/11/20/division-street-dive-bar-shares-long-colorful-roots, “Doing America with Bob Damron: Fort Worth,” Out!

As such, rather than viewing Arlington’s LGBTQ community as small and insular, it is more accurate to consider them as part of the broader Dallas-Fort Worth community, just as Arlington and Six Flags Over Texas were often envisioned as parts of the greater Southwest entertainment corridor and Metroplex.20 Doing so underscores how migration and cross-pollination were part and parcel of LGBTQ culture and politics in the region from the 1970s onward.       By 1982, members of the community had successfully challenged and put a temporary stop to the enforcement of a state law that criminalized “deviant sexual intercourse” when Donald F. Baker brought the issue to court. The court ruled that “everybody should be free from undue state interference in important and intimate matters,” but opponents of their ruling soon rose up to appeal the decision. The attorneys                                                      19 From the group’s history webpage, it appears that Fort Worth clubs were the primary sites of organizing for this Court, and it is unclear to what degree Arlington’s LGBTQ community and establishments were involved, http://www.icfwa.org/history.html. 20 This argument echoes those made by historians of rural LGBTQ communities. See, for example, John Howard, Men Like That: A Southern Queer History, William J. Spurlin, “What?! Queers in the Midwest?” in Reclaiming the Heartland, Mary L. Gary, Out in the Country: Youth, Media, and Queer Visibility in Rural America, James T. Sears, Rebels, Rubyfruit, and Rhinestones: Queering Space in the Stonewall South, Brock Thompson, The Un-Natural State: Arkansas and the Queer South, Ryan Powell, “Queer Interstates: Cultural Geography and Social Contact in Kansas City Trucking Co. and El Paso Wrecking Corp.,” in Queering the Countryside: New Frontiers in Rural Queer Studies. 202  representing the plaintiffs in the appeal contended that the right to privacy should be limited to “family, marriages, procreation and children-rearing only.” They also maintained that homosexual men, in particular, were a danger to the state given the pervasiveness of AIDS among their numbers, and consequently needed to be penalized.21 Unfortunately, the appeal was successful, and the state’s anti-sodomy law remained in effect until 2003’s Lawrence v. Texas. A statement from the fifth Circuit Court of Appeals alleged that it did so “in view of the strong objection to homosexual conduct which has prevailed in western culture for the past seven centuries.”22 Danny Hill, the District Attorney who filed the second appeal, argued that his party’s success affirmed “that the states have the right to legislate in the areas where the people want them to legislate.”23  In the aftermath of the successful appeal, Arlington police performed a widely publicized sting operation at Randol Mill Park, and made other less premeditated arrests using the reinstated statute.24 Overall reception to these types of operations was overwhelmingly negative, with the media lambasting Arlington police for the costly and unnecessary endeavor, especially given the district attorney’s reluctance to take the offenders to court.25 Homosexual activity and Randol Mill Park continued to make                                                      21 “Privacy not guaranteed to gays, lawyers argue,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, Texas, April 19, 1984, pg. 24A. 22 “’AIDS hysteria’ is blamed for upholding sodomy law,” R.G.

They did, however, add the important caveat that they viewed homosexuality “as a deviation from God’s norm,” and somewhat patronizingly suggested that “At the heart of homosexuality is a deep loneliness” that their services sought to remedy.28 They attempted to work within the parameters of popular discourses at the time and appealed to a sweeping right to privacy, such as when Thomas J. Coleman, Jr., of the Texas Human Rights Foundation claimed that “The Supreme Court has given permission to Big Brother to come into our homes and invade our privacy.”29 But the community also had trouble combatting public protests to other LGBTQ cultural events. One minor, but illustrative case occurred in September of 1984, when conservative city councilors objected to a local production of the play Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. The director of the play decided to cast an all-male production of the play about a childless couple which                                                      26 “Klansmen plan park gathering: Gays lure Klan to Randol Mill,” Luke Johnson, The Arlington Citizen-Journal, Arlington, Texas, Vol. 102, No. 17, July 10, 1985, pg. 1A. 27 “Norwood criticizes rate of convictions,” Clara Tuma, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, March 6, 1985, pg. 20A. 28 “’Societies of hate have no home’ in Arlington,” David A.

A15. 204  prompted city officials to protest and eventually stop the play’s run. The play also drew pushback from the local chapter of the National Federation for Decency, who objected to the homosexual couplings of the main characters, and to the re-writing of the original intention of the play.30 These cultural and legal contests also helped to inform the rhetoric that seeped into other avenues of local activism, including in efforts to establish an LGBTQ event at Six Flags Over Texas. They revealed that Arlington’s LGBTQ community was highly mobile and attuned to the issues of the greater Dallas-Fort Worth region, which was likewise attuned to broader national conversations around anti-sodomy legislation. They also demonstrated that local activists were willing to test the legal waters and to bring issues of discrimination to the courts, although the results of these cases show that legislatures were still reluctant to overturn certain state laws. The Randol Mill Park incidents are instrumental as they illustrate a direct contest over public space. Although the park was long associated in public memory with explicit homosexual sex acts, media outlets were keener to critique overzealous police surveillance, which meant that these acts and individuals were neither empowered nor outright condemned by the media. And as the outcry over the all-male production of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf showed, city officials were willing to push back against visible LGBTQ cultural products at the local level. As such, the community would continue to struggle for legal, cultural, and social legitimacy throughout the remainder of the 1980s and 1990s.                                                       30 “In a Nutshell: Who’s Afraid of Whom?” Out: Madison’s Lesbian/Gay Newspaper, Madison, Wisconsin, Vol. 2, No. 10, September 1984, pg. 2, Lesbian Herstory Archives, accessed through Gale Primary Source Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 205   Of the two theme parks, Six Flags Over Texas seems to have the longest running consecutive yearly “gay day” daytime events. As early as 1983, LGBTQ community groups in and around the Dallas area reported hosting “gay day” activities at Six Flags Over Texas, as well as at other spots across town. The Oak Lawn Bowling Association organized a “gay day” at the park in June of 1983 to raise money for the AIDS Action Project of the Oak Lawn Counseling Center.31 One article covering the June “gay day” in 1983 stated that “a gay time was had by all, especially at the Southern Palace where Hot Tea learned the show was exceptional.”32 Whether the comment was in reference to the subject and style of the theatrical shows at the Southern Palace or to the performers is unclear. Regardless, the author of “Hot Tea” affirms that gays and lesbians could find fun in the family-friendly theme park, although what kind was left to the imagination of the reader. Similarly, in 1983, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram published an in-depth look into Fort Worth’s LGBTQ community, focusing on gay men and the AIDS crisis in the city. Part of the article covers the various community-based organizations and social groups in Fort Worth that created what author Chris Evans called “a de facto underground network” that operated “as efficiently as free enterprise itself, as quietly as the couple next door.”33 As with groups in Dallas, the Fort Worth gay community hosted “gay days” at Six Flags Over Texas and the Nearby Wet N’ Wild waterpark. And “gay days” were not reserved for theme park visits, as demonstrated throughout the mid-1980s, when the                                                      31 “Hot Tea: Six Flags,” This Week In Texas, Vol. 9, No. 14, June 24-30, 1983, pg. 71. http://www.houstonlgbthistory.org/Houston80s/TWT/1983/83-062483.compressed.pdf. 32 “Hot Tea: Tattle Tale,” This Week In Texas, Vol. 9, No. 13, June 17-23, 1983, pg. 73. http://www.houstonlgbthistory.org/Houston80s/TWT/1983/83-061783.compressed.pdf 33 “FW gays concerned by AIDS backlash,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Oct. 16, 1983, pg. 10c. 206  Dallas Gay Alliance hosted “Gay Day” at the Dallas Sidekicks soccer game and other such outings.34  By 1985, the Dallas Gay Alliance was the most visible organizer of “gay day” festivities at Six Flags Over Texas. In 1985, the organization hosted at least two “gay day” events: one in April and another in June. In one advertisement for the April “gay day” event, Skipper Wilson of the Dallas Gay Alliance promised that participants could expect “Rides, puppets, cruising, cotton candy, fun and action.”35 In 1989, however, the Dallas chapter of the Texas Gay Rodeo Association began hosting their own “gay day” at Six Flags Over Texas in the Spring. These events were often planned and organized by individual members vying for titles, such as when Tony Valdez and De Shannon sponsored a “Gay Day at Six Flags” to fulfill their fundraising duties as candidates for Mr. and Miss Texas Gay Rodeo Association, or when “Chili” of the Dallas area did the same for his candidacy as Mr. Texas Gay Rodeo Association.36 The event doubled as a fundraiser for the local community, with portions of the tickets sales going to organizations like the Dallas AIDS Resource Center, Bryan’s House, and the Metropolitan Community Church.37 They also were not the only groups organizing “gay day” events that year, as the Gay and Lesbian Young Adults group of the Dallas Gay                                                       34 “Gay Days Are Back,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 1, No. 40, February 8, 1985, pg. 3. 35 “Hot Tea: Six Flags Gay Day,” This Week In Texas, April 12-18, 1985, pg. 73. http://www.houstonlgbthistory.org/Houston80s/TWT/1985/85-041285.compressed.pdf 36 “Announcements: TGRA Gay Day At Six Flags,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 6, No. 14, August 4, 1989, pg. 6, “Gay Day At Six Flags,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 6, No. 17, August 25, 1989, pg. 6. 37 See example of 1989 “gay day” in Dallas Voice, Vol. 6, No. 16, August 18, 1989, pg. 14. https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth615767/m1/14/?q=%22gay%20day%22. 207  Alliance also hosted a “Gay Day At Six Flags” in the summer of 1989.38 This trend of individuals organizing fundraising “gay day” events at Six Flags Over Texas on behalf of the Texas Gay Rodeo Association continued through the early and mid-1990s. More loosely organized social groups also held daytime events at the park during the mid-1990s, such as in 1996 when members of the community hosted “Bears Day Out at Six Flags.”39  By the late-1990s, “gay day” at Six Flags Over Texas had changed its name to the “Gay and Lesbian Community Day.” Part of the rebranding also included a shift in tone away from sly sexual innuendo and toward wearing “rainbow pride colors or company, business or organizational T-shirts to show a positive image at the theme park.”40 The 1997 event was heralded as “The first Gay and Lesbian Community Day at Six Flags Over Texas” organized by the LGBTQ periodical, Dallas Voice and was co-sponsored by over forty state organizations.41 The event would include an opening ceremony, and attendance estimates held that over 6,000 LGBTQ community members entered the park that day.42 That same year, Brian Mellott of The Texas Guardian proposed to host a “Two Dads-Two Moms Gay Family Day Out at Six Flags” in part as a response to the Southern Baptist Convention’s boycotting of Disney.43 As the name of the event                                                      38 “Gay Day At Six Flags,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 6, No. 10, July 7, 1989, pg. 15. 39 “Calendar,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 13, No. 13, July 26, 1996, pg. 34. 40 “Texas Tea: Dallas Tea,” This Week In Texas, September 5-11, 1997, pg. 63. 41 “Gay and Lesbian Community Day At Six Flags Over Texas,” Dallas Voice, September 26, 1997, pg. 8, “Gay Day At Six Flags Update,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 14, No. 18, August 29, 1997, pg. 9. 42 “Gay and Lesbian Community Day At Six Flags Over Texas.” 43 Mellott admits that he began organizing the event prior to the boycott but began promoting the event as a counter-protest in its aftermath. 208  suggests, part of its purpose was to demonstrate how, as Gil Flores of the Gay & Lesbian Community Center in Dallas expressed, “Traditional families have changed. So this is just kind of counter-attacking the issue we have been attacked on.”44 His comments signaled that, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, community members often retooled rhetoric historically used against them in their efforts to claim space for LGBTQ individuals.  Detractors also made claims to space, such as when the Rev. Gary Smith of Fielder Road Baptist Church in Arlington stated that he was “disappointed that we have this here in our own back yard.”45 Similar to protests over Disneyland’s “Gay Day” events, the Six Flags Over Texas “Gay and Lesbian Community Day” events throughout the 1990s received little push-back from outside commentators.46 Just like the inaugural 1978 “Gay Nite,” this relative lack of objections to LGBTQ events in theme parks might be attributed to their effective absence outside of community periodicals. Very few articles mention these events at Six Flags Over Texas in the first place, which meant that attendees had to be in-the-know, so to speak, to register their complaints in advance. In response to the proposed gay and lesbian family day, one woman stated that, “I wouldn’t come on that day, but I think it’s fine.”47                                                      44 “Gay, lesbian day planned at Six Flags: Reverend ‘disappointed’ that park is allowing event,” Valerie Fields, Arlington Morning News, Arlington, Texas, June 25, 1997, https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/19182650/download-file-the-six-flags-museum. 45 “Gay, lesbian day planned at Six Flags.” 46 Even into the early-2000s, protests almost exclusively came from Evangelical Christian groups. 47 “Gay, lesbian day planned at Six Flags.” 209   The Six Flags Corporation’s official response to “gay day” activities in the park was in line with Disney’s policies during the 1980s and 1990s. In fact, before 1997, the park seemed largely quiet with regard to the various “gay day” outings. It was not until the 1997 “Two Dads-Two Moms Gay Family Day Out at Six Flags” that spokesperson for Six Flags, Nancy St. Pierre, declared that “We cannot deny access to anybody.” Writer Valerie Fields clarified for readers of the Arlington Morning News that Six Flags, “which promotes itself as family-oriented, is not sponsoring the event.”48 Official park policy appeared to be to handle the group as they would with any other by allowing them the group discount, but not officially sponsoring or promoting the event. This policy kept Six Flags Over Texas from encountering any legal issues or much else in the way of public backlash from either party. Interestingly enough, it was Disneyland’s neighbor, Six Flags Magic Mountain, that was the first park in the Six Flags chain to find itself in court over discriminatory policies. In 1985, the park rejected Valerie Heekin’s request to host a “Gay Pride Night” private celebration after hours. As with the Exler case and Disneyland, Superior Court Judge Robert O’Brien “ruled that Six Flags Magic Mountain violented the state Unruh Civil Rights Act.”49  Although Mellott’s “Two Dads-Two Moms Gay Family Day out at Six Flags” seems to never have come to fruition, it and the actual “Gay and Lesbian Community Day” events at Six Flags Over Texas highlight how local LGBTQ community members and activists in particular employed the language of the family in their efforts to claim                                                      48 “Gay, lesbian day planned at Six Flags.” 49 “Victory at Magic Mountain,” Mom Guess What!

While advertisements for the 1985 “Gay Day at Six Flags” promised, as mentioned above, cruising and other salacious forms of fun to readers of the LGBTQ periodical, This Week In Texas, by the 1990s, more public facing articles about similar events were decidedly less candid about sex and other illicit activities. Even queer newspapers took to policing their tone when discussing outings in the park. Prior to the 1997 “Gay and Lesbian Community Day” at Six Flags Over Texas, Robert Moore, who was one of the primary event organizers, made a point to remind attendees that the day was “not intended as a rally or political event, but as a fun gathering emphasizing gay and lesbian unity.” The expressed theme of the event was “gay and lesbian visibility,” but organizers were quick to draw distinctions—counterintuitive as they may have seemed—between visibility and political activism.50  Publicity for the 1996 “Gay and Lesbian Day” at Six Flags Over Texas highlights this point of transition toward a more visible, yet perhaps more toned-down version of celebrations in the park. The event listing in the Dallas Voice told readers that “visible presence [was] encouraged by wearing rainbow colors, lambda symbols and other accessories of pride.”51 This advertisement for the event in the broader community publication of the Dallas Voice shows how promoters downplayed overt references to sex and sexuality in favor of a more palatable motif of pride. And by the late-1990s, the rhetoric of pride was already inextricably linked to assimilationist politics and relatively normative social practices rooted in visible lesbian or gay identities. By way of contrast,                                                      50 “Large crowd expected for Gay Day at Six Flags,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 14, No. 21, September 19, 1997, pg. 14. 51 “Calendar,” Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 13, No. 20, September 13, 1996, pg. 43. 211  coverage of the event in Woman Space asked readers, “Just imagine a Log Flume full of wet lesbians,” and promised that attendees could “be a part of these and other exotic happenings” at “Gay and Lesbian Day.”52 In this and other less widely-circulated LGBTQ periodicals, authors unabashedly referenced—nay, guaranteed—public queer erotic spectacles, although these were also tied to a more or less coherent lesbian identity. Although these events from the 1970s onward were the most visible intersection of Six Flags Over Texas and the LGBTQ community, gays and lesbians in Texas made frequent references to the park in other, more intimate and personal ways. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, gay men and lesbian women sought companions to Six Flags Over Texas trips in magazine back pages and personal ads. One ad from July twenty-fourth, 1992, for example, featured a Black lesbian woman looking “for friendship, movies, dinner, Six Flags & pleasant conversation.”53 One woman marketing herself as a career-oriented provider sought a “feminine woman who will make me write hot checks, call in sick,” and who would visit Six Flags and bingo halls with her.54 Another ad from December of 1994 featured a gay Black man whose interests included “Baskin Robbins, slow and gentle all nite long love making (or heart pounding ‘action’ any time at all), going out dancing, staying home, working out, FW Zoo and Six Flags.”55 Occasionally, subscribers used the personals hot-line to solicit missed connections made in the park,                                                      52 “Gay and Lesbian Day at Six Flags,” Woman Space, San Antonio, Texas, Vol. 8, No. 11, September 1996, pg. 3. 53 “Voice to Voice Personals,” Dallas Voice, July 24, 1992, pg. 38. 54 “Voice to Voice: Personals, Dallas Voice, July 31, 1992, pg. 38. 55 The FW stood for Fort-Worth, Texas, “Voice to Voice: Personals,” Dallas Voice, December 23, 1994, pg. 42. 212  such as in 1995 when one man inquired about another man who played the part of a cowboy in the Six Flags Hot Rockin’ Country Show.56    Dallas Voice also ran a weekly article called “Gossip” regularly throughout the 1990s, where they would blend anecdotes with witty word play about members of the community. The column was also used to highlight area events at clubs like Wave’s Wet Boxer Shorts contests or Brief Encounters Party in the summer of 1992. The articles also featured frequent mentions Six Flags Over Texas, ranging from reminders of upcoming events to esoteric references to drag queens stalking men in tight pants around the park.57 These numerous stories of Six Flags visits help to illustrate that the park was a common gathering place for LGBTQ individuals from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. These gatherings ranged from the highly organized “Gay Day” type events to more clandestine meetings or even references to potential LGBTQ encounters in the park. As stated earlier, these references underscore the wide array of ways Six Flags Over Texas manifested in Texas’s LGBTQ communities. While most references come from lesbian or gay identified people and their writings, they do also hint at ways in which broader practices of queering the family-friendly Sunbelt theme park may have materialized during this era.58  Six Flags Over Texas may not have had the same weight in the broader LGBTQ culture beyond the Dallas-Fort Worth region as Disneyland did during the latter-half of the twentieth century, but it still managed to have some visible salience in LGBTQ                                                      56 “Voice to Voice: Lost & Found,” Dallas Voice, September 22, 1995, pg. 86. 57 “Gossip,” Dallas Voice, August 7, 1992, pg. 35. 58 As covered in the introduction, these broader practices are harder to locate in the archive. 213  media. The phrase “Gay Six Flags” or and similar configuration did not exist to the same degree that “Gay Disneyland” did in LGBTQ periodicals, as the next section will highlight, but it still functioned in fascinating ways. In 1984, for example, writer Heda Quote of the Dallas Voice described an elevator ride as “kinda like being at Six Flags.”59 In 1985, Quote compared the nightclub TR-II’s Halloween decorations to “a ride at Six Flags” or “a branch of Carlsbad Caverns” with its immersive cave-like atmosphere.60 Quote’s first invocation of Six Flags is altogether ambiguous, and even his second quote leaves much to the imagination. “Gay Disneyland” and other such phrases were more pervasive in LGBTQ periodicals and had clearer meanings for the most part. But these few references to Six Flags signals that the LGBTQ community imagined the park as a sort of otherworldly spectacle. It was a place of performance and pageantry, much like any theme park, and as such possessed many qualities endearing to queer people. That Texas’s LGBTQ individuals and communities fought for inclusion in these spaces, then, is no surprise.  As discussed at length in chapters two and three, Disneyland emerged throughout the latter half of the twentieth century not only as the prototypical theme park, but as the quintessential place for family-friendly leisure and entertainment. It also evolved into a rhetorical device of sorts in the broader American culture, used to confer only the highest degree of prestige and allure to whatever it followed. From the late-1970s onward, for example, the phrase “Gay Disneyland” gained currency in LGBTQ periodicals and in the                                                      59 “Heda Quote,” Heda Quote, Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 1, No. 9, July 6, 1984, pg. 19. 60 “Gossip: Heda has words of wisdom for single girls on the go,” Heda Quote, Dallas Voice, Dallas, Texas, Vol. 3, No. 27, November 7, 1986, pg. 16. 214  broader community. It was used to describe places as must-see attractions, or otherwise to indicate that said place or some event was bound to be really really gay. Most often, the term “Gay Disneyland” and its equivalents were applied to towns like San Francisco, New York City, or Provincetown, Massachusetts.61 Most often, the phrase was used endearingly or in praise, but there was always a degree of absurdity underlying most…One review published in the Bay Area Reporter of the screenplay for 1965’s Who Killed Teddy Bear? called it “a Disneyland of sexual dysfunction.”62 Another 1996 syndicated column by Tony Snow noted that “Political wags refer to the Republican National Committee as ‘Gay Disneyland’ because many of the finest and most dedicated minds in the party practice the love that dare not mention its name.”63  And gay men were not the only ones to use Disneyland as descriptive turns of phrases. In 1996, Kitaka Gara promoted her new lesbian social club and bar as a “‘lesbian Disneyland’ (only with higher odds of getting laid.)”64 Sometimes, the term represented a degree of unmet potential with regard to certain aspects of the queer community. In 1995, for example, Elliot Linwood of the Bay Area Reporter published a conversation with performance artists Justin Chin and Wayne Corbitt, whose works broadly contended with the experiences of queer people of color in San Francisco. Chin laments that “many of us                                                      61 Provincetown was called “the gay and lesbian Disneyland” in “Cheryl Wheeler’s world-class irreverence,” Mara Math, Gay Community News, Vol. 16, No. 47, 1989, pg. 12, “Cornerstones Of Desire,” Dan Levy, The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco, California, June 22, 1997, pg. 6. 62 “A walk on the wild side: Sal Mineo bares almost all in Who Killed Teddy Bear?” Robert Julian, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 26, No. 23, June 6, 1996, pg. 33.  63 “’Ellen’ real test for extremists,” Tony Snow, Asheville Citizen-Times, Asheville, North Carolina, September 26, 1996, pg.

As discussed previously, Disney was already an established brand associated with childhood and the American family. LGBTQ references to the Disneyland park, then, were in part a subversion of these cultural associations. It was a discursive claiming of space, in a way, with LGBTQ individuals and communities coopting the rhetoric of Disneyland as the preeminent heteronormative family leisure space and applying it to their own queer canon. These practices coincided with efforts to claim actual space in the park through organized “Gay Day” type events from the late-1970s onward, and with other, less identity-bound occurrences of queering the “Happiest Place on Earth.”   In 1985, The Disney Channel ran a thirty-minute special on the history of one of Disneyland’s longest running shows, “The Golden Horseshoe Revue.” The short film focuses on interview segments with performers Wally Boag and Fulton Burley, each of whom details their lives before joining the show in the park. Boag mentions that his                                                      65 “Their Difference is Divine,” Elliot Linwood, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 24, No. 25, June 25, 1994, pg. 37. 66 Quoted in, “Gay Bars Flourish In Downtown Area As Places To Relax, Find Partners,” Bill Lindelof, The Sacramento Bee, September 12, 1982, pg. A17. 216  background in vaudeville shows made him an attractive candidate to Walt, who wanted this live rendition of the story of Pecos Bill—and who himself was a vaudeville performer in Kansas City in the 1920s—to feature the fast-paced wordplay and physical comedy stylings of early-twentieth century vaudeville theater. During the interview, Boag demonstrates one of his bits where he is a psychologist psychoanalyzing the way people blow up a balloon. As he describes one of his patients, Boag inflates a pink balloon and pinches and prods until it is oddly phallic-shaped and bulbous. He pauses for a second and comments, “Now there’s somebody with something on their mind,” before twisting the balloons into the shape of an elephant.67 The balloon routine helped Boag get the job, but he admits that he promised Walt to clean up the act for the family-friendly Revue show. Fulton Burley makes a similar remark that he originally was unsure of how his own pre-Disneyland nightclub act would translate on the Revue stage.  Worth noting is that although some aspects of the vaudeville acts were altered for a younger crowd, the Slue-Foot Sue character—played by Betty Taylor—spends a significant portion of the show singing about love and flirting with boys and men of all ages in the audience. As with the earlier discussion of theme park employees and cast members, this retrospective on “The Golden Horseshoe Revue” shows how Disneyland employees had to adapt to fit the family-friendly image of the park. Both Boag and Burley acknowledge that their previous vaudeville acts were not suitable for their new audiences in Anaheim. Boag’s twist on the Freudian slip in particular demonstrates that                                                      67 “Disney Family Album: The Golden Horseshoe Revue,” The Disney Channel, original air date July 14, 1985. https://archive.org/details/disney-family-album-14-the-golden-horseshoe-revue. 217  some of the more salacious material cut from these performers’ original acts were suffused with homoerotic sexual innuendo. Vaudeville entertainment has deep roots in queer history, with its flamboyance, sexual overtones, and elements of gender play.68 The fact that vaudeville acts found success in the park from its earliest days up to the present speaks to the ability of entertainment practices rooted in arguably queer gender performances to fit heteronormative molds even as they pushed the boundaries of acceptable public displays of gender and sexuality in the family-friendly theme park. These vaudeville acts and other instances of performers and employees injecting eccentricity into Disneyland’s attractions and landscape speak to a compelling—if more theoretical—interconnectedness between theme parks and queerness more broadly. Many writers have drawn connections to the camp performances and aesthetics of Disneyland and other theme parks and queer individuals, communities, and histories, but even the games, rides, and other attractions evoke queer possibilities.69 Disneyland’s “Date Nite” events, as well as its jingles and advertisements depicting or singing about couples riding rides together discussed in chapter two invites a degree of queering the ride experience, despite the fact that all images and verbiage associated with these elements of the park are limited to heterosexual couplings. These songs, images, and other appeals for heterosexual couples to experience the park’s many attractions hand-in-hand speak to a romanticism and eroticism underlying the theme park experience as a whole. Even the                                                      68 For a unique take on vaudeville’s connections to queer culture, see Colin R. Johnson, “Camp Life: The Queer History of ‘Manhood’ in the Civilian Conservation Corps,” Just Queer Folks, pg. 129-157. 69 For an in-depth discussion of Disney and camp, see Sean Griffin, “Princess or Evil Queen? Camping Gender Identity in Disney,” in Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out, pg. 67-77. 218  term “thrill” in and of itself often evokes some kind of erotic pleasure. As such, experiencing a collective thrill with a group of strangers can be an erotic, and consequently queer experience in the context of the otherwise heteronormative, family-friendly theme park. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the 1978 “Gay Nite” party was a landmark event not only for the Orange County LGBTQ community, but for the broader national community, as well. As such, its legacy from day one onward has been contested, and retellings of that single event show a range of intentions. Scott Forbes and Carol Taylor-DiPietro, the two primary organizers, published one version of the event, but reports from attendees and other sources contradict or add nuance to their official account. Some anecdotes of the party maintain that the event was more raucous than Forbes and DiPietro’s version of the story. In the summary for the National Register of Historic Places, Forbes concludes that, “The fact that we did a ‘gay night’ at all and that it came off without problems speaks for itself. It’s great P.R.—showing them that we’re not all a bunch of screamers.”70 In Sean Griffin’s account of the night—compiled from oral histories with attendees and employees, as well as from the pages of David Koenig’s Mouse Tales—he states that the event goers were “joyfully engaging in what has been described by many of the people who worked at the park that night as a free-form orgy.”71 The Historic Places summary also states that there were no arrests made that night, but an article from the June twenty-second, 1978 Bay Area Reporter claims that there were a handful of arrests during the event, though park officials clarified that it was                                                      70 Forbes quotes in National Register of Historic Places application, pg. 55. 71 Griffin, pg. 127. 219  “not unusual to have some arrests at such a large gathering.”72 One of the event’s attendees commented on a 2010 blog post that the park tried its best to maintain the rowdy crowd by turning off music and lights in certain areas of the park, but guests “kept on ‘dancing’ throughout the park.73 The attendee also claims that, “Poppers were passed up and down the line of people waiting to board Space Mountain.”74 When the inaugural “Gay Nite” came up again in the press during the 1984 Andrew Ross Exler case, Forbes assured readers that “There was no dancing of same-sex couples.”75 In line with Disney’s tendency toward discretion, there are not many sources from the company commenting on the event. The article from the Bay Area Reporter includes a statement from Robert Roth, the public relations director for the park at the time. Roth states that despite the politically conservative status of the corporation, “the park is not political,” and therefore did not actively discriminate against applicants for private events.76 Disney’s desire to avoid publicity about the event is understandable inasmuch as the park rarely advertised private events. What is more complex, though, is how the two current histories about the event from Griffin’s text and other sources and from the application for the National Register of Historic Places contradict one another in simple, yet impactful ways.                                                       72 Disneyland: ‘No Comment On Future Gay Event,’” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 8, No. 13, June 22nd, 1978, pg. 16. 73 Quoted from Joey Terrill’s comment on “Family Fun Night at Disneyland,” on the Vintage Disneyland Tickets blog, October 16, 2020. http://vintagedisneylandtickets.blogspot.com/2010/05/family-fun-night-at-disneyland-may-25.html?showComment=1602877170819#c6671274519299049660. 74 Terrill.  75 “Disneyland gay dance ban challenged,” The Evening Press, Binghamton, New York, May 17, 1984, pg. 4A. 76 “Disneyland: ‘No Comment On Future Gay Event,’” pg. 16. 220  The story cobbled together from oral histories in previous monographs; from comment sections in rogue blog posts scatted throughout cyberspace; and from periodicals outside the watchful eye of event organizers is far more salacious than the official account in the bid for Historic Preservation and even the article in New West. The latter narratives depicted the event as surprisingly mundane, aside from the fact that having out and proud LGBTQ individuals in Disneyland—even for a private event—was unprecedented. As covered in the introduction, these narratives deliberately sought to depict LGBTQ individuals as unextraordinary theme park goers and as civil members of heteronormative society. The location of jokes about blowjobs and poppers, however, highlights the tension between organizers’ desire to mitigate overt references to or displays of sex and the eagerness of other LGBTQ people to be candid about queer sex. Whether or not sex—oral, orgies, or otherwise—was actually happening at the event is up for debate, but the willingness of some outlets to cover these rumors while they were being downplayed by the event organizers themselves speaks to more common tensions between LGTBQ activists and members of the community that persist to the present.   The overall success of the first “Gay Night” at Disneyland—in terms of both attendance and reception to the event—indicated that there was a desire for such celebrations at Disneyland and other theme parks. As such, organizers of the inaugural event as well as members from other community organizations would go on to plan annual “Gay Night” parties at Disneyland and other California theme parks alongside other planned daytime visits throughout the remainder of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. There were murmurings in the aftermath of the 1978 event that Disneyland would work to prevent another such event from occurring in the park, but the following year’s “Gay 221  Night” event was just as successful as the first.77 By 1979, organizers were hosting similar events at Magic Mountain and Great America amusement parks.78 Park officials parroted many of the same talking points when responding to questions about future “Gay Night” events in the late-1970s and early-1980s. John Poimiroo, who was the Public Affairs Director of Great America, commented that the park’s inaugural “Gay Night” “was a great success and this crowd was just as contained as any other group we have had.”79 An unnamed official from Magic Mountain argued that its own “Gay Night” was “no different than having the Mormons” in the park.80 The official response from Disneyland and its neighbors in California seemed to be that “Gay Night” events were just as welcome as any other private, after-hours celebration in their parks. While the inaugural “Gay Night” took a more clandestine approach to inserting gays and lesbians into the park, Andrew Exler’s case explored in the introduction represented a concerted, direct challenge to park policies against LGBTQ individuals. As discussed earlier, Exler and Shawn Elliot went to the Tomorrowland Terrace with the expressed purpose of challenging Disneyland’s official park policy against men dancing with men and women dancing with women. After being ejected from the park, the two hired attorney Ronald Talmo and took the issue to court. Judge John K. Trotter of the Orange County Superior Court ruled against Exler in the original case, and so did the                                                      77 “Disneyland Says NO to Gay Night,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 9, No. 2, January 18, 1979, pg. 10. 78 “’Gay Night’ Draws 15,000 Fun Park Revelers,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 9, No. 10, May 10, 1979, pg. 25. 79 “’Gay Night’ Draws 15,000 Fun Park Revelers,” pg. 25. 80 “Disneyland Says NO to Gay Night,” pg. 10. 222  California Fourth District Court of Appeal in 1981.81 Finally, in 1984, Orange County Superior Court Judge James R. Ross ruled in favor of Exler and Elliot and against Disneyland. But Exler and Elliot’s legal victory did not spell the end of Disneyland’s efforts to keep “same-sex” dancing from their parks’ dance floors. Moments after the decision was announced, Disneyland’s trial lawyer, William M. Bitting, commented that the park would “abide by the order, but it doesn’t apply to others. If two (other) men show up tomorrow night to dance, Disneyland won’t let them on the dance floor.”82 As it turned out, the court’s decision left just as many questions as answers, and it left a few potential grey areas and loopholes in its language. LGBTQ press outlets reported that the victory exclusively insured that Exler and Elliot could fast-dance together at the Tomorrowland Terrace only, and that “no other same sex couples may do so in the park.”83 Even in 1985, there seemed to be some lingering confusion over the specifics of the policy and its application. That year, the park opened its new dance club, “Videopolis,” in a renewed effort to attract teens and young adults into the park. Within a month of its opening, patrons of the new dance club pressed park officials to change their policy “against same-sex dancing” at that attraction. According to Disneyland spokesperson Al Flores, the park acquiesced and began allowing boys and girls to dance in pairs of their choosing. Flores stated that “we see a lot of situations where two girls come together and want to dance and ask to. We have always said no, but we changed                                                      81 “Court Upholds Disneyland on Homosexual Dancing Issue,” Jerry Hicks, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, October 21, 1981, pg. 9. 82 “Disneyland Drops Policy Prohibiting Same-Sex Dancing,” Maria L.

The narrowness of the original legal battle and the “Videopolis” decision came to bear on a group of gay and lesbian park goers in 1987, when security guards allegedly prevented members of their group from slow dancing together. Three members in particular, Christopher Drake, Eric Hubert, and Jeffrey Stabile, filed a lawsuit afterward in early-1988, claiming that the security guards were violating their civil rights as previously established in the Exler case.85 They claimed that the security guard told them that “‘touch’ dancing is reserved for heterosexual couples only,” and they charged the guard and Disneyland with discrimination.86 By mid-1989, though, the trio dropped the lawsuit and released a short statement through their lawyer, Leroy S. Walker, stating, “Disneyland reaffirms that its written policy prohibits discrimination based upon sexual orientation.” The court case came and went without ever going to trial, and the result was a simple verbal agreement that Disneyland would no longer “discriminate based on sexual orientation,” which seemed to be enough for all parties involved.87 In September of that year, Exler and a cohort of some fifteen other gay men tested the decision by “fast” and “slow” dancing together at “Videopolis.” Exler stated that the group was approached by a security guard once during the night, “‘But he just asked if we were                                                      84 “Disneyland Drops Policy Prohibiting Same-Sex Dancing,” pg. 5. 85 “Fairies can’t dance in the Magic Kingdom,” Gay Community News, Vol. 15, No. 40, pg. 2. 86 “Gays, Disneyland Settle Discrimination Suit,” Mary Lou Fulton, The Los Angeles Times, September 30, 1989, pg. R3. 87 “Gays, Disneyland Settle Discrimination Suit,” pg. R3. 224  having any problems with any of the other guests.’”88 For Exler, and indeed for many reading his reflections on his and the trio’s legal battles, this marked the end of the Disneyland dancing discrimination debacle.   Naturally, though, park officials denied that the policy targeted LGBTQ individuals in the first place. Bob Roth, spokesperson for the Disneyland park, assured LGBTQ presses that the park’s “policy requiring that dancing partners be male and female” had “nothing to do with Gays.”89 As discussed in chapter two, park policy seemed to be to remind anyone that would listen that the dancing restrictions were first and foremost a crowd control measure. In December of 1987, the very same year the park forbade visitors from “same-sex touch dancing,” the park played host to a private fundraising party for AIDS Project Los Angeles. John Voland of the Los Angeles Times was quick to frame the event as a concerted effort from Disneyland to “soothe hurt feelings,” claiming that he was surprised that the “group was not put off by the park’s prior antipathy toward gays congregating there.”90 Even the headline for the article, “Disneyland Makes Up to Gays With AIDS Fund-Raiser,” signaled his intent to spin the event as an attempt at reconciliation from the park. Andy Weiser of the AIDS Project Los Angeles noted that he and the other members of the APLA “were surprised how excited” the park “seemed about getting” their event together, suggesting that members of the community were perhaps still anticipating some push-back from Disneyland. Bob Roth                                                      88 “Dancing at Disneyland: Gay Who Challenged Dance Policy Returns to ‘Magic Kingdom,’” Keith Clark, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 19, No. 39, September 1989, pg. 2. 89 Bob Roth quoted in “Disneyland Officials Revert to the Old Two-Step, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 10, No. 21, October 9, 1980, pg. 21. 90 “Disneyland Makes Up to Gays With AIDS Fund-Raiser,” John Voland, The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, December 12, 1987, pg. 4. 225  said of the event, “We don’t see any controversy about this because we want to make a positive statement about AIDS care and also dismiss finally all the nonsense that’s happened in the past.”91 His comments about the AIDS Project Los Angeles fundraiser made characteristically vague references to the incident at Videopolis month’s prior. His statement about “all the nonsense” is deliberately imprecise. It acknowledges that something happened that might or might not have had to do with members of the same community as those anticipated for the APLA fundraiser, but it downplays the severity of the event and simultaneously deflects any blame away from the park.  Interestingly enough, Roth reappeared in the aftermath of the 1988 lawsuit against Disneyland to speak on behalf of the park. In 1989, Roth contended that “Same-sex dancing, whether fast or slow dancing, is just no longer a problem here,” and that “If there was a problem before, there’s not one now.”92 As with his above comments on the issue, these two remarks contradict one another, acknowledging that there was a problem in one and then questioning whether there were ever any issues in the latter. While Roth’s revised statement in the aftermath of the 1988 lawsuit can be seen as a sort of walking-back from his original position following the Exler case, his remarks demonstrate a typical rhetorical tactic that Disneyland spokespeople used when addressing various LGBTQ-related controversies in the park. Rather than outright acknowledging or denying any accusations of discrimination in the park, officials did both in equal measure,                                                      91 “Disneyland Makes Up to Gays With AIDS Fund-Raiser.” 92 “Dancing at Disneyland: Gay Who Challenged Dance Policy Returns to ‘Magic Kingdom,’” pg. 2. 226  apologizing for any perceived slights against the LGBTQ community while simultaneously denying that anything of the sort was possible in their theme park.  The protracted battle to challenge the park’s stance on same-sex dancing parallels many other similar contests from LGBTQ individuals to claim space throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. It also highlights the occasional disconnect between official park and corporate policies and the attitudes of those individuals chosen to enforce them. For example, while celebrating the ten year anniversary of Exler’s initial challenge, dancers at the Tomorrowland Terrace allegedly overheard a park security guard say, “‘I WISH THEY WOULD ALL DIE OF AIDS.’”93 In an ensuing letter of complaint, Vernon Mitchell, who was in attendance that night, stated that he brought the issue to the attention of senior staff members on location, but they were dismissive, “indifferent, and when they were not laughing, they had smirks on their faces.” Jack Lindquist, then president of Disneyland, responded to Mitchell’s letter, wherein he states that, “I have to conclude, and I think fairly so, that perceptions can differ and that no DISNEYLAND Cast Member was responsible for what your informant heard or thought he heard at the September 15 gathering.”94 Exler’s case and the subsequent lawsuits challenging Disneyland’s dancing policies also raised questions—both outside the community and within—about the efficacy of the whole endeavor. Some argued that the cases “guaranteed Gays and Lesbians equality at ‘The Happiest Place on Earth.’”95 Prolific Los Angeles gay activist                                                      93 Letter sent to Michael Eisner from Vernon Mitchell published in, “The happiest place on earth, indeed!” Gay Community News, Vol. 18, No. 18, pg. 4.  94 Response letter published in, “The happiest place on earth, indeed!” pg. 5. 95 Mitchell, pg. 4.  227  Morris Kight called the legal victories “‘…a giant step for gaykind.’”96 Others outside of Southern California stated that they “felt supportive of and supported by his challenge to Disneyland’s discriminatory policies about same sex dancing.”97 But, as Exler himself admits in a 1989 retrospective, many opponents saw his efforts and those that followed in his footsteps as “silly.” He claims that detractors contend that people “should only be ‘gay’ at gay businesses,” and that “gays dancing at Disneyland is not ‘appropriate,’ especially because of the ‘family atmosphere.’”98 As early as 1981, Exler was published op-eds in LGTBQ periodicals to express his discontent at the overall reaction from the LGBTQ community at his form of activism. He stated in a 1981 article in the Gay Community News that, “Some would think that the gay and lesbian community would be supportive of my battle for human rights,” but that they were instead “extremely critical and upset with [his] openness.” He further laments that he “was so naïve as to think that there existed, a gay liberation movement in California.”99 The conversations in LGBTQ publications surrounding the contests over Disneyland’s same-sex dancing ban were reminiscent of those that came in the wake of the inaugural “Gay Nite.” In his 1991 retrospective, for example, Exler mentions that maintaining good will between the park and the LGBTQ community “is certainly a two-way street.” He continues, stating that “If Disney treats homosexuals and persons with                                                      96 Quoted in “Gay dancing at Disneyland,” Andrew Exler, Gay Community News, Vol. 17, No. 18, November 1989, pg. 5. 97 “take a vacation!” Janine Baer, Gay Community News, Vol. 9, No. 17, November 1981, pg. 4. 98 Exler, Gay Community News, pg. 5. 99 “queers vs. disneyland,” Andrew Exler, Gay Community News, Vol. 9, No. 13, October, 1981, pg. 4. 228  AIDS with dignity and respect, they will be rewarded by our community when we patronize their businesses.” Just as Alan Cartnal of New West lauded the purchasing power of the LGBTQ community in his article on the 1978 “Gay Nite,” so, too, did Exler wish to remind Disney that the community was “gentle, loving, and economical.”100 This rhetoric was a product of the gay rights movements throughout the nation from the 1980s onward, and in some ways of earlier homophile activists on the 1950s onward. These comments served to convince corporations and lay readers that the LGBTQ community was a lucrative consumer market. By aligning themselves with middle-class values of consumerism specifically, these activists reinforced problematic associations between respectable gays and lesbians and money. Framing the act of consumption as activism worked to limit those who could participate as well as limit those for whom these activists were mobilizing.  Critiques from within the community regarding the methods and messaging behind both the legal battles over dancing and “Gay Night” events in Disneyland and other parks appeared to be few and far between. An article in the Bay Area Reporter from 1979 covering the inaugural “Gay Night” at Great American mentions that there were a handful of picketers in the parking lot with signs “No Money to the Oppressors,” but they did not seem to deter visitors to the event. At the time, Great America was partly owned by the Mormon Marriott family of Marriott Hotels, and protestors argued that to purchase a ticket to the event was to contribute to the continued oppression of LGBTQ people. The article concludes that “The controversy over Great America’s ownership did not seem to                                                      100 “Dancing With Disney,” Andrew Exler, Gay Community News, Vol. 19, No. 14, pg. 5. 229  materialize” outside of these few picketers.101 To complicate the issue further, members of the community took to the presses to debate “Gay Night” events. Charles Morris of The Sentinel spoke out against Great America’s inaugural “Gay Night,” echoing the argument above that celebrants were supporting the anti-gay Mormon Church by extension. Another article from the Bay Area Reporter covering the event struck back against Morris, maintaining that the event was a financial boon to community organizations like the Gay Community Services Center of Los Angeles and the Lamda Association of San Jose. In their opinion, the money raised for local LGBTQ organizations offset the costs of potentially supporting the anti-gay Mormon Church. The Bay Area Reporter article further argued that, at the time, Great America had not “had one case of discrimination filed against it on the basis of sexual orientation.”102 To hammer home their point, the article cited Pat Compano, who worked for the corporation as their costume designer, and was “convinced that Marriott does not discriminate against Gay people.”103 The community seemed divided on whether or not these “Gay Night” type events were worth the cost of admission, so-to-speak. On the one hand, they were consistently well-attended fundraising events for the local LGBTQ community. In the late-1980s and early-1990s, for example, “Gay Nights” at Disneyland proved to be a valuable                                                      101 “’Gay Night’ Draws 15,000 Fun Park Revelers,” pg. 25. 102 “Great America ‘Night’ Sales Are Brisk,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 9, No. 9, April 26, 1979, pg. 11. 103 “Great American ‘Night’ Sales Are Brisk,” pg. 11. 230  fundraising tool for Los Angeles area AIDS organizations.104 AIDS Project Los Angeles had also held a handful of private parties beginning in 1984 that doubled as vital fundraisers for the organization. This relationship between Disney and LGBTQ charitable work also extended to their other sites, like the Disneyland Hotel, which hosted the annual benefit dinner for the Gay and Lesbian Community Center in the late-1980s. Similarly, The Queen Mary—a recent acquisition of Disney as of 1991—played host to events for Life Lobby, Stop Sheldon, and the Lesbian and Gay Rights Chapter of the Southern California American Civil Liberties Union.105 Richard Jennings of Hollywood Supports helped to co-host a number of “AIDS in the workplace seminars” for Disney’s features-animation division, as well.106 On the other hand, as argued above, organizing in and through theme parks like Disneyland often limited the scope and reach of those who could contribute as well as those who benefited from filtering funds raised through other local organizations.  Disneyland held the unique distinction of being the only theme park of its contemporaries with a dedicated LGBTQ employee advocacy group. The Lesbian and Gay United Employees group of Anaheim—or LEAGUE Anaheim—was an offshoot of LEAGUE Burbank, which formed in 1992 at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It was as early as 1993 that members of LEAGUE Burbank recognized the                                                      104 “Mr. Marcus,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 20, No. 47, November 22, 1990, pg. 58, “Health and Community,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 23, No. 49, December 9, 1993, pg. 13. 105 “Dancing with Disney,” Andrew Exler, Gay Community News, Vol. 19, No. 14, October 1991, pg. 5. 106 “Hollywood Movers and Shakers Move and Shake for NGLTF,” Karen Ocamb, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 22, No. 38, September 17, 1992, pg. 18. 231  need for a sister organization for Disneyland park employees, and by 1995, LEAGUE Anaheim members constituted an estimated 150 of the 200 total members of both LEAGUE chapters. By 1995, the organization had worked to secure employee benefits like healthcare and dental for the domestic partners of lesbian and gay cast members.107  A 1995 article from the Los Angeles Times by author Karen Newell Young outlines the brief history of the organizations, as well as a broad history of Disney’s relationship with the LGBTQ community. The article also features interviews with LEAGUE Anaheim members like Steve Valkenburg, Jon Patton, and Richard “Dick” Hitt. Valkenburg, co-founder of LEAGUE Anaheim, states in his interview that the Disneyland worker’s organization was “not ACT UP. We’re not trying to overthrow the company. We’re working with the company for positive change.”108 Later in the article, Valkenburg doubles down on his position and adds, “I think if you work against something, you come away with negative feelings on both sides and accomplish nothing. I want Disney to be the best place to work, not just the happiest place to visit.”109 Valkenburg’s sentiments here echo some of the broader discourses within LGBTQ activist organizations and communities in the early and mid-1990s. As with the earlier investigation of the 1997 “Two Dads, Two Moms Gay Family Day Out at Six Flags,” Valkenburg and members of LEAGUE Anaheim sought to advocate for lesbian and gay inclusion in corporate America. Brian Mellott and the organizers of the event at Six Flags                                                      107 Karen Newell Young, “A LEAGUE of Their Own: Disneyland Gay-Lesbian Group Has Influenced Significant Change at Park,” Los Angeles Times, October 12, 1995. https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-10-12-ls-56242-story.html 108 Quoted in Young, “A LEAGUE of Their Own.”  109 Young.  232  Over Texas worked from within the parameters of the homonormative family unit. And aside from visibility and acceptance broadly conceived, LEAGUE Anaheim’s most successful campaign—to secure spousal benefits for gay and lesbian domestic partners—relied on similar homonormative images and scripts.  Moreover, by contrasting LEAGUE Anaheim with the “radical gay rights group” ACT UP, Valkenburg drives a discursive wedge between the methods, goals, and rhetoric of the two organizations.110 As Tamra King of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation stated in another Los Angeles Times article from 1995, “Disney promotes itself as a family company. This is a family benefit for people who don’t have a legal right to get married.”111 For activists like King and the members of LEAGUE Anaheim, it was important to prove that lesbians and gays could fit comfortably within the family-friendly Disney brand, and they often aimed to do so by disparaging the methods and rhetoric of other organizations, especially those associated with less conciliatory approaches, like the street theater techniques of ACT UP in the 1990s. As was the case with reporting after the inaugural “Gay Nite” event LEAGUE Anaheim members chose to distance themselves from organizations and individuals that the broader public imagined as anti-family. And as with the rumors of sex at “Gay Nite,” whether or not LEAGUE Anaheim members earnestly believed that ACT UP and other organizations were detrimental to their cause was a nonfactor. The discursive power of these tactics                                                      110 Quote by Karen Newell Young. She states that ACT UP “marched, demonstrated and outed homosexuals in the name of AIDS awareness.”  111 Chris Woodyard and Don Lee, “Disney to Extend Health Benefits to Gay Partners,” Los Angeles Times, October 7, 1995, pg. A1, A30.   233  functioned regardless to demarcate between forms of protest and forms of being, rendering one acceptable and other harmful. Individual life stories and anecdotes from other Disneyland employees help to add more context and nuance to what it meant to work as an LGBTQ person in a family-friendly environment. Robert Jess Roth, who went on to become the director of Disney’s Beauty and the Beast on stage, worked at Disneyland as a member of its stage shows like Plane Crazy, Mickey’s Nutcracker, and Motor Car Madness. Reflecting on his time at the park, Roth states, “when I worked there, I was still out and open and comfortable, though I suppose that was a little bold of me in that environment.”112 Trevor Allen made his feelings toward his time at Disneyland known in his black box production of Character! Or Working for the Mouse, which played at the 1996 Fringe Festival in the Bay Area. In the play, Allen details his years as a costumed actor in the park, and it features “a hilarious world of fascist employers and insane tourists that amused Disney fans and foes alike.”113 Still, there were countless other unnamed gays and lesbians that undoubtedly worked in the park. One author responded to the Andrew Ross Exler incident by quipping, “Has anyone checked to see who’s inside the Minnie Mouse figure which was dancing down Main Street in the parade?”114 These comments reinforce cultural assumptions about labor and theme parks. Although, as chapters two and three outlined, theme parks like Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland had stringent hiring practices and                                                      112 Robert Jess Roth quoted in “You…beast!

As early as October of 1995, spokespeople like Rev. Louis P. Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition in Anaheim were declaring that, “Disney now supports anti-family values,” and that the company was “a secular, anti-family corporation.”116 In June of 1996, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to officially boycott the Walt Disney Company at their annual meeting in New Orleans. The comments from Sheldon and the ensuing boycott underscored that for those within the religious Right, pro-gay and anti-family were interchangeable. The rancor of these complaints from conservative and evangelical camps was met mostly with ridicule in both LGTBQ presses and the outside media. Elaine Showalter of The Guardian a piece that was equal parts wit and apathy in response to the Southern Baptists’ boycott. She jokes about the similarities between Bill Clinton and Michael Eisner—then CEO of the Disney Corporation—and their treatment in the press and disparages her contemporaries like Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail for maintaining that Disney was succumbing to “the anti-family brigade.” She contends that “there is a fuss over Mickey-gate” in the mid-1990s “precisely because Disney has long been a                                                      115 These comments also remind us that there are countless other queer perspectives and stories about theme parks that have yet to be unearthed. 116 Quoted from Woodyard and Lee, pg. A30. 235  symbol, even a synonym, of American family values.” By the end of the twentieth century, though, “Disney’s metamorphosis into a $4.7 billion multinational conglomerate with themeparks [sic] in Paris and Tokyo and a booming business in adult travel and entertainment,” was off-putting for more conservative audiences.117 Morgan Dooley of Mountain Home, Arkansas, wrote in to the Baxter Bulletin satirizing the uproar over Gay Day and other such controversies, arguing that “It is obviously time for Disneyland to install a ‘homosexual detector’ at the gates.”118 These debates illustrate that by the mid and late-1990s, those objecting to LGBTQ events in theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas were less vocal and less visible than one might expect given the historic connections between LGBTQ activism and anti-family discourses. Although protests against Disneyland’s Gay Day events were less prevalent than one might expect, these events remained hugely successful and important both for Orange County LGBTQ individuals and those across the nation. But, like Six Flags Over Texas, Disneyland also appeared in more intimate arenas of queer life throughout the latter-half of the twentieth century. The obituary for Michael “Mikey” Brennan mentions how he performed in the Disneyland parades.119 Greg Hannaford, likewise, worked for Disneyland in the 1970s, following in the footsteps of his late father, Charles Hannaford.120 Those who knew Robert “Bob” Coglianese spoke of his love for                                                      117 “The call of the Baptists: it’s all right to be happy—but not gay—at Disneyland,” Elaine Showalter, The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, New South Wales, June 29, 1996, pg. 22. 118 “Ousting the undesirables from Disneyland,” Morgan Dooley, Baxter Bulletin, Mountain Home, Arkansas, January 26, 1996, pg. 4. 119 “Obituaries,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 28, No. 13, March 26, 1998, pg. 26. 120 “Obituaries,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 23, No. 25, June 24, 1993, pg. 28. 236  Disneyland and the tide pools at San Gregorio.121 Friends of Sam Rankin poked fun at his “art of questionable taste” and his “vicious, meanly” competitive drive on the volleyball court, but they also remembered his “irrepressible love for Disneyland” and the Giants.122 Although he passed unexpectedly at the age of twenty-three, Rodney Allen Taylor’s loved ones were at least thankful that “he got to make a last visit to one of his favorite places, Disneyland” before his death.123 Although this chapter focuses primarily on highly publicized legal battles and celebratory LGBTQ community events, the totality of queer experiences in relation to Disneyland and other theme parks cannot be captured by these stories alone. Personal ads and obituaries are but two avenues through which queer individuals sought connections to or reminisced about theme parks in their own intimate lives and the lives of loved ones gone too soon.  CONCLUSION In a 2011 interview with OC Weekly, Eddie Shapiro, co-founder of Gay Days Anaheim, was asked whether or not he hoped that Disney would ever officially recognize and sanction a “gay day” event. Shapiro answered with a definitive “no”, and clarified his position by stating, “I don’t see Disney having a dance party with go-go boys. Do you?”124 His comment is a reminder that, to this day, no theme park has an official “gay day” event. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is undoubtedly due to the apathy of park officials, who see no cost benefit in endorsing such events or fear upsetting other                                                      121 “Obituaries,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 18, No. 6, February 11, 1988, pg. 18. 122 “Obituaries,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 22, No. 47, November 19, 1992, pg. 22. 123 “Obituaries,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 23, No. 17, April 29, 1993, pg. 26. 124 “Q&A: Gay Days Anaheim Co-Founder/Event Producer Eddie Shapiro,” OC Weekly, September 22, 2011. https://www.ocweekly.com/qanda-gay-days-anaheim-co-founder-event-producer-eddie-shapiro-6457122/. 237  potential guests. But Shapiro’s comment also speaks to a fundamental aspect of queer culture, both historically and in the contemporary moment. It highlights how queer individuals, communities, and organizations often relish in forming counter-publics, or in creating sub-altern spaces within spaces.125 In the case of Gay Days Anaheim, Shapiro recognizes that pool parties packed from edge to edge with men in speedos might not fit comfortably on an events calendar for the family-friendly park. This chapter has illustrated a number of ways in which LGBTQ individuals, communities, and organizations have worked to create these spaces within spaces; to reinterpret the themes, images, and narratives of theme parks; and to find a sense of self from within deeply heteronormative landscapes. It also presented the ways in which those impulses to push for inclusion in heteronormative consumerist spaces have been met with challenges from both the outside world and, most importantly, from within the community itself. These critiques are a valuable reminder that theme parks were and continue to be prohibitive spaces. From the location of early theme parks far and away from accessible urban centers; to the cost of entry; to the necessity to take time off from work to travel and enjoy these leisure spaces, theme parks like Disneyland and even the more budget friendly Six Flags Over Texas were effectively closed off from certain classes of Americans. These parks also celebrated histories and themes of white colonialism, nationalism, militaristic and occasionally even religious conquest. To claim space in these parks was, in a way, to align with these histories and narratives. Still, as the back-page advertisements seeking park companions and the obituaries celebrating a                                                      125 For more on counter-publics, see Lauren Berlant and Michael Warner, “Sex in Public,” Critical Inquiry, Vol. 24, No. 2, Winter 1998, pg. 558-64. 238  person’s love for theme parks tell us, it is good to remember that, for some queer folks, theme parks were simply a source of great joy. Whether or not Disneyland or Six Flags Over Texas are, were, or ever will be “surely the queerest place on Earth” is debatable, but regardless, maybe it is best to end on that somewhat happy note.126                                                      126 “The View From Homo Row,” Rachel Pepper, Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 22, No. 23, June 4, 1992, pg. 10. POSTSCRIPT: Following the late-February, 2022 uncovering of Disney’s financial contributions to the campaigns of the authors of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” legislation, I regrettably have to issue a big fat NEVERMIND to this last sentiment vis-à-vis Disney specifically.  239  Epilogue: Too Dollyweird?   In 1999, BBC Worldwide released a short documentary on Dolly Parton’s theme park called “Dollywood or Bust.” The documentary follows British art historian Tim Marlow as he navigates his way through the park, interviewing employees and guests, riding the rides, feasting on southern cuisine, and sampling the wares of the artisan’s alley and various gift shops. Two years prior in 1997, filmmakers Jeanine Oleson and Danielle Sawicki submitted a short film also called “Dollywood or Bust” to the eleventh MIX NYC, an experimental gay and lesbian film and video festival. Despite the obvious differences in the intended audiences of each video, both iterations of “Dollywood or Bust” contain striking similarities in their treatment of the park as a shrine to Dolly Parton. Each video features a segment set in the park’s museum exhibit, “Rags to Riches: The Dolly Parton Story.” In the BBC version, Marlow describes the facets of the exhibit as the camera pans across the bustline of Parton’s outfits on display behind glass cases. Marlow talks about all the unique people Parton has met and quips, “They don’t even build mannequins like Dolly Parton.”1 In the MIX NYC version, the protagonist ogles Parton’s rhinestone neckline and places a hand longingly on the glass between her and the mannequin’s bust. For both visitors, no trip to the museum on the life of Dolly Parton is complete without an overt display of deference to her breasts.                                                       1 BBC Worldwide, “Dollywood or Bust,” 1999, 12:35-12:45, Academic Video Online Database, https://unr.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://www-proquest-com.unr.idm.oclc.org/audio-video-works/dollywood-bust/docview/1822671897/se-2?accountid=452. 240   The similarities in these two short films suggests that there is significant overlap between heterosexuals’ readings of Dolly Parton—the woman and the brand—and the status of the country-pop star in some queer cultural circles. It also hints at a point of tension between Parton’s reputation by the 1990s as a busty blonde bombshell and as the owner of and inspiration behind a family-friendly theme park. In April of 1998, Dolly Parton appeared on The Rosie O’Donnell Show to promote two new attractions for the thirteenth season at Dollywood. The first, Paradise Road, was a standard theme park singing and dancing show featuring Parton’s greatest hits and a semi-biographical narrative. The second new attraction was Daredevil Falls—a Hopkins Rides Super Flume that, at the time, was touted as the highest and fastest water ride in the country.2 During the interview, Parton explains that like many of the rides and attractions in the park, Daredevil Falls is loosely based off of her life and her family. She tells O’Donnell that the ride’s inclusion in the park was inspired by an old swimming hole that her and her siblings used to frequent. Local lore held that caves sat at the bottom of the lake that created a vortex that would suck kids who ventured too far from the shore down into the abyss. Because of these fabled whirlpools, the kids called the swimming hole “the old suck hole,” and so when contemplating the name of the attraction inspired by the suck                                                      2 From the official Dolly Parton website, “’Paradise Road: The Life and Songs of Dolly Parton,’” April 25th, 1998, https://dollyparton.com/family_destinations/dollywood/paradise-road-the-life-and-songs-of-dolly-parton/4629 241  hole story, Parton concedes that she “thought Daredevil Falls would look better on the brochures.”3   Parton’s interview on The Rosie O’Donnell Show encapsulates what made her so captivating, and what made a theme park based off of her life, family, and brand so intriguing. As the Daredevil Falls anecdote illustrates in particular, Parton continued to confound conventional boundaries. She was simultaneously wholesome and crude, with her family and personal life stories often hinging on a sexual punchline or some unsubtle reference to her most notorious assets. Her 1994 autobiography is similarly a fascinating mix of good Christian morality and sex positivity.4 The take-away for both her autobiography and her interviews like the one for The Rosie O’Donnell Show, then, is that while Parton embodied a host of contradictions for outside spectators, she rarely seemed like a conflicted character. It was that precise assurance in herself which made her so mesmerizing, but outsiders still had misgivings about a family-friendly theme park dedicated to the life of the ostentatious country star.5   At one point in the interview with O’Donnell as Parton is explaining the other attractions and shows the park offers, she turns to the camera and says the iconic park motto, “Come on down! It’s home-spun fun!”6 She laughs and the audience laughs alongside her. Most of the humor in the bit comes from the way Parton delivers the                                                      3 From The Rosie O’Donnell Show, Episode 2, April 2nd, 1998, https://archive.org/details/TheRosieODonnellShow19980402DollyPartonCamrynManheimEdwardBurns. 4 Dolly, Dolly Parton, Harper Collins, 1994. 5 A 1985 article from the Lexington Herald-Leader asserted that Dollywood “sound like a joke, but it’s serious,” from “If ‘Dollywood’ is dandy, wouldn’t ‘Lorettaland’ be lovely,” Jan 15th, 1985, pg. B3. 6 This motto was used during the first few years of the park’s operation in the 1980s.  242  moto—with a wink and a heavy drawl, earnestly in spite of how corny and contrived slogans for theme parks can be. But some of the humor undoubtedly lay in the irony that there was an entire family-friendly theme park based off of the somewhat vulgar Dolly Parton. By the 1990s, Parton was best known for her bustline and for interviews like the one above with its frequent use of sexual innuendo, but she was also still very much Appalachia’s daughter. She made headlines in equal part for her candid talk about her style and aesthetics and for her continued success in the contemporary country music scene—a genre with deep roots in white, heteronormative cultures.7  Journalist Robert K. Oermann, in an article from The Tennessean from 1986 reviewing a recent star-studded country music concert in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, recalls a moment when Parton exclaimed to the crowd: “Walt Disney may have Space Mountain, but I’ve got twin peaks!”8 These anecdotes demonstrate that from the earliest moments of the park’s operation to the tail end of the 1990s, Dolly Parton’s reputation was simultaneously that of the family-friendly “rags-to-riches daughter of Appalachia” and of a buxom blonde down-home hybrid of Mae West and Marilyn Monroe.9 The latter news story also demonstrates that, like Six Flags Over Texas, journalists compared the Dolly Parton-themed park to the Disney properties, which were still the gold standard in family fun during the 1980s. An article from the Los Angeles Times covering a 1985                                                      7 See Kate Heidemann, “Remarkable Women and Ordinary Gals: Performance of Identity in Songs by Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton,” in Country Boys and Redneck Women: New Essays in Gender and Country Music, University Press of Mississippi, 2016, pg. 166-88. 8 From “Kenny, Dolly and T. Graham dish up a tasty concert,” The Tennessean, Nov 3rd, 1986, pg. 32. 9 Quoted from “Parton opens park to overflow crowd,” The Tennessean, May 4th, 1986. Journalist Rita Kempley mentions many other comparisons in her article, “Dolly Parton, Going for Glitter,” in The Washington Post, Nov 17th, 1989, pg. D1.  243  groundbreaking of Dollywood described the park’s predecessor, Silver Dollar City, as a “1880s-themed mountain village” that featured “Disneyland-type amusement rides,” among other things.10 Another article published the day before the park’s opening declared that Parton was following “in the roller coaster tracks of such amusement park wizards as Walt Disney.”11  As her comment about Space Mountain and twin peaks indicated, even Parton herself recognized that entering into the theme park industry meant acknowledging the impact that Walt Disney had on the shape and character of all theme parks. In an interview with journalist Nanci Hellmich for the May third, 1986, cover story of The Hanford Sentinel, Parton stated: “I’ve always loved theme parks. I’ve always been intrigued with Disneyland. I’ve always thought of myself in a way as a female Walt Disney.”12 Although Parton does not comment on the specifics of her likeness to Walt Disney, the sheer volume of comparisons between the two cemented that everyone—from Parton herself to journalists to the everyday readers—expected Dollywood to be the next big thing in kid-friendly fun for the whole family. What puzzled readers and writers alike, then, was how Dollywood would achieve such a feat and reconcile some of Parton’s more mature sensibilities with the theme park’s broader obligation to be appropriate for children.                                                      10 Deborah Caulfield, “Dolly does Disney one better,” Los Angeles Times reprinted in The Gazette (Cedar Rapids, Iowa,) Oct 13th, 1985, pg. 85.  11 “The Best Little Theme Park in Tennessee,” Daily News (New York, New York), May 2nd, 1986, pg. 609.  12 “Parton’s Park: A Dream Come True,” The Hanford Sentinel (Hanford, California), May 3rd, 1986, pg. 32.  244  In terms of theming, Dollywood followed the blueprints of the parks before it, blending together elements of history, fantasy, regionality, and the family. Like Six Flags Over Texas, Dollywood emphasized and utilized regional history in its shows, attractions, rides, and décor. Dollywood kept or slightly remodeled most elements of the 1880s-mountain-town-themed Silver Dollar City, building upon that foundation and adding new sections to create “a recreation of the Smoky Mountain lore” that Parton “remember[ed] from her childhood.”13 Part of Parton’s desire to create “a rural theme park extolling the crafts and lifestyle of the Tennessee hills” was to provide a corrective to stereotypical representations of the Appalachian hillbilly.14 She mentioned in a 1985 interview with Associated Press writer Kristi Umbreit that: “It’s something I want to take pride in, to preserve the Smoky Mountain heritage rather than have Hollywood portray us as they often do.”15 Whatever her reasoning, Dollywood would continue to foreground a version of Tennessee history that, like Six Flags Over Texas and Disneyland, mingled fact and fantasy together and engaged families that visited the park throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Parton’s extended family frequently performed at the park as musicians and artisans and were a natural fit for Dollywood’s themes of personal history and family-oriented entertainment. One of Parton’s first major additions when she took over the park was the Parton Back Porch Theater in the Rivertown Junction section of the park. This                                                      13 Steve Baker, “Country’s Variety of Theme Parks Now Features One for Dolly Parton,” Schenectady Gazette, Jul 26th, 1986, pg. 15. 14 Alan Abbey, “Country Music Artists’ ‘Living Museums’ not necessarily Ego Trips,” The Tennessean, Oct 30th, 1985, pg. 13. 15 “Dolly Parton Pitches ‘Dollywood’ Park,” The Tennessean, Jul 23rd, 1985, pg. 33.  245  amphitheater used the back porch of the model recreation of Parton’s childhood home as its stage where stories allege that only Parton’s family and friends could perform.16 The replica home itself was also a major centerpiece in the park’s early years. Parton’s personal family history also inspired the theming and name for the restaurant Aunt Granny’s Dixie Fixins, which served typical southern fare like fried chicken and cornbread.17 Dollywood was heralded as both a celebration of particular Appalachia culture and a joy for the whole family, despite the fact that Parton herself, as illustrated above, had a somewhat paradoxically wholesome and tawdry image in the broader public during the time. Unsurprisingly, given her status as a queer cultural icon as early as the mid-1980s, many LGBTQ individuals and communities across the South envisioned Dollywood as as much a space for them as it was a space for their heterosexual counterparts. Following the popularization of Gay Days and other events in theme parks like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas in the 1990s, LGBTQ activists and community members in southern states began contemplating hosting a similar event at Dollywood. In August of 1996, Steve Warren published an article in an LGBTQ periodical from Raleigh, North Carolina, The Front Page, where describes his vision for a “gay day” at the Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Warren states that given that the nearby Disney World hosted an annual “gay day”, there was already a blueprint for a similar celebration in Dollywood. In the article, he outlines why Dollywood would                                                      16 Gerald Martin makes this claim in his article “Homespun Hospitality,” The News and Observer (Raleigh, North Carolina), Aug 4th, 1991, pg. 117. 17 Vernon Scott of the UPI Hollywood Reporter, “Dolly Parton has Big Plans for Theme Park,” The Daily News-Journal (Murfressboro, Tennessee), Mar 9th, 1986, pg. 70.  246  make an ideal spot for a “gay day”, noting how Dolly Parton herself was “a good friend to the gay and lesbian community and at least a semi-icon” in their “pantheon of divas.”18 According to Warren, park officials stated that while Dollywood would not establish an official sponsored “gay day,” they similarly would not deny the group’s right to visit their theme park. Warren’s article, focuses on the various aspects of Dollywood that make it queer friendly, from the flaming queens who operated rides and performed at the park’s many shows and attractions to the drag queen-esque celebrity impersonators working in the Silver Screen Café.19 His assessment of Dollywood reveals that although the theme park would not have a “gay day” event of similar size and scale to Six Flags Over Texas or Disneyland until 2002, Dollywood was a space of queer possibilities well before the twenty-first century. Given that Dollywood thematically serves as both a museum to the life of Dolly Parton and an interactive preservation site for old Smoky Mountain lifeways, it is useful to investigate the ways in which queer individuals and communities imagined and discussed Parton and the broader rural South throughout the late-twentieth century. Parton’s presence in the LGBTQ community can be traced back to the mid-1970s, when she started to gain traction as a solo recording artist thanks in large part to her chart-topping single, “Jolene.” By 1974, newspapers and other media sources were also taking notice of Parton’s particular image and aesthetic. Tom Tide of the Newspaper Enterprise Association published an article on the Grand Ole Opry in January of 1974 describing the typical nightly show. In one segment, a performer allegedly shouts, “Wait                                                      18 Steven Warren, “Too Dollyweird?” The Front Page, August 2, 1996, pg. 31. 19 Warren, pg. 31. 247  till you see Dolly Parton. Ooooeeee! She has the biggest upstairs pillows in the entire state.”20 Although Parton was not synonymous with her bust just yet, she was already cultivating her iconic aesthetic during the mid-1970s that would make her an LGBTQ cultural icon by the 1980s. In a 1975 article for the New York Times News Service, John Rockwell writes that “the most striking thing about Miss Parton is her looks, exaggerated even by country standards.”21 He adds that Parton “has a remarkable hour-glass figure and an array of hair, make-up and jewelry that suggests kabuki drama more than real life.”22 By 1976, newspapers were interviewing stylists that had worked with Parton previously and were publishing articles on how to achieve the signature Parton look with “cascades of blond hair…’sexy’ costumes and makeup.”23 And in 1977, fans could purchase a Dolly Parton toy doll with “gaudy finery” like “a scarlet gypsy outfit with matching bandana and a shocking pink, skintight jumpsuit.”24 These articles and comments from the mid-1970s signal the particulars of Parton’s developing visual brand which would become staples of every drag artist impersonating the country music songstress, from her dramatic hair and makeup to her garish costumes and quintessential hourglass body shape. Parton’s exaggerated feminine features were markedly similar to the kinds of hyperbolic gendered performances that characterized drag queen entertainers. During the question-and-answer segment toward                                                      20 Tom Tide, “Howdy! The Grand Ole Opry is on the air—still,” Martinsville Daily Reporter, January 1, 1974, pg. 10. 21 John Rockwell, “Dolly Parton Hits Are Pure Country,” Fort Lauderdale News, August 8, 1975, pg. 58D. 22 Rockwell, pg. 58D.  23 Ann Landers Bridge, “Only Dolly’s hair not real,” Fort Worth Star-Telegram, April 9, 1976, pg. 1b. 24 “Noteworthy: Dolly doll,” The Record, October 14, 1977, pg. A2. 248  the end of the 1987 pilot episode of her variety show, an audience member asks if Parton ever wished she was born a man, to which Parton replies, “Lord no. I’ve always been a sissy, and if I’d have been born a man I’d have been a drag queen, ‘cuz I love to primp!”25 Her answer acknowledges her own penchant for big hair, big makeup, and exaggerated feminine features, but it also alludes to the fact that she was a frequent subject of drag performances a gay male subcultures since the late-1970s. Parton even claims to have entered and lost a Dolly Parton look-alike contest at some point in her life.26  But Parton figured into LGBTQ cultural and social sites in other ways from the 1970s onward. Lynn Bahlman published an essay titled “Game Ladies: One Night in the Life of a Lesbian in New York” for the September 1977 issue of Christopher Street which details, as the title suggests, a typical night out on the town for the author. She describes a brief encounter with a sex worker at an unnamed disco club who she refers to as “Dolly”. She mentions that “Dolly” wore “a Dolly Parton wig” and could rest “her tits on her knees for support.”27 Whether Bahlman gave the sex worker her pseudonym because of the wig or her sizable breasts—likely both—is unclear, but regardless, the anecdote reveals how certain aesthetic characteristics were affiliated with Parton in late-1970s lesbian culture as well as drag performances primarily associated with gay male subcultures. Parton’s singles and records also found spins in various LGBTQ spaces                                                      25 Dolly variety TV show, “Pilot”, September 27, 1987, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWChySnR76M. 26 Dolly Parton addresses the rumor a handful of times throughout her many interviews. See for example her 2009 interview with Robin Roberts of Good Morning America.  27 Lynn Bahlman, “Game Ladies: One Night in the Life of a Lesbian in New York,” Christopher Street, September 1977, pg. 45. 249  throughout the mid and late-1970s. Discos and discotheques across the United States and Europe played Parton’s 1978 hit “Baby I’m Burnin’,” which fused pop and country with a splash of disco influence.28 Parton also received plenty of attention for her musical prowess throughout this era in LGBTQ periodicals alongside her fellow Nashville country music colleague, Loretta Lynn.29 But Parton’s image in the LGBTQ community of the mid and late-1970s and early-1980s was not a singular one of imitation-worthy glamor and aesthetics and celebratory country-pop hits. In “Sapphires & Diamonds,” a music review piece for Gay News in 1977, London journalist Jean-Claude Thévenin argued that Parton epitomized “the Nashville lady-singer, all platinum blond hair, rhinestones and good, old-fashioned (i.e. rigidly heterosexual) ‘country’ standards.”30 Although he admits that her most recent album had the potential to take her in a new direction, Thévenin’s remark about Parton showcases how some LGBTQ individuals still associated the country star with conventional heterosexuality, despite her highly stylized gendered performance. Another article from Paul O’M Welles published in GPU News in 1980 reviewing recent book releases comments that “Trade paperback is to mass paperback as Hepburn is to Dolly                                                      28 The song frequented Dick’s Inn Gay Discotheque’s top 10 songs of the week throughout late-1978 and early-1979, among other clubs. See for example the top 10 list in Gay News (London), February 22-March 7, 1979, Sexual Politics in Britain Collection, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 29 See for example Eileen Willenborg’s “Country Music—Stand By Yourself,” Blazing Star, Vol. 5, No. 3, May 1979, pg. 4-6, LGBTQ Newspapers and Periodicals Collection from the Lesbian Herstory Archives, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 30 Jean-Claude Thévenin, “Sapphires & Diamonds,” Gay News (London), April 7-20, 1977, Sexual Politics in Britain Collection, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 250  Parton, a matter of class.”31 Welles’s dig at Parton reinforces that although some LGBTQ community members looked at Parton with reverence, many others saw her as a subject worthy of critique and even ridicule.   The lesbian short film “Dollywood or Bust” discussed at the beginning of this chapter highlights how Parton continued to appear in lesbian media in particular throughout the late-twentieth century. In 1991, Jean Carlomusto showed her short film, “L Is For The Way You Look,” at various lesbian and gay and feminist film festivals. The film’s summary states that it is a “fun-filled exploration of lesbian history and the women who have served as role models and objects of desire for young lesbians.”32 During the film, the protagonists catch wind that Parton was spotted at a club on New York’s Lower East Side for a lesbian stand-up night, and they work to separate fact from fiction.33 The short film built upon both the broader rumors surrounding Parton’s sexuality as well as the erotic appeal she had maintained within many lesbian communities up through the 1990s. Liz Galst jokingly predicted in a Q&A from Gay Community News with readers that Parton would come out of the closet on the Johnny Carson show.34 What these articles underscore is how Parton’s sexuality was a frequent                                                      31 Paul O’M. Welles, “Reading Writing,” GPU News (Milwaukee, WI), Vol. 9, No. 7, pg. 16, Lesbian Herstory Archives Newsletter Collection, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 32 Quoted from film summary in an undated press release for Women Make Movies, Lesbian Herstory Archives Digital Collection, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 33 Other lesbian idols mentioned feature the likes of Simone de Beauvoir, Madonna, and Fran Lebowitz. 34 Quoted from “Queers for Years,” Gay Community News (Boston), Vol. 17, No. 24, pg. 8-9, LGBTQ Newspapers and Periodicals Collection from the Lesbian Herstory Archives, Gale Archives of Sexuality and Gender. 251  subject of queer discourse, whether it was in lusting after the buxom country star or speculating on her own queer performance and desires.     If Dolly Parton herself had a contested reputation in lesbian and gay subcultures, her theme park, Dollywood, was even more complicated in queer discourses. An article from the Bay Area Reporter in 1993 puzzles over what the author calls the “Gay Dollarist” method of activism. The author, Michael C. Botkin, argues against the efficacy of economic tactics like consumer boycotts and selective spending. In the article, the Botkin cites the failure of recent consumer boycott threats from religious groups against Hawaii—which was becoming a hotspot for gay honeymooners—and from gay activists in Ohio against the city of Cincinnati—which had just repealed a piece of gay rights legislation. He ridicules the former, in particular, stating that “their masses of feeble-minded followers” would have to “make do with semi-annual pilgrimages to Dollywood and vacation Bible school.”35 This quick, classist jab at the average religious person equates Dolly Parton’s theme park with the Religious Right of the early-1990s. It illustrates that for some commentators, Dolly Parton and Dollywood were inextricably linked to conservative cultures and politics.   There was no one unified understanding of Dollywood—nor of Dolly Parton—within the queer cultural imaginary. For some, Dollywood was a space of queer potentiality that elicited images of drag queens and sex objects. But for many others, Dollywood was a distillation of Southern rural hostility toward LGBTQ people. On the                                                      35 Michael C. Botkin, “Queer Watch: Mythical Beasts,” Bay Area Reporter, Vol. 23, No. 45, Nov. 11, 1993, pg. 22. Botkin calls this method of queer activism “lavender capitalism,” adding to the list of colorful critiques of queer advocacy rooted in spending. 252  final day of the first annual East Tennessee Pride festival in 2003, attendees were encouraged to journey over to “perhaps the gayest place in the South, Dollywood!”36 This comment parallels earlier conversations about Disneyland as the “Gayest place one Earth.” Both serve to reinforce the notion that for many LGBTQ observes, there was something fundamentally queer about theme parks. As discussed in chapter four, these observers may have been referencing the bevy of queer performers that brough characters like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny to life; or the many gay singing and dancing spectacles of The Golden Horseshoe and the like; or something more abstract like the queer experience of public thrill. Regardless, these claims reveal how theme parks cropped up in queer cultural discourses throughout the twentieth century. For some, they were sites of queer pleasure and potentialities, but for others, they were monuments to middle-class heteronormativity and capitalistic excess that were best to be avoided altogether. As this coda and this dissertation have shown, Gay Days and other LGBTQ events in theme parks are a fascinating nexus point through which we can view a host of other broader cultural and political histories in the twentieth century. They are histories of LGBTQ politics, communities, and identities which outline the ways in which activists claimed space in public consumer and leisure spaces. They are also cultural histories of the conservative politics and sentiments that LGBTQ activists were pushing back against from the 1970s onward, and that found expression in the theming and marketing of sites like Disneyland and Six Flags Over Texas. They are histories of the suburbs and rural                                                      36 “East Tennessee Pride gears up for first annual event in September,” Q-Notes (Charlotte), July 5, 2003, pg. 15. 253  towns the play host to these theme parks, as well as the residents and politicians that shaped their culture and economy from the 1950s on. They are histories of postwar consumer rights and politics. They are histories of the American child and the American family in all their plasticity. What these histories reveal is that although theme parks were semi-coherent sites of postwar heteronormativity, they were also sites of queer potentiality. Oftentimes, that queer potentiality was subsumed under the weight of respectability politics that played out in reports of “Gay Day” events and their predecessors. But these events were only the most visible intersections of theme parks and queer culture. There was and always will be a plethora of unseen, deeply personal, and deeply subversive ways in which LGBTQ people interact with theme parks, and still more ways in which theme parks themselves remain sites of queer possibilities for all.   254  Bibliography  Archer, John, Paul J.

    "abstract": "Scholars of theme parks and their histories recognize that a carefully crafted family-friendly environment is the cornerstone of the themed amusement landscape dating back to the 1950s. From marketing and promotional material; to in-park signage and ride narratives; to the themes of childlike wonder and family fun, theme parks have made the heterosexual nuclear family unit the prototypical park visitor. This project explores the histories and geographies of theme parks and their privileging of the heterosexual family unit through a queer framework. It focuses on Disneyland, and Six Flags Over Texas in latter half of the twentieth century, tracing the development of the two metropolitan regions alongside studies of suburban imaginaries. It demonstrates how reading theme park marketing material, ride narratives, and other aspects of the theme park landscape through a queer lens exposes the centrality of the heterosexual family. Using a queer lens also unearths moments of gender and sexual alterity in these materials. I argue that the heterosexual family unit was a mainstay of theme park marketing and theming throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s despite the increasing visibility and inclusion of LGBTQ-identified visitors, and despite the queer potentialities of the theme park landscape",
