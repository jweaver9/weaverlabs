The survey was particularly designed to reflect on their experiences and responses to on-line violence and censorship. In this introductory note, we comment on the meaning of the survey as a tool to explore the potential, challenges and pos-sibilities of the internet for the exercise of gender and sexuality rights.The EROTICS project looks at the impact of regu-latory frameworks and control mechanisms on the actual lived practices, experiences and concerns of internet users in the exercise of their sexual rights.2 At its seminal stage, five case studies showed that while increasing online activity exposes users to cer-tain risks and threats, individuals and collectives are successful in developing means of self-protection, regulation and empowerment.3 However, national governments, as well as business and user-based control initiatives aimed at curbing those risks – vaguely justified by the imperative of protecting vulnerable subjects – end up generating restrictions 1 Bruno Zilli (PhD) and Horacio Sívori (PhD) are anthropologists, researchers at the Latin American Center on Sexuality and Human Rights, State University of Rio de Janeiro; where Bruno is the assistant editor of Latin American Journal, and Horacio is an assistant professor at the Graduate Program in Collective Health.2 Kee, J. (Ed.). (2010). EROTICS: Sex, rights and the internet. Association for Progressive Communications. https://www.apc.org/en/node/127813 Ibid. The research was conducted in five countries: Brazil, India, Lebanon, South Africa and the United States.to online activity and content that could otherwise improve the thriving online experience and sexual expression of internet users, in particular, young people, women and sexual minorities. To assess the scope of this impact on sexual rights advocacy, the EROTICS team designed and applied a global survey with two primary objectives. One was to map how sexual rights activists (on a variety of issues and from different countries) use the internet to advance their work. The other objective was to document and provide insights on the types of risks, harassment, content regulation or censorship they deal with, and how they respond to them. That is, what gender and sexuality-related online content, practices and modes of interaction may be subjected to censorship, limitations, threats or violence.The survey reached out to respondents broadly self-identified as “working on” LGBTIQ, women’s and sexual rights, which potentially included activ-ists, scholars, experts and supporters; in other words, individuals who are particularly sensitive to issues around sexual rights and the internet. They were invited to respond to a questionnaire addressing is-sues of access, use of internet resources for advocacy, online safety and censorship. The first global survey was launched in 2013,4 and a slightly revised ver-sion of the questionnaire was applied as a follow-up exercise in 2014.5 In 2017, a revised version of the questionnaire was again sent out, and an impor-tant innovation was introduced: in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals who volunteered to expand on their responses.6Given the global scope of this research, the re-sults provide insights on the social, political and technical contexts of internet use by gender and 4 See https://www.genderit.org/articles/survey-sexual-activism-morality-and-internet5 Link to report of 2014 survey results.6 Link to report of 2017 survey results.Sexuality and the internet: 2017 survey findingsEROTICS Global Survey 20177sexuality activists worldwide, the security challenges they face, as well as current limitations to the exer-cise of sexual rights, and how they negotiate them. The findings illuminate the connections between internet surveillance, online sexual sociability and expression, and how gender and sexuality markers, among others, mediate the access and meaningful use of ICTs. They provide evidence to help explain the impact of internet regulation on sexual rights activists’ work, and make inferences about the exer-cise of gender and sexual rights in the contemporary online/offline continuum. Insights from the EROTICS survey might also help explore strategic ways for sexual rights activists to address digital security and advocate for gender and sexuality issues among in-ternet rights activists. The 2017 surveySampleThe basic demographics of the survey sample in-dicate some variety in terms of age, gender and sexual identity, reflecting the reach of this research initiative, initially targeted at the networks among which the EROTICS project has resonated, without a pre-designed sample stratification device. The survey provides valuable data on some particular lo-cal contexts, as well as age and sex/gender identity categories. Given the size of the sample, broader in-ferences with some statistical validity can be made, considering the survey’s characteristics and its tar-geted universe, gender/sexual rights activists, with certain countries, regions, age groups and sex/gen-der identities better represented than others.Active dissemination of the survey had an im-pact on the sample, evidently dominated by LGBTIQ and feminist activism, which is consistent with the survey target. In all its three applications, most sur-vey respondents were overall relatively young, cis queer female. World regions where EROTICS mem-bers are based or are more active – largely in the global South – were substantially better represent-ed, highlighting the importance of networking for the success of the survey.Matters of representationThe small number of responses obtained from indi-viduals who self-identified as transgender, intersex or “other” does not permit any statistically relevant state-ments regarding those groups. However, strategies to reach trans people have been progressively more successful, with an increase in their representation in the most recent survey. To complement the survey data, in 2017, interviews were conducted with trans persons, among others not as strongly represented in earlier survey samples – in particular, invisibilised or silenced communities, such as persons with disa-bilities, younger and elder age groups, and migrants. The 2017 report quotes those interviews, offering their important and illuminating perspectives. The report also presents the individual responses of trans and intersex people to the questionnaire in absolute numbers, instead of percentages, to account for their small statistical representation.Online presence Most respondents worked for non-governmental or-ganisations, followed by people who worked either as independent activists or are members of academ-ic or policy institutes, focusing on issues related to women’s and LGBTIQ rights, usually through policy monitoring, content production and/or dissemina-tion, and direct actions such as training and capacity building – all these activities relying heavily on in-ternet access. The survey sample shows that more cis heterosexual women work on women’s rights and more cis gay men work on LGBTIQ rights.The report also shows how important an online presence is for people who face strong social dis-crimination. They use the internet to express their identities, to network, to search for and share infor-mation, as well as to advocate for their rights. This enabling role of the internet is evident in the use of so-cial networks (especially Facebook), email (especially Gmail), and instant messaging (especially WhatsApp). Despite its importance, Facebook is also perceived as a risky space, according to respondents, because of its lack of transparency on how personal information is handled and used – let alone protected.Online challengesThe survey also asked its respondents about how safe (or unsafe) they felt, and the types of threats and violence they experienced online, as challenges to the exercise and expressions of their identities and their work on gender and sexuality rights. Social networks – again, primarily Facebook – are the main online spaces where these interactions take place, and much of the online violence reported occurs in interactions with other internet users, as opposed to, for instance, censorship or surveillance on behalf of the state or within their families. For survey respondents, however, the most im-portant factors influencing policies or monitoring EROTICS Global Survey 20178their activities online in ways that limit their sexu-al expressions and activism are government/state actors and internet providers. Thus, although the ex-periences reported do not show the state as a main actor, government and business are perceived as potential violators of privacy and other communica-tions and sexual rights online. Religious authorities were also mentioned as an increasingly active factor in these violations. Overall, respondents indicated a degree of uncertainty related to how secure their online pres-ence really is, and cases of hacking, identity theft, monitoring, stalking, and harassment all add to these feelings, which were more prevalent among LGBTIQ respondents. The reasons underlying such acts of control, surveillance, and online threats, among respondents’ perceptions, show a process of moralising the internet, where the protection of “vulnerable” subjects (women, youth, children) or institutions (the family, the state, country, public decency, and tradition) act as a strategic argument to justify interference with the online activities of groups already discriminated against offline. Notably, then, the state, internet providers and religious authorities are perceived as poten-tial antagonists; and other internet users – usually unknown men – are reported as the main sources of online violence. Therefore, institutional and of-ficial indifference to rights violations, combined with the increasingly open condemnation of minori-ties by some of those institutions (notably, church leaders and state officials), creates an atmosphere where individual aggressors feel emboldened in their acts of anonymous online malice. Unfortunate-ly, for the survey respondents, options for facing these challenges are limited, unless they have the technical savvy to confront online violence and un-wanted monitoring.  Their most frequent responses are non-confrontational solutions, such as leaving the platforms or closing accounts. However, visibilis-ing those events, to gain political or legal leverage, was also mentioned as a viable reaction, and, when that fails, confronting aggressors was also consid-ered an option. So where do we stand…?Sexual morality evidently permeates most forms of State regulation, as well as public concern regarding online safety and security. Many legal, technological, community-sponsored and market internet regulation devices, as well as multiple less formalised everyday practices of protection and self-regulation are driven by moral anxieties, often regarding sexuality. The gen-eral findings of the surveys confirm those observations.The earlier ethnographic findings of the EROT-ICS project indicated that neither the regulation devices’ protective functions nor their potential to unreasonably restrict sexual rights were at all self-evident to sexual rights activists, let alone internet users. The potential of such mechanisms to obstruct the exercise of sexuality and the promotion of sex-ual rights often go ignored, as their primary focus is the protection of traditional values, and especially of subjects conceived as vulnerable.The EROTICS survey reveals, on the one hand, respondents’ perceptions and experiences regarding online safety, closer to the users’ point of view, their skills and digital literacy. On the other hand, the sur-vey is also sensitive to technical and juridical/political forms of regulation, emphasising security dimensions – located at the “hard” level of technological, market and state control. Both those perspectives are crucial to an understanding of the role of internet regula-tion as related to the exercise of sexual rights. It is the goal of the EROTICS project to generate data and develop activist interventions to help bridge the gap between those two dimensions, as well as the duality between freedom and protection. In light of the online experiences mapped by the EROTICS project, one can look at internet regulation as a form of discipline, made of rules and control mecha-nisms, but also of self-regulation and risk management devices both by collectives and by individuals. Our find-ings support the assumption that technical skill and knowledge about regulation do in fact contribute to a fuller exercise of sexual rights. In other words, com-munication rights can and should also be envisioned, and advocated for, as sexual rights.EROTICS Global Survey 20179Delfina Schenone Sienra Mariana PalumboIntroduction: Location, objectives, methodology and limitsThis survey aimed to find out how activists working on gender, sexuality and sexual rights use the inter-net in their work. For this purpose, academics, policy makers and independent activists, among others, were invited to answer a series of questions about the role of the internet in their activism and/or per-sonal life, and the difficulties they face in using it freely and fully, considering their experiences re-garding censorship, violence and surveillance online. These survey objectives respond to the overall EROTICS project,1 which are to enable sexual right activists from different regions to engage politically with the internet as a public space and to counter technology-related violence against women and LG-BTIQ people.This research looked into three main topics: The internet as a means of sexual expression; situations of surveillance, censorship and online harassment; and the resistance strategies the respondents devel-op against these situations. To establish a statistical profile of the survey sample, respondents were also asked about their socio-demographic information. We also inquired about the issues and the organi-sations where respondents work regarding their sexuality and sexual rights activism. All the informa-tion required was guaranteed to be anonymous and confidential, with respondents being notified about their privacy rights before answering the survey.1 EROTICS is a global network of activists, academics and organisations working on sexuality issues including LGBTIQ rights, sex work and sex education, among others. See: https://www.apc.org/en/project/erotics-exploratory-research-project-sexuality-and-internet Data gathering and analysis were both quantita-tive and qualitative. The information was gathered with an online survey2 and with in-depth interviews.3 The survey questionnaire included 31 questions, with 22 closed and 19 open-ended answer options.4 The questionnaire was designed to obtain detailed information about situations of surveillance, censor-ship and violence experienced by the respondents.Regarding the qualitative section of the sur-vey, we conducted eight in-depth interviews with individuals representing different profiles: one cis5 lesbian woman, 30 years old, who is a Spanish mi-grant and lives in Argentina; one cis gay man, 30 years old, from Macedonia; one cis heterosexual woman, 66 years old, from Jamaica; one cis woman, 26 years old, from Egypt, who migrated from a small town to the capital of the country in order to work and study; one cis heterosexual woman with disabili-ties, 42 years old, from Malawi; one trans pansexual woman, 35 years old, from Mexico; one cis hetero-sexual woman, 56 years old, from India, who is a sex work activist; and one queer/trans lesbian woman, 35 years old, from India. These in-depth interviews addressed the same issues as the survey regarding the interviewees’ views about internet use, experi-ences of surveillance, censorship and/or violence, and strategies adopted against those situations.  The main idea of the qualitative part was to select different profiles that were part of the tar-get community, but also to pay special attention to the less represented ones in quantitative studies, 2 To see the quantitative questionnaire, go to appendix 1 at the end of the report. 3 To see the in-depth interview guide, go to appendix 2 at the end of the report. 4 Comprising 12 “other” options + seven open-ended questions (where two are name and email).

It is used for people whose gender identity matches the one they were given when they were born.Sexuality, rights and internet regulations  survey 2017EROTICS Global Survey 201710members of particularly invisibilised or silenced com-munities: people with disabilities, young and elder people, migrants and trans persons. The process of selection of the cases was based on two criteria. On one hand, we contacted people who had completed the online survey and left their email in the “Contact” section of the questionnaire, from where we obtained six of the interviews. On the other hand, APC provided us some contacts of activists who are part of their network, where we obtained the other two interviews: An Indian trans woman and an Indian activist who works on issues related to sex work. We sent emails inviting them to participate in the in-depth interviews and told them about the purpose of the study. We did six inter-views through Skype and two preferred to answer the questions by email. The interviews were done mostly in English with the exception of the ones done in LAC that were done in Spanish. The survey was hosted on the APC website from 19 July through 22 August 2017. The questions, with the exception of the socio-demographic ones, were not compulsory, which is why the questions have dif-ferent numbers of cases. The average time to answer the questionnaire was about 35-40 minutes and the interviews, in average, were one-hour long. The final [quantitative] sample includes 332 cases. The survey was launched first in Spanish and English and then during fieldwork, one week later, three more languages were added: French, Chinese (traditional and simplified) and Arabic.It is important to note that because there are not representative quantitative studies regarding the target population, there is no available infor-mation regarding the quantity of them in each region of the world and therefore there are no possibilities yet to design a representative study re-garding the distribution of the sample. This is why the data comes from a convenience sample, not statistically representative of the universe of sexual rights activism. The distribution strategy consisted on the one hand of contacting by email the target population around the world, especially in regions and areas where APC has contacts. And, on the other hand, by posting the questionnaire on APC’s website and communicating it through Twitter, so that anyone who fulfilled the requirement of being an activist in gender, sexual rights and sexuality issues (wheth-er they were academics, independent bloggers, members of NGOs or worked in something else that involved activity regarding these issues) could an-swer it. Finally, the intention was to include people with a diversity of gender identities and sexual ori-entations, as well as different ages and regions in order to reach people who usually are invisible or have little space in surveys and statistics. Demographics The survey was launched in different regions of the world. The majority of the sample – 40% – lives in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC);6 21% in South, South East and East Asia (SA);7 20% in Africa;8 12% in North America and West-ern Europe;9 4% in Western Asia (WA)10 and 2% in Eastern Europe.11 Because of the quantity of cases and considering cultural similarities, we decided to include the three cases we have of Australia with North America and Western Europe and the four cases from Taiwan and China with South, South East and East Asia. The survey has been analysed in terms of gen-der identity, sexual orientation, regions and issues of work in sex rights activism. However, when the in-formation is disaggregated by these variables there are groups that have very small bases such as Eastern Europe, Western Asia, trans, intersex and pansexual people. They are included in the results showed as total sample but they will not appear in the figures or have their percentages compared with the other groups. Due to the importance that gender identity and sexual orientation have for this study, we will include information of trans and intersex people in absolute numbers in order to shine a light on their situation but the treatment given will be more qual-itative than quantitative. 6 The LAC sample includes: Argentina 63 cases, Brazil 14, Chile 5, Mexico 23, Paraguay 6, Colombia 4, Ecuador 2, Venezuela 2, Nicaragua 3, Costa Rica 2, Peru 2, El Salvador 2, Honduras 2, Bolivia 1 and Dominican Republic 1.7 The South, South East and East Asia sample includes: China 2 cases, Taiwan 2, India 30, Nepal 7, Sri Lanka 5, Pakistan 2, Viet Nam 1, Malaysia 7, Indonesia 5, Cambodia 1, Philippines 3, Myanmar 1, Thailand 2 and Bangladesh 1.8 The Africa sample includes: South Africa 13 cases, Egypt 9, Malawi 1, Kenya 11, Nigeria 7, Tunisia 3, République Democratique du Congo 3, Liberia 1, Burundi 6, Rwanda 1, Algeria 1, Tanzania 3, Sudan 2, Ghana 1, Cameroon 1, Togo 1 and Uganda 1. 9 The North America and Western Europe sample includes: Spain 7 cases, France 2, United States 5, Canada 3, Australia 3, United Kingdom 2, Belgium 1, Portugal 3, Germany 3, Netherlands 3, Malta 1, Italy 4 and Denmark 1.  10 The Western Asia sample includes: Armenia 2 cases, Lebanon 8, Palestine 1, Israel 1 and Turkey 1.11 The Eastern Europe sample includes: Croatia 1 case, Kosovo 1, Albania 1, Serbia 1 and Bosnia and Herzegovina 2. EROTICS Global Survey 201711GenderThe results of the present study show that 86% of the respondents define themselves as cis: 61% as cis women and 25% as cis men. Of the trans and intersex population (20 cases) we have mostly trans men respondents (nine cases). The majority of them live in Africa (10 cases) and LAC (six cases). (Table 1)Sexual orientationIf we focus on sexual orientation, the majority of re-spondents define themselves as LGBQ12 (61%), and more specifically, 17% as gay, 15% as bisexual,13 14% as queer and 11% as lesbian. There were also 2% that defined themselves as pansexual14 and 3% that declared having an “other” sexual orientation.15 The remaining 39% of respondents defined themselves as heterosexual.16 When we look at the distribution by region we see that in Africa the LGBQ community is also the majority but they have a greater presence – 73% – whereas in North America and Western 12 We will address sexual diversity LGBQ without T and I because trans and intersex were asked as gender identities in a different question of sexual orientation from where gay, lesbian, bisexual and queer are. 13 Regarding bisexual people (50 cases) by gender identity we have a majority of cis women with 35 cases and the other 15 cases distribution is: 9 cis men, 1 trans woman, 2 trans men and 3 other gender identity. We decided not to open the category of bisexuals by gender throughout the report due to the small bases that we would have if we consider the cases that are not cis women.14 They answered “Pansexual” in the “Other” open-ended option of the question. 15 These people selected the “Other” open-ended option and we decided to leave them grouped in this category because of the small bases: it includes “I don’t prefer any, but I’m also not hetero”, “Puto”, “Not heterosexual”, “Whatever I feel like it”, “Msm”, “demisexual”, “Group is of various sexualities and gender expression”, “asexual”, and “femmesexual & raromantic”.16 Regarding heterosexual people (128 cases) by gender identity we have a majority of cis women with 103 cases and the other 25 cases distribution is: 19 cis men, 2 trans men, 3 intersex and 1 other gender identity. We decided not to open the category of heterosexuals by gender throughout the report due to the small bases that we would have if we consider the cases that are not cis women. Europe, 59% of respondents are LGBQ and in SA 57% are LGBQ. On the other hand, in LAC, 48% are LGBQ, this being the only region where they are not the majority of respondents. As we can see, the LGBQ population has an important representation in the total sample of the survey. (Figure 1)Migration statusThe majority of the respondents live where they were born. Only 16% are migrants (considering mi-grants as people who live in a country other than that in which they were born). This tendency re-mains the same in the majority of the regions. But in North America and Western Europe this tenden-cy changes, 56% of the respondents of that region are migrants. AgeRegarding age, 74% of respondents are between 18 and 39 years old (between 18 to 29 years old, 39% and between 30 to 39 years old, 36%) and 15% are between 40 and 49 years old. Table 1.

Choose any that applyEROTICS Global Survey 201712If we consider this information by regions, we can see some differences between them. Africa is where there are more people between 18 and 39 years old (86%, where 58% are 18 to 29 and 29% are 30 to 39 years old) than in the total sample. It is followed by SA where there are 76% of them, but here the amounts of each groups are the other way around than Africa: 31% are 18 to 29 and 44% are 30 to 39 years old. In North America and Western Eu-rope and LAC we have a somewhat smaller amount of people of these ages than in the total sample: in the first case we have 71% and in the second one 67%. (Figure 2)Situations of discrimination experienced by the respondentsIn this survey we pay special attention to situations of discrimination that the respondents have lived. We asked if they have ever experienced discrimi-nation based on: the colour of their skin; ethnicity; their social class/caste; any physical disability; health conditions, religion and migrant status. Respond-ents could select more than one type and we also allowed them to add other kinds of discrimination they had suffered, where they stated discrimination based on: sexual orientation, gender identity, physi-cal appearance and age. Among the respondents, 19% indicated they had not suffered any type of discrimination, which implies that 81% of the sample suffered at least one kind of discrimination. Among the ones that were discriminated against in some way, the most frequent types of discrimination are based firstly on social class/caste (26%), followed by ethnicity (20%), colour of skin (19%) and sexual orientation (19%). Two cases mentioned they had suffered all the closed-ended options of discrimination given on the survey: One is a gay cis man who is 36 years old and lives in Pakistan and the other respondent identifies as a non binary pansexual person, who is 34 years old and lives in Australia. (Figure 3)Regarding trans and intersex respondents, out of six trans women, one suffered discrimination based on social class/caste, one for health conditions, two for gender identity and one case indicated that she experienced discrimination based both on ethnicity and physical disability. Out of nine trans men, one indicated that he was discriminated against because of his migrant status, one for the colour of his skin, one by sexual orientation and one by gender identity. Three said they had experienced discrimination for different reasons, one for health conditions, religion and sexual orientation; one for health condition and gender identity; and the last one for colour of skin, health condition and sexual orientation.Of the intersex people, one suffered discrimi-nation because of sexual orientation and one for gender identity. The last three indicated that it was for more than one reason: one for ethnicity, social class/caste and sexual orientation; one for colour of skin, ethnicity and physical appearance; and the last one for physical disability, health condition, gender identity and sexual orientation. If we analyse the information by region, we can see that the four main types of discrimination appear in all of them but with a different order of appearance: in Africa the first type of discrimina-tion is based on the colour of the skin, followed very closely by social class; in North America and Western Europe the first one is sexual orientation based; in LAC the main one is social class and has significant differences with the second type which is by sexual orientation and, finally, in SA the main one is ethnic-ity based followed closely by colour of skin.Through the in-depth interviews with activists we can see that the main discrimination which is based on social class/caste does not appear and they mention instead experiencing discrimination based on their status as activists, their sexual orientation and physical disabilities.

Complete your age in yearsEROTICS Global Survey 201713For example, this activist suffered discrimina-tion from men for her disability. “Have you ever experienced discrimination? Yes. Sometimes some men want you because they know you have disabilities and if you refuse they discrimi-nate you. That happens online. When you are online they are strong to tell you anything.” (Cis heterosexual woman with disabilities, 42 years old, from Malawi) Another activist explains that she suffered dis-crimination because of her gender because she lives in a strongly religious society. This led to her decision to become a feminist activist: “I felt eve-ryone is talking about politics but no one is talking about women. So as a woman in this context and this religious society and community where I grow up I felt like ok I want to talk about myself as a woman and the discrimination I suffered based on my gender. I started to be part of this group by the first anniversary of the Egyptian revolution.” (Cis woman, 26 years old, from Egypt, who migrat-ed from a small town to the capital of the country in order to work and study)In the following part of the survey we asked about the respondents’ activities regarding sexuality and sexual rights: the type of organisation where they work, the activities they develop and the issues they work on. If we analyse the organisation where they work, we can see that the majority of the respondents are members of NGOs (41%), in second place they are inde-pendent activists (18%) and in third place they work in academic, research and/or policy institutes (16%).Considering trans and intersex respondents we see that as in the total sample, they work mostly in NGOs (nine cases) and as independ-ent activists (seven cases). But it is important to mention that there are no trans or intersex re-spondents that work in academic, research and/or policy institutes. Also, following the same trend as the total sample, out of 18 respondents with physical disabilities, eight work in NGOs, four are Figure 3.

Q24. Choose any that applyEROTICS Global Survey 201714independent activists and two work in academic, research and/or policy institutes. If we now consider this information by region, we notice that there are some differences between the regions. African respondents follow the same trend as the total sample as does SA, but the difference be-tween NGOs and independent activists is significant. On the contrary, in North America and Western Europe, in first place we have independent activists, in second place the respondents work in academic, research and/or policy Institutes and in third place we find NGOs. And finally in LAC, the difference is that there are more respondents working in academic institutes than as in-dependent activists. The issues on which the respondents work most-ly17 are LGBTIQ rights, women’s rights (both 42%) and sexual health (28%). (Figure 4)17 The respondents were asked to pick only one option which represented the best description of their organisation’s or their work. They were given a list of options and they could also write down something else if they needed to in “others”, which was open-ended (only seven respondents used it).It is important to note that if you analyse the two main issues by sexual orientation and gender identity, you find that 86% of LGBTIQ respondents work on their rights. If we take a look at trans and intersex we can see that four out of six trans women respondents, all trans men respondents and four out of five intersex respondents work on this issue. On the other hand, 54% of heterosexual respondents work on women’s rights, this being their main topic. This probably has to do with the composition of the sample of heterosexuals, where 80% are cis women.Considering this by region, the only thing that is worthy of mention is that in LAC 52% of the re-spondents work on women’s rights being the only region where this issue is in first place. Regarding the activities in relation to sexuality and sexual rights that best describe the work and activism of the respondents, we find that in first place they dedicate to writing, documentation, production and dissemination of information, followed closely by train-ing and capacity building, and in third place they work on raising public awareness and campaigns.

Please select at most 2 answersEROTICS Global Survey 201715Considering the four most common activities, it is quite interesting to notice that cis women engage more than cis men in writing, documenting and dis-seminating information (40% and 36% in each case) and training and building capacity in their organisa-tions (35% versus 33%), whereas cis men engage more than cis women in activities that have to do with pub-lic space and public appearances such as raising public awareness and campaigns (31% and cis women: 27%) and advocacy, policy and law reform (29% versus 23%). “We work on online campaigns concerned about bodily autonomy for ex abortion, sexual harassment, virginity including the intersec-tionality between violation, voice public and public fear. Also in offline campaigns, for ex-ample, the event was named: We will ride bicycles, is about the right to city.” (Cis woman, 26 years old, from Egypt)If we consider trans respondents, we can see see some differences between the total sample. Out of nine trans men respondents, six work on raising pub-lic awareness/campaigns and five in advocacy, policy and law reform and three out of six trans women respondents work on training and capacity building. “My activism involves public advocacy, govern-ment liaison/representation (especially right now as the government of India is pushing through a Trans Rights Bill that is very poorly drafted), writ-ing about trans, sexuality, and gender rights for digital publications, and some direct/personal work with trans people. I am also a queer/les-bian trans woman, and I write specifically about ideas of gender and sexuality with respect to non-binary trans persons.”  (Trans queer/lesbian woman, 35 years old, from India)Regarding respondents with disabilities we can see that, following the trend of the sample, three out of 18 work on writing, documenting and disseminating information and also another three work on rais-ing public awareness and campaigns, being the two most common activities between them. If we focus on the regions we can see some dif-ferences of order but the main activities remain the same: following the trend of the sample, in North Figure 5.

Q3. Please select at most 2 optionsEROTICS Global Survey 201716America and Western Europe and in LAC the most important activity is writing, documentation, pro-duction and dissemination of information (59% of the respondents and 37% respectively). On the con-trary, in Africa and SA the main activity done by the respondents is training and capacity building (44% and 47% in each case). Sexual expressionThe internet is considered an “important” or “very important” medium of sexual expression by 66% of the sample (among them, 39% consider it “very im-portant”). In this part of the analysis we will focus on the positive aspects of the online world and the uses of the internet by sexuality and sexual rights activists, especially for groups that have more dif-ficulties to express themselves in offline spaces without being discriminated against, such as the LG-BTIQ community. As one of our interviewees from LAC expressed, “The internet has been fundamental because for LGBTIQ activism, and also for feminists, Fa-cebook allows the building of networks that would be very difficult to build in another way. It also allows the exchange of information in an efficient way, that would be very difficult in an-other way. The LGBTIQ population is small and is distributed everywhere and it would not be possible to have a face-to-face network.” (Trans pansexual woman, 35 years old, from Mexico)Regarding this information by sexual orientation, we can see that for LGBTIQ respondents it is much more important than for heterosexuals: it is very important for 55% of gay respondents, 44% of bi-sexuals, 42% of queer and 37% of lesbians versus 28% for heterosexuals. Q: Which are the positive aspects of using the internet for your activism?A: It allows us to communicate and the informa-tion flows more quickly. (Cis lesbian woman, 30 years old, Spanish migrant who lives in Argentina)One of our interviewees, a trans activist from India suggests: “The good/positive aspect of my work on the internet is the amplification afford-ed by platforms such as Twitter and Facebook – which allow for my voice and my writing to be read by people not originally part of the au-dience. It also allows me to interact with, build communities with other trans/queer persons from around the world, who may be operat-ing under similar circumstances as I do.” (Trans queer/lesbian woman, 35 years old, from India)If we now consider this information by region, we can see that in Africa (44%) and North America and Western Europe (51%), the level of answers of “very important” is above average. Here we can see how frequently and in what ways an African respondent uses it:Q: How frequently do you use the internet?A: 24/7Q: Which are the positive aspects of using the internet for your activism?Figure 6.

It allows us to access and to be ac-cessed, to be more visible than in offline events. (Cis woman, 26 years old, from Egypt)If we observe the ways in which the internet is use-ful for our respondents in relation to sexuality and sexual rights, we can see that most of them use it to share critical information quickly and widely (84%) and search for information that is difficult to find in offline spaces (82%). Considering the different regions, the first three uses are similar in all of the regions. (Figure 7)Another interviewee, a cis woman who is an ac-tivist from the LAC region, says: “The use of the internet is very good because if you have a blog, your organisation will be known faster. Also when you want to communicate, using What-sApp is easier and cheap (…) I am able to reach a much wider audience, especially overseas, and to share experiences with them.” (Cis heterosex-ual woman, 66 years old, from Jamaica)The survey continued asking about how fre-quently the respondents use different digital platforms to access, produce and/or share content regarding sexuality or sexual rights from any device. If we first consider any frequency of use – “some-times”, “often” or “always” – we can identify that social networks (98%) are in first place, followed by instant messaging and email (both 92%), other web-sites (89%), blogs (87%) and hosting services (85%). The least used ones are sexting apps (17%) private chat rooms (32%) and menstrual cycle apps (36%). If we consider only the most frequent use – “always” – we notice that the three main platforms remain the same but with a different order: instant messaging (64%), email (63%) and social networks (61%). If we consider trans and intersex respondents and those with physical disabilities, we do not see anything worth mentioning, because the trend re-mains the same as the total sample. (Figure 8)If we take a look at these three most used platforms we can see that regarding instant mes-saging WhatsApp is the leader (90%), followed by Messenger (37%); in second place we have email where Gmail is on top (87%) and is followed by Hotmail (15%) but there is a long distance between Figure 7.

Choose any that applyEROTICS Global Survey 201718the two as you can see; and finally, if we consider social networks the most popular one among the respondents is Facebook (94%) followed far behind by Instagram (27%). Another of our interviewees, a cis heterosexual woman who is an African activist, indicates that these platforms are fundamental for her activ-ism: “The platforms I use more are Facebook, email (Gmail and Yahoo), WhatsApp. Website and Skype internationally. But local is email, Fa-cebook and WhatsApp. Sometimes Twitter but not so much. The most important is Facebook and Whatsapp.” (Cis heterosexual woman with disabilities, 42 years old, from Malawi)After asking in what ways the internet is useful, we asked about the content the respondents search, share and/or produce. We could see that there are three main types of content: sexual health in-formation, information about sexual violence and information related to LGBTIQ. For an activist with disabilities the internet al-lows her to share information and experiences about the way she lives her sexuality, which is different from the mainstream. Q: On the internet you find whatever you want? A: On the internet you google any information as long as it is online and you can find it. Espe-cially when you talk about sexuality, gender and disability you google and you find. And also you can share. Internet is friendly and you can find information about sexuality, gender, disability.” (Cis heterosexual woman with disabilities, 42 years old, from Malawi).Considering differences by gender identity, we find that cis men respondents search, share or produce more than cis women in LGBTIQ rights (78% versus 59%), in erotic content (46% versus 25%) and in in-formation related to sex work (34% versus 18%).Although the base of intersex and trans re-spondents is small, we can see that they search Figure 8.

Trans women and trans men search mostly information related to LGBTIQ rights, while intersex respondents search, in first place, information related to other marginalised groups, communities and sexual practices. (Table 2)Regarding our respondents with physical disabili-ties, it is interesting to note that the two main topics they search, share or produce are those related to LGBTIQ people and information about other margin-alised groups. The first topic has probably to do with the composition of the sample, where the majority of them are from the LGBQ community (only three out of 18 are heterosexual) and the second one has probably to do with their physical condition. (Table 3)Threats on the internetIn this part of the document we analyse the nega-tive aspects of the use of the internet for activists on sexuality and sexual rights. Our respondents have experienced different kinds of threats: the most frequent – if we add “sometimes”, “often” and “al-ways”– are harassment (75%), intimidating online comments (63%) and blocked websites or filtering software that prevented the user from accessing in-formation (54%). (Figure 10)There are no significant differences between re-gions, but it is interesting to notice that in Africa is where these situations are more frequently reported by the respondents than in other regions (except for the category censorship by law).One of our interviewees who is an Egyptian ac-tivist shared with us that she has experienced harassment, intimidating comments, hacking at-tempts and so-called “revenge porn”: “When I started to talk about bodily rights in 2012 I start-ed to be targeted personally, my account suffered hacking attempts. Every discussion I make on the internet has cyberbullying against me (…). When I broke with my boyfriend, he was mad with me because he wanted me to be in the religion with him. When I refused he started to threaten me with some private content: nude photos and a video showing me dancing.” (Cis heterosexual woman, 26 years old, from Egypt)When we take a look at threats by gender identity there are no significant differences except for some of these situations: 64% of cis women suffered intimidat-ing comments versus 54% of cis men. On the contrary, regarding censorship, 44% of cis men experienced it Figure 9.

In the same way as the total sam-ple, the most common threats are harassment and intimidating comments and, unlike the average of respondents, threats appear at the same level as in-timidating comments. A trans activist from Mexico told us: “I have had awkward situations with users (…) One, I think, it was a troll, a man who joked about my new name in Facebook. He asked me why I chose my name. He wrote me a comment on my Facebook wall. He talked to me in the masculine form and I asked him to stop doing that. At first, I thought that he really misunderstood but later I realised he did it on pur-pose. He started joking about my name. Later he started joking about all the trans persons. I decided not to start a discussion and I blocked him” (Trans pansexual woman, 35 years old, from Mexico)Considering these threats by sexual orientation, we can notice that in some of them there are differences between heterosexual and LGBQ respondents: 28% of heterosexuals versus 48% of LGBQ respondents suffered censorship, 17% of heterosexuals versus 35% of LGBQ respondents experienced censorship by law, 29% versus 41% regarding viruses, 40% ver-sus 62% in being blocked, 23% versus 37% in having their personal information revealed and finally 13% versus 25% in having their profile closed.Another of our interviewees, a cis lesbian woman who is an activist and currently lives in Argentina, experienced these two situations due to her activ-ism: “Different people entered in my Facebook profile and called me ‘feminazi’ and wrote hun-dreds of offensive comments. They almost told me that if they fucked me I would be cured of lesbi-anism.” (Cis lesbian woman, 30 years old, who is a Spanish migrant and lives in Argentina)When we asked the respondents to describe more about these threats they had suffered because of their activity on the internet, they shared with us that the violence is based on their publications, posts or sharing of information about anything regarding abortion or issues about the LGBTIQ population. Of 58 responses in an open-ended question regarding the subject, 21% indicated abortion and another 21% LGBTIQ. Of the 76 responses regarding where it happened, we can see that it occurs mainly on social networks: in first place Facebook (59%), followed by Twitter (16%). Out of the 57 respondents that said who did it, we can see that it is mainly done by people they do not know (32%) followed by friends and family (25%) and men in general (11%). From the open-ended questions, the respondents told us some of their experiences:“People I didn’t know sharing posts (on FB) with LGBT content and triggering violent, threat-ening, homophobic comments which were signalled to me by friends.” (Cis queer woman, 33 years old, Portugal)“A stalker once accessed my Facebook profile which forced me to deactivate my account temporarily.” (Cis heterosexual woman, 26 years old, India)“In 2016 we received many threats and aggres-sions from trolls on Twitter and Facebook for demanding sexual health resources from the state.” (Trans gay man, 40 years old, Argentina)After gathering information about the violent ex-periences the respondents had online, we inquired about which actors they think are the most impor-tant in influencing the policies or monitoring their activities online and limiting their sexual expressions and activism on sexuality and sexual rights. There are two main actors that were identified as the ones which have more power to influence, limit or moni-tor expressions regarding sexuality: first 66% of the respondents mentioned government/state and second 64% said the internet providers. What is in-teresting is that in third place we have peers,18 which are people that they know. When analysing the information by gender identity and sexual orientation there are no signifi-cant differences. (Figure 11) If we consider this information by region we can see that there are two trends: in Africa (76%) and 18 In the questionnaire, the description of peers included family members, friends and acquaintances.EROTICS Global Survey 201722SA (86%) the government/state is above average and is much more important than the other actors. On the contrary, in LAC and in North America and Western Europe, we see that internet providers are seen as the main actor, 67% and 68% in each case. There are also differences between the importance that peers and religious authorities have in each re-gion: where in Africa (56%) and SA (49%) the third most important actor are peers, in North America and Western Europe and LAC it is religious authori-ties, 32% and 46% in each case. Besides inquiring who the perceived actors are limiting the expressions on sexuality and sexual rights, we asked about these constituencies’ ac-tivity. It is very interesting to see that although the government/state is the most powerful or influential actor for total respondents so far, the religious authorities have the higher level of vio-lence and harassment against activists in the last three years.The interviewees do not state that they expe-rienced surveillance from the government but they consider it an actor that may do it and they mention other activists who suffer surveillance “They are watching their emails and social media accounts. There was a case with a political activ-ist two weeks ago. The mobile company used her own accounts on Facebook and they stole by contacting the company. That is for state actors. Her accounts remained in the security forces for a night.” (Cis woman, 26 years old, from Egypt) As we can see in this comment, the state or govern-ment wanted to control this activist but she works with other actors in order to resist the control. (Figure 12)If we take a look at this information by gender identity, we can state that cis women perceive the increase of the level of violence and harassment by all of the actors more than cis men.

Please select at most 3 optionsEROTICS Global Survey 201723and respondents with physical disabilities follow the same trend as the total sample. Also, if we consider the differences by sexual orientation, we can point out that 61% of LGBQ respondents (where lesbians, at 77%, are above average) said that government/state has increased versus 49% of heterosexuals and that 74% of LGBQ respondents said that religious authorities have increased their level of violence ver-sus 64% of heterosexuals. Besides these threats, our respondents were asked to talk about their experiences of censorship and sur-veillance. The most frequent situation they mentioned, given certain options, is that their social media pres-ence was intensively followed by other people in a way that made them feel uncomfortable or even unsafe. If we add the options “sometimes” and “often”, we can see that 43% of the respondents suffered at least one instance of this kind of surveillance. In second place we can see that 39% of the respondents indicated that someone attempted to obtain their username, pass-word and credit card details, and it is closely followed by 38% that mention that mainstream apps have used their location data and/or personal information with-out their knowledge or consent. It is important to mention the high percentage of “don’t know” responses that appear in this ques-tion, which probably has to do with the nature of the threat these situations represent: most of them are hard to identify and its main purpose is that people do not know they are under surveillance. (Figure 13)If we analyse the information by region, we notice that Africa is higher than the other regions in all of these situations. Also if we take a look at differences by sexual orientation we can see that LGBQ respondents present higher percentages than heterosexuals in all of the surveillance situations: for example, 47% of LGBQ respondents declared to have been followed on social media versus 37% of heterosexuals or 43% of LGBQ respondents said that someone attempted to obtain their username, password and/or credit card details versus 31% of heterosexuals. (Table 4)Regarding gender identity, we can see that among trans and intersex respondents, the first situation is that someone attempted to obtain their username, password and/or credit card: three trans women, five trans men and two intersex re-spondents; the second one is that another person or Figure 12.

EROTICS Global Survey 201724organisation made a background screening of them without their authorisation: four trans women, two trans men and two intersex respondents.The subjects, topics and content that are cen-sored, regulated, monitored or filtered most frequently, in the opinion of the respondents, are if we consider “likely” and “very likely”: pedophilia (81%), anti-government, abortion (both 68%) and “obscene” content (67%). (Figure 14)If we analyse the degree of censorship and regu-lation by region, we can see some differences: North America and Western Europe and SA shared the same three main topics, but in a different order. In North America and Western Europe, pedophilia (100%), “obscene” content (69%) and anti-government (54%). In SA anti-government (87%), pedophilia (86%) and obscene content (80%). On the other hand, in Africa we can see that the three most cen-sored, regulated and monitored issues are: sexual diversity (79%), closely followed by contraception and pedophilia (both 78%). Finally, in LAC, abortion is in first place (84%), followed by pedophilia (81%) andcontraception (63%). If we consider this information by sexual orien-tation, there are no significant differences. In the case of trans and intersex respondents we notice that following the same trend of the total sample, pedophilia appears as the main topic “likely” or “very likely” to be censored; in second place, “ob-scene” content and in third place we find anti government, sexual diversity and abortion. One of our interviewees, who is an activist for abortion rights in LAC, indicates that the level of harassment and censorship is very high in the country where she lives: “It is not easy to sup-port women who abort in a legally restrictive Figure 13.

Everything is recorded so we started using other platforms and tools where no information could be re-corded.” (Cis lesbian woman, 30 years old, lives in Argentina)Likewise, in Figure 12, where we analysed the level of control by different actors regarding the level of violence and harassment, the actors whose level of censorship and surveillance increased the most, in the respondents’ perception, were government and religious authorities. But here government (69%) was perceived as increasing more than religious au-thorities (60%). Also the third actor here is internet providers and in the other case was someone un-known.

Trans and intersex respondents fol-low the same trend as the total sample. Regarding the regions, we can see differenc-es. Firstly, the perception towards the increase of government activity is different: in SA 76% of the respondents mentioned it versus 67% and 68% of African and Latin-American respondents in each case and 56% in North America and Western Europe. As we can see in one of the open-ended ques-tion responses: “I don’t think this counts as violence necessarily but the Indian government does censor a lot of sites, as well as other forms of media.” (Cis bisexual migrant woman, 23 years old, from India)Referring to someone unknown we also find that: 35% of African respondents and 33% in LAC perceived the increase versus 44% in North America and Western Eu-rope and 40% in SA. In the case of peers, we notice that in Africa and SA they are mentioned by 49% and 30% of respondents respectively versus 13% and 14% in North America and Western Europe and LAC respec-tively. Finally, in the case of religious authorities we see that SA respondents are the ones who perceived the largest increase (66%), followed by LAC (61%), Africa (58%) and North America and Western Europe (47%). It is important to mention that although the ac-tors that appear to be the ones that increased their censorship and surveillance the most are government or religious authorities, when respondents explained more about their experiences in the open-ended ques-tion and in the interviews, what appeared the most are mentions of people they do not know, and they suggest that the majority of them are men.

It was an unknown man who did it and he insulted me.” (Cis heterosexual woman, 30 years old, from Colombia)After inquiring about the actors, we asked about the reasons they give to regulate, prohibit, remove and/or censor content. Among the most common rea-sons given by the government or/and corporations to regulate, prohibit, remove and/or censor content that the respondents search, share or produce on the internet, we find that the main reason used to censor content is public decency (52%), followed at a long distance by anti-terrorism (27%) and preserv-ing tradition (22%). (Figure 16)There are no significant differences by gender identity, except for trans and intersex respondents who mention in the first place “preserving tradi-tion”. If we consider this information by sexual orientation, we can see that regarding “public de-cency”, gay respondents are the ones that mention this reason (63%) more than the others: for ex-ample, 47% of lesbians mentioned it and 50% of heterosexuals. In relation to “preserving tradition”, 32% of lesbians mentioned it, more than in the oth-er groups and the total sample. When we look at the information by region, we can see that in terms of “public decency” there are no big differences between them: in all of the regions it is in the first place. What is interesting is that “anti-ter-rorism” is in third place in Africa, SA and LAC but it is in first place, sharing it with “public decency”, in North America and Western Europe. Later on we inquired about all the digital platforms they use, and which ones they consider to offer less pro-tection of their personal information. Once again, the name of one social network in particular appeared in first place and far away from any other platform: Face-book, with 55% of 263 respondents to an open-ended question saying that this social network is particularly dangerous because they believe that Facebook has ac-cess to a lot of personal information, the privacy terms are not transparent and are changed all the time, and because they know that they sell personal information to governments and companies for marketing reasons, publicity or political reasons.As these two open-ended responses express:“Facebook (offers less protection for personal in-formation) I think because if someone is not your friend they can still see decent amount of informa-tion.” (Cis heterosexual woman, 21 years old, India)Figure 16.

Please select at most two optionsEROTICS Global Survey 201728“Facebook – not a very secure system with easy loopholes for third party access.” (Cis heterosex-ual woman, 25 years old, Italy)This survey also inquired about which types of con-tent the respondents have trouble finding online, considering that the online world is as biased as the offline world. As we have already seen, at the same time that the internet offers a place for diversity and sexual expression, it also reproduces the dis-crimination against and invisibility of certain groups, identities and subjects.  As the graph below shows, more than half of the respondents (55%) have trouble finding some kind of content, whereas 45% said that they did not have any trouble finding what they need. We can identify that there are four main types of content that are the most difficult to find: anti-government or anti-national material in first place (23%), followed by content related to abortion (19%) in second place, and in third place, content related to sexual education (17%) and to LGBTIQ issues (16%). (Figure 17)In this question there are no significant differ-ences between cis women and cis men, but we do find that half of trans and intersex respondents express trouble in finding content related to ho-mosexuality or trans (10 out of 20 cases). Regarding sexual orientation, the two types of content where we find differences are abortion and anti-govern-ment content. In the first case, 23% of heterosexuals (with the majority being cis women) mentioned it versus 16% of LGBQ respondents and in the second case, we have 29% of LGBQ respondents versus 13% of heterosexuals.When we focus on the regions, the only things worth mention are that in Africa the main content that is difficult to find are about homosexuality and trans (29%) and in LAC the main one is abortion (33%).Finally, in the last part of this section, we focus our analysis on the views of the respondents re-garding their use of the internet, censorship and surveillance. In these statements we can condense both negative and positive aspects of their use of the internet that we have seen throughout the analysis of the survey. The first finding is that they do not consider the internet as a safe place: 88% of the respondents indicated, if we add “agree” plus “strongly agree”, that corporations do very little or nothing when they receive complaints of threats from their users. Also, the internet is considered by 86% of the sample a space that re-produces discrimination, violence and inequalities based on gender, class, race and religion; 80% of the respondents think that internet corporations manipulate the information, content, opinions and trends and 78% think they use or sell their personal information without their consent. On the other hand, 88% of them consider that the in-ternet enables and increases the power, visibility, communication and organisation of women and minorities. (Figure 18)Figure 17.

Please select at most 3 optionsEROTICS Global Survey 201729Strategies of resistanceWhen inquiring about the strategies that the respond-ents develop to counteract the threats on the internet, we can identify four groups: first we have diverse tech-nical responses which are used by 70% of the sample; secondly, 48% perform non-confrontational solutions such as leaving the platforms or closing accounts; in third place, 29% use or develop political, social and le-gal strategies to visibilise the situations and finally 16% of the respondents try to talk to or confront the aggres-sor and solve the problem. (Figure 19)In the interviews we see that some activists have different strategies including the use of dig-ital security technology and taking part in digital security workshops. Q: Do you know if activist groups have strate-gies to avoid violence, control, censorship or surveillance online? A: Yes. Some groups are constantly moderating and removing abusive comments, behaviours and accounts. Other groups use digital security tech – to protect and limit exposure of personal identifiable info – such as VPNs, anonymisers, etc. There are digital security and network security workshops organised by certain sexuality/rights organisations that invite the activist community to take part and learn better security protocols.” (Trans queer/lesbian woman, 35 years old, India).Although the respondents perform those strategies, when we ask if they read the security and privacy terms and condition when they download a program or application on the internet, we can see that they do not always read them. Just 8% answered “al-ways” and 17% “often”. The most frequent answer is “sometimes” (44%) followed by 30% that said “never”. This attitude also appears in the in-depth interviews, where interviewees said that they do not read the terms and conditions, and in just one case one of the interviewees said that sometimes she does so (cis heterosexual woman, 26 years old, Egypt). Main findings• 81% of the sample suffered at least one kind of discrimination. The most frequent types of dis-crimination are based on social class/caste (26%), ethnicity (20%), colour of skin (19%) and sexual orientation (19%).  • The majority of the respondents are members of NGOs (41%), independent activists (18%) and work in academic, research and/or policy institutes (16%). • The issues in which the respondents work mostly are LGBTIQ rights, women´s rights (both 42%) and sexual health (28%). It is important to notice that if you analyse the two main issues by sexual orientation and gender identity, you find that 86% of LGBQ and trans and intersex respondents work on their rights.

The bases are showed on the figure as (x). EROTICS Global Survey 201730• Regarding the activities in relation to sexu-ality and sexual rights that best describe the work and activism of the respondents, we find that in first place they dedicate their time to writing, documentation, production and dis-semination of information (39%), followed closely by training and capacity building (34%), and in third place they work on raising public awareness and campaigns (29%). If we consider trans respondents, we can see some differences from the total sample. Out of nine trans men respondents, six work on raising public awareness/campaigns and five in advo-cacy, policy and law reform and three out of six trans women respondents work on training and capacity building.  • Regarding the internet as a medium for sexual expression we can observe that the internet is considered an “important” or “very important” by 66% of the sample, especially for groups that have more difficulties in expressing themselves without being discriminated against in offline spaces. For LGBQ respondents it is much more important than for heterosexuals. If we now con-sider this information by region, we can see that in Africa (44%) and North America and Western Europe (51%) the level of answers of “very im-portant” is above average. • Respondents frequently use digital platforms such as social networks (98%), instant messaging and emails (both 92%), other web sites (89%), blogs (87%) and hosting services (85%) to access, produce and/or share content regarding sexual-ity or sexual rights. Facebook (94%), is the main social network; WhatsApp (90%) the main in-stant messaging company, and Gmail (87%) the principal option for sending and receiving emails. What is interesting is that while Facebook is the most used social network, it is at the same time the platform the respondents perceive, in 55% of the cases, as the most dangerous because they believe it has access to a lot of personal in-formation, the privacy terms are not transparent and they are constantly changing. • If we observe the ways in which the internet is useful for our respondents in relation to sexuality and sexual rights, we can see that most of them use it to share critical informa-tion quickly and widely (84%) and search for information that is difficult to find in offline spaces (82%). The types of content they main-ly search, share and/or produce are: sexual health information, information about sexual violence (both 68%) and information related to LGBTIQ issues (67%).  Figure 19.

Af-rica is the region where these situations are most frequently reported by activists. • The actors the respondents identified as the ones which have more power to influence, limit or monitor expressions regarding sexuality are gov-ernment/state (66%) and internet providers (64%). What is interesting is that in third place we have peers (40%), which are people that they know. If we consider this information by region we can see that there are two trends: in Africa and SA the government/state is above average (76% and 86% in each case) and is much more important than the other actors. On the contrary, in LAC (67%) and in North America and Western Europe (68%), we see that internet providers are seen as the main actor. There are also differences between the importance that peers and religious authorities have in each region: whereas in Africa and SA the third most important actor is peers (56% and 49% respectively), in North America and Western Europe (32%) and LAC (46%) it is religious authorities. • In the last three years, although the government/state is the most powerful or influential actor for total respondents so far, the religious authorities have a higher level of violence and harassment against activists. Cis women perceive the increase of the level of violence and harassment of all of the actors more than cis men. Trans, intersex and respondents with physical disabilities follow the same trend as the total sample. • Situations of surveillance and censorship are com-monly experienced by the respondents. The most frequent one is that the social media presence of the respondents was intensively followed by other people in a way that made them feel uncomfortable or even unsafe: 43% of the respondents suffered at least one such experience. If we analyse the surveil-lance situations by sexual orientation, we can see that LGBTIQ respondents present higher percent-ages than heterosexuals.  • The actors that increased the level of censorship and surveillance were government and religious authorities. Africa is above the other regions in all of these situations. These are the same actors that increase their level of violence and harass-ment against activists in the last three years.• The subject, topics and types of content that are censored, regulated, monitored or filtered most frequently, in the opinion of the respondents, are if we consider “likely” and “very likely”: pedophilia (81%), anti-government, abortion (both 68%) and “obscene” content (67%).  • Among the most common reasons given by the government or/and corporations to regulate, prohibit, remove and/or censor content that the respondents search, share or produce on the in-ternet, we find that the main reason to censor content is public decency (52%) followed at a long distance by anti-terrorism (27%) and pre-serving tradition (22%). Regarding this finding there are no significant differences opinions by gender identity, except for trans and intersex respondents who mention in the first place “preserving tradition”. It is interesting to note that if we analyse this information by region, we can see that “public decency” is in first place in all the regions. What is interesting is that “anti-terrorism” is in third place in Africa, SA and LAC but it is in first place, sharing it with “public de-cency”, in North America and Western Europe. • 55% of the respondents have trouble finding some kind of content. We can identify that there are four main types of content that are the most difficult to find: anti-government or anti-na-tional material in first place (23%) and content related to abortion (19%) in second place, con-tent related to sexual education (17%) in third place, and contents related to LGBTIQ issues in fourth (16%).• If we focus our analysis on the views of the respondents regarding their use of the in-ternet, censorship and surveillance, they do not consider the internet as a safe place and consider that corporations do very little or nothing when they receive complaints of threats from their users. Also, the internet is mainly considered by the sample a space that reproduces discrimination, violence and inequalities based on gender, class, race and religion and that internet corporations manipulate the information, content, opin-ions and trends. Also the respondents think that internet corporations use or sell their EROTICS Global Survey 201732personal information without their consent. On the other hand, 88% of them consider that the internet enables and increases the power, visibility, communication and organisation of women and minorities.  • Finally, in terms of strategies of resistance against surveillance, censorship and threats, the respondents firstly develop diverse technical re-sponses (70%) followed by non-confrontational solutions (48%) and in third place, political, so-cial and/or legal strategies (29%).EROTICS Global Survey 201733   APPENDIx 1Please read these instructions before filling in the survey:1.
