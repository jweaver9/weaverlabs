But the part that made me persevere through this project were the administrators who asked me to closet myself and my life from the classroom, the pastors who asked me to step down from leadership positions, and the countless others who asked me to be a little less me for their own comfort. I think about the children in classrooms across this nation who are struggling to be themselves, to find support, and to feel safe. I think about the LGBTQ+ educators in classrooms across this nation who are struggling to be themselves, to find support, and to feel safe. It can often feel like the weight of the world is crashing down on the LGBTQ+ community. However, the history of those marginalized has shown us, time and time again, that when it seems there is nothing around us but darkness, we will make our own light.    Kassidi M. Adams          4  Abstract This paper explores research that discusses the impact of a culturally responsive education and lack-of for LGBTQ+ students and recommends a solution to ensure all students are safe and represented in schools. The research cited varies in their definitions and uses of the term LGBTQ+. This paper will use the term LGBTQ+, an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and more communities; however, the abbreviation used in the referenced research may be shortened to LG, LGB, LGBT, or LGBTQ to reflect only specific communities included in LGBTTTQQIAAP (VandenBos, 2015). This paper will also focus on inclusion, which refers to increasing learning and participation for all students. Inclusion involves valuing all students and staff equally, increasing the participation of students, and removing barriers to learning and participation (Booth & Ainscow, 2002). Finally, this project will discuss the importance of anti-bias education through the lens of culturally relevant teaching. Anti-bias education refers to supporting children to develop: a confident sense of identity without needing to feel superior to others; an ease with human diversity; a sense of fairness and justice; the skills of empowerment; and the ability to stand up for themselves and for others (Derman-Sparks and Edwards, 2019). When using the terms anti-bias or LGBTQ+ inclusive, this paper does not wish to de-center race or ethnicity but rather focus on the role gender and sexuality play with the understanding that social identities are intersectional.

Representation is important in the development of children. In an ideal situation, all children, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, would feel safe and represented in the classroom. According to research, teachers have an ethical responsibility to ensure that all students, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, receive a high-quality education (Hall & Rodgers, 2018). Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 ensures every child, regardless of sex or sexual orientation, is entitled to an equal learning environment where physical and emotional safety is promoted (2018). But currently, schools are a hostile place for LGBTQ+ students. According to research, 55.5% of LGBTQ+ students feel unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation and 37.8% because of their gender expression (Greytak et al., 2016). Sixty percent of LGBTQ+ youth have experienced discrimination due to either their sexual orientation or gender identity; only 13% of LGBTQ+ students reported hearing positive messages about being LGBQT+ in schools; and 40% of LGBTQ+ students have seriously considered suicide (Miranda et al., 2018; Paley, 2020). The discrimination of and lack of positive representation for LGBTQ+ students create a negative school environment for these students. Thus, many LGBTQ+ students do not feel safe or welcomed in schools and classrooms (Greytak et al., 2016; Miranda et al., 2018; Paley, 2020; Poteat, 2011). By rethinking our approach to inclusionary practices within schools, we can ensure the safety and representation of all LGBTQ+ students.  Importance and Rationale of the Project Many factors affect LGBTQ+ students’ safety and inclusion in schools. One example is anti-LGBTQ+ behavior is often normalized among students and teachers. Research by Clark and   8  Blackburn (2009) discusses how homophobia is normalized in schools. In the schools studied, teachers assumed students were straight and “aggressively homophobic,” and students were allowed to not engage with LGBTQ+ themed texts if they felt uncomfortable, which normalizes the suggestion that it is okay to maintain a homophobic position (Clark & Blackburn, 2009, p. 27). The study also found that LGBTQ+ themed texts were introduced to students in a way that would prompt empathy towards LGBTQ+ students, causing students to feel sorry for gay people, which positions LGBTQ+ students as pitiable (Clark & Blackburn, 2009). Because teachers assume students are straight and homophobic, and then fail to challenge heteronormative beliefs, homophobic views are empowered and normalized among students. This leaves LGBTQ+ students not only feeling unwelcomed and disconnected from school, but literacy as well.  Another factor affecting the safety and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students is that teachers do not feel comfortable teaching about the LGBTQ+ community or addressing bias in the classroom. Some reasons for this are because LGBTQ+ topics in schools are met with resistance from some community members and conservative groups, teachers are not properly trained on how to address homophobia, and because some teachers themselves hold negative biases towards the LGBTQ+ community. The Gay and Lesbian Independent School Teachers Network (GLSEN) conducted a survey of U.S. secondary school students and teachers and found educators were least comfortable in their capacity to address an anti-LGBTQ+ bias when compared to all other biases studied (Greytak et al., 2016). Further, 15.3 percent of students heard teachers make a homophobic remark, and only 28.3 percent of students said that teachers often or very often intervened when hearing students make homophobic remarks, even though teachers reported that the most common biased language heard from students were homophobic remarks (Greytak et al., 2016). Whether teachers choose to ignore the comments or don’t feel   9  comfortable addressing anti-LGBTQ+ comments, it still results in an unsafe environment for LGBTQ+ students.  Research by Hall and Rodgers (2018) indicates that although teachers’ attitudes toward homosexuality have become more promising over time, many teachers still hold negative attitudes toward the LGBTQ+ community. This could contribute to the fact that, based on the GLSEN survey, only 14.9 percent of teachers include LGBTQ+ topics in their curriculum, only 28.1 percent of teachers provided one-on-one support to LGBTQ+ students, only 11.9 percent of teachers displayed LGBTQ+ supportive materials, and why teachers are least likely to work on LGBTQ+ related school-wide issues. Research indicates that teachers play a vital role in influencing student behaviors and interactions with LGBTQ+ students because it can contribute to either a hostile or supportive school environment (Hall & Rodgers, 2018). Further, supportive educators are one of the Four Core Supports identified by the GLSEN Research Institute that improves school climates for LGBTQ+ youth (Clark & Kosciw, 2022). It is essential that education and training is provided to teachers to address problematic attitudes toward LGBTQ+ students so they can better support their LGBTQ+ students. Perhaps the most important factor is a lack of a representative curriculum. Currently, there are no national regulations or standards requiring LGBTQ+ related content to be included in teacher preparation programs; the inclusion of such content is dependent on individual schools, programs, and teacher educators (Clark & Kosciw, 2022). This is consistent with GLSEN survey results, regarding classroom teaching, where only 20.8 percent of students said they had been taught about LGBTQ+ people, history, or events in their classes even though being taught these topics is related to lower levels of victimization of LGBTQ+ students (Greytak et al., 2016). This is likely because the teaching of LGBTQ+ content is met with   10  opposition. This opposition can be seen currently in Florida where two laws have been enacted. H.R. 1557, known as the “Don’t Say Gay” law, bars classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity and H.R. 1467 mandates that all books found in schools and classrooms must be reviewed by a media specialist and not be deemed harmful to minors (2022). According to these laws, even mentioning LGBTQ+ topics in school can cause teachers to be reprimanded, or worse, fired. These laws are harmful to LGBTQ+ students and families and transform classrooms into unsafe spaces, which can intensify the issues that these students are already facing.  The banning of books has increased rapidly over the last few years causing the censorship of the LGBTQ+ community. In fact, books related to LGBTQ+ themes and identities are among the most frequently banned books in the United States (Clyde & Lobban, 2001). Books that include LGBTQ+ characters elicit a strong negative reaction by vocal conservative groups. The exclusion of LGBTQ+ themed books face such a strong negative stigma that despite their literary or social merit, their mere presence causes a high degree of self-censorship among school administrators, librarians, and teachers (Casement, 2020). The “Don’t Say Gay” bill illuminates the issue that the current movement to ban books is deeply undemocratic, as it seeks to impose restrictions on all students’ access to inclusive literature based on the preferences of a few parents or community members. The pushback on LGBTQ+ books elicits fear and silences the voices of writers, teachers, and students even though organizations like the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) issued a resolution to strengthen teacher knowledge of LGBTQ+ issues and called to produce instructional materials for students that address LGBTQ+ topics (NCTE, 2009). The lack of representation of LGBTQ+ children and families in literature and curriculum is harmful to students who hold these identities, and it reinforces the heterosexual   11  norm. Normalized homophobia, the lack of training for teachers on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the classroom, as well as the lack of LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum, creates an unsafe school environment for LGBTQ+ students.  Background of the Project History of LGBTQ+ Oppression Looking at the profound data surrounding the victimization of LGBTQ+ youth, one must ask how did schools in America get this way? From women not being allowed an education to the segregation and resegregation of US schools, the history of schooling in America has revealed injustices since its inception. Social perceptions of the LGBTQ+ community throughout the years have shaped the laws that are meant to discriminate, harm, and shadow LGBTQ+ people. In the 1960s it was considered a psychological disease and a crime to be gay. Gay men were devastatingly mistreated during the AIDS epidemic. The “Lavender Scare” purges of LGBTQ+ public employees during the McCarthy era showed substantial government intrusion into the lives of LGBTQ+ people. In more recent events, the enacting of the “Don’t Say Gay” laws by Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, encouraged the erasure of LGBTQ+ inclusive content in schools. These policy examples have all supported the mistreatment of the LGBTQ+ community. Shifting political control, the polarization of political parties, differing federal and state authority, and public opinion play a role in the oppression of the LGBTQ+ community.  The LGBTQ+ community has faced a long history of discrimination. Harbeck (1997), in their book, Gay and Lesbian Educators: Personal Freedoms, Public Constraints, examines gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender discrimination in American education, focusing on both at risk students and teachers. Harbeck (1997) explained that this discrimination is caused by conflicting state and federal mandates that schools must follow. For example, Title IX, a federal law,   12  ensures an equal learning environment to all students, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. However, in 2023 alone, 45 anti-LGBTQ+ laws have been enacted so far: some laws allowing the ill-treatment of LGBTQ+ students in schools (Peele, 2023). Although Title IX should protect students based on sexual orientation and gender identity, some state laws permit the opposite.  It is challenging to decide how to balance religious liberty and the liberty of LGBTQ+ people; two competing values in our pluralistic society. Weaponizing public policy has largely been driven by extremist groups and/or organizations (the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council) that have been deemed hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center (Peele, 2023). These groups have infringed upon the rights of the LGBTQ+ community by banning gender affirming care for transgender youth, allowing the misgendering of transgender youth in schools, targeting drag performances, censoring school curriculum, and more (Peele, 2023). These hate groups seek to advance the freedom of religion by defaming and restricting the rights of the LGBTQ+ community. According to Pizer et al. (2012), based on research conducted on sexual orientation and gender identity law and public policy, legal decisions are frequently evaluated based on moral frameworks, most often freedom of religion, a common justification of LGBTQ+ discrimination. These types of policies, although defending religious liberties, invite discrimination. These conflicting ideas are highlighted in current research regarding teacher attitudes that show teacher educators who teach at religious institutions believe LGBTQ+ inclusive content is less important for pre-service teachers to learn than those who teach at secular institutions (Clark & Kosciw, 2022). This highlights a need for administrators to combat discrimination by including LGBTQ+ content in schools and providing   13  specific policy and guidance on inclusion of LGBTQ+ issues, as well as other diversity and inclusion content. In recent history, conflicting state and federal policies have contributed to the discrimination of the LGBTQ+ community and created adverse environments in the workplace and schools. In their literature review, Duke (2007) examined the experiences of lesbian and gay educators and school personnel. In the 1990s to early 2000s, 41 states allowed school districts to refuse to hire and to fire lesbian and gay educators solely based on their sexual identity; this caused LGBTQ+ educators to fear losing their jobs if disclosing their sexual identity and prevented these educators from defending themselves, their gay and lesbian colleagues, and students (Duke, 2007). Fear among LGBTQ+ educators were high during George W. Bush’s presidency; members of Congress spoke openly against the hiring of LGBTQ+ teachers and President Bush pushed to fill federal court vacancies with conservative, anti-LGBTQ+ judges (Duke, 2007). Although discrimination against LGBT people has a negative impact on health, wages, job opportunities, productivity in the workplace, and job satisfaction, during the Bush Administration, nation-wide survey results indicated a hostile work environment for LGBT employees, which included LGBT employees being fired, denied employment or a promotion, and experiencing harassment and discrimination in the workplace (Pizer et al., 2012). Further, the negative environment for LGBTQ+ people during this time contributed to high suicide and drop-out rates among gay and lesbian youth and denied students positive LGBTQ+ role models (Harbeck, 1992). Restricting the rights of the LGBTQ+ community negatively impacts schools in the greater community. Although LGBTQ+ discrimination is still ubiquitous today, attitudes have changed over time. Further into the 2000s, the Obama Administration worked to advance the rights of   14  LGBTQ+ Americans. Their administration changed policy to: (1) protect LGBTQ+ Americans against discrimination and hate crimes; (2) support LGBTQ+ health by issuing a directive on same-sex partner benefits and banning conversion therapy; (3) repeal “Don’t’ Ask Don’t Tell; (4) end the Defense of Marriage Act’s (DOMA) provision defining marriage as only between a man and woman; (5) ensure LGBTQ+ equality in housing and crime prevention and more (Fact sheet, 2016). This led to the protection of millions of LGBTQ+ people, including educators and students. However, the climate shifted when the Trump Administration took office and levied against the LGBTQ+ community. The Trump Administration rolled back Obama’s non-discrimination protections, banned transgender service members and those living with HIV from serving in the military, eliminated Obama-era guidance on the treatment of LGBTQ+ students in schools, and established many limitations to health care, housing, representation, and safety in the workplace for LGBTQ+ people (HRC Staff, 2020). The policies opened the door to discrimination against LGBTQ+ students. In their study to understand more about the nature of civil rights complaints filed by LGBTQ+ students and how those complaints were handled by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) during the Trump Administration, Mirza and Bewkes (2019) found that the Department of Education dismissed or closed LGBTQ+ discrimination complaint cases without finding of wrongdoing at a rate of 91.5% compared to 65.4% during the Obama Administration (Mirza & Bewkes, 2019). Further, the Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, and the Department of Education refused to rule out federal funding for schools that violated federal law by discriminating against LGBTQ+ students and ruled that transgender youth participating in sports that aligned with their gender identity violated Title IX (HRC Staff, 2020). Protections for the LGBTQ+ community remain dependent on what politician or political party occupies office.     15  Victimization of LGBTQ+ Students LGBTQ+ students face unique challenges every day in schools across the nation. According to Paley (2020) and Greytak et al. (2016) in their surveys of LGBTQ+ youth across America, over half of LGBTQ+ students feel unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation and report symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Homophobic bullying is prevalent in schools; the term homophobia is a prejudice against individuals who identify or are perceived as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or LGBTQ+. A study by Orue and Calvete (2018) found that adolescents who maintain homophobic attitudes are more prone to carrying out homophobic bullying. Anti-LGBTQ+ victimization has a negative impact on health outcomes of LGBTQ+ students. LGBT youth experience higher rates of victimization than their non-LGBT peers, which often cause students to avoid school activities or miss school entirely, thus impacting educational outcomes (Russell & Horn, 2017; Greytak et a., 2016). Sixty percent of LGBTQ+ youth have experienced discrimination due to either their sexual orientation or gender identity, and only 13% of LGBTQ+ students reported hearing positive messages about being LGBTQ+ in schools (Miranda et al., 2018; Paley, 2020). Furthermore, this hostility has led to 40% of LGBTQ+ students to seriously considering attempting suicide and 48% of LGBTQ+ youth engaging in self-harm, 60% for transgender and nonbinary youth (Paley, 2020).  In their book, Sexual orientation, gender identity, and schooling: The nexus of research, practice, and policy, Russell and Horn (2017) looked at education and sexuality research on school safety, diversity, and development. In their research, they discuss how suicide is a public health crisis; suicide is consistently the second leading cause of death among young people and continues to disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ youth and students of color (Russell & Horn, 2017). This could be because some policies in schools are designed specifically in ways that   16  discriminate against LGBTQ+ students. This includes, gendered dress codes, rules regarding school dances, and selectively enforcing displays of physical attraction (Russel et al., 2010). Instead of simply creating a nondiscrimination policy to protect LGBTQ+ students from bullying, schools should review all their rules and policies to make sure they are inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming students. Studies prove that when schools implement an antibullying policy, it results in lower suicide and self-harm risk among LGBTQ+ students (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014; Russell & Horn, 2017). This suggests that when stakeholders at all levels engage in improving school climate, the effects are stronger. There is an essential need for data collection and mental health support for LGBTQ+ youth, as well as a better understanding of the interconnectedness among school climate and psychological well-being. The Passive Role of Educators and Administrators Teachers and administrators are in a unique position to ensure that their schools and districts have working anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation and gender identity. In the book, LGBTQ youth and education: Policies and practices, Mayo (2014) examines pedagogy, curriculum, and policy that must change to improve the schooling experiences for LGBTQ+ youth. Mayo (2014) found that allowing students access to an equitable and safe educational environment by providing physical and emotional safety from oppression, bullying, and microaggressions can help all students learn. Furthermore, school staff can ensure that discrimination policies are part of the educational experience of all students. Hall and Rodgers (2018), in their study of 305 PreK-12 teachers from 2006-2014, found that teachers can play a key role in students' school experiences and their attitudes about homosexuality can influence behavior toward LGBTQ+ students. However, a GLSEN survey found students were   17  least likely to report that staff intervened when hearing negative remarks about gender expression and sexual identity; only 18.5% reported that they intervened often or very often; and educators were least comfortable in their capacity to address anti-LGBTQ+ bias compared to all other biases studied (Greytak et al., 2016). A survey of U.S. teacher educators by Clark and Kosciw (2022) found that although teacher educators believed it was important for pre-service teachers to learn about LGBTQ+ topics and teaching strategies, teacher educators were not very confident in engaging in LGBTQ+ inclusive teaching or answering questions from their students about LGBTQ+ topics (Clark & Kosciw, 2022). The literature shows that many teachers do not feel comfortable discussing LGBTQ+ issues in the classroom; much work should be done to ensure teachers are trained properly to intervene in situations involving LGBTQ+ students and topics.  It is important for educators to be aware of the biases they hold and to learn more about how to address LGBTQ+ issues in school. Research indicates that teachers' attitudes toward homosexuality have become more promising over time; however, many teachers still hold negative attitudes (Hall & Rodgers, 2018). If teachers receive training on how to handle LGBTQ+ biases, they may feel more comfortable addressing them. Researchers have found it may be helpful to focus on educating preservice teachers. Mitton et al. (2021), in their multi-year study of pre-service teachers in one University in Canada, found that many pre-service teachers are not prepared to address classroom concerns regarding homophobia, heterosexism, and cisnormativity; fail to identify biases in curriculum; and resist ideas related to the intersectionality of race, class, ethnicity, gender, ability, and sexuality. The promising results of this study showed that this changed with explicit education on how to create safe and inclusive classrooms and schools for LGBTQ+ students (Mitton et al., 2021). However, it is important to   18  consider barriers when educating teachers. Clark and Kosciw (2022) summarized barriers for including LGBTQ+ content in pre-service teacher programs being, time constraints, lack of knowledge on LGBTQ+ content on behalf of the educator, student protesting when LGBTQ+ content was presented, and the local community or school district was too conservative. These barriers uncover an important truth: while preparing teachers in LGBTQ+ issues is important, for educators to feel comfortable addressing LGBTQ+ topics in the classroom, it is imperative to have support from administration.  One study by Payne and Smith (2018), which conducted research on school administrators who attended the Reduction of Stigma in Schools© professional development program, provides insight to the many ways school leaders resist, avoid, or block LGBTQ+ professional development for their staff and resist the conversations around the school’s responsibility to students and families. Findings showed that school leaders who resisted LGBTQ+ professional development claimed training was not relevant to their school contexts, the training would attract community backlash, the school board would not approve the training, or school personnel would not be interested in learning about LGBTQ+ students (Payne & Smith, 2018). Research by Fischer et al. (2017) focused on the importance of advocating for LGBTQ+ students and families, although support for these students is often faced with backlash. In the study, one school administrator in Illinois worked to develop policies to protect transgender and gender-nonconforming students. When initially presented to the school board, these policies were approved unanimously. However, because of backlash from religious organizations and community members, the district made the decision to dissolve the work of the LGBTQ+ supportive committee and protective policies, fire the administrator, and since then no additional efforts have been made at the district level to support transgender and gender-  19  nonconforming students, their families, or the educators trying to support them at school (Fischer et al., 2017). This level of community backlash is a real fear holding many school districts back on taking the side of promoting a safe and more inclusive environment for all students and families. In fact, this instead leads some schools base their decisions on public and/or religious opinion. As previously mentioned, freedom of religion in respect to LGBTQ+ acceptance is largely controversial. Schools must balance the rights of LGBTQ+ students with students’ freedom of religion, which in some cases reflects homophobic views. Although research and current events reveal that administrators and teachers face backlash for supporting an inclusive curriculum, non-discriminative policies, and LGBTQ+ students and families in general, one study described how these two opposing views can coexist in the classroom. Snapp et al. (2015) found that although students were able to articulate their religious views opposing same sex-couples, those students with religious beliefs were also able to say everyone deserves to be treated fairly regarding LGBTQ+ people. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects students from gender discrimination in educational programs and schools that receive federal funding. Schools are already obligated to provide protections to students under Title IV. However, if school personnel do not know about specific policies or put them into effect, then they do not have their fullest educative and intended impact. Based on the hostile environment for LGBTQ+ students in educational institutions, it is of key importance for administrators and school personnel to actively protect all students. This includes an inclusive curriculum, updating or creating anti-discrimination policies, and training teachers on LGBTQ+ issues. Implementing anti-bias curriculum and policies not only benefits the well-being and safety of LGBTQ+ students, but all students.    20  Supporting Families  Understanding professional obligations and communicating them with community members is a helpful way to start school-based conversations about LGBTQ+ students, allies, parenting, and the right to an education free from discrimination. Furthermore, examining the intersection of family-school-community in shaping children’s development is essential in understanding how to best support the well-being of LGBTQ+ students and students with LGBTQ+ family members. Research shows the importance of educating parents and involving the community to create allies. Ryan et al. (2010) looked at the impact of family acceptance and the health of LGBT youth. Findings show that greater family acceptance leads to positive mental and physical health for LGBT youth and acceptance can protect against depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation and behaviors (Ryan et al., 2010). It is important to understand how families can support the resilience and well-being of LGBTQ+ youth. Instead of avoiding LGBTQ+ topics and conversations, schools can partner with families to attend to how parents, peers, and other adults can be supportive to LGBTQ+ youth, especially those who experience victimization.  Along with creating community allies for students, it is also important for schools to ensure that LGBTQ+ parents are included and feel accepted in the school setting. Studies have found that children with LG parents experience more victimization than children with heterosexual parents and school climate is related to victimization because parents who reported a more negative school climate also reported more child victimization (Goldberg & Garcia, 2020; Kosciw & Diaz, 2008). This literature is important because victimization is harmful psychologically to LGBTQ+ students. This victimization reaches beyond students and extends to students with LGBTQ+ parents. Research suggests that, like their children, LGBT parents may   21  encounter exclusion and stigma. Kosciw and Diaz (2008) surveyed LGBT parents about their experiences with teachers, school personnel, and other parents. The survey found that more than half of parents reported various forms of exclusion from their children’s school communities and parents who reported higher levels of exclusion and mistreatment at school were less likely to be involved in volunteering at their children's school (Kosciw & Diaz, 2008). A study by Goldberg and Smith (2018) focused on 68 same-sex couples of adopted children in kindergarten and provided insight into the life of parents in the LGBTQ+ community. The study found that: (1) parents who perceived their communities as more homophobic reported higher levels of school-based involvement; (2) those who perceived lower levels of sexual orientation-related stigma at their children’s schools reported higher levels of school satisfaction; (3) parents who perceived lower levels of exclusion by other parents reported higher levels of school-based involvement and better relationships with teachers; and (4) parents who were very out and reported high levels of exclusion reported the lowest quality relationships with teachers (Goldberg & Smith, 2018). To increase school satisfaction and school involvement among LGBTQ+ parents, schools should work to understand, build relationships with, and include LGBTQ+ parents in school activities and decision making.  Social stigma regarding same-sex parents still exists. One study by Inverno et al. (2018) investigated beliefs and stereotypes on same-sex parenting. The study found existing prejudices toward same-sex couples’ inherent inability to parent and the well-being of children from same-sex parents, which caused same-sex parents to experience exclusion and mistreatment (Inverno et al., 2018). Contrary to these beliefs, “the caregiving styles of LGBTQ parents are very similar to those of heterosexual parents, and parents’ sexual orientation does not directly affect their children’s school performance, social development, or sexual orientation (Evans-Santiago & Lin,   22  2016, p. 2). It is important for schools to be educated on the stigmas that remain regarding same-sex parents to provide a more anti-bias learning environment for students and families. On the other hand, research shows that LGBT parents want to be and are involved in schools. GLSEN survey results indicate that LGBT parents often approach their children’s school early in the school year to lay the foundation for a positive school experience for their child(ren) and LGBT parents show high levels of school involvement overall (Greytak et al., 2016). LGBTQ+ families, just like mainstream families, want the same things: support and representation from schools to create safer environments for all children and to provide opportunities for children to feel pride in their identities (Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016) This research is valuable to professionals who work with families so they can understand the experiences of diverse families and ensure all families feel included in the educational process. Inclusive curriculum, policies, and practices positively affect LGBTQ+ students and other marginalized groups. Furthermore, their absence has an overwhelming negative impact on the health, safety, and well-being of LGBTQ+ students and other stakeholders. In an ideal situation, all children, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, would feel safe and represented in all classrooms. Differing beliefs and attitudes of LGBTQ+ individuals are multifaceted and come from many constructs of social knowledge (Horn, et al., 2008). According to research, teachers have an ethical responsibility to ensure that all students, regardless of sexual orientation, receive a quality education (Hall & Rodgers, 2018). Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 ensures every child, regardless of sex or sexual orientation, is entitled to an equal learning environment where physical and emotional safety is promoted (2018). But currently, schools are a hostile place for LGBTQ+ students and many districts are hesitant to implement curricula, policies, and practices that create a safe school climate for LGBTQ+ students and   23  families. Examining the experiences of LGBTQ+ students beyond the school walls to consider how the broader environment influences school safety for diverse populations of LGBTQ+ youth is essential to create a positive learning environment for all students (Kosciw et al., 2008). This project reveals the history of LGBTQ+ oppression, the victimization of LGBTQ+ students, the passivity of school educators and administrators, and the effects of negative social stigmas on LGBTQ+ families. The saying “it takes a village” could never be truer when seeing how all stakeholders play a role in the protection of LGBTQ+ students.  Statement of Purpose Promoting a Positive School Climate through Gay-Straight-Alliances The purpose of this project is to provide a guideline for creating safe and inclusive schools for LGBTQ+ students. Goals of this project include encouraging schools to start a Gender Sexuality Alliance, recommending implicit bias training for all school staff, and to outline ways to include LGBTQ+ literacy practices in the classroom. It is important for schools to create a safe school climate free from anti-LGBTQ+ talk and bullying. This can be done by starting a GSA: it is encouraged to identify a point person to initiate a GSA program in the school. According to Gower et al. (2017), a more supportive LGBTQ+ school climate can significantly lower odds of relational bullying victimization. This project will discuss the benefits of creating a safe school environment and make recommendations for districts to implement. Promoting a Positive School Climate through Implicit Bias Training Schools are well-positioned to create supportive school climates for LGBTQ+ youth. According to one study, Fantus and Newman (2020) explain that homophobia and transphobia cannot be ignored in schools and teachers should model acceptance. Instead of reinforcing the   24  heterosexual norm or making assumptions, teachers can take an inquiry approach by observing and asking questions about families; inquiring about LGBTQ+ children and families demonstrates support, and modeling this support in the classroom allows students to naturally follow the same acceptance (Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016). To accomplish this, it is essential for school staff to be aware of any implicit biases they may hold. An implicit bias is an attitude or internalized stereotype that affects an individual’s perceptions, actions, and decision making in an unconscious manner and often contributes to the unequal treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, age, disability, or other characteristic (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, 2023). Adequate preparation and training of teachers is an important mechanism to prevent bias-based bullying against LGBT youth (Gower et al., 2017). Teachers need resources on how to handle situations where anti-LGBTQ+ talk or bullying occur. Supportive practices are necessary for LGBTQ+ youth to feel safe in schools and teachers should be trained to appropriately address issues.  Promoting a Positive School Climate through Inclusive Literacy Incorporating LGBTQ+ inclusive literature and pedagogical strategies into the classroom is of key importance to creating a positive school environment. Schools should consider professional development opportunities to prepare teachers to use LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum and teaching pedagogy. Research shows that students feel safer and report less bullying when the overall school level of inclusive and supportive curricula is higher (Snapp et al., 2015). Further research demonstrates that students in schools using more supportive pedagogy, for example, including LGBTQ+ figures in curriculum, a key strategy for contesting heteronormativity, experienced significantly lower odds of relational bullying victimization, physical bullying perpetration, and sexual orientation-based bullying victimization than those in schools using   25  fewer practices (Gower et al., 2017). This project will provide resources for educators that will focus on the representation of and empowerment of the LGBTQ+ community by encouraging educators to use LGBTQ+ inclusive books and lead discussions that model acceptance of LGBTQ+ students, strategies which also prove effective in creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students (Fantus & Newman, 2020). Inclusive teaching practices and LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum can help establish a positive school climate for LGBTQ+ youth. Objectives of the Project By establishing professional learning opportunities and utilizing the recommended resources, teachers and school staff will be able to gain the tools needed to create a safe space for LGBTQ+ students to learn and flourish. The goal of this project is to not just learn about and how to protect LGBTQ+ students, but how to empower them. This project will allow readers to: • create a safe school environment for all students and families, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. • increase cultural competence by addressing implicit bias. • include LGBTQ+ literature and resources to promote an inclusive learning environment.  • implement teaching pedagogy that empowers LGBTQ+ students. This professional learning opportunity is important to all students and families, not just those who identify as LGBTQ+. Taking part in the recommended professional development training and utilizing the resources recommended can have a profound impact on the social, psychological, and physical safety of all students (Fantas & Newman, 2020). These resources allow schools to create a community of staff and students that embrace and celebrate diversity so that all students feel welcome at school.    26  Definitions of Terms Culture: Refers to a dynamic structure of social values, cognitive codes, behavior standards, perspectives of the world, and beliefs used to give order and meaning to our own lives and the lives of others (Gay, 2007). GSA: Gay-Straight Alliances, now known as Gender and Sexuality Alliances, are student-led organizations, assisted by supportive school faculty, that unite LGBTQ+ and allied youth; they focus on building community by addressing LGBTQ+ issues that impact them in their schools and communities (Mayo, 2014). Homophobia: The term homophobia is a prejudice against individuals who identify or are perceived as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, LGBTQ+ (Orue & Calvete, 2018). Implicit Bias: An attitude or internalized stereotype that affects an individual’s perception, action, or decision making in an unconscious manner and often contributes to unequal treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, age, disability, or other characteristic (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, 2023). Inclusion: The term inclusion refers to increasing learning and participation for all students. Inclusion involves valuing all students and staff equally, increasing the participation of students, and removing barriers to learning and participation (Booth & Ainscow, 2002). LGBTQ+: Abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and more communities. The abbreviation is often shortened to LGBT, LGBTQ, or LGBTQ+ to mean all of the communities included in the LGBTTTQQIAA (VandenBos, 2015).     27  Scope of Project It is important to recognize that there are many factors which compromise student achievement such as, exclusive district, state and national policies, economic status, home environment, the disproportionate funding of schools, biased curricula and educational resources adopted by schools, and much more, of which are not in the control of teachers. This project will empower teachers and administrators to create a learning environment based on what they can control: the way students are treated, the conversations happening in classrooms, the pedagogy used to empower students, and the acknowledgement of harmful behavior from staff and students. The scope of this project will focus on recommending professional development training for PK-12 teachers and school staff to promote a positive school environment for LGBTQ+ students. The long-term goal of this project, upon seeing positive changes within schools and communities, is to stop the anti-LGBTQ+ policies that are being introduced in states across the country.              28  Chapter Two: Literature Review Introduction Education in America is historically rooted in the oppression of marginalized groups. In the United States, protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ students bring forth much controversy and debate. LGBTQ+ students can be found within all racial, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious groups (Mayo, 2014). Furthermore, intersectionality is a key term to understand in the context of school and society. Because race, ethnicity, social class, ability, religion, immigration, and more impact sexual orientation and gender identity policies in schools, schools should take a comprehensive approach when reviewing policy and best practices (Russell & Horn, 2017). While there have been significant equitable political and social advances regarding sexual orientation and gender identity, current research, policy, and practice demonstrate there is still much work to do to reach actual equality. Federal policies such as Title VII and Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act have loosely included protections for non-heteronormative sexualities and genders (Noga-Styron et al., 2014; Russel et al., 2010; American Civil Liberties Union, 2021). However, states and individual school districts decide how to implement these policies; decisions are largely based on the best fit for their school and community culture and not the individual and diverse needs of all children. To create an inclusive learning environment that represents all students, schools should adopt policies, curricula, and practices that ensure the protection of and culturally responsive education that supports LGBTQ+ students and families.  This project focuses on the need for a more inclusive school environment that protects and empowers LGBTQ+ students. Therefore, this literature review concentrates on the connection between three theories: Culturally Relevant Teaching, Social Constructivism and Reader Response Theory. This section begins with a discussion of the theory and rationale   29  behind the three theories and their relevance to creating a more inclusive schooling environment for students. It continues with the research and rationale where the focus narrows to connecting Culturally Responsive Teaching to safe schools, implicit bias training, and LGBTQ+ inclusive literacy. Furthermore, the research and rationale will look at the importance of Social Constructivism and Reader Response Theory in providing LGBTQ+ inclusive literature and teaching practices to students. The chapter concludes with a summary of the main points raised throughout the literature review and a conclusions section that details the information gleaned from the literature and how it advises the overall project. Theory and Rationale Culturally Relevant Teaching  Much literature discusses the importance of providing a culturally relevant education to students. A common term, Culturally Relevant Teaching, is a conceptual framework coined by Gloria Ladson-Billings and Geneva Gay. According to Ladson-Billings (1995), Culturally Relevant Teaching, also known as Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, Culturally Relevant Education, or Cultural Responsiveness, must include, “an ability to develop students academically, a willingness to nurture and support cultural competence, and the development of sociopolitical or critical consciousness” (p. 483).  A culturally responsive theoretical perspective is necessary to address the growing disparity of racial, ethnic, and cultural characteristics of teachers and students. Furthermore, academic achievement for marginalized students can only happen when student culture is at the center of learning. Culturally Relevant Teaching connects students' cultural references to academic skills and concepts, builds on the knowledge and culture students bring to the classroom, engages students in critical reflection about their own lives and societies, facilitates students’ cultural competence so students learn about and develop pride in their own   30  and others’ cultures, and explicitly unmasks oppressive systems in the active pursuit of social justice for all (Aronson & Laughter, 2016). As society is always changing, so too should pedagogical strategies to include the experiences, cultural backgrounds, and identities of teachers and students.  Culturally Relevant Teaching focuses on improving relational competency. While America is commonly known as a “melting pot,” students tend to attend schools with peers that are more like them, than different. According to Gay (2007), we must teach students, “how to relate better with people from different ethnic, racial, cultural, language, and gender backgrounds. These relational competencies must encompass knowing, valuing, doing, caring, and sharing power, resources, and responsibilities” (p. 20). This knowledge can help students be better members of the multicultural society we live in.  To provide a safe and culturally relevant education to all students, it is important to understand that racial and social identities, including gender and sexuality, intersect. People have different sides of themselves known as an intersectional identity. This identity can create feelings of not quite belonging in one group or another. For example, a female disabled lesbian Muslim deals with ableism, homophobia, Islamophobia, racism, and sexism; even if there are no barriers to physically entering her place of work, she may enter and experience racism and Islamophobia from the white LGBTQ+ community. There is a need for schools to become more inclusive of all students and respect all parts of their identity.  Research connects Culturally Relevant Teaching to positive student educational outcomes such as school connectedness, learning, achievement, critical thinking, and agency; and more importantly, when racism is directly discussed, students’ racial biases diminish (Aronson & Laughter 2016; Gay, 2007, Sleeter & National Education Association, 2011).   31  Further research focusing on Culturally Relevant Teaching beyond race and ethnicity, found that implementing this framework can help schools and teachers to disrupt gender binaries, promote gender and sexual identities, and move toward gender and sexuality equity (Aronson & Laughter, 2020). This research shows the importance of extending Culturally Relevant Teaching and practices to the LGBTQ+ community. However, it must be recognized that there are challenges to promoting gender and sexuality equity because of larger structural issues and teachers’ lack of awareness or unpreparedness.  By using Culturally Relevant Teaching and implementing culturally relevant curriculum, teachers can begin to establish academic and social equity within the classroom. Unfortunately for our nation’s students, less than 7% of elementary school teachers have included curricular content on gender non-conformity (Greytak et al., 2016) although research shows that the presence of a culturally relevant curriculum allows students to feel safer and report less bullying (Snapp et al., 2015; Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016). While Gay focuses their work on African American students, it is important to acknowledge the benefit Culturally Relevant Teaching has on all minority groups. Gay (2007) claims that Culturally Relevant Pedagogy must seek to, “develop in students an intolerance for all kinds of oppression, discrimination, and exploitation, as well as the moral courage to act in promoting academic, social, cultural, and political justice among ethnic groups” (p. 214). Historically, on both sides, there has been tension between who should be included in curriculum, and now the answer is clear: everyone. The issue of inequity intersects many social constructs and the more marginalized groups that are included in the conversation of equity, the further the hands of justice and equality can reach.     32  Social Constructivism To understand the importance of inclusive literacy practices, we must first understand the development of learners. Social Constructivism, coined by Lev Vygotsky, demonstrates how learning takes place in a sociocultural environment. Because learning is socially situated, learners are active, social, and build knowledge based on personal experiences. Vygotsky established that human psychological developments are facilitated by culture and ultimately contingent on history and considered social interaction to be a central part of all human learning (Taber, 2020). The active construction of knowledge means students in the classroom setting should interact with other minds. Vygotsky believed that learning should lead development and be mediated by others who are further along in their own development; by engaging in this type of interaction, learners are able to internalize and take ownership of knowledge (Taber, 2020). These types of interactions can support communication and thinking for oneself, two characteristics that are essential to classroom discourse and literacy practices.   Because knowledge is constructed and not transmitted and learners are active and social, students should be encouraged to make discoveries, work with peers, and bring their own experiences of the world to learning. Vygotsky’s Social Constructivism theory is well known for the ideas of the zone of proximal development and scaffolding. All learners have a zone of actual development (ZAD) or set of competencies; outside of this ZAD lies all the things a learner cannot yet do (Taber, 2020). This looks like problems students cannot yet solve on their own or techniques that have not yet been mastered. Vygotsky’s work focused on the zone of proximal development (ZPD), which encompasses what the learner cannot yet do independently but is ready to do with support (Taber, 2020). The ZPD varies from student to student and shows what each student is ready to learn. Supporting student learning can happen through the notion of   33  scaffolding. Scaffolding is a structure that enables learners to succeed in mastering new skills; the teacher’s role in scaffolding is to move students along a learning sequence where the scaffolding is rich enough to take the learner through the task but is then gradually released as the student begins to internalize each component along the learning sequence (Taber, 2020). Students will not succeed at tasks given to them that are beyond their ZPD without the use of scaffolding. Teachers should consider what students know and experience and then build upon that knowledge. The use of scaffolding in this project is two-fold; both to scaffold the teachers’ knowledge of implicit bias and use of inclusionary practices, and for teachers to scaffold their learners’ literacy development. Reader Response Theory Another guiding theory of this project is Reader Response Theory. To understand the importance of creating an inclusive literacy environment for students, one must first understand the transaction between readers and text. Developed by Louise M. Rosenblatt, Reader Response Theory, also known as transactional reader response, stems from constructivism and positions readers as the driver of their own learning. According to Rosenblatt, reading is too often taught as an interaction where the text impresses its meaning on readers or the reader extracts meaning embedded in the text. In their book, The Reader, the Text, the Poem: The Transactional Theory of the Literary Work (1994), Rosenblatt argues that text is simply ink on paper until the reader transforms them into meaningful symbols, meaning there is reciprocity of co-creation in which the transaction occurs. In other words, text requires a reader to evoke meaning; the reader is responsible for making meaning of the marks on a page.  Reader Response Theory distinguishes between two kinds of reading: efferent and aesthetic. Efferent responses to reading are oriented toward reading to gain information where   34  aesthetic reading is personal, emotional, and the reader’s attention is centered on what they are living through during their interaction with the text (Rosenblatt, 1994). Whether a text is efferent, or aesthetic depends on the reader; while efferent reading occurs to obtain facts and aesthetic reading is subjective, it is important to note that all reader observations are valid as long as they are supported by the text. For example, Rosenblatt (1994) discusses two functions of a student in an English classroom. On one hand, ideas about the author's intentions and meaning are given by the teacher, assumed to be rooted in the text, and accepted by the reader; on the other hand, the reader reads the literature and reacts to it personally (Rosenblatt, 1994). A main goal of the transactional theory is to foster the aesthetic stance of students by allowing students to tap into personal experiences and use their own personal perspective to create meaning. Rosenblatt explains that the student “needs to be given the opportunity and the courage to approach literature personally” (p. 63). Teachers should allow students to interact with texts personally, which looks like allowing for more active engagement with texts that students are interested in. Approaching literature personally can also look like exchanging ideas with other students and the teacher, so the possibility of different interpretations of the same text can be explored (Rosenblatt, 1994). This can allow for more substantive classroom discussions and critical thinking. The goal of Reader Response Theory in this project is to promote the creation of a reading environment that is more inclusive to the many different backgrounds and experiences of students. This project also hopes to encourage teachers to provide literary experiences that are meaningful to students.       35  Research and Evaluation Creating Safe Schools A positive school climate models principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. These principles are embedded in the learning environment and promoted by staff and students through their behaviors and interactions as well as teaching materials and pedagogy (Fantus & Newman, 2020). Unfortunately, LGBTQ+ youth have not been afforded the same positive school climate as their non-LGBTQ+ peers. A positive school climate for LGBTQ+ youth is promoted through multilevel and reciprocal interventions that support social, psychological, and physical safety, not just for LGBTQ+ students, but for all students (Fantus & Newman, 2020). Research proves that schools can create a positive and supportive climate by implementing supports such as having a sexual/gender minority point person, displaying sexual/gender minority content in a positive and inclusive way, having a Gay–Straight Alliance, professional development around sexual/gender minority issues, and openly discussing bullying with students (Grower et al., 2017). In Grower’s (2017) study of high schools in Minnesota, LGBTQ+ students were less likely to be bullied in schools that used these supports; when schools used more than one supportive practice, both straight and LGBTQ+ students were bullied less (Grower et al., 2017). A more supportive LGBTQ+ school climate can significantly lower odds of relational bullying victimization (Grower et al., 2017). Schools are better positioned to combat bullying victimization when they take a preventative approach to creating a positive school environment rather than a reactive one.  One support mentioned in research by Grower et al. (2017) is having a Gay-Straight Alliance in schools. Gay-Straight Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSA) are a way for schools to promote a safe school environment for LGBTQ+ students. A GSA is an   36  organization that works to draw in diverse members, organize against several forms of bias, and provide publicity to issues that affect LGBTQ+ people (Mayo, 2014). GSA’s show that schools can have a significant impact on the school community because having a GSA in schools can improve the safety and climate for all students. Research suggests students who attend schools with GSAs report less bullying, harassment, substance use, and mental health problems, while experiencing greater feelings of safety, better grades, and school belongingness (Greytak et al., 2016; Poteat et al., 2011). One study compared schools with a GSA to schools who did not have a GSA. The study showed that students who did have a GSA in their school were less likely to hear homophobic remarks, hear “gay” used in a negative way, hear negative remarks about gender expression, and feel unsafe because of their sexual orientation; these schools also experienced lower levels of victimization related to sexual orientation and gender expression (Day et al., 2020; Greytak et al., 2016; Greaytak et al., 2016). Gay (2007) encourages educators to respond to the sense of belonging young students need, honor their human dignity, and promote their individual self-concepts by allowing students to engage in cultural competence, critical social consciousness, political activism, and responsible community membership. This type of community can be achieved through GSAs. GSAs can create cultural shifts, are reflective of supportive adults within the school, and challenge a normative climate of silence around LGBTQ+ issues.  Implicit Bias Training It’s important to state that a bias can be conscious or unconscious. It is possible to have an unconscious preference for or against an individual or group of people and not even know it. Bias and prejudice against LGBTQ+ students can be seen in school policies, curricular decisions, the language we speak, and more. When bias and prejudice exist, the school climate for   37  LGBTQ+ students becomes unsafe and bullying and harassment can result. According to Gay (2007): Teachers need to become competent and caring culturally responsive instructors for ethnically diverse students. However, this knowledge alone is not sufficient. It should be complimented with careful self-analyses of what teachers believe about the relationships among culture, ethnicity, and intellectual ability; the expectations they hold for students from different ethnic groups; and how their beliefs and expectations are manifested in instructional behaviors… One cannot start to solve a problem until it is identified and understood. If teachers do not know how their own cultural blinders can obstruct educational opportunities for students of color, they cannot locate feasible places, directions, and strategies for changing them. Therefore, a critical element of culturally responsive teaching is cultural self-awareness and consciousness-raising for teachers. (p.71) Becoming more knowledgeable about how one's own cultural biases can be forced upon others, whether purposefully or not, can help alleviate the suffering it causes to minority groups. Schools are obligated to educate teachers on the role of culture—their own and others—and how it functions in relationships with staff and students, the curriculum, school, and society.  The College of Engineering at UW-Madison in collaboration with Women in Science and Engineering Leadership Institute created an implicit bias workshop in response to reports made by students of harassment and an unwelcoming school environment. The training sought to improve the department’s climate, teach participants to identify biases, and provide strategies to reduce the impact of implicit bias on their actions. Findings from the study showed that after completing the workshop, participants were more aware of their own implicit biases, more   38  motivated to engage in bias-reduction strategies, and felt they had the self-efficacy to change their behavior regarding bias (Sheridan et al., 2019). Another study conducted by Harrison-Bernard et al. (2020) discussed the results following a professional development workshop that addressed diversity, equity, inclusion, and implicit bias. The goal of the professional development was to make faculty aware of their role in promoting an inclusive educational environment for all students, especially those who are underrepresented. The results of the Harrison-Bernard et al. (2020) study:  …indicated a statistically significant improvement in attendee knowledge of correctly identifying definitions of “implicit bias,” “status leveling,” “color-blind racial attitudes,” “tokenism,” and “failure to differentiate.” Additionally, by the end of the workshop, participants had a statistically significant increase in self-perceptions regarding the importance of improving diversity and recognizing biases and stereotypes in graduate education, knowing what to say when interacting with people from different cultures, and the ability to acknowledge bias when mentoring students from groups underrepresented in the biomedical field. (p. 286) Training faculty on how to implement an inclusive environment can help foster positive relationships between faculty and students, as well as increase the appreciation for embracing cultural diversity.  Studies find that positive school climates for LGBTQ+ youth should be promoted, teachers should be trained to create these environments, and adequate preparation and training of teachers are important mechanisms to prevent bias-based bullying against LGBT youth (Fantus & Newman, 2020; Gower et al., 2017; Snapp et al., 2015). Long-standing biases against the LGBTQ+ community must be recognized before lasting change can occur. Before schools can   39  address harassment and discrimination with enumerating policies, they must understand that it is essential to also address bias-related motives that underlie harassment because these are a major cause of elevated risk (Russell et al., 2012). Professional development opportunities on LGBTQ+ topics positively impact teacher behavior and their use of supportive practices (Greytak et al., 2016).  Biases show up in the books students read, the shows and movies they watch, the store aisles they walk down, and the language those around them use. In fact, babies as young as 6 months old demonstrate that they notice differences in skin color; toddlers notice and comment on gender and racial differences; at the age of 2, children use gender labels and learn the colors, which they start applying to skin color; at the age of 3, children ask questions about their own and others’ features, including racial identity, language, gender, and physical disabilities; and by age 4, children begin to show awareness of family structure and economic class differences (Derman-Sparks and Edwards, 2019; Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016). Although the United States is an increasingly diverse population, people tend to live in communities with others that are more like them than different, and many students go to school knowing little about people who are different from them. This can create cultural blindness. Schools have an educational duty to teach students how to relate better with people from different ethnic, racial, cultural, gender, and sexuality backgrounds. Implicit bias training for educators is necessary to help ensure a more diverse, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all students, especially those who identify as LGBTQ+. LGBTQ+ Inclusive Literacy: Books The culture of schooling has primarily been founded on European and middle-class origins, and students have been socialized into a prescribed way of learning how to read, write,   40  and think (Russel & Horn, 2017). The relationship between literacy and culture moves in concert; cultural diversity facilitates the acquisition and expression of language and literacy education influences and molds an individual's cultural identity (Gay, 2007). This places a great importance on culture being at the center of teaching practices for underrepresented students. Stories can be used as a tool to illustrate various social constructs, which provide a window into the outside world. Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop (1990), a professor of children’s literature at The Ohio State University coined the term “Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors.” Bishop explained that books can serve as mirrors which reflect one’s own culture, windows to help you see into the experiences of others, and sliding glass doors where readers can step into the world of characters who differ from them to experience understanding and empathy (Bishop, 2015).  In Essentials of Children's Literature (What's New in Literacy), Short et al. (2018) explain to readers that: Stories are thus much more than a book – they are the way our minds make sense of our lives and world…Stories provide a means of structuring and reflecting on our experiences. We tell our stories and invite others to consider our meanings and to construct their own meaning, as well as to better understand those experiences ourselves. We listen to others’ stories to try on another perspective or way of thinking about the world. (p. 5).  When classroom libraries are filled with books that are reflective of the diverse lives of the children in the classroom, they are given the opportunity to make sense of their own life. When libraries are filled with books that are representative of all people regardless of race, religion, class, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, et cetera, students are enabled to see the world and gain new perspectives.    41  Literature has long been documented as a powerful tool for readers to develop understandings of themselves and others (Rosenblatt, 1994). In an increasing multiracial and multicultural society, books can serve as mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors. When looking to include stories of LGBTQ+ people, LGBTQ+ inclusive literature can help create a more positive environment and healthy self-concept for students who are often marginalized in society (Clark & Blackburn, 2009; Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016; Snapp et al., 2015). When students read books where they see characters like themselves who are valued in the world, they feel a sense of belonging (Gay, 2007; Luecke, 2023). However, if LGBTQ+ students do not see themselves in class materials, such as picture books, they may develop a sense of isolation and feel that there is something wrong with them (Casement, 2002; Snapp et al., 2015). An inclusive curriculum should include diverse windows and mirrors for every student.  Not all children are exposed to differences in cultures, skin colors, religions, sexualities, genders, and other group differences. Inclusive books support students’ abilities to empathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse groups of peers (National Education Association Professional Education Portal, 2021). These skills are of critical importance in our multicultural, global society. Without diverse books, students who always see themselves represented can develop a false sense of what the world is really like. Also, books with diverse perspectives are critical to counteract the harm from characters consistently depicted stereotypically, which can rob people of dignity, make recognition of our inequality difficult, and emphasize differences over similarities (Luecke, 2021). For example, if a cisgender student reads an LGBTQ+ themed book, it can provide a “window” into the life of a gender diverse character, allowing them to develop a compassionate understanding or move through a “sliding glass door” into active empathy. When students read books about other identities and cultures, they can learn how other   42  people conduct themselves in the world, which can be an effective tool to foster their understanding and acceptance of other cultures. LGBTQ+ people, history, and events can be easily inserted into most content areas. However, the type of books presented and the way these books are introduced is important to consider. Educators should take time to identify if LGBTQ+ related content is present in their current curriculum so students can reflect on their own identities. This could include gender identity and expression and family diversity, including LGBTQ+ headed families. Throughout this discourse, it is tempting to see LGBTQ+ students positioned as victims. However, this project challenges the reader to see LGBTQ+ students beyond the lens of victimization. LGBTQ+ communities are vibrant, resilient, have long histories of resisting homophobia and transphobia, and are often on the front lines of social justice issues (Mayo, 2014). Because sexual and gender identity is so complex and is intersected by other variables such as race, ethnicity, religion, social class, and more, schools may need to look beyond a one-size-fits-all model of implementing inclusive literature. At times, educators’ efforts to be inclusive and supportive can lead to teaching topics in isolation or fragmentation. According to the National Education Association (2021): Isolation occurs when topics are taught without context and/or are positioned in such a way that they fail to connect to the big ideas of the topic being studied, such as when LGBTQ+ themes are only introduced during LGBTQ+ History Month (October) or LGBTQ+ Pride Month (June). Additional fragmentation occurs when educators include only lesbians or gay men to the exclusion of bisexual and transgender people, or when lessons fail to represent ethnic, racial, and other forms of diversity that exist among LGBTQ+ individuals. (p. 7)   43  Educators should look to include LGBTQ+ themed literature into all parts of the school day and throughout the entire school year, while paying attention to the sharing of LGBTQ+ book characters that intersect multiple forms of diversity. Educators can implement inclusivity in the classroom by diversifying the books students have access to.   Research shows that LGBTQ+ themed books are commonly found on banned books lists, not because of their merit or quality, but for the sake of being excluded from schools (Casement, 2002; Clyde & Lobban, 2001). Another problem with some LGBTQ+ themed literature is how LGBTQ+ characters are often portrayed as left out or positioned as dealing with stereotypical problems instead of being empowered. In one study, Lester (2014) examined 68 picture books with LGBTQ+ content and found many issues with the representation of LGBTQ+ characters. In the books, LGBTQ+ characters: (1) were more acceptable if they seemed less queer and more gender conforming; (2) were seen as problems by their communities and accepted only when they proved themselves worthy of acceptance in spite of their nonconformity; (3) were faced with hostility and often asked to bear the responsibility for advocating their own acceptance; and (4) presented with only two binary genders while gender-queer identities seemed nonexistent (Lester, 2014). These issues create a negative representation of the LGBTQ+ community. There should be a balance of both conflict-based and positive, empowering stories. LGBTQ+ characters should be seen as people with regular lives, but who also happen to be LGBTQ+. Using the framework of mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors for the books students read can help create a more positive environment and healthy self-awareness for LGBTQ+ students, while raising the awareness of everyone.      44  LGBTQ+ Representative Literacy: Discourse Students need the opportunity to actively bring their life experiences to a story and then bring the text to life through rich, interactive experiences (Rosenblatt, 1994). This can be done by using inclusive books to guide classroom discourse. Engaging with learning in this way can, “encourage and enable students to find their own voices, to contextualize issues in multiple cultural perspectives, to engage in more ways of knowing and thinking, and to become more active participants in shaping their own learning,” (Gay, 2007, p.36). Literature with gender diverse characters can provide significant scaffolding for bringing marginalized populations into the center (Leuke, 2021). In their study on student engagement with gender expansive literature, Leuke (2021) found that visibility of LGBTQ+ characters is essential for reader empowerment and understandings of self and others, and group dialogue can greatly contribute to children scaffolding each other socially and textually, as they enjoy and problematize books. Discussion of literature allows both individual and collective reader responses. Discourse builds on the participants’ lived experiences, emotional connections, and accumulated knowledge while bringing into focus the power of individual identity, knowledge, and personal experience which can impact how readers construct textual relevance (Rosenblatt, 1994). How students see themselves frames how they see characters; text to self-interactions are nourished by identity development. On the other hand, students who do not see themselves reflected in the books they read and are unable to find meaningful ways to connect with a character, plot, or setting and often make shallow, forced, or false connections (Leuke, 2021). According to Vygotsky, an effective teacher tries to work with a student's own thinking and shift it toward the target knowledge; this can be done by eliciting students’ own ideas and supporting the process of engaging students in active dialogue as they move towards   45  understanding (Taber, 2020). Teachers play an important role in encouraging the exchange of ideas. To elicit honest, intimate, and spontaneous reactions from students, Rosenblatt (1994) mentions students should feel a sense of security in the classroom and in their relationships with the teacher, so they know their response to literature is worth expressing and valued. One study explored how seven secondary English Language Arts teachers facilitated student engagement with LGBTQ+ related topics. In this study, Kavanaugh (2016) brought up an interesting point in their research; participants felt tension between a desire to make LGBTQ+ identity visible and a desire to offer LGBTQ+ students’ privacy, otherwise known as visibility–privacy tension. The study showed that creative pedagogical strategies, such as anonymity, can support teachers in preparing students to fully engage in public discourse in the classroom so that the stakes of participation are not higher for LGBTQ+ students than they are for heterosexual students (Kavanagh, 2016). While it is easy to lump all LGBTQ+ students together, it is important to note that educators and those making curricular decisions should attend to the unique individual needs of LGBTQ+ students within instructional practice.  The transaction between a text, the reader’s prior knowledge, and the context in which instruction is engaged helps readers construct deep meaning.  Gay (2007) explains: “As cultural mediators, teachers provide opportunities for students to engage in critical dialogue about conflicts among cultures and to analyze inconsistencies between mainstream cultural ideals/realities and those of different cultural systems. They help students clarify their ethnic identities, honor their cultures, develop positive cross ethnic and cross-cultural relationships, and avoid perpetuating prejudices, stereotypes, and racism. The goal is to create communities of culturally diverse learners who celebrate and   46  affirm each other and work collaboratively for their mutual success, where empowerment replaces powerlessness and oppression. (p. 43) Students need opportunities to engage with culturally relevant texts that evoke multiple perspectives. Readers of all identities should be affirmed in knowing they have an important role in classroom discourse. For these constructive conversations to take place, it is critical that teachers develop the skill and confidence to bring LGBTQ+ inclusive books into the classroom and curriculum in meaningful ways.  Summary A culturally responsive theoretical perspective is necessary to address a multicultural world. Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, according to Gay (2007), consists of culturally competent teachers who connect student learning with their different cultures to help students develop an intolerance for all kinds of oppression. This framework for teaching allows students to relate better to people of all backgrounds and helps students be better members of the diverse society they live in. Schools can play an active role in this process by creating safe schools that meet the needs of diverse learners, addressing implicit bias, and allowing students to actively engage with diverse, culturally relevant texts so all students and families are represented.  Vygotsky’s Social Constructivism Theory explains that learning is socially situated, and knowledge is constructed instead of transmitted. According to the theory, learning requires active engagement where learners utilize their personal experiences (Taber, 2020). Students should be encouraged to make personal and educational discoveries, collaborate with peers, and bring their personal experiences to learning. These practices lead to high-quality classroom literacy practices, such as class discussions, where students can build upon prior knowledge and experiences, compare them to the thinking of others, and develop their ability to think critically.   47  It is important to create a literacy environment that represents the diversity of all students and families. Rosenblatt’s (1994) Reader Response Theory, which stems from constructivism, encourages students to tap into their personal experiences to elicit meaning from the texts they are exposed to. Readers have different personal experiences which creates multiple perspectives or understandings of the same text. Because readers all have different backgrounds and experiences, it is important to expose readers to books that allow them to see themselves, see others, and build empathy for those who are different from them (Bishop, 2015). Building an inclusive literacy environment, within the walls of schools that are safe for LGBTQ+ students, can create a more meaningful literacy experience for all students.  A school environment that models diversity, equity, and inclusivity allows all students, especially those who identify as LGBTQ+, to feel safe and accepted. Currently, LGBTQ+ students experience a school environment that is hostile and unsafe (Greytak et al., 2016; Hall & Rodgers, 2018; Miranda et al., 2018; Paley, 2020; Poteat, 2011; Orue & Calvete, 2018; Russel et al., 2010). However, when schools promote environments where LGBTQ+ students are protected and empowered, these students are less likely to be bullied, self-harm, and commit suicide (Grower et al., 2017; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2014; Russell & Horn, 2017). To provide this type of environment, schools can create a GSA. Studies show schools with GSAs report less bullying, homophobic comments, substance use, and mental health problems, and greater feelings of safety, better grades, and school belongingness (Day et al., 2020; Greytak et al., 2016; Poteat et al., 2011). As mainstream literacy becomes more inclusive of LGBTQ+ people, families, and communities, school staff will need to address challenges posed by the introduction of   48  LGBTQ+ content. This means addressing implicit biases and how they influence the classroom and school environment. In a multicultural society, implicit bias training can help educators implement an inclusive academic environment, foster positive relationships between faculty and students, and increase the appreciation for embracing cultural diversity (Gay, 2007; Harrison-Bernard et al., 2020; Sheridan et al., 2019). While implicit bias training can be helpful, it should only be used within schools as part of a comprehensive strategy to identify specific problems and systems that can perpetuate bias.  Regarding literacy, readers should both see themselves, others, and move through sliding glass doors to become advocates (Bishop, 2015). LGBTQ+ inclusive literature should move beyond stories that focus on oppression and prioritize stories that model redemption, resistance, and empowerment of those historically marginalized. Allowing students to see themselves and other in books is beneficial, whereas it can be harmful to students who do not see themselves represented in texts. When classroom libraries are filled with books that are reflective of the lives of all children, they are given the opportunity to make sense of their lives and engage in more meaningful classroom dialogue. These discussions help students build student identity, increase learning, and develop and increased awareness and appreciation for others (Evans-Santiago & Lin, 2016, Gay, 2007; Rosenblatt 1994; Taber 2020). Conclusion  This project recognizes that historical oppression, discriminatory laws, the shift of political power, passive educational administrators and teachers, community bias, lack of an inclusive curriculum, and more all contribute to a hostile school environment for LGBTQ+ students and families. Research clearly shows that when schools provide a safe and inclusive environment, all students benefit, not just LGBTQ+ students. However, this environment needs   49  to be comprehensive. While this project focuses on creating safe schools, implicit bias training, and implementing an LGBTQ+ inclusive literacy environment, more research should be done, and school districts should carefully start to implement protective measures. These protective measures can include inclusive curriculum, comprehensive anti-bullying policies, building a community of allies, and staff training on behalf of LGBTQ+ students and all students who are impacted by bias and discrimination.  This literature review has shown that research supports creating safe schools, training school staff on implicit bias, and utilizing LGBTQ+ inclusive literacy practices. Implementing Culturally Relevant Teaching pedagogy can establish equity by creating a school system that respects the diversity of all students. Social Constructivism and Reader Response Theory prove to increase student comprehension and achievement, while allowing students to see themselves and others represented in curriculum. Therefore, reform must focus on implementing these structures into the classroom so that all students feel safe, represented, and valued in school. To accomplish this, this project will recommend that schools create a GSA, provide implicit bias training to all teachers and staff, and develop resources to encourage representative literature in classroom texts and discussions. Educators have a morally imperative and professional responsibility to provide a culturally responsive, inclusive, equitable, and diverse educational experience to all students.         50  Chapter Three: Project Description Introduction Reflecting the diversity of and ensuring a safe environment for all students regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity should be a main concern for schools today. The lack of representation of LGBTQ+ children and families in literature and curriculum is harmful to students who hold these identities and reinforces a heterosexual norm. Normalized homophobia, the lack of LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum, and the lack of training for teachers on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the classroom is creating an unsafe school environment for LGBTQ+ students. This chapter will outline resources for district administrators and teachers as they work to build a more suitable environment for LGBTQ+ students and families. That established, the goals of this project include: 1. Creating a safe school environment and increasing cultural competence for LGBTQ+ students and families by encouraging schools to: a. start a GSA. b. participate in implicit bias training. c. review resources that support and empower the LGBTQ+ community. 2. Promoting an inclusive learning environment by recommending:  a. LGBTQ+ inclusive texts.  b. LGBTQ+ inclusive discourse strategies.  c. ways to intervene with anti-LGBTQ+ behavior.  The project will also include evaluation tools for districts to check for growth and areas to improve. Finally, this section will discuss the process of implementation, as well as concluding remarks with additional recommendations for effective implementation.   51  Project Components  Creating a safe environment for LGBTQ+ students and utilizing LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum materials is proven to be associated with many benefits (Day et al., 2020; Greytak et al., 2016; Grower et al., 2017; Hatzenbuehler et al. 2014; Poteat et al. 2011) Russell & Horn, 2017). When school staff members are provided with training on addressing their implicit biases and how to support LGBTQ+ students, they create a safer and more inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students (Fantas & Newman, 2020; Grower et al., 2017; Harrison-Bernard et al., 2020; Russell et al., 2021; Sheridan et. al., 2019; Snapp et al., 2015). When teachers read books that represent the LGBTQ+ community, students can see themselves and others reflected in the text, which can empower readers and create empathy towards others (Bishop, 2015; Clark & Blackburn, 2009; Gay, 2007; Luecke, 2023; National Education Association Professional Education Portal, 2021; Rosenblatt, 1994; Short et al., 2018; Snapp et. al. 2015). When students can share their personal life experiences while participating in classrooms filled with rich literary discourse, more voices are heard and more complex ideas are unearthed (Gay, 2007; Luecke, 2023; Rosenblatt, 1994; Taber, 2020). Therefore, this project consists of professional training recommendations, ways to include the LGBTQ+ community in the literacy environment, and additional resources that are based on Culturally Relevant Teaching, Social Constructivism, and Reader Response Theory. This project is a set of different recommendations, guides, and resources that will help recognize and empower LGBTQ+ students, and all students.  Starting a GSA  The first component of this project is a recommendation for starting a GSA. Gender-Sexuality Alliances are proven to create a safer school environment with less bullying, substance abuse, and mental health problems and higher grades, feelings of safety, and sense of belonging   52  (Day et al., 2020; Greytak et al., 2016; Poteat et al. 2011). When creating a more inclusive school environment, schools should first seek ways in which they can represent the LGBTQ+ community. Therefore, the project will begin with a GSA Recommendation (Appendix A). The recommendation provided directs administrators and teachers to the GLSEN website where they can sign up to start a GSA and explore resources and activities associated with GSAs. GSAs work to provide support to students and educate the school and community about LGBTQ+ issues. Starting a GSA in schools creates a supportive environment for LGBTQ+ students, students perceived to be LGBTQ+, students with LGBTQ+ family or friends, students questioning their identity, or students who care about LGBTQ+ issues. Most importantly, GSAs allow LGBTQ+ students, straight students, and supportive faculty to work together on issues that affect all students such as bullying, harassment, and discrimination. If educators or administrators are wanting to be an ally but lack the knowledge to serve LGBTQ+ students, a further recommendation is provided in the guide. To learn more about LGBTQ+ issues, educators should complete the National Education Association (NEA) training: Safety, Bias, and LGBTQ+ Issues. GSAs are a great way for student voices to be heard and to identify supportive adult allies in the school community. Schools should utilize the recommendation in Appendix A to learn more about starting a GSA and consider signing up to start one in their school. Implicit Bias Training Although attitudes have improved over time, many teachers and students still hold negative views and biases towards the LGBTQ+ community (Clark & Blackburn, 2009; Clark & Kosciw, 2022; Greytak et al., 2016; Hall & Rodgers, 2018). Normalized homophobia in schools negatively impacts students’ sense of safety and belonging. Teachers play a key role in the school community since they have the power to influence student behaviors. Teacher support, or   53  lack-of, for LGBTQ+ students, can create either a hostile or supportive environment (Hall & Rodgers, 2018). Thus, it is fundamental that education and training is provided to teachers to address problematic attitudes toward LGBTQ+ students. The Implicit Bias Training Recommendation (Appendix B) directs school administrators and staff to the National Education Association (NEA) website where they can sign up for a one-hour, online training course. The NEA training is free and discusses topics such as, race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and religion. Further, the training discusses the importance of how our perceptions inform our understanding of the world, understanding microaggressions and stereotypes, and confronting microaggressions and stereotypes. Implicit bias training allows teachers to reflect on their pre-existing beliefs and attitudes regarding the LGBTQ+ community. Understanding and challenging personal perceptions can lead to fairer decision-making and create more inclusive and equitable environments. Failure to reflect on these beliefs and attitudes leaves LGBTQ+ students to feel unwelcome and disconnected from school.  LGBTQ+ Supportive Resources It is recommended that teachers and administrators continue to become knowledgeable by learning new information about the LGBTQ+ community as it continues to grow and as legislation continues to change. Professional training recommendations are followed by Further Practices for Inclusion for Administrators (Appendix C) and Further Practices for Inclusion for Teachers (Appendix D). The guide, like a checklist, encourages school staff to reflect on their current school or classroom environment, choose LGBTQ+ supportive items from the comprehensive list that best suit their students, and take action on the chosen items. Completing even one action item can create a safer environment for all students. Further resources to promote the safety of LGBTQ+ students are What Do You Say to ‘That’s So Gay’ & Other Anti-  54  LGBTQ+* Comments? (Appendix J) and a Classroom Poster: Stop Anti-LGBTQ+ Behavior (Appendix K). These resources can help teachers, administrators, and students gain the knowledge needed to stop anti-LGBTQ+ behavior in the moment, which can help decrease anti-LGBTQ+ talk and bullying. The poster can be modified to support all acts of aggression including racism, sexism, classism, ableism, et cetera, and should be modeled to students and posted throughout the school. These resources are a guide for administrators and teachers to follow to ensure a safe and supportive school and classroom environment for LGBTQ+ students. LGBTQ+ Inclusive Literacy Environment The project then challenges educators to create an LGBTQ+ inclusive learning environment. A GLSEN survey found that only 20.8 percent of students said they had been taught about LGBTQ+ people, history, or events in their classes (Greytak et al., 2016). Teachers can use LGBTQ+ Inclusive Text Recommendations – Picture Books (Appendix E) and LGBTQ+ Inclusive Text Recommendations – Young Adult Books (Appendix F) to create inclusive reading experiences for students. LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum is linked to less-hostile school experiences and increased feelings of connectedness to the school community (Greytak et al., 2016). LGBTQ+ inclusive texts should reflect the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community and teachers should use an anti-bias and culturally relevant lens when selecting texts for their classroom or lessons. This project includes Guidance for Selecting LGBTQ+ Inclusive Texts (Appendix G). Teachers can use this resource to select high quality LGBTQ+ inclusive literature. This will allow children to see themselves and their families reflected in literature and gain a realistic view into the lives of a diverse group of people. LGBTQ+ themed literature benefits all students by promoting inclusion and learning how to embrace people with diverse identities.   55   Next, the project moves from including LGBTQ+ literature to talking about it. The Social Constructivist Theory of learning connects the text, reader, and context. Participating in a social situation involving reading and thinking about texts allows students to draw upon the text, teacher, and other students to help them construct understanding and meaning (Taber, 2020). Teachers can utilize A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades Pre-K-5) (Appendix H) and A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades 6-12) (Appendix I) to create meaningful discourse around LGBTQ+ topics. The hope for this discourse guide as well as the other resources mentioned is to help teachers feel more comfortable and empowered to handle conversations they may not be used to having in the classroom. Students deserve to feel heard, represented, and valued; teachers should reflect deeply on how their beliefs, attitudes, and classroom environment effect students. By rethinking our approach to inclusionary practices within schools, we can ensure the safety and representation of all students, especially those who identify as LGBTQ+. Project Evaluation The main goal of this project is to first create a school environment that is safe for all students and families. Schools can recognize and empower LGBTQ+ students by creating a GSA. Further, it is necessary for schools to train teachers on how to address their implicit biases, so they do not impact instruction negatively for marginalized students. After a safe environment is established, then teachers and students can start to feel more comfortable when including LGBTQ+ inclusive books and discourse in the classroom. The success of this project in meeting its goal will be determined through reflection surveys from educators and administrators. Administrators can compare these reflections to the school climate surveys completed by students and other stakeholders within the school community.    56  According to research, teachers feel the least comfortable in addressing anti-LGBTQ+ bias and rarely intervene when they hear students make homophobic remarks (Clark & Kosciw, 2022; Greytak et al., 2016). Teachers and administrators are successful when they can position themselves as an ally to LGBTQ+ students. The Personal Evaluation for Teachers and Administrators (Appendix L) has two parts. First, teachers and administrators should complete the pre-implementation survey before utilizing any of the other resources mentioned in this project. Upon review and completion of the project components, teachers and administrators can then take the post-implementation survey to see if their attitudes and practice have changed. Next, the School Climate Survey (Appendix M) can be administered. This simple survey can be used to understand the perceptions of different stakeholders within the school community. It can be used as an activity to begin professional development for school staff or as a larger school climate assessment for staff, administration, students, and families. After reviewing results from the survey, administrators and/or teachers can utilize A Checklist for a Welcoming and Inclusive School Environment (Appendix N) that was reproduced with permissions from ©Human Rights Campaign Foundation Welcoming Schools. This checklist challenges schools to see if they are using inclusive language, stopping mean words and actions, using diverse books and images, and creating a safe school and classroom climate.  The final evaluation for this project is directed towards teachers and their classroom literacy environment and can also be extended to librarians or media specialists. The Literacy Reflection for Teachers (Appendix O) asks teachers to center their students, families, and the LGBTQ+ community when choosing books for their classroom library or lessons. This evaluation tool also helps teachers reflect on their classroom environment to ensure all students have equal access to a high-quality learning environment. For students to feel safe when   57  engaging in literacy in the classroom, teachers should establish a classroom community where students feel they belong. This includes representing the diverse children and families in our multicultural society and creating a space for students to reflect on texts and ask questions. Plans for Implementation Implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive practices into schools and classrooms will take time. Because this project focuses on not only changing classroom texts and resources, but community ideas and attitudes, change will not occur overnight. Because every school and community are different, it will likely be necessary to make changes and adjustments to this project to better suit the students, staff, and/or grade levels attended to. In addition to the process outlined in the Project Components section, the implementation of this project will be successful when dedicated teachers and administrators take the time to identify with and internalize the importance of creating an inclusive environment for LGBTQ+ students. First, administrators should review the project components and familiarize themselves with LGBTQ+ resources to understand a need for change. Then, administrators can decide what changes are to be made within the school community. Next, teachers can be recruited and trained with the provided resources. After that, for this plan to have a higher chance of success, students should be invited to be a part of the process. Creating a GSA in your school should serve as one of the first steps for implementation. Finally, a commitment to follow through with the changes should be established and kept by all participants.  One key limitation of this project is that for successful implementation to occur, stakeholders at all levels should engage in improving the school climate. As mentioned before, LGBTQ+ topics are met with great resistance. This resistance is seen in the banning of LGBTQ+ books, anti-LGBTQ+ laws, discriminating school policies, and more (Clyde & Lobban, 2001;   58  H.R. 1557, 2022; H.R. 1467, 2022; Russel et al., 2010). This means teachers and students can only be successful with this project if they have support from administrators, the community, and lawmakers. It is encouraged that teachers notify administration before utilizing the resources within this project.  Project Conclusions Education is the cornerstone of democracy. The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) argues that LGBTQ+ inclusion is integral to fair and democratic schooling in a diverse society (NCTE, 2009). As states and districts move to include LGBTQ+ people, families, and communities in curricular materials, it is important to address: (1) the ways LGBTQ+ students are marginalized; (2) the impact school climate has on LGBTQ+ students and teachers; and (3) the need for professional development opportunities for teachers to address personal biases and develop skills in facilitating classroom discourse around LGBTQ+ topics. Education can be a powerful tool in supporting LGBTQ+ students to reach their full democratic potential. However, this requires schools to reflect on not only what they are teaching, but how they are teaching.  Most of the literature used in this discourse discusses issues surrounding the education of LGBTQ+ students. More research should be done on the blending of discourses, this meaning, examining the systematic marginalization of women, people of color, LGBTQ+ communities, indigenous peoples, the poor, persons with disabilities, and many others. This essay also lacks an in depth-review of school policy, especially the unfair discipline of LGBTQ+ students and other marginalized groups. Further research should be done diligently and supports should be implemented delicately to support all students and their unique needs. Furthermore, much of the literature about LGBTQ+ youth has focused on the experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and its consequences. As mentioned in this project, this looks like higher rates of suicidal   59  thoughts and attempts, depression, and missing school and school-related activities. Less attention has been paid to the negative outcomes that a heteronormative, hostile school environment can have on LGBTQ+ to access to education, the ability to learn, and academic success. More research should be done on the interconnectedness of school climate, well-being, and academic achievement.             60  References American Civil Liberties Union. (2021).

GSAs help students find community and advocate for positive change within the school and community. GSAs typically function best when students have a supportive adult(s) taking part in the group. The adult’s role is to follow the desires and interests of the students and support them in thinking through what is needed to execute their goals. The link above provides information on how to get started in creating a GSA and how to sign up through GLSEN. Further Recommendation:  • Unsure on how to best serve your LGBTQ+ students? Visit the National Education Association website below for a professional development training opportunity on Safety, Bias, and LGBTQ+ Issues: https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/professional-learning/resources/safety-bias-lgtbq-issues                 Created by Kassidi Adams, 2023   71  Appendix B Implicit Bias Training Recommendation      72  Recommendation for Implicit Bias Training Program Name: Professional Learning: Implicit Bias, Stereotypes, & Microaggressions Website: https://www.nea.org/professional-excellence/professional-learning/resources/implicit-bias-stereotypes-microaggressions   *Access to the course is via learnupon.com Session Length: 1 hour Session Format: Online Summary: Implicit bias influences our thoughts, understandings, and actions. Everyone has implicit bias, and it is important to be aware of it. For those who work in the school setting, implicit bias can impact the way we treat students personally and academically. This training explains implicit bias, stereotypes, microaggressions and how they impact school climate. It also focuses on providing strategies to identify and confront implicit bias in yourself and others. Furthermore, this training will look at how culturally responsive education creates a positive school environment.   Further Recommendations:  • Complete the Implicit Association Test (IAT) from Harvard University https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html               Created by Kassidi Adams, 2023   73  Appendix C Further Practices for Inclusion - Administrators     74  Further Practices for Inclusion Administrators and District Leaders: • Attend professional development that specifically focuses on LGBTQ+ students, people, and families. • Consider district professional development training on Gender and LGBTQ+ Inclusivity. You can request a training at: https://welcomingschools.org/resources/professional-development-training • Communicate support for LGBTQ+ staff, students, and families at the start of the year. • Create comprehensive anti-bulling policies that specifically protect LGBTQ+ students. • Enforce dress codes equally among all students. • Ensure that school documents include gender inclusive language. • Designate a gender-neutral restroom for staff and students.  • Respect student privacy (for example: never reveal a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity without the student’s permission—even to the student’s family). • Establish a point-person in the school who has LGBTQ+ specific training. • Publicly praise staff members who actively promote an inclusive environment. • Encourage students to start a GSA. • Train teachers and students on what bullying is, how to report it, how to respond to it, and disciplinary measures for staff and students who bully. • Familiarize yourself with LGBTQ+ inclusive resources (see below) • Acknowledge LGBTQ+ celebrations such as: o Ally Week (September) o National Coming Out Day (October 11) o LGBTQ History Month (October) o No Name-Calling Week (January) o International Transgender Day of Visibility (March 31) o International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (May 17) o Pride Month (June) • Be prepared to share the justification behind your support, and your commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and respect for all. • Feeling uncomfortable talking about LGBTQ+ topics?

Boys line up here and girls line up there.). • Learn more about gender-inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns. • Interrupt anti-LGBTQ+ remarks or comments. • Model to students that words like “gay,” “lesbian,” and “transgender” are adjectives that describe real people in the community and should be used with respect, not to insult. • Be an ally to LGBTQ+ students. • Consider supporting a GSA. • Consider posting an ally sticker or poster in your classroom. • Feeling uncomfortable talking about LGBTQ+ topics?

When selecting texts to include in classroom libraries or to guide a lesson, consider the following questions: Story 1. Is the literature age appropriate? 2. Is the story interesting to children? 3. Will the stories encourage discussions? 4. Are children exposed to multiple perspectives and values? 5. Does the text promote understanding of our diverse society? 6. Does the story help increase cultural competency? 7. Will children see themselves represented in the texts? 8. Will the children see people who are different from them represented in the text? Literary Elements 1. Are there various conflicts for children to explore? 2. How are the conflicts resolved?  3. Do characters represent people from a variety of cultural groups? a. Is there diversity within cultural groups? 4. Is racial and cultural stereotyping avoided? a. Are cultural details accurate? b. Are females, males, and gender diverse characters all depicted in leadership roles? c. Are LGBTQ+ characters positioned as the victim or hero? 5. Is it evident that characters are portrayed positively? a. What characters are depicted as “good” and “bad?” 6. Are the characters relatable? 7. Is there a lesson to be learned? 8. Are different settings represented fairly? (urban, suburban, rural, etc.) 9. Is the cultural setting represented realistically? Picture Books 1. Is the language rich, yet comprehensible to children? 2. Do the text and images complement each other? 3. Are the illustrations age appropriate for the intended audience? 4. Are the people in the pictures diverse? 5. Are the images of characters realistic and genuine; do they represent all people accurately? 6. Do the pictures avoid stereotyping? Created by Kassidi Adams, 2023   87  Appendix H A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades PreK-12)      88  A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades Pre-K-5) Selecting Texts:  o Reflect on your class roster.  o Are any of your students or families a part of the LGBTQ+ community? o What LGBTQ+ members are missing from your classroom? o Utilize expert resources to identify appropriate LGBTQ+ inclusive books. o Pre-read the story before reading with students. This can allow you time to research information you are unfamiliar with.  Reading WITH Students: o Allow students to construct their own meanings while exploring texts.  o Affirm that all students’ ideas matter. Ask Open-Ended Questions o What is happening in this picture? o What do you think about… o Tell me why… o I wonder if… o How do you know…  Promote Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors: o How is (character) like you? o How is (character) different from you? o What does (character) teach us? o What is (character) feeling? o Can you remember a time in your life when…. (connect to story)? o How did you feel? o What did you do? o Who do you think this book is written for? o How can you accept someone different than you into our community? o What did you learn today that you didn’t know before? Active Facilitation: o Model active listening. o Paraphrase student comments or extend and elaborate on student comments.  o Link student ideas to the text. o Thank students for sharing. o Provide opportunities to share in smaller groups.   Created by Kassidi Adams, 2023   89  Appendix I A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades 6-12)     90  A Guide to Classroom Discourse on LGBTQ+ Sensitive Topics (Grades 6-12) General Rules for Classroom Discourse Allow for visibility: Be willing to name LGBTQ+ identity and make it open for discussion. It should not feel like a taboo topic.  Allow for privacy: Create an environment where LGBTQ+ students do not feel pressure to reveal their own LGBTQ+ identity and risk the hostility that often accompanies that disclosure. Allow for anonymity: Create opportunities for public discourse about LGBTQ+ topics without the sacrifice of LGBTQ+ individuals’ privacy. Establish Norms Goal: Students work together by publicly sharing and expanding on one another’s ideas to extend the meaning of the text beyond the page.   • Be explicit about students’ right to privacy and right to visibility in the classroom. • Value active listening o Be attentive & relaxed. o Listen without judging. o Be attentive to nonverbal communication. o Don’t interrupt. ▪ Wait for speaker to pause before asking a question or adding to the conversation. o Ask questions for understanding. o Don’t impose your “solutions.” • Respect one another’s views o Be open-minded. o Tolerate opposing viewpoints. o Avoid blame and speculation. o Avoid inflammatory or provoking language. o Criticize ideas, not individuals. • Keep the discussion focused. o Focus on ideas and content rather than on personal issues and people. o Commit to learning, not debating. • Express yourself clearly.  *It may be beneficial to spend some time exploring the characteristics of effective and ineffective discussions       91  Prompts to Encourage Sharing • Teachers can model personal disclosure (personal connections). • Encourage risk-taking and sharing. • Remind students their opinion is valued. • Allow for silence – when teachers model being comfortable with silence, students will become comfortable, too. • Create sentence stems to prompt conversations. o I (agree/disagree) with ____ because of ___ o It seems to me that__ _________ o I used to think____now I think____  Active Facilitation • Thank students for sharing. • Restate student comments. • Ask follow-up questions. o Be sure to ask permission to ask a follow-up question. • Ask for clarification. • Re-word questions posed by students. • Correct misinformation. • Connect comments to course content/texts.  Alternatives to Whole Class Discussions  • Graffiti Wall: Pose a question and have students respond on large chart paper.  • Quick Write: Pose a questions/prompt and give students a set amount of time to respond in a journal or on a piece of paper.  • Draw Response: Like a Quick Write, pose a question and allow students to draw a response. • Think-Pair-Share: Pose a question and allow students to discuss with a partner.  • Think-Pair-Square: Follow up Think-Pair-Share by having 2 sets of partners discuss their ideas, making a group of 4. o Extension: Facilitate smaller discussions among students before asking to share with the entire class.  • Web Discussion: Create a “web” by passing a ball of yarn each time a student connects and idea to another student’s reflection. • Create Questions: Have students ask their own questions instead of having them produce answers.   To Create Privacy: • Reflection journals • Letters to the teacher • Offer another supportive adult ally to talk to To Allow Anonymity: • Have students write questions on a notecard. • Create a survey and discuss results. • Anonymous exit slips  • Utilize an online discussion platform (Nearpod, Peardeck, etc.) to pose a question and allow students to respond anonymously.

Ask yourself the following questions:  Mirrors: o Who are the students on your class roster? o Who are their families? o What are they interested in? o What demographics do they make-up? Windows: o Who is not represented in your class? o What groups of people are missing? Sliding Glass Doors: o What group of people do my students need to empathize with? o Gender, class, religion, sexuality, race, ability etc. Regarding the LGBTQ+ Community: o Do I have books with LGBTQ+ characters? o Do I have books written by LGBTQ+ authors? o Are LGBTQ+ inclusive books easily accessible to students? o Do your literacy lessons avoid bias? o Do your literacy lessons and books include positive representations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) people, history, and events? o Are students able to access LGBTQ+ inclusive digital media and resources?  It is important to establish a learning community where students feel like they belong. When analyzing your classroom environment, ask yourself these questions:  o Do your signs, posters, and curricular materials include LGBTQ+ people or diverse faces and families? o Do you celebrate/discuss LGBTQ+ related events? o Are LGBTQ+ related materials incorporated throughout the school year and not just during times like Pride Month-June? o Do you intervene when you see/hear anti-LGBTQ+ behavior? o Do you utilize teachable moments to stop negative anti-LGBTQ+ behavior? o  Do you utilize teachable moments to educate about LGBTQ+ terminology, history, and current events? o Do you give students a chance to share when discussing LGBTQ+ topics? o Do your students feel safe when discussing LGBTQ+ topics?   105  o Do you use inclusive, non-gendered language? (For example, saying students or everyone instead of boys and girls.) o Do you avoid grouping students by gender? o Is there evidence that LGBTQ+ students are welcomed and accepted in your classroom? (For example, a pride sticker is posted in your classroom or posted classroom rules include respect for all students) Reflections: What other teaching strategies do you need to consider to make your classroom a safe, respectful, and inclusive learning space for all students? ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________   For some examples on LGBTQ+ inclusive lesson plans, visit the link below: https://welcomingschools.org/resources/lesson-plans-lgbtq-inclusive    Created by Kassidi Adams, 2023      106  Appendix P Permissions     107            ",

    "abstract": "This paper explores research that discusses the impact of a culturally responsive education and lack-of for LGBTQ+ students and recommends a solution to ensure all students are safe and represented in schools. The research cited varies in their definitions and uses of the term LGBTQ+. This paper will use the term LGBTQ+, an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and more communities; however, the abbreviation used in the referenced research may be shortened to LG, LGB, LGBT, or LGBTQ to reflect only specific communities included in LGBTTTQQIAAP (VandenBos, 2015). This paper will also focus on inclusion, which refers to increasing learning and participation for all students. Inclusion involves valuing all students and staff equally, increasing the participation of students, and removing barriers to learning and participation (Booth & Ainscow, 2002). Finally, this project will discuss the importance of anti-bias education through the lens of culturally relevant teaching. Anti-bias education refers to supporting children to develop: a confident sense of identity without needing to feel superior to others; an ease with human diversity; a sense of fairness and justice; the skills of empowerment; and the ability to stand up for themselves and for others (Derman-Sparks and Edwards, 2019). When using the terms anti-bias or LGBTQ+ inclusive, this paper does not wish to de-center race or ethnicity but rather focus on the role gender and sexuality play with the understanding that social identities are intersectional",
