After verifying that there was indeed very scant research into the attitudes and perceptions of African Americans on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality issues, the following research questions were developed:•\t\tFrom\twhere\tdo\tAfrican\tAmericans\tdevelop\ttheir\tbeliefs\ton sexuality? •\t\tWhat\tconcerns\tdo\tAfrican\tAmericans\thave\tabout\tgay\trights specifically or LGBT persons generally? •\t\tWhat\tare\tthe\tbest\tmessages/avenues\tfor\tbuilding\t African American support for positive progress on  these issues? •\t\tDo\tAfrican\tAmericans\tperceive\tthat\tadvances\tin\t LGBT rights could negatively affect the need for  greater progress on racial justice? How do we combat  the concept that there is only so much room for  advancement, and that African American and LGBT communities are competing for that room, as opposed to working together for expansive improvements for  all? Is this a major problem and obstacle to coalition building, or a minor one? •\t\tHow\tdo\tAfrican\tAmerican\tcommunities\tview\tgay\t and lesbian African Americans? •\t\tIs\tit\tpossible\tto\t“connect\tthe\tdots”\tand\tdevelop\t greater African American acceptance of LGBT rights  as a civil rights cause? The first component of the research consisted of  36 in-depth interviews conducted in November and  December\t2007.\tThe\tsecond\tcomponent\tconsisted\tof\t a national survey of 800 African Americans conducted  in early February 2008. Both of these components  were designed to assess African American attitudes and beliefs toward LGBT persons, and toward equality and discrimination issues for African Americans and for the LGBT community. The third component consisted of  six focus groups with African American respondents to test out the message findings by showing mocked-up direct-mail pieces developed as a result of the research.The final component, an online survey of 600 mostly white LGBT Americans, was completed at the end of  April 2008. This survey was designed to complement and, in some instances, to parallel the national survey  of African Americans conducted in February 2008.  The focus was to gather information on the attitudes  and perceptions of LGBT individuals as they relate  to some of the same issues from the earlier survey of African Americans: LGBT rights; discrimination issues  for African Americans, Latinos, and the LGBT community; and identifying ways in which African American and LGBT activists can work together to further their goals. The key findings and conclusions  from this multi-phased research are  as follows:•\t\tSolid\tmajorities\tof\tLGBT\tsurvey\trespondents\tand\t African American survey respondents agree that  “the\tbest\tway\tto\tdescribe\tthe\tstruggle\tfacing\tgays\t and\tlesbians”\tis\tto\tuse\tthe\tterm\t“equal\trights.”•\t\tMany\tAfrican\tAmericans\tsurveyed\tdefined\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tas\tspecifically\treferring\tto\tthe\tcivil\trights\tera of the 1950s through the 1970s, with its apex being the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. This association is so powerful that many respondents specifically referenced the rights gained in that era  (the right to vote and to eat in all restaurants) as  rights the LGBT community already enjoys. The  words\t“civil\trights”\thave\ta\tvery\tspecific\tmeaning\t for most African Americans, whereas many non- minority Americans use civil rights as a phrase  that is interchangeable with equal rights or  human rights.•\t\tA\tsolid\tmajority\tof\tAfrican\tAmerican\trespondents\t believe LGBT communities face discrimination on  a level close to that faced by African Americans  themselves.\tSixty\tpercent\tsay\tAfrican\tAmericans\t face\t“a\tlot”\tof\tdiscrimination,\tand\t52%\tsay\tgays\t and lesbians face a lot of discrimination. •\t\tWhile\tAfrican\tAmericans\tsurveyed\twould\tbe\tless\tlikely\tto support marriage equality than other Americans (67%\topposed)\tthis\tdoes\tnot\tmean\tthey\tare\tmore\t hostile to other LGBT equality issues.

It can instead exacerbate tensions by  suggesting that LGBT advocates are not willing to  respect or listen to African American definitions of  a term that is near and dear to them. •\t\tUse\tof\tthe\tterms\t“human\trights”\tor\t“equal\trights”\tcauses respondents to make positive associations such as\t“we\tare\tall\thuman”\tor\t“we\tare\tall\tequal.”\tUse\tof\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tcauses\tAfrican\tAmerican\trespondents\tto\tdescribe\thow\trace\tand\tsexual\torientation/gender\tidentity differ, and brings up negative connotations.•\t\tOlder\tAfrican\tAmericans,\tsoutherners,\tand\tthose\t who do not know any gay people tend to be less  supportive of LGBT equality than other African  Americans — demographic findings that parallel  nonminority variations. •\t\tGay\trights\tleaders\tand\torganizations\tare\tnot\tperceived\tas\thelping\tthe\tAfrican\tAmerican\tcommunity;\tonly\t14%\tsay\tthey\t“work\thard\tto\tsupport”\tAfrican\tAmericans;\t the average ranking for gay rights leaders on this point is lower than that for Christian conservatives or the U.S.\tCongress.•\t\tMany\tAfrican\tAmericans\tsurveyed\tappreciate\tthe\t nuances of religious and biblical language when they are\tused\tto\tcounter\tanti-LGBT\trhetoric:\t81%\tof\tsurvey\trespondents\tagreed\twith\tthe\tstatement,\t“My\treligious\tbackground teaches me that we are all children of  God who deserve love and compassion, and that includes\tgays\tand\tlesbians.”\tThe\tconcept\tof\tleaving\tjudgment up to God was also mentioned repeatedly.This research was designed and conducted as a joint effort between Donna Victoria of Victoria Research & Consulting and Cornell Belcher of Brilliant Corners Research & Strategies. Greater detail on the methodology can be found in  the Appendix. 4 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities A.  AFRICAn AmERICAn AnD LGBT OPInIOn On BEST TERmInOLOGy TO USEA great deal of discussion has centered around whether or\tnot\tto\tuse\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tin\tdiscussing\tthe\t advancement of LGBT equality, and in this narrative  we have decided to wade right into the question from  the outset. It is our measured opinion that, after this  extensive research and drawing on other sources, using the\tphrase\t“civil\trights”\tto\tdescribe\tthe\tstruggle\tfor\t LGBT equality detracts from having an effective message when communicating with African American audiences. What\tis\tso\tstriking\tis\tthat\tin\tthis\tresearch,\ta\tsolid\t majority of African Americans and a solid majority of white LGBT respondents feel exactly the same, as seen  in Figure 1 to the right.There were similar findings in the initial one-on-one phase of this research; African American participants were asked whether they would term the LGBT struggle “human\trights,\tequal\trights,\tor\tcivil\trights”\tand\tmost\t preferred\t“equal\trights”\tas\tthe\tterminology.\tThere\t is clearly a subset of African Americans who have  no\tproblem\tapplying\tthe\twords\t“civil\trights”\tto\tLGBT\t equality; in the qualitative and quantitative research,  they readily drew comparisons and saw this logic.  Unfortunately,\tthe\tresearch\talso\tshows\tthat\troughly\t a third of African Americans express very firm  opposition\tor\toffense\tto\tuse\tof\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\t by LGBT advocates. B.  ThE mEAnInG AnD EFFECT OF  USInG ThE WORDS “CIVIL RIGhTS”Use\tof\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tto\tdescribe\tthe\tLGBT\tstruggle has become a contentious and emotional issue on both sides. This research leads us to a very strong conclusion that it is not beneficial for LGBT groups  or\tspokespersons\tto\tclaim\tthe\tphrase\t“civil\trights”\tin\tadvancing LGBT equality for the following reasons:•\t\tAfrican\tAmericans\tdo\tnot\tdefine\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tas broadly meaning the struggle for equal treatment under\tthe\tlaw\tfor\tall\tpeople.\tFor\tmany,\t“civil\trights”\t is specifically the historic struggle of the civil rights  era — the period from the 1950s through the 1970s when great advancements for African Americans  were made in civic participation, legal rights, and  the chance to fully participate in the economy. There are many references in the verbatim responses we received to the specific issues facing African Americans at that time — civil rights is about the right to eat at  a restaurant, the right to vote, or the right to use a public restroom or other public accommodation.•\t\tWhen\tAfrican\tAmericans\thear\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tapplied to LGBT rights, they tend to focus on the dif-ferences between African Americans and LGBT people rather than on similarities and common ground.

A fight over the use of a term  that is less effective is simply that — a fight over  terminology. It takes away energy and resources  from the fight to actually secure equality.•\t\tSome\tLGBT\tadvocates\tseem\tto\tthink\tthat\tconnecting\tthe dots between the civil rights struggle of African Americans and the LGBT struggle will provide more strength or a shortcut to success if African Americans accept\tthe\tuse\tof\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights.”\tIn\tfact,\tin\tour\tonline\tsurvey\tof\twhite\tLGBT\tindividuals,\t88%\tof\trespondents\tagreed\twith\tthe\tstatement,\t“The\tAfrican\tAmerican and LGBT communities cannot truly work together\tuntil\tAfrican\tAmericans\tare\twilling\tto\trecognize\tand embrace the fact that gay rights and gay equality are\tpart\tof\tthe\tcivil\trights\tmovement.”\tThis\tresearch\timplies that African Americans are wary of this and feel that many other groups have simply tried to piggyback on the African American struggle. Again, what is meant to be a positive association with African Americans instead brings out negative associations.•\t\tSome\tLGBT\tadvocates\tuse\tthe\tdifferent\tphrases\tinter-changeably, a seemingly reasonable practice if it were not for the fact that African Americans describe a very unique and specific definition of the term “civil rights.” 1.  how African Americans Define Civil Rights When\tAfrican\tAmerican\trespondents\tcould\tqualify\tthe\t difference\tbetween\t“civil\trights”\tand\t“human\trights”\t or\t“equal\trights,”\tthe\tdiscrepancy\tlay\tin\tbeing\tdenied\tspecific legal rights — most notably the right to vote,  but\talso\tsegregation\tin\tbuses\tand\trestaurants.\tWhile\t the African Americans interviewed acknowledge that  the LGBT community suffers from discrimination, some noted that its members are not denied many of the basic rights that were at the heart of the civil rights movement leading to passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 — “they\tcan\tvote,\tcan’t\tthey?”\tMany\tAfrican\tAmericans\t tie\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tquite\tliterally\tto\tthe\tspecific\t set of rights dealt with in the Civil Rights Act, as seen  in the verbatim quotations below:Verbatim African American Responses to “Are these issues civil rights?”“ Civil rights are something that people worked hard for; people put their neck out on the line; people struggled for. mLK did not say ‘I have a dream that I see two men walking down the street’ … when you think of civil rights you don’t think of nothing but the struggle, especially if you’re black.”– Alabama, Male, Age 25-34“ The right to vote, and they have the right  to vote. So they’re not really being denied any, like, civil rights… now human rights are like if they ever got married, they get denied those same rights… They have  the same civil rights; they can use those. Because nowhere on a ballot does it say,  if you are homosexual you can’t vote.”– Alabama, Female, Age 18-24“ I think that when we talked about civil rights, back in the old days? Black people, minority people did not have a right to  anything. They did not even have a right  to a court. They were strictly second-class, or no citizens at all, even our history books did that. Even our Supreme Court judges did that. But when things came to a head  in the 60s, Johnson put forth his bill, all  of these rights, that the majority of people had, suddenly became everybody’s.”– Michigan, Male, Age 65+6 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities “ They still have opportunities to do things, they’re not totally denied anything. They may be looked at funny or something when they’re together, but they still can actually walk into a restaurant, sit down, and eat. When you’re dealing with the civil rights, mLK and all them, they marched, because we weren’t able — blacks had to go to  the back door; they couldn’t come to the front door.”– Alabama, Female, Age 25-34“ Well, when you say civil rights, I think about the 60s, I don’t think about gays… because that’s what it was labeled, the civil rights era, segregation and all that, so I don’t  associate that with gay rights at all. So  I just will say equal rights.”– Alabama, Female, Age 35-49“ Because I’ve heard a lot of…homosexual people on television saying things, that being gay is just like being black: they’re treated the same way; they have the same obstacles to overcome… The first time  I heard it, I was very offended, because  I heard it from a white man! And I’m think-ing, there’s absolutely no way that they’re the same! Because (every)time I walk  into a room, people know what I am. But until you tell someone, they don’t know.  So, that to me — maybe that’s how it feels to a gay person — that it’s the same thing like, but that to me is sort of an offensive statement… I think that even when a black gay male walks into a room, the first thing that people notice is that he’s black, not that he’s gay.”– Alabama, Female, Age 35-49“ It’s basically … well there’s a lot of differ-ence. Because in our struggle, which was going on over 200 years, and which was truly right before the eyes you could see, but now in their struggle for equality and human rights, their main concern seems  to me to be being together and getting  the same rights as a married couple.” – Alabama, Male, Age 65+“ my reaction to that is that, well as far  as employment and housing, a gay person has the right already to employment and housing. Unlike, a black person who’s  had to fight for it. See gay, in my opinion, is not something you can look at someone and tell. It’s out there only if you tell that to someone. So I can’t really equate that with a civil right, with something that people obviously (snap) pick up on like that.” – Alabama, Female, Age 35-49“ That’s an old story. I’ve heard that story  a lot, that they don’t want civil rights  compared to homosexual rights or lesbian rights. I’m of the camp that does not have problems with civil rights being extended  to gay people. I don’t think that they can  be separated. But I do have a problem when gay people say, ‘well this is just like when blacks were having problems with whites’. I have a problem with that… If you didn’t know what their preference was,  how can you discriminate against them. That’s how I’m able to separate this civil rights from that.” – Michigan, Male, Age 65+7 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American CommunitiesWhat\tis\talso\tevident\tfrom\tthe\tselected\tquotations\t is\tthat\tresistance\tto\tthe\tuse\tof\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\t is not about hostility toward LGBT people or a dispute with the central tenet of fair and equal treatment of  LGBT people; rather, African Americans are wary about describing\tLGBT\tequality\tas\t“civil\trights,”\tand\tinstead\t offer\tthe\tterms\t“human\trights”\tor\t“equal\trights”\tin\t their responses.The first of several unintended and undesirable forms that the discussion around terminology takes involves the\toft-repeated\tconcept\tthat\t“gayness”\tcan\tbe\thidden,\twhile skin color cannot. Conversely, when respondents were\tasked\twhat\t“human\trights”\tmeans\tto\tthem,\tthey\tinvariably\tsaid\tsomething\talong\tthe\tlines\tof\t“we\tare\tall\thuman.”\tFor\t“equal\trights”\tthe\tresponses\tleaned\ttoward\tthe idea that everyone deserves equal treatment, or that “we\tare\tall\tcreated\tequal.”\tBoth\tof\tthese\tphrases\tled\tto\ta positive association, as opposed to the mixed response and confusion evident when the LGBT movement tries  to claim the civil rights movement mantle. It should also be noted that this resistance is not  universal, as some respondents were more open to  an expansive definition of civil rights that includes  LGBT equality.Verbatim African American Responses to “Are these issues civil rights?”“ you know, even with that, a lot of people think that the civil rights are basically  just for black people and that’s not true.  It’s a misconception. I mean civil rights  was for everybody. The black person  happened to be the low man on the  totem pole that didn’t have any rights,  but I wouldn’t say it’s just their civil rights, or just their legal rights or whatever. But  at this juncture, I think it’s a struggle just  to be accepted, period.”– Maryland, Female, Age 65+“ I’d say their civil rights. I think that every-one has, according to the government,  everyone is created equal and everyone has the right to be able to conduct  themselves according to the Constitution, everyone has those abilities that are listed.”– Maryland, Male, Age 35-49“ It’s used for everybody. For the blacks, use it for the mexicans, use it for the Gay, Lesbian, Transgender or Bi(sexual)… LBJ signed it into law in 1964, I was a baby when that happened, now it’s up for  renewal… let’s add text about gay rights  to the civil rights package.”– Michigan, Male, Age 35-49“ In equal, I’m putting all of that under that umbrella: civil rights, equal rights would be the same to me in terms of, you couldn’t have equal rights if they weren’t under the law as well. When I think of civil rights, I’m not thinking of the march, but understand-ing that housing, employment, marriage all of that would be under equal rights.”– Maryland, Female, Age 50-64It\tis\timportant\tto\trealize,\thowever,\tthat\tthe\tAfrican\t Americans espousing the views above were the respon-dents who already support marriage equality and LGBT equality fully.

Role of Civil Rights Leaders and LGBT African AmericansThere are two groups that have the standing in the  African American community to carry on a unique  dialogue with other African Americans on LGBT issues: African American civil rights leaders and LGBT African Americans.\tWe\tknow\tthat\tmany\tcivil\trights\tleaders\t and\torganizations\tsupport\tLGBT\tequality\tand\thave\t no\thesitation\tusing\tthe\tphrase\t“civil\trights”\tto\tdescribe\tthis fight. Their support is invaluable; but again, we would not want them to direct their time and energies  to changing the prevalent African American definition  of civil rights when it would more useful to focus  on the issues at hand using language that instantly speaks to African Americans. On issues of ending  discrimination and inequality, many civil rights  movement leaders stand for and with the LGBT  equality movement. Individuals who identify as LGBT and African American may convey how the disconnect between equality for  African Americans and equality for LGBT persons is  irrational in their lives, and it is certainly their place  to do so. Their very existence bears witness for other African\tAmericans\ton\thow\t“the\tstruggle”\tapplies\tto\ttheir\tsexual\tidentity\tas\twell.\tWhile\tLGBT\tAfrican\tAmericans\thave to decide for themselves whether or not to confront the\tissue\tabout\tthe\tterm\t“civil\trights”\tdirectly\twith\t friends and family, white advocates are advised not  to take up this call even when they have the support  of some African Americans in their cause. Having an African American civil rights leader or an African  American LGBT advocate as part of your leadership  or group does not give blanket license to those who  are not African American to freely use the term “civil rights.” The speaker is part of the message; if that speaker at any given time is not African American,  use of the phrase “civil rights” is at the very least  counterproductive and may in fact be offensive.

The Concept of “Connecting the Dots” as a Shortcut to EqualityBecause the civil rights movement is so important to  African American history, many LGBT advocates make  the assumption that the way to reach and persuade  African Americans is to link LGBT issues to the civil  rights movement. Our data shows that this assumption  is\tincorrect.\tWhat\twe\thave\tobserved\tis\tthat\tthis\t“shortcut\tto\tequality”\ttactic\toften\tleads\tto\tinsensitivity\tto\tAfrican\tAmerican history and beliefs, and places the LGBT  movement\tin\tan\tunfavorable\t“comparison\tof\tinjustice”\tframework in which hard feelings are almost inevitable.LGBT advocates must be more aware of the historical context of the civil rights movement — they are not  the first interest group to try, and fail, at this tactic  of connecting the dots. Recently, immigration reform  advocates have run up against the same conundrum, finding that African Americans can also feel alienated from the language and appeals of the immigration  reform movement.1There is absolutely no progress to be made by comparing injustices — comparison inevitably leads to rankings  of injustice, and then to pointing out the differences  between groups that are all struggling for equality.  It is unproductive to engage in a conversation about whose history of wrongs is greater, yet that is where  these conversations often lead.1)  http://pewresearch .org/pubs/21/attitudes-toward-immigration-in-black-and-whiteKaufmann, K. m., 2002-08-28 “Perceived Zero-Sum Competition Between Urban Blacks and Latinos and the Prospects for Political Coalitions” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Boston Marriott Copley Place, Sheraton Boston & Hynes Convention Center, Boston, Massachusetts Online <PDF> . 2009-05-26 from http://www .allacademic .com/meta/p66058_index .htmlhan, E., 2005-09-01 “Competitions and Conflicts in multiracial Politics: Blacks, Latinos, and Asians in Los Angeles” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association,  Marriott Wardman Park, Omni Shoreham, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC Online <PDF> . 2009-05-25 from http://www .allacademic .com/meta/p41300_index .htmlCarey Jr., T., 2007-07-04 “Politics in Black and Brown: The Role of Economic Conditions on Black-Latino Conflict” Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Society of Political Psychology, Classical Chinese Garden, Portland, Oregon USA Online <PDF> . 2009-05-24 from http://www .allacademic .com/meta/p204560_index .html10 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities One of the most troubling aspects of the debate over  use\tof\tthe\tphrase\t“civil\trights”\tis\tthat\tit\tovershadows\t all the good news about African American attitudes.  There is an incredible amount of positive information gleaned from this research on how to communicate positively with African Americans, and on the common ground African Americans believe they do share with LGBT Americans. A.  ThERE IS PLEnTy  OF EqUALITy TO GO AROUnDOne of the first avenues to common ground and shared goals is the finding that simple self-interest is not a  conflict for most African Americans. African Americans  do not feel that LGBT progress toward equality will  impede progress or clout for African Americans. Only 33%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tin\tour\tsurvey\tagreed\twith\t a\tstatement\tthat\t“there\tis\tonly\tso\tmuch\troom\tfor\t progress\ton\tequal\trights”\tand\tthat\tLGBT\tgain\twould\t equal African American pain. In both the qualitative  and quantitative research, this concept simply had  no traction with African Americans.B.  AFRICAn AmERICAn  VIEWS On DISCRImInATIOnA singularly important finding from this research is that African Americans believe discrimination is a big problem for African Americans and for LGBT people in our society. When\tthe\tdiscussion\tturns\tto\tdiscrimination,\tthere\tis\tno\tneed for explanation or persuasion: African Americans  are right there with the LGBT community.Verbatim African American  Responses on LGBT Discrimination“ Because I’ve been discriminated against, for other reasons, and to me it’s live and  let live, you know. If this is what some- body else likes, why should you be trying  to change somebody else’s life. It’ll take  you six months to mind your business,  and six months to leave mine alone.  That’ll handle the whole year.”– Maryland, Male, Age 50-64“ I went and filed all kinds of complaints about this because it was wrong. If  anybody else wanted to take a shower,  they would have kept the shower curtain up. Don’t do that just because this man  is gay. And they looked at me funny cause you know I’m single and they thought  I was gay.”– Maryland, Male, Age 35-49 (n.b. This was a law enforcement officer describing harassment of another officer and his involvement in stopping it.)“ When you discriminate against people… they’re going to discriminate against  the gays now, the next thing is gonna be discrimination — well they do it anyway — they discriminate because people have certain diseases… If you start discriminat-ing against one group, the next day you’re gonna have a snowball reaction, and it’s gonna work down to everybody.”– Maryland, Female, Age 65+II. Building Bridges: Finding Common Ground11 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities“ I could not honestly say that I would be afraid of someone getting those rights… in fact I think everyone is entitled to, as our Constitution says, ‘certain inalienable rights,’ and I wouldn’t take that from gays or KKK or any other organization.”– Michigan, Male, Age 50-64“ I’m not going to sit up here and tell you what you can and can’t do… At the end of the day it’s discrimination. If brothers are discriminated against because they are gay, because they are black, in the end  it’s discrimination.”– Michigan, Male, Age 18-24“ I would not discriminate against them at  all. I’m against people being homosexual. I’m not going to discriminate against  someone because of the way that they  are. I’m against it; I’m definitely against it, but I’m not going to discriminate. I believe if someone can do a job, and they can  perform a job, then they should get the  job. It doesn’t matter what their sexual preference is, they should be able to get the job.”– Maryland, Male, Age 25-34While\tboth\tthe\tconcept\tand\tvery\tword\t“discrimination”\twork to highlight shared problems when communicat-ing to African Americans, we would note that research conducted by the Movement Advancement Project  (MAP)\tindicates\tthat\tuse\tof\tthe\tword\t“discrimination”\t is generally ineffective with white audiences, and that many African Americans do not equate the concept  of discrimination with the denial of marriage for  same-sex couples.1.  Views on Discrimination Against African Americans and LGBT People African American survey respondents were asked  about several groups and the degree to which they  face discrimination. As seen above, the answer in  their view is clearly that African Americans and LGBT people are discriminated against a lot.Sixty\tpercent\tof\trespondents\tfeel\tthat\tAfrican\tAmericans\tface\t“a\tlot”\tof\tdiscrimination\tin\tour\tsociety,\tbut\tthe\t figure\tfor\t“gays\tand\tlesbians”\tis\tnearly\tas\thigh,\twith\t 52%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tsaying\tgays\tand\tlesbians\talso\tface\t“a\tlot”\tof\tdiscrimination.\tEqually\ttelling\tis\tthe\tfact\t that no other racial, ethnic, or religious minority is seen as having the same degree of problems (respondents  were also asked to assess Latinos and Hispanics,  Arab Americans, Jewish Americans, and women).

Working Together = Strength in numbers, but Are LGBT Groups Working To Benefit African Americans?Another positive finding is that African Americans do  not hesitate when asked whether civil rights groups  or leaders should work together with LGBT groups.  Fifty-nine\tpercent\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tand\t93%\t of LGBT respondents feel that there is strength in  numbers if these entities start working together.There is a conundrum in that neither African  Americans nor LGBT respondents think that the LGBT rights movement has worked very hard to advance the  priorities\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans.\tSixty-two\tpercent\tof\t African\tAmericans\tand\t76%\tof\tLGBT\trespondents\tagreed\t with\tthe\tfollowing:\t“Gay\trights\tleaders\twant\tsupport\t from the African American community on their issues,  but it should be a two-way street; they have not worked very hard at all to advance the goals of the African American\tcommunity.”3.  Issues of Common GroundMarriage equality is one issue for which African  American support does indeed lag behind support from other demographic groups in this country; in our national survey,\t67%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\topposed\t“allowing\tgays\tand\tlesbians\tto\tlegally\tmarry,”\tat\ta\ttime\twhen\tpolls\tnationally showed opposition from all Americans to be about 10 percentage points lower than this.2 Once hate crimes or discrimination in housing and jobs are brought up, however, there is virtually no hesitation: nearly all African American respondents feel this is wrong and that everyone should work together to solve these problems. The strongest intersectional issues for building African American support are housing, job discrimination, hate crimes\tand\tbullying.\tWhile\ta\tfew\tAfrican\tAmerican\t participants did not believe LGBT people face housing  or job discrimination, most concurred that where it  exists, it is a logical place for groups to work together. Hate crimes are immediately, viscerally understood as  a problem for both African Americans and LGBT people; many participants noted that their first experience with  an LGBT person was witnessing someone get bullied  in school.51%56%45%51%■ Very big problem for African Americans   ■ Very big problem for Gays and LesbiansHousing discriminationJob/hiring discriminationAccess to benefits for unmarriedBullying in schoolsHate crimes41%42%50%35%48%34%“5” RATInGS ShOWnFIGURE 4: African American Opinion on Discrim-ination Problems Faced by African Americans and Gays and Lesbians“\tHere\tis\ta\tlist\tof\tways\tin\twhich\tpeople\tface\tdiscrimi-nation today.

These surveys were conducted in the spring of 2008; while the economy and job market were the top  priorities of both the African American and the LGBT  respondent pool, their priorities diverged sharply from there.\tA\tstartling\t40%\tof\tLGBT\trespondents\tsaid\tthat\ttheir\ttop\tnational\tissue\twas\t“equality\tand\tcivil\trights,”\tand\tanother\t22%\tchose\t“same-sex\tmarriage.”\tIn\t contrast,\tonly\tone\tin\t10\t(10%)\tAfrican\tAmericans\t chose\t“equality\tand\tcivil\trights”\tas\tone\tof\ttheir\ttop\t two\tpriorities,\tand\tonly\t4%\tchose\tsame-sex\tmarriage.\tWhen\tplanning\ta\tmessage\tto\ta\tbroad\taudience\tof\t African Americans, it is important to note that these  issues have far lower relative importance for African Americans than they do for LGBT people. A.  ThE FAmILy AnD COmmUnITyFamily ties are a source of strength for many, but  African Americans in particular place family as a  central force in their lives. One interesting finding in  this research was how often African American partici-pants talked about learning tolerance from their mothers. In some instances, we even had mothers telling us how they had schooled their children not to judge people.  This part of the African American experience — that of parents\t“preparing”\ttheir\tchildren\tfor\tdiscrimination\tand\tinjustice by cautioning them against judging others on  appearances — is clearly a survival mechanism, but it  is also a powerful avenue for exploring ways to develop  a resonant message for African Americans, one that  picks up on the lessons learned in childhood.Verbatim African American  Responses Regarding Family  Teachings on Tolerance“ my mother used to preach to me that there was nothing wrong with a gay person, if you had a gay person as your friend, you had a friend for life.”– Michigan, Male, Age 65+“ Oh my mother. my mother told me that everyone has their own path and their own life to live, and if that’s that person’s choice, everyone has a choice that they have to make in life.”– Maryland, Male, Age 35-49“ mainly, I give credit to my mother… She was the type of person that, whatever she could do for you, she didn’t sit back and judge — criticize a person because you were this way, or that way.”– Alabama, Male, Age 65+“ But like I said, my mother always, even when I was 4 or 5 years old, (said) ‘you’re no better, you’re no worse than anybody.’ We are all the same, we try to do the  same things, we all try to push forward  the same.”– Maryland, Male, Age 35-49“ my dad is pretty much ‘ok, that’s what  you want to do, well, we’re going to go along.’ That was his whole thing, not  getting upset. I try not to get upset very easily… you can’t force nobody to do  anything, if they choose to do that, or if that’s what they want to do…”– Alabama, Female, Age 25-34“ I would just let them know that they are partners and they love each other and they decided to be with one another. Like that, because I would like to raise my girls to respect people’s decisions, that how I raise them, and to have an open mind.”– Alabama, Male, Age 25-34III. General Issue Priorities for African Americans15 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities“ Just like I told my son, ‘you can’t do that. you can’t hate a person because of the  way they are…’ he overcame it after a while, you know, and I told him how God loves everyone. God created us all, and  the choices that we make in life, you know, we have consequences, however, that’s  the choice that he has chosen right now… but you can’t hate him for that, you can’t dislike him. you have to accept people for the way they are.”– Alabama, Female, Age 50-64Several\tother\tissues\tabout\tfamily\tand\tcommunity\t were raised in this research but had less than  conclusive results. Participants had very little to say  on the subject of African American LGBT people, and  no one expressed the view that African Americans or members\tof\tracial/ethnic\tminorities\tare\tless\tlikely\tto\t be gay. African Americans do, however, view LGBT  rights\torganizations\tas\tlargely\tnon-inclusive\tgroups,\t which creates greater distance between African  American and LGBT equality proponents. The notion that gay men might be seen by African  American women as competing for potential mates  is not supported by the research, and our participants  did not draw a comparison between African Americans and LGBT people being two groups with high levels  of domestic partnership or unmarried partners, which could lead to common goals on health care and pension benefits, or on hospital visitation rights.B.  ThE ChURChIt is well documented that African Americans attend church more often and describe themselves as more religious than other Americans.3 It is thus not surpris-ing at all that religion is an important, though complex, part of the equation for African American views on  LGBT issues. African Americans readily turn to the Bible and religious language first and foremost in discussions of\tLGBT\tissues\tand\tespecially\tmarriage.\tWhile\tthere\tis\t a\ttendency\tto\ttalk\tabout\tsin,\t“one\tman/one\twoman,”\tand\tother items claimed to have come directly from the Bible, at the same time, there was a surprising amount of savvy and skeptical discussion in qualitative interviews about how one piece of scripture may contradict another or  allow another view on an issue, and about the motivations of respondents’ own ministers when they preach against homosexuality.\tSeventy\tpercent\tof\tsurvey\trespondents\tsaid they did not rely on their ministers’ views when  they\tmake\tpolitical\tdecisions\t“about\twhether\tthings\tlike\tgay\tmarriage\tshould\tbe\tlegal.”\tThe\tpushback\tevinced\t by African Americans when they disagree with their ministers is illuminating but should not be construed as license\tfor\tLGBT\tadvocates\tto\tcriticize\tthe\tBlack\tchurch.\tWhat\tis\tuseful\tis\tto\tnote\tthat\tAfrican\tAmericans\tare\tfar\tmore likely to be familiar with the Bible, to read it regu-larly, and thus, to be able to make nuanced judgments about whether scripture supports or opposes a certain political or moral position.Verbatim African American  Responses to “When your minister says homosexuality is wrong…”“ he can’t give me his opinion, because  I got my own. he can tell me as far as…  (but you don’t believe him when he says  it’s wrong?) no, I’ve got my own opinion  — he can say it’s wrong, but when he  talks to me from the Bible, that’s what I’m forming my opinion on.”– Alabama, Male, Age 65+“ Love everybody. That’s the key. The Bible may talk about men should not lay down with men, but it also says ‘Love everybody.’ They can take that and turn it any way they want. There are a lot of ministers who are gay. That’s kinda surprising.”– Michigan, Male, Age 65+3)  http://pewforum .org/docs/?DocID=38916 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities “ What does he have to do with the way  I feel? he’s just a minister. I’m entitled  to what I feel, my opinion. he has his;  I have mine. he gonna kick me out of  the church?”– Maryland, Female, Age 35-49“ She asks each individual member about that. And I told her the same thing, I do believe that a man and a woman should be bonded together, but I also believe that God gives every person the free will, the right to choose. And let God, I tell everyone this, let God make that decision. And  they say, ‘Well, they’re not gonna go into heaven.’ And I say let God — if God can put two prisoners on a cross into heaven, well, then let God, let him make that decision.”– Maryland, Male, Age 35-49“ I told him, ‘Reverend, do you think that’s the right attitude for you to have as a  minister?’ I said, ‘you should be trying  to show them maybe another way of life,’ and he said, ‘Well I’ll tell you what Sister  L – –, even God has given up on them,  I can show it to you in the Bible.’ I said,  ‘I don’t think so. Because if God gives  up on any of us, we’re all in trouble. God doesn’t ever give up on any of us.”– Alabama, Female, Age 50-64“ They are opposed, including mine.  harshly. And I totally disagree with that…I don’t go to church as much as I used to… Because of some of the things that they say…what they’ve done has basically driven me away.”– Maryland, Male, Age 65+17 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American CommunitiesAs\tmentioned\tearlier,\t“discrimination”\tis\tunifying\t language for African Americans and the LGBT movement. Unlike\twhite\taudiences,\tfighting\tdiscrimination\tis\thard-wired for African Americans and immediately gets their attention. The survey results clearly indicate that African Americans believe LGBT people, even more so than other groups, face real problems with discrimination. This is a huge advantage in bringing African Americans along in their\tsupport\tfor\tfairness\tand\tequality\tfor\tLGBT\tcitizens.\tUnlike\tthe\tissue\tof\tthe\tuse\tof\tthe\tphrase\t“civil\trights,”\tno\tone\tvoices\tany\tconcerns\tabout\t“discrimination”\tbeing\tthe\tappropriate term for unequal treatment of LGBT people.The final segment of this research consisted of six focus groups with various African American audiences in order to test some sample direct-mail pieces for a fictitious “Treat\tEveryone\tFairly”\tcampaign.\tThe\tfocus\tgroups\t were conducted in late March and early April 2008  in\tDetroit,\tMI,\tGreenbelt,\tMD,\tand\tJacksonville,\tFL.\tThese locations were selected because they could provide significant regional diversity while still allowing access to large,\tdiverse\tAfrican\tAmerican\tcommunities.\tWest\tCoast\tlocations were considered, but due to the prominence  of the Proposition 8 campaign in California and relatively small African American populations in other western states,\tthis\twas\trejected.\tAccording\tto\tthe\t2000\tU.S.\tCensus,\tonly\t8.9%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tlive\tin\tthe\tWest\tcensus\tquadrant,\twhile\t54.8%\tof\tall African Americans reside\tin\tthe\tSouth\t(Source:\tU.S.\tCensus\tBureau,\t Census\t2000\tRedistricting\tData).\tThe\tgroups\tserved\t as a way to test communication pieces developed  from the results of the first research components:  the in-depth interviews and the national surveys.While\tqualitative\tresearch\tsuch\tas\tfocus\tgroups\t cannot be projected to a broader universe, they are  an important tool for testing imagery and detecting  nuances in public opinion. The results can provide  direction on how a broader group feels, thinks, or  talks\tabout\ta\tparticular\tissue.\tWhen\ttalking\tabout\t issues involving race, religion, and human sexuality,  it is advisable to keep focus groups as homogeneous  as possible; for that reason, groups were segmented  by gender, age, education and church attendance.Overall, we tested eight pieces and asked participants  to rank each piece from 1 to 10: 1 being the least  persuasive or agreeable and 10 being the most  persuasive or agreeable. One piece, Hate, was the most well-received, with an average rating of 8.27  out of 10. Four pieces were relatively persuasive:  Stand (7.85), Ask/Tell (7.69), Family (7.59) and Judge (7.49).

There are several ways in which communicating with  African Americans can differ from communicating with other groups: one is in the use of religious language  and imagery, and the second is an emphasis on strong family bonds and loyalty.Clearly, religion is an area that can cut both ways on LGBT equality, but thus far opponents have mostly  used it as a bludgeon, and LGBT advocates have not  addressed religion adequately. Legal LGBT equality  can exist in harmony with churches even if their faith tenets are exclusionary; marriage equality is about  civil marriage, yet a distressing number of Americans  still persist in the false belief that all faiths and  religions will somehow be forced to accept and  perform these marriages. In our national survey,  34%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tagreed\twith\tthe\tstatement\t “if\tgay\tmarriage\tis\tlegal,\tmy\tchurch\twill\thave\tto\tperform\tthese\tmarriage\tceremonies.”\tAnother\t9%\twere\tunsure,\t so\tan\tunacceptable\t43%\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tare\tnot\tclear on this issue.•\t\tIn\tmessages\tdeveloped\tfor\tAfrican\tAmerican\taudiences,\t the main focus on religion should draw on more tolerant, inclusive and loving attitudes expressed in scripture or other religious teaching. By far the most powerful language\ttested\twas\tthe\tphrase\t“judge\tnot\tlest\tye\tbe\tjudged,”\twhich\twas\twell\treceived\tin\tour\tmail\tpiece\ttesting and came up frequently in respondents’ own arguments. In contrast, it is ineffective to tell African Americans that their minister is simply wrong when preaching against same-sex marriage. It is more  effective to draw on other nuances of faith, and this phrase about not judging is repeated time and again. •\t\tAnother\tphrase\tthat\tsuccessfully\tdraws\ton\treligious\tthemes\tis\tthe\tfollowing:\t“My\treligious\tbackground\tteaches me that we are all children of God who  deserve love and compassion, and that includes gays and\tlesbians.”\tEighty-one\tpercent\tof\tAfrican\tAmericans\tagreed\twith\tthis\tstatement,\t67%\tagreed\tstrongly.The African American family really came to the  forefront in these evaluations, with the strongest pieces consistently being the ones that show African American parents.\tIn\t“Hate,”\ta\tfather\tis\tat\tthe\tbedside\tof\tan\tinjured\tson, victim of an LGBT hate crime, which draws both on the African American belief that hate crimes are a serious issue for LGBT Americans and on sympathy for family. “Family”\tshows\ta\tmother\twith\ta\tsmall\tchild.\tThese\twere\tthe top-rated of the eight mail pieces developed. Another positively received piece shows two women, in what  was assumed to be a mother-daughter relationship, with the\theadline\t“Family\tis\tthe\tmost\timportant\tthing.”\tThis\tpiece produced wonderful discussions on loving a gay child, the struggle to accept family and stick by them, and identifying with other family members closing ranks around one of their own, whatever the situation.20 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities hATEThe most persuasive piece overall, Hate, with a score of 8.27 out of 10, focuses on a man who had been attacked for being gay. Hate crimes and bullying are without fail one of the most persuasive bridges between the two groups.FROnTBACKSTAnDAlso fairly persuasive, Stand (7.85 out of 10) uses a young African American woman with her toddler to ask,\t“Who\tam\tI\tto\tjudge?”\tthe\tgay\tpeople\tshe\tknows. She\tconcludes,\t“Like\tthe\tman\tsaid,\t‘A\tthreat\tto\tjustice\t anywhere\tis\ta\tthreat\tto\tjustice\teverywhere.’”\tFROnTBACKDIRECT-mAIL TEST PIECES FOR FICTITIOUS CAmPAIGnS21 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American CommunitiesASK / TELLAsk/Tell (7.69 out of 10) focuses explicitly on the right of gay soldiers to serve openly in the military, and shows an African American woman with a  quote\tthat\tincludes\tthe\tlines,\t“I\tserved\tmy\tcountry…\tNow\tthe\tArmy\tis\tkicking\tme\tout…”FROnTBACKFAmILyFamily (7.59 out of 10) combines the concepts of family love and acceptance with a reminder that “God\tloves\tus\tall.”\tFROnTBACKDIRECT-mAIL TEST PIECES FOR FICTITIOUS CAmPAIGnS22 LGBT Rights and Advocacy: Messaging to African American Communities JUDGEJudge (7.49 out of 10) unambiguously ties Christianity to tolerance.

There is no evidence that one has captured attitudes towards transgendered people if the word is misunderstood, and there is no assurance that attitudes  would not change if respondents did have a fuller  understanding.\tWhile\tthis\tis\tcertainly\ta\tworthwhile\t area for further study, it was beyond the scope of this project. In addition, the acronyms GLBT or LGBT were not used because acronyms used during telephone interviews often cause confusion if the individual being interviewed is not aware of the acronym’s meaning.  The researchers were concerned that these types  of misunderstandings would frustrate or alienate  the respondents, leading to lower participation and  response rates for the survey. The two qualitative  portions of the research — the focus groups and  in-depth\tinterviews\t—\talso\tused\tthe\tphrase\t“gays\t and\tlesbians”\tfor\tconsistency.\tThe\tonline\tLGBT\tsurvey\tused\tthe\tacronym\t“GLBT”\t along\twith\tthe\tphrase\t“gays,\tlesbians,\tand\ttransgender\tpeople.”\tUse\tof\tthe\t“GLBT”\tacronym\twas\tmore\t appropriate since it was spelled out and the meaning could be read by the respondents.In several findings, this report juxtaposes the attitudes of African American respondents with those of randomly selected LGBT respondents, 85 percent of whom were white. Certainly, African American, other people of color and LGBT communities overlap in significant numbers, but are not included in this research. As such, it is  not the authors’ intent to create or suggest a false  dichotomy between LGBT American and African  American communities. In-DEPTh InTERVIEWS •\t\tThirty-six\t(36)\tin-depth\tinterviews\twith\tAfrican\t Americans were conducted in a one-on-one,  one-hour\tformat\tin\tthree\tlocations:\tSouthfield,\tMI\t (Nov. 14-16, 2007), Birmingham, AL (Nov. 27-28, 2007),\tand\tGreenbelt,\tMD\t(Dec.\t3-4,\t2007).\t•\t\tRespondents\twere\trecruited\tto\tensure\ta\t50-50\tsplit\tbetween men and women, and to get a range of ages, occupations, and educational levels.

A complete list  of participants and their demographic information  is appended. •\t\tAll\tinterviews\twere\tconducted\tby\tDonita\tBuffalo,\t of Buffalo Qualitative Research, a nationally known expert in qualitative research among African American  audiences.
