Introduction and background Recommendations Library spaces Library staff Library systems Library services Library culture Appendix A: Terminology Appendix B: Environment at VCU, March 2018 Appendix C: National context Appendix D: Literature review/resources Appendix E: Environmental scan Appendix F: Draft public-facing document Appendix G: Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup charge Executive summary The Gender-Inclusive Workgroup explored how VCU Libraries can better serve trans and gender-nonconforming users and staff. The group’s recommendations cover library spaces, staff, systems, services, and culture. Key recommendations include highlighting existing all-gender restrooms; building more gender-inclusive restrooms; expanding availability of menstrual products and disposal bins; continuing support for name-of-use changes in library systems; minimizing display of legal name in library systems; offering ongoing staff training in gender-inclusive language and customer service; and encouraging staff to share pronouns. The workgroup also recommends pursuing a culture of shared learning and inclusive thinking, with a reminder that gender identity is one facet of multiple intersecting identities for people in the VCU community.  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018          ​ 1 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Introduction and background The Gender-inclusive Library Workgroup convened in spring semester 2018 to develop recommendations for ways that VCU Libraries could be more inclusive for trans and gender-nonconforming/nonbinary library users and staff.  The group engaged in a ​literature review​ and an ​environmental scan​ to understand how libraries and campus spaces at other institutions serve trans and gender-nonconforming users, and developed a ​glossary of terminology​. We looked at university-level support for trans and gender non-conforming communities to get a sense of the ​environment at VCU​. We gathered information on issues affecting the trans community across the U.S. for ​national context​. We also asked VCU Libraries employees via an anonymous survey what information they needed to better understand these issues.   Most importantly, the workgroup reached out to VCU Libraries student employees who identify as trans or gender-nonconforming to get their ideas, and better understand their experiences in the library. By talking with student employees we were able to gain perspective on both the student and the employee point of view, and the students were paid for their hours worked on this committee. The workgroup extends its deep gratitude to those four students and the managers who encouraged their employees to collaborate with us. Recommendations Library spaces Accomplishments Since late fall 2010, Cabell Library has had two single stall, all-gender restrooms. One additional large single stall, all-gender restroom was intentionally built in as part of the new library construction and was opened to our users in March 2016. These restrooms are included on the ​Inclusive Restroom Map​ for VCU. Tompkins-McCaw Library has one staff-only single stall, all-gender restroom.  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 2 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Recommendations Across the literature review, environmental scan, conversations with students, and other research, the most talked-about way libraries serve trans and gender-nonconforming users is by offering restroom space that is private and accessible.  Highlight existing inclusive public restroom facilities in Cabell Library. ​Cabell Library already has three public, single-stall, all-gender restrooms. ​VCU’s position also states​ that the University “respects your right to use the facility corresponding with your gender identity, in accordance with university policy and federal and state law.” On May 10, 2017, President Rao emailed the VCU and VCU Health community in support of these restrooms. Thus the committee recommends making our single-stall, all-gender restrooms and VCU’s position even more visible: ● Add signs near the entrances to women’s/men’s restrooms to point to the single-stall, all-gender restrooms, with a reminder of university restroom policy. ● Add clearer signage elsewhere in the building, such as near elevators and stairs. ● Remove “family restroom” signage from third-floor single-stall, all-gender restroom to match university signage standards.  ● Publicize single-stall, all-gender restrooms in the Bottom Line, our in-restroom publication highlighting library services, on digital signage, on web-based floor maps, and elsewhere on a regular basis. ● Have maps available at all service desks that highlight locations of single-stall, all-gender restrooms. ● Include restroom information, including VCU’s policy on restroom use, in public services staff training and in orientation for new staff including student workers.  Improve existing staff restroom facilities in Cabell Library.  ● Renovate the men’s and women’s staff restrooms on the lower level to be used by anyone - staff or patrons. Either create two accessible single-stall, all-gender restrooms; or create two accessible multi-stall, all-gender restrooms with improved stall walls for additional privacy. These restrooms should be made more accessible by removing the single, metal door just inside the main restroom doors.  ● Install university standard signage for gender-inclusive restrooms.  ● If these restrooms are to be used for everyone, staff and patrons, the staff access card-swipe should be removed.  ● Additionally, if these rooms are converted to a single-stall, all-gender restroom, consider replacing the toilets with accessible toilets and installing changing tables.   VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 3 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11   Enhance restroom access in Tompkins-McCaw Library. ​With plans underway for a new library facility on the MCV campus, this may not be feasible for the space. ● Ensure that staff at Tompkins-McCaw Library are aware that the staff-only, single-stall restroom exists. ● Add signs near the entrances to women’s/men’s restrooms to point to the all-gender restrooms nearby on the MCV campus, with a reminder of university restroom policy. ● Make the single-stall restroom in the Pastore Exhibit Hall at Tompkins-McCaw available to library patrons with appropriate, university standard signage. ● Build in plans for a single-stall, all-gender restroom for new library spaces. ● Train staff on locations of nearby single-stall, all-gender restrooms on the MCV campus.  Increase access to sanitary products.​ We cannot assume that the only people who use sanitary products are people who use the women’s room.  ● Add bins in all restrooms for sanitary waste. ● Add vending options for pads and tampons that are either in all restrooms or available in a semi-private space not inside a restroom; add a note in all restrooms that indicates where to buy pads and tampons. These items could be part of a larger collection of personal medical supplies in the current office supply vending machine at Cabell Library, such as pain relievers, band aids, and condoms; by having a more general array of items, people approaching the machine to make purchases will not “out” themselves. ● For Tompkins-McCaw Library, add a vending option in all restrooms or in a semi-private space outside of the restrooms.  Consider building multi-stall all-gender restrooms.​ Other universities, including several libraries, have constructed multi-stall, all-gender restrooms. These restroom facilities offer enhanced privacy to all users with minimum gaps and/or floor to ceiling partitions. Because of the popularity of the single-stall restrooms in Cabell, more restroom options on more floors would help reduce wait times and increase visibility of these spaces for users. ● Convert smaller restrooms in “original Cabell” to multi-stall, all-gender restrooms. These would complement the newer men’s and women’s rooms in the Cabell Library expansion. ● Convert one or more restrooms in Tompkins-McCaw Library to multi- or single-stall all-gender restrooms.   VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 4 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Increase awareness of privacy in group and single-study spaces. ​Many students are aware of the different volume levels in different parts of library buildings, but not all are aware that there are private spaces that can be reserved, or that some spaces perceived as completely private may not be so. ● Publicize on a regular basis the fourth floor, reservable, single-person study retreats. These individual spaces are popular for our students trying to find a private space. ● Add sound baffling in study rooms to prevent private conversations from being as readily audible to those around.  ● Add signage in all study rooms alerting users to the lack of audio privacy in these spaces.   Library staff Accomplishments Many VCU librarians and staff have participated in VCU’s Safe Zone training. As a member of the LGBTQ Safety Awareness Committee for VCU Police, Donna Coghill, Community Engagement Librarian and Coordinator of Campus Partnerships, co-authored the Trans Sensitivity in Policing Context workshop which focuses on strategies for serving trans and gender-nonconforming people. This workshop has been taught to every VCU Police Academy since September 2015, as well as to other VCU Police officers and several members of regional police departments. John Glover, Humanities Research Librarian, and Donna created and maintain a ​Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Questioning (LGBTQ)​ research guide, which focuses on scholarly resources for study in this area. Additionally, Donna Coghill taught a Gender Inclusive Language workshop to the Teaching, Learning and Information (TLI) staff and librarians, who interact most with our patrons.   As of 2018, VCU Libraries job announcements no longer include gendered pronouns. Some staff have also begun to include their personal gender pronouns in their email signatures and when introducing themselves. Recommendations In addition to library spaces, our literature review, environmental scan, conversations with students, and other research often centered on library staff training and hiring.    VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 5 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Offer ongoing staff training. ​Full-time, part-time and student employees should be offered a variety of training opportunities. Currently, there are several generic training options on campus, such as Safe Zone and Building Inclusive Excellence workshops, neither of which focus solely on trans or gender non-conforming individuals. From library staff feedback, staff seem aware of deficiencies in their own knowledge, and express strong desire for educational opportunities, such as panel discussions with trans students and staff, definitive policies (particularly with customer service), and meeting with individuals and organizations from outside university libraries.  Training considerations for VCU Libraries: ● Schedule trainings on multiple dates at varying times on both campuses. ● Invite library-centric experienced trainers to lead training; having “generic” training does not always benefit the specific needs of library staff. ● Training topics could include: ○ Inclusive pronouns and “Trans 101” topics. This session could also include information about the university’s name change offerings.  ○ Gender-inclusive interactions at the service desk and in the classroom. This could include library-specific information, including gender-inclusive ways to verify a library user’s name at a service desk. ○ Supervising and interacting with diverse student groups and supervising LGBTQIA people.  ○ Gender-inclusive language/writing training to include web writing and social media as well as clarifying in our staff web style guide. ● Use Talent@VCU to manage trainings and reward employees for participation.  Examine staff recruitment and retention practices. ​Hiring and retention should be reflective of best, gender-inclusive practices for all full-time, part-time, and student employees.  ● Recruitment: ○ Job postings should remove any references to gender or gendered language.  ○ Following staff-wide training, in small-group interview settings, library staff should introduce themselves using their pronouns so that visiting candidates feel comfortable doing the same. ● In onboarding for all staff, including students: ○ Confirm the person’s name of use before ordering name tags or business cards.  ○ Offer to include pronouns on name tags and business cards. ○ Encourage staff to include pronouns in email signatures.  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 6 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  ○ Include locations of single-stall, all-gender restrooms in orientation to library buildings. ● For ongoing staff support, provide support mechanisms through HR for employee name of use changes and/or gender transitions.  Hire a specialist with a focus on equity and inclusion.​ The diversity of the campus community is an essential component of VCU’s culture, and the emphasis on inclusion in our campus-wide strategic plan would support hiring a full-time specialist in this area. ● Create a full-time position for an inclusion officer similar to the ​University of Michigan’s Diversity and Inclusion Specialist​. Such a position would recommend and/or oversee processes, services, and training for accessibility and inclusion issues writ large - not just for gender inclusion - at VCU Libraries. This position could be located full- or part-time on the MCV campus to guide support of trans and non-binary health research, or serve in this capacity until there is a position that focuses on this area of healthcare and research.  ● Hire a student liaison to the larger VCU student population to support the work of the full-time inclusion officer. This student position would keep the conversation open between VCU Libraries and our student community, and would also liaise with the VCU Libraries Diversity Committee.  Library systems  Accomplishments VCU Libraries systems support legal name changes through VCU’s system of record, Banner. Banner does not support non-legal name changes at this time, but some VCU Libraries systems allow users flexibility in changing their names of use: ● ILLiad, our interlibrary loan and document delivery service, does not rely on University systems to populate its name fields, so users are free to use the first and last names of their choice. When a user’s eID changes, they can create a new ILLiad account with the updated eID. Resource Sharing and Delivery can merge accounts on request. ● This spring, library IT staff implemented the university’s ​name of use change option for Alma/VCU Libraries Search. Students who have not yet legally changed their names but who have a gender-related name change will see the correct names indicated in their online “My Library” account and VCU Libraries staff see the correct name when they open the patron’s library account. ● Many other library systems display patrons’ eID rather than name as an identifier.  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 7 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Recommendations As a constant and direct point of contact for all library users at VCU, library systems should reflect the institution’s commitment to gender-inclusivity. Support for name of use changes and removing automatic displays of legal first names can be implemented in-house despite lack of Banner support.  Continue to provide support for name of use changes in Primo/Alma. ​Banner does not yet support non-legal first name changes, but the university allows students to request that a ​different first name​ be used in some systems, including e-mail. VCU Libraries systems staff receive updates to this list and are able to update the names that appear in Alma and users’ My Library Account. ● Continue importing names of use from the university into Alma and Primo. ● Publicize changes so affected students are aware of where their names change. ● Publicize changes via VCU Libraries channels including a ​public web page​ and Library News. Ask Technology Services to include a link from its ​Guide for Gender and Name of Use Notification​. ● Publicize changes to student organizations and ​Lavender Housing​ residents. ● Develop a workflow for name of use changes for faculty/staff/community in addition to the student workflow.  Remove legal first name from display on library systems where not needed.​ Often the patron’s name isn’t necessary or the displayed information can be replaced with an eID, or no information at all. ● On interactive public and staff web applications, if first name is a required field on a form, allow users to submit a name of their choosing. ● Revise donation forms, automated emails, and form letters to remove gendered honorifics, or, if a title is required, add gender-nonspecific “Mx.” option. ● On staff/public computer images, remove the logging-in user’s first name from logon or sleep/wake screens. On Mac, remove user’s name in upper right corner.  Encourage employees to indicate pronouns and/or participation in Safe Zone on their web profile pages. ​North Carolina State University recently ​added pronouns and Safe Zone training indicators​ to staff profile pages.  Publicize the ORCID service for researchers.​ VCU Libraries, in partnership with the VCU Office of Research and Innovation, has been an ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) member since 2017. ORCID provides a disambiguated non-gendered  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 8 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  identification for researchers that is helpful for pulling scholarship together that has been published under different names - aka “a persistent identity for humans.”  Library services Accomplishments VCU Libraries has co-sponsored events held in Cabell Library spaces, most recently a policy forum on Trans and Nonbinary issues in March 2018. Recommendations Services provided by VCU Libraries are already well-positioned to act as a hub of on-campus trans-inclusive resources and programming. This group recommends expanding upon current partnerships and communicating work being done by VCU Libraries.  Continue to partner with campus organizations to sponsor trans-friendly programming and services.​ ​The Well​, ​OMSA​, ​VCU Health​, ​New Student Orientation​, and ​Lavender Housing​ are all potential partners. ● In-person event programming can include events like the Trans Policy Forum in March 2018. ● Co-author a research guide for trans/nonbinary student resources on-campus and online.  Publicize trans-inclusive efforts. ​By talking about this work, the library will both show that it is a safe place for students and indicate to the University that we are committed to inclusion. It also allows students to engage with us and send further feedback and ideas. ● Include information on the website, either through the accessibility page or separately, about trans-inclusive work being done at VCU Libraries. ● Publish a version of this report online. ● Discuss inclusive initiatives with student groups for feedback.   VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 9 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Library culture Accomplishments VCU Libraries has a history of leadership in diversity and equity efforts among campus units, having one of the first written diversity plans at the university. Many staff and faculty have already added pronouns to their email signatures and state pronouns in introductions.  Recommendations in library culture Thinking more broadly, this group encourages VCU Libraries to continue to engage with gender inclusion topics past the lifespan of the group. ● Encourage all employees to add pronouns to their email signatures, name tags and business cards. ● In meeting facilitation and introductions, normalize the use of pronouns along with introductions. Many of our students do this already. ● Ask the VCU Libraries Diversity Committee to continue exploring how we can be a more gender-inclusive library. The conversation around LGBTQIA issues is constantly changing and evolving. ● Engage with library staff to provide ongoing training around equity and inclusion topics such as combating implicit bias, allyship, ways to promote racial equity and justice, and other topics that are relevant to library users’ lived experiences. Gender is but one part of people’s intersecting identities.  ● Encourage a culture of shared learning and growth, including safe environments for mistakes, and learning from and with each other.     VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 10 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Appendix A: Terminology Adapted from the ​CSUSM Trans and Gender-Nonconforming Task Force Report (2017)​, ​TransStudent.org​, and ​U.S. Department of Education's \"Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students\"​. ​Please note: terminology changes over time.  Cisgender / Cis: ​An adjective that means “identifies as their sex assigned at birth” derived from the Latin word meaning “on the same side.” A cisgender/cis person is not transgender. In discussions regarding trans issues, women who are trans are differentiated from those who are not by saying trans women and cis women. Note that cisgender does not have an “-ed” at the end and shouldn’t be used as a noun.  Cissexism: ​The social system that privileges and normalizes cisgender bodies and identities, and by extension, brands trans people as abnormal, deviant, and unnatural. Cissexism - whether intentional or unintentional - can include assumptions about people’s bodies and how they relate to them, and what sort of transgender bodies are deemed “acceptable” in society.  Deadnaming:​ The act of calling a transgender or nonbinary person by the name they were given at birth, rather than their name of use.  Gender expression:​ How a person communicates their gender identity to the world, usually through clothing, haircut, overall appearance and behavior.  Gender identity:​ A person’s own concept of self as female, male, both, or neither. Gender identity may or may not match the sex a person was assigned at birth.  Gender nonconforming: ​An adjective describing people whose gender expression differs from stereotypic expectations. Gender nonconforming people may identify as male, female, some combination of both, or neither.   LGBTQIA: ​a commonly-used acronym (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual) that encompasses a variety of sexual and gender minority identities. Frequent variations include LGBT, LBGTQ, GLBT, etc.  Nonbinary: ​Preferred umbrella term for all genders other than female/male or woman/man; used as an adjective (e.g. “Jesse is a nonbinary person”). Not all  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 11 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  nonbinary people identify as trans and not all trans people identify as nonbinary. Nonbinary people sometimes use “they/them” pronouns, but not always. Please ask before identifying someone. Use the term and pronouns preferred by the individual.  Personal gender pronouns: ​The way people prefer to be referred to in third person. If you’re not sure what a person’s pronouns are, it’s typically okay to ask. The term “preferred pronouns” is outdated, as for many trans and nonbinary people the idea of this being a “preference” invalidates the importance of using the correct pronoun.  Sexual orientation: ​A person’s emotional and sexual attraction to another person based on the gender of the other person. Sexual orientation and gender identity are different.   Transgender / Trans: ​An adjective describing people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth (e.g. “Janelle is a trans woman”). “Trans” can also be used as an umbrella term to include all transgender and gender non-conforming identities, including those who identify as transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, or elsewhere on the gender spectrum. The term transgender gives no indication of sexual orientation, hormonal makeup, physical anatomy, or how one is perceived in daily life. Transition paths and identities differ from person to person. Please ask before identifying someone. Use the term and pronouns preferred by the individual. Note that transgender does not have an “-ed” at the end and shouldn’t be used as a noun.  Trans woman / Trans man: “​Trans woman” generally describes someone assigned male at birth who identifies as a woman. Trans women are women.  “Trans man” generally describes someone assigned female at birth who identifies as a man. Trans men are men.  Sometimes trans women identify as male-to-female, MTF, M2F, or trans feminine. Sometimes trans men identify as female-to-male, FTM, F2M, or trans masculine. Please ask before identifying someone. Use the term and pronouns preferred by the individual.  Transphobia: ​Attitudes such as fear, discomfort, distrust, or disdain directed at trans people, which serve to marginalize and incite systematic violence against the community. This word is used similarly to homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny, etc.    VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 12 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Appendix B: Environment at VCU, March 2018 In 2016, the ​Division for Inclusive Excellence​ formed an LGBTQ Task Force. This group created a comprehensive report that reviewed current campus issues, LGBTQ history at VCU and in Central Virginia, and made recommendations for future facilities, services, and programs . As of this writing, most of the recommendations have not yet been 1implemented.   One action item from the report that is being considered is a freestanding LGBTQ Collective (aka Center). There is no space for faculty and staff, and very few spaces for students. This space would offer “LGBTQ communities, non-heteronormative, gender-inclusive, ADA accessible space where one can be “out” to the extent and in the ways that one feels safest…”  This Center will include a full-time staff devoted to 2research and advocacy.   Currently, VCU has no full-time faculty or staff member devoted to LGBTQIA issues. There is a staff member in ​OMSA​, the Office of Multicultural Student Affairs, who has part of their job devoted to student issues in regards to the LGBTQIA population.   In the Fall of 2017, ​University Counseling Services​ completely revamped its ​Safe Zone training. The new iteration offers a more comprehensive and inclusive look at LGBTQIA issues on campus. Donna Coghill has been a Safe Zone trainer since 2010.  VCU offers a 1 or 2-day workshop on ​Building Inclusive Communities​ (BIC). This workshop is aligned with VCU’s diversity and inclusion strategic plan, and focuses on all diverse groups, not specifically trans or gender-nonconforming.   The VCU Police have led the way on training with Trans Sensitivity in a Policing Context. VCU School of Medicine requires education on working with transgender patients as part of its accreditation requirements.   Equality VCU​, a faculty and staff LGBTQIA collaborative, advisory, and advocacy body, has been active since 1998. Under various names, this group has spearheaded many LGBTQIA initiatives on campus  including the Burnside Watstein LGBTQIA Awards 3(2006-present), campus advocacy with VCU administration, participation in hiring the 1 ​VCU LGBTQ Task Force Report​, 2016 2 VCU LGBTQ Initiative Implementation Workgroup, Implementation Report, December 2017 3 VCU LGBTQ Task Force Report, 2016, page 34-37  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 13 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Vice President for Inclusive Excellence and other key staff, and the first proposals for an LGBTQIA Center and staff.   In recent years, VCU has been more and more supportive of LGBTQIA students. In 2012, Equality VCU began the new ​Lavender Graduation​ tradition at VCU. In 2017, VCU implemented a new Living Learning Community dormitory option, ​Lavender Housing​. There are many events, programs, services, and student organizations on campus geared to the LGBTQIA students, most of which are supported through OMSA. Finally, the ​university ​offers students a non-legal name-of-use option​, though there is no similar non-legal mechanism for staff and faculty. As of 2018, VCU rates 4.5 out of 5 stars in the ​Campus Pride Index​.     VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 14 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Appendix C: National context Transgender rights continue to be a conversation on the national and local levels, including recent attempts to both expand and roll back legal protections for rights around education, employment, healthcare, and military service, to name a few. The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey Report from the National Center for Transgender Equality​ (NCTE) notes that “The findings reveal disturbing patterns of mistreatment and discrimination and startling disparities between transgender people in the survey and the U.S. population … Survey respondents also experienced harassment and violence at alarmingly high rates.“  The ​CSUSM task force report​ also notes that the Trans Survey highlights how race, ethnicity, and class have a compounding negative impact on trans people. That group noted that “the intersectional diversity of the CSUSM learning community makes this finding particularly noteworthy” and this is also true for VCU.  The 2015 survey outlines many issues facing the trans population. Below are some report statistics:  ● Housing: ○ Nearly one-quarter of respondents experienced some form of housing discrimination in the past year.  ○ Nearly one-third of respondents experienced homelessness at some point in their lives. ● Public Accomodations: ○ Nearly one-third experienced at least one type of mistreatment in the past year in a place of public accommodation. ○ Nearly one in ten respondents reported that someone denied them access to a restroom in the past year. ○ More than half of the respondents avoided using a public restroom.  ● Employment: ○ The unemployment rate among respondents (15%) was three times higher than the unemployment rate in the U.S. population (5%). ○ 30% of respondents who had a job in the past year reported being fired, denied a promotion, or experience. ● Family/Social Support: ○ 60% who were out to immediate family reported support. ○ 1 in 10 reported direct violence from a family member.  VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 15 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  ○ 19% left their spiritual community due to rejection. ● School: ○ 54% experienced bullying/harassment in school. ○ 24% were physically attacked. ○ 13% were sexually assaulted.  ● Identity Documentation: ○ 68% reported that none of their IDs had their name and gender of use. ○ 49% have no ID with their name of use. ○ 67% have no ID with their gender. ○ Only 30% completed a legal name change, with 34% reporting that the documentation cost over $250, and 11% reported costs exceeding $500. ○ 35% reported cost as the barrier to updating legal documentation.

We received responses from eighteen colleagues in academic and public libraries and the feedback helped guide our recommendations. To summarize this research:  ● Non-legal name of use change in systems:  ○ Libraries relied both on internal and campus options for users’ non-legal name changes, though not everyone had a name-of-use change process.  ● Public services:  ○ Some libraries offered pronoun badges/name tag options for staff. ○ Some libraries accepted any photo ID instead of a legal, state ID. ● Facilities/spaces: ○ Restrooms: many had no gender-neutral restroom,and some reported it was a campus-wide issue. Others did report to have at least one gender-neutral restroom or plans to install/renovate one. ○ Some libraries reported they had signage to make finding gender-neutral restrooms easier. These signs may also refer to restrooms outside of the library. ○ Several libraries had their own internal policy in regards to patrons using the restroom of their gender identity. Some also had signage inside and/or outside the restroom. ● Education/training: ○ Libraries reported training internally as well as external or campus options including a campus program such as Safe Zone.  ○ Training options included  ■ Unconscious bias and microaggressions ■ Trans/gender-inclusive pronouns and inclusivity ○ Libraries used a mix of internal and external trainers, and some respondents suggested seeking out trainers with a library background.

This page would be linked from the related Technology Services and other related VCU web pages. Suggested text for the VCU Libraries site:  Library services for trans and gender-nonconforming students Students may now ​notify VCU of a name of use change​, which will update the name on their library patron account and the name on ​My Account​. Students, faculty, and staff can update their name of use any time in ​ILLiad​, the interlibrary loan and document delivery service system.   Cabell Library offers  ● three ​single-stall, all-gender restrooms​, available to all guests of the library; ● individual study retreats​ which can be reserved for use by students, faculty, and staff; ● events addressing issues related to trans and nonbinary individuals; and ● scholarly resources for study in ​Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Questioning (LGBTQ)​ topics.  VCU Libraries is committed to providing a welcoming environment to all our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. If you have any questions about our gender-inclusive initiatives, ​Ask Us​.    VCU Libraries Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup Report – August 2018 20 https://doi.org/10.21974/338x-ps11  Appendix G: Gender-Inclusive Library Workgroup charge VCU Libraries - Management Council Purpose and background As part of continued efforts to provide a welcoming and inclusive space for all library users, VCU Libraries should seek ways to understand the needs of library users who identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. VCU’s Title IX Office and Technology Services have created a ​Guide for Gender and Name of Use Notification​. SCP staff have preliminarily examined our systems for opportunities to support non-legal name changes. There is also some opportunity here for promotion of ORCID as a non-gendered scholarly identification (also useful for name changes). Charge This workgroup will work to identify ways that systems, services and spaces can be more welcoming to transgender or gender-nonconforming/nonbinary library users, and supporting users in the case of non-legal name changes. Task ● Develop internal procedures for consistent responses to legal and name of use changes ● Develop a public facing document to complement the Guide for Gender and Name of Use Notification, and potentially have the VCU Libraries included on the Technology Services web page.  ● Consult with university resources as needed including Technology Services,Title IX Coordinator, Division of Inclusive Excellence, Equality VCU, OMSA, and student groups to identify existing efforts and areas for improvement ● Identify other areas for improvement and further action in services, spaces and systems Members Erin White, organizer M.

    "abstract": "The Gender-Inclusive Workgroup explored how VCU Libraries can better serve trans and gender-nonconforming users and staff. The group’s recommendations cover library spaces, staff, systems, services, and culture. Key recommendations include highlighting existing all-gender restrooms; building more gender-inclusive restrooms; expanding availability of menstrual products and disposal bins; continuing support for name-of-use changes in library systems; minimizing display of legal name in library systems; offering ongoing staff training in gender-inclusive language and customer service; and encouraging staff to share pronouns. The workgroup also recommends pursuing a culture of shared learning and inclusive thinking, with a reminder that gender identity is one facet of multiple intersecting identities for people in the VCU community",
