The socioeconomic gap sets up the middle and lower class for failure when it comes to a healthy diet.The food pyramid tells people to eat a healthy balance of fruits, vege-tables, grains, oils and protein.It is a great mixture of nutrients for the body, but prices for those items are hard to afford.Food prices have jumped aggressively in 2019, with products such as chick-en, eggs, canned vegetables, fish and oils all having price spikes as high as 41% in the past 10 years, according to USA Today.The last decade has made it more difficult to purchase these types of food items because of rising prices.

Th e Mosaic Cross Cultur-al Center, which advocates for underrepresented stu-dents and social justice issues funded the exhibition.Lecturer Jonathan Fung, who teaches art and art histo-ry, organized “Fast Fashion” with several of his students. Fast fashion is a term used to describe how mass market retailers expedi-tiously create inexpensive clothing to keep up with popular fashion trends. Th e installation piec-es included in “Fast Fash-ion” symbolized the ex-cessive waste generated by big business. Fung said the mound of donated clothes represented the overfl ow of landfi lls. Th ough the primary goal of this exhibition is to inform viewers about fast fashion, Fung also wants to provide clothes for attendees.  From 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., all clothes donated to “Fast Fashion” will be free for participants to take home.Fung said he wants everyone at the exhibit to know they can take the clothes home  regardless of their status at SJSU. “Th e clothes are open to any students . . . it can be faculty too,” Fung said. “It could be anyone that sees something they like in this huge pile of clothes that symbolizes the landfi ll or they see something on the rack - take the hanger, and the garments, and it’s yours.”“Fast Fashion” also includes representations of slow fashion and its pro-cesses through photographs made by Fung’s beginning photography class.Slow fashion is a term used to describe the sus-tainable process of creat-ing clothing of high quality and longevity. “Th ere is huge power and impact intersecting social justice and art, you can use art to bring change, to bring awareness, to educate, and this was case proven with my students that created beauti-ful triptychs of slow fashion as a visual response to fast fashion about sustainability, about good craft smanship, you know, about awareness,” Fung said.Marley Gerhart, a Notre Dame High School student who Fung men-tored, displayed her slow fashion photography along-side Fung’s beginning photography class. Her photographs tell the story of how slow fashion benefi ts the environment, the people who create the clothing and ultimately the consumer. “Th e thread is set against the plants to kind of show the environmental benefi ts of using ethically sourced materials that is used in slow fashion,” Gerhart said. She said participating in the exhibition has opened her eyes again about why fast fashion is harmful to the environment and the people that help manufacture it. “Th ere are a lot of factors that make slow fashion the better choice regardless of the time that it takes to man-ufacture,” Gerhart said.Her family taught her how to sew and design her own clothes at a young age which led her to be inter-ested in “ethically sourced clothing.” the increase of food pricing and stated, “In 2018, retail food-at-home prices rose 0.4%.”The price of eggs saw a 10.8% increase in 2018 making an important source of protein harder to obtain.Some might argue a 0.4% increase does not mean a whole lot, but just a slight change makes cheaper and unhealthier foods seem more appealing.According to 2018 research by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, “Evidence strongly suggests that excess food consumption is a primary cause of rising rates of obesity.”Highly processed energy-dense foods are cheaper, which leads to increased rates of obesity and likely to “socio-economic disparities in health,” the research stated.If it is faster and cheaper to grab an unhealthy meal, then it’s impossible to resist, especially if you are working with a tight budget.The issue with the trend is it is such a small incline in price differential that many people will still say eating healthy is a choice that a 0.4% increase should not affect, but prices add up quickly.According to a study published by the Harvard School of Public Health, eating a healthy diet will cost you $1.50 more each day.Once again, this number might appear minuscule, but $1.50 a day for a minimum wage worker is a lot in the big picture.The daily $1.50 per day slowly becomes $30.50 a month and eventually around $11,130 more spent a year just to eat healthier. Tempting fast food and fatty cheap goods are produced with too small a price tag to keep anyone struggling financially away from purchasing the goods.Until healthy foods can be distributed as easily as high carb foods, the fault should not be put on those who cannot afford better.Art exposes excessive waste in fashionBy Johanna MartinCONTRIBUTING WRITERCOSTSContinued from page 1Follow Chris on Twitter@ChrisCore24ILLUSTRATION BY CINDY CUELLARJOHANNA MARTIN | CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHERCivil engineering alumnus Yosef Gebre adjusts his art, which is displayed at the “Fast Fashion” exhibition Tuesday.Th e exhibition also in-cluded clothes and art made by civil engineering alumnus Yosef Gebre.Gebre’s art pieces consist of the “upcycling of clothes and hand painting clothes in full collections.”His upcycling process consists of hand sewing pieces of diff erent articles of clothing and then hand painting illustrations on the sewn pieces. “My vision was just to fi ll in a void that I saw in cloth-ing and I just wanted to make really powerful statement pieces,” Gebre said. “I like to think of each piece as more as a study.”Gebre is preparing for a runway show later this week where he will use some of his pieces displayed in “Fast Fashion.”“It’s my fi rst collection, so moving forward I defi -nitely want to work on how sustainable each piece is,” Gebre said.Fung also said curating this exhibition has changed him and his views on fashion. “I need to know where it’s being made. I need to know that there’s Fair Labor rights. I need to know that there’s safe working conditions, and I need to know that the materials are sustainable,” Fung said. “So I’ve learned a lot.

In 2016’s presidential election, about 75% voted, according to the Mercury News.Although voters will be allowed to vote at any cen-ter, Kurhi said this will not allow anyone to vote more than once because the county will track who has voted electronically.“Once you vote once; once we get your vote by mail or once you vote at a vote center, that’s that,” he said. “Th e rest are not go-ing to be counted.”Rather than worrying about voter fraud, Record said he is concerned that some vote centers could be overwhelmed with too many people.“If you head to some random polling place near your work and you see that the line is an hour-and-a-half long, that might dis-courage you from voting,” he said.Record said in-person voter fraud is so rare and unlikely that it is signifi cant.“Th e idea that there are people that are going to go around of their own vo-lition and go to multiple polling places and vote, risking federal prison, it seems absolutely nuts to me,” he said.Starting with the Pres-idential Primary Election on March 3, 2020, every registered voter will auto-matically be sent a Vote By Mail ballot 29 days before Election Day.Kaur said it is better to vote in person rather than by mail to avoid the chance of your vote being lost.According to the website of California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, 65.31% of ballots cast in 2018’s California Statewide Special Elec-tion were Vote By Mail or absentee ballots.Roughly 22 vote cen-ters open 11 days before Election Day and roughly 88 others will open four days before according to the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters. Kurhi said students should take advantage of more opportunities to vote and avoid lines by voting before Election Day.“You don’t have to wait in that line if you don’t want to,” he said. “Get things done a lit-tle early and everyone will be happier.”Dosanjh said she will take advantage of longer times to vote, “because I don’t know my schedule for the next week and I don’t know if I would have classes all day.”Record said most peo-ple will still want to vote on Election Day and stressed how much so-cial pressure aff ects whether citizens vote.“Th at’s when you’re likely to see somebody wearing an ‘I  Voted’ sticker,” he said.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 2019ELECTION NEWS 3You don’t have to wait in that line if you don’t want to.

She also remembers her uncle telling her mother that his citizenship was just a piece of paper and that he had always been an American, regardless of what a paper said.  However, other students are not able to find a permanent solution to put their families and their own minds at ease. “The majority of the adults in my family, if not all, are undocumented,” civil engineering sophomore Anthony Lopez, who is undocumented himself, said. “There is no visa, no green card or any possibility of them being legal that just made my family fear even more.”Lopez said his early high school years intensified his fear about his entire family being deported because he had not experienced being around so many conservatives at the same time. “I ended up going to a predominantly white school,” Lopez said. “I saw a lot of Trump supporters the day after the election. I went to mostly primary Mexican schools and it was shocking and scary to see many Trump supporters in one setting.” “It was kind of hard going from attending a school where people had similar experience and shared the same value, to a school that people did not understand the fear just existing and being called a criminal when you are just trying to live your life,” Lopez said. Even though they were not adults when Trump was elected, one student said she still feels the social change that was caused by the Trump administration. “Where I lived, some of them [my classmates] felt like their own community was against them,” political science sophomore Ashley Guerrero said. “They had no safe space.”Guerrero said that the possibility of Trump getting reelected does not seem realistic to her because of his actions in his current term. “We have already seen [Trump] being corrupt and trying to overpower other branches in the government,” Guerrero said. “Why would we let this happen again?”Donald Trump promised to strengthen the U.S. military and to bring the troops home during his presidential campaign.Connor Quinn, a health science graduate student, served as a combat medic in the Army for nine years, during the presidencies of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.Quinn said he felt more troops have been rotated back to the U.S. since Trump’s time in office, believing conflicts have died down on a large scale.Overall, Quinn felt that Presidents George W. Bush and Obama did a better job of handling issues domestically while it’s been Trump who has done a better job of resolving issues overseas.While Quinn admitted there is a chance that some of the things Trump enacted abroad could lead to conflict down the road, he praised Trump’s actions.“I don’t think a President of the United States ever crossed over into North Korea,” Quinn said, recognizing the fact that Trump was the first U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil.Quinn is referring to this past June when Trump briefly crossed over into the North Korean border and had an interaction with Kim Jung Un.While some praised Trump’s impact on the military during his time in office, others said they felt the military has been weakened following his election.“[He’s] encouraged more people to enlist and get away with a lot,” marketing senior Hannah Moreo said.Moreo, who served in the Air Force for four years, spoke of the cultural change following the election of Trump.“I know he’s changed the requirements with gender reassignment,” Moreo said.In 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense changed the policy regarding transgender service members in the U.S. military. New policies state that transgender military members may serve but they must do so under their biological sex.In terms of overseas conflict, Moreo does not think the military fared any better.“[He] changed foreign military relations, weakened our allies,” she said.For civil engineering senior Ricardo Torres, Trump’s presidency has been a mix of good and bad with no huge impact on the military either way.Having served in the Navy for 12 years, Torres said the transition from Obama to Trump was unlike any transition between presidents in the past.“That’s when things got difficult in the workspace, people didn’t like talking about politics as much,” Torres said. He compared openly talking about Trump to “walking on glass.”A noticeable benefit Torres said he saw that followed Trump’s election was the greater care for military veterans.One such example comes from the VA Mission Act, passed under the Trump administration, which aims to give veterans a greater array of treatments through the healthcare system. In Torres’ eyes there is no president capable of weakening the U.S. military.One thing that Torres felt has changed overseas since Trump was elected was the withdrawal of troops from Syria and said that it “hurt the hearts and minds.”President Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and behavior ever since he took office.“Overall I think that this presidency has been a disaster for the LGBTQ+ people,” biochemistry junior Murphy Guidice-Murphy said. “It’s more a battle of how much can we stabilize and keep it as together as we were until we actually have someone in office that produces some kind of progression.”In September, the U.S. Department of Education removed “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as terms to track in bullying data for the agency. It eliminated any tracking that would be used to report anti-LGBTQ+ bullying or discrimination, according to GLAAD. In October, the Trump administration announced support for allowing faith-based schools to use religion as a “right to discriminate” against LGBTQ+ teachers and staff and subsequently removed pro-LGBTQ+ curriculum.Behavioral science junior Lori Paris said that while she’s lucky to have faced no outright discrimination in San Jose, having a president like Trump who engages in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric shows the public it’s OK to think that way. “Its sucks because [with] him being so out there and definitely not diplomatic, [he] has encouraged people who have the same thoughts, who maybe were not vocalizing it as often, they’re out there voicing it more,” Paris said. Paris, who recently came out as LGBTQ+ and grew up in a Catholic family, said that politicians will produce policy that parallels their own standards and ideals, even if American ideals preach separation of church and state.Some within the LGBTQ+ community are still fearful of discrimination and their fear is often incited by President Trump. “Trump is actually actively trying to erase trans and intersex people which is just really awful,” computer science senior Vai Eldridge said. Eldridge, who identifies as transgender, said that erasing the identities of these individuals can have disastrous results including high rates of societal problems like domestic issues, self harm, suicide and depression. Guidice-Murphy said he is fearful of new changes to application forms by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.He said he is afraid that some of the changes that would require applicants to mark their sexual orientation will allow for discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. “So if you put, ‘Hi, I’m a gay male seeking treatment for HIV,’ or, ‘I’m someone that’s questioning my gender and I may want to actually be transitioning later on,’ those health and service programs that are typically provided, no matter what based on your income, becomes, ‘Oh, we can actually take this into account and reject your application based on those things,’ ” Guidice-Murphy said. Research from the Center for American Progress found that a significant gap in pay for gay and transgender Americans can also lead these individuals to rely more on public services.Its meta-analysis compiled in 2013 shows that these studies suggest that gay and bisexual men earned between 11% and 27% less than their heterosexual counterparts. “The average household income for same-sex couples raising children is $15,500, or 20% less than heterosexual couples,” the Center for American Progress said. Transgender individuals are impacted greatly by the LGBTQ+ wage gap.The study found that after transitioning, the income of  transgender Americans fell by one third of their previous income. “I’d like to see a lot more public funding, for actually having transitions, be considered a medical need so then something like Medicare would cover it,” Guidice-Murphy said. “Because right now it isn’t full coverage and it can largely vary case by case and sometimes they don’t cover it even when you have years of backup and recommendations.”He wants to call for easier and faster access that isn’t determined by sexual orientation.“We can go way beyond that right now,” Guidice-Murphy said.By Diana AvilaSTAFF WRITERBy Nathan DoyleSTAFF WRITERBy Erica LizarragoSTAFF WRITERILLUSTRATION BY NATHAN DOYLELGBTQ+ community faces discrimination by government  Follow Nathan on Instagram@nathan.doyle.docFollow Erica on Instagram@erica.lizarragoFollow Diana on Twitter@dianaavila284sjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 2019IMPEACHMENT 5By Chris CoreSTAFF WRITERImpeach all of the presidents who break the lawFollow Chris on Twitter@ChrisCore24Follow Kunal on Twitter@legoktmPHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EDUARDO TEIXEIRAImpeachment inquiry hearings have begun after months of them being discussed by Democrats for quite some time now.The party has done its best to find any crime committed by President Donald Trump bad enough to get him removed from office, but Democrats seem to forget that if he leaves or is forced out of office, Vice President Mike Pence would take over. Do they really want that?Pence served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001-13, and was unanimously elected chairman of the Republicans’ conference in 2009. He then decided to run on a grassroots platform for governor of Indiana.The majority of his platform was that he would cut taxes for the state and once elected, that’s exactly what he did.According to CNBC, the tax cuts Pence passed were the largest in Indiana history, containing “a $3.5 billion package that slashed state income taxes, lowered the corporate rate and eliminated the inheritance tax.”The Indy Star reported that the tax cuts were followed by the unemployment rate dropping by 3.5% in Indiana.Aside from major tax cuts, Pence has been a surprising advocate for a free press.According to The Washington Post, during his time in Congress, Pence co-signed legislation for federal shield laws that would allow reporters to keep sources anonymous against government requests.This is in vast contrast to the Trump administration which has been aggressive in attacking the free press. Tax cuts and free speech are things that Democrats might agree with, but Pence has plenty to his record that would leave “Never Trumpers” reeling if he took office.According to TIME Magazine, in 2006 Pence said that same-sex marriage would bring a “societal collapse” if ever made legal.This was not the first time Pence had faced controversy for homophobic comments, with a history of these type of statements starting back in 2000.According to The New York Times, an archived version of Pence’s original campaign website had a statement that attacked the Ryan White Care Act, which gives federal funding to HIV/AIDS patients.The statement from the website said, “Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.”Pence continued his scuffle with treating HIV/AIDS patients in 2017 when a piece of legislation was voted on in the House of Representatives to defund Planned Parenthood.Pence told a Vox reporter, “If Planned Parenthood wants to be involved in providing counseling services and HIV testing, they ought not be in the business of providing abortions. As long as they aspire to do that, I’ll be after them.”Aside from his disapproval of same-sex marriage and Planned Parenthood, Pence also received backlash in 2015 for signing Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, allowing businesses to refuse service on the basis of religion with impunity from local government.According to CNN, the act was later updated and signed by Pence, prohibiting the discrimination of sexual orientation.The step back to ensure that the LGBTQ community would not be affected is great in theory, but it didn’t change the fact it oppressed people using their religious beliefs.With this resume backing him, it is interesting that Democrats are so eager to have Trump removed and replaced with Pence.This was not the fi rst time Pence had faced controversy for homophobic comments, with a history of these type of statements starting back in 2000.ANALYSISImpeachment is a big deal. And if you try to impeach the president, you’ll quite literally break the news.It’s no surprise that all of the major TV networks decided to replace their normal programming with the House of Representatives’ hearings on an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.Most Americans haven’t seriously thought about impeachment since former President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 – and that’s a problem.Impeachment and removal from office is the final tool that Congress can use to hold the president accountable to the law. But because every president knows that a two-thirds Senate vote to remove a president from office is nearly impossible, any claim of “No one is above the law” is moot.The solution: use impeachment every time it’s supposed to be used, whenever the president has broken the law. Yes, that means former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush should have been impeached and removed from office, too.During September 2011, the Obama administration ordered and carried out a fatal drone strike against American-born Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who they claimed was involved in planning operations for al-Qaeda, according to The New York Times.The killing of al-Awlaki undoubtedly violated his constitutional right to due process, guaranteed by the Fifth and 14th Amendments.In 2014, when the Obama administration was forced to hand over an internal memo that justified depriving al-Awlaki of his due process rights, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union described the memo as “disturbing.”“[The memo is] ultimately an argument that the president can order targeted killings of Americans without ever having to account to anyone outside the executive branch,” ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer said to the Los Angeles Times.For those actions alone, President Obama should have been impeached and removed from office.Former President George W. Bush on the other hand actually did see articles of impeachment drafted against him, but with no real consequences. After 35 articles were written by Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the House voted to refer the issue to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which did nothing about it.Some of the articles concerned the Bush administration’s use of torture on prisoners. CNN reported that Bush apologized for the American soldiers who tortured Iraqi prisoners. However, Bush never revoked the Department of Justice memos that authorized the torture in the first place, effectively making him complicit in the entire ordeal.Another article alleged that under Bush’s watch, the National Security Agency engaged in overbroad and unlawful data collection. In April 2019, The New York Times reported that the NSA admitted it had violated U.S. law when it over collected data about Americans.It’s no surprise that it came to light after the end of Bush’s presidency in 2009, when impeachment was no longer a threat.And that’s exactly what impeachment should be – a threat to all presidents that if they choose not to follow the law, the American people, through Congress, will hold them accountable by removing them from office.One would hope that if the impeachment process had real weight behind it, our last two presidents wouldn’t have dared to break the law in the first place.In “Federalist No. 69” from 1788, founding father Alexander Hamilton explained that the impeachment process was one of the precautions taken that distinguished a president from a monarch.“The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred and inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to which he is amenable; no punishment to which he can be subjected without involving the crisis of a national revolution,” Hamilton wrote.And yet here we are, in the midst of what feels like a crisis of a national revolution. We absolutely need a real impeachment process, if only to ensure that our president is not a king.PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY CHELSEA NGUYEN FLEIGE AND EDUARDO TEIXEIRAOne would hope that if the impeachment process had real weight behind it, our last two presidents wouldn’t have dared to break the law in the fi rst place.Pence isn’t the president Democrats wantKunal MehtaEXECUTIVE EDITORSEA NGUYEN FLEIGE AND EDUARDO TEIXEIRAGeorge W. Bush Barack Obama Donald J. TrumpCOLUMNJohnny Khamis was the first Arab American to take office in the city of San Jose.“It kind of signals success and assimilation into a community when one of the members of the community has succeeded in running for political office,” he said.Johnny Khamis was a financial advisor for 19 years and he believed San Jose mismanaged its money before he ran for office. The councilmember saw libraries and parks in San Jose close and police layoffs reduce officers on the streets.“These people don’t know how to manage money,” Johnny Khamis said.The councilmember said he is proud of the money he has been able to save the city thus far.“A lot of it is minutiae . . . We were saving a million dollars a year on a lease for the police academy because we moved it into an empty building that was brand new,” he said.Johnny Khamis now has his political prowess set on a state senate seat, but he will have to do so without the aid of a political party.He is now an independent after leaving the Republican Party in 2018 because of President Donald Trump’s family separation policy, which allowed federal authorities to separate parents and children who attempted to enter the U.S.“When I first heard my dad considering leaving the Republican Party, I was against the idea because even though you are Republican, you do not have to like the actions of President Trump,” Constantin Khamis said. “However, I now believe he made the right decision because now that he is out . . . he is free to express his own opinions.”That policy was the last straw for Johnny Khamis, who said that he had been considering leaving the party ever since Trump was elected.“I’m not going to change my political points of view, but I will just not be tied down to whoever is in office and what their viewpoints are,” Johnny Khamis said. “I don’t care if it’s Democrat or Republican, I want to be known for my own viewpoints and not what a party tells me to say.”Having a no party preference has upsides and downsides when running for office, however.“There’s a big con. Parties are cash machines, so I don’t have access to a cash machine,” he said.Despite this, Johnny Khamis said he and his campaign have raised $360,000 so far. It’s less money than some of his opponents, but he enjoys the freedom of being an independent.“What is different, being without a party is I have the freedom to say what I want to say, without necessarily caring about who I’m going to offend at the party director level, which is something that none of my opponents could say,” he said.Enrique Navarro-Donnellan, SJSU political science alumnus, recently started working on Johnny Khamis’s campaign team again as an executive assistant after a previous stint between 2014-2016.Navarro-Donnellan said that working in the office can be a double-edged sword, but he’s enjoying the experience. “If the elected official is to lose their race, the staff loses their jobs. But at the same time the exposure we get . . . is immense,” Navarro-Donnellan said. “There’s a lot of reward to get from all the experiences.”Johnny Khamis leads in the polls in the District 15 Senate race according to an October San Jose Spotlight article.The 2020 California State Senate primary will be held March 3, 2020.The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict.”In the book, Chenoweth said in the last 10 years there have been more mass demonstrations calling for the removal of political leaders than in any decade since 1900.But in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration, there have been several key protest movements that have either worked or not worked. The 2019 Women’s March was one of those protests without a centralized policy goal.Armaline dove into the subject and said the organizers for the Women’s March didn’t effectively plan to build a broad-based movement where protesters could build political leverage.“They didn’t think very much or very hard about it as an organizing activity,” Armaline said. He added that the only way marches like this are effective is if the organizers use strategies to build and exercise power.“The more effective resistance strategies don’t just have symbols,” he said. “They build power and with every step, they move forward, [and] they build upon the previous. They seek to actually address change.”Jackson said that even though the Women’s March raised awareness, if organizers outlined policy changes they wanted to see, then the protest would have been more effective. “They’re just saying this is a really important issue that we need to be paying more attention to,” Jackson said.Biomedical engineering junior Arturo Chavez, said protesting and rallying at a local level is important for democracy and can be effective. Chavez is the chair of Student Advocates for Higher Education at SJSU, which promotes “higher education among immigrant students regardless of legal status.”“Protesting gives a voice to a group of people to collectively voice their grievances and raise awareness to issues they care about,” Chavez said.One of the examples in the organization’s advocacy work over the summer was when the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors voted against a policy preventing law enforcement from cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.The law was following the brutal stabbing of Bambi Larson, a woman who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in her home.Chavez said the advocates took part in the protests and marches happening over the summer relating to that push to shut down the policy change, which the board ended up not changing in the end.“[There’s] this goofball notion that rebellions following the murder of people by police officers somehow don’t go anywhere and don’t work, and that’s complete bullshit,” Chavez said.He added that specifically in cases such as the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 brought more people to rebel and demand for justice.“Empirically speaking, when you look at almost every single case of note since 2010 . . . it is only after there is public rebellion that there is any action by the state to do anything about those cases,” Armaline said.ELECTION ACTIVISMsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 20196SJSU alumnus seeks seat in state SenateBorn in Beirut, Lebanon, an 8-year-old Johnny Khamis and his family hid in bomb shelters in order to stay safe during the Lebanese Civil War.His father was taken away for questioning two times. After the second time, his family decided that it was best to leave.“We left everything, we took whatever cash was on hand,” Khamis said. “My dad didn’t even go to the bank, he just left all of his money at the bank and we fled across the border into Syria and we waited for political asylum paperwork.”Now 51, the San Jose State alumnus is a San Jose City Councilmember representing District 10 and a candidate for a state Senate seat.“I think my dad taking the senate seat for District 15 would [be] a huge achievement for our family and the immigrant community,” Constantin Khamis, Johnny’s son and computer science freshman, said. “The immense progress we have made from our humble beginnings is not only inspiring to me, but also is a defining principle [of] how empowering America is.”As he grew up, Johnny Khamis said he never thought of pursuing a career in politics. He graduated from SJSU in 1991 with a degree in business management.It wasn’t until the aftermath of 9/11 that Khamis decided to become more involved in politics.“I got a lot more involved in politics as an Arab American because I didn’t want the Arab American community to feel hatred,” Johnny Khamis said. “None of us condone what happened on 9/11 so I began kind of organizing the Arabic community locally here and then statewide.”When he was elected to the council in 2012, Follow Brendan on Twitter@BrendanCross93Protesters need clear missionCivil resistance and civil disobedience demonstrate the people’s opposition to a government’s policies, actions or the government itself.But the only way any actual change can come from both forms of protesting is if protesters and activists are specific in the policy changes and goals behind their social movements.Resistance and disobedience should be clearly distinct.Civil resistance is a broad term, encompassing nonviolent actions that demonstrate opposition to a policy, law or government. It is not as easy as holding symbolic protests.“The more specific your policy goal is, the more likely you are to see change on that issue,” Melinda Jackson, political science chair and professor, said.Historically speaking, both civil resistance and civil disobedience are embedded in influencing the United States government by opposing laws, political policies and actions that were racist or unpopular.An example of a symbolic protest was at the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games where San Jose State student-athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their black-gloved fists. It was a silent protest of the treatment of Black Americans and the poverty that affected communities predominantly made up of people of color. Their protest aimed to raise awareness without necessarily breaking the law.“They were certainly effective in that moment,” Jackson said.In the short term, she said, calling attention to those issues was a valuable political action and significantly altered the course of the civil rights movement.“I actually love to use their protest as an example of what we call symbolic speech when we talk about the First Amendment,” Jackson said. “Standing on the podium with their fists raised, they didn’t say a single word, but they communicated a really strong message right through symbolic speech.”But civil disobedience is by no means the same as resistance. Rather it is the act of intentionally breaking the law to protest. Civil disobedience is a refusal to cooperate with unjust laws, policies or government demands. You are not only breaking the law, you are doing so intentionally, as an act of protest. “I’m not doing [civil disobedience] to make all these other points or to achieve some end in the moment,” William Armaline, justices studies professor and SJSU Human Rights Program director, said.He added, “What I’m doing is I’m making a statement about a particular law by saying I am going to, in a very civil way, simply disobey this law because it is unjust.”Armaline referred to the civil rights movement when young African American protesters sat at segregated lunch counters and refused to move. They directly violated the Jim Crow laws of the South to demonstrate that unjust laws would not be accepted.Jackson similarly said that protests against the Vietnam War pushed the government to bring troops back to the United States. But when social justice movements don’t have that centralized focus, the problem arises, she said.  Civil resistance and disobedience have erupted around the world in recent years.“There has been in this decade a real rise in the use of mass protests in particular as a way to address grievances against governments around the world,” Harvard professor Erica Chenoweth, said in the book “Why Civil Resistance Works: By Christian TrujanoSTAFF WRITERFollow Christian on Twitter@ChristianTruja2MAURICIO LA PLANTE | SPARTAN DAILY ARCHIVESPublic health junior Cristian Hernandez Calderon (center) and photography senior Nanzi Muro (right) rally with dozens of demonstrators in support of preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy by San Jose City Hall, Nov.  5.BRENDAN CROSS | SPARTAN DAILYSan Jose City Councilmember Johnny Khamis speaks at an SJSU forum Monday.By Brendan Cross STAFF WRITERANALYSIS[There’s] this goofball notion that rebellions following the murder of people by police offi cers somehow don’t go anywhere and don’t work, and that’s complete bullshit.Arturo Chavezbiomedical engineering junior Student Advocates for Higher Education chairSince former President Richard Nixon 43 years before him, President Donald Trump is the first president in decades to not release his full tax returns.While serving as president, Trump continues to profit off of his business endeavors, which is a major conflict of interest.When Trump claims he has a massive amount of wealth, it seems only reasonable that the American public would want to see whether or not he has avoided tax laws over the years. As more wealthy businesspeople from both major parties are deciding to run for public office and in the upcoming 2020 presidential elections, it is only fair that Americans will continue to demand candidates release their tax returns.Nixon was heavily scrutinized after refusing to release his tax returns for three years. After the Watergate scandal unfolded, the American people learned Nixon had avoided paying $400,000 in taxes to the IRS. In 1973 Th e Providence Journal-Bulletin discovered a source that provided evidence that Nixon had paid taxes of only $792.81 in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971, despite exceeding an income of more than $400,000.After this was uncovered, Nixon famously said, “People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.” This was proved otherwise after Americans discovered his history of dodging taxes, among other crimes.Since then, every presidential nominee from 1980 to 2012 has released their tax returns, until Trump joined the presidential race in 2016. While this disclosure seems mandatory, the bipartisan tradition is purely voluntary. But for Americans, it means more than just numbers on a government form, it’s about transparency and truth. Releasing tax returns ensures the public that the president is paying their fair share just like everyone else. When the public looks towards what kind of candidates they want to elect for offi  ce, there is a truthfulness that comes out of seeing where the money travels. Tax returns contain important information like what candidates own and borrowed, charitable contributions, what taxes they’ve paid (if any) and whether or not they’ve taken advantage of tax loopholes or foreign bank accounts.  Seeing a full release of a candidate’s returns not only gives Americans clear information about the credibility of their money, but it can also indicate what kind of fiscal policies they will pursue in office. It can show whether there are confl icts of interest in their pursuit of public offi  ce or if there could be any entanglements with other foreign businesses that will consequently impact American politics. In 2018, an investigative report from Th e New York Times found that Trump had accumulated a wealth of over $413 million in today’s dollars from his father’s inheritance, but avoided paying taxes on it through loopholes and fi nancial agreements aided by his personal lawyers.As an American, this is clearly fraud to me.Trump has been credibly accused of engaging in criminal activity for decades.“It’s undisputed that he is still profi ting from his businesses,” Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor, said to Vox. “Th e tax returns may help provide information that sheds light on his motives.” Trump’s only public tax return is from 2005, which was nearly 15 years ago and 11 years before he decided to run for president in 2016. No candidate up for election finds this process enjoyable, but there is a level of truthfulness that it provides. As Americans continue to elect politicians who are nontraditional or come from various professional backgrounds, it’s in their best interest to see these tax returns.Our inquiry of full transparency is only continuing to grow and allowing the public to see such information can help Americans make an informed and logical vote. It is vital that nominees for public office are a part of the vetting process and presidential nominees should be held to the highest standard. We need to be confident that our president is not in it for financial gain or personal interests. While the law does not require presidential candidates to disclose tax return forms, many politicians have proposed bills that would require this in future races.A recently proposed bill called the Presidential Tax Transparency Act by U.S. Senator Ron Wyden would require candidates to release their most recent tax returns in the previous three years within 15 days of becoming a party’s formal nominee. Th e American people need to support proposed bills such as this one to gain an understanding of the full integrity of the candidates before an election occurs, not aft er.In a democracy like ours, transparency should be the regularly practiced gold standard.It’s much more than just seeing money going in and out, it’s about truth and trust: two things a president should always provide, no matter the cost.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 2019ELECTION OPINION 7ACROSS1.

Countless art pieces and videos displaying those dreaded two words ensued.Interest in the phrase has shot to shocking heights over the past few weeks, with it trending on Twitter and attracting the attention of countless publications condemning the phrase.Now, young and old people take the meme way too seriously, overstating the phrase’s significance and holding back the meme’s potential.Watching teenagers and young adults latch onto “OK Boomer” as a battle cry has been cringe inducing.Apparently “OK Boomer” actually has to mean something, which ruins a lot of potential for cutting short arguments not related to ageism at all with a ridiculous non sequitur.Tragically, “OK Boomer” is even creeping its way into politics.On Nov. 7, 25-year-old Chloe Swarbrick, a New Zealand lawmaker, replied with “OK Boomer” after a colleague interrupted her during a session of New Zealand’s Parliament.If Swarbrick meant to use this phrase as a lighthearted joke, then this comment was inappropriate in the context of an official meeting of a nation’s governing body.If she meant to use the phrase to represent the very serious political concerns of a generation, then that’s much worse.Older people are just as guilty of taking this meme way too seriously.On Nov. 13, The Washington Post published “The problem with ‘OK Boomer,’ ” after The New York Times had published a piece on Oct. 29 called “ ‘OK Boomer’ Marks the End of Friendly Generational Relations.”Major publications are not the only ones concerned about the meme either.In a now-deleted tweet, Bob Lonsberry, a conservative radio host from Rochester, New York, called boomer “the n-word of ageism.”This prompted a response from Dictonary.com’s Twitter, clarifying the definition of boomer as a term for people “born during a baby boom,” and calling the n-word “one of the most offensive words in the English language.”Equating the word “boomer”, whether used to refer to someone born during the baby boom after World War II or to disparage someone considered old, with something as offensive or serious as a racial slur is completely ridiculous.To get rid of some of the vitriol surrounding “OK Boomer,” people need to stop viewing the phrase as a battle cry or insult to their honor and start using it as just another meme.The potential of “OK Boomer” for comedic punch is strongest in insignificant situations where it would be least expected.So next time you’re fed up with a friend or family member about whether your favorite film is any good or where to find a parking spot, throw it in their face.But if you want to use it as a political weapon against your least favorite old fart, do us all a favor and stop ruining the meme.

Th e uproar stemmed primarily from right-wing critics, who voiced their dismay for his protest on grounds of disliking the use of his platform as a football player for political reasons. Th ose in support of Kaepernick’s opposition applauded his endeavor, stating it was not only courageous but foundational to the defense of American values for all citizens, especially proportionally overpoliced minority communities. When considering the historically volatile dynamic between law enforcement and racial minorities, Kaepernick’s objections toward the national anthem is predicated on the basis that the idea of American patriotism remains unfulfi lled for certain groups, particularly for African Americans. The relationship between the San Francisco 49ers and Kaepernick grew tenuous at best, and upon withdrawing from his contract early, Kaepernick became a free agent as the football conglomerate chose to remain as apolitical as possible under national scrutiny. Consequently, the National Football League’s decision to disassociate from Kaepernick for his political statement sends a chilling and harmful precedent for NFL players and their ability to express their beliefs on and off the football field. Kaepernick’s actions created a shockwave across sports entertainment and the political spectrum, forcing Americans on all sides to confront the realities of expressing divisive racial and political views in the workplace.Sincerely,Ashley Turnerjustice studies seniorDear editor,After conducting a survey with 40 SJSU students about financial literacy, only 17 % of respondents feel they have sufficient understanding and awareness of personal finance. I believe this issue stems from personal finance not being a required topic to be taught in high schools and colleges. This is an issue that heavily impacts the current lives of students and their life after graduation. One way this can be addressed is by arranging small-scale events that teach finance skills. The Spartan Speaker Series events are a great opportunity for students to hear from actors, comedians, activists, artists, historians and more. I would like to propose the idea of hosting more informative panels, workshops or seminars about financial literacy for college students. Budgeting, building credit, savings, retirement, job security, benefits, pensions and many other topics are among some that would be highly beneficial. Sincerely, Ashley Hekkertjournalism juniorSanta Clara County needs more health clinics in areaBad communication will lead to a lot of confusionDear editor, Santa Clara County residents that are without health insurance is 6.53% and those who are unsheltered (homeless) are 82% in the year of 2019. We have to question who do these people go to when they are in need of services that pertain to their health. If you haven’t questioned it, you should because this person could be you or a family member. Everyone should have the right to be treated and seen when ill, however that isn’t always the case. My solution to this issue is to have a pop-up clinic once a month in Santa Clara County specifi cally Downtown San Jose. Th e pop-up clinic would be a rented space where medical practitioners and holistic healers would be able to treat every single person who walks in the door. In order to make this happen we’d have volunteers from the community who are licensed in the medical fi eld that would dedicate their time to those in need. Th e purpose of this clinic is not only to treat those who have not been seen but to educate the public on how we can better serve others. I would like this clinic to raise much awareness on the media that it could become a permanent clinic in multiple towns of Santa Clara County and prevent less people from being ill.Sincerely,Raquel Valenzuelacommunication studies seniorDear editor,I am writing out of concern and irritation over the current situation in the Campus Village B laundry room. Students had expressed concern over the outdated, and oft en broken, laundry machines throughout campus housing and especially in CVB for some time before this point. While the housing administration is now fi nally addressing that issue, the way they have gone about it has caused even more inconvenience. Th e housing administration removed every CVB laundry machine on the same day, without giving students any meaningful time to prepare. A single email was sent on the same day as the removal, and though signs were placed outside the laundry room many students go infrequently enough to have missed it or just didn’t notice the small signs. Th is has forced us residents to use the much smaller laundry rooms in Campus Village C and Joe West we’ve been allowed access to, both of which are incredibly inadequate to serve their normal residents and the residents from CVB. Additionally, while Joe West recently had its laundry machines replaced, CVC’s machines are in just as bad a condition as the machines being replaced in CVB.A simple solution that would have saved residents a signifi cant amount of trouble, would just be to stagger the removal and replacement of the machines in CVB. Th ey could have easily removed one row or aisle of the laundry machines at a time, allowing students to continue using the machines as they were being replaced. Th is would also introduce students to the new system gradually instead of being thrown in when using the Joe West laundry rooms, or the new machines in CVB once they’re replaced. I would also argue that a few more emails in preparation for this switch would have been very helpful to residents, including myself, and saved us from the annoyance and inconvenience this situation has caused.Sincerely,Lily A. Kaplanradio, TV and fi lm sophomoreProvide more assistance to people who walk to school DACA students must be afforded extra protectionsDear editor,This letter is in response to the Nov. 6 article titled “DACA supporters rally in front of SJ City Hall.”I am glad to hear that San Jose State has joined an amicus brief to support Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program students on campus, but I feel their struggles are only briefly mentioned and supported from afar. The underrepresentation of the struggle of DACA students is detrimental to the university’s knowledge of the problem. In today’s political climate, DACA students are not awarded the same opportunities as other students, yet it is continuously shoved in their faces. Many of my DACA peers are unable to study abroad, for fear they may not be able to re-enter the country. Yet, almost every week, they receive emails about study abroad sessions they should attend. A friend of mine dreams of studying abroad in China, an opportunity San Jose State off ers, but she cannot take advantage of the opportunity. Th e program is brought up by her professors, her peers and on fl yers hanging around campus. San Jose State needs to do more than just warn DACA students not to leave the country and support them with more hands-on solutions, like fi nding alternatives to study abroad programs they can join for experiences that might not be as exciting as studying abroad, but still a safer opportunity for them to take. I also think the university needs to be more aware of the types of language they use when promoting study abroad programs. DACA students are part of this campus too, and deserve to be respected and off ered just as many opportunities. Sincerely,Hina Janjua communication studies seniorDear editor, There are many times when I feel unsafe walking to the 181 bus stop on First and Santa Clara streets after my night classes at SJSU. SJSU is known to be a commuter school and many students like myself take the 181 bus from San Jose to Fremont after dark. We carry laptops, phones and other possessions that can make us a target. Just a month ago, I was chased down by a man who grabbed me and claimed that my bag was his. I had to push him away and run as fast as I could, screaming for help. There are many other instances where I have been cat-called, or even persistently asked to get in someone’s car. To address this issue, I would like to propose a community within the SJSU Sammy App that supports a “buddy system.”That way, when students are walking to the bus station from school at night, they can call, message, or notify another student to help them walk to the designated bus stop. The student who decides to help can be traveling in the same direction or is just not busy at the time. Not only will this help security within SJSU’s boundaries, but also build a stronger community and possibly friendships.  Sincerely, Gia Phamjournalism juniorHave a story idea?Contact us atspartandaily@gmail.com.Dear editor,I wanted to write about winter sessions at SJSU. It shouldn’t allow students to take winter sessions as they are taking away from other students who may have done that class in fall, spring or summer. Allowing students to take the easy way out with a two-week class won’t allow students to fully understand what they need to learn.A possible solution for this is not doing winter sessions at all. Another solution is suggesting students to do summer classes so that they are able to take the class  if they can’t during the spring or fall semesters. Another solution can be if you want to allow students to take it, make it the week aft er fall semester so that they will have to take the class for a whole month at least.Sincerely,Marcus Guillencommunication studies juniorShort winter courses award the lazy students“Every offense is different, so, what we see on film, we have a gameplan to attack it and we’re gonna execute that gameplan to get the outcome that we want,” Lenard said.If the Spartans leave Las Vegas as winners, the last game of the season is a home tilt against Fresno State and will decide whether or not the team is bowl eligible.On Saturday, Nov. 30, CEFCU Stadium will host senior night against the Bulldogs in a fight for the Valley Trophy.The trophy represents high-tech capitol Silicon Valley facing off against the agriculturally-rich San Joaquin Valley, according to the SJSU Athletics website.The Fresno State game will be televised on ESPN2.SPORTSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 201910Spartans need pair of wins for bowl bidBy Brendan CrossSTAFF WRITERNow-senior quarterback Josh Love hands the ball off to now-junior running back Tyler Nevens. San Jose State beat the University of Nevada, Las Vegas 50-37 on Oct. 27, 2018 for their only win of the season. GABRIEL MUNGARAY | SPARTAN DAILY ARCHIVESThe San Jose State football team needs to win each of its last two games to be eligible for its first bowl game bid since winning the 2015 AutoNation Cure Bowl against Georgia State.The Spartans’ (4-6, 1-5 MWC) first test will be a road game against the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (2-8, 0-6 MWC).The Runnin’ Rebels are sitting dead last in the Mountain West Conference and have lost four consecutive games.Despite UNLV’s struggles, Spartan head coach Brent Brennan isn’t taking the team lightly.“This is gonna be another battle for us,” Brennan said during his weekly press conference. “It’s going to be a really tough game and we’re excited to do the work this week and go on the road and play.”After back-to-back closely-contested games against Boise State and the University of Hawaii, the Spartans were able to take advantage of a bye week in order to heal up and game plan for the remainder of the season.Win or loss, senior quarterback Josh Love has had consistent production, partially thanks to only being sacked 10 times all season.“I think it speaks a little bit to being here for our third year as a coaching staff and having some continuity,” Brennan said. “When you combine all those things, the hard work of the players and the effort they put in to the preparation, it’s been a really positive result.”The Spartans have dominated the Runnin’ Rebels in recent years, winning eight of the last nine contests. SJSU’s most recent victory against UNLV came last season. The Spartans hung  50 points on the Runnin’ Rebels for their only win of the season.UNLV’s defense has been spotty, allowing 33 points per game this season.Senior wide receiver Bailey Gaither said the opponent on the other side of the field doesn’t matter, he and the team still needs to execute.“For the most part, we look at every team [as] nameless, faceless opponents,” Gaither said. “We have an objective that we try and make happen.”Gaither was a redshirt freshman during his first season on the team, making him one of the only active players who experienced the last time SJSU played in a bowl game.“It would be cool to obviously go to another one, so this is just one step in the way on Saturday,” Gaither said. UNLV made a starting quarterback change during the season, sitting junior Armani Rogers in favor of freshman Kenyon Oblad. “I really like how he plays, I think [this] kid’s going to be a really good player,” Brennan said about Oblad. “It’s always a tough deal when [teams] have played multiple quarterbacks, but it’s just something that you have to try and prepare for.”Regardless of who is taking the snaps, junior safety Jay Lenard said the Runnin’ Rebels are a quality opponent based on his film study.Follow Brendan on Twitter@BrendanCross93For the most part, we look at every team [as] nameless, faceless opponents.

But inclusivity does not equal titillating flavor.The two slices I ordered were the Margherita, $5.25 a slice, and the Spring Cream, $5.75 a slice.I decided to dive into the Margherita slice first, which I want to say I had food review“Pizza Flora”Rating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Cuisine: Italian Location: 78 S. First St.,San Jose, Calif. Price: $‘Friends’ wins the sitcom battle todayCOLUMNNathan Doyle STAFF WRITEROn one side of New York City, six friends sit together in a coff ee shop and talk about the challenges and triumphs life throws their way.On another side of New York City, fi ve friends get together in an Irish bar, cracking jokes while one man comes yet another day closer to meeting his future wife.Th e simplistic comedy is why I prefer the show about six friends in the coff ee house, also known as “Friends.”It premiered in 1994 and followed the lives of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, Monica and Joey for 10 years, becoming one of the most quotable shows of all time.Th e other show, “How I Met Your Mother,” premiered a year aft er the end of “Friends” and followed the lives of best friends Marshall, Lily, Ted, Barney and Robin until its fi nal season in 2014.Both shows are about a group of friends in their late twenties to early thirties who face supposedly everyday problems, coming to terms with the messiness of life and becoming a family unit.Fans have long debated which show is better. Despite both shows providing comedy gold for millions of viewers, “Friends” is the better show.While “How I Met Your Mother” fans admit the show took inspiration from “Friends,” it’s obvious that “How I Met Your Mother” is a rip-off .Th e common argument for fans who prefer “How I Met Your Mother” is that it has stronger comedic value and general unpredictability, despite having an overarching narrative.“Friends” focused on the moment-to-moment lives of each character, showing that life is full of surprises and constant change.Th e undeniable message that both shows share is that life is a complicated and beautiful journey, full of heartache, love and over-the-top people.Th rough “How I Met Your Mother,” audiences learn that each moment in life weaved a tapestry to a much larger picture and everything will eventually come together, just not the way you expect it.But “Friends” stuck closer to living in the now, something I personally appreciate at a point in my life when I’m constantly worried about the future.Both shows had a star-studded cast at the time, with Jason Segel and Neil Patrick Harris on “How I Met Your Mother” and Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox on “Friends.”However, the cast members for both shows were used to convey diff erent comedic tones as a way of distinguishing the shows.Although “Friends” had very strong comedic tones, it stuck relatively close to reality and had a consistent tone throughout the series.“How I Met Your Mother,” on the other hand, was narrated from the future and used a romanticized and comedic refl ection on the past.Th is in turn gave the creators of “How I Met Your Mother” the opportunity to use diff erent tones throughout the series and still be able to stick the landing for the majority of the show.But it fell apart with an unnecessarily controversial series fi nale, leaving a bad taste in my mouth.From the core group of friends with the running gags and the New York City setting, “Friends” developed a clear aesthetic and feel that “How I Met Your Mother” copied for a more modern time.For anyone choosing between the two shows, “Friends” is essential to watch fi rst because it is the gold standard that other sitcoms have since followed.The pizza tasted as if Chef Boyardee himself was in the kitchen and decided to dump an entire can of spaghetti sauce on a thin slice of bread.Follow Nathan on Instagram@nathan.doyle.docPizza Flora, located on South First street, off ers up slices of Spring Cream (left) and Margherita (right) pizza.high hopes for, but then I would just be lying.The “local organic tomato” pizza looked like a blistered foot that had just run a marathon.The bubbly cheese cysts were not only unbearable to my eyes, but to my tongue as well.The pizza tasted as if Chef Boyardee himself was in the kitchen and decided to dump an entire can of spaghetti sauce on a thin slice of bread.The crust at the edge was the only saving grace the pizza had, not only because it was fluffy and delightful, but also because I knew I was finally done eating the slice.The Spring Cream slice was next in line for me to consume and this pizza had my attention.The pale mozzarella cheese base accentuated the criss-crossed pattern of pesto sauce topping, but sadly looking at the slice was the only satisfaction this pizza gave me.Where the Margherita slice tasted of pure pizza sauce, this wedge was like eating a jumble of wet toppings on bread.The pizza was hard to consume for the simple fact that it was a bland mouthful of mush.The restaurant’s savior amongst the pizza debacle is that it is a great cafe that has an array of  craft beers, wines, coffees and on-tap kombucha to choose from.That’s cool and all, but the restaurant is called Pizza Flora, not Cafe Flora.I felt betrayed that a location that bears “pizza” in its name could not execute a $5 slice of pizza properly.For the same price as two pizza slices I would have much rather settled for a Little Caesars pizza with some Crazy Bread and that is not a compliment to Little Caesars by any means.The service was quick and I appreciated the welcoming aura the cashier radiated, but with so many pizza options near campus for me to choose from, a friendly smile is not going to lure me back in for a second visit.If you are looking for a relaxed cafe downtown to sit and have a drink, then maybe Pizza Flora is the place for you, but if a satisfying slice of Italian goodness is what you’re craving, set your sights elsewhere.This pizza poisoned my paletteARTS & ENTERTAINMENTsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 201912Glassblowing Spartans handle the heatPHOTOS BY JESUS TELLITUDStudio arts junior Viridiana Millan is assisted by a classmate as she pinches her glass product to mold a neck.
