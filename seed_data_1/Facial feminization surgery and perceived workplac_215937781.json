    "abstract": "Facial feminization surgery (FFS) is a set of procedures performed with the goal\r\nof creating a facial appearance that is considered phenotypically female. These\r\nprocedures are usually sought by cisgender women but have become increasingly popular\r\namong male to female (MTF) transgender individuals. FFS has been shown to decrease\r\nappearance anxiety and increase quality of life. Sexual minorities, including transgender\r\nindividuals, are subject to a unique set of stressors termed minority stress, which involves\r\nthe interplay of perceived and outright discrimination. This type of stress has been shown\r\nto lead to adverse physical and mental health outcomes. The workplace is no exception to\r\nthis type of discrimination, and workplace discrimination has specifically been associated\r\nwith adverse physical health outcomes. However, there have been few studies to date\r\nevaluating workplace discrimination and transgender identity. This study aims to expand\r\non that knowledge, and determine the potential role for FFS as an intervention to reduce\r\nperceived bias",
