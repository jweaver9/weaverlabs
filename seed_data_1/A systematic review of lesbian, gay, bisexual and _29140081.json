Until now, most health research on gay and bisexual men has been around HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and for trans people has been on the transitioning process only. However, it has been apparent to the LGBT community that that there are a wide variety of other physical and mental health issues that are also important and that the proportion of gay and bisexual men who have HIV/AIDS is relatively small. Very little general LGBT health research has been published so far and there are very few health services that specifically address the general health concerns of the LGBT community.   This systematic review presents all available research conducted in the West Midlands on LGBT health since 2000. Local health research is compared to UK national, peer reviewed and published LGBT health research in order to determine whether the local results are unusual compared to national LGBT data, and to routinely collected data on the UK population, where appropriate, in order to determine whether and where the LGBT population differ from the general population. Only UK research has been included because there was no previous UK-specific systematic review so it was unclear how generalisable foreign research would be to the UK.   Methods A protocol was developed and underwent NHS peer review. Searches were conducted in a variety of standard databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO to May 2008. Internet searches were conducted in appropriate specialist websites and extensive contact was made with experts. Included were West Midlands surveys, systematic reviews with UK studies and peer reviewed and published UK quantitative and qualitative primary studies on LGBT people reporting any physical and mental health outcomes, health behaviours and experience of healthcare. Excluded were papers on HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, transitioning, non-peer reviewed research, narrative literature reviews without a search strategy, opinion pieces and policy documents. Inclusion LGBT health  Vdecisions were made in duplicate. Data extraction and quality assessment was conducted by one person and checked by a second, with differences resolved through discussion. Data synthesis was narrative and through the use of data tables. Results were organised by ICD-10 categories.  Results Nine West Midlands surveys, two systematic reviews, 11 quantitative and 14 qualitative primary research papers were included, with a wide range of study designs and outcomes measured. Studies were generally of poor quality but unpublished and published LGB results were broadly similar.   No results were found on the general health of trans people and very little on people who identify as bisexual. No LGB results were found on many common physical diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, digestive diseases or autoimmune diseases, but more on aspects of mental health, health behaviours and use of health services. There were higher rates of breast cancer, mental health problems (depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, eating disorders, self harm) and poor health behaviours (smoking, poor diet, illegal drug use). There were low access rates of cervical screening but no cervical cancer rates in lesbians and bisexual women. There were higher rates of risk factors for cardiovascular disease but almost nothing on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. There was a lower rate of successful hepatitis B vaccination in gay men compared to controls but no follow up research to offer an explanation. A high proportion of LGB people access mental health counselling but many do not find it beneficial. The research on LGB experience of healthcare suggested numerous barriers including homophobia and heterosexism, misunderstandings and lack of knowledge, lack of appropriate protocols, poor confidentiality and the absence of LGBT-friendly resources.   Conclusions There is no need for more small surveys on the same aspects of LGBT mental health, health behaviours and experiences of healthcare as these have already been investigated. Further research is needed but must use more sophisticated designs with comparison groups. This systematic review demonstrated that there are so LGBT health  VImany gaps in knowledge around LGBT health that a wide variety of studies are needed. For example, it is unclear whether the high breast cancer prevalence rates in lesbians and bisexual women are because of high incidence rates or other reasons. It has been presumed that lesbians and bisexual women are at lower risk of cervical cancer than the general population and cervical screening rates are only ~50%, yet there was no information on cervical cancer rates and the fact that a higher proportion of lesbians and bisexual women had heterosexual sex before the age of 16 (43% v 21%) suggests that some lesbians and bisexual women might be at higher rather than lower risk. Large general population cohort studies recording sexual orientation could be used to determine incidence rates of a variety of health problems. If routinely collected data included the ONS-developed sexual orientation question it could address numerous research questions. For example, if sexual orientation was collected on death certificates, it could be found whether the high rates of suicide ideation and suicide attempts in LGB people were matched by higher successful suicide rates. If sexual orientation and trans information was collected in hospital episode statistics, it would be possible to determine if LGBT people present with serious symptoms and signs of ill-health later than would otherwise be the case.   There should be: • Compliance of all NHS services with current legislation and The NHS Constitution • Routine confidential sexual orientation and gender identity monitoring across all health services and use of this monitoring to improve services  • Routine confidential sexual orientation and gender identity data collection in all research, in a similar way to ethnicity, gender and age data collection currently undertaken • Targeted research into specific areas highlighted in this systematic review • LGB and Trans focused education of all healthcare workers • LGBT-specific health service provision where required. Otherwise, explicitly LGBT-friendly mainstream service provision. LGBT health  VII  CONTENTS  1.

AIM OF THE REVIEW  This systematic review presents all available research conducted in the West Midlands on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) physical and mental health, health behaviours and experience of healthcare since 2000. Local health research is compared to UK national, peer reviewed and published LGBT health research and to routinely collected data on the UK population where appropriate in order to make recommendations for NHS practice and highlight future research priorities. 2. BACKGROUND  2.1 Description of population 2.1.1 Sexual orientation Sexual orientation is a complex construct. The Equality Act 20061 refers to an “individual’s sexual orientation towards – (a) persons of the same sex as him or her, (b) persons of the opposite sex, or (c) both”. Sexual orientation includes a variety of aspects including attraction, behaviour, fantasy, emotion and identity.2 and can be seen as fluid and sometimes changing over time.3   One of the main dichotomies in describing sexual orientation is the difference between identity and behaviour. For example, a woman can identify as a lesbian but may not have had sex for a number of years and in her youth may have had sex with a man (and may have married and had a child with him) before she had sex with a woman and lost interest in men. Therefore during her life she could variously be described as heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian and abstaining. For individuals, what really matters is how they identify, rather than behaviour in the recent or distant past.4,5  For the purposes of sexual health research, people are often classified by their behaviour within a certain length of time such as the previous year6 or previous five years.7 So the following descriptions are often used: • Men who have sex with women (MSW) LGBT health  2• Men who have sex with women and men (MSWM) • Men who have sex with men (MSM) • Women who have sex with women (WSW) • Women who have sex with men and women (WSMW) • Women who have sex with men (WSM) • Not in a sexual relationship  However, it is clear from surveys that behaviour and identity are often different in individuals so the following is an example of the type of statements that are often found in LGB surveys:   “Of the ten men who regarded themselves as heterosexual, two had experienced a sexual relationship with a man in the past year. Of those women who identified as heterosexual, 67% had engaged in a sexual relationship with a woman in the last 12 months. Additionally, a third of women who identified as lesbian had experienced a sexual relationship with a man in the past twelve months.” (Measure for Measure 28)  The use of MSM/WSW terms are incomplete ways to describe people in that they describe recent sexual behaviour only and say little about individual social behaviour, they obscure social dimensions of sexual orientation, and undermine self-labelling of people.4 People may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviour. For most people, sexual orientation is thought not to be a matter of choice.9   It is particularly noticeable that people tend to identify themselves as gay/lesbian or heterosexual rather than bisexual even though they are currently behaving bisexually. It is thought that this might be due to lack of acceptance of bisexuality (biphobia) in the lesbian/gay community as well as the heterosexual community.10  2.1.2 Gender identity Transgender or, more often now trans, are terms that people choose to describe themselves whereas ‘transsexual’ is thought of as a medically defined term ascribed to people by doctors and appearing in diagnostic guides. Language to describe trans people is a sensitive subject because of the past link between the transsexual term and presumed mental illness. It is now acknowledged that being trans is not a mental illness.11 Trans people are those who cross gender barriers. This can be permanent LGBT health  3 or temporary and may involve surgery and hormonal treatment or may not. There is a blurring of categories between people who dress in stereotypical clothes of another gender (previously called transvestites) to people who have gender reassignment and obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate.11 Transitioning is the process of gender reassignment and can involve surgery, hormonal treatment and counselling.   2.1.3 Epidemiology There is no accurate estimate of the prevalence of LGB people in the UK. This may be because it is easy for LGB people to indicate to interviewers that they are heterosexual or for them to prefer not to say. This can occur even when people otherwise identify as LGB, and could be caused by embarrassment, reluctance to talk about a private matter or for fear of discrimination. There are also differences between identity and behaviour as outlined above which affect measurement.   Sexual orientation is not collected routinely in the UK Census or in hospital or other health statistics. There has been consultation about including it in the 2011 census.12 This stated that “On the strength of user requirements this topic would have been placed in category 2. However, the ONS view remains that such questions are not suitable for the 2011 census.”1   Considerable work has been done by the Office for National Statistics about developing a suitable survey question for use in population surveys. Information on this is available on the UK Census website.13 There have been four trials already of different wording of the sexual orientation question and whether individuals could answer by self-completion or whether the question should be administered by an interviewer.14-16 The results of these trials are given in Table 1. They are not an accurate measure of prevalence of LGB people as it can be seen that the mode of administration affects the responses given. The mode of completion was by compulsory self-completion, by computer aided self-administered interviewing (CASI) 1 Category 2 is where the topic is under consideration and some questions, with further refinement, are included in the census, as compared to Category 1 questions where topics are likely to be included and Category 3 questions which are not included LGBT health  4or from an interviewer by computer aided personal interviewing (CAPI). However, the results suggest that approximately 3-8% of the population would not describe themselves as heterosexual or straight.  Table 1.

It is interesting to note that an included systematic review of 25 comparative studies from a variety of countries including USA and UK had a total number of participants of 214,344 and LGB participants of 11,971, giving a proportion of 5.6%.19  If there are approximately 6% LGB people in the population, this would mean that in England, where the total population is approximately 50 million, there are approximately 3 million LGB people and in the UK, where the total population is approximately 60 million, there are approximately 3.6 million LGB people.   It is likely that LGB people migrate to major urban centres, particularly London but also including Birmingham so it is likely that the proportion of LGB people in some LGBT health  5parts of the West Midlands is considerably higher than 6%, although there is no UK evidence as yet to confirm or refute this.   It is also useful to note that there are known to be approximately 31,000 MSM with HIV/AIDS in the UK.20 If there are 1.8 million gay men in the UK, the proportion with HIV/AIDS is approximately 1.7%.   Very little has been done so far to give an accurate estimate of the proportion of trans/transgender people in the UK population so there are no reliable UK estimates.11 At the moment it is suggested that there are approximately 5,000 transsexual people in the UK,11 but this may be misleading and approximately 1,000 new cases present each year for evaluation and support (personal communication C Burns, Plain Sense Ltd, January 2009).  2.2 Outcome measures used A wide variety of outcomes have been used to assess health in this report. In most cases, counts of presence or absence of an attribute have been used, for example, whether people smoke or not. Occasionally, questionnaire measures have been used, for example The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) or the Brief Symptom Inventory. All of the questionnaire measures have a scoring system so that a higher score is associated with worse health. Where questionnaires are used, the results can be given as continuous measures, or a threshold can be used where a person scoring above the threshold is counted as a case of the condition that the questionnaire measures.   2.3 Reason for the review Until now, most published research on gay and bisexual men has been about HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. There has been very little research on lesbians and bisexual women, apparently because HIV/AIDS is not considered to be an important issue. For trans people, medical research so far has focused exclusively on transitioning, i.e. reassigning gender. However, it has been apparent in the LGBT community that there are a wide variety of other health issues that are LGBT health  6also important such as the impact of health behaviours, for example drinking and smoking, and the interface between health service delivery and the LGBT community. As a result, numerous surveys on a wide variety of health aspects have been conducted since the early 1990s, almost always by volunteers from the LGBT community. Unfortunately, almost all of these have only been available as reports and have never been widely disseminated or fully published in peer-review journals so the results have mostly not been accessible to healthcare decision-makers. Because of this, there has been widespread ignorance outside the LGBT community about LGBT healthcare needs. Where some information has reached some healthcare decision-makers, it has not been of sufficient quality or quantity to change current practice. A noticeable exception was the systematic review by Professor King and colleagues on mental disorders, suicide and self-harm in LGB people.19 This resulted in Professor Louis Appleby (National Director for Mental Health) including sexual orientation into the National Suicide Prevention Strategy.21   There has been a considerable amount of research conducted in the USA on LGBT populations and numerous publications are readily available. Several other countries have also conducted and published LGBT health research. However, the findings have not been translated into healthcare provision in the UK. There may be a wide variety of reasons for this including unfamiliarity with the research and uncertainty around the generalisability of non-UK research to the UK setting.   There have been no systematic reviews of UK-specific LGBT healthcare research. The aim of this systematic review is to bring together unpublished research from the West Midlands and compare it to relevant UK research on the health of the LGBT population, and to the English or UK population as a whole, in order to determine:  • Local trends in health, health behaviours and experience of healthcare – to drive future service provision • Potentially missing information - to drive future local and national research priorities • A benchmark – to help indicate generalisability of research from abroad A cut–off date of the year 2000 has been chosen in order to focus on the most recent research available. HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection research has been LGBT health  7excluded from the systematic review in order to be able to focus on all of the other health areas relevant to the LGBT population.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW 3.1 Review methods  A protocol was developed and circulated to NHS and academic colleagues for comments.   3.1.1 Search strategy  Database search strategies were developed by an experienced information specialist and a LGBT health expert. Reviews and primary studies were sought (see Table 2). Only English language studies were sought because of the focus of the review. A very sensitive search was conducted in order to find as many published UK studies as possible. Cut-off dates were earlier than 2000 in order to bring in any useful background information or publications describing studies planned but yet to be conducted. See Appendix 1 for complete search strategies and website addresses.  Table 2.

The first criteria were for surveys reporting on the health, health behaviours or experience of healthcare in the West Midlands region. The second were for relevant systematic reviews and the third for relevant published primary quantitative or qualitative studies.  Inclusion criteria 1 - for West Midlands research Study Design: Any (mostly grey literature) conducted from 2000 onwards (recruitment date of all or majority of participants, if known) Population: LGBT in the West Midlands.

LGBT health  113.1.3 Study identification strategy All identified citations (titles ± abstracts) were screened by two reviewers for duplicates and inclusion according to all three sets of inclusion criteria. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. One reviewer applied the inclusion criteria to the full texts of all obtained articles. These were checked by a second reviewer and disagreements resolved through discussion.  3.1.4 Quality assessment and data extraction strategies – quantitative review Quality assessment of included surveys was initially based on a generic quality assessment checklist developed by NICE Centre for Public Health Excellence. Quality assessment of the included studies was implemented by one reviewer. Quality Assessment of all other study designs was by using the CASP critical appraisal checklists.22 Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second. Data extraction was from journal articles direct to report tables rather than using a data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.  3.1.5 Data analysis strategy – quantitative review Study characteristics and results were tabulated and collated in summary tables, organised by ICD-10 category and discussed narratively. ICD-10 categorisation was used because it is an internationally recognised classification of diseases. Results were interpreted in light of methodological strengths and weaknesses identified in quality assessment. Results were not meta-analysed because the included studies were low in the hierarchy of evidence and there was clinical heterogeneity between studies so meta-analysis could be misleading. Results were mostly compared to routinely collected data. Discussion of these data sources can be found in Appendix 2.  LGBT health  123.1.6 Quality assessment, data extraction and data analysis strategy – qualitative review Quality assessment of qualitative studies continues to be an area of controversy. Many checklists have been developed for use but, as yet, none have been well validated. The checklist used in the current work23 was selected due to recommendation by an expert in the area of qualitative research. Quality assessment of the included studies was implemented by one reviewer.  Despite using a checklist that was considered to provide a reasonable assessment of study quality, there were still likely to be areas of uncertainty. This is not only due to the ability of the checklist to pick up areas of bias but also due to uncertainty related to the question: what is a good piece of qualitative research? Therefore, rather than looking to assign a particular ‘score’ to each study, it was thought to be more important to consider each piece of research in light of factors that may promote bias and decide whether the research findings would be of interest and relevance to the reader.   The perspective of the researcher is highlighted as an important factor in all types of qualitative research. This is likely to consciously, or subconsciously, affect the way that the investigator plans and conducts the work and may result in particular topics being covered or certain attitudes being brought out. Transparency about researcher perspective is important and allows more detailed consideration of potential bias.   Qualitative information on experiences of LGB healthcare from the point of view of patients and professionals was extracted. Synthesis was conducted using an approach similar to meta-ethnography but involving both first order concepts (expressions of participants) and second order concepts (interpretations or explanations by researchers of included studies) in thematic analysis. Themes were identified by reading the included studies. Papers were re-read and relevant concepts were grouped under these themes for narrative discussion. Synthesis was undertaken by a researcher who has no particular theoretical approach to qualitative research or LGBT health. Data extraction and thematic synthesis was conducted by one reviewer. Another reviewer read papers and checked findings for consistency.  LGBT health  13Results  3.1.7 Quantity and quality of research available  From the searches, there were 2,603 citations identified of which 714 were duplicates, giving 1,889 citations of which 233 papers and reports were retrieved for assessment. Finally included in this systematic review were nine surveys from the West Midlands, two systematic reviews, 11 quantitative research reports and 14 qualitative research reports (See Figure 1). Details of studies excluded at the full text stage and reasons for exclusion are given in Appendix 3.   Details of the included West Midlands surveys, systematic reviews and primary quantitative research are given below and in Appendix 4. Details of the included qualitative studies and their presentation are given in Section 3.1.11 and in Appendix 4. Results of all of the included quantitative studies are presented together and categorised according to ICD-10 headings (e.g. A,B – certain infectious and parasitic diseases, CD - Neoplasms etc, see Section 3.1.9 onwards). Within each heading, results for the West Midlands surveys are presented first, then any results from systematic reviews and then any results from published primary studies. If more than one study in each of the three categories (West Midlands surveys, systematic reviews, primary studies) has reported the same outcome, quantitative results are presented in order of date of publication. The results tables specify questions asked in the surveys. Unless otherwise stated, the percentages given refer to the proportion agreeing with the question.   Some of the LGBT studies had comparator or control groups. Where there were no comparator results, LGBT survey results are compared to equivalent results from the general population, using information from the best quality surveys or cohort studies found. These general population studies are discussed in Appendix 2.

Quorom diagram of study selection   3.1.8 Quantitative systematic review results 3.1.8.1 West Midlands surveys  Five of the included surveys were conducted in the West Midlands, either by volunteers or by paid researchers or a combination of the two. The four other surveys were West Midlands subsets of findings from larger research projects covering the UK.   The Measure for Measure (2002) survey24 was conducted by Paul Sanderson who was then the Regional MSM Advisor for the West Midlands, with assistance from Gay Men’s service providers, Staffordshire University and Dr Gary Wood from Birmingham University. The report was never published and the findings were obtained as a PowerPoint presentation and a printout from an Excel spreadsheet. A Matter of Trust (2002)25 was commissioned by the Birmingham Police Forum for the  14LGBT health  15Gay Community and was conducted by Gudrun Limbrick (an independent researcher) and by volunteers. Its primary focus was on policing issues but it also included some health research. Making Visible the Invisible (2002)26 was a MA thesis by Yvette Summers that was subsequently turned into a report on the Space Project (a project between Sandwell Health Authority and Sandwell Regeneration Partnership to be an advocate for the local young LGB community). The LGBT Census Wolverhampton (2005)27 was commissioned by the LGBT Network Wolverhampton and conducted by Gudrun Limbrick. Measure for Measure II (2005)8 was commissioned by West Midlands South Strategic Health Authority and conducted by Paul Sanderson, the then Sexual Health Programme Lead, and Dr Emily Buckley from Staffordshire University. None of these reports have ISBN numbers and all are very difficult to obtain. Most were obtained directly from the authors.   Vital Statistics 2004,28 200529 and 200630 were regional subsets from the Gay Men’s Sex Surveys that are conducted annually by Sigma Research and are available on their website (www.sigmaresearch.org.uk). Sigma Research is a social research group, linked to the University of Portsmouth and it specialises in the behavioural and policy aspects of HIV and sexual health. It also undertakes research and development work on aspects of lesbian, gay and bisexual health and well-being. It has undertaken more than seventy research and development projects and most of its reports have ISBN numbers. Although the Gay Men’s Sex Survey is principally about sexual health, each year it does include some more general health information but not necessarily the same questions each year. None of the Sigma Research reports on their website are peer reviewed (Personal communication, Ford Hickson, Sigma Research, Sept 2008). The regional subsets were made available in February and March 2008. Prescription for Change (2008)31 was commissioned by Stonewall, a charity specialising in campaigning and lobbying for the LGB community in the UK. The research was conducted by Ruth Hunt from Stonewall and Dr Julie Fish from De Montfort University, Leicester. It does not have an ISBN number, has not been peer-reviewed (Personal communication, R Hunt, Stonewall, Aug 2008) has not been fully published (as yet) but the full report is currently on the Stonewall England website (www.stonewall.org.uk). The full report and regional subsets32 are also available on LGBT health  16the Sigma Research website. Outcomes measured in the nine West Midlands surveys are listed in Table 3 below.  Table 3.

Women   3.1.8.2 Systematic reviews: Two systematic reviews were included and they are listed in Table 4. The first was subsidised by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and provided an overview of research on lesbian parenthood for legal and policy reasons.33 It includes 44 qualitative and quantitative studies on lesbian families, published between 1978 and 2003, but only a small amount of information on health and well-being. Most of the studies were interviews or cross sectional surveys and two were based in the UK. The second systematic review was funded by a grant from the National Institute for Mental Health England and focused on LGB mental health.19 It included 25 cohort or cross-sectional surveys comparing LGB people to concurrent heterosexual comparison groups, published between 1998 and 2005, and one was based in the UK. Critical appraisal of these systematic reviews is in Appendix 5.  Table 4. Systematic review details Systematic review Topic  Men, women or both  Bos et al. 2005 Family functioning (comparison of lesbian families with child born in a previous heterosexual relationship to planned lesbian families) – child development, child’s sexual orientation, child’s emotional/behavioural development and social relationships, mother’s psychological health.

Results for both together, and men and women separately.   3.1.8.3 Quantitative primary research: Only eleven peer-reviewed and published quantitative research reports since 2000 were found on LGB health in the UK (see Table 5). No peer-reviewed and published quantitative research reports on any aspect of trans health outside transitioning were LGBT health  18found. There is an uneven spread of LGB topics covered, mainly health behaviours, vaccination and mental health. Two were case control studies (Das,34 Rivers35), one was a case series of a smoking cessation intervention (Harding36) and three were cross-sectional surveys comparing LGB people (using various definitions of identity and behaviour) to heterosexuals (Agrawal,37 McNamee,38 Mercer7). The remaining five were surveys of gay men (Bolding 2002,39 Bolding 2006,40 O’Riordan41), bisexuals (Barker42) and both lesbians and gay men (Warner43). None were published in high impact journals2 – the highest impact factors were probably for the articles published in Addiction (~4), Fertility and Sterility (~3) and Vaccine (~3). Study sizes varied between 92 (Barker) and 5,772 (Mercer). Only one study categorised participants by sexual behaviour rather than identity (Mercer). Critical appraisal of primary studies is in Appendix 5.  Table 5.

These are given in Table 6 (West Midlands surveys), Table 7 and Table 8 (published primary studies). Rates of these categories in the general population are 74% in very good or good health, 7% in very bad or bad health and 46% with at least one longstanding illness.44 The results suggest that it is difficult to determine whether there are higher rates of poor health in the LGB population but there seem to be fewer with longstanding illnesses.   With regard to proportions of people taking prescribed medicines in the general population, in the Health Survey for England 45.4% were taking any medicines prescribed by a doctor and 42.8% were taking prescribed medicines excluding contraceptives45 suggesting that fewer LGB people were taking prescribed medication.

HIV and sexually transmitted diseases were specifically excluded from this systematic review.  3.1.9.3 C,D – Neoplasms, diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs and certain disorders involving the immune mechanism Cancer The only information on cancer in the UK LGBT population was found in one of the West Midlands surveys – Measure for Measure II (2005) which found that 2% of respondents said ‘Yes’ to the question – Do you suffer from cancer? This compares to an annual incidence of approximately 0.5% in the general population46 and an estimated prevalence of cancer in England of 0.3%.47   3.1.9.4 E – Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases The only information on diabetes in the UK LGBT population was found in one of the West Midlands surveys – Measure for Measure II (2005) which found that 3% of respondents said yes to the question – Do you suffer from diabetes? This compares to an estimated 4.5% type 1 and 2 diabetes in the general population.44  3.1.9.5 F – Mental and behavioural disorders There was much more information available on mental health issues, particularly from the West Midlands surveys. There are also the results of the systematic review LGBT health  22on mental health, suicide and deliberate self harm. This mental health section is arranged in order of general mental health, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and psychosis, self harm, suicide and eating disorders.   General mental health The West Midlands surveys measured a variety of aspects of general mental health and many of these results are difficult to compare to rates that might be found in the general population (see Table 10). However, it has been estimated that 2.9% of the general population suffer from sleep problems48 suggesting a much higher rate of sleep problems of 27-66% in LGB people. The West Midlands survey results suggest a general level of poor mental health in the LGBT population.   The two published studies used two general validated measures of mental health – GHQ-12 and GHQ-28. McNamee et al. found a much higher rate of GHQ-12 cases (i.e. scored 4 or more) in same or both sex attracted participants (40.9%) when compared to opposite sex attracted participants (19.2%, see Table 11). This compares to a case rate in the general population of 11% in men and 15% in women.49 Warner et al. found that 16% (11/68) scored above the threshold on the GHQ-28 questionnaire. The scoring system and threshold used in this study were not stated, making comparisons with general population surveys very difficult so no comparison has been given here.   The systematic review by Bos et al. found that the overall mental health of lesbian mothers (for lesbians with children born in a previous heterosexual relationship and for planned lesbian families) was no different to heterosexual mothers.

This can be compared to an estimated annual rate of depression of 6% and lifetime rate of more than 15% in the general population.50 The systematic review by King et al. showed an approximate doubling of the risk of lifetime and 12 month depression in LGB people compared to controls and the results were all statistically significant and showed little heterogeneity (see Table 13). Rivers et al. (2008) measured depression within the Brief Symptom Inventory and mean results were 1.29 (SD 1.25) for same sex attracted compared with 0.60 (SD 0.81) for opposite sex attracted participants.

This can be compared to 4.4% for general anxiety disorder, 1.1% for obsessive-compulsive disorder and 0.5% for probable psychotic disorder in the general population.48 The systematic review by King et al. found approximately 1.5 times risk for 12 month anxiety in LGB people compared to the comparator groups (see Table 14). Rivers et al. (2008) measured anxiety within the Brief Symptom Inventory and mean results were 1.13 (SD 1.18) for same sex attracted and 0.50 (SD 0.70) for opposite sex attracted participants.

This can be compared to a lifetime suicidal thoughts rate of 14.9% and suicide LGBT health  26attempt rate of 4.4% in the general population.51 The equivalent 12 month rates in the general population were 3.9% and 0.5%.51 The systematic review by King et al. showed an approximate doubling of the risk of suicide attempts and ideation in LGB people compared to controls and the results were remarkably consistent and statistically significant for all comparisons (see Table 16). A random effects model was used throughout but there was high heterogeneity between studies in several of the comparisons.   Rivers et al. (2008) measured thoughts of ending life within the Brief Symptom Inventory and mean results were 1.02 (SD 1.52) for same sex attracted and 0.65 (SD 1.98) for opposite sex attracted participants.

The specific questions asked may indicate why the results varied from 4% to 21.6% (see Table 17). The latest survey (Prescription for Change West Midlands subset) may give a reasonable estimate of lifetime prevalence, in which case the rate is high at 21.6%. On the other hand, the LGBT Census and Measure for Measure II surveys may be giving an estimate of point prevalence. The results can be compared to a rate in the general population for anorexia nervosa of 19 per 100,000 in women and 2 per 100,000 in men, for bulimia of between 0.5-1% in young women and 0.05-0.1% in young men and for binge eating disorder of approximately 1.7% in women.52 This suggests that the LGBT rates of eating disorder, particularly in men, are very high.   In the published studies, McNamee et al. (2008) found that 19.5% of the opposite sex attracted group compared to 31.9% of the same/both sex attracted group of LGBT health  28young people felt pressurised to lose weight. Rivers et al. (2008) found no statistical differences between same sex and opposite sex attracted school children in concerns about looks and/or dress, weight, size or body shape but the numbers were not reported.

This compares to 6.5% for men and 4% for women in the general population.44 3.1.9.9 J – Diseases of the respiratory system The only information on any respiratory diseases in the UK LGBT population was found in one of the West Midlands surveys – Measure for Measure II (2005) which LGBT health  29found that 13% of respondents said ‘Yes’ to the question – Do you suffer from asthma? This compares to the lifetime prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma of 13% in men and 16% in women in the general population.55 3.1.9.10 K – Diseases of the digestive system There was no information available on any diseases of the digestive system in the UK LGBT population. 3.1.9.11 L – Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue There was no information available on any diseases of the skin or subcutaneous system in the UK LGBT population. 3.1.9.12 M – Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue The only information on musculoskeletal conditions in the UK LGBT population was found in one of the West Midlands surveys – Measure for Measure II (2005) which found that 6% of respondents said Yes to the question – Do you suffer from arthritis? The prevalence of arthritis and rheumatism in the general population increases rapidly with age, the prevalence up to age 44 is less than 2.5% and for 45-54 year olds is around 6%.56 3.1.9.13 N – Diseases of the genitourinary system There was no information available on any diseases of the genitourinary system in the UK LGBT population. 3.1.9.14 O – Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium None of the West Midlands surveys included questions on this topic.   Agrawal et al. (2004) investigated polycystic ovary syndrome (a major cause of infertility) in lesbian compared to heterosexual women attending a London fertility clinic between 2001 and 2003. The two groups were of similar age but the lesbians had slightly higher BMI. With regard to baseline characteristics of the two samples, there was a significantly higher mean ovarian volume in lesbians and a higher percentage of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, acne, hirsutism, and polycystic ovary syndrome.   LGBT health  30Table 18.

There were higher levels of testosterone, androstenedione and free androgen index in lesbians with polycystic ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome compared to heterosexual women with these conditions, results for women with normal ovaries were not reported.  3.1.9.15 P – Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period and Q – Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities There was no information available on any of these subjects in the UK LGBT population. 3.1.9.16 R – Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified There was no information available on any of these subjects in the UK LGBT population. 3.1.9.17 S,T – Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes There was no specific information on injury and poisoning available. However, there was information on domestic violence and this can lead to injury so has been presented here. The three West Midlands surveys to report this suggested that there were relatively high rates of 24-35% (see Table 19). These rates can be compared to LGBT health  31the rate of partner abuse since aged 16 (including stalking) in the general population of 23.7%.57 Table 19.

There is however, some information on deliberate self harm. The results indicate high rates in all three West Midlands surveys to report this (16-35%, see Table 20). The rates can be compared to an estimated rate of deliberate self harm without suicidal intent in the general public of 2.4%.51 The systematic review by King et al. showed an increased risk of deliberate self harm in LGB people compared to controls but the results were only statistically significant for women (see Table 21).

These include body mass index (BMI), exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption and illegal or recreational drug use.   Weight (BMI) Three West Midlands surveys measured BMI. In Measure for Measure II (2005) the average BMI for the participants giving height and weight (n= 627 men (89.2% of whole sample) and 139 women (139 of whole sample)) was 24.7kg/m2 (range 14.6 to 61.2 kg/m2). The BMI category results are given in Table 22 and suggest that there is a relatively low proportion of obese LGB people, particularly men. Equivalent whole population BMI results are 1.4% underweight, 35.2% normal weight, 38.3% overweight and 25.0% obese.44  LGBT health  33Table 22.

This compares to 40% of men and 28% of women in the general population who met the minimum recommendation for physical activity in adults (moderate intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 30 minutes five days a week).58 However, in the West Midlands, another study found that 19.3% of people participated in 30 minutes of moderate exercise for 3 days per week in 2005/6, compared to the national average of 21%.59  Diet  Measure for Measure II (2005) found that 8% ate less than one portion of fruit and vegetables per day, 40% between 1-2 portions, 30% between 3-4 portions and 17% ate five or more portions per day. Also, participants who were normal or underweight were significantly more likely to eat fewer than the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. This can be compared to the general population where 9% eat less than one portion, 32% eat 1-2 portions, 31% eat 3-4 portions and 30% eat five or more portions per day.44  LGBT health  34Smoking Seven of the West Midlands surveys asked a variety of questions around smoking habits and attempts to quit (see Table 23). The results suggest that there is a high current and lifetime prevalence of smoking in LGB people. Also, a relatively high proportion had attempted to quit and a relatively high proportion of quitters gave up without assistance. The current smoking rates shown below of 54.1% in 2002 and 28.7% in 2008 compare to rates in the general population of 22% current smokers and 26% who used to smoke cigarettes regularly.44   Four of the published papers also gave information about smoking rates. Bolding et al. (2002) found that 23.4% smoked regularly – a relatively low proportion but this was a sample of gay men attending gyms so would be expected to have a lower prevalence of smoking. McNamee et al. (2008) found that 31.4% of same/both sex attracted students, compared to 21.7% of opposite sex attracted students felt pressurised to smoke cigarettes. Mercer et al. found that WSMW had higher rates of smoking than WSM and WSW (see Table 24). Rivers et al. (2008) did not report smoking rates measured but mentioned that there was no significant difference between same sex and opposite sex attracted school children in smoking rates, with the majority never having smoked.   Harding et al. (2004) was the only treatment-orientated study available and was a case series on smoking cessation. Results were reported for 69 gay men. At the start of the study the daily number of cigarettes smoked in the quit sample were 1-5 = 4%, 5-10 = 7%, 11-20 = 39.9%, 21-30 = 30%, 31-40 = 12% and 41 or more = 7%. The time to first cigarette after waking was 5 minutes = 28%, 6-30 minutes = 45%, 31-60 minutes = 10% and more than an hour = 16%. 90% had made a previous attempt to quit, and the mean quit attempts of those who had attempted to quit was 2.85 (SD 1.4). Previously used nicotine replacement methods were gum (49%), patches (49%), nasal spray (5%), inhaler (20%), microtabs (5%), lozenges (7%) and bupropion (20%). Only 51% had been recommended to quit by their GP. At session 3, 58 out of 69 men (84.1%), set a quit date and at week 7, 44 men (75.9% of those who set a quit date) were confirmed as having quit by use of a carbon monoxide monitor. An additional three reported by telephone that they had quit. There was no LGBT health  35long-term follow up. Equivalent quit rates for standard smoking cessation groups are that 52% of men who set a quit date had successfully quit at 4 weeks follow up.60  Table 23.

The results suggest that there is a high level of alcohol consumption in the LGB population and that there is some concern about the levels of consumption (see Table 25). In the general population 72% of men and 58% of women had drunk alcohol in the previous week and 41% of men and 33% of women had drunk more than the recommended daily amount on at least one day in the previous week.58  The systematic review by King et al. suggested that the 12 month relative risk of alcohol dependence is twice the rate in LGB people compared to control groups. It may be as high as four times the rate in lesbian and bisexual women (see Table 26).   Five of the published papers also measured alcohol consumption. Bolding et al. (2002) found that 51.2% of gay men attending London gyms drank alcohol regularly. Harding et al. found that 94% of the sample of gay men quitting smoking drank alcohol, with a mean 22.8 units/week (median 20 SD 19, range 1-120). McNamee et al. (2008) found that 40.6% of same/both sex attracted participants compared to 27.8% of opposite sex attracted participants felt pressurised to drink alcohol. Mercer et al. (2007) found a higher rate of alcohol consumption, more than the recommended limit in WSMW, and to a lesser extent in WSW than WSM (see Table 27). Rivers et al. (2008) found that same-sex attracted school children reported consuming a mean of 1.2 units of alcohol in the previous seven days (SD 2.4) compared to 2.5 units (SD 7.28) for opposite sex attracted school children. There LGBT health  37was a significant increase for opposite sex attracted school children compared to same sex attracted school children in the frequency of alcohol consumption during the week.

Five West Midlands surveys asked questions about illegal or recreational drug use. The results suggest that a relatively high proportion of LGB people use drugs (19-35%, see Table 28), which can be compared to a lifetime experience of illegal drug use of 27% (21% women and 32% men) in the general population and in the last year of 11% (8% women, 13% men).48    LGBT health  39The systematic review by King et al. found an approximately 2.5 times higher risk of 12 month drug dependence in LGB people compared to controls (see Table 29). The review also found a slightly higher 12 month and lifetime risk of any substance use disorder but this was not statistically significantly higher for 12 month risk of any substance use disorder in men.   Two published studies investigated general drug use. McNamee et al. (2008) found that 14.7% of same/both sex attracted students compared to 8.4% of opposite sex attracted students felt pressurised to take illegal drugs. Mercer et al. found higher rates of injected non-prescribed drug use in WSMW compared to the other two groups (see Table 30).  Table 28.

Some results were given for men and women separately (see Table 32 and Table 33). They show that cannabis and nitrates were the most popular drugs and that there was not much difference in drug use between men and women. In Measure for Measure II (2005), 10% of men and only one woman reported using both Viagra and amyl nitrate – a dangerous combination, but it was not possible to determine whether the two drugs were being used at the same time in the month. Comparator substance use from the general population are given in Table 31, Table 32 and Table 32.48  LGBT health  41Three published papers (Bolding et al. 2002, Bolding et al. 2006 and Rivers et al. 2008) also gave percentages of participants using a variety of specific drugs (see Table 34). The percentage using steroids was particularly high in the gay men attending London gyms. Results for Rivers et al. (2008) for cannabis/marijuana can be seen in Table 34. In this study both 10% of same sex and opposite sex attracted participants had ever smoked cannabis/marijuana on school premises. Also no significant differences were found in exposure to cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, ecstasy or inhaled glue, aerosols, paint or nail polish.   The study by Singleton et al.48 gives some estimated rates of illegal/recreational drug use in the general population. These have been given in Table 31, Table 32 and Table 33 for ease of comparison.  Table 31.

General practice Four of the West Midlands surveys investigated the interaction between participants and their GPs (see Table 35). They suggest that a relatively high proportion of LGB people are registered with GPs (90%) but the proportion out to their GP (i.e. disclosed their sexual orientation) is much lower, at between 42-51%. Also, surveys suggest that approximately 10% of GPs were not gay-friendly. In the LGBT Census Wolverhampton (2005) (in-depth subset), the reasons given for not being out to the GP were: 53% - “the subject hasn’t come up”, 32% - “its not relevant”, 13% - “I am worried about how they might react”, 8% - “I’m too embarrassed to talk about it”, 5% - “I’m worried about confidentiality”. In Measure for Measure II (2005) the most common reasons given by the 10% participants not being registered with a GP were LGBT health  4422% having recently moved, 21% because they were not ill and 17% because they could not find a gay-friendly GP.   One published paper on smoking cessation (Harding et al., 2004) found that their male participants had had a mean of 2.6 Consultations with their GPs in previous year (SD 3.5). This can be compared to an average GP consultation rate in men of 3.5 per year.61  Table 35. West Midlands surveys – registered with GP/out to GP/GP gay-friendly?

Yes = 22.5% Not sure = 12.3% LGBT health  45GP surgery displayed non-discriminatory policy including sexual orientation?    9.1%  Mental health counselling  Five West Midlands surveys asked about mental health counselling (see Table 36). They found a high rate of access to mental health counselling (36- 40%), which is consistent with the high rates of mental health problems described previously in the LGB research. However, a relatively large proportion (~33%) had not found counselling beneficial. The rate of access to mental health counselling in the general population is approximately 2.4% (9% with mental health problems).48  Table 36.

It found that 30% of men and 21% of women had been vaccinated and 17% were unsure whether they had had this vaccination or not.   Riordan et al. audited a Hepatitis A vaccination policy in gay men attending a London clinic. They found that 46.6% (140/300) who were screened had seroprevalence of anti-Hepatitis A IgG (confidence interval 41%-52%). They reported that 49.9% of the whole sample (n=395) were offered vaccination on their first visit. The 50.1% LGBT health  46(n=198) who were not offered vaccination probably included the 140 men who were already seropositive and 52 with clear previous history of vaccination but it is unclear why the remaining 6 were not vaccinated. They report that HIV targets (from British Association of Sexual Health and HIV) were greater than 90% for screening and vaccination. There was a suggestion that, compared to previous research in 1998, there was a significant increase in overall seroprevalence from 35.9% to 46.6% in 2004. However, there were no details about the 1998 sample and how it was acquired other than the size – 384 people.   Hepatitis B vaccination Three West Midlands surveys recorded hepatitis B vaccination (see Table 37). The results suggest that approximately 50% of gay men were receiving vaccination by 2005.  Table 37. West Midlands surveys – hepatitis B vaccination Study  Question  Result  Measure for Measure (2002) Have you had a Hep B vaccination?  Full course = 41.8% Part course = 6.9% Unsure = 4.2% Missing = 10.7% LGBT Census Wolverhampton (2005) Hep B vaccination?  Yes – Men: 49% Yes – Women: 33% Unsure: 13% Measure for Measure II (2005) Hep B vaccination? Fully – men: 53% Partly – men: 5% Unsure – 9%  Das et al. (2003) conducted a case control study of the effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination in 104 gay men compared to 101 male and 131 female healthcare workers. The vaccinations were carried out at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital between 1995 and December 2000. For the 104 gay men, vaccination was complete in 85.6% and 85.4% of these returned for follow up. 44.5% had an adequate response. Of the 55.5% without an adequate response, two thirds had boosters. Of these, one third had an adequate response, one third remained inadequate and one third did not return for follow up.   For the control group of 101 male health workers, vaccination was complete in 100% and possibly all returned for follow up (unclear from paper). 71% had an adequate LGBT health  47response. Of the 29% without an adequate response, all had boosters. Of these, all but one returned for follow up and 64.2% developed adequate responses, the remainder having inadequate responses. 40% of these received a repeat course of vaccination. For the control group of 131 female health workers, vaccination was complete 100% and possibly all returned for follow up. 79% had an adequate response. Of the 21% without an adequate response, 92.6% had boosters of whom 84% then developed an adequate response. Therefore, after complete follow up, 75% of gay men, 97.9% of male health workers and 99.2% of female health workers achieved an adequate response.   Cancer screening – Breast self examination, mammography, cervical smear and testicular self-examination  Five of the West Midlands surveys recorded various cancer screening behaviours and these are listed in Table 38, Table 39, Table 40 and Table 41. The results for breast self examination suggested that 70-80% lesbians and bisexual women checked their breasts regularly. It is unclear what the current rate of breast self examination is in the general population due to the recent publications suggesting that there is no beneficial effect of self examination.62 For mammography, a very high proportion of eligible women (93%) attended the examination, which compares favourably with the 76% mammography coverage of eligible women in England.63 However, the latest West Midlands results for cervical screening (from a relatively large sample) suggested that only 56.4% attended regularly. This can be compared to 80% coverage in the eligible female population in England.63 For testicular self-examination, 72-84% of gay and bisexual men are checking themselves regularly – this can be compared to approximately 49% in the general male population.64  LGBT health  48Table 38.

In Vital Statistics (2006) West Midlands subset, when asked the question “I would like to be more involved with promoting the health of gay and bisexual men?”, 21.3% strongly agreed, 31.9% agreed and 34.3% were not sure (12.5% did not agree with the statement). In Prescription for Change (2008) West Midlands subset, only 0.5% had attended a specialist health service for lesbian and bisexual women. In Prescription LGBT health  50for Change (2008) West Midlands subset, 56.3% had any negative experiences of healthcare and 51.0% had any positive experiences of healthcare in the last year. For 41.8% of women the health worker assumed heterosexuality, for 26.0% there was no opportunity to discuss sexual orientation in the healthcare setting and for only 5.3% did the healthcare worker provide an opportunity to come out. There was an acknowledgement of sexuality by health worker after disclosure for 24.4% of women. For 7.9%, the healthcare worker still assumed heterosexuality, for 4.9% the healthcare worker asked inappropriate questions but for 24.6% the healthcare worker did not make inappropriate comments after disclosure. Only in 13.6% did the healthcare worker welcome the partner at the consultation and for 12.7% the healthcare worker gave advice accounting for sexuality.   Two published papers investigated other NHS interaction. Harding et al. (2004) found that 52% of gay male participants of a smoking cessation clinic sample had had secondary/hospital consultations in the previous year and that the mean number of consultations was 2.6 (SD 3.9). Mercer et al. found a higher rate of hospital inpatient visits in WSMW and a higher rate of hospital outpatient visits in WSW than WSM (see Table 42).  Table 42. Mercer et al – hospital inpatient and outpatient visits Reference Question  WSM  WSMW WSW Hospital outpatient visit in last year 26.5% 35.0% 40.8% Mercer et al. (2007) Hospital inpatient visit in last year 8.2% 13.0% 4.0%  3.1.10.1 Bisexual section Very few specific bisexual identity results were available. In the West Midlands survey A Matter of Trust (2002) the bisexual respondents (n= 49) reported the lowest incidence of mental health problems – although a third still had some mental health issues they related to their sexuality. Those who were unsure about their sexuality (n= 30) experienced the highest incidence – 67%.   LGBT health  51One published paper specifically recruited a bisexual sample (Barker et al. (2008). It found that 36% had single (24%) or multiple (12%) physical or mental health impairments that interfered with everyday life. These impairments were 12% unseen impairment (e.g. diabetes, epilepsy), 5% learning difficulty (e.g. dyslexia), 3% hearing impairment, 3% mobility impairment and 2% visual impairment. Of the sample, 25% had had a diagnosis of a mental health issue from a professional – 16% had depression, 8% anxiety, 8% had self harmed, 7% had seasonal adjustment disorder, 3% panic disorder, 3% post traumatic stress disorder, 2% bipolar disorder, 2% obsessive-compulsive disorder, 1% had an eating disorder and 1% had schizoaffective disorder. There was also one case of each of adult attention deficit disorder and Asperger’s syndrome. These percentages can be compared to rates in the general population of 15% lifetime rate of depression, 4.4% general anxiety disorder, 2.4% self-harm, 1.1% obsessive compulsive disorder, ~ 1% eating disorder and 0.5% probable psychotic disorder. Rates for panic disorder are approximately 7%48 and the rate of bipolar disorder is approximately half that of schizophrenia within the diagnosis of probable psychotic disorder.65 UK estimates for the prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder in the general population were not found.   3.1.10.2 Trans section The only trans-specific information available was from one of the West Midlands surveys. A Matter of Trust (2002) found that 4/7 (57%) of Trans respondents had experienced mental health problems.   3.1.11 Qualitative systematic review results Fourteen peer-reviewed, qualitative studies, published since 2000, were identified (see Table 43). There was no information on trans issues. The included qualitative studies related the experiences of both LGB patients and healthcare professionals. Most papers related issues of patient-healthcare worker communication and to areas of health service provision and all were conducted in the UK. No systematic reviews of qualitative research were included. Two of the West Midlands surveys included qualitative research (Making Visible the Invisible,26 A Matter of Trust25) and these findings have been included in this section.  LGBT health  52 Of the published studies, 10 recounted the experiences of LGB participants. Of these, four described experiences of LGB patients in general practice: three in adults66-68 and one in older adults.69 Another two studies described the experiences of therapeutic counselling of LGB participants70,71 one study described the experience of maternity care of lesbian women72 and one study described the experiences of gay men and lesbians who had undergone treatments for homosexuality.73 There was also one study that explored self-destructive behaviour and mental health in young people74 and one study that explored how mental health of lesbians related to workplace sexual identity.75  There were four studies related to practitioners, three of which were in straight and one in gay practitioners. Of these studies, one described GP’s perspectives on consultations with LGB patients,76 one described perspectives of GPs administering ‘treatments’ for homosexuality77 and one described the strategies used by LGB doctors to manage their identity in the clinical examination of patients.78 Another study examined the perceptions of teachers to homophobic bullying and included a small amount of information on health of the pupils.79  All studies used qualitative techniques to collect and analyse data. Twelve studies used one-to-one interviews: described in six studies as structured or semi structured interviews67,69,70,75,76,78,80 and in two as in-depth, unstructured interviews,73,77 the others were not described.66,74,79 Also, four studies used self-completion questionnaires68,70,72,79 whilst two involved focus groups.66,68  The number of participants varied between studies, the largest study being in 307 teachers and the smallest in 10 older gay men. However, the majority contained a similar number of participants, around 20-50 respondents (see Table 43).   The focus of the included studies varied (see Table 42). Some were more relevant to the aims of this review and inevitably contained more concepts that were related to LGBT experiences of healthcare. These studies therefore contributed more to the generation of themes and feature more highly in thematic discussion. LGBT health  53Since limited qualitative data was available from West Midlands surveys, discussion of qualitative findings relates to all UK studies. It was considered that findings would be reasonably generalisable to the West Midlands area.   LGBT health Table 43.

The issues that were addressed included the sexual orientation of the researcher, considerations around researcher bias and appropriate methods of data collection.  In the current systematic review, ideological perspective may be a particularly important factor. The extent to which the sexuality of the investigator impacted their approach was difficult to judge. In some of the studies, researchers were explicit about their sexuality (they were gay or lesbian researchers)67,70,80 but, in other studies, no reference to researcher sexuality was made. Attitudes expressed by study participants may have been influenced by the sexuality of investigators but influences may have been positive as well as negative. For example, a homosexual researcher may encourage negative experiences of homophobia to be related and this may be detrimental to the study, giving a biased representation of healthcare treatment. However, it could be argued that a participant who knows that their interviewer is also LGB may be more likely to answer honestly, feeling freer in discussing their experiences and providing more informative responses.   The extent to which the data presented in publications represents what was related by participants (reflexivity) is an important consideration. Where a researcher approaches work from a particular perspective and is not open to different ideas and concepts this may be a concern since results may appear very different depending on what information is selected for inclusion in study reports. Although the qualitative checklist to some extent seeks to assess this characteristic (‘Are the findings substantiated by the data…’), in reality this is difficult to assess and relies upon the thoroughness of the investigator. Their honesty and ethical approach are vital so that a true representation of what was related is presented in reports and publications. In the current review, there is nothing to suggest that researchers were misleading in their presentation of results but no judgement could be made that results were truly representative of patient perspectives.   There may be some debate as to the best method for data collection. In some cases, where particular topics are to be discussed, the use of structured interviews may be appropriate and guide useful discussion. However, in other cases, where general  56LGBT health opinions are sought, this may act to ‘lead’ discussion and even bias the views expressed. In the current review, where structured interviews were used, they were generally thought to be justified since these studies were seeking to investigate particular areas of interest. Equally, the appropriateness of interviews versus focus groups for this type of work may be debated. Interviews may give more independent responses, unbiased by inputs of other study participants or the research facilitator. However, where general issues are to be explored and ideas generated for discussion, focus groups may provide a valuable setting. In the current review, although the majority of investigators chose to conduct interviews, some used focus groups and each of these approaches was likely to bring with it positive and negative impacts on the research.  Problems in achieving transparency in qualitative research make quality assessment an extremely difficult task. The potential for investigator bias is high and readers may struggle to assess to what extent studies relate real perspectives. However, in the current work, with an awareness of the important issues involved, these studies are likely to be rich sources of information; giving attitudes and perspectives and providing insight into the thoughts and feelings of LGB individuals.   3.1.12 Qualitative study findings The quantitative part of this systematic review brings together available published quantitative literature on health behaviours of LGBT people in the UK whilst this part of the review summarises qualitative literature on health behaviours. The included studies provided a small amount of information on health behaviours and treatment and a larger body of evidence relating to perceptions and experiences of barriers to healthcare. The following review of qualitative material therefore gives an initial brief summary of health behaviours before discussing, in more detail, the identified barriers to healthcare: relationship barriers and institutional barriers. A table in Appendix 6 summarises the sources for each of the identified themes. In the text, “Italics” are used to identify concepts from study participants and ‘single quotation marks’ identify concepts of study authors.   57LGBT health 3.1.12.1 Health behaviours In the qualitative literature, homosexuality was identified as being associated with self-destructive behaviour, such as self-harm, suicide, experimentation with relationships and anorexia.68,74 It was also associated with depression, unhappiness, lack of confidence, feelings of isolation and a general psychological burden.74,75 The LGB social scene was discussed in relation to the high levels of smoking and alcohol in that setting68,69 and a feeling was expressed that, for those not interested in being part of the clubbing ‘scene’, there were few other opportunities to be part of social networks.69 These qualitative studies suggested that some, but not all, LGB individuals, came out to their GPs and many did not discuss sexual health;67,68 for some, fear of disclosure came from negative experiences earlier in life.66  3.1.12.2 Barriers to good healthcare Although LGB individuals may be a vulnerable group; experiencing poor mental health and influenced by a social ‘scene’ that advocates high consumption of drugs and alcohol, the qualitative literature reviewed suggested strongly that there was inadequate healthcare support. In this systematic review, barriers in healthcare have been categorised as barriers in relationships between healthcare professionals and LGB patients and as institutional barriers affecting the whole health service (studies related to each theme listed in appendix 7).   Relationship barriers An issue highlighted in the majority of qualitative studies reviewed was poor communication between healthcare workers and LGB patients. In a study of GPs, almost half of the doctors reported barriers to discussing sexual health needs with non-heterosexual patients.76 There may be many reasons for these barriers and, in the studies reviewed, the following themes were identified as important predictors of the healthcare professional-patient relationship (indication given of whether perspectives are largely from patients or healthcare professionals): - Homophobia: Conferred and internalised (patients and professionals) - Heterosexist assumptions (patients) - Lack of professional approach (patients) - Lack of knowledge (patients and professionals) - Misunderstandings (patients)  58LGBT health - Being over-cautious (patients and professionals) - The importance of affirmation (patients)  Homophobia: conferred and internalised Homophobia describes explicit or implicit negative treatment or attitudes towards homosexual people. It may be present in heterosexual people (described here as conferred homophobia) or it may be present in homosexual people themselves (described here as internalised homophobia).  Conferred Homophobia In studies of the current review, LGB respondents frequently cited examples of homophobia they experienced in the healthcare setting. One lesbian mother reported that “Homophobia was very apparent in hospital”72 whilst lesbian and gay participants in another study described medical staff as having been “judgemental”, “patronising”, “intrusive” or “rude” and having shown “lack of respect”.68   Although homophobia sometimes took the form of avoidance: “He couldn’t get near men!....he wouldn’t touch me. I haven’t been there since” (Jason, gay man),69 it was sometimes more directly harmful. An older gay man reported of his GP that “He simply told me that if I don’t feel life’s worth living that’s up to me what I do” (Andy)69 whilst, in another study one female informant reported undergoing physically rough treatment.68 The direct physical abuse and lack of support for a patient with suicidal intentions are clearly unacceptable.   There is a history of a certain amount of homophobia in the medical profession. Until the mid to late 20th century, homosexuality was considered a medical condition that should be treated and doctors were encouraged to ‘cure’ homosexuality.77 Experiments were normally conducted on men and the most common ‘treatment’ included aversion therapy, where electric shocks were associated with same sex attraction in order to change sexual orientation.77 Recently, investigators have researched the effects of these treatments on the doctors who administered them77 and the patients who were treated.73 In the accounts of practitioners, a clear theme was that, at the time of treatment, there was an absence of awareness that these  59LGBT health treatments were inappropriate: “You never thought about the morality of what you were doing.” (Clinical psychologist)  The fact that the homosexual act was a criminal offence at that time enforced the ‘normal’ attitude that this was a disease to be cured. Doctors were “not aware of any particular ethical difficulty” (clinical psychologist)77 and “dealing with it by ameliorating their social background, rather than dealing with their sexual orientation, hadn’t really occurred to any of us, certainly not me” (clinical psychologist).77 One participant summarised that: “that’s just part of the horror stories of the 1950s and 60s of general homophobia”.77  Cultural norms may have played a large role in dictating real and conveyed attitudes towards people of different sexual orientations. One physician clearly still held the opinion that homosexuality was a disease to be treated: “I thought they [homosexuals] were people who were disordered and needed treatment and psychiatric help. And I still do” (clinical psychologist)77 but most subsequently questioned their own actions: “I feel a lot of shame. I don’t think I’ve ever spoken about it since then apart from now.” (clinical psychologist).77  A small number of physicians however, despite regretting treatments, maintained that they were acceptable and useful, relating the success of someone being “completely cured” and another “getting better” (psychiatrist) and of patients becoming “satisfactorily heterosexual” (clinical psychologist).77 The attitude that homosexuality was a disease to be treated may to some extent still prevail since, although aggressive homophobia is generally considered unacceptable, attitudes of a heterosexual ideal may still remain. This manifests itself in a prevailing culture of heterosexism (see below).  There has been a rapid change over the last 50 years, with the decriminalisation of some homosexual acts in 1967 and the removal of homosexuality from the ICD-10 in 1992.73 However, with the influence of a homophobic past in the medical profession, some clinicians still appear to hold negative views of homosexuality. In another study, investigating the views of GPs, one doctor was open about his distaste for homosexual sex: “I think exposure to different practices one wouldn’t subscribe to – no, let’s personalise this one – which I wouldn’t subscribe to, and some of which I  60LGBT health find personally repugnant in some ways” (GP, male, age 42 years)76 and another was explicit about his own homophobia: “prescribing Viagra for homosexual men….but it’s probably my prejudices, I’m prepared to admit that…..I don’t see it’s appropriate” (GP, male, age 50 years).76 This GP may have made treatment decisions on the basis of his personal opinions, something that is not acceptable whatever his beliefs. However, his openness to his own motivations did suggest the possibility of change and recognition that his treatment was not systematic and fair.   Other homophobia may be less explicit. In the same study, one GP made the comment, in the context of achieving good patient communication, that: “if they don’t understand what we would say is the normal phrase or clean phrase then I would go and use whatever words they use to refer to their sex act as….what one person might say is making love might not be the same as what we believe” (GP male, age 37 years).76 Despite this GP’s attempts to overcome communication barriers, there was the suggestion of homophobia. Words that he might have chosen to describe heterosexual sex he referred to as “clean” and “normal” with the implication that words describing homosexual sex were dirty and abnormal. Personal opinion was also suggested where he referred to “their sex act” and comments that homosexual sex may not be believed to be “making love”. It appeared that his attempts to aid communication were somewhat undermined by his apparent underlying homophobia.  Internalised homophobia Perspectives from studies in the current review suggested that the presence of homophobia may not be restricted to heterosexual people. Mair conducted qualitative research that indicated the presence of internalised homophobia in gay study participants8080 and he described that: ‘its existence had a profound impact on my awareness of just how deeply gay men’s development can be affected by the negative messages which have been internalised during maturation’.71  The experiences of health professionals administering treatments77 can be compared to the research by Smith et al.73 investigating the effects of treatments for homosexuality on patients involved. It showed that the strong culture of homophobia at that time appeared to have had a large impact on some of the patients interviewed: “I felt totally bewildered that my entire emotional life was being written  61LGBT health up in the papers as utter filth and perversity” (male).73 Smith et al. reported that, where people sought to confide, they were ‘usually met with silence, condemnation and rejection or told their homosexual feelings constituted a temporary phase’ and that they felt ‘shame and isolation’.73 In some participants, an inner struggle was apparent: “Mainly that from a guilt-ridden Christian point of view it meant that at least I had tried to do something and it had proved not to work” (male).73 The internal conflict of Christian views and homosexual feelings was evident and may have contributed to internalised feelings of low self-worth and a negative view of homosexuality.   In other studies, where participants had not undergone treatments for homosexuality, guilt still appeared to play an important role. A respondent in a study of gay man, after attending a sexual health clinic, reported: “I’ve got enough guilt on my plate without them laying it on” and others in this study referred to themselves as a “Slut” or ‘made self-disparaging remarks’67. Distaste for homosexuality, from a sense of guilt or otherwise, may have resulted in internal conflict and this was evident in another study investigating gay men’s experiences of counselling: “I personally don’t have a problem with being gay, but when I think about it, maybe subconsciously I have got a problem with it” (James).71  In one study, there was also the suggestion that internal homophobia took the form of a rejection of gay culture. In a study of gay men’s experiences of counselling, one participant commented that: “I wouldn’t choose to say that I was a gay male. My impression of gay males is that they all go round in women’s clothing and make lots of noise and wear pink T-shirts. A sort of in-your-face, sort of terribly camp, effeminate male” (Ed)71 whilst other gay respondents appeared even more assertive in their distaste: “I find it very hard to take gay people [counselling] seriously” (Tom),71 “No way! I have a real mistrust of them” (Nigel).71 These reservations were based on previous experiences of gay men in other settings. Men in this study, despite displaying what appeared to be negative attitudes towards other gay men, were simultaneously ‘monitoring their own therapists for any signs of homophobia’.71 This apparent contradiction may have displayed some internal conflict, with feelings of homophobia against their own sexuality.    62LGBT health In young people, who may be considered to have grown up in a more ‘gay-friendly’ environment, there was still suggestion of the presence of internalised homophobia. In a study of LGBT young people, some showed almost contradictory views of themselves and their sexuality, speaking about being ‘out and proud’ but also ‘simultaneously feeling uncomfortable with their sexual identity or despising aspects of gay culture’.74 This internal conflict may have had a destructive power, one respondent in this study commenting that it made him “feel really horrible” and another ‘rejected the identity lesbian’.74 In this study one respondent reported how a friend’s internal struggle had led to destructive behaviour: “I know Matt has self-harmed because he gets so upset about the way he is…he can’t get rid of it, no matter how hard he tries” (Cherie, aged 17).74  The desire of the young person to “get rid of it” portrays a picture of unhappiness with him or herself. An attempt to dispel homosexual feelings may relate to a desire to conform to the culturally acceptable heterosexual orientation. The high rates of self-harm in homosexual people (see quantitative review) may, in part, be related to feelings of homophobia within the individual. Although young people in this study were generally not ashamed of their homosexuality, they appeared to have had difficulty in gaining self-acceptance on every level. The authors may have summarised the root of this problem well in their comment that, ‘developing a positive LGB or T identity requires them to construct themselves against the overwhelming pressure of the heterosexual norm’.74   Heterosexism More subtle than overt homophobia, heterosexism may be a common means of undermining the value of homosexuality and may mediate inadequacies in healthcare. The term heterosexism describes the assumption that opposite sex orientation is the norm and implies that same-sex relationships have an inferior status. This prevailing attitude manifests itself at many levels in society: in public services, schooling, healthcare etc, with the general assumption that people are heterosexual.  In a local survey of young LGBT people in Sandwell, participants highlighted experiences of heterosexism in the healthcare system: “When I went to see my  63LGBT health GP…... He just assumed my sexuality without asking. I ended up having to tell him I was a lesbian. Once someone has made that assumption, it’s much harder to come out.” and “They all assume you’re ‘straight’ so, for an easy life, I just go along with it” (Making visible the invisible).26  Heterosexism also appears to be encountered more widely in the UK health system. In a study of lesbian and gay patients, participants criticised GPs and practice staff for assuming heterosexuality.68 In another study of gay and bisexual men, difficulties were experienced when their doctors assumed that they were heterosexual.66 One informant described how, when he was seeking advice for stress, his doctor said “Oh, you’re a man…you’ll get over this girl” (informant 7).66 Another man who was attending a consultation with his partner was asked “Well, who are you anyway?” (Informant 13).66 In the first example, the assumption that the respondent was worried about a “girl” and, in the second example, that the partner had no connection with the patient, showed an approach of heterosexism, also reported in other studies. For example, in a study of experiences of lesbian and gay people, one female respondent recounted a conversation where, when undergoing a cervical smear test, she was asked: “are you having sex? – yes – are you worried about getting pregnant? – no – why not? – my partners a woman – oh [with reported shock]” (Female informant).68  In these studies there was evidence of heterosexism in the attitudes of some medical staff although some may try to avoid these assumptions. In one study a doctor described how he strived to put questions across in a way that did not assume heterosexuality: “‘Do you have a partner?’ Or ‘Who do you live with?’…I try and ask those sort of neutral questions” (GP, Male, age 39).76 Although this may not be the norm, using open questions, that do not assume that people are heterosexual, may be an important step in negating barriers to communication.   Lack of professional approach  A distinction may be made between personal opinion and practice. Some healthcare workers may maintain homophobic views or practice heterosexism whatever the training given or prevailing climate of opinion. In these cases, professionalism is likely to be vital for a non-biased approach. For example, a doctor in the study by  64LGBT health Hinchliff et al. who showed negative views about the sexual practices of gay and lesbian patients, also talked about adapting his approach to communicate with patients: “at the same time encourage the patient to talk about these issues by appearing to be quite facilitatory and welcoming of their views. That takes time to learn” (GP, Male, age 42).76 The GP spoke of “appearing” to be accepting of these patients despite his underlying feelings. Although not ideal, a recognition of homophobic feelings and an attempt to facilitate communication may be the most positive approach for some doctors and may lead to adequate patient care.  In other cases, homophobia was not masked and led to inappropriate behaviour and a lack of professionalism. This often appeared to be based on religious grounds. In a study of gay and bisexual men, one man described how he’d been “offered evangelical religious counselling to ‘cure’ him of his homosexuality”66 and, in another study an older gay man described how ‘a doctor reacted to his being gay by verbally insulting him and (despite his Jewish faith) handing him a Christian tract’.69 In another study, a lesbian seeking healthcare during pregnancy related that: “The midwife said she had never heard of people like us. She wouldn’t book me in; espoused her Christian beliefs”.72 The treatment of lesbian mothers may be a particularly controversial area and this study gave other examples of negative attitudes expressed by healthcare professionals: “She stated outright that a woman should not consider childrearing unless married to a man”, “My GP stated that he did not agree with two women bringing up children” and “[They] placed [my] child on [the] concern list! Because of the nature of our relationship, i.e. lesbians”.72 These mothers had negative experiences of health care primarily due to healthcare workers giving their own opinion in place of using a professional approach. Wilton et al. highlighted that ‘the sole service area where midwives are entitled to refuse to participate on moral or religious grounds is termination of pregnancy’.72 A lack of professionalism may lead to rudeness but, of more concern, may result in improper treatment, discrimination and breaking of the law.  Lack of knowledge  Gay and lesbian respondents identified that various aspects of knowledge were important in discussions with their GP. In relation to the use of sexual health clinics, a gay man expressed that it was important that doctors understood issues relating to  65LGBT health being gay: “You want people to get it….you’re not going to have to explain things about being a gay man”67 and an older gay respondent in another study, despite praising his general practice, commented that ‘they had a limited understanding of his sexuality, especially in relation to sex or what gay men actually do’.69 In a third study, a gay man commented about his counsellor that: “I’ve used the word ‘cottaging’ and she’s given me a strange look and I’ve had to explain that”.71 The need to explain sexual practices or social environments may act not only as a barrier in communication, but to further feelings of alienation and isolation from the assumed norms of heterosexual society.   Concern about lack of knowledge was also apparent in healthcare professionals expressing feelings of doubt for their own ability to understand homosexual practices and terminology. In a study of GPs, one respondent commented: “I suppose gay men and women I wouldn’t mention it [sexual health] unless they brought it up because perhaps thinking that they might feel that I don’t understand the mechanics of it all or something like that” (female, age 42).76 Other GPs in this study also felt that their lack of knowledge acted as a barrier to asking about sexual matters and that that they did not know much of the terminology used.76   A lack of knowledge however may not necessarily act as a barrier where an interested, polite approach is taken. In a study of lesbian mothers72 comments were made that: “They were intrigued, curious into my choices for being pregnant and using donor insemination, but this was dealt with in a sensitive, caring manner” and “People are curious and I don’t mind being open – I hope it may broaden their experience and attitude” and “They wanted to learn about lesbian parenting”.72 In another study,66 gay and bisexual men had ‘little expectation that their GPs should be experts in matters relating to sexuality’ but said that they should ‘approach their patients with an open mind, listen to them and engage with their experience’: “they’ve just got to keep their wits about them and be able to talk intelligently” (Gay man).66 A lack of knowledge of terminology or sexual practices may not always limit effective treatment or inhibit good patient-professional relationships where sensitivity and openness are used.    66LGBT health Misunderstandings Misunderstandings between patient and healthcare worker may inhibit forming positive relationships. In the current review, factors that appeared to be sources of misunderstanding were: preconceptions of homophobia by LGB patients, differences in terminology used and the embarrassment of health professionals.   LGB people may bring with them preconceptions about the attitudes of physicians. Some patients showed fear of direct homophobia. In a local study of Birmingham’s LGB community, one participant said that they were: “Fearful of being open about my sexuality with my GP for fear of labelling, being treated differently” (Male aged 25-34y) (A matter of trust). In a study of gay men undergoing counselling, one participant said: “I mean, straight men are normally homophobic”.71 In a study of lesbian mothers, of those that did not disclose their sexuality to midwives, the majority wanted to but did not for fear of homophobia.72 One participant said: “I had been told that health visitors could make things very difficult if they were prejudiced”.72 In a study of older gay men, it was noted that ‘Anticipation or fear of differing treatment was more common than actual experiences of discrimination’69 and another informant in a different study commented that: “I’d be worried about any kind of prejudice”.66 Even before any attempted discourse, some lesbian and gay patients may have expected to encounter homophobia from their GPs. A gay male participant in another study, describing his reasons for not being able to talk with GPs about homosexual issues, gave a comment that may summarise well the view of many LGB individuals: “A doctor’s a doctor, init”.67 A pre-conceived notion that doctors will not understand or approve of homosexuality may reduce openness, lead to misunderstandings and act as a barrier to good communication.  Another factor that may lead to misunderstandings between patient and doctor may be in the use of terms to describe homosexuality. In a study of gay men,71 differing views were expressed about the term they would choose to describe their sexuality. One stated that: “I would actually describe myself as a homosexual male. I wouldn’t choose to say that I was a gay male”71 whilst, for other respondents, the opposite preference was apparent: “….and I kept using the word ‘gay’ and they kept using the word ‘homosexual’ and I think it was that that distanced me”, “I don’t like the word ‘homosexual’ because I think it throws out a criminal reference”.71 These differing  67LGBT health preferences, held by different individuals, may have made communication difficult. It may be important that doctors are perceptive to the words that each patient uses and that they refer to terms that the patient has chosen to describe their sexuality.   A final source of misunderstandings may be related to the interpretation of apparent embarrassment or discomfort in healthcare professionals. One of the negative qualities of GPs/medical staff identified by participants in one study68 was that they were “uncomfortable”. This was listed by investigators with other, clearly homophobic reactions, such as being “judgemental” or “rude”. Although this characteristic may result from homophobia, it is also worth considering that apparent discomfort may also relate to a lack of knowledge or not knowing the appropriate way to act (see ‘Lack of knowledge’ above) or to embarrassment. Embarrassment on the part of healthcare workers may lead to misunderstanding about the views of the professional and may act as a barrier to effective communication. One lesbian woman describing maternity care related that: “Our sexual preference was acknowledged but not discussed. We perceived embarrassment on their behalf”72 and a young person participating in a local survey commented: “Sometimes when they say it’s best not to mention it, I know it’s not for my comfort it’s for theirs”.26   A study of the views of general practitioners also suggested the same difficulty: ‘doctors reported feelings of shyness, being uncomfortable and not wanting to be intrusive’.76 One gay man in another study felt that his counsellor was not comfortable with his sexuality: “I have a feeling that she is somewhat homophobic really. She might encourage me to talk (about gay issues) but her face is saying, ‘Oh my God!’”71 This client perceived, rightly or wrongly, that his counsellor was homophobic despite her efforts to engage and talk about his sexuality. Embarrassment in discussing issues relating to homosexual behaviour may play a role in relationship break-down since, what may be embarrassment, appears as homophobia and inhibits patient-counsellor interaction.   Being over cautious A possible consequence of embarrassment in discussions of sexual health may be that both healthcare workers and LGB patients are over-cautious when relating to each other. In Hinchliff’s study of GPs (no particular sexual orientation), one female  68LGBT health doctor commented “maybe I tread too carefully” (GP, female, age 43) and another related that “I don’t think we are very good at it yet….just phrase questions so that people can be open about their sexuality without it having to be a big deal” (female, age 50).76 The frustration that some patients may have felt with an over-cautious approach by GPs was articulated by one lesbian mother in another study: “Using the word LESBIAN! (its not catching)”.72   Alternatively, in a study of lesbian mothers, humour was identified as a good way to achieve a relaxed atmosphere and an example given was a comment by a woman’s health visitor: “Oh, it’s just like that programme on the telly!”.72 Where healthcare professionals have the confidence to make more humorous conversation, this may lighten the atmosphere and facilitate good patient-professional communication. An assertive approach by patients may also be beneficial to effective communication. In Cant’s study of gay men, participants who were assertive and open with their GPs experienced good communication.67 In this study one participant identified the importance of a bold approach by both doctors and patients: “They ask you straight out which I think is good…but you’ve got to be truthful because to get anything back you have to give them to information”.67  An extremely direct approach may not be appropriate in all cases since individuals are different and the assumption that all LGB people will appreciate directness may be over-simplified. The ideal approach is likely to depend on many factors: the patient’s personality, health needs, personal situation and past experiences. Health care workers may need to be perceptive to the particular needs of each patient in order to communicate in the most appropriate and effective way.   Importance of affirmation  An environment that does not condemn homophobic discrimination may lead to an atmosphere of uncertainty for homosexual individuals, unsure of how their sexuality will be accepted. Negative past experiences and the expectation of homophobia may create a difficult premise on which to base a relationship of trust.  In a study of lesbian mothers, statements of affirmation by health professionals were highlighted by many women as being important.72 When gay and lesbian participants reported good experiences of counselling in another study, positive statements were  69LGBT health made about counsellors being “really empathetic” and that they felt “very supported” and “cared for, I felt like I mattered”.70 Another participant in this study commented that: “it was useful she wasn’t gay and so accepting because she showed me that all straight people don’t say nasty things”.70 Other respondents reported feeling a sense of “equality” and being “treated as a human being”.70 In another study, an older gay man described how he felt that ‘empathy’ was the most important quality in a counsellor.69 Of a counsellor who he had found kind and respectful he said: “He seemed to realise much more how I felt and he was very concerned and he obviously seemed to think I was a nice person”.69 The interest and kindness that this counsellor showed was important in this case and positive experiences, reported in these studies, generally appear to be based on feelings of affirmation and mutual respect. Where past negative experiences may have undermined self-confidence and trust, these experiences affirm the clients feeling of self worth and value as an individual.   In the studies currently reviewed, there was also an indication that, not only did homosexual patients expect to be questioned about their sexuality, but that ongoing dialogue helped to affirm that the doctor had a positive attitude. In relation to counselling, one gay man described how: “The initial statement ‘Gay is fine’ was there, but there was no on-going affirmation”.71   The need for more than a ‘gay is fine’ approach may be consistent with the feelings of other LGB people. Other gay men in this study also seemed to be looking for a non-passive approach and counsellor feedback: “I could be talking to that telly and get more response” and “You know, sometimes I don’t feel he challenges enough”.71 These men stated that they wanted a “response” or “challenge” but the need for some ongoing dialogue about their sexuality may have suggested a desire for affirmation that they were respected and approved of as homosexual people. In the healthcare setting, although medical staff may not see their role to primarily be one of patient affirmation, this may be an important contribution to the emotional wellbeing of patients and may build patient trust and good communication.   70LGBT health Institutional barriers In the current review of qualitative studies, other barriers to healthcare were associated with institutional level problems (indication given of whether perspectives are largely from patients or healthcare professionals): - Lack of appropriate protocols (patients) - Lack of appropriate referrals (patients) - Poor confidentiality (patients) - Discontinuity of care (patients) - Lack of gay-friendly resources (patients) - The need for training (professionals)   71LGBT health Lack of appropriate protocols  Medical staff may find it difficult to act in a sensitive way if they are required to follow standard protocols that assume heterosexuality. In a study of lesbian and gay men, investigators described how, ‘there was no structured opportunity for gay men to come out if they wished’ and that ‘The design of the information systems and the categories offered for recording information were not inclusive of non-heterosexual identities’.68 The use of protocols tailored to heterosexual people may result in inappropriate questioning. For example, in a local survey of young LGBT people’s experiences, one participant described how: “During my hospital stay, the nurses asked a lot of questions that I thought were irrelevant, when I told them I was gay”.26 The built-in provision of an opportunity for openness about sexual orientation in the protocol for medical consultations may also be important. One woman participating in a study examining the experiences of lesbian mothers commented that: “Questions at initial contact should give the gentle opportunity to come out”.72  For women, especially in relation to pregnancy and childbirth, the requirement to come out may be much more likely. This study of lesbian mothers suggested that these issues were not always dealt with using tact and sensitivity.72 Women appeared to have had very different experiences in the extent to which they were questioned. Some of the midwives ‘did not ask questions where they could usefully have done so’ and the majority of patients were not asked about whether they wanted their information to be kept confidential.72 Some questions were seen as inappropriate: “My midwife asked me questions…that I didn’t really want to answer”, “I felt pressurised to give his [the fathers] name” and “I do not feel the question of how I got pregnant is of any relevance to health professionals”.72 The inadequacy of the forms used for initial registration was also highlighted: “When we went to the initial booking-in interview they very patiently amended the form, changing reference to ‘father’ to either ‘donor’ or ‘partner’ depending on the circumstances, apologising for the inadequacies of the form”.72 The experiences of these women suggested that appropriate, repeatable protocols for registration and treatment of lesbian mothers were not in place. A systematic, transparent approach, using a set protocol that is applicable to women of all sexualities, is desirable to avoid inappropriate questions, reduce misunderstandings and improve patient confidentiality.   72LGBT health Lack of appropriate referrals  The current studies suggested a lack of appropriate referrals to social support groups and sexual health clinics for LGBT people. In a study of gay men, none reported having been referred by their GPs to sexual health clinics or voluntary organisations although most had self-referred to these types of agencies.67 Similarly, in another study, many gay and lesbian patients had self-referred to counselling projects but ‘there was no evidence to suggest that any GP had referred them to such projects’ and there was also no evidence of referral for counselling of victims of hate crime.68 An older gay man in another study was not referred for bereavement support and, only after expressing suicidal intentions to his GP, was he offered counselling.69  Voluntary organisations were seen as an important source of support and emotional and social well-being. In a study of gay men one commented that: “The group has achieved lots for me personally – cos I thought that I was in a situation that no-one else can understand but there’s so many other people in that situation in life”67 and, in another study, a number of women identified that they would have appreciated being linked up with other lesbian mothers or referred to local support groups.72 The importance of support groups is evident from attitudes expressed. Lack of knowledge, thought or the absence of a desire to help may be the cause of the poor rate of appropriate GP referrals. However, this may be an important area where large benefits for patients may be achieved.   Poor confidentiality Participants in some studies had concerns about confidentially in relation to their sexual orientation. Of lesbian women choosing not to disclose their sexuality to midwives, many were worried that information would not be kept confidential.72 This issue was highlighted by a number of informants in another study, where several men were concerned that information about their sexuality might not be kept confidential and might impact applications for mortgages, insurance etc.68 One man thought that, following disclosure of his sexuality by a doctor, his insurance company had significantly increased his insurance premium, linked to a risk of contracting HIV.68 In another study of gay men, one respondent said: “I was informed that it was harder to get mortgages and insurance policies and all that sort of thing once you  73LGBT health disclose you’re gay”67 and this was also a particular area of concern for gay and bisexual men in another study, who were afraid that information might be passed on to other agencies.66   The other area of fear related to confidentiality highlighted by study investigators was that information would be shared with other members of staff and might quickly travel outside into the local community, having damaging effects.66 This fear may to some extent have been justified. For example, experiences of women in other studies were having ‘lesbian mother’ written across their child’s health record in an unrelated consultation68 and another woman ‘was distressed to find that her sexuality had been discussed on the maternity ward without her knowledge’.72 Where appropriate rules for confidentiality in relation to sexuality are not in place, there may be a risk of inappropriate use of patient details.   Discontinuity of care An area identified as important in one particular study was the extent to which patients felt there was continuity of care.72 This study examined the maternity experiences of lesbian mothers and, when talking about positive and negative experiences, many identified continuity of care as important: “Particularly helpful - a midwife who knew us and with whom we had developed a relationship, who was able to be there for most of the labour”, “I had lots of different midwives – one I saw twice and she remembered”, “midwives changed with every appointment and often I just let the ‘father’ and ‘husband’ comments go as I knew I would not be seeing them again so there was no point in putting myself through an embarrassing situation”, “I really wish I could have had continuity of care, the same midwife throughout…This would have spared me so much anxiety”.72  Continuity of care may be desirable for all those experiencing healthcare but may be particularly important for LGB people, especially in the case of lesbian women during pregnancy and childbirth. Continuity of care limits the number of times a person is required to ‘come out’ and promotes the formation of a trusting relationship between the patient and healthcare worker.   74LGBT health Lack of gay-friendly resources  A lack of overtly LGB resources in waiting rooms was identified as a problem by participants in many of the studies currently reviewed. In a study of gay men, participants felt that information leaflets in GP waiting rooms were not gay-friendly67 and, in another study of gay and bisexual men, no participants reported seeing any materials that promoted or featured gay or bisexual men.66 Lesbian mothers identified the need for literature to represent both hetero and homosexual parenting: “It would have been helpful if literature and other spoken information gave examples from lesbian or gay families…so that it was clear from the outset that there was not prejudice against us”.72 This female respondent makes an important point. The provision of literature that is relevant to homosexuals not only provides information but acts to normalise homosexuality. The presence of this written material may act threefold: to inform, to act as assurance to homosexual individuals that they will not be judged and to educate both medical staff and other patients in acceptance of homosexuality and rejection of a culture of heterosexism.  The feeling that overtly gay/lesbian literature would act to reassure LGB people was held by participants in other studies. An older gay man commented on his desire to see gay literature in his GP waiting area: “so if there was a gay one then I would know the practice is likely to be gay friendly”.69 In a study of gay and bisexual men one man suggested: “Why not have some stuff that’s obviously gay…if you see something like that it does give you a lot of confidence”.66 A major function of this type of literature may therefore be to act as an assurance that practices will be ‘gay-friendly’. As suggested by a GP participant in the study by Hinchliff et al.,76 this might also be achieved by presenting a clear non-discriminatory policy so that “people have it in black and white that they shouldn’t be discriminated against” (male, aged 42).   75LGBT health The need for training In a study of the views and experiences of general practitioners,76 many spoke of the need for better training for GPs. Doctors generally felt that training related to understanding sexual practices of lesbian and gay people was more important than gaining knowledge about physiological elements of homosexual sexual health.76 This appeared to relate back to the feelings of inadequate knowledge, expressed by GPs in the same study. Training may have helped to break down barriers in communication related to knowledge of sexual-practice. Participants commented that they had not had training on homosexuality and sexual health in medical school and it was suggested that ‘vocational training’ would have been useful.76 One doctor related how, in his medical training, there was no “specific training on psychosexual medicine”, how the limited training that may be given to new doctors is “a really positive experience” and that it was “something we should do a lot more of” (male, age 40).76 Another said “I would encourage young doctors to participate in workshops on helping people with their sexual health. I found it was very useful myself in the past” (female, age 48).76  Although formal training may have an important function, there is some suggestion that the important skills may need to be developed over time. One GP who said: “I think it’s something we need to be trained in and we need to be more aware of”, identified training as a way of doctors being “comfortable” with gay and lesbian patients and the need to ‘dispel any feelings of discomfort’ was also identified by others in this study.76 This type of learning may not be rapidly acquired. For example, in the same study of GPs, ‘Two participants described how, through direct experience of lesbians and gay men consulting about their sexual health, they had progressively overcome the difficulties which they faced’76 and another commented that “You almost have to practice feeling comfortable and familiar” (female, age 43). The progression to feeling comfortable and the “practice” required suggested that the learning process may require time. The investigators in this study highlighted the importance of ‘experimental learning’, identified by doctors as a positive way to get used to discussing sexual health issues with gay and lesbian patients.76 Real interaction with LGBT patients, rather than theoretical teaching, may also be important for the development of good doctor-patient communication.  76LGBT health The following table summarises evidence from the qualitative literature into factors for consideration by health professionals and health commissioners.

FACTORS RELEVANT TO NHS  The main factors of relevance to the NHS are the recent changes in legislation and the requirement to produce Equality Impact Assessments.  4.1 Legislation changes 4.1.1 Repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act (1998) Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 amended Section 2 of the Local Government Act 1986 by inserting Section 2A, which stated that a local authority:  \"shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality\" or \"promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\" 81 The effect of it was that schoolteachers and many local authority officers were unsure about what they could and could not say and do, and whether they could help pupils dealing with homophobic bullying and abuse. As a result, much homophobic bullying went unchallenged, which had important consequences for mental health. Also, local authorities were unclear as to what legitimate services they could provide for lesbian, gay and bisexual members of their communities.82,83   Section 28 of the Local Government Act was repealed in England in 2003. Since then there have been a number of changes with regards to education and LGBT issues. There is now reference in a number of government education policy documents (DfES, OFSTED and GTCE policy documents) explicitly challenging homophobia and including sexual orientation within the spectrum of equality and diversity issues to be addressed by schools.84   4.1.2 Equality Act 2006 and other recent legislation Recent legislation in England has resulted in a duty of care on a range of bodies, including public sector bodies, on issues of sexuality and gender. The cumulative effect of this legislation with regard to the NHS, (some of which was undertaken by Act of Parliament and some of which by Regulations laid before Parliament), was to render discrimination against LGBT people in employment, training and provision of goods and services unlawful. This also applies to independent sector providers.  78LGBT health  • The Equalities Act 2006 set up the Equality and Human Rights Commission which included the requirement to take action on discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation as one of the six original equalities strands.1 Transgender was subsequently added as the seventh strand. • The Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003 made it unlawful to discriminate against anyone in employment or training on the grounds of their sexual orientation.85 • The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 (2007 No. 1263) made discrimination against someone in the provision of goods and services on grounds of sexual orientation an unlawful act by any agency including most public bodies and the NHS.86 • The Sex Discrimination Act (1975) was amended by the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 no 110287 to make it clear that transsexual men and women are expressly included in the Sex Discrimination Act where they suffer discrimination because they have undergone, or are about to undergo gender reassignment. • The Gender Recognition Act (2004) prohibits disclosure of the background of a trans person with a Gender Recognition Certificate88 and health staff may be reported to the police and prosecuted under section 22 of the Gender Recognition Act for disclosure without consent. • The Sex Discrimination (Amendment of Legislation) Regulations 2008 (2008 No 963) amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1975  to render unlawful discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment in all but very tightly defined circumstances.89 • The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (chapter 4) provides legal protection against incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation and covers serious acts of hatred (murder, assault etc).90  At the time of writing a new Equality Bill was announced in the Queen's Speech (8th Dec 2008) which will extend the existing duty on public bodies to consider how their spending decisions, employment practices, and service delivery can affect people according to their race, disability, or gender and will include sexual orientation,  79LGBT health gender reassignment, age, and religion or belief. It will do this by creation of a single equality duty.  These recent legislative changes have changed the legal climate in which LGBT people live in the UK. It is currently unclear as to the impact this will have on LGBT health.  4.2 Equality schemes The Department of Health in 2007 introduced guidance requiring NHS bodies to have a single equality scheme covering all legal strands of diversity.91 This includes sexual orientation and gender identity. The Department intended that this guidance would help NHS Bodies enact the existing and new duties of equality introduced by legislation. Equality Impact assessments are a way of examining the main functions and policies of an organisation to see whether they have the potential to affect people differently. There is a general duty for NHS employers to undertake these assessments as a requirement of race, gender and disability equality legislation, but they should also cover all the strands of diversity and ensure that all receive equitable attention.   More recently the NHS Constitution’s first value92 states that:  “ the NHS provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of gender, race, disability, age, religion or belief. It has a duty to each and every individual that it serves and must respect their human rights. At the same time, it has a wider social duty to promote equality through the services it provides and to pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population.” The Health Bill 2009, currently before Parliament, intends to place a duty on providers and commissioners of NHS services to take account of the Constitution in their provision and commissioning of services.  4.2.1 Equity issues  There is no evidence-based assessment of impact on LGBT health inequalities by ethnic group or socio-economic category due to lack of information.   80LGBT health 5. DISCUSSION  5.1 Summary of results Remarkably few peer reviewed and published studies were found on LGBT health excluding HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and transitioning. Given that there are millions of medical journal articles listed in the databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE, and many of these refer to UK research, 27 articles seemed rather a low number. This compares to much more UK research literature available on a wide variety of Black and ethnic minority health issues. For example, systematic reviews are available on child mental health differences amongst ethnic groups in Britain containing 49 included studies,93 on ethnic variation in UK asthma frequency and morbidity with 13 included studies94 and on physical activity in UK South Asians with 17 included studies.95  This also mirrors findings from a general investigation into the proportion of LGBT health-related research from any country listed in MEDLINE that found only a tiny proportion (0.098%) of relevant material.96 As it estimated that LGBT people comprise 5-7% of the population, LGBT health could be seen as a neglected area of public health and much more needs to be done to understand these issues.97   It can be seen from the search strategy and inclusion criteria that trans health research was originally going to be included in this systematic review. Unfortunately, having trawled through all of the literature, no peer-reviewed and published UK-specific information was found on the general health of trans people. All trans-related publications were about the transition process only. There was only one small piece of information on seven trans people from one of the West Midlands surveys (A Matter of Trust, 2002) which is too small a sample to provide any meaningful results generalisable to the trans population as a whole.  There was little information on people who identify as bisexual.    81LGBT health The main findings on physical and mental health from the review are as follows: • The research from the unpublished West Midlands surveys was broadly similar to that in published research, where a comparison could be made between the two.  • For general health, long term illnesses and prescribed medication use, there did not seem to be stark differences between the LGB samples and the general population. There is a possibility that there were higher rates of poor health but fewer with longstanding illnesses, however finding appropriate comparators was difficult due to the general nature of the questions. There appeared to be fewer taking prescribed medication but there were few people aged over 65 in the LGB samples and it is known that many more older people than younger people in the general population take prescribed medication.61 • There was no information for a large number of important and relatively common diseases including tuberculosis, eye or ear problems, blindness or deafness, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, digestive system diseases such as ulcerative colitis or irritable bowel disease, skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroid problems and prostate problems. • There was insufficient information on many common diseases to be able to determine whether there were higher rates in the LGB samples or not, including a wide variety of common cancers, diabetes, epilepsy, neurological conditions, coronary heart disease, asthma and arthritis. For example, the 2% point estimate cancer rate from one West Midlands survey is likely to be very imprecise. • There was no published UK research to demonstrate that lesbians and bisexual women were at any less risk of cervical cancer than the general female population.  • Much research on mental health was available and the results for a variety of aspects of mental health were worse in the LGB samples than comparator groups and the general population.  • The rates for depression and anxiety appear to be 2-3 times higher than in the general population, as do the rates for suicide ideology and suicide attempts.   82LGBT health • The apparent rate of eating disorders is remarkably high in LGB people, compared to the general population, particularly in men (~10% LGB vs ~2% women, 0.2% men).  • There appears to be a higher rate of polycystic ovary syndrome causing infertility in lesbians compared to heterosexual women.  • The rates of domestic violence and abuse in the LGB samples seemed to be similar to women in the general population. • There are much higher rates of self-harm in the LGB samples (~ 25% LGB vs ~2.4% general population).  The main findings on health behaviours from the review are as follows: • The research from the unpublished West Midlands surveys was broadly similar to that in published research, where a comparison could be made between the two.  • There did not appear to be higher rates of obesity in the LGB samples compared to the general population. This might be expected in gay and bisexual men because of the relatively high numbers of slim, fit-looking men attending bars and clubs, but was surprising in lesbian and bisexual women because of previous studies from abroad suggesting that obesity rates were higher in lesbians and bisexual women than in the general population.98,99 • The little information available on diet and exercise suggested that fewer LGB people do the minimum recommendation for physical activity and eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables per day.  • There was a lot of information on smoking and rates were remarkably high. There was a suggestion of a trend towards lower rates in later studies but still the rates appear to be much higher than those in the general population. The case series on smoking prevention suggested a high rate of cessation in a gay men’s group.  • There was a lot of information on alcohol intake and the rates appeared to be relatively similar to those in the general population. This was surprising, particularly as many of the LGB samples were taken in pubs and other venues selling alcohol so it would be expected that there would be a higher number of people drinking alcohol and so higher numbers drinking more than  83LGBT health the recommended amounts. There was considerable personal concern about the amount people were drinking. • There was a large amount of information available on general illegal drug use and use of specific drugs. The rates appear to be much higher in LGB people than the general population and a wide variety of drugs are being used on a regular basis.  The main findings on delivery of health care from the quantitative and qualitative reviews are as follows: • There was little published research available to compare to the results from the unpublished West Midlands surveys. • Approximately 50% of LGB people were out to their GPs. Most GP surgeries were not overtly LGB- friendly. A small proportion of GPs were still behaving negatively towards LGB people. • There was a high rate of access of mental health counselling, but it was unclear whether this was paid for by participants or was provided by the NHS. Unfortunately, a relatively high proportion had not found it beneficial.  • The research on hepatitis vaccination found that only half of gay men were receiving hepatitis B vaccination and that the success of hepatitis B vaccination was less in gay men compared to controls.  • There were relatively high rates of breast self-examination and mammography in lesbian and bisexual women and testicular self-examination in gay men but much lower rates of cervical screening in lesbian and bisexual women compared to the general female population.  • There appear to be important relational barriers between LGB patients and some healthcare professionals. These may be due to:  - Homophobia of health professionals, manifest in rudeness, aggression or malpractice.  - Assumptions by professionals of patient heterosexuality.  - Lack of healthcare professional’s knowledge of the LGB social scene and relevant vocabulary. - Misunderstandings between LGB patients and healthcare professionals. These may originate from a patients expectation of homophobia/poor treatment, from differences in terminology used by patient/healthcare  84LGBT health professional and from misinterpreted embarrassment shown by healthcare professionals.  - Healthcare professional taking an over cautious approach and not engaging well with LGB patients.  - A lack of LGB identity affirmation by healthcare professionals. • Barriers to healthcare for LGB individuals also appear to be present at the institutional level: - Standard, routinely used protocols assume heterosexuality. - Health professionals may not be referring LGB patients appropriately. - There may be a lack of LGB patient confidentiality (which may be perception or reality). - Discontinuity of care may be a particular issue for LGB individuals, requiring them to ‘come out’ on numerous occasions. - There is often an absence of LGB tailored resources in healthcare establishments. -  Health professionals identified the need for training in psycho-sexual health. 5.2 Strengths, limitations and uncertainties 5.2.1 Strengths One of the major strengths of this systematic review is that the team included an expert who has worked in LGBT health for more than 10 years. As a result, many papers and other pieces of research have been identified that would have not otherwise been available. None of the West Midlands surveys are available via standard databases so would have been impossible to find without prior knowledge. The team also included an experienced information specialist. Therefore it is highly likely that all relevant published research evidence has been included in this report. Another strength is that, between them, the team have published more than 50 systematic reviews and are very experienced in systematic review methods in a wide variety of subject areas.   Considerable care was taken when conducting this systematic review to find and include studies is a systematic way. The explicit methods in this report mean that the review should be reproducible. With regard to the review of systematic reviews within  85LGBT health this report, it is important to note that where included systematic reviews had published papers that were includable according to the inclusion criteria, they were excluded in order to prevent double counting of papers.   This systematic review has found consistency of findings across numerous different publications and publication types, particularly for mental health, eating disorders and self harm, and health behaviours, smoking, drinking and illegal drug use. There is a relatively larger amount of research, including quantitative as well as qualitative research on the delivery of healthcare. The qualitative research, identifying barriers to patients accessing healthcare, appears to be consistent with quantitative research showing low rates of ‘coming out’ to GPs and poor attendance at health screenings.   5.2.2 Limitations A major weakness in the research base was that so few of the included studies had heterosexual comparators drawn from similar populations. Considerable efforts were made to find the most appropriate comparators from routinely collected statistics from the Office for National Statistics or equivalent published studies in the general population (see Appendix 2), but the comparison with routinely collected data will only give rough estimates with which to compare because there will be so many different data characteristics such as date of data collection, age distributions, ethnicity, geographical location, income and social class. The routinely collected data was given for the date as near as possible to the data collection of the surveys but sometimes this was not available. Also, for some prevalences it was very difficult to find suitable routinely collected data, such as for cancer prevalence. Incidence data in cancer is much more widely collected but to get this information for LGBT populations would need a cohort study that asked the sexual orientation question. As the Office for National Statistics has now developed a suitable question, this is a possibility, but has not been done as yet.   The information for the West Midlands was from small surveys from non-random samples, often collected in pubs or other venues so each survey will probably not be representative of the LGBT population as a whole. Also, cross-sectional surveys such as these are low in the hierarchy of evidence so any conclusions from these  86LGBT health studies should be viewed with caution. On the other hand, putting the results of these studies together should improve the representativeness of the results found.   The lack of information about a wide variety of illnesses could be seen as a limitation of the systematic review. However, it is important to know what information is not available, in order to plan future research more appropriately. This is particularly true where no information was available, such as for trans health.   There were numerous surveys and other research that could not be included in this systematic review, either because they were not from the West Midlands or were not fully published. It is a limitation in that information from these surveys could not be used, particularly the bisexual and trans research, as the impression given in the systematic review is that there is no research available, whereas there is some but it was not included as it did not meet the inclusion criteria. If all the unpublished research had been included, the systematic review would have been unmanageably large.   5.2.3 Uncertainties It is uncertain whether the differences in health found between LGBT populations and the general population or of heterosexuals could be due to differences in income or social class. However, this information was collected where available and comparison with routinely collected data suggests that the LGBT population distribution of the samples surveyed may be of higher social class than the general population but possibly slightly lower with regards to income (see Table 52).   Anecdotally, it has been noticed within the older lesbian community that there appear to be relatively high rates of auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and thyroiditis. There was no information available to support or refute this possibility.   There was no fully published information found on the rates of breast cancer in lesbians and bisexual women from anywhere in the world. The Prescription for Change survey, West Midlands subset did not give breast cancer prevalence rates but the full survey did and it found that 8.3% aged 50-79 had been diagnosed with  87LGBT health breast cancer. In the report, they quoted that 1 in 20 (5%) of women in the general population have breast cancer but they don’t reference this statement. It is known that the prevalence of breast cancer in women aged 45-64 is approximately 2.2%.100 If the rate of 8.3% is correct, it is high. Research from the USA suggests that there is a higher rate of breast cancer risk in lesbians compared to their heterosexual sisters101 but no comparative studies of breast cancer incidence in lesbians and bisexual women compared to heterosexual women were identified.   The rates found for suicide ideation and suicide attempts were 2-3 times higher than those in the general public. Unfortunately it is uncertain whether the rate of successful suicide is higher in the LGBT people than the general population because no research appears to have been done in this area and sexual orientation is not collected on death certificates. Following the insertion of sexual orientation into the National Suicide Prevention Strategy it is hoped that any increased rates of successful suicides in LGBT people will decrease but, without monitoring, this will not be known. Also, it would be some years before any rate changes are known because of the current lack of a suitable baseline with which to compare.   If 0.2% of the population of men in England (~25 million) have an eating disorder this would equal ~ 50,000 men. If 5% of the population of men in England are gay or bisexual this would be ~ 1,250,000 men and if 10% of those have an eating disorder then that would suggest there are 125,000 gay and bisexual men with an eating disorder, i.e. many more than 50,000 men. Either the rates found in the LGB samples are too high, or many gay and bisexual men are not coming forward for treatment so have not been included in eating disorder prevalence statistics in the general population. It is unclear whether any UK eating disorder treatment clinics have ever systematically asked their clients, particularly the men, whether they were LGB and/or whether they had any difficulties around their sexual identity.  Similarly, if 2.4% of the general population of England (~50 million) self-harm that would be ~1,200,000 people and if ~25% LGB people self-harm, that would be 750,000 LGB people self-harming, suggesting that more than half of all people self-harming are LGB. It is unclear whether any UK self-harm treatment clinics have ever systematically asked their clients whether they were LGB and/or whether they had  88LGBT health any difficulties around their sexual identity. However, a local self-harm support group has approximately 50% LGBT participants (Personal communication, Karen Thorne, Wolverhampton PCT Self-harm Network, December 2008). The results suggest that action directed at reducing self harm in the LGB population specifically would have a disproportionate effect on reducing the overall statistic.  It is uncertain whether the opinion suggesting that there are higher rates of obesity in UK LGBT people was ever evidence-based.102 There is a possibility that this has come from research in other countries such as the USA103 but it appears not to be generalisable to the UK, given the limited evidence available at the moment.   With regard to mental health counselling, a very high proportion had sought some help but apparently a relatively large proportion had not found it beneficial. It was unclear why this was the case but it might have been because many counselling services are not experienced in LGB issues.71 In the LGB community, gay affirmative therapy has been developed104 and a number of LGB-friendly counselling services are now available to fill the gap in demand, particularly in London. No evaluation of these services compared to standard NHS services for LGB people were available.   It is unclear why GPs have refused cervical smears in lesbians31 given that there is no published information to suggest lower cervical cancer rates in lesbians compared to the general female population. It is also known that a relatively large proportion of lesbians have had sex with a man, particularly when they were young. For example, in one of the included primary quantitative studies, of the WSW, 42.9% reported heterosexual intercourse before age 16, whereas for WSM, only 21.2% reported heterosexual intercourse before age 16.7 Given that many lesbians find cervical smears uncomfortable, anything that the NHS services do to put lesbians off attending for cervical smears will exacerbate the low uptake rates. It is currently uncertain how best to encourage lesbians who need cervical smears to have them.   It was found from the West Midlands surveys that, up to 2005, only approximately 50% of gay men had received hepatitis B vaccination, but the government target listed gay men as one of the at risk categories to be vaccinated.105 However, as described in section 2.1.1 of this systematic review, MSM and gay men are not the  89LGBT health same population and, if some gay men are not sexually active, then they will not be at risk. The current government target only includes homosexual and bisexual men who attend GUM clinics. It is currently unclear whether the at-risk MSM population are receiving the vaccination they need.106   There was a general impression from the research that health service workers tend to presume LGB people to be heterosexual until told otherwise, rather than not making presumptions about people. It is clear from unpublished research that this is having a detrimental effect on some LGB people’s experience of healthcare provision.31 It is unclear how this heteronormative environment is actually affecting LGB health.   90LGBT health 6. CONCLUSIONS  Nine West Midlands surveys, two systematic reviews, 11 quantitative and 14 qualitative peer-reviewed and published studies only were included in this systematic review. They demonstrated that there is only patchy knowledge about the physical and mental health outcomes, use of health services and experience of healthcare in the UK LGBT community and many important health questions are unanswered at the moment. What is obvious is that there is a large amount of cross-sectional survey data in LGBT populations but much of it in specific areas. Therefore, there do not need to be more small LGBT surveys on the same aspects of LGBT mental health, health behaviours and experiences of healthcare as have already been investigated. Further research is needed but must use more sophisticated designs with comparison groups. There are currently huge gaps in knowledge about numerous important areas of health and some of these could be addressed by including a sexual orientation question within large population cohort studies. There is very little comparative data of LGBT populations compared to heterosexuals, and this is in the form of relatively small case-control studies. Some of these studies look at single issues only such as hepatitis vaccination in men and infertility in women. There is no longitudinal data available to be able to determine incidence of various common illnesses. No RCTs in LGBT people were found.  6.1 Recommendations for further research  Research is needed into the general health of trans people and bisexuals. For the physical health of LGBT people, further research is particularly important in a variety of areas including breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. At the moment, it is unclear whether the higher prevalence of breast cancer in lesbians and bisexual women is due to higher incidence rates (i.e. more lesbians getting breast cancer than heterosexual women) or whether it is due to a survival effect (i.e. same numbers of lesbians getting breast cancer as heterosexual women but more are surviving longer, due to unknown factors). It has been presumed that lesbians and bisexual women are at lower risk of cervical cancer than the general population and cervical screening rates are only ~50%, yet there was no information on cervical cancer rates and the fact that a higher proportion of lesbians and bisexual women had heterosexual sex before the age of 16 (43% v 21%) suggests that some  91LGBT health lesbians and bisexual women might be at higher rather than lower risk. With regards to cardiovascular disease, it is clear from the research found that there are high rates of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, particularly smoking. However, research has not taken the next step to determine whether this is actually manifests in higher rates of cardiovascular disease.   Given that there have been apparently high rates of smoking in the LGBT population for years and that a case series of smoking cessation was published in 2004, it seems remarkable that an RCT of smoking cessation in gay men or LGBT populations has apparently not been done. It would be very useful to know whether smoking cessation for LGBT people was more successful in specialist LGBT smoking cessation groups or in general (but gay-friendly) smoking cessation groups. Similarly, as there is such a high rate of mental health problems in the LGB community, it would be possible and appropriate to run an RCT of gay-specific mental health counselling versus attendance at a general NHS counselling service. It could be that applications have been made for funding but these have not been successful as yet. It is known in the LGBT research community that grant applications for LGBT health research are usually unsuccessful (see Appendix 7).   With regards to a variety of aspects of mental health, the research found suggests that the mental health of LGB people is worse than the general population but there is no information as to why and what can be done about it.   The systematic review has generated numerous specific research questions which need to be addressed. These have been categorised for ease of accessibility but several of the research areas have links with more than one category. It is acknowledged that some questions will be harder to address than others, but all would yield information that could be used to improve the health of the LGBT population: Physical health-related • What is the general physical health of trans people? This would be useful to know both before and after transition for trans people who chose this option. • What is the general physical health of bisexual people?   92LGBT health • What is the incidence of lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer etc in LGBT populations?  • Why is there a higher rate of polycystic ovary syndrome causing infertility in lesbians compared to heterosexual women? • Why is the proportion of successful hepatitis B vaccination so much lower in gay men compared to controls? Mental health related • What is the general mental health of trans people? This would be useful to know both before and after transition for trans people who chose this option. • What is the general mental health of bisexual people? • What is the rate of successful suicide in LGB people (as opposed to attempted suicide)? • What is the rate of attempted and successful suicide in trans people? • What is the proportion of LGBT people suffering from eating disorders? • Why is the rate of self-harming in LGB people apparently so high? What is the most effective way of helping them?  • What can be done about the prevention and treatment of the high rates of illegal drug use by LGB people?  Service delivery • What is the proportion of LGBT people attending eating disorder clinics? • What is the proportion of LGB people to heterosexual people attending self-harm treatment? • Is lack of exercise in LGBT people exacerbated by difficulty with accessing sports and other exercise facilities? • What is the effectiveness of a specialist LGBT smoking cessation clinic compared to the general smoking cessation clinics for LGBT people? • Is not declaring sexual orientation affecting the health of those people not out to their GP? Do LGB people visit the GP less frequently as a consequence? Do LGB people present serious symptoms and signs later than otherwise?  • How can GP surgeries be made more LGB-friendly?  • Do trans people have similar issues with GP accessibility?  • How successful are privately paid-for LGB mental health counselling services compared to NHS counselling for LGB people?  93LGBT health • How successful are privately paid-for trans mental health counselling services compared to NHS counselling for trans people? • How can more lesbians and bisexual women at risk for cervical cancer be encouraged to attend regularly for cervical smears? • How can NHS services and personnel be helped to become much more LGBT friendly? Health behaviours • How much exercise do LGBT people take? • Do LGBT people eat an adequate diet? If diet is poor, what is the most effective way of improving the situation? 6.2 Recommendations for practice This systematic review has highlighted a number of service delivery areas that also need to be addressed. There needs to be:  • Compliance of all NHS services with current legislation and The NHS Constitution • Routine confidential sexual orientation and gender identity monitoring across all health services and use of this monitoring to improve services  • Routine confidential sexual orientation and gender identity data collection in all research, in a similar way to ethnicity, gender and age data collection currently undertaken • LGB and Trans focused education of all healthcare workers • LGBT-specific health service provision where required. Otherwise, explicitly LGBT-friendly mainstream service provision.   94LGBT health 7.

LGBT health  129Appendix 5. Critical appraisal of the systematic reviews and primary studies  Bos et al. (2005) The methods section of this systematic review is very brief and the aim of the review is relatively vague – to give an overview of the empirical research into lesbian families. As the focus of the review was unclear, it is difficult to say whether all of the right papers were found. There is a risk that the results of the review were driven by the data found, rather than by a protocol designed before the review commenced. It is not clear how decisions for inclusion and exclusion of studies were made. There is no Quorom diagram to show how many citations were found in the database searches. There was no mention of quality assessment of studies. Results were combined narratively, no meta-analysis was made, yet it states in the discussion, for example, that there were no differences in child outcomes between planned and heterosexual families, so it was unclear how they arrived at that conclusion. The results of this review should be viewed with caution.   King et al. (2008) This systematic review had a very comprehensive and explicit search strategy; it is unlikely that studies would have been missed. However, it included a study that looks like a case-control study (Herrell et al, 1999) that enrolled 103 gay male pairs and 103 non-gay male pairs. This looks odd compared to all of the other studies where there were different numbers of LGB people to non-LGB people in the studies, so they looked much more like prevalence studies. Also, it appears that each male pair was counted as one and not two. However, this study is very small compared to the other studies so is unlikely to have made much impact on the final results. The study by McCabe et al looks like it was reported twice – once with male and female LGB students for the outcome of alcohol misuse (included in meta-analysis) and once for female bisexual students for the outcomes of suicide (included in meta-analysis) and alcohol misuse (not included in meta-analysis). This means that the possible double counting for alcohol misuse was spotted and appropriate action taken.   With regard to assessment of study quality, appropriate note was taken of potential factors that could cause biased results. It is inevitable that the included cross-sectional studies will be of relatively poor quality. It was stated that the meta-analysis estimates from all studies were broadly similar to results in the better quality studies. It does not say whether that better quality studies demonstrated less heterogeneity of results. However, the numbers may have been too small to demonstrate this.  Random effects models were presented in the report, even where there was little or no statistical heterogeneity. It is presumed that this was done because of the clinical heterogeneity between the studies (different study designs, different populations in different countries, etc). Given the consistency of results, it is unlikely that the results found in the meta-analyses are chance findings.    LGBT health Table 56.

Publication and grant application issues The inclusion criteria for this systematic review specified peer-reviewed published studies. In order for any piece of research to be included it had to have an ISBN number AND some indication that it had been peer reviewed. Peer-reviewing is always present for articles in scientific journals. It may have been done for reports – in which case there would be a statement in the acknowledgements section thanking two or more people for their independent peer-review. If there was any doubt, the authors were asked. None of the Sigma Research reports on their website are peer reviewed (Personal communication, Ford Hickson, Sigma Research, Sept 2008). The Stonewall Prescription for Change report has no ISBN number and has not been peer-reviewed (Personal Communication, Ruth Hunt, Stonewall, Aug 2008).   The reasons for only including peer-reviewed, published literature are as follows: • Peer-review was considered important to ensure that the most accurate studies were included in the report.  • Only including peer-reviewed, published literature highlights how little LGBT research has so far achieved publication.   As regards accuracy, an illustration of the disparity between peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed articles on the same topic can be seen from two reports of the same research by Hawton and colleagues. In a book called ‘By their own young hand’107 it states that  “Females who were worried about their sexual orientation were four times more likely than females without such worries to report deliberate self-harm, and males with such worries were more than twice as likely as other males to report deliberate self-harm” However, in a journal article published in the British Medical Journal on the same study, the odds ratios for self harm of young people with sexual orientation worries compared to those without was 4.04 for males and 2.66 for females.108 Therefore it is most likely that the book, which was probably not intensively peer reviewed, has the odds ratios for self harm reversed between the sexes by accident.   Reports that have not been fully published are known as grey literature. There are numerous grey literature reports listed in Appendix 3. There is no doubt that many more of these exist but they are hard to obtain systematically. Some are available on LGBT websites and others are available directly from the authors, if you know who to ask. It is unclear how many attempts have been made to fully publish these reports in peer-reviewed publications. However, it is known that it is very difficult to get LGBT research published (Personal communication, Professor Ian Rivers, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, November 2008). It is notes that there is a lack of published research on LGBT health other than on HIV and AIDS.96 One reason for this could be a difficulty with getting LGB health research published. One recent article on lesbian health took 15 months to publish in BMC Public Health.109 The systematic review by Professor King and colleagues took 13 versions before it was finally accepted in BMC Psychiatry.19 It was interesting to note that the mean number of versions (range) for the 20 papers published in BMC Psychiatry each side of this paper was 6.8 (4-11). Other authors have had to publish work in USA instead of the UK.89,90110,111 Of the 11 included quantitative papers and 14 included qualitative papers in this systematic review, approximately half were published in USA publications. This difficulty with getting LGBT research published has resulted in specialist journals being set up such as the Journal LGBT health  136of Homosexuality in the USA. There is no equivalent UK Journal but there are suggestions that one may be organised (Personal communication, Andy Mullen, Northumbria University, November 2008).   It has also been noticed by LGBT health researchers that grant funding for LGBT health research is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the UK. (Personal communication, Ford Hickson, Sigma Research, Sept 2007, Professor Ian Rivers, Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, November 2008). Stonewall approached numerous health research funders to support the Prescription for Change survey but finally obtained a grant from Lloyd’s Bank (Personal communication Ruth Hunt, Stonewall, September 2008). It has also been noticed in the US that there is very little non HIV/AIDS research on LGBT health.96 As a result if this difficulty with obtaining grant funding, UK LGBT health researchers are now starting to consider co-operative activities between researchers in different universities, such as information swapping on who has applied for which grants etc, rather than being in competition with each other, even if inadvertently, in order to increase the chances of obtaining some funding (personal communication, Andy Mullen, Northumbria University, November 2008).

    "abstract": "It is estimated that approximately 3-8% of the UK population identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans (LGBT). Until now, most health research on gay and bisexual men has been around HIV, AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and for trans people has been on the transitioning process only. However, it has been apparent to the LGBT community that that there are a wide variety of other physical and mental health issues that are also important and that the proportion of gay and bisexual men who have HIV/AIDS is relatively small. Very little general LGBT health research has been published so far and there are very few health services that specifically address the general health concerns of the LGBT community. This systematic review presents all available research conducted in the West Midlands on LGBT health since 2000. Local health research is compared to UK national, peer reviewed and published LGBT health research in order to determine whether the local results are unusual compared to national LGBT data, and to routinely collected data on the UK population, where appropriate, in order to determine whether and where the LGBT population differ from the general population. Only UK research has been included because there was no previous UK specific\r\nsystematic review so it was unclear how generalisable foreign research would be to the UK",
