And there are out-of-sight good deeds such as theongoing work of Food Recovery Network volunteers who spend their nights packaging uneatenle\u0000overs from the Dining Commons and delivering it to local women’s shelters. Whether it's takingaction or adding their voices to support a cause, Roger Williams University students, faculty and sta\u0000have responded to the di\u0000cult issues arising in the national dialogue with a desire for raising thecollective conscience and working toward solutions.10/31/2018  Creating a More Inclusive Community through Social Justice Activism | Roger Williams Universityhttps://www.rwu.edu/news/news-archive/creating-more-inclusive-community-through-social-justice-activism 2/6“Students have been very active and demanding in recognition of social justice issues on campus,from the creation of all-gender bathrooms to the student body’s demand for a course on diversity,”said Autumn Quezada-Grant, associate professor of history at RWU. “In many ways, this socialjustice initiative has not been top-down, but coming from the bottom up. This has been a truegrassroots movement through collaboration between students, faculty, sta\u0000 and administration. Wehear them and we are trying to bring their voice forward.”In response to this, Quezada-Grant and Professor Laura D’Amore launched an initiative in 2012 –Social Justice Week – that brings together student groups and faculty experts for an annual week inOctober aimed at sparking dialogue and inspiring the campus community around a variety of socialjustice issues. They held a Social Justice Summit in 2014 during which students, faculty and sta\u0000unpacked the term “social justice” and helped stimulate a culture of social activism. And for twoyears, they led a Social Justice and Diversity Faculty Learning Community, a multidisciplinaryprofessional development that educated faculty members on how to address issues of social justiceand diversity and incorporate these topics into their courses.With momentum continuing to build on campus, Quezada-Grant and D’Amore were inundatedwith requests from professors and students wanting to participate in this year’s annualprogramming. Now called Social Justice Month, it’s expanding in its sixth year to an entire month oflectures, interactive workshops, \u0000lm screenings and other activities that explore questions ofidentity, racism, elder justice, environmental issues and more. It’s part of the university’s yearlongseries, “Talking About Race, Gender and Power,” which aims to engage the community in informeddialogue on the intersection of race, gender and power and to work toward practical solutions.“In the national spotlight are questions about race, racial justice and patriotism, about transgenderrights, about climate change and clean energy – these are questions about marginalization,disenfranchisement, and inequality,” said Quezada-Grant. “We have all these \u0000ash points in thenational dialogue that polarize us. This makes it even more critical to have these conversations, tounderstand what the problems are and to think of solutions.”With many more opportunities to understand the issues, learn how to become an advocate and toconnect with allies across campus, Social Justice Month kicks o\u0000 this week with the Social JusticeInvolvement Fair where more than 26 student clubs, organizations, academic courses, andworkshop leaders will highlight the work they do and how to get involved.
