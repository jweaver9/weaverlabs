In Obergefell v. Hodges,6 the case in which the Court held that the fundamental right to marry extends to same-sex couples, the majority drew on Loving repeatedly to support its reasoning.7  Loving features in controversies over whether state laws protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons from discrimination in public accommodations and other areas of civic life violate the First Amendment rights of those with conscientious or religious objections to same-sex marriage.  In Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission,8 for example, baker Jack Phillips and his amici seek to distinguish the “bigotry” and odious racism behind antimiscegenation laws from Phillips’s sincere, “decent and honorable” religious convictions about marriage.9  Defenders of state antidiscrimination laws, in response, enlist Loving to show that discrimination “justified” by history, tradition, or religious motivation, however sincere, should not prevail.10 This Article argues that Loving illustrates a theme of generational moral progress in our constitutional jurisprudence:  laws once justified by appeals to nature, God’s law and plan for the races, and the well-being of children and society are now repudiated as rooted in prejudice.  In Obergefell, Justice Kennedy stated that “[t]he nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times”; “new insight[s] reveal[] discord between the Constitution’s [commitments and] . . . received legal stricture[s].”11  Thus, with such insight, the Court struck down antimiscegenation laws in Loving and “invidious” laws embodying gender hierarchy in marriage.12  As Justice Ginsburg wrote in United States v. Virginia (VMI),13 “the history of our Constitution . . . is the story of the extension of constitutional rights and   4.

I.  PREJUDICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL MORAL PROGRESS:  ARGUMENTS IN LOVING The Court’s opinion in Loving shows traces of Virginia’s various rationales for its antimiscegenation laws.  Chief Justice Earl Warren quotes, without comment, the trial court’s famous theological justification: Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents.  And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages.  The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.20 Appeals to scripture to defend antimiscegenation law and oppose any form of racial integration had long been a staple in judicial opinions and political rhetoric.21   14.

Naim,22 on which the Virginia Supreme Court relied in its Loving opinion.23  Naim asserts that an “unbroken line of decisions”—with the exception of the California case Perez v. Lippold24—does not read the Fourteenth Amendment as denying states the power to regulate marriage to prevent “the corruption of blood” and a “mongrel breed of citizens” that would “weaken or destroy the quality of its citizenship.”25  Warren described these supposed “legitimate purposes” as “obviously an endorsement of the doctrine of White Supremacy” and concluded that “no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination” justified Virginia’s antimiscegenation law.26  In addition to this Equal Protection Clause holding, the Court held that the law violated the Due Process Clause by restricting the fundamental right to marry by means of invidious racial discrimination.27 These holdings made it unnecessary for the Court to engage with Virginia’s more “modern” argument that, because “the scientific evidence is substantially in doubt” as to “whether there was any rational basis for a State to treat interracial marriages differently from other marriages,” the Court “should defer to the wisdom of the state legislature in adopting its policy of discouraging interracial marriage[].”28  The Lovings and their amici countered that antimiscegenation laws reflected and perpetuated racial prejudice.29  This tension demonstrates how Virginia attempted to escape the racist origins and purposes of its antimiscegenation law by recasting it as a legitimate way to deal with the psychological and sociological problems arising from interracial marriage. II.  ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF VIRGINIA’S ANTIMISCEGENATION LAW This Part discusses how Virginia attempted to offer an alternative, scientific argument against interracial marriage by drawing on sociological concerns about the supposed effects of interracial marriage on marital success and child well being.  In doing so, this Part illustrates how Virginia analogized interracial marriage to other “problematic” marriages that the state could bar while ignoring how its “scientific” evidence also applied to legally permitted marriages, such as interfaith marriage.  views, which mirrored those of millions of Americans at the time, no one questioned his sincerity either or his religious conviction.”).  22. 87 S.E.2d 749 (Va. 1955).  23.

See infra Part III.A. 2018] CONSTITUTIONAL MORAL PROGRESS 2705 A.  Not Racial Prejudice, but Preventing Problem Marriages Doomed by “Difference” In Loving, Virginia argued that its antimiscegenation law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because the framers intended to exclude such laws from its terms; thus, the Court should not inquire into “the wisdom, propriety or desirability of preventing interracial alliances.”30  Alternatively, Virginia argued that “if the Fourteenth Amendment [is] deemed to apply to state antimiscegenation statutes, then this statute serves [the] legitimate legislative objective of preventing the sociological and psychological evils [that] attend interracial marriage.”31  Specifically, Virginia relied on Rabbi Albert I. Gordon’s 1964 book Intermarriage:  Interfaith, Interracial, Interethnic as “the most recent scientific treatise upon the propriety or desirability of interracial marriages from the psychological and sociological point of view.”32 Virginia attempted to recast its antimiscegenation law as rooted not in racial prejudice and white supremacy but on “today’s evidence” about the detrimental “psychological aspects” of intermarriage.33  During oral argument, the Justices repeatedly asked Assistant Attorney General Robert McIlwaine whether Virginia’s Racial Integrity Act was anything other than “the result of the old slavery days, the old feeling that the white man was superior to the colored man, which was exactly what the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to prevent.”34  McIlwaine conceded that the Act, as a whole, rested on a premise of white superiority, but he urged that the issue should be restricted to whether the two specific provisions in question were justifiable in 1967.35  That contemporary justification, he contended, citing Gordon’s book as principal authority, stemmed from the psychological and sociological problems such marriages posed.36 Virginia, however, used Gordon’s book strategically and selectively.  It brushed aside Gordon’s lengthier treatment of—and warnings against—interfaith marriage.  In enlisting Gordon’s book to show that interracial marriage was especially harmful for children, Virginia left out Gordon’s reasoning for that argument:  that such children are likely to suffer the same “discriminatory practices,” “indignities,” and complete lack of acceptance by white society as their parents.37 Virginia related its antimiscegenation law to its “natural, direct, and vital interest in maximizing the number of successful marriages [that] lead to stable homes and families, and in minimizing those [that] do not.”38  It   30.

Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 18, at 27. 2706 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 asserted that “the most recent available evidence on the psycho-sociological aspect of this question [indicated] that intermarried families are subjected to much greater pressures and problems than are those of the intramarried”; thus, its “prohibition of racial intermarriage” stood on “the same footing” as other restrictions, such as barring polygamous, incestuous, and underage marriages, and marriages by “people who are mentally incompetent.”39  Virginia enlisted Gordon’s book to give “statistical form and basis to the proposition that, from a psycho-sociological point of view, interracial marriages are detrimental to the individual, to the family, and to the society.”40 Virginia also enlisted Gordon to deflect charges of racial prejudice.  It quoted Gordon’s rejection of “the argument that persons who oppose intermarriage—religious or racial—are per se prejudiced” and his retort that “the tendency to classify all persons who oppose intermarriage as ‘prejudiced’ is, in itself, a prejudice.”41  While some people’s opposition may rest in “prejudice,” Gordon acknowledged “the desire to perpetuate one’s own religion [and] to prevent its assimilation [as] understandable and reasonable”; “neither races of man nor religious or ethnic groups need offer apologies for their desire to perpetuate themselves.”42  Citing Gordon, McIlwaine attempted to recast Virginia’s law as being not about “racial superiority or inferiority” but simply racial difference,43 and he argued that children of the intermarried are harmed by such “difference” in marriage44 and that higher divorce rates arise from such difference.45 Virginia’s brief included numerous passages from Gordon about the importance of “like marrying like” as a formula for marital happiness and divorce prevention.46  But Gordon applied that formula to religion as well.47  At oral argument, Chief Justice Warren observed that some people have “the same feeling about interreligious marriages”—that intermarried families face (in McIlwaine’s words) “greater pressures and problems than . . . the intramarried”—and asked whether the state could also prohibit interreligious marriage for that reason.48  Warren’s observation and question echoed an observation made nearly twenty years earlier, in Perez v. Lippold, when the Supreme Court of California struck down California’s antimiscegenation law:  “If miscegenous marriages can be prohibited because of tensions suffered by the progeny, mixed religious unions could be prohibited on the   39.

He devotes far more of his book to interfaith (interreligious) marriage.52  The book’s criticism of both forms of “intermarriage” is clear even from the passages Virginia quoted in its brief.  For example, Gordon warns that “intermarriage” introduces “major differences,” whether religious or racial, that make marital success less likely and divorce more likely than in the “average” marriage: A rereading of the factual material contained in this study of intermarriage in its various forms, and of its effects on those who intermarry, leads me to the conclusion that intermarriage is actually a threat to ultimate happiness, that the problems that result from the major differences in religion and race are so weighty as to require that those who would intermarry be persons of far greater strength and courage than is ordinarily required in marriage.  If, in the average marriage, there are differences that must be resolved and adjustments that must be made, and if, even then, the divorce rate is about one in every three marriages, we may expect that the divorce rate for the intermarried will be much greater.53 Such higher risks of divorce, Gordon argues, support the conclusion that “intermarriage is unwise for most individuals and must, therefore, be regarded as a threat to both personal and group happiness.”54  Instead, “the chances of happiness in marriage are greatest for those who are culturally, socially, educationally, temperamentally, ethnically, nationally, racially, and religiously more like than they are different from each other.”55  Interfaith and interracial marriages, Gordon asserts, pose “a threat to the children of such” marriages because they “tend to make [children] marginal in their relationships to parents, their faiths or their races.”56 Gordon rejected the argument that intermarriage, of whatever form, was a sign of progress.  Thus, Virginia quotes Gordon’s emphatic insistence that there was no evidence that intermarriage might be a path to realizing “[u]niversal brotherhood, freedom from prejudice, intolerance and hatred of   49.

Why Are Interracial Marriages Problem Marriages? Virginia deployed Gordon’s book strategically to argue that interracial marriage causes children to suffer but ignored the role of racial prejudice in causing that suffering.  At oral argument, the Court pressed McIlwaine on whether “one reason that marriages of this kind are sometimes unsuccessful is the existence of the kind of laws that are in issue here, and the attitudes that those laws reflect.”65  McIlwaine tried to shift from the role of law by quoting   57.

Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 18, at 29. 2018] CONSTITUTIONAL MORAL PROGRESS 2709 Gordon’s observation that society’s “attitude . . . toward interracial marriages . . . ‘causes a child to have almost insuperable difficulties in identification.’”66  McIlwaine added that “‘the problems [that] the child of an interracial marriage faces are those which no child can come through without damages to himself’” given a state interest in “protecting the progeny of interracial marriages from these problems.”67 A closer look at Gordon reveals that the social “attitudes” causing those problems are racial prejudice and hostility.  Thus, although children of intermarriage—whether interfaith, interracial, or interethnic—suffer, racial prejudice makes the children of such marriages particularly “socially unfortunate.”68  Gordon explains that, in interfaith marriages, because the household does not share a religion, the couple often experiences difficulties and children lack a clear identity, lack security, and experience divided loyalty.69  Turning to the harms to children from interracial marriage, Gordon is briefer and starker:  “The children born of Negro-white marriages in the United States are, I believe, among the most socially unfortunate persons in all the world if they seek or expect acceptance by the white community in America.”70  He also warned that, as teenagers, children will encounter the general refusal of whites in the United States to allow “interdating.”71  In language unwittingly mirroring Virginia’s interpretation of its antimiscegenation law (the “one drop” rule), Gordon takes the baseline of racial prejudice as a given: To date there is no evidence that persons with even one drop of Negro blood will, knowingly, be accepted as whites. . . .  He must find his roots within the Negro community or remain unaccepted and unacceptable to the white community.  It will do no good to argue whether whites are correct in taking such an attitude.  It is far more important to know that, realistically speaking, this unfortunately is their attitude.72 Even though Gordon published Intermarriage in 1964, as Congress debated what became the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, he does not give credence to the possibility of moral progress through civil rights.  Instead, for him, racial prejudice is a moral argument against interracial marriage.  Thus, after detailing the pervasive discrimination against “the Negro in the United States,” Gordon asserts: Unless a miracle occurs that will eliminate discrimination from our society—and that does not seem probable—we may expect such children   66.

Whether people, however much they may love each other, have the moral right to create such a problem for a child is, of course, debatable.  It is my belief that interracially intermarried parents are committing a grave offense against their children that is far more serious and even dangerous to their welfare than they realize.73 Omitting the above passage, Virginia’s brief quotes Gordon’s conclusion that “[t]he chances for the success of an interracial marriage are, according to my research, even less than for that of an inter-faith marriage.”74  Virginia also omits the basis for Gordon’s conclusion, that “obvious difference in skin color makes for an unfavorable societal attitude toward the intermarried” such that “[p]ersons who entertain the thought of entering into an interracial marriage should know that they and any children born to them will suffer many hardships and disadvantages as the result of such a marriage.”75  Gordon asserts, “I believe that the institution of marriage certainly does not require that we make martyrs of ourselves and of our children.”76 This closer look at Gordon clarifies that, in his view, racial prejudice and discrimination made interracial marriage particularly fraught with problems.  Without condoning it, Gordon treats such prejudice as a social fact.  But he also offers his “personal view,” which seems to be a pluralistic vision of the normative good stemming from preserving differences—religious, racial, and national—rather than eliminating them.77  Virginia quotes this vision: I believe that basic differences will not be eliminated. . . .  [T]he most we can hope and work for with any degree of moderate success is that we will grow more accustomed to the idea that it is possible for persons of different colors, races, nations and religions to work together in many areas even while retaining their distinctiveness.78 Virginia may have quoted this passage to attempt to hold the line on dismantling legally compelled racial segregation at marriage after so fiercely resisting school desegregation in Brown v. Board of Education.79  The context, however, is not legal prohibition of intermarriage but rather Gordon’s skepticism that “intermarriage”—whether interfaith, interracial, or interethnic—is the path to greater social harmony and the end of “prejudice, intolerance, and hatred.”80  Once again, Virginia quotes selectively, omitting the reason Gordon criticizes the belief that more black-white marriages could overcome the “race problem,” that “Negroes” still lack “social equality” and,   73.

GORDON, supra note 37, at 361. 2018] CONSTITUTIONAL MORAL PROGRESS 2711 although some “Negro and white college youth” may meet and marry, the present attitude of “the white man to the Negro” is not likely to change for at least a generation.81  Gordon’s quiescence toward the status quo is in striking contrast with one of his mentors, social psychologist Gordon W. Allport.  In The Nature of Prejudice, Allport acknowledged that prejudice made interracial marriage inadvisable under the current conditions, but he also argued for dismantling legal segregation and working for conditions that made those marriages possible.82  Allport observed, “It is because intermarriage would symbolize the abolition of prejudice that it is so strenuously fought.”83 III.  ARGUMENTS MADE BY THE LOVINGS AND THEIR AMICI The Lovings’ counsel engaged Virginia’s reliance on Gordon only briefly.  At oral argument, Bernard Cohen read the following passage from Intermarriage:  “[O]ur democracy would soon be defeated if any group on the American scene was required to cut itself off from context with persons of other religions or races.  The segregation of any group, religious or racial, either voluntarily or involuntarily, is unthinkable and even dangerous to the body politic.”84  In contrast to Virginia’s selective use of Gordon’s theory to demonstrate harms to children from interracial marriage, the Lovings and their amici countered that prejudice created the problems.  This Part focuses on the role, in their arguments, of appeals to constitutional moral progress of repudiating prejudice and discrimination in light of the gradual realization of constitutional commitments to equality and liberty. A.  Racial Prejudice and Constitutional Moral Progress The Lovings urged the Court to take this “appropriate opportunity to strike down the last remnants of legalized slavery in our country.”85  Antimiscegenation laws were “both relics of slavery and expressions of modern day racism which brand Negroes as an inferior race.”86  Antimiscegenation laws, the Lovings argued, “are legalized racial prejudice, unsupported by reason or morals, and should not exist in a good society.”87  This appeal to “morals” and a “good society” is powerful, given the repeated quoting—in defenses of antimiscegenation laws—of Maynard v. Hill88 and its notion that marriage has “more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any other institution.”89  Moral progress requires abandoning such unsupportable laws.   81.

Id. at 205. 2712 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 The amicus briefs in support of the Lovings similarly linked Virginia’s laws to racial prejudice and urged their demise as an important measure of constitutional progress.90  The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (the “Fund”) asserted that such laws rested on an “amalgam of superstition, mythology, ignorance and pseudoscientific nonsense summoned up to support the theories of white supremacy and racial ‘purity.’”91  Further, the trial court’s appeal to “Almighty God” also illustrated the appeal to theology, which is not a sufficient rationale under the Fourteenth Amendment to implement racial discrimination.92 The Lovings’ brief also highlights the interplay of racial prejudice and white men’s “sore conscience” under the “illicit conditions fostered by the miscegenation laws”:  they quote Gunnar Myrdal on white men’s sexual exploitation of “the Negro female” and the fixation on “the purity of white womanhood.”93  They argued that such laws are the “paradigm” of measures expressing “the subordinate status of the Negro people and the exalted position of the whites . . . functioning chiefly as the State’s official symbol of a caste system.”94  They “inflict[] indignity upon every person cast . . . as not good enough to marry a ‘white person.’”95 The Japanese American Citizens League also situates the striking down of Virginia’s law within a narrative of moral and constitutional progress by asserting that “[t]he torchlight of the Constitution has been wielded to expose and burn away these remaining shackles to individual liberty and to cast forth light extending “to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue.”96  The group’s brief debunks ideas of a pure race and of racial superiority by arguing that Virginia’s law is “readily exposed as a racist, ‘white supremacy’ law.”97  The brief invokes interfaith marriage to condemn legal bans on interracial marriage:  “no one would seriously contend” that various forms of bans on marriage based on differences—such as “between Protestants and Catholics . . . would be constitutional.”98  As with religion, so with race:  “Whatever differences may exist between these groups cannot provide proper bases for fixing public policy.”99   90.

Id. 2018] CONSTITUTIONAL MORAL PROGRESS 2713 The Fund’s Brief situates invalidating racial prohibitions on marriage as part of the “never-ending struggle” of the “Negro in the United States” for “full and equal citizenship” and against “laws, customs, practices, usages and opinion relegating him to an inferior status.”100  It further invokes the Court’s striking down of “all other segregation laws” in urging the Court to strike down the antimiscegenation laws, and it argues that these laws “intrude a racist dogma into the private and personal relationship of marriage,” which is inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.101 B.  Modern Science, Race Prejudice, and Harms to Children While Virginia stressed the harms to children born into interracial marriages as a reason to prohibit such marriages,102 the Lovings stressed the “immeasurable social harm” (including to children) caused by prohibiting those marriages, including rendering children illegitimate.103  To show the absence of any rational basis for Virginia’s law, the Lovings and their amici enlisted modern scientific understanding of race, particularly the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO) 1952 “Statement on the Nature of Race and Race Differences,” which found that “no biological justification exists for prohibiting intermarriage between persons of different races.”104  Amici argued that Virginia’s rationales about mongrelization and race mixture (as embraced in Naim) are “abhorrent to” present day science and jurisprudence.105  Although Chief Justice Warren asked counsel for Virginia his opinion about the “very cogent findings on the racist view” in the UNESCO report,106 his opinion “stopped short of refuting the validity of race as a biological category.”107  But in concluding that the purpose of Virginia’s law was to “maintain white supremacy,”108 Loving was the “capstone of the Court’s blow to the Jim Crow regime.”109 In the only amicus brief filed on behalf of the Lovings by religious leaders and institutions, the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice, the   100.

Roberts, supra note 3, at 207–08.

Roberts, supra note 3, at 208.  109. Id. at 176. 2714 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 National Catholic Social Action Conference, and several Catholic bishops and archbishops in southern dioceses (including Richmond, Virginia) asserted that third parties’ “race prejudice” creates suffering for “parties to an interracial marriage” and their children—not “anything inherent in the family structure of the marriage.”110  By contrast to some studies of the harmful effects of polygamy (to which Virginia compared interracial marriage), there is no proof that “an interracial marriage, because of the nature of such a marriage, is likely to engender similar harmful effects.”111  Further, they argued that the government should not allow the racial prejudice of third persons to justify restrictions on the freedom to marry.112  The brief quotes Perez v. Sharp113:  “it is ‘no answer to say that race tension can be eradicated through the perpetuation by law of the prejudices that give rise to the tension.’”114 These briefs provide an important contrast to Virginia’s appeal to “social attitudes” (i.e., racial prejudice and intolerance of interracial marriage) to justify perpetuating legalized racial discrimination.  They also bring to mind the Supreme Court’s later statement about racial prejudice in Palmore v. Sidoti115:  “Private biases may be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot, directly or indirectly, give them effect.”116 CONCLUSION Reflecting on Loving invites questions about when “new insights” regarding objectionable discrimination and the need to realize better the Constitution’s promises are possible.  When same-sex couples, nearly fifty years after Loving, challenged Virginia’s defense of marriage laws (“DOMA”), the Attorney General of Virginia declined to defend the bans and asserted that he did not want to be “on the wrong side of history.”117  He criticized his predecessors, who chose to defend racially discriminatory laws in Loving and Brown and sex-discriminatory laws in VMI.118  Similarly, the Solicitor General of Virginia argued, in federal district court, that the “legal principle” of equality was clear in those earlier cases; the problem lay in “the   110.

In response, Virginia sought to distance such laws from prejudice and white supremacy by appealing to “the most recent” social science that identified problems posed by “intermarriage,” particularly for children. Such work also rejected the idea that intermarriage was a path toward progress and freedom from prejudice.
