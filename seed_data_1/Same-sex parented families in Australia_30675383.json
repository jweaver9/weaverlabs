Children may have been \nconceived in the context of previous heterosexual relationships, or raised from birth by a co-parenting \ngay or lesbian couple or single parent.\n  Overall, research to date considerably challenges the point of view that same-sex parented families \nare harmful to children. Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as \ntheir peers from heterosexual couple families.\n  Some researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they \nexperience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughter \ndisplay more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity.\n  The possible effect of important socio-economic family factors, such as income and parental education, \nwere not always considered in the studies reviewed in this paper.\n  Although many Australian lesbian-parented families appear to be receiving good support from their \nhealth care providers, there is evidence that more could be done to develop policies and practices \nsupportive of same-sex parented families in the Australian health, education, child protection and \nfoster care systems.\n  Additional key messages, relating to specific family structures and psychosocial outcomes for children \nraised by lesbian and gay parents, are included throughout the paper.\nKEY MESSAGES\nSame-sex parented families \nin Australia\nDeborah Dempsey\nThis research paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on same-\nsex parented families. It includes discussion of the different modes of conception or family \nformation, different family structures, and the small number of studies on bisexual and \ntransgender parents. Particular attention is paid to research on the emotional, social and \neducational outcomes for children raised by lesbian and gay parents, and the methodological \nstrengths and weaknesses of this body of work.\nCFCA PAPER NO. 17 2013\n2  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nAustralian families have changed considerably in recent decades, and many children are now born to \nunmarried parents, and/or raised in families that do not conform to the two biological parent nuclear form \n(see Hayes, Weston, Qu, & Gray, 2010). One manifestation of this change is the increasing prevalence \nand visibility of same-sex parented families.\nOver the past 10 years in many Australian states and territories, same-sex couple and parenting relationships \nhave gained considerable legal recognition. These developments have ensued from community activism \nand the increasing social acceptability of same-sex couple relationships. For instance, reproductive \nmedicine clinics in a number of states have extended their donor insemination and IVF services to \nlesbians and also changed their Status of Children legislation, to enable the legal recognition of lesbian \nco-parenting couples, irrespective of which partner gave birth. The Federal Family Law Amendment (de \nfacto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act 2008 now enables cohabiting same-sex couples legal \nprotection under the Family Law Act with regard to child and property concerns (Sifris, 2010). Civil union \nschemes exist in four Australian states and the ACT in addition to this federal recognition of same-sex \ncohabiting relationships (Richardson-Self, 2012).\nAmerican psychologist Frederick Bozett noted in 1987 that research into lesbian and gay parenting \nwas preoccupied with “ethical consideration for the well-being of the child” (p. 171). This remains \ntrue in the early 21st century, despite the considerable inroads that have been made into the legal and \nsocial acceptance of same-sex relationships. Critics often argue that children’s wellbeing requires two \nresident opposite sex parents, and that same-sex couples of either sex cannot provide a supportive \nfamily environment (for summaries of the arguments see Clarke, 2001; Dempsey, 2006; Millbank, 2003; \nPatterson, 2007; Short, Riggs, Perlesz, Brown, & Kane, 2007). Stereotypes of gay male sexuality would \nhave it that gay men are uninvolved and uninterested in parenting or children (see Barret & Robinson, \n2000; Bozett, 1987; Mallon, 2004), or that their sexual conduct is incompatible with forming or raising \nfamilies with children (Barret & Robinson, 2000; Stacey, 2004). Such arguments are not based on a \ncomprehensive assessment of the evidence for this claim and are usually informed by religious or \nideological beliefs about what constitutes a family.\nThis research paper describes the diverse characteristics of same-sex parented families in Australia, their \nsupport needs and experiences, and the challenges they may face given the stigma and discrimination \noften attached to homosexuality and encountered by some same-sex couples. It also examines the \ninternational research into the wellbeing of children raised by lesbian and gay parents, commenting \non the methodological issues associated with this body of research, and its relevance to Australian \npolicy-makers.1 Most studies to date indicate that children raised in same-sex parented families do as \nwell emotionally, socially and educationally as their peers in comparable kinds of heterosexual families, \nalthough there are some differences between children raised in same-sex and other kinds of families \nbeginning to be noted and more openly discussed.2 These include benefits in the quality of parenting \nchildren receive when raised from birth by lesbian couples, greater gender flexibility, particularly for \nsons, and their greater acceptance of family diversity. Furthermore, although many lesbian-parented \nfamilies appear to be receiving good service from their health care providers, there is evidence that \nmore could be done to develop policies supportive of same-sex parented families in the education, child \nprotection, and foster care systems.\nDiversity in Australian same-sex parented families\nSame-sex attracted parents and their children are still a small minority of Australian children and \nparents. Children with lesbian or gay parents comprise 0.1% of all dependent children in the population \n(Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2013). In the 2011 Census, 33,714 same-sex couples were counted \nand 12% of these couples had dependent or adult children living with them, a figure slightly higher than \nthe 11% of lesbian or gay parents counted in the 2001 Census (see ABS, 2002). The continuing stigma \n1 While most of the research on the wellbeing of children growing up with lesbian and gay parents has been conducted overseas, a growing body of Australian research \ndocuments family formation practices, and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) families’ interactions with the health, educational and community services \nsystem in Australia. The country of origin of the research is stated throughout this report. \n2 For comprehensive earlier reviews of the international literature on lesbian and gay parenting by Australian scholars, see Millbank, 2003; McNair, 2004; and \nShort et al., 2007. \nFamilial language used in this report\nLanguage describing “non-heterosexual” family relationships is controversial and evolving, and there is no \nconsensus on correct terminology (see Brown, 2008; Dempsey, 2012a; du Chesne & Bradley, 2007; Gabb, \n2005; Weeks, Heaphy, & Donovan, 2001). In this report, “same-sex parented families” is used when the point \nbeing made is relevant to all non-heterosexual families, and “lesbian-parented” or “gay-parented” when the \npoint relates to families headed by female and male same-sex couples or sole parents, respectively.\nIt is also important to note that “lesbian” and “gay” are not universally used as self-descriptors by women \nand men who are parenting in the context of a same-sex relationship or identity. The complex interconnection \nbetween sexual attraction, sexual behavior and a more overarching sense of sexual identity or orientation \nhas long been noted in sexuality surveys since Alfred Kinsey’s formative work in US in the 1940s, including \nthose conducted in Australia (e.g., Dempsey, Hillier, & Harrison, 2001; Smith, Rissel, Richters, Grulich, & de \nVisser, 2003). Some Australian same-sex attracted parents (indications are, a small minority) may consider \nthemselves “bisexual” or refer to themselves as “queer” rather than “lesbian” or “gay” because they have \nsexual or romantic relationships with people of both sexes (see Power et al., 2010; Power, Perlesz, Brown et al., \n2012). As there is very little research on experiences of parenting or outcomes for children of bisexual parents, \nbisexual parents are only explicitly mentioned in this report when they were included as a specific participant \ngroup in the research under discussion.\nTerminology to describe mothers, fathers, parents and sperm donors in same-sex parented families is also \ncontested. In families in which a lesbian couple co-parent, usually both women consider themselves to be \nmothers, irrespective of who gave birth to the children, while in some families, there is a clearer distinction \nbetween the mother (the woman who gave birth) and the “co-parent” or “non-biological” or “non-birth” \nmother. In this report, “lesbian co-parenting couples” is used or the terms “mother” and “co-parent” when \ndistinguishing between the two women is relevant. “Anonymous sperm donor” or “known sperm donor” are \nthe usual terms for describing biological fathers of children in planned lesbian parent families (although see \nDempsey, 2012a) and in cases where these men have parental involvement in children’s lives (which is often \nnot the case) they are referred to as “donor dads” or “co-parents”, depending on context.\n“Transgender” describes people who have had hormone treatment or surgery to reconstruct their bodies, or \nthose whose appearance, comportment and self-identification transgresses usual sex and gender categories in \nless permanent fashion (see Couch et al., 2007; Hines, 2006). Given there is very little literature on the family \nlives or children of transgender parents (for exceptions see Green, 1998; Hines, 2006; Riggs, forthcoming), \ntransgender parents are only referred to when they were specifically included in the research under discussion.\nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  3\nAustralian families have changed considerably in recent decades, and many children are now born to \nunmarried parents, and/or raised in families that do not conform to the two biological parent nuclear form \n(see Hayes, Weston, Qu, & Gray, 2010).

There is no population-based data available on numbers of bisexual or transgender \nparents, or children raised by bisexual or transgender parents.\nGay men are less likely than lesbians to be resident parents (ABS, 2012). It is much more common for \nfemale than male same-sex couples to have children living in the household (22% compared with 3%; \nABS, 2012), a trend that is echoed in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community-based \nsurveys conducted with women and men. In Private Lives 2—a recent national Australian survey of 3,835 \nLGBT people’s relationships, health and wellbeing—about 11% of gay male participants indicated that \nthey were parents or step-parents, or had some other kind of parent-like relationship with children, as \nopposed to 33% of lesbian participants (Leonard et al., 2012). Considerably more bisexual men than \ngay men in the study reported having children (40% vs 11%), with bisexual men also more likely than \nbisexual women (40% vs 25%) to report having children.\nSame-sex parented families are characteristically diverse with regard to mode of conception or family \nformation, and family structure (see Anderssen, Amilie, & Ytteroy, 2002; Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Gunn & \n4  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nSurtees, 2009; Power et al., 2010; Tasker & Patterson, 2007; Weeks et al., 2001). Some parents have children \nin heterosexual marriages or relationships, and then re-partner with someone of the same-sex, while \nothers have children in the context of same-sex couple or single parent families. In intentionally planned \nlesbian or gay parented families, it is common for children to be conceived through assisted reproductive \ntechnologies (ART) such as known or anonymous donor insemination (DI), in-vitro fertilization (IVF) \nand surrogacy. The children are usually biologically related to at least one of the parents, as is common \nin the case of a prior marriage or when ART procedures are used. Many transgender men and women \nbecame parents in the context of heterosexual relationships before making the decision to transition (see \nGreen, 1998; Hines, 2006) although more recently, also post-transition. Riggs (forthcoming) argues that \nsince reports of US-resident “pregnant man” Thomas Beatie appeared in the media in 2008, the visibility \nof transgender men having children post-transition has increased considerably.3\nSame-sex attracted parents also have children through foster care and adoption (see Goldberg, 2010; \nHicks, 2006; Riggs, Agoustinos, & Delfabbro, 2007) although in Australia the former is much more \ncommon than the latter. Many lesbians and gay men who become foster carers do so as a first option \nfor starting a family rather than as “second best” alternative to biological reproduction (Hicks, 2005a; \nMallon, 2004). Across Australia, some foster care agencies now actively recruit lesbian and gay carers \n(Riggs, 2011) and regularly advertise in the LGBT press. In cases where Australian lesbian or gay parents \nare raising adopted children, it is highly likely these children were adopted in the context of a previous \nheterosexual relationship due to the legal prohibition on same-sex adoption in Australian states and \nterritories. Further to this, and for a range of reasons, very few Australian children become available for \nadoption beyond their families of origin (see Higgins, 2012).\nThe Work, Love and Play study (Power et al., 2010) of 445 Australian and New Zealander lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) parents is the largest in this country undertaken to date and \nfound there are six major family types: \n  a two-parent same-sex couple-based family; \n  families in which a lesbian couple were the primary parents but a known sperm donor lived separately \nand had involvement in the children’s lives; \n  families in which a lesbian or gay man were still co-parenting with an ex-heterosexual partner; \n  separated same-sex families where women or men were co-parenting with their ex-same-sex partner; \n  sole parent families; and \n  multi-parent families, usually a gay male couple and a lesbian couple raising children together from \nbirth across two households. \nDespite the diversity, it is apparent that the two-parent, couple-based household family form still holds \nsway, and many same-sex parented families in Australia conform to this family structure (Power et al., \n2010).\nThere are also differences in levels of education and labour force participation rates of same-sex couples \ncompared to heterosexual couples in Australia. Data from the 2011 Census indicate that people in same-\nsex couples are more likely to hold a Bachelor degree or higher qualification (42% compared to 23% \nof people in heterosexual couples). More people in same-sex couples are participating in the labour \nforce (89% compared to 69% of heterosexual couples) and are more likely to work in highly skilled \noccupations, such as professionals or managers (ABS, 2013).4\n3 Female-to-male transgender people may have fully functional female reproductive organs that enable them to become pregnant and give birth while also exhibiting \nthe secondary sex characteristics of men. Similarly, male-to-female trans people may have breasts and other secondary sex characteristics of women, while electing \nnot to have the kind of gender reassignment surgery that would remove their penis or testes (see Couch et al., 2007). \n4 It is possible that this finding in the Census data could relate to the stigmatisation of same-sex relationships. Same-sex couples with a high socio-economic status \ncould be more comfortable disclosing their same-sex relationship in government data collections.\nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  5\nKey messages: Diversity in Australian same-sex parented families\n  About 11% of Australian gay men and 33% of lesbians have children, based on data from a recent lesbian, \ngay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community survey of 3,853 people.\n  Children may have been conceived in the context of previous heterosexual relationships, or raised from \nbirth by a co-parenting gay or lesbian couple or single parent.\n  In intentionally planned lesbian or gay parented families, it is common for children to be conceived through \nassisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as donor insemination (DI), in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and \nsurrogacy. The children are usually biologically related to at least one of the parents.\n  Lesbian and gay parents also have children through foster care and adoption, although in Australia gay and \nlesbian couples or singles are still not eligible to adopt children.\n  Despite the diversity, many same-sex parented families in Australia conform to the two-parent, couple-\nbased household family form, although a small number of multi-parent families exist.\n  People in same-sex couples are more highly educated and are more likely to be in highly skilled occupations \nthan people in heterosexual couples.\nLesbian-parented families\nFar more published research exists on the characteristics and experiences of lesbian parented families \nthan families parented by gay men (see Andersson et al., 2002; Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Patterson, 2007; \nShort et al. 2007; Tasker & Patterson 2007). This reflects the greater likelihood of lesbians, as women, \nbeing resident parents.\nEquity in divisions of paid work and domestic labour between mothers and co-parents has been found \nto be the rule rather than the exception in lesbian-parented families (Dalton & Bielby, 2000; Dunne, \n2000; Perlesz et al., 2010; Reimann, 1997; Sullivan 1998). Data from the 2011 Census indicate that in \nfemale same-sex couples, 59% of partners engaged in the same amount of unpaid domestic work such \nas housework, food preparation, laundry and gardening, compared to 38% of partners in opposite-\nsex couples (ABS, 2013). Dunne (2000) emphasised that it is the lack of “gendered scripts” in lesbian \nrelationships that leads to greater egalitarianism in relation to the sharing of economic resources and \ndomestic duties including child-rearing. Perlesz et al. (2010) compared the divisions of labour of 317 \ncohabiting Australian and New Zealander lesbian and gay parents who took part in the Work, Love \nand Play study with 958 cohabiting heterosexual parents taking part in the Australian Negotiating the \nLife Course study. They found that lesbian couples, some of whom had had children in heterosexual \nrelationships and some of whom had raised children together from birth, divided their household labour \nmore equally than the heterosexual couples. Lesbian couples in the study also divided their parenting \ntasks more equitably than the Negotiating the Life Course comparison group.\nLesbian co-parenting couples display a range of parenting strengths. In a recent meta-analysis conducted \nin the US, Crowl, Ahn, and Baker (2008) found that on average, parents of children in planned lesbian-\nparented families reported higher quality relationships with their children than parents in comparable \nheterosexual families.5 Lesbian co-parenting couples have been found to have greater parenting skills \nand to devote more time to parenting than matched samples of heterosexual couples. Several studies \ncomparing donor-conceived children parented by heterosexual and lesbian couples found that the lesbian \ncouples had greater parental awareness and problem-solving capacity, had higher quality interactions \nwith children, were more available to them, and demonstrated more respect for children’s independence \n(Bos, van Balen, van den Boom, & 2007; Brewaeys, Ponjaert, van Hall, Golombok, 1997; Flaks, Ficher, \n5 Meta-analysis is a technique researchers can use once numerous published studies of the same phenomenon become available. It is useful for alleviating the problem \nof inconclusive results in individual studies. Meta-analysis enables researchers to group together findings from a number of studies and apply statistical tests to see \nif the results found in the individual studies still hold. Also, the advantage of a meta-analysis is that the larger size of the pooled data set lends more evidence to any \nconclusions drawn in the smaller studies (see Allen & Burrell 1996; Marks, 2012; Schumm, 2012).\n6  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nMasterpasqua, & Joseph, 1995; Golombok, Tasker, & Murray, 1997). Lesbian co-parenting couples in \nother studies of donor-conceived children have been found to spend more time with their children than \ntheir heterosexual counterparts. This includes time spent in imaginative play, and on shared interests or \nactivities (Golombok et al., 1997; Golombok et al., 2003; MacCallum & Golombok, 2004). In the Avon \nLongitudinal Study of Children in the UK lesbian mothers tended to engage in less smacking than the \nheterosexual mothers in the study (Golombok et al., 2003). A study by Johnson and O’Connor (2002) \nin the US found that the lesbian (and gay male) parents reported less use of corporal punishment and \nmore use of reasoning techniques with children than a normative sample of American parents. It is \nimportant to acknowledge, however, that some of the research literature on parenting has compared \nlesbian couples with heterosexual couples without taking into account differences in levels of parental \neducation, social class and household income (e.g., Bos et al., 2007; Crowl et al., 2008). It is possible that \nthe differences in the demographic characteristics of lesbian couples compared to heterosexual couples \nmay explain any differences observed between the two groups.\nAlthough most lesbian couples form two-parent families, there are a number of ways in which they \ninvolve the biological father and/or other men in their family lives (see Biblarz & Stacey, 2010; Dempsey, \n2006; Goldberg, 2010; Goldberg & Allen, 2007; McNair, Dempsey, Wise, & Perlesz, 2002). Some lesbian \nparents either choose not to or cannot involve the biological father in their families, yet value the \ncontribution of other male friends and family members (see Dempsey, 2006; Donovan & Wilson, 2008; \nShort, 2007). McNair and colleagues (2002) found that known sperm donors were preferred by Australian \nlesbian mothers for a range of reasons, including (at that time) limited legal access to clinical donor \ninsemination, wanting children to have access to knowledge about their biogenetic paternity, the desire \nto give a male friend the chance to have children in their lives, or belief in the importance of male role \nmodels for children (see also Clarke, 2006; Clarke & Kitzinger, 2005; Goldberg & Allen, 2007; Ryan-Flood, \n2005). Other lesbian mothers believe it is important for their children to have contact with men rather \nthan the biological father per se (see Clarke, 2006; Clarke & Kitzinger, 2005; Goldberg & Allen, 2007). \nWomen’s fathers, brothers and heterosexual or gay male friends are known to be valued as “male role \nmodels” for children, due to lesbian parents’ desire for children to have access to diverse adult male and \nfemale social networks (Borthwick & Bloch, 1993; Gartrell et al., 1996; Goldberg & Allen, 2007; Wakeling \n& Bradstock, 1995).\nKey messages: Lesbian-parented families\n  Lesbian co-parenting couples tend to divide their household labour and child care responsibilities more \nequitably than heterosexual couples. This includes lesbian couples parenting children conceived in previous \nheterosexual relationships as well as couples who have raised children together from birth.\n  Lesbian co-parenting couples display a range of parenting strengths, for example, less authoritarian \nparenting styles, and report higher quality relationships with their children than matched samples of \nheterosexual parents. They also tend to spend more time with their children.\n  An important limitation of the literature to date is that some samples were not matched on education \nand income and therefore demographic factors may explain differences found between lesbian and \nheterosexual couples.\n  With regard to family formation in planned lesbian-parented families, known or identifiable sperm donors \nare often preferred by Australian lesbian mothers. This is for a range of reasons including: wanting children \nto have access to knowledge about their biogenetic paternity, the desire to give a male friend the chance \nto have children in their lives, or belief in the importance of male role models for children.\nFamilies parented by gay men\nGay fatherhood research prior to the late 1990s tended to be US-based and emphasised the experiences \nof divorced gay fathers who had had children in heterosexual marriages, mostly with regard to issues \nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  7\nassociated with disclosing their gay relationships or identity to children, and their perceptions of children’s \nadjustment to their homosexuality (see Barret & Robinson, 2000; Bigner & Bozett, 1990; Bozett, 1987; \nMiller, 1979). Since the early 2000s, the focus of research into gay male parenting has become more \ninternational and shifted towards documenting the increasing compatibility between “coming out” as \ngay and becoming a parent through adoption, surrogacy, co-parenting and “donor dad” arrangements \nwith lesbian couples (e.g., Berkowitz, 2007; Berkowitz & Marsiglio, 2007; Dempsey, 2006, 2010, 2012a, \n2012b; Goldberg, Downing, & Moyer, 2012; Johnson & O’Connor, 2002; Power, Perlesz, McNair et al., \n2012b; Riggs 2008a, 2008b; Stacey, 2004, 2006; Weeks et al., 2001). The increasing social acceptability of \ngay relationships, coupled with social shifts in definitions of appropriate families and indeed the “baby \nboom” among lesbian couples has facilitated gay men’s “procreative consciousness” (Berkowitz, 2007; \nBerkowitz & Marsiglio, 2007), or awareness that parenting can be rewarding and compatible with living \nan openly gay life.\nAustralian gay men’s pathways to parenthood are diverse, although relatively limited compared to their \ncounterparts in the US. Some continue to become parents in the context of heterosexual relationships \n(see Higgins, 2004; Power, Perlesz, McNair et al., 2012) and others through foster and permanent care \n(Riggs, 2007, 2011), known sperm donation (Dempsey, 2010, 2012a,b; Riggs, 2008a, 2008b; Ripper, 2008) \nand surrogacy (Dempsey, 2013, forthcoming; Rudruppa, 2011; Tuazon-McCheyne, 2010). Australian gay \nmen’s history of involvement in known sperm donation for lesbian friends and acquaintances dates from \nat least the 1980s (see Borthwick & Bloch, 1993; Dempsey, 2005; van Reyk, 1995; Wakeling & Bradstock, \n1995) and some men have developed paternal or parental relationships with children conceived in this \nway (see Dempsey, 2010, 2012a, 2012b; van Reyk, 2004). Since the early 2000s, it has become popular for \nAustralian gay men to form families through surrogacy, particularly commercial surrogacy arrangements \nin the US and India (see Dempsey, 2013, forthcoming; Millbank, 2011; Stethoscope Research 2012; \nTuazon-McCheyne, 2010). In the US, adoption is a well documented path to parenthood for gay men \n(Goldberg, 2010; Goldberg, Downing, & Moyer, 2012; Mallon, 2004) although Australian laws prevent \nthis. In the Work, Love and Play study (Power, Perlesz, McNair et al., 2012), of the 88 gay and bisexual \nmen who described themselves as “actively involved” in parenting a child, 39% had become parents in a \nprevious heterosexual relationship, 23% were parenting children conceived through surrogacy with their \nmale partners, 19% had become parents through known sperm donation to lesbian couples or singles, \nand 11% were foster parents or permanent carers.\nSimilarly to studies on lesbian-parented families, the strengths of gay fathers as parents have been noted. \nJust as co-parenting lesbian couples have been found to share housework and parenting more equitably \nthan heterosexual couples, indications are that gay male couples tend to be more like their lesbian than \nheterosexual peers in this regard. Stacey (2004) found the gay male couples in her study did not privilege \npaid work over homemaking, and that the partners who worked outside the home tended to see this as a \ncompromise that took them away from the children. In Johnson and O’Connor’s (2002) study of gay and \nlesbian parents in the US, the male couples were more compatible in their parenting styles and parented \nmore equitably than comparable samples of US-resident heterosexual couples. They also displayed more \nauthoritative than authoritarian parenting styles when compared to heterosexual peers. Although there \nare far fewer studies to date of co-parenting gay male couples or single parent families than planned \nlesbian-parented families, indications are the way two men parent together is closer to lesbian couples \nand heterosexual women’s approach than the greater detachment from children’s daily care characteristic \nof fathers in conventional nuclear families (Schacher, Auerbach, & Silverstein, 2005; Biblarz & Stacey, \n2010; Mallon, 2004; Stacey, 2006). It should be acknowledged, however, that socio-economic differences \nsuch as income and education were not always taken into account in these studies.\nSeveral studies of gay fathers have also noted higher self-esteem (Bergman et al., 2010; Sbordone, 1993; \nSchacher et al., 2005) and fewer negative attitudes about homosexuality than men who are not parents \n(Sbordone, 1993). It is also apparent that having children is a great source of personal fulfillment and \npride for gay men, that brings with it greater connectedness to their own parents and other members of \ntheir family of origin (Tuazon-McCheyne, 2010; Bergman et al., 2010; Power, Perlesz, McNair et al., 2012).\n8  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nKey messages: Families parented by gay men\n  Gay men’s pathways to planned parenthood are more restricted in Australia than in the US and UK due to \ntheir inability to adopt children and the prohibition on commercial surrogacy. Many gay fathers are divorced \nmen who continue to co-parent with their ex-wife. Some Australian gay men become sperm donors for \nlesbian friends and acquaintances, and maintain non-resident involvement with the children. A newer \ngroup of gay fathers have formed families through commercial and altruistic surrogacy abroad, and this \nmode of family formation has become increasingly popular in the past 5 years.\n  Although there are far fewer studies to date of co-parenting gay male couples or single parent families than \nplanned lesbian-parented families, indications are that two men parenting together have more equitable \ndivisions of domestic and parental labour than exists in heterosexual couple families; however some studies \nhave not taken socio-economic differences into account.\n  Gay male parenting has also been linked to higher self-esteem for the men involved than that of their \nchildless gay male peers, and improved social and emotional relationships with their families of origin.\nTransgender parents\nAs Biblarz and Savci (2010) pointed out, transgender people undergo a change in their gender \nidentification, which conceivably raises quite different issues for parent, child and family relationships \nthan lesbian or gay sexuality. A need for recognition of the desired gender status as opposed to the \ngender nominated on original birth certificates is a key issue of concern to transgender people (see Couch \net al., 2007; Hines, 2006). As Couch et al. (2007) pointed out, transitioning, or the act of masculinising \nor feminising one’s body to bring it into line with the desired gender identity (often but not always \nthrough hormone treatment and/or gender reassignment surgery) is an important part of the transgender \nexperience. This perhaps explains why exploration of the health and legal or social discrimination issues \nfaced by transgender individuals, rather than their familial or parental relationships, predominate in the \npublished literature.\nIt is clear that transgender parents face discrimination and lack of acceptance from family members, \nincluding their children, as a consequence of transitioning. Green (1998), who has interviewed numerous \ntransgender parents over time at a gender reassignment clinic in London, commented that partners of \ntransgender parents may feel such abandonment and hostility towards their ex-partner that they oppose \nthem having any contact with children. In the TranZnation report (Couch et al., 2007), the largest study \nof the health and wellbeing of transgender Australians and New Zealanders ever undertaken, the 253 \nparticipants were not asked if they had children, or how parenting related to their health and wellbeing. \nHowever, comments about family relationships were contributed in “open” qualitative responses made \nabout health and wellbeing. Participants reported being “sent to Coventry” by their spouses or ex-\nspouses and children due to inability to accept or understand the desire to transition. There were also \ninstances where spouses or ex-spouses refused to allow them to have contact with young children. A \nfew participants, notably those whose gender transitions took place later in life, reported that most of the \ndiscrimination they had experienced came from other family members, including adult children.\nHines (2006), in a qualitative study of the family and relationship practices of 30 transgender men and \nwomen in the UK, found that complex decisions about the timing of gender transitions are negotiated \nin a context that takes into account existing family commitments, partner relationships, and likely effects \non children. When and how to tell children about the forthcoming gender transition were uppermost for \nthe parents in the participant group. Hines saw parallels here with lesbian and gay parents who have \nconceived their children in prior heterosexual relationships and are faced with the prospect of how \nand when to “come out” to children. Divorce or partnership breakdown often results when transgender \nparents make the decision to transition, and this can lead to difficult parenting relationships, particularly \nif the child or children live with the other parent. Hines (2006) found that the transgender parents \ninterviewed in her study also emphasised the importance of maintaining positive relationships with their \nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  9\nchildren’s other parent, and expressed the view that good relationships with ex-partners made it easier \nfor their children to cope with the gender transition.\nHines (2006) also emphasised the importance participants placed on helping their children come to \nterms emotionally with the physical changes in their parents undergoing a gender transition. Strategies \ntransgender parents described included being open and honest with children in response to their \nquestions and concerns about the gender transition, and using first names or nicknames rather than \ninsisting their children shift from calling them “mummy” to “daddy” or vice versa. Hines’ participants’ \nexperiences indicated that children of parents who transition from female to male rather than from male \nto female may find it easier to adapt because their parent was already perceived as quite androgynous \nbefore the transition. Hines speculated this could relate to the greater cultural acceptance of female \nandrogyny as opposed to male femininity.\nKey messages: Transgender parents\n  Transgender parents face discrimination and lack of acceptance from family members, including their \nchildren, as a consequence of transitioning. This may include banishment by their spouses or ex-spouses \nand children due to inability to accept or understand the desire to transition, or situations in which ex-\nspouses refuse to allow them to have contact with young children.\n  How and when to tell children about the gender transition is a key theme in qualitative research with \ntransgender parents.\n  Transgender parents who had children prior to their transition emphasised the importance of maintaining \npositive relationships with their children’s other parent, and expressed the view that good relationships \nwith ex-partners made it easier for their children to cope with the gender transition.\nChildren’s wellbeing in same-sex parented families\nTo date, there has been far more research conducted on the wellbeing of children raised by lesbian \nparents than children raised by gay male, bisexual or transgender parents. Studies conducted prior to the \nlate 1990s focused on same-sex parented children conceived in the context of heterosexual relationships \n(see Andersson et al, 2002; Barret & Robinson, 2000; Tasker, 2005; Tasker & Patterson, 2007, for reviews). \nA considerable body of literature comparing children raised in planned lesbian-parented families with \nsamples of heterosexual families now exists (see Anderssen et al., 2002; Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Crowl et \nal., 2008; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001; Tasker & Patterson, 2007). At the time of writing, there were no known \npublished comparative studies of children’s development or wellbeing in families created by gay men \nthrough surrogacy, and only one comparing children in families with known “donor dads” with children \nfrom heterosexual parented families (Bos, 2010). Furthermore, no comparative research of this kind has \nbeen conducted in Australia or New Zealand.\nOne study into the health and wellbeing of children in Australian LGBT parented families has recently \ncommenced and only preliminary data and information about the study were available at the time of \nwriting (Crouch, Waters, McNair, Power, & Davis, 2012, Crouch, 2013). The Australian Study of Child \nHealth in Same-Sex Families (ACHESS) based at the University of Melbourne has collected data on 500 \nchildren aged 0–17 years from 315 LGBT parents. The study is based on self-report data from parents \nand children, and utilised the Child Health Questionnaire and the Infant and Toddler Quality of Life \nQuestionnaire. For 80% of the children a female parent completed the survey, 18% were completed by \na male parent, and 2% were completed by an other-gendered parent. On measures of general health \nand family cohesion children aged 5 to 17 years with same-sex attracted parents had significantly better \nscores when compared to Australian children from all other backgrounds and family contexts. For \nall other health measures there were no statistically significant differences. These preliminary findings \nindicate Australian children with same-sex attracted parents are developing well.\n10  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nTo turn now to closer analysis of the literature comparing children in same-sex parented families \nwith children raised in other kinds of families, this body of literature arises from a range of largely \nunsubstantiated concerns about the effect of parental sexual orientation on children’s development or \nwelfare (see Bozett, 1987; Clarke, 2001; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001). There are several kinds of concerns \nguiding the literature: those relating to children’s family relationships; their psychological adjustment; \ntheir experiences with peers, particularly with regard to teasing or bullying; and concerns about their \nsexuality or gender identity. Further to this, a number of studies also consider how well lesbian- and gay-\nparented children fare educationally. Each of these themes are discussed in turn. In the final section of \nthis part of the report The New Family Structures Study published in the US in 2012 is discussed, given \nthis is the only study to date reporting harms to children raised in same-sex parented families.\nParent–child and family relationships\nChildren in lesbian- and gay-parented families generally report harmonious relationships with their \nparents, whether or not they were born to heterosexual couple parents who subsequently divorced, or \nin the context of a planned same-sex family (Brewaeys et al. 1997; Bozett, 1987; Golombok, Spencer, \n& Rutter, 1983; Harris & Turner, 1986; Kirkpatrick, Smith, & Roy, 1981; Wainright et al. 2004). Wainright \net al. (2004), in a randomly sampled representative survey of 44 young people raised in lesbian or gay \nparented families in the US, found the teenagers described relationships with their parents as warm and \ncaring. Other studies have also found that lesbian-parented children reported more warmth from and \ninteraction with their parents than their peers raised in heterosexual couple families (Golombok et al., \n1997; Golombok et al., 2003). Children who are parented by lesbian couples display greater security \nof attachment to parents (Golombok et al., 1997, 2003), are more likely to perceive their parents as \navailable and dependable (MacCallum & Golombok, 2004), and are more likely to discuss sexual and \nemotional issues with parents (Vanfraussen, Ponjaert-Kristoffersen, & Brewaeys, 2003). Some studies have \nconsidered the family relationships of children of divorced gay fathers. Bigner and Jacobsen (1989, 1992) \nsurveyed gay and heterosexual divorced fathers who were members of parenting groups. In responses \nto their inventory of parenting practices, the authors found the gay fathers were more responsive to \ntheir children’s needs than the heterosexual fathers, and reported more use of reasoning strategies with \nchildren.\nThere is some suggestion that children raised from infancy by lesbian couples in the UK may be more \nlikely than children of heterosexual couples to experience their parents’ separation (MacCallum & \nGolombok, 2004). Gartrell et al. (2005, 2006) also commented on the higher than average separation rate \namong the lesbian couples in the US based National Longitudinal Study of Lesbian Families. Researchers \ncomment that more studies are needed in order to confirm this finding, and speculate that it could be \ndue to the relative lack of institutional support for lesbian co-parenting relationships (see Biblarz & \nStacey, 2010).\nHistorically, many lesbians and gay men have had difficult relationships with or been rejected by their \nfamilies of origin because of their sexuality (Carrington, 1999; Weeks et al., 2001; Weston, 1991). However, \nthe transition to parenthood is often reported to bring new parents closer to their families of origin, and \nchildren appear to have good access to grandparents. Gartrell et al. (1996) found that lesbian parents in \nthe National Longitudinal Lesbian Families Study reported strong social support from their parents. Most \ngrandparents were very happy about having grandchildren, and grandparents’ openness about their \ndaughters’ lesbian-parented families increased over time (Gartrell et al., 1999, 2000, 2006). Goldberg \n(2007) also found that both partners in lesbian couples received increased support from their own \nparents in the transition to parenthood. In a study that explicitly compared the amount of contact that \nchildren had with grandparents in different family types, parental sexual identity did not make a difference \nto the amount of contact children had with their grandparents (Fulcher, Chan, Raboy, & Patterson, 2002). \nA recent study of gay men creating families through commercial surrogacy in the US found that the \ntransition to parenthood brought them closer to their other family members, particularly mothers, and \nthat grandparents take a keen interest in their grandchildren (Bergman et al., 2010).\nMethodological issues and studies of children’s wellbeing\nEvaluating the effects of family structures upon children’s wellbeing and development is complicated, \nparticularly when the population of interest is a very diverse, stigmatised, numeric minority. Some questions \nhave been asked about the methodological rigor of research studies on the wellbeing of children raised in \nsame-sex parented families, by scholars who (implicitly or explicitly) have political or moral objections to same-\nsex parenting (see Marks, 2012; Regnerus, 2012; Schumm, 2012) and by those who do not. For instance, \nTasker and Patterson (2007), two respected psychologists who support the rights of lesbian and gay parented \nfamilies and have published widely on various aspects of the wellbeing of children raised by lesbian and gay \nparents, commented that the field would benefit from a wider variety of data collection methods. They noted \nthat most of the data collected about children raised in lesbian and gay parented families comes from self-\nreports by their parents, supplemented with psychometric testing of children by the research team. Few studies \nhave been blind, or made use of psychometric tests administered independently of the researchers. That said, \nmany researchers emphasise the importance of contextual, qualitative studies in learning about the family \nexperiences and processes in same-sex parented families from the point of view of parents, children and other \nfamily members (Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Dempsey, 2012b; Goldberg, 2010; Goldberg, Kinkler, Richardson, & \nDowning, 2011; Lindsay et al., 2006; Riggs, 2007).\nResearchers in this field have noted a range of limitations with regard to how their samples of participants \nare drawn. Although this is beginning to change, many studies are based on small and homogenous samples \nof highly educated and middle-class participants. Many of the comparative studies conducted to date on \nchildren or young adults raised in same-sex parented families are based on volunteer samples of participants \nrather than random samples. This means that it is unknown how representative and generalisable the studies’ \nresults are. Further to this, many researchers in this field note that their participants were mostly white and \nwell educated, which does not reflect the likely socio-economic, ethnic and racial diversity of the same-sex \nparenting population. That said, it is important to emphasise all research designs have limitations and not \nto dismiss the cumulative findings from many small scale or volunteer sample studies, as some critics of this \nliterature attempt to do (see Marks, 2012; Regnerus, 2012; Schumm, 2012). Amato (2012) indeed pointed \nout that if there were noteworthy harms accruing to children resulting from parental homosexuality per se, \nwhich is often the concern of those scholars who criticise research designs and methodology, these would be \nrevealed in research on high socio-economic, ethnically homogenous samples of parents and children.\nSome randomly sampled nationally representative data projects now include questions that enable the \nidentification of gay, lesbian and bisexual respondents. These include the National Longitudinal Study of \nAdolescent Health and other health-oriented surveys in the US (see Biblarz & Savci, 2010) and The Avon \nLongitudinal Study of Children in the UK (see Golombok et al., 1997, 2003; Golombok & Badger, 2010; \nMacCallum & Golombok, 2004). There have now been several randomly sampled comparative studies published \non educational outcomes for children from same-sex and heterosexual families (Potter, 2012; Rosenfeld, 2010), \nand also social outcomes (Regnerus, 2012; Wainwright, Russell, & Patterson, 2004). Even the critics concede it \nis extremely difficult to use random, representative samples of same-sex families in comparative or other kinds \nof research. For instance, Schumm (2012) noted that large random samples are extremely expensive and often \nappear not to yield sufficient numbers of same-sex parents for quantitative analysis.\nWell-designed longitudinal research, which enables following the same families over a number of years, can \nprovide valuable data on how lesbian and gay parented children fare over time. The National Longitudinal \nLesbian Families Study (NLLFS) in the US (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006; Gartrell & Bos, 2010; \nGartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser, & Banks, 2005; Gartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser, & Banks, 2006;) utilises in-depth \ninterviews, and standard measures of child development to chart the wellbeing of children raised from birth \nby lesbian mothers. Gartrell and colleagues recruited 154 prospective lesbian mothers to their study between \n1986 and 1992, and have followed them from conception until early adulthood. The study is ongoing, with a \n93% retention rate to date.\nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  11\nTo turn now to closer analysis of the literature comparing children in same-sex parented families \nwith children raised in other kinds of families, this body of literature arises from a range of largely \nunsubstantiated concerns about the effect of parental sexual orientation on children’s development or \nwelfare (see Bozett, 1987; Clarke, 2001; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001).

These include the National Longitudinal Study of \nAdolescent Health and other health-oriented surveys in the US (see Biblarz & Savci, 2010) and The Avon \nLongitudinal Study of Children in the UK (see Golombok et al., 1997, 2003; Golombok & Badger, 2010; \nMacCallum & Golombok, 2004). There have now been several randomly sampled comparative studies published \non educational outcomes for children from same-sex and heterosexual families (Potter, 2012; Rosenfeld, 2010), \nand also social outcomes (Regnerus, 2012; Wainwright, Russell, & Patterson, 2004). Even the critics concede it \nis extremely difficult to use random, representative samples of same-sex families in comparative or other kinds \nof research. For instance, Schumm (2012) noted that large random samples are extremely expensive and often \nappear not to yield sufficient numbers of same-sex parents for quantitative analysis.\nWell-designed longitudinal research, which enables following the same families over a number of years, can \nprovide valuable data on how lesbian and gay parented children fare over time. The National Longitudinal \nLesbian Families Study (NLLFS) in the US (Gartrell et al., 1996, 1999, 2000, 2006; Gartrell & Bos, 2010; \nGartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser, & Banks, 2005; Gartrell, Rodas, Deck, Peyser, & Banks, 2006;) utilises in-depth \ninterviews, and standard measures of child development to chart the wellbeing of children raised from birth \nby lesbian mothers. Gartrell and colleagues recruited 154 prospective lesbian mothers to their study between \n1986 and 1992, and have followed them from conception until early adulthood. The study is ongoing, with a \n93% retention rate to date.\n12  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nPsychological adjustment and cognitive development\nThree meta-analyses (all conducted in the US) have now been published that consider whether and \nhow the sexual orientation and/or gender of parents is associated with particular aspects of children’s \ndevelopment (Allen & Burrell, 1996, 2002; Crowl et al., 2008). All have concluded that being raised \nin a lesbian- or gay-parented family has negligible influence on children’s psychological adjustment. \n“Psychological adjustment” encompasses children’s emotional wellbeing, their capacity to adhere \nto socially defined standards of appropriate behaviour, the quality of their relationships with peers, \nthe degree of stigmatisation they experience, their self-esteem, and overall mental health. Allen and \nBurrell, in 1996 and again in 2002, found no statistical differences between the lesbian- or gay- and \nheterosexual-parented children on any measures with regard to children’s psychological adjustment, \nwhether the data included was based on parents’ reports, teachers’ reports of children’s behaviour, \nor reports from the children themselves. The authors concluded each time there was no reason for \nUS courts to continue their bias against same-sex parents. In 2008, Crowl and colleagues investigated \nchildren’s psychological and cognitive adjustment across 19 different studies. These authors also found \nno differences between children raised in lesbian- or gay-parented and heterosexual-parented families \nwith regard to psychological adjustment or cognitive development. In these studies, however, other \ndemographic differences between same-sex and heterosexual families, such as income and education \nlevels, were not always taken into account.\nFamily processes such as the level of conflict between the parents and the relative equity of their \ndivisions of labour are known to be associated with children’s wellbeing. As mentioned earlier, \nplanned lesbian parent families with young children are known to have more egalitarian divisions \nof parenting and household labour than matched samples of heterosexual couple families (Chan, \nRaboy, & Patterson, 1998; Patterson et al., 2004; Tasker & Golombok, 1997; Vanfraussen et al., 2003) \nalthough birth mothers tend to assume more caring responsibilities than co-parents (Ciano-Boyce \n& Shelley-Sireci, 2002; Patterson, 1995). Two studies have found an association between this more \nequitable division of child care among lesbian parents and higher scores on measures of children’s \npsychological adjustment (Chan et al., 1998; Patterson, 1995). Chan et al. (1998) additionally found that \nneither the number nor gender of parents influenced children’s psychological adjustment. What was \nimportant for all family types were family processes such as parenting stress, conflict, and relationship \ndissatisfaction. High stress, conflict and relationship dissatisfaction were associated with increased \nbehavioural problems among the children.\nLongitudinal studies have also followed the psychological adjustment of young people approaching \nadulthood who were raised in lesbian-parented families. In the National Longitudinal Lesbian \nFamilies Study in the US, the young people being followed have now reached early adulthood. Their \npsychological adjustment throughout early childhood was found to be similar to normative samples of \nAmerican children raised in all kinds of heterosexual families (Gartrell et al., 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006). \nGartrell and Boss (2010) recently reported that the 17-year-old young people in the study continued to \ndisplay healthy psychological adjustment. According to their mothers’ reports, the 17-year-old daughters \nand sons of lesbian mothers rated significantly higher in social and total competence and significantly \nlower in social problems, rule-breaking, aggressive, and externalising problem behavior than their \nage-matched peers raised in heterosexual-parented families in a normative sample of American youth. \nGolombok and Badger (2010), in a recent publication from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children \nin the UK, reported that the young adults raised from birth by lesbian couples and single mothers had \nhigher psychological adjustment scores than the children in the study raised in conventional nuclear \nfamilies.\nA small number of studies have also compared adopted children’s development in heterosexual and \nsame-sex parented households and found negligible differences based on parental sexual orientation. \nFarr, Forssell, and Patterson (2010) in the US compared 105 lesbian, gay male and heterosexual couple \nfamilies with adopted children on a range of measures. There were no inter-country adoption children \nin the study but some trans-racial adoptions, and all of the children studied were adopted as infants. \nChildren’s psychological adjustment along with the adults’ parenting approach, parental stress and \ncouple relationship adjustment were not significantly associated with the sexual orientation of the \nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  13\nadults (see also Erich, Leung, Kindle, & Carter, 2005). Lavner, Waterman, and Peplau (2012), also in \nthe US, compared the cognitive and emotional development over time (at 2, 12 and 24 months after \nplacement) of adopted children who had previously been in foster families and who were being raised \nin heterosexual or same-sex parented families. Children in both household types displayed considerable \ngains in their cognitive development after adoption in both kinds of households, in spite of the fact that \nthe lesbian and gay parents in the study were raising children who were considered “higher risk” prior \nto their adoptions. The authors concluded that adoption had been a great success for these children \nregardless of parental sexual orientation.\nSocial and peer relationships\nChildren raised in same-sex parented families generally report good social networks and friendships, \nand peer relationships that follow typical patterns. Most school-aged children report they have mainly \nsame-sex best friends and wider friendship networks (Golombok et al., 1983; Green 1978; Patterson \n1994). Children’s peer relationships tend to be positive (Green, Mandel, Hotvedt, Gray, & Smith, 1986; \nGolombok et al., 1983, 1997). Gartrell et al. (2012) found that 17-year-olds raised from birth by lesbian \nparents reported numerous close friendships that had lasted for a number of years. Most of the 78 young \npeople in this study felt comfortable with bringing friends home and informing their friends of their \nparents’ sexuality.\nAlthough relationships with friends are generally good, children raised in lesbian- or gay-parented \nfamilies are known to worry about being teased, harassed or bullied, particularly by peers in the school \nenvironment. Indications are that teenagers are more concerned about this than younger children. Fear \nof losing friends because of parental sexuality or being judged negatively by others have been reported \nin studies of the teenaged children of lesbian mothers (Gartrell et al., 2005; Lindsay et al., 2006; Ray & \nGregory, 2001; Tasker & Golombok, 1997) and children are known to use selective disclosure strategies \nwith regard to telling people about their parents’ sexuality (Bozett, 1987 ; Lindsay et al., 2006; Ray & \nGregory, 2001). In Ray and Gregory’s Australian study of children and young people raised in lesbian-\nparented families, primary school aged children reported more teasing and bullying than the high-\nschool-aged children. The 5- to 8-year-old children were found to be less aware of the potential for \nhomophobic bullying or teasing than older children. Whereas the 5- to 8-year-olds were often open \nabout having two mothers with peers at school, teenagers raised in lesbian-parented families were more \nguarded about providing this information. Although some were simply sick of having to explain their \nfamily configuration to others, other children expressed they were fearful of being bullied. Lindsay et al. \n(2006) found that teenaged children of lesbian parents used a process of trial and error to decide how to \nmanage information about their parents’ sexuality. Those who had overtly experienced discrimination, \nteasing or bullying were more likely to adopt selective or private strategies but could try a more open \nstrategy at a later date.\nDespite fears and some negative experiences of bullying, teasing or harassment, it appears children \nraised in lesbian-parented families do not seem unduly vulnerable to experiencing difficult relationships \nwith peers or bullying, although the US evidence is mixed. Comparative research has consistently found \nthat children with lesbian mothers are only modestly more likely than their peers with heterosexual \nparents to be teased about their family composition or parents’ sexuality (see Bos & van Balen, 2008; \nTasker & Golombok, 1997; Vanfraussen, Ponjaert-Kristoffersen, & Brewaeys, 2002). Rivers, Poteat, and \nNoret (2008) in the UK and Wainwright and Patterson (2006) in the US found that teenagers raised in \nsame-sex parented families were no more likely to have experienced serious bullying or victimisation \nthan their peers in conventional families. Conversely, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network \n(GLSEN) report in the US indicated relatively high levels of reported bullying and harassment (Kosciw \n& Diaz, 2008). The 588 LGBT parents and their 154 children in this study reported multiple forms of \nverbal and/or physical abuse, exclusion from representation in classrooms or requests not to talk about \nsame-sex parented families, and generalised victimisation/harassment. Just over half of the children \n(51%) reported experiencing at least one form of abuse or discrimination, with 15% of this coming from \nteachers, the remainder from other students. van Gelderen, Gartrell, Bos, van Rooij, and Hermanns \n(2012), also in the US, reported that those teenagers in lesbian-parented families who had experienced \nbullying or teasing displayed considerable resilience and used a broad range of coping skills, more \n14  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\noften adaptive (e.g., optimism, confrontation or seeking support from others) than maladaptive (e.g., \ndepression or avoidance).\nThe country in which children are raised appears to have a bearing on the likelihood of experiencing \nbullying or teasing. In the first cross-cultural study of the wellbeing of same-sex parented children raised \nin the US and The Netherlands (Bos, Gartrell, van Balen, Peyser, & Sandfort, 2008), the US-resident \nlesbian-parented children were significantly more likely than the Dutch children to report teasing by \npeers, and the US children were also less likely to disclose their family configuration to others than the \nDutch children. The authors speculated these differences were due to the greater social acceptance \nof same-sex relationships in The Netherlands, which was the first country in the world to legalise gay \nmarriage in 2001. Crouch et al. (2012) recently calculated that children’s wellbeing scores on comparable \nmeasures are higher in European countries than the US, indicating that the prevailing socio-cultural \nclimate of support for same-sex relationships may have some bearing on child wellbeing, indicating that \nthe prevailing socio-cultural climate of support for same-sex relationships has some bearing on child \nwellbeing.\nEducational achievement and school performance\nWith regard to academic performance, the evidence is that lesbian- and gay-parented children perform \nas well as or better than their peers raised in heterosexual couple families. Wainwright et al. (2004) found \nthat 44 young people with lesbian parents felt more connected to schools than those with heterosexual \nparents, and had similar grade point averages and levels of behavioural problems in the school \nenvironment. Gartrell and Bos (2010) reported similar findings to Wainwright and colleagues regarding \nschool behaviour of both groups of young people, but higher than average academic achievement among \nthe young men and women raised in lesbian-parented families (see also MacCallum & Golombok, 2004, \nin the UK). Rosenfeld (2010), also in the US, compared matched random samples of lesbian- and gay-\nparented and heterosexual-parented children, controlling for parental education, income and household \nstability of the parents and found no differences between the two groups with regard to children’s \nprogress in primary school. As some other studies that compare children’s outcomes in same-sex and \nheterosexual couples do not adjust for differences in financial resources and education, this finding can \nbe considered particularly important.\nPotter (2012) set out to test whether the reported similar or better levels of academic achievement noted \namong the children and young people in lesbian-parented families held in data gathered from a large, \nrandom and nationally representative US sample of 19,043 children. His results indicated initially that \nthe 158 children in same-sex parented families scored lower than their peers with heterosexual, married \nparents. However, when Potter controlled for experience of family transitions (i.e., parental divorce or \nseparation), the disadvantages noted in the same-sex parented group disappeared. In other words, the \ndisadvantages were better explained by family transitions the children had experienced rather than being \nraised in a same-sex parented family per se. This is in keeping with other American studies on children’s \nacademic achievement, which have found that children from single-parent, divorced or step-parented \nfamilies do not do as well educationally as their peers with two continuously married parents (see \nAmato, 2005; McLanahan & Percheski, 2008; Raley & Wildsmith, 2004). These poorer levels of school \nperformance are believed to stem from disruption and insecurity during the period of parental separation \nand re-partnering, rather than family structure per se (see Potter, 2012).\nSexual and gender identity and behaviours\nA popular belief among people who object to same-sex parents is that they will raise gay, lesbian or \ngender non-conforming children (see Barret & Robinson, 2000; Clarke, 2001; Goldberg, 2007; Stacey \n& Biblarz, 2001). From this point of view, homosexuality or gender non-conformity is a deficit, and if \nthese traits are more prevalent in same-sex parented children it constitutes evidence of harm. At the \nsame time, various psychoanalytic and other social constructionist theories of sexuality and gender \ndevelopment emphasise parental sexuality and gender relations as pivotal influences on growing \nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  15\nchildren’s sexuality and gender identity (see Hicks, 2005a, b; Goldberg, 2007; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001). \nIt is not unreasonable to expect that the sexual orientation or gender of parents would make a \ndifference to how children express some gendered behaviours and view gender relations, and their \ndegree of tolerance or acceptance of unconventional sexualities or gender. Lesbian and gay parents \nmay indeed seek to challenge prevailing stereotypes of deeply etched gender differences between \nboys and girls in their parenting practices.\nResearch to date has considered a range of different aspects of children and young people’s gender \nand sexuality such as their self-identification as male or female; the extent of their preferences for \nstereotypically masculine or feminine activities and toys; and their sexual orientation, or the extent \nto which they identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual. It has also documented same-sex \nparented young people’s sexual attractions and behaviours, as distinct from their overarching sexual \nidentity. This is important, as sexual fluidity, or same-sex as well as heterosexual attraction and \nbehaviour, is well documented among young people under 25, particularly young women (see \nDempsey et al., 2001; Diamond, 2009). With regard to self-identification as male or female, there is \nno evidence that children of lesbian mothers are more unhappy with their gender or experience more \ngender dysphoria than their heterosexual counterparts (see Green, 1978; Green et al., 1986; Golombok \net al., 1983; Kirkpatrick et al., 1981). Male to female transgender parents were included in Green’s \nstudies, although none of the above studies were of children of gay fathers. Similarly, the children \nraised by same-sex parents appear no more likely to describe themselves as conclusively lesbian, gay \nor otherwise homosexual. Numerous studies throughout the 1980s and 1990s compared the sexual \norientations of children of lesbian and gay male parents with those of heterosexual parents (Bailey et \nal., 1995; Bozett, 1980, 1987, 1989; Golombok & Tasker, 1996; Green, 1978; Green et al., 1986; Tasker \n& Golombok, 1997). All studies (some based on reports by the parents, and some on self-report by the \nyoung people) found that most young people raised by heterosexual and lesbian, gay or transgender \nparents identify as heterosexual.\nSome differences have been found in the sexual and gendered behaviour of lesbian parented, as \nopposed to heterosexual parented young people. Tasker and Golombok (1997) found that the young \nadult daughters of lesbian parents were more likely to have experienced an attraction or sexual \nrelationship with a member of the same sex. Bos et al. (2007) found that the DI-conceived 10-year-\nold daughters of co-parenting lesbian couples were less likely to conclusively consider themselves \nheterosexual than their peers raised in heterosexual couple families, and also less likely to report \nparental or peer pressure to conform to gender stereotypes. Children of lesbian mothers report less \naggressiveness (Vanfraussen et al., 2002), are less likely to believe their own sex is superior (Bos et \nal., 2006), are more tolerant of gender non-conformity in boys (Fulcher et al., 2008), and sons display \nmore gender flexibility (Brewaeys et al., 1997; MacCallum & Golombok, 2004) meaning although they \nrate similarly to sons in heterosexual families on masculinity scales, they also tend to rate higher on \nfemininity scales. Interestingly, however, daughters of lesbian mothers expressed fewer “masculine” \noccupational aspirations than the daughters of heterosexual parents (Bos et al., 2006). This is a finding \nthat was contradicted in some of the earlier studies of children of lesbian mothers, in which girls \nhad higher aspirations to traditionally male-dominated occupations than the children of heterosexual \nparents (e.g., Green et al., 1986; Steckel, 1987).\nThe New Family Structures Study\nThe New Family Structures Study (NFSS) (Regnerus, 2012) has recently created controversy in the US \nbecause its findings of harm for same-sex parented adults run counter to the results of many previous \nstudies. The NFSS surveyed a randomly chosen sample of 2,988 American adults aged 18–39 who were \nraised in a range of family types. “Same-sex parented adults” were defined as those who reported their \nmother had had a romantic relationship with another woman during their childhood (n = 163) and/or \nthose who reported their father had had a romantic relationship with another man (n = 73). Respondents \nwere asked about 40 different social and psychological issues including their history of drug and alcohol \nuse; experience of bullying; sexual experiences (including sexual abuse and forced sex); emotional \ncloseness to family of origin; history of criminal convictions; depression, overall happiness and physical \n16  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nhealth. Regnerus then compared what he defined as the “lesbian mothered” and “gay fathered” adults’ \nresults with those who grew up in six other family configurations: adoptive families (n = 101), divorced \nfamilies (n = 116), step-families (n = 394), single parent families (n = 816), married biological families \n(n = 919), and “other” (n = 406). In his discussion section, the author chose to highlight the differences \nbetween the same-sex parented families and the married biological family group.\nWhen compared with adults who grew up in families with married biological parents, Regnerus found a \nnumber of statistically significant disadvantages for adults whose parents had had same-sex relationships. \nSome of the notable differences were that adults raised by mothers who had had lesbian relationships \nwere more likely to report experience of forced sex and childhood experience of sexual abuse, they \nhad higher rates of depression, poorer sense of family-of-origin safety and security, poorer academic \nachievement, and higher marijuana use than those raised by married biological parents. The children \nraised by fathers who had had gay relationships were more likely than those of married biological \nparents to smoke, have higher rates of depression and poorer family-of-origin safety and security, to \nhave been arrested for a minor offense, and reported more numerous sexual partners.\nAlthough Regnerus (2012) ostensibly found more disadvantages for children raised in same-sex parented \nfamilies than any previous studies, it would be false to draw the conclusion that these results are cause \nfor alarm. This was certainly the consensus of the family studies scholars invited to provide expert \ncommentary on the study (see Amato, 2012; Eggebeen, 2012; Osborne, 2012). In the first instance, the \nvast majority of participants in this study were not experiencing poor wellbeing irrespective of their \nfamily structure. Second, despite the large, random sample, a major disadvantage with the research \ndesign was that it defined “same-sex parented” too loosely to be of analytic use. Many of the participants \nwith so-called “lesbian mothers” or “gay fathers” had not been raised by parents who lived with same-sex \npartners. The sampling strategy also did not enable the author to distinguish between same-sex parented \nyoung adults who have experienced their parents divorce or separation and those who have not, when \nthis could actually be critical to the results.\nBy way of comparison, in Potter’s previously mentioned 2012 US-based study of educational achievement \nfor children in a range of family types, also based on a random, representative sample of children, the \ndisadvantages that seemed associated with being raised in a same-sex parented family per se disappeared \nafter controlling for family transitions within the lesbian mother and gay father groups. Furthermore, \nthe higher levels of forced sex or parental sexual abuse for lesbian-parented adults in this study could \nwell be explained by father abuse in the mother’s prior heterosexual relationship. The author himself \nindeed makes this point (Regnerus, 2012, p. 763). By contrast, Gartrell et al. (2005), in the National \nLongitudinal Lesbian Families Study, found that 78 children parented from birth by lesbian parents \nreported experiences of sexual abuse well below the national US average, in that none of the young \npeople in the study reported being sexually abused.\nIn comparative research of this kind, the question always arises about the politics of research and what \nresearchers are seeking to find in highlighting some family type comparisons over and above others (see \nOsbourne, 2012; Stacey, 1997; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001). Amato (2012) re-analysed the Regnerus study data \nto compare differences between the adults whose parents had had gay or lesbian relationships and the \nentire group of heterosexual parented adults, on the grounds that this allowed a more accurate picture \nof the impact of parental sexual orientation. This is because most of the same-sex parented group in the \nRegnerus study would also have experienced parental divorce or separation, due to the way he drew \nhis sample. Amato (2012) found the sizes of the differences between the same-sex and heterosexual \nparented groups were small to moderate rather than large and therefore of limited cause for concern \nwhen the group of same-sex parented young adults were compared to the total group of young adults \nwith heterosexual parents. Arguably, Amato’s analytic strategy is fairer in comparing “like with like” and \ntherefore taking into account the family transitions likely to have been experienced by the participants \nin this study whose parents had had a same-sex romantic relationship.\nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  17\nKey messages: Children’s wellbeing in same-sex parented families\n  Most studies suggest that children raised by lesbian parents do at least as well as their peers with \nheterosexual parents when compared on a range of social, psychological and educational variables. Only \na few studies overseas have included children of gay men. No comparative research of this kind has been \nconducted in Australia or New Zealand.\n  Family processes such as levels of conflict between parents and their divisions of labour are more influential \nthan the gender or sexuality of parents when it comes to children’s wellbeing.\n  In several US studies with adopted children who had previously been in foster families, those raised in \nheterosexual or lesbian and gay parented families both displayed considerable gains in their cognitive \ndevelopment after adoption. This is despite the fact that the lesbian and gay parented children were \nconsidered “higher risk” prior to their adoptions.\n  Children raised in lesbian- and gay-parented families worry about being teased, harassed or bullied, \nparticularly by peers in the school environment. This may lead to very selective disclosure about their \nparents’ sexuality or family configuration. Despite this, children with lesbian mothers are only modestly \nmore likely than their peers with heterosexual parents to be teased or bullied about their family composition \nor parents’ sexuality.\n  Children raised from infancy by lesbian couples may be more likely than children of heterosexual couples \nto experience their parents’ separation. This could relate to the relative lack of institutional support for \nsame-sex relationships.\n  The country in which children are raised appears to have a bearing on the likelihood of experiencing bullying \nor teasing, indicating that the prevailing socio-cultural climate of support for same-sex relationships has \nsome bearing on child wellbeing.\nSocial support\nBecause many Australians continue to believe that the two-parent heterosexual nuclear family is \nthe optimum environment in which to raise children (Dempsey & Critchley, 2010; Morse, McLaren, \n& McLachlan, 2007), lesbian and gay parents and their children may encounter prejudice in school \nenvironments and in dealings with other institutions in the course of daily family life (Lindsay et al., \n2006; McNair et al., 2002; Ray & Gregory, 2001). In the past decade, Australian researchers have begun \nto document same-sex parented families’ experiences of the education and health care systems, in \norder to find out how supportive these systems are of their needs (Lindsay et al., 2006; Mikhailovich, \nMartin, & Lawton, 2001; McNair et al., 2002, 2008; Perlesz & McNair, 2004). Research has also considered \nthe sources of informal support families draw on in order to ensure adults and children’s wellbeing \n(McNair et al., 2002; Rawsthorne, 2009; Short, 2007). As Rawsthorne (2009) argued, this research focus \nis important to ensure the needs of parents and children can be considered and taken into account in \nrelevant social policy.\nSome studies of family functioning in lesbian-parent households indicate that informal social support \nreceived from friends, families and other community members and formal support from organisations \ncan help explain differences in children’s wellbeing (e.g., Gartrell et al., 1999). In other words, poor \naccess to social support and negative social interactions can be sources of stress that diminish parents’ \nself-esteem and resources and hamper children’s development. Support from friends, families, same-\nsex parented family-friendly organisations and communities can assist in mediating potentially adverse \naffects of legal and other forms of discrimination (Lindsay et al., 2006; McNair et al., 2002; Rawsthorne, \n2009).\nMcNair et al. (2002) explored 125 mostly Victorian and NSW-resident lesbian prospective and current \nparents’ levels of acceptance and support from informal networks and various formal health and \ncommunity service providers. They also asked about their actual and anticipated parental difficulties \n18  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nwhen dealing with services and people in their networks. They found that lesbian parents generally \nencountered high levels of acceptance and support from their informal networks and service providers. \nGPs and mental health service providers were most supportive, with child protection workers found \nto be among the least supportive. Prospective parents anticipated significantly greater difficulties for \nthemselves and their children than women who were already parents indicated was typical. Prospective \nparents also expected less support from community and health service providers than women who were \nalready parents reported receiving. This indicates that fear of prejudice or discrimination due to parental \nsexuality may outweigh actual experiences of ill treatment. However, the authors pointed out that \nqualitative data provided by the parents indicated that professional and other kinds of social supports \nare carefully chosen for their anticipated “lesbian-friendly” credentials, and that lesbian parents are \nparticularly reliant on other lesbian parents for support. Mikhailovich et al. (2001) also found that lesbian \nand gay parents reported largely positive experiences of their interactions with the health care system. \nAlthough a quarter of the 92 parents they surveyed had experienced some discrimination, usually in the \nform of inappropriate or invasive questioning about their familial or relationship circumstances, most \nof their concerns related to problems that had nothing to do with parental sexual orientation (e.g., long \nwaiting times and effective treatment of chronic health conditions).\nLesbian, gay or bisexual foster families may contend with discriminatory practices among social workers \nthat mean they are not given due consideration as suitable carers (Hicks, 2006; Riggs, 2007, 2011). \nRiggs (2011) noted that few foster care agencies have policies to guide working with LGBT families. \nHicks (2000) indicated that gay and lesbian foster parents in the UK, more often than their heterosexual \ncounterparts, have disabled children placed in their care or children who are hard to place for other \nkinds of behavioural reasons. Although Riggs (2007, 2011) has found no comparable evidence of such \npractices in Australia, he concurs that Australian lesbian and gay foster parents may be treated as carers \nof “last resort”. In his qualitative study of the experiences of foster families in four Australian states, \nRiggs (2011) found that many gay men and lesbians believed they were treated with some degree of \n“justifiable suspicion” by agencies, and were often reliant on the goodwill of individual social workers \nrather than a policy framework that encouraged their participation. Riggs (2007) also found evidence that \nsocial workers’ assessment reports are approving of lesbian and gay couples who are not demonstrably \naffectionate with each other, indicating that their sexuality is only acceptable if it is rendered invisible.\nHow Australian schools respond to same-sex parented families has recently received research attention. \nMitchell and Ward (2010) noted that while there are many opportunities for Australian schools to lead \nsocial change in supporting family diversity, many do not effectively address issues facing same-sex \nattracted or gender diverse young people or same-sex parented families. Lindsay et al. (2006), in a \nqualitative study of the school experiences of 20 Victorian lesbian-parented families (in which children \nwere included in the family interviews), found that some children receive very strong messages in school \nenvironments that they should not discuss their family experiences in the classroom. This could include \nbeing silenced by teachers when they attempted to share information about events such as Pride March \nor their parents’ commitment ceremony. Although Lindsay and colleagues noted an increase in families \nwith same-sex parents in some areas is putting pressure on some primary schools to change these kinds \nof occurrences, both curriculum and pedagogy in primary schools remains strongly heteronormative \n(Mitchell & Ward, 2010). In other words, teaching materials and library books often give minimal coverage \nto any kind of family diversity or present a “sanitised” view of lesbian and gay parented families in which \nparental affection or sexuality is erased (see also Lovell & Riggs, 2009).\nIn common, researchers call for increased attention to teacher, social worker and medical practitioner \ntraining about family diversity, including the need for service providers to avoid making assumptions \nabout family relationships, and for inclusive language about gender and number of parents on relevant \ndocumentation. Health, community agency and education service providers, in order to better support \nLGBT parented families, need to encourage environments in which familial diversity is considered the \nnorm rather than the exception (Lindsay et al., 2006; Lovell & Riggs, 2009; Mitchell & Ward, 2010; McNair \net al., 2002, 2008; Rawsthorne, 2009; Riggs, 2011).\nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  19\nKey messages: Social support\n  Support from friends, families, same-sex parented family-friendly organisations and communities can assist \nin mediating potentially adverse affects of legal and other forms of discrimination.\n  Lesbian co-parenting couples and single parents appear to be receiving good support from medical and \nother kinds of health care providers but evidence suggests that this is at least in part because lesbian \nparents choose their health care providers very carefully.\n  Lesbian, gay or bisexual foster families may contend with discriminatory practices among social workers \nthat mean they are not given due consideration as suitable carers, or expected to hide open displays of \naffection in order to be considered suitable carers. Many foster care agencies do not have policies that \nsupport family diversity.\n  Although some school environments in areas with large numbers of lesbian or gay parents have developed \npractices supportive of family diversity, this is, at best, uneven. Some children receive very strong messages \nin school environments that they should not discuss their family experiences in the classroom. This could \ninclude being silenced by teachers when they attempted to share information about events such as Pride \nMarch or their parents’ commitment ceremony.\nConclusion\nThere are many ways in which same-sex parented families are similar to and different from conventional, \nheterosexual couple families. Although a two parent cohabiting couple often forms the basis of the \nfamily, same-sex parented families may also be based on three or four parent models, in which a \nknown sperm donor or co-parenting male couple will be engaged in non-resident care of the children. \nSame-sex parented families in Australia are often created through assisted reproductive technologies \nand foster care, yet a substantial number of children being raised by lesbian or gay parents, like many \nchildren raised by heterosexual couples, have experienced their parents divorce and were born in the \ncontext of prior heterosexual marriages. Although same-sex parented families to some extent challenge \nthe conventional idea that parents are biologically related to their children, with the exception of foster \nfamilies, it is usual for children to be biologically related to at least one of the parents, and adoption is \nrare due to legal and social constraints in Australia. Indications are also that same-sex parented families \nare more likely to challenge the inequitable divisions of paid and domestic labour known to characterise \ndual earner heterosexual nuclear families (ABS, 2013).\nAlthough numerous scholars now agree it is not possible to sustain a claim frequently made in the \nearlier literature that there are no differences between children raised in same-sex and heterosexual \nparented families (Amato, 2012; Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Biblarz & Stacey, 2010; Eggebeen, 2012; Goldberg, \n2010; Marks, 2012; Regnerus, 2012; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001), there is now strong evidence that same-sex \nparented families constitute supportive environments in which to raise children. Indeed, with regard to \nchildren raised from birth by lesbian couples clear benefits appear to exist with regard to: the quality \nof parenting children experience in comparison to their peers parented in heterosexual couple families; \nchildren’s and young adults’ greater tolerance of sexual and gender diversity; and gender flexibility \ndisplayed by children, particularly sons.\nBiblarz and Stacey (2010) commented that the benefits regarding parenting quality that children of lesbian \nparents appear to experience could well be due to the “double dose” of “feminine” parenting. Just as \nheterosexual mothers usually have greater care-giving responsibilities and display greater parenting skill \nthan heterosexual fathers (e.g., Craig, 2006), lesbian mothers appear to bring this gendered tendency \nto their parenting relationships. Additionally, lesbian mothers are likely to be highly motivated parents \ngiven the lengths many need to go to conceive children, and they may also be conscious that their \nparenting practices are under scrutiny due to social disapproval. It is also possible that same-sex parents \nare especially attentive to the quality of their parenting as a way of counteracting the ill effects of \nprejudice and discrimination their children may experience. More needs to be known about whether \n20  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nCHILD FAMILY COMMUNITY AUSTRALIA\nchildren raised in planned lesbian parent families are more likely to experience parental separation. \nHowever, if this does hold true, it could well be linked to the relative lack of institutional support for \nsame-sex relationships, rather than any inherent instability to which relationships between two women \nare prone. In many jurisdictions, including Australia, same-sex couples are still not permitted to marry, \nand it remains to be seen how more widespread marriage rights could influence this relational stability \nfinding.\nWhere differences that could be construed as disadvantageous to children have been detected between \nsamples of same-sex parented families and heterosexual couple families these need to be kept in \nperspective. With regard to the one large study thus far that has detected harms to children raised \nin same-sex parented families, the fact that the analysis does not take into account the children’s \nexperience of their parents’ separation and divorce is a serious methodological flaw. In commenting on \nthe legislative and policy implications of the recent Regnerus study in the US, Paul Amato (2012), a very \nwell-respected US-based family scholar, warns against deriving legal or policy implications from these \nostensibly negative research findings about same-sex parents and their children:\nIt would be unfortunate if the findings from the Regnerus study were used to undermine the \nsocial progress that has been made in recent decades in protecting the rights of gays, lesbians \nand their children … Most of the young adults with gay or lesbian parents in the New Family \nStructures Survey also experienced divorce as children. Consequently, it is likely that many of \nthe disadvantages reported by these offspring were due to … the failed heterosexual marriages \nof parents rather than the sexual orientations of parents. (p. 773)\nLaw- and policy-makers in Australia have already made use of the considerable research evidence that \ndemonstrates children in planned lesbian parent families do as well psychologically and sometimes \nbetter than children in heterosexual parented families. For example, findings from earlier reviews of this \nbody of literature were taken into account in recommending extending the eligibility criteria for access \nto clinical donor insemination to lesbian couples in the State of Victoria, in addition to amending the \nStatus of Children Act to make children’s parentage clearer in cases where lesbian couples use donor \ninsemination to conceive (see Victorian Law Reform Commission, 2007). A remaining area of state and \nterritory based legal inequity involves access to adoption rights for same-sex couples.\nAlthough many Australian same-sex parented families are currently receiving good support from their \nhealth care providers, more could be done in the social policy arena to develop supportive service \nsystems. One very positive finding emerging from this overview of the research is that same-sex parented \nfamilies often do not experience the sexuality-based abuse or discrimination they fear. However, the \nreported levels of concern about discrimination, teasing or bullying by parents and children in the \nschool setting do indicate that a generalised stigma associated with societal prejudice against same-sex \nrelationships forms a backdrop to all same-sex parenting. Health care providers, the education system, \nthe child protection system and other family service systems clearly have work to do in being fully aware \nof the diverse family forms in Australia and supporting and providing appropriate services to meet their \nneeds. A set of guidelines were recently developed by the Bouverie Centre, La Trobe University, in \nconjunction with VicHealth, to assist service providers in community, hospital and counselling settings in \nVictoria to provide inclusive and sensitive care to same-sex attracted parents and their children, and to \nprospective same-sex attracted parents.6 More initiatives of this kind in other states and territories would \nensure responsive and inclusive service provision to same-sex parented families.\nTo date, little research has been published on transgender or bisexual parented families, the experiences \nof children growing up with transgender or bisexual parents, or planned gay father families. More \nresearch into family structures and processes among these groups is needed, both in Australia and \ninternationally. Additionally, given the evidence that children’s wellbeing in same-sex parented families \nvaries cross-culturally, a body of Australian quantitative data on the wellbeing of same-sex parented \nchildren and families would be welcome as a means of monitoring how Australian families are faring in \nglobal perspective. It is also important to avoid the assumption that it is only comparative, quantitative \nresearch that enables learning about the wellbeing or other characteristics of children in same-sex \n6 Guidelines for Health Care Providers Working With Same-Sex Parented Families is available via VicHealth <www.vichealth.vic.gov.au/Publications/Health-Inequalities/\nGuidelines-for-Health-care-Providers-working-with-Same-Sex-Parented-Families.aspx> \nSame-sex parented families in Australia  |  21\nparented families (see Biblarz & Savci, 2010; Goldberg, 2007, 2010; Hicks, 2005; Stacey & Biblarz, 2001). \nAs scholars such as Goldberg (2010) advocate, it is important to “study complex families in context” \nthrough qualitative research, and indeed over time, in order to learn more about how parental gender \nand sexuality interact in specific relational settings.\nReferences\nNote: To assist the reader to identify which references may be most relevant to an Australian context, the references marked with \nan asterisk (*) indicate that the research was conducted in Australia or New Zealand. \n* Australian Bureau of Statistics.

    "abstract": "This paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on same-sex parented families.\n\n\nIntroduction: This research paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on same-sex parented families. It includes discussion of the different modes of conception or family formation, different family structures, and the small number of studies on bisexual and transgender parents. Particular attention is paid to research on the emotional, social and educational outcomes for children raised by lesbian and gay parents, and the methodological strengths and weaknesses of this body of work.\n\nKey Messages:\n\nAbout 11% of Australian gay men and 33% of lesbians have children. Children may have been\nconceived in the context of previous heterosexual relationships, or raised from birth by a co-parenting\ngay or lesbian couple or single parent.\n\nOverall, research to date considerably challenges the point of view that same-sex parented families\nare harmful to children. Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as\ntheir peers from heterosexual couple families.\n\nSome researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they\nexperience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughter\ndisplay more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity.\n\nThe possible effect of important socio-economic family factors, such as income and parental education,\nwere not always considered in the studies reviewed in this paper.\n\nAlthough many Australian lesbian-parented families appear to be receiving good support from their\nhealth care providers, there is evidence that more could be done to develop policies and practices\nsupportive of same-sex parented families in the Australian health, education, child protection and\nfoster care systems.\n\nAdditional key messages, relating to specific family structures and psychosocial outcomes for children\nraised by lesbian and gay parents, are included throughout the paper",
