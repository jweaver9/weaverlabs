Fung said the \nmound of donated clothes \nrepresented the overfl ow \nof landfi lls. \nTh ough the primary goal \nof this exhibition is to inform \nviewers about fast fashion, \nFung also wants to provide \nclothes for attendees.  \nFrom 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., \nall clothes donated to “Fast \nFashion” will be free for \nparticipants to take home.\nFung said he wants \neveryone at the exhibit to \nknow they can take the \nclothes home  regardless \nof their status at SJSU. \n“Th e clothes are open to \nany students . . . it can be \nfaculty too,” Fung said. “It \ncould be anyone that sees \nsomething they like in this \nhuge pile of clothes that \nsymbolizes the landfi ll or \nthey see something on the \nrack - take the hanger, and \nthe garments, and it’s yours.”\n“Fast Fashion” also \nincludes representations of \nslow fashion and its pro-\ncesses through photographs \nmade by Fung’s beginning \nphotography class.\nSlow fashion is a term \nused to describe the sus-\ntainable process of creat-\ning clothing of high quality \nand longevity. \n“Th ere is huge power and \nimpact intersecting social \njustice and art, you can use \nart to bring change, to bring \nawareness, to educate, and \nthis was case proven with my \nstudents that created beauti-\nful triptychs of slow fashion \nas a visual response to fast \nfashion about sustainability, \nabout good craft smanship, \nyou know, about awareness,” \nFung said.\nMarley Gerhart, a \nNotre Dame High School \nstudent who Fung men-\ntored, displayed her slow \nfashion photography along-\nside Fung’s beginning \nphotography class. \nHer photographs tell the \nstory of how slow fashion \nbenefi ts the environment, \nthe people who create the \nclothing and ultimately \nthe consumer. \n“Th e thread is set against \nthe plants to kind of show \nthe environmental benefi ts \nof using ethically sourced \nmaterials that is used in \nslow fashion,” Gerhart said. \nShe said participating in \nthe exhibition has opened \nher eyes again about why \nfast fashion is harmful to the \nenvironment and the people \nthat help manufacture it. \n“Th ere are a lot of factors \nthat make slow fashion the \nbetter choice regardless of \nthe time that it takes to man-\nufacture,” Gerhart said.\nHer family taught her \nhow to sew and design her \nown clothes at a young age \nwhich led her to be inter-\nested in “ethically sourced \nclothing.” \nthe increase of food pricing and stated, \n“In 2018, retail food-at-home prices \nrose 0.4%.”\nThe price of eggs saw a 10.8% increase \nin 2018 making an important source of \nprotein harder to obtain.\nSome might argue a 0.4% increase \ndoes not mean a whole lot, but just \na slight change makes cheaper and \nunhealthier foods seem more appealing.\nAccording to 2018 research by \nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill and Rutgers Cancer Institute of New \nJersey, “Evidence strongly suggests that \nexcess food consumption is a primary \ncause of rising rates of obesity.”\nHighly processed energy-dense \nfoods are cheaper, which leads to \nincreased rates of obesity and likely to \n“socio-economic disparities in health,” \nthe research stated.\nIf it is faster and cheaper to grab an \nunhealthy meal, then it’s impossible to \nresist, especially if you are working with \na tight budget.\nThe issue with the trend is it is such \na small incline in price differential \nthat many people will still say eating \nhealthy is a choice that a 0.4% increase \nshould not affect, but prices add \nup quickly.\nAccording to a study published by the \nHarvard School of Public Health, eating \na healthy diet will cost you $1.50 more \neach day.\nOnce again, this number might \nappear minuscule, but $1.50 a day for a \nminimum wage worker is a lot in \nthe big picture.\nThe daily $1.50 per day slowly \nbecomes $30.50 a month and eventually \naround $11,130 more spent a year \njust to eat healthier. \nTempting fast food and fatty cheap \ngoods are produced with too small a \nprice tag to keep anyone struggling \nfinancially away from purchasing the \ngoods.\nUntil healthy foods can be distributed \nas easily as high carb foods, the fault \nshould not be put on those who cannot \nafford better.\nArt exposes excessive waste in fashion\nBy Johanna Martin\nCONTRIBUTING WRITER\nCOSTS\nContinued from page 1\nFollow Chris on Twitter\n@ChrisCore24ILLUSTRATION BY CINDY CUELLAR\nJOHANNA MARTIN | CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER\nCivil engineering alumnus Yosef Gebre adjusts his art, which is displayed at the “Fast Fashion” exhibition Tuesday.\nTh e exhibition also in-\ncluded clothes and art made \nby civil engineering alumnus \nYosef Gebre.\nGebre’s art pieces consist \nof the “upcycling of clothes \nand hand painting clothes in \nfull collections.”\nHis upcycling process \nconsists of hand sewing \npieces of diff erent articles \nof clothing and then hand \npainting illustrations on the \nsewn pieces. \n“My vision was just to fi ll \nin a void that I saw in cloth-\ning and I just wanted to make \nreally powerful statement \npieces,” Gebre said. “I like to \nthink of each piece as more as \na study.”\nGebre is preparing for \na runway show later this \nweek where he will use \nsome of his pieces displayed \nin “Fast Fashion.”\n“It’s my fi rst collection, \nso moving forward I defi -\nnitely want to work on how \nsustainable each piece is,” \nGebre said.\nFung also said curating \nthis exhibition has changed \nhim and his views on fashion. \n“I need to know where it’s \nbeing made.

I went to mostly primary Mexican schools \nand it was shocking and scary to see many Trump \nsupporters in one setting.” \n“It was kind of hard going from attending a school \nwhere people had similar experience and shared the \nsame value, to a school that people did not understand \nthe fear just existing and being called a criminal when \nyou are just trying to live your life,” Lopez said. \nEven though they were not adults when Trump was \nelected, one student said she still feels the social change \nthat was caused by the Trump administration. \n“Where I lived, some of them [my classmates] felt \nlike their own community was against them,” political \nscience sophomore Ashley Guerrero said. “They had no \nsafe space.”\nGuerrero said that the possibility of Trump getting \nreelected does not seem realistic to her because of his \nactions in his current term. \n“We have already seen [Trump] being corrupt and \ntrying to overpower other branches in the government,” \nGuerrero said. “Why would we let this happen again?”\nDonald Trump promised to \nstrengthen the U.S. military and to bring \nthe troops home during his presidential \ncampaign.\nConnor Quinn, a health science \ngraduate student, served as a combat \nmedic in the Army for nine years, \nduring the presidencies of both George \nW. Bush and Barack Obama.\nQuinn said he felt more troops have \nbeen rotated back to the U.S. since \nTrump’s time in office, believing conflicts \nhave died down on a large scale.\nOverall, Quinn felt that Presidents \nGeorge W. Bush and Obama did a better \njob of handling issues domestically \nwhile it’s been Trump who has done a \nbetter job of resolving issues overseas.\nWhile Quinn admitted there is a \nchance that some of the things Trump \nenacted abroad could lead to conflict \ndown the road, he praised Trump’s \nactions.\n“I don’t think a President \nof the United States ever crossed \nover into North Korea,” Quinn said, \nrecognizing the fact that Trump was the \nfirst U.S. president to set foot on North \nKorean soil.\nQuinn is referring to this past June \nwhen Trump briefly crossed over into \nthe North Korean border and had an \ninteraction with Kim Jung Un.\nWhile some praised Trump’s \nimpact on the military during his \ntime in office, others said they felt \nthe military has been weakened \nfollowing his election.\n“[He’s] encouraged more people to \nenlist and get away with a lot,” marketing \nsenior Hannah Moreo said.\nMoreo, who served in the Air \nForce for four years, spoke of the \ncultural change following the election \nof Trump.\n“I know he’s changed the requirements \nwith gender reassignment,” Moreo said.\nIn 2019, the U.S. Department of \nDefense changed the policy regarding \ntransgender service members in \nthe U.S. military. \nNew policies state that transgender \nmilitary members may serve but they \nmust do so under their biological sex.\nIn terms of overseas conflict, \nMoreo does not think the military \nfared any better.\n“[He] changed foreign military \nrelations, weakened our allies,” she said.\nFor civil engineering senior Ricardo \nTorres, Trump’s presidency has been \na mix of good and bad with no huge \nimpact on the military either way.\nHaving served in the Navy for \n12 years, Torres said the transition \nfrom Obama to Trump was unlike \nany transition between presidents \nin the past.\n“That’s when things got difficult in \nthe workspace, people didn’t like talking \nabout politics as much,” Torres said. He \ncompared openly talking about Trump \nto “walking on glass.”\nA noticeable benefit Torres \nsaid he saw that followed Trump’s \nelection was the greater care for \nmilitary veterans.\nOne such example comes from the VA \nMission Act, passed under the Trump \nadministration, which aims to give \nveterans a greater array of treatments \nthrough the healthcare system. \nIn Torres’ eyes there is no president \ncapable of weakening the U.S. military.\nOne thing that Torres felt has \nchanged overseas since Trump was \nelected was the withdrawal of troops \nfrom Syria and said that it “hurt the \nhearts and minds.”\nPresident Donald Trump has been \nheavily criticized for his anti-LGBTQ+ \nrhetoric and behavior ever since he took \noffice.\n“Overall I think that this presidency \nhas been a disaster for the LGBTQ+ \npeople,” biochemistry junior Murphy \nGuidice-Murphy said. “It’s more a battle \nof how much can we stabilize and keep it \nas together as we were until we actually \nhave someone in office that produces \nsome kind of progression.”\nIn September, the U.S. Department \nof Education removed “sexual \norientation” and “gender identity” as \nterms to track in bullying data for the \nagency. It eliminated any tracking that \nwould be used to report anti-LGBTQ+ \nbullying or discrimination, according to \nGLAAD. \nIn October, the Trump administration \nannounced support for allowing faith-\nbased schools to use religion as a “right \nto discriminate” against LGBTQ+ \nteachers and staff and subsequently \nremoved pro-LGBTQ+ curriculum.\nBehavioral science junior Lori Paris \nsaid that while she’s lucky to have faced \nno outright discrimination in San \nJose, having a president like Trump \nwho engages in anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric \nshows the public it’s OK to think that \nway. \n“Its sucks because [with] him being so \nout there and definitely not diplomatic, \n[he] has encouraged people who have \nthe same thoughts, who maybe were \nnot vocalizing it as often, they’re out \nthere voicing it more,” Paris said. \nParis, who recently came out as \nLGBTQ+ and grew up in a Catholic \nfamily, said that politicians will produce \npolicy that parallels their own standards \nand ideals, even if American ideals \npreach separation of church and state.\nSome within the \nLGBTQ+ community are still \nfearful of discrimination and \ntheir fear is often incited by \nPresident Trump. \n“Trump is actually actively trying to \nerase trans and intersex people which \nis just really awful,” computer science \nsenior Vai Eldridge said. \nEldridge, who identifies as \ntransgender, said that erasing the \nidentities of these individuals can have \ndisastrous results including high rates of \nsocietal problems like domestic issues, \nself harm, suicide and depression. \nGuidice-Murphy said he is fearful of \nnew changes to application forms by the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices.\nHe said he is afraid that some of the \nchanges that would require applicants to \nmark their sexual orientation will allow \nfor discrimination against the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. \n“So if you put, ‘Hi, I’m a gay \nmale seeking treatment for HIV,’ or, \n‘I’m someone that’s questioning my \ngender and I may want to actually be \ntransitioning later on,’ those health \nand service programs that are typically \nprovided, no matter what based on your \nincome, becomes, ‘Oh, we can actually \ntake this into account and reject your \napplication based on those things,’ ” \nGuidice-Murphy said. \nResearch from the Center for \nAmerican Progress found that \na significant gap in pay for gay and \ntransgender Americans can also lead \nthese individuals to rely more on public \nservices.\nIts meta-analysis compiled in 2013 \nshows that these studies suggest that gay \nand bisexual men earned between 11% \nand 27% less than their heterosexual \ncounterparts. \n“The average household income for \nsame-sex couples raising children is \n$15,500, or 20% less than heterosexual \ncouples,” the Center for American \nProgress said.

He then decided \nto run on a grassroots \nplatform for governor \nof Indiana.\nThe majority of his \nplatform was that he would \ncut taxes for the state and \nonce elected, that’s exactly \nwhat he did.\nAccording to CNBC, \nthe tax cuts Pence passed \nwere the largest in Indiana \nhistory, containing “a \n$3.5 billion package that \nslashed state income taxes, \nlowered the corporate \nrate and eliminated the \ninheritance tax.”\nThe Indy Star \nreported that the tax \ncuts were followed by \nthe unemployment \nrate dropping by 3.5% \nin Indiana.\nAside from major tax \ncuts, Pence has been a \nsurprising advocate for a \nfree press.\nAccording to The \nWashington Post, during \nhis time in Congress, \nPence co-signed legislation \nfor federal shield \nlaws that would allow \nreporters to keep sources \nanonymous against \ngovernment requests.\nThis is in vast contrast to \nthe Trump administration \nwhich has been aggressive \nin attacking the free press. \nTax cuts and free speech \nare things that Democrats \nmight agree with, but \nPence has plenty to his \nrecord that would leave \n“Never Trumpers” reeling \nif he took office.\nAccording to TIME \nMagazine, in 2006 Pence \nsaid that same-sex \nmarriage would bring a \n“societal collapse” if ever \nmade legal.\nThis was not the \nfirst time Pence had \nfaced controversy for \nhomophobic comments, \nwith a history of these type \nof statements starting back \nin 2000.\nAccording to The \nNew York Times, an \narchived version of \nPence’s original campaign \nwebsite had a statement \nthat attacked the Ryan \nWhite Care Act, which \ngives federal funding to \nHIV/AIDS patients.\nThe statement from the \nwebsite said, “Congress \nshould support the \nreauthorization of the Ryan \nWhite Care Act only after \ncompletion of an audit to \nensure that federal dollars \nwere no longer being \ngiven to organizations that \ncelebrate and encourage \nthe types of behaviors that \nfacilitate the spreading of \nthe HIV virus. Resources \nshould be directed toward \nthose institutions which \nprovide assistance to those \nseeking to change their \nsexual behavior.”\nPence continued his \nscuffle with treating HIV/\nAIDS patients in 2017 \nwhen a piece of legislation \nwas voted on in the \nHouse of Representatives \nto defund Planned \nParenthood.\nPence told a Vox \nreporter, “If Planned \nParenthood wants to be \ninvolved in providing \ncounseling services and \nHIV testing, they ought \nnot be in the business of \nproviding abortions. As \nlong as they aspire to do \nthat, I’ll be after them.”\nAside from his \ndisapproval of same-sex \nmarriage and Planned \nParenthood, Pence also \nreceived backlash in 2015 \nfor signing Indiana’s \nReligious Freedom \nRestoration Act, allowing \nbusinesses to refuse service \non the basis of religion \nwith impunity from local \ngovernment.\nAccording to CNN, \nthe act was later \nupdated and signed \nby Pence, prohibiting \nthe discrimination of \nsexual orientation.\nThe step back to \nensure that the LGBTQ \ncommunity would not \nbe affected is great in \ntheory, but it didn’t change \nthe fact it oppressed \npeople using their \nreligious beliefs.\nWith this resume \nbacking him, it is \ninteresting that Democrats \nare so eager to have Trump \nremoved and replaced \nwith Pence.\nThis was \nnot the fi rst \ntime Pence \nhad faced \ncontroversy \nfor \nhomophobic \ncomments, \nwith a history \nof these type \nof statements \nstarting back \nin 2000.\nANALYSIS\nImpeachment is a big deal. And if you try to \nimpeach the president, you’ll quite literally break \nthe news.\nIt’s no surprise that all of the major TV networks \ndecided to replace their normal programming \nwith the House of Representatives’ hearings on an \nimpeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump’s \ndealings with Ukraine.\nMost Americans haven’t seriously thought about \nimpeachment since former President Bill Clinton was \nimpeached in 1998 – and that’s a problem.\nImpeachment and removal from office is the final \ntool that Congress can use to hold the president \naccountable to the law. But because every president \nknows that a two-thirds Senate vote to remove a \npresident from office is nearly impossible, any claim \nof “No one is above the law” is moot.\nThe solution: use impeachment every time it’s \nsupposed to be used, whenever the president has \nbroken the law. Yes, that means former Presidents \nBarack Obama and George W. Bush should have been \nimpeached and removed from office, too.\nDuring September 2011, the Obama administration \nordered and carried out a fatal drone strike against \nAmerican-born Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen who \nthey claimed was involved in planning operations for \nal-Qaeda, according to The New York Times.\nThe killing of al-Awlaki undoubtedly violated his \nconstitutional right to due process, guaranteed by the \nFifth and 14th Amendments.\nIn 2014, when the Obama administration was \nforced to hand over an internal memo that justified \ndepriving al-Awlaki of his due process rights, a lawyer \nfor the American Civil Liberties Union described the \nmemo as “disturbing.”\n“[The memo is] ultimately an argument that the \npresident can order targeted killings of Americans \nwithout ever having to account to anyone outside the \nexecutive branch,” ACLU lawyer Jameel Jaffer said to \nthe Los Angeles Times.\nFor those actions alone, President Obama should \nhave been impeached and removed from office.\nFormer President George W. Bush on the other \nhand actually did see articles of impeachment drafted \nagainst him, but with no real consequences. After \n35 articles were written by Democratic Rep. Dennis \nKucinich, the House voted to refer the issue to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which did nothing \nabout it.\nSome of the articles concerned the Bush \nadministration’s use of torture on prisoners. CNN \nreported that Bush apologized for the American \nsoldiers who tortured Iraqi prisoners. \nHowever, Bush never revoked the Department of \nJustice memos that authorized the torture in the first \nplace, effectively making him complicit in the \nentire ordeal.\nAnother article alleged that under Bush’s watch, the \nNational Security Agency engaged in overbroad and \nunlawful data collection. In April 2019, The New York \nTimes reported that the NSA admitted it had violated \nU.S. law when it over collected data about Americans.\nIt’s no surprise that it came to light after the end of \nBush’s presidency in 2009, when impeachment was no \nlonger a threat.\nAnd that’s exactly what impeachment should be \n– a threat to all presidents that if they choose not \nto follow the law, the American people, through \nCongress, will hold them accountable by removing \nthem from office.\nOne would hope that if the impeachment process \nhad real weight behind it, our last two presidents \nwouldn’t have dared to break the law in the first place.\nIn “Federalist No. 69” from 1788, founding father \nAlexander Hamilton explained that the impeachment \nprocess was one of the precautions taken that \ndistinguished a president from a monarch.\n“The person of the king of Great Britain is sacred \nand inviolable; there is no constitutional tribunal to \nwhich he is amenable; no punishment to which he can \nbe subjected without involving the crisis of a national \nrevolution,” Hamilton wrote.\nAnd yet here we are, in the midst of what feels like \na crisis of a national revolution. We absolutely need a \nreal impeachment process, if only to ensure that our \npresident is not a king.\nPH\nO\nTO\n IL\nLU\nST\nRA\nTI\nO\nN \nBY\n C\nHE\nLS\nEA\n N\nG\nUY\nEN\n F\nLE\nIG\nE \nAN\nD \nED\nUA\nRD\nO\n T\nEI\nXE\nIR\nA\nOne would hope that if the \nimpeachment process had real \nweight behind it, our last two \npresidents wouldn’t have dared \nto break the law in the \nfi rst place.\nPence isn’t the president Democrats want\nKunal Mehta\nEXECUTIVE EDITOR\nSE\nA \nNG\nUY\nEN\n F\nLE\nIG\nE \nAN\nD \nED\nUA\nRD\nO\n T\nEI\nXE\nIR\nA\nGeorge W.

Trump\nCOLUMN\nJohnny Khamis was the first Arab American \nto take office in the city of San Jose.\n“It kind of signals success and assimilation \ninto a community when one of the members \nof the community has succeeded in running \nfor political office,” he said.\nJohnny Khamis was a financial \nadvisor for 19 years and he believed \nSan Jose mismanaged its money \nbefore he ran for office. The councilmember \nsaw libraries and parks in San Jose close and \npolice layoffs reduce officers on the streets.\n“These people don’t know how to manage \nmoney,” Johnny Khamis said.\nThe councilmember said he is proud of \nthe money he has been able to save the city \nthus far.\n“A lot of it is minutiae . . . We were saving a \nmillion dollars a year on a lease for the police \nacademy because we moved it into an empty \nbuilding that was brand new,” he said.\nJohnny Khamis now has his political \nprowess set on a state senate seat, but he will \nhave to do so without the aid of a political \nparty.\nHe is now an independent after leaving the \nRepublican Party in 2018 because of President \nDonald Trump’s family separation policy, \nwhich allowed federal authorities to separate \nparents and children who attempted to enter \nthe U.S.\n“When I first heard my dad considering \nleaving the Republican Party, I was against the \nidea because even though you are Republican, \nyou do not have to like the actions of President \nTrump,” Constantin Khamis said. “However, \nI now believe he made the right decision \nbecause now that he is out . . . he is free to \nexpress his own opinions.”\nThat policy was the last straw for Johnny \nKhamis, who said that he had been considering \nleaving the party ever since Trump was elected.\n“I’m not going to change my political points \nof view, but I will just not be tied down to \nwhoever is in office and what their viewpoints \nare,” Johnny Khamis said. “I don’t care if it’s \nDemocrat or Republican, I want to be known \nfor my own viewpoints and not what a party \ntells me to say.”\nHaving a no party preference has upsides \nand downsides when running for office, \nhowever.\n“There’s a big con. Parties are cash machines, \nso I don’t have access to a cash machine,” he \nsaid.\nDespite this, Johnny Khamis said he and his \ncampaign have raised $360,000 so far. It’s less \nmoney than some of his opponents, but he \nenjoys the freedom of being an independent.\n“What is different, being without a party \nis I have the freedom to say what I want to \nsay, without necessarily caring about who \nI’m going to offend at the party director level, \nwhich is something that none of my opponents \ncould say,” he said.\nEnrique Navarro-Donnellan, SJSU political \nscience alumnus, recently started working on \nJohnny Khamis’s campaign team again as \nan executive assistant after a previous stint \nbetween 2014-2016.\nNavarro-Donnellan said that working in \nthe office can be a double-edged sword, but \nhe’s enjoying the experience. \n“If the elected official is to lose their race, \nthe staff loses their jobs. But at the same time \nthe exposure we get . . . is immense,” Navarro-\nDonnellan said. “There’s a lot of reward to get \nfrom all the experiences.”\nJohnny Khamis leads in the polls in the \nDistrict 15 Senate race according to an \nOctober San Jose Spotlight article.\nThe 2020 California State Senate primary \nwill be held March 3, 2020.\nThe Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict.”\nIn the book, Chenoweth said in the last 10 years there have \nbeen more mass demonstrations calling for the removal of \npolitical leaders than in any decade since 1900.\nBut in the U.S., especially under the Trump administration, \nthere have been several key protest movements that have either \nworked or not worked. The 2019 Women’s March was one of \nthose protests without a centralized policy goal.\nArmaline dove into the subject and said the organizers \nfor the Women’s March didn’t effectively plan to build a \nbroad-based movement where protesters could build political \nleverage.\n“They didn’t think very much or very hard about it as an \norganizing activity,” Armaline said. He added that the only way \nmarches like this are effective is if the organizers use strategies \nto build and exercise power.\n“The more effective resistance strategies don’t just have \nsymbols,” he said. “They build power and with every step, they \nmove forward, [and] they build upon the previous. They seek \nto actually address change.”\nJackson said that even though the Women’s March raised \nawareness, if organizers outlined policy changes they wanted to \nsee, then the protest would have been more effective. \n“They’re just saying this is a really important issue that we \nneed to be paying more attention to,” Jackson said.\nBiomedical engineering junior Arturo Chavez, said \nprotesting and rallying at a local level is important for \ndemocracy and can be effective. Chavez is the chair of Student \nAdvocates for Higher Education at SJSU, which promotes \n“higher education among immigrant students regardless of \nlegal status.”\n“Protesting gives a voice to a group of people to collectively \nvoice their grievances and raise awareness to issues they care \nabout,” Chavez said.\nOne of the examples in the organization’s advocacy work \nover the summer was when the Santa Clara County Board of \nSupervisors voted against a policy preventing law enforcement \nfrom cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officials.\nThe law was following the brutal stabbing of Bambi Larson, \na woman who was killed by an undocumented immigrant in \nher home.\nChavez said the advocates took part in the protests and \nmarches happening over the summer relating to that push to \nshut down the policy change, which the board ended up not \nchanging in the end.\n“[There’s] this goofball notion that rebellions following \nthe murder of people by police officers somehow don’t go \nanywhere and don’t work, and that’s complete bullshit,” Chavez \nsaid.\nHe added that specifically in cases such as the shooting of \nTrayvon Martin in 2012 brought more people to rebel and \ndemand for justice.\n“Empirically speaking, when you look at almost every \nsingle case of note since 2010 . . . it is only after there is public \nrebellion that there is any action by the state to do anything \nabout those cases,” Armaline said.\nELECTION ACTIVISMsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 20196\nSJSU alumnus seeks seat in state Senate\nBorn in Beirut, Lebanon, an 8-year-old \nJohnny Khamis and his family hid in bomb \nshelters in order to stay safe during the \nLebanese Civil War.\nHis father was taken away for questioning \ntwo times. After the second time, his family \ndecided that it was best to leave.\n“We left everything, we took whatever cash \nwas on hand,” Khamis said. “My dad didn’t \neven go to the bank, he just left all of his money \nat the bank and we fled across the border \ninto Syria and we waited for political asylum \npaperwork.”\nNow 51, the San Jose State alumnus is a \nSan Jose City Councilmember representing \nDistrict 10 and a candidate for a state Senate \nseat.\n“I think my dad taking the senate seat for \nDistrict 15 would [be] a huge achievement for \nour family and the immigrant community,” \nConstantin Khamis, Johnny’s son and \ncomputer science freshman, said. “The \nimmense progress we have made from our \nhumble beginnings is not only inspiring to \nme, but also is a defining principle [of] how \nempowering America is.”\nAs he grew up, Johnny Khamis said he \nnever thought of pursuing a career in politics. \nHe graduated from SJSU in 1991 with a degree \nin business management.\nIt wasn’t until the aftermath of 9/11 that \nKhamis decided to become more involved in \npolitics.\n“I got a lot more involved in politics as \nan Arab American because I didn’t want the \nArab American community to feel hatred,” \nJohnny Khamis said. “None of us condone \nwhat happened on 9/11 so I began kind of \norganizing the Arabic community locally here \nand then statewide.”\nWhen he was elected to the council in 2012, \nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n@BrendanCross93\nProtesters need clear mission\nCivil resistance and civil disobedience demonstrate the \npeople’s opposition to a government’s policies, actions or the \ngovernment itself.\nBut the only way any actual change can come from both \nforms of protesting is if protesters and activists are specific in \nthe policy changes and goals behind their social movements.\nResistance and disobedience should be clearly distinct.\nCivil resistance is a broad term, encompassing nonviolent \nactions that demonstrate opposition to a policy, law or \ngovernment. \nIt is not as easy as holding symbolic protests.\n“The more specific your policy goal is, the more likely you \nare to see change on that issue,” Melinda Jackson, political \nscience chair and professor, said.\nHistorically speaking, both civil resistance and civil \ndisobedience are embedded in influencing the United States \ngovernment by opposing laws, political policies and actions that \nwere racist or unpopular.\nAn example of a symbolic protest was at the 1968 Mexico \nCity Olympic Games where San Jose State student-athletes \nTommie Smith and John Carlos raised their black-gloved fists. \nIt was a silent protest of the treatment of Black Americans \nand the poverty that affected communities predominantly \nmade up of people of color. Their protest aimed to raise \nawareness without necessarily breaking the law.\n“They were certainly effective in that moment,” Jackson said.\nIn the short term, she said, calling attention to those issues \nwas a valuable political action and significantly altered the \ncourse of the civil rights movement.\n“I actually love to use their protest as an example of what we \ncall symbolic speech when we talk about the First Amendment,” \nJackson said. “Standing on the podium with their fists raised, \nthey didn’t say a single word, but they communicated a really \nstrong message right through symbolic speech.”\nBut civil disobedience is by no means the same as resistance. \nRather it is the act of intentionally breaking the law to protest. \nCivil disobedience is a refusal to cooperate with unjust laws, \npolicies or government demands. You are not only breaking the \nlaw, you are doing so intentionally, as an act of protest. \n“I’m not doing [civil disobedience] to make all these other \npoints or to achieve some end in the moment,” William \nArmaline, justices studies professor and SJSU Human Rights \nProgram director, said.\nHe added, “What I’m doing is I’m making a statement about \na particular law by saying I am going to, in a very civil way, \nsimply disobey this law because it is unjust.”\nArmaline referred to the civil rights movement when young \nAfrican American protesters sat at segregated lunch counters \nand refused to move. They directly violated the Jim Crow laws \nof the South to demonstrate that unjust laws would not be \naccepted.\nJackson similarly said that protests against the Vietnam War \npushed the government to bring troops back to the United \nStates. But when social justice movements don’t have that \ncentralized focus, the problem arises, she said. \n Civil resistance and disobedience have erupted around the \nworld in recent years.\n“There has been in this decade a real rise in the use of mass \nprotests in particular as a way to address grievances against \ngovernments around the world,” Harvard professor Erica \nChenoweth, said in the book “Why Civil Resistance Works: \nBy Christian Trujano\nSTAFF WRITER\nFollow Christian on Twitter\n@ChristianTruja2\nMAURICIO LA PLANTE | SPARTAN DAILY ARCHIVES\nPublic health junior Cristian Hernandez Calderon (center) and photography senior Nanzi Muro (right) rally with dozens of \ndemonstrators in support of preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy by San Jose City Hall, Nov.  5.\nBRENDAN CROSS | SPARTAN DAILY\nSan Jose City Councilmember Johnny Khamis speaks at an SJSU forum Monday.\nBy Brendan Cross \nSTAFF WRITER\nANALYSIS\n[There’s] this goofball notion that \nrebellions following the murder of \npeople by police offi cers somehow \ndon’t go anywhere and don’t work, and \nthat’s complete bullshit.\nArturo Chavez\nbiomedical engineering junior \nStudent Advocates for Higher Education chair\nSince former President Richard \nNixon 43 years before him, \nPresident Donald Trump is the first \npresident in decades to not release \nhis full tax returns.\nWhile serving as president, \nTrump continues to profit off of \nhis business endeavors, which is a \nmajor conflict of interest.\nWhen Trump claims he has a \nmassive amount of wealth, it seems \nonly reasonable that the American \npublic would want to see whether or \nnot he has avoided tax laws over \nthe years. \nAs more wealthy businesspeople \nfrom both major parties are \ndeciding to run for public office and \nin the upcoming 2020 presidential \nelections, it is only fair that \nAmericans will continue to demand \ncandidates release their tax returns.\nNixon was heavily scrutinized \nafter refusing to release his tax \nreturns for three years. \nAfter the Watergate scandal \nunfolded, the American people \nlearned Nixon had avoided paying \n$400,000 in taxes to the IRS. \nIn 1973 Th e Providence Journal-\nBulletin discovered a source that \nprovided evidence that Nixon had \npaid taxes of only $792.81 in 1970 and \n$878.03 in 1971, despite exceeding an \nincome of more than $400,000.\nAfter this was uncovered, Nixon \nfamously said, “People have got to \nknow whether or not their president \nis a crook. Well, I’m not a crook.” \nThis was proved otherwise after \nAmericans discovered his history of \ndodging taxes, among other crimes.\nSince then, every presidential \nnominee from 1980 to 2012 has \nreleased their tax returns, until Trump \njoined the presidential race in 2016. \nWhile this disclosure seems \nmandatory, the bipartisan tradition \nis purely voluntary. \nBut for Americans, it means more \nthan just numbers on a government \nform, it’s about transparency and truth. \nReleasing tax returns ensures the \npublic that the president is paying \ntheir fair share just like everyone else. \nWhen the public looks towards what \nkind of candidates they want to elect for \noffi  ce, there is a truthfulness that comes \nout of seeing where the money travels. \nTax returns contain important \ninformation like what candidates \nown and borrowed, charitable \ncontributions, what taxes they’ve \npaid (if any) and whether or not \nthey’ve taken advantage of tax \nloopholes or foreign bank accounts.  \nSeeing a full release of a \ncandidate’s returns not only gives \nAmericans clear information about \nthe credibility of their money, but it \ncan also indicate what kind of fiscal \npolicies they will pursue in office. \nIt can show whether there are confl icts \nof interest in their pursuit of public offi  ce \nor if there could be any entanglements \nwith other foreign businesses that will \nconsequently impact American politics. \nIn 2018, an investigative report \nfrom Th e New York Times found that \nTrump had accumulated a wealth of \nover $413 million in today’s dollars \nfrom his father’s inheritance, but \navoided paying taxes on it through \nloopholes and fi nancial agreements \naided by his personal lawyers.\nAs an American, this is clearly \nfraud to me.\nTrump has been credibly accused \nof engaging in criminal activity \nfor decades.\n“It’s undisputed that he is still \nprofi ting from his businesses,” Daniel \nShaviro, a New York University \nlaw professor, said to Vox. “Th e tax \nreturns may help provide information \nthat sheds light on his motives.” \nTrump’s only public tax return is from \n2005, which was nearly 15 years ago and \n11 years before he decided to run for \npresident in 2016. \nNo candidate up for election finds \nthis process enjoyable, but there is a \nlevel of truthfulness that it provides. \nAs Americans continue to elect \npoliticians who are nontraditional \nor come from various professional \nbackgrounds, it’s in their best \ninterest to see these tax returns.\nOur inquiry of full transparency \nis only continuing to grow and \nallowing the public to see such \ninformation can help Americans \nmake an informed and logical vote. \nIt is vital that nominees for public \noffice are a part of the vetting \nprocess and presidential nominees \nshould be held to the highest \nstandard. \nWe need to be confident that our \npresident is not in it for financial \ngain or personal interests. \nWhile the law does not require \npresidential candidates to disclose \ntax return forms, many politicians \nhave proposed bills that would \nrequire this in future races.\nA recently proposed bill called the \nPresidential Tax Transparency Act by \nU.S. Senator Ron Wyden would require \ncandidates to release their most recent \ntax returns in the previous three years \nwithin 15 days of becoming a party’s \nformal nominee. \nTh e American people need to \nsupport proposed bills such as this one \nto gain an understanding of the full \nintegrity of the candidates before an \nelection occurs, not aft er.\nIn a democracy like ours, \ntransparency should be the regularly \npracticed gold standard.\nIt’s much more than just seeing \nmoney going in and out, it’s about truth \nand trust: two things a president should \nalways provide, no matter the cost.\nsjsunews.com/spartan_daily \nTHURSDAY, NOV. 21, 2019ELECTION OPINION 7\nACROSS\n1.

Budgeting, building \ncredit, savings, retirement, job \nsecurity, benefits, pensions and \nmany other topics are among some \nthat would be highly beneficial. \nSincerely, \nAshley Hekkert\njournalism junior\nSanta Clara County needs \nmore health clinics in area\nBad communication will \nlead to a lot of confusion\nDear editor, \nSanta Clara County residents \nthat are without health insurance is \n6.53% and those who are unsheltered \n(homeless) are 82% in the year of \n2019. We have to question who do \nthese people go to when they are \nin need of services that pertain to \ntheir health. \nIf you haven’t questioned it, you \nshould because this person could be \nyou or a family member. \nEveryone should have the right to \nbe treated and seen when ill, however \nthat isn’t always the case. \nMy solution to this issue is to have \na pop-up clinic once a month in Santa \nClara County specifi cally Downtown \nSan Jose. \nTh e pop-up clinic would be a rented \nspace where medical practitioners \nand holistic healers would be able to \ntreat every single person who walks \nin the door. \nIn order to make this happen we’d \nhave volunteers from the community \nwho are licensed in the medical fi eld \nthat would dedicate their time to \nthose in need. \nTh e purpose of this clinic is not \nonly to treat those who have not been \nseen but to educate the public on how \nwe can better serve others. \nI would like this clinic to raise \nmuch awareness on the media that it \ncould become a permanent clinic in \nmultiple towns of Santa Clara County \nand prevent less people from being ill.\nSincerely,\nRaquel Valenzuela\ncommunication studies senior\nDear editor,\nI am writing out of concern \nand irritation over the current \nsituation in the Campus Village B \nlaundry room. \nStudents had expressed concern \nover the outdated, and oft en broken, \nlaundry machines throughout \ncampus housing and especially \nin CVB for some time before \nthis point. \nWhile the housing administration \nis now fi nally addressing that issue, \nthe way they have gone about it has \ncaused even more inconvenience. \nTh e housing administration \nremoved every CVB laundry machine \non the same day, without giving \nstudents any meaningful time to \nprepare. \nA single email was sent on the \nsame day as the removal, and \nthough signs were placed outside \nthe laundry room many students \ngo infrequently enough to have \nmissed it or just didn’t notice the \nsmall signs. \nTh is has forced us residents to use \nthe much smaller laundry rooms \nin Campus Village C and Joe West \nwe’ve been allowed access to, both of \nwhich are incredibly inadequate to \nserve their normal residents and the \nresidents from CVB. Additionally, \nwhile Joe West recently had its laundry \nmachines replaced, CVC’s machines \nare in just as bad a condition as the \nmachines being replaced in CVB.\nA simple solution that would \nhave saved residents a signifi cant \namount of trouble, would just \nbe to stagger the removal and \nreplacement of the machines \nin CVB. \nTh ey could have easily removed \none row or aisle of the laundry \nmachines at a time, allowing students \nto continue using the machines as \nthey were being replaced. \nTh is would also introduce students \nto the new system gradually instead \nof being thrown in when using the \nJoe West laundry rooms, or the \nnew machines in CVB once they’re \nreplaced. \nI would also argue that a few \nmore emails in preparation for this \nswitch would have been very helpful \nto residents, including myself, \nand saved us from the annoyance \nand inconvenience this situation \nhas caused.\nSincerely,\nLily A.

Just a month ago, I was \nchased down by a man who grabbed \nme and claimed that my bag was his. \nI had to push him away and run as \nfast as I could, screaming for help. \nThere are many other instances \nwhere I have been cat-called, or \neven persistently asked to get in \nsomeone’s car. \nTo address this issue, I would like \nto propose a community within the \nSJSU Sammy App that supports a \n“buddy system.”\nThat way, when students are \nwalking to the bus station from \nschool at night, they can call, \nmessage, or notify another student \nto help them walk to the designated \nbus stop. \nThe student who decides to help \ncan be traveling in the same direction \nor is just not busy at the time. \nNot only will this help security \nwithin SJSU’s boundaries, but also \nbuild a stronger community and \npossibly friendships.  \nSincerely, \nGia Pham\njournalism junior\nHave a story idea?\nContact us at\nspartandaily@gmail.com.\nDear editor,\nI wanted to write about winter \nsessions at SJSU. \nIt shouldn’t allow students to take \nwinter sessions as they are taking away \nfrom other students who may have done \nthat class in fall, spring or summer. \nAllowing students to take the easy \nway out with a two-week class won’t \nallow students to fully understand \nwhat they need to learn.\nA possible solution for this is not \ndoing winter sessions at all. \nAnother solution is suggesting \nstudents to do summer classes so that \nthey are able to take the class  if they can’t \nduring the spring or fall semesters. \nAnother solution can be if you want \nto allow students to take it, make it \nthe week aft er fall semester so that \nthey will have to take the class for a \nwhole month at least.\nSincerely,\nMarcus Guillen\ncommunication studies junior\nShort winter courses \naward the lazy students\n“Every offense is \ndifferent, so, what we \nsee on film, we have a \ngameplan to attack it \nand we’re gonna execute \nthat gameplan to get the \noutcome that we want,” \nLenard said.\nIf the Spartans leave \nLas Vegas as winners, \nthe last game of the \nseason is a home tilt \nagainst Fresno State \nand will decide whether \nor not the team is \nbowl eligible.\nOn Saturday, Nov. 30, \nCEFCU Stadium will host \nsenior night against the \nBulldogs in a fight for the \nValley Trophy.\nThe trophy represents \nhigh-tech capitol Silicon \nValley facing off against \nthe agriculturally-rich \nSan Joaquin Valley, \naccording to the SJSU \nAthletics website.\nThe Fresno State \ngame will be televised \non ESPN2.\nSPORTSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, NOV. 21, 201910\nSpartans need pair of wins for bowl bid\nBy Brendan Cross\nSTAFF WRITER\nNow-senior quarterback Josh Love hands the ball off to now-junior running back Tyler Nevens.

The \nSpartans hung  50 \npoints on the Runnin’ \nRebels for their only win \nof the season.\nUNLV’s defense has \nbeen spotty, allowing \n33 points per game \nthis season.\nSenior wide receiver \nBailey Gaither said the \nopponent on the other side \nof the field doesn’t matter, \nhe and the team still needs \nto execute.\n“For the most \npart, we look at every \nteam [as] nameless, \nfaceless opponents,” \nGaither said. \n“We have an objective \nthat we try and \nmake happen.”\nGaither was a redshirt \nfreshman during his \nfirst season on the team, \nmaking him one of the \nonly active players who \nexperienced the last \ntime SJSU played in a \nbowl game.\n“It would be cool to \nobviously go to another \none, so this is just one \nstep in the way on \nSaturday,” Gaither said. \nUNLV made a starting \nquarterback change \nduring the season, sitting \njunior Armani Rogers \nin favor of freshman \nKenyon Oblad. \n“I really like how he \nplays, I think [this] \nkid’s going to be a \nreally good player,” \nBrennan said about \nOblad. “It’s always \na tough deal when \n[teams] have played \nmultiple quarterbacks, \nbut it’s just something \nthat you have to try and \nprepare for.”\nRegardless of who is \ntaking the snaps, junior \nsafety Jay Lenard said \nthe Runnin’ Rebels are a \nquality opponent based \non his film study.\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n@BrendanCross93\nFor the most \npart, we look at \nevery team [as] \nnameless, faceless \nopponents.

Despite \nboth shows providing \ncomedy gold for millions \nof viewers, “Friends” is the \nbetter show.\nWhile “How I Met Your \nMother” fans admit the \nshow took inspiration from \n“Friends,” it’s obvious that \n“How I Met Your Mother” is \na rip-off .\nTh e common argument \nfor fans who prefer “How I \nMet Your Mother” is that it \nhas stronger comedic value \nand general unpredictability, \ndespite having an \noverarching narrative.\n“Friends” focused on the \nmoment-to-moment lives of \neach character, showing that \nlife is full of surprises and \nconstant change.\nTh e undeniable message \nthat both shows share is that \nlife is a complicated and \nbeautiful journey, full of \nheartache, love and over-the-\ntop people.\nTh rough “How I Met Your \nMother,” audiences learn that \neach moment in life weaved \na tapestry to a much larger \npicture and everything will \neventually come together, \njust not the way you \nexpect it.\nBut “Friends” stuck \ncloser to living in the now, \nsomething I personally \nappreciate at a point in my \nlife when I’m constantly \nworried about the future.\nBoth shows had a star-\nstudded cast at the time, with \nJason Segel and Neil Patrick \nHarris on “How I Met \nYour Mother” and Jennifer \nAniston and Courtney Cox \non “Friends.”\nHowever, the cast \nmembers for both shows \nwere used to convey diff erent \ncomedic tones as a way of \ndistinguishing the shows.\nAlthough “Friends” had \nvery strong comedic tones, \nit stuck relatively close to \nreality and had a consistent \ntone throughout the series.\n“How I Met Your Mother,” \non the other hand, was \nnarrated from the future and \nused a romanticized and \ncomedic refl ection on \nthe past.\nTh is in turn gave the \ncreators of “How I Met Your \nMother” the opportunity \nto use diff erent tones \nthroughout the series and \nstill be able to stick the \nlanding for the majority of \nthe show.\nBut it fell apart with an \nunnecessarily controversial \nseries fi nale, leaving a bad \ntaste in my mouth.\nFrom the core group of \nfriends with the running \ngags and the New York City \nsetting, “Friends” developed \na clear aesthetic and feel that \n“How I Met Your Mother” \ncopied for a more \nmodern time.\nFor anyone choosing \nbetween the two shows, \n“Friends” is essential to \nwatch fi rst because it is the \ngold standard that other \nsitcoms have since followed.\nThe pizza \ntasted as if \nChef Boyardee \nhimself was \nin the kitchen \nand decided \nto dump an \nentire can \nof spaghetti \nsauce on a thin \nslice of

\nwould just be lying.\nThe “local organic \ntomato” pizza looked like \na blistered foot that had \njust run a marathon.\nThe bubbly cheese cysts \nwere not only unbearable \nto my eyes, but to my \ntongue as well.\nThe pizza tasted as if \nChef Boyardee himself \nwas in the kitchen and \ndecided to dump an entire \ncan of spaghetti sauce on a \nthin slice of bread.\nThe crust at the edge \nwas the only saving grace \nthe pizza had, not only \nbecause it was fluffy and \ndelightful, but also because \nI knew I was finally done \neating the slice.\nThe Spring Cream slice \nwas next in line for me to \nconsume and this pizza \nhad my attention.\nThe pale mozzarella \ncheese base accentuated \nthe criss-crossed pattern \nof pesto sauce topping, \nbut sadly looking \nat the slice was the \nonly satisfaction this \npizza gave me.\nWhere the Margherita \nslice tasted of pure \npizza sauce, this wedge \nwas like eating a \njumble of wet toppings \non bread.\nThe pizza was hard to \nconsume for the simple \nfact that it was a bland \nmouthful of mush.\nThe restaurant’s savior \namongst the pizza debacle \nis that it is a great cafe \nthat has an array of  craft \nbeers, wines, coffees \nand on-tap kombucha to \nchoose from.\nThat’s cool and all, \nbut the restaurant is \ncalled Pizza Flora, not \nCafe Flora.\nI felt betrayed that \na location that bears \n“pizza” in its name could \nnot execute a $5 slice of \npizza properly.\nFor the same price as two \npizza slices I would have \nmuch rather settled for a \nLittle Caesars pizza with \nsome Crazy Bread and \nthat is not a compliment \nto Little Caesars by \nany means.\nThe service was quick \nand I appreciated the \nwelcoming aura the \ncashier radiated, but with \nso many pizza options \nnear campus for me to \nchoose from, a friendly \nsmile is not going to lure \nme back in for a second \nvisit.\nIf you are looking for \na relaxed cafe downtown \nto sit and have a drink, \nthen maybe Pizza Flora is \nthe
