In addition tobeing at high risk for HIV, young key populations (YKP) may experience other health problems attributable to high-risk behaviouror their developmental stage, or a combination of both.Methods: We reviewed the needs, barriers and gaps for other non-HIV health services for YKP.We searched PubMed and GoogleScholar for articles that provided specific age-related data on sexual and reproductive health; mental health; violence; andsubstance use problems for adolescent, youth or young sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, andpeople who inject drugs.Results: YKP experience more unprotected sex, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, unintended pregnancy, violence,mental health disorders and substance use compared to older members of key populations and youth among the generalpopulation. YKP experience significant barriers to accessing care; coverage of services is low, largely because of stigma anddiscrimination experienced at both the health system and policy levels.Discussion: YKP require comprehensive, integrated services that respond to their specific developmental needs, including health,educational and social services within the context of a human rights-based approach. The recent WHO Consolidated Guidelineson HIV Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment and Care for Key Populations are an important first step for a more comprehensiveapproach to HIV programming for YKP, but there are limited data on the effective delivery of combined interventions for YKP.Significant investments in research and implementation will be required to ensure adequate provision and coverage of servicesfor YKP. In addition, greater commitments to harm reduction and rights-based approaches are needed to address structuralbarriers to access to care.Keywords: adolescent; youth; injecting drug use; MSM; sex workers; risk; integrated services.Received 29 September 2014; Revised 8 January 2015; Accepted 21 January 2015; Published 26 February 2015Copyright:– 2015 Delany-Moretlwe S et al; licensee International AIDS Society.

Globally, the health of young people is importantas it is an indicator of future population health, and alsosocial and economic development. Although the rate of newHIV infections has declined or stabilized in many populations,over a third of new HIV infections continue to occur amongthe 15- to 24-year age group [3]. HIV risk and prevalence arenot uniform; people who sell sex (SW), inject drugs (PWID),men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people(TG) have been shown to have higher risks for HIV infec-tion than the general population [4\u00036]. Many practice morethan one risk behaviour. For example, young MSM may alsouse drugs and sell sex for drugs, emphasizing the need forcomprehensive, integrated health services. Key populations(KP) contribute disproportionately to HIV transmission dy-namics within countries, with recent estimates suggesting that50% of new HIV infection occur among these populations [7].In addition to their high-risk behaviour, KP frequentlyexperience significant stigma, discrimination and violence,which further limits their ability to adopt preventive beha-viours and access health services [8]. In YKP, the effects ofstigma, discrimination and violence are exacerbated by policyand legal barriers related to the age of consent for sex as wellas selected medical interventions, further limiting access toa range of health services [7]. As a consequence, YKP arefrequently a hidden population, and reliable and representa-tive epidemiological data on their health are scarce [7]. Thispaucity of data often leads to neglect of their specific needsby programmes designed either for young people moregenerally, or for adult KP. Failure to identify the comprehensivehealth needs of YKP, and their specific barriers to care, hasthe potential to undermine the success of HIV preventionprogrammes targeted at these populations [9].Conceptual framework for adolescent healthWhile YKP require specific interventions for the prevention,treatment and care of HIV, YKP also require non-HIV-relatedDelany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983329health services that respond to the health needs of theirparticular developmental life stage. The complex physical,psychological, emotional and social changes that take placeduring adolescence have immediate and long-term implica-tions for individuals [9]. For example, the onset of pubertyis linked to the initiation of sexual activity, and subsequentexposure to the risk of pregnancy and STIs, including HIV.Awareness of sexual orientation emerges during this period.Mental health disorders also emerge during the seconddecade of life. High rates of self-harm are observed inyoung people, and suicide is a leading cause of death [10].Increased risk-taking and a heightened sensitivity to peersmay influence adolescent experimentation with substanceuse. Although risk-taking is considered a normal part ofadolescent development, risk-taking by YKP can have seriousadverse consequences. More than any other life stage,adolescent health is strongly determined by social context.Both structural determinants of health (e.g. national wealth,income inequality, access to education and health services,employment opportunities and gender inequality) and moreproximate determinants of health (e.g. connectedness ofadolescents to family and school) affect health-related be-haviour and outcomes during adolescence [11]. It is notsurprising therefore that poor sexual and reproductive health(SRH), mental health disorders, violence and injury, andsubstance use account for the majority of disability anddisease experienced by people aged 10\u000324 globally [12].Sawyer and colleagues have proposed a conceptual frame-work to enhance our understanding of adolescent health anddevelopment (Figure 1) [9]. The horizontal axis describes alife-course perspective from the pre-conceptual and prenatalperiod through to adulthood. The vertical axis describes thesocial determinants of health and the pathways by whichthese influence health outcomes. The nexus of these twoaxes is the period of adolescence, a time of enormousphysical, emotional, mental and social transition. Policy andprogrammatic responses to adolescent health operate alongthe vertical axis, but should not be developed withoutan appreciation for the importance of adolescence withina life-course perspective [9]. Guided by this conceptual ap-proach, we review the needs, barriers and gaps for non-HIV-related services for YKP as part of a special series of paperson YKP.MethodsWe focused our review on those non-HIV-related services thatare developmentally relevant to this population based on theconceptual framework outlined above, and/or included asrecommended interventions in the recently published WHOConsolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention, Diagnosis, Treat-ment and Care for Key Populations (Table 1). We undertooka targeted, web-based search to identify age-specific dataon the health needs and barriers to care for YKP aged 10\u000324.Using PubMed and Google Scholar, we focused on articlespublished in English since 1990, with a particular emphasison systematic reviews and more recent publications. In orderto identify age-specific data or references we used the keywords ‘‘young,’’ ‘‘youth,’’ ‘‘adolescent,’’ and ‘‘age’’ in combi-nation with search terms for each KP (e.g. ‘‘MSM,’’ ‘‘menwho have sex with men,’’ ‘‘gay,’’ ‘‘bisexual’’) and for eachhealth topic (e.g. ‘‘condoms,’’ ‘‘unprotected sex,’’ ‘‘STI,’’ etc.).Abstracts were retrieved and read, and if relevant age-relateddata were provided, full-text articles were retrieved. Overa 2000 abstracts were identified in the initial searches, butFigure 1. Conceptual framework of adolescent health, adapted from Sawyer et al. [9].Delany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983330far fewer contained age-specific information relevant to YKPand 110 articles with age-specific information were included.Due to the paucity of age-specific data on YKP, articles thatreferred to KP or adolescent populations were used tosupplement searches.ResultsPoor SRH outcomes, mental health disorders, violence andinjury, and substance use account for the majority ofdisability and disease experienced by young people aged10\u000324 globally [12]. We summarized the findings of ourreview which demonstrate overall that YKP experience aneven higher burden of disease than older KP, as well as ahigher burden of disease than their age peers in the generalpopulation.Unprotected sexUnprotected sex is an important risk factor for negativehealth outcomes among young people, accounting for 4% ofdisability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in those aged 10\u000324 [12].Several studies have shown younger age is associated withmore frequent unprotected sex among KP [13], often dueto lower levels of education, knowledge, and risk perception[13\u000315]. Young key populations (YKP) may also be unawareof where to access condoms and other contraception. Thecombination of low condom self-efficacy and more frequentsex or change in sexual partners also puts YKP at higher riskof sexually transmitted infection (STI) [16\u000318]. For many,the ability to negotiate safer sex with partners is limited byimbalances in relationship power, compounded by adolescentaspirations for love and intimacy. For example, althoughcondom use rates may be higher among sex workers thanTable 1. Summary of relevant WHO recommendations for linked services key populations [7]HIV PreventionPost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be available to all eligible people from key populations on a voluntary basis after possible exposure toHIV.All pregnant women from key populations should have the same access to services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) andfollow the same recommendations as women in other populations.Harm reductionAll people from key populations with harmful alcohol or other substance use should have access to evidence-based interventions, includingbrief psychosocial interventions involving assessment, specific feedback and advice.Prevention and management of co-infections and co-morbiditiesKey populations should have the same access to hepatitis B and C prevention, screening and treatment services as other populations at risk of orliving with HIV.Routine screening and management of mental health disorders (depression and psychosocial stress) should be provided for people from keypopulations living with HIV to optimize health outcomes and improve their adherence to ART. Management can range from counselling forHIV and depression to appropriate medical therapies.Sexual and reproductive healthScreening, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections should be offered routinely as part of comprehensive HIV prevention andcare for key populations.People from key populations, including those living with HIV, should be able to experience full, pleasurable sex lives and have access to a rangeof reproductive options.Abortion laws and services should protect the health and human rights of all women, including those from key populations.It is important to offer cervical cancer screening to all women from key populations.(Note: for adolescent populations, HPV vaccination is an additional recommendation for prevention of HPV-associated disease includinganogenital cancers).It is important that all women from key populations have the same support and access to services related to conception and pregnancy care, aswomen from other groups.Critical enablersLaws, policies and practices should be reviewed and, where necessary, revised by policymakers and government leaders, with meaningfulengagement of stakeholders from key population groups, to allow and support the implementation and scale-up of health care services for keypopulations.Countries should work towards implementing and enforcing anti-discrimination and protective laws, derived from human rights standards, toeliminate stigma, discrimination and violence against people from key populations.Health services should be made available, accessible and acceptable to key populations, based on the principles of medical ethics, avoidance ofstigma, non-discrimination and the right to health.Programmes should work towards implementing a package of interventions to enhance community empowerment among key populations.Violence against people from key populations should be prevented and addressed in partnership with key population-led organizations. Allviolence against people from key populations should be monitored and reported, and redressal mechanisms should be established to providejustice.Delany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983331the general population, several studies have shown howyounger sex workers may be less experienced than older sexworkers with condom negotiation, and more vulnerable tobeing forced to have sex without a condom either by clients ormanagers [19,20]. Unprotected sex may also be associatedwith expressions of intimacy or trust, with higher rates for sexwith primary partners, who are often older and thus have hada longer period of potential exposure to HIV and other STI[21\u000323]. In one study of young MSM aged 16\u000320, consideringa relationship to be serious was associated with an eight-foldincrease in the rate of unprotected sex [24]. For TG women,condom negotiation may be more difficult given their femalegender identity and socially constructed role, and young TGpeople may be more likely to have unprotected sex to validatetheir gender identity [13]. Among young PWID, low ratesof condom use are often associated with other high-risk pra-ctices such as needle sharing or smoking drugs together [23].Among young PWID, there are gender differences in risk withhigher rates of unprotected sex and sexual risk observed inyoung women [25]. Given the lower levels of condom useamong YKP, the potential for negative health outcomes in thispopulation is high.Sexually transmitted infectionsThe prevalence of STIs is also higher in YKP than among olderKP peers. Studies show elevated rates of syphilis [26],gonorrhoea [27], chlamydia [28,29] and herpes simplex [30]among YKP compared with adult KP. Young MSM and TGmay be more likely to have anal or rectal infections that areasymptomatic and/or remain undiagnosed [31]. STIs are alsomore common in those populations with more than one riskbehaviour. For example, a prospective study among PWID inBritish Columbia, Canada, found that incident STIs were morefrequent among those involved in the sex trade comparedwith those who did not sell sex, over a three-year period [32].In addition to causing significant morbidity and mortality,STIs also increase the risk of HIV transmission.Two of the viral STIs associated with cancer outcomes arenow vaccine preventable. HPV is a common STI that causescervical and other anogenital cancers. A high prevalence ofHPV infection has been observed in adult KP. In a study ofanal HPV prevalence and risk factors among men in Brazil,Mexico and the United States, among MSM, younger age wasassociated with increased prevalence of any anal canal HPV[33]. YKP may be exposed to HPV earlier and may be more atrisk of developing of pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions inlater life, especially if they are co-infected with HIV. Althoughaccess to HPV vaccination has expanded significantly in thepast five years, young MSM or TG women may not benefitfrom vaccination programmes targeted at young girls, andmay not receive the benefit afforded to heterosexual menthrough herd immunity [34].YKP may be at increased risk for viral hepatitis. Hepatitis Cvirus (HCV) incidence in young PWID is high, raising concernsabout the prevention and control of an expanding epidemicin young people [35]. A study on young PWID in Afghanistanshowed that risk of HCV infection increased with eachadditional year of injecting among young PWID [36]. Youngfemale PWID were reported to have a higher incidence ofHCV, associated with higher risk injection practices, whencompared to young men [37]. Young MSM are also atincreased risk of viral hepatitis A and B [38]. YKP wouldbenefit from vaccination against hepatitis A and B in settingswhere universal childhood vaccination is not routine. Wherevaccination is offered to MSM, coverage is still relativelylow, although promising data from several studies show thatvaccine uptake is associated with younger age [39].Reproductive healthIn addition to STIs, a frequent outcome of unprotected sex infemale YKP is unintended pregnancy, which during adoles-cence can pose particular risks to both mother and infant[40]. Data on pregnancy intentions, outcomes, and use ofcontraception or prevention of mother-to-child-transmission(PMTCT) in YKP are limited. Studies in adult female sex workersshow that pregnancy is frequently unwanted, terminationof pregnancy is common and contraceptive use, including ofemergency contraception, is low, suggesting significant unmetneeds [41\u000343]. A recent study among Chinese adolescentsex workers showed that a quarter had never used a moderncontraceptive method [44]. The main method of pregnancyprevention in this population was condoms, although condomuse was often inconsistent. Half of those interviewed reporteda previous induced abortion, although only a third of thosehad sought care from public sector services. These data aresupported by another study in Chinese sex workers show-ing that younger sex workers were less likely to terminatetheir pregnancy, but those that did were more likely to seektermination from informal providers [45]. For HIV-positive YKP,PMTCT is a priority. While few data are available on accessto PMTCT in YKP, given high rates of HIV infection in thispopulation, there is likely to be a significant need. In a study ofPWID in Ukraine, PWID were more likely than non-PWID tobe diagnosed during labour and to have more advanced HIVdisease, but less likely to receive prophylaxis or HAARTto prevent vertical transmission. As a consequence, verticaltransmission rates in this population were higher than in thegeneral population [46].Young TG have specific health needs related to their genderidentity. Hormone therapy may have significant benefits forTG people, but access is frequently limited by cost or providerattitudes. As a consequence, some TG may seek hormonetherapy from the non-medical sources [47], despite potentialside effects from unmonitored treatment including overdose[48], or the risk associated with injecting hormones or silicone[49]. In some cases, young TG may engage in sex work to fundtreatments [50]. Services for YKP need to be able to providereliable, evidence-informed information regarding TG-specificmedical and surgical procedures.Sexual assaultYKP are more likely to require sexual assault services includingaccess to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). While no age-specific data were provided, a recent systematic review of theprevalence and correlates of violence against sex workersestimated that the lifetime prevalence of any violence rangedfrom 45% to 75% [51]. Young trafficked sex workers may haveexperienced violent rape in order to coerce them to sell sex[18,52]. Young male sex workers are not immune, and studiesDelany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983332show that they also experience verbal, physical and sexualabuse [53]. In a study of MSM in Thailand, 18% had ex-perienced forced sex, the majority by someone they knew,and the forced sex occurred more than once, with the firstexperience occurring during adolescence [54]. While esti-mates of the prevalence of sexual assault among PWID arelimited, a recent study among women aged 16\u000329 attendingfamily planning services in Pennsylvania, USA, showed 11%of women had experienced sexual violence in the previousthree months, and that sexual assault was associated withinjection drug use, their own or their partners [55]. Experi-ences of violence are strongly associated with increased riskbehaviour and risk for HIV [18,56,57], as well as other negativeSRH outcomes [58,59]. Interventions that address sexualassault and that provide access to PEP are a critical componentof a package of services for YKP [7].Mental healthWhile emergence of mental health problems in the seconddecade of life is common, data suggest that YKP experiencehigher rates of mental health problems when compared withtheir same age counterparts in the general population, orolder key population peers. For example, a study of youngSW in China showed that those younger than age 20 ex-perienced the highest rates of depression, suicide and sub-stance use compared to those older than 20 [60]. A study inlesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth in the USobserved higher rates of mental disorders in this populationcompared to the general population [61]. Major depression,personality and substance use disorders are more common inyoung PWID [62], with higher rates of mental health disordersobserved in young women [63].Among the factors that influence poor mental health inyoung KP, stigma, discrimination, social exclusion and victimi-zation are substantial contributors. For example, a studyamong young PWID in Russia showed that a large proportionhad experienced discrimination resulting in loss of jobs, lackof access to health care and being forced from their familyhomes. Over one-third had clinical depression [64]. A studyin Chinese sex workers showed that the majority had highlevels of self-stigma, and that this was significantly associatedwith poor mental health [65]. In a US study of young MSM,experiences of victimization were strongly associated with asyndemic of depression, substance use, risky sex and intimatepartner violence; these factors were also strongly associatedwith an increase in suicide attempts [66]. These findings wereechoed in a global study of MSM in 151 countries [67], anda study in young TG women [68]. Violence experienced at thehands of family, partners, clients or police is associated withincreased reporting of poor mental health outcomes [69\u000372].Substance useSubstance use and experimentation are common in ado-lescence, but evidence suggests that YKP are more likelyto initiate substance use at an earlier age, to engage inpolysubstance use and to experience more rapid increases insubstance use over time [73,74]. This is of particular concerngiven the findings that substance use in adolescence may bemore harmful to brain function and behaviour while the brainis still developing [75]. YKP may frequent social spaces wherealcohol and drug use are tolerated and consumption normal-ized. YKP may initiate substance use to self-medicate againstthe anxiety associated with group behaviours, or associatednegative experiences [76,77]. A study in Australian LGBT youthhighlighted a higher prevalence of alcohol and drug use inthis population compared to the general population. In thisstudy, alcohol use was significantly higher in those youngerthan 18, and those who believed that homophobia influencedalcohol and drug use were significantly more likely to usealcohol or drugs [78]. Substance use may increase sexualdesire, lower inhibitions and impair decision-making. A studyof young TG women in the US documented that this groupwas significantly less likely to use condoms with main partnerswhile under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Substanceuse may reduce an individual’s concerns about safe sex in theface of other, more important desires and immediate priorities[22]. Several other studies among YKP have shown thatdrinking beforehand can be associated with unprotected sexand injecting behaviours [76,79,80].The risks associated with injecting drug use are dis-proportionately high. Problem drug use often starts withrecreational drug use, and studies show that the transitionfrom non-injecting to injecting drug use in young people israpid and high [77]. Early initiation of injecting drug use isassociated with younger age and being female [25,81].Young PWID are frequently initiated into drug use by peers[82,83]; young women more often are initiated by a sexpartner [77,84]. A study in Ukraine reported that in 56% ofboys and 72% of girls, the first injection was unplanned andoften occurred after exposure to injecting among friends,with around 32% of girls initiated by their sexual partners[85]. Young PWID are more likely to inject in groups, anddevelop rituals associated with injecting that expose themto sharing of non-sterile equipment. Studies in young PWIDshow more frequent sharing of equipment, more frequentinjecting and injecting in public spaces [86,87]. Young PWIDare more likely to practice unprotected sex, have increasednumbers of partners, or trade sex for drugs than their olderpeers [88,89]. Young PWID may also be less likely to engagein care for their addiction, and are also more likely to reportrelapse after treatment [72,90]. Young PWID have muchhigher mortality rates than their peers in the general popu-lation, associated with overdose or injury [91]. They have asubstantial need for harm reduction and addiction treat-ment services, as well as links to services to address theirintegrated health and social needs.Educational, vocational and social supportIn addition to health care, YKP frequently require socialsupport because of their life stage as well as socio-structuralfactors that influence their behaviour. YKP may be orphanedor rejected by their families, experiencing homelessness, foodinsecurity and economic instability [56,92,93], and may oftenprioritize food, shelter and money over health [94]. FemaleYKPmay have concerns about thewelfare of their own children[95]. Access to social support and benefits is thereforeessential to reducing their risk. Completion of education,initiating employment and transitioning out of the child-hood home may be considered a normal part of adolescentDelany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983333development, yet YKP may not experience these positively.For example, school bullying and victimization may severelyimpair educational attainment and future employment oppor-tunities of young MSM and TG [96]. For some, low educationalattainment may become a reason to sell sex [97]. Young PWIDwho drop out of schoolmay be at higher risk for HIV [15]. Linkageto educational and vocational support interventions are animportant part of a developmentally appropriate response toYKP, and while not directly linked to HIV programme activitieseducational and vocational interventionsmay be critical enablersfor HIV programme success in this age group.Barriers to careAdolescence is marked by high rates of attrition along thecontinuum of HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment ser-vices. YKP are less likely to be engaged in care [98], andcoverage of services is low. While data are limited for YKP,evidence from young adult and adult populations shows thatKP experience poor access to condoms and HIV testing [99],may present later for HIV treatment [100] and have lowerrates of adherence [101], viral suppression [102] and retentionin care [103]. PMTCT outcomes and access to linked mentalhealth, substance use and SRH services are poor [46,104].PWID may experience difficulty in accessing safe injectingequipment or treatment for dependence. Using the concep-tual framework (Figure 1), reasons for poor access to carecan be categorized as individual-level, health-system-level orstructural-level barriers, and are common to all YKP.Individual-level barriers to careLow levels of education and HIV knowledge or risk percep-tion are associated with low uptake of HIV services [13]. YKPwith less formal education and/or less sex education maybe less familiar with what constitute safe sex or safe injec-tion practices. YKP with internalized stigma experience moresocial isolation and are less able to ask trusted adults forsupport in decision-making [105]. They may also experiencebullying by older KP [106]. YKP who have experienced poormental health, violence or low levels of social support mayhave lower levels of self-efficacy for health-seeking [107].Health-system-level barriers to carePerhaps the most significant barrier to health-seeking amongYKP is the experience of stigma, discrimination or victimizationat the hands of health care providers (HCP). In a study ofyoung migrant sex workers in North Vietnam, despite healthcare being available, the young women perceived the stigmaattached to sex work as a barrier to receiving health care, andpreferred to receive health education and care frompeers [52].In another study involving male, female and TG sex workersin Africa, denial of treatment for injuries following physicalassault or rape and general hostility from public sector pro-viders were common [108]. Similar experiences were reportedby PWID in India [70]. Younger PWID expressed a preferencefor syringe-dispensing machines over staffed needle exchangeprogrammes because of their desire to hide their identity orbecause they did not like the way they were treated at staffedservices [109]. Concerns about privacy and confidentiality arean important barrier to care. In a US-based study, LGBT youthexpressed greater concerns about confidentiality and wereless likely to seek care from school-based services comparedto heterosexual peers [110]. In addition to concerns aboutpoor attitudes, HCP may not have sufficient skill, competenceor training to deal with the specific health and social needsof YKP. A US survey of HCP reported that the majority ofrespondents would not regularly discuss sexual orientation,sexual attraction or gender identity while taking a sexualhistory from a sexually active adolescent. The majority ofphysicians did not believe that they had all the necessary skillsto address issues of sexual orientation with adolescents [111].Studies reveal that provider willingness to answer questions,their respect for and understanding of adolescents and theresponsiveness of the social and physical environment towardsyouth are all associated with young people’s intention toseek and engage in care [112]. Negative experiences withproviders may prompt YKP to seek care from non-conventionalservices [47]. For YKP, cost and waiting time are also barriersto care [103]. Young people are less likely to have access toready cash and may have competing demands or less controlover their time. In several studies, YKP highlight the impor-tance of integrated services that address their multiple healthneeds [113]. Lack of service integration adds time and costto clinic visits and may be a further barrier to care. In manycases, services for KP may not be sufficiently ‘‘youth-friendly.’’Providers may not have an appreciation for the specifichealth and communication needs of YKP. YKP may experiencediscomfort when seeking care with adults. Location andtransport may also be a barrier to care. Larger, more formalvenues can enhance prevention initiatives, including on-siteservices. Geographical targeting of services for YKP can becomplicated by the social and sexual networking patterns ofYKP whomay find partners through the Internet, meet them ininformal venues, and generally be more mobile. This canincrease the risk involved and makes it harder for services toidentify and reach them [114].Structural-level barriersCriminalization reduces YKP’s control over their behaviour,impedes their access to health services and obstructs health-service provision and legal protection. In many settings, YKPare criminalized for their behaviour/s and risk incarceration[115,116]. Even in settings where activities are not crimina-lized, they may experience significant stigma, discriminationor police harassment, as a result of both their group identityand their age [117\u0003119]. Studies of MSM in African countrieswhere homosexuality is criminalized demonstrate how crim-inalization makes MSM more vulnerable to violence and lessable to access health care or preventive services [99,119,120].YKP are vulnerable to harassment and exploitation by thepolice, and may go to substantial lengths to avoid police.A mapping study in Canada showed a significant geographicrelationship between a heavily concentrated core area ofhealth and syringe availability and avoidance of these settingsby substance using street-based sex workers due to policing;this correlation was strongest among younger women [121].Several studies have highlighted how police arrest YKP forcarrying drug paraphernalia or confiscate it without arrest[70,122]. Arrest and detention are frequently associated withpolice beatings; a Thai study among young PWID showed thatDelany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983334younger age was associated with more frequent reports ofpolice beating [118]. In addition to physical violence, YKP arealso vulnerable to sexual coercion and violence at the hands ofauthorities [123].Access to care is further confounded by the legal statusof YKP as minors. In many countries, adolescents requireparental permission to access testing, treatments or proce-dures. This is a particular problem for minors who do not livewith their parents or do not wish to disclose their behaviourto them. For example, young women seeking contraceptionor safe abortion services are likely to seek care outside ofconventional health services [45]. In many countries whereopioid substitution services are available, age restrictionsare placed on them [124]. In some settings, HCP are legallyobliged to report underage sex or other illegal activities.This may compromise disclosure and provision of adequatecare for risky behaviours. Age restrictions are also placed onaccess to housing and other social services which may beneeded.An absence of clear legal status may also be a barrier foraccess to health services. TG people may experience signifi-cant barriers to obtaining services, legal entitlements andlegal protection because the gender assignment on theiradministrative documents may be in conflict with their genderidentity [113]. Migrant YKP may also not have adequatelegal documentation of citizenship, and may not be able toaccess services in their host country. As adolescents, they areoften dependent on parents for the provision of informationnecessary for citizenship or travel documentation.The absenceof appropriate official documentation may make them vulner-able by limiting their access to health and social services andbenefits that they might otherwise be entitled to.Many YKP experience additional stigma and discrimina-tion associated with their racial or ethnic identity, in additionto their group identity. There is overwhelming evidencefrom the United States that young Black MSM have thehighest concentration of HIV of any sub-population despitelittle evidence of higher risk behaviour. Instead, social andstructural factors act as barriers to health care access [125].In other settings, YKP from either indigenous or migrantpopulations aremarginalized and have limited access to healthservices [87].DiscussionDespite the paucity of age-specific data for YKP, this reviewconfirms that in addition to interventions for the prevention,treatment and care of HIV, YKP also require other, non-HIV-related health services that respond to their significanthealth and development needs as adolescents. The WHOrecommendations for a comprehensive package of servicesthat includes SRH services and care for mental health disordersis an important first step in recognizing the impact of theseother health concerns on the success of HIV prevention,treatment and care interventions [7]. These guidelines speci-fically recognize the health and developmental needs ofYKP, and provide commentary on specific considerations forthe delivery of health sector interventions to YKP.The next priority is to ensure that these recommendationsare implemented at scale and with sufficient intensity toensure an impact on the HIV epidemic, and the health ofYKP. While there is substantial evidence for effective inter-ventions to prevent and treat HIV infection in adults, less isknown about the delivery of these interventions to adoles-cents [126]. Current coverage of services for YKP is generallylow [127,128], and consideration of optimal service deliverymodels that respond to current barriers to care are nowa priority. The requirement to make services accessible,acceptable and available to YKP provides an opportunity toevaluate interventions aimed at addressing health systembarriers to care. Beyer and colleagues have proposed threemodels of service provision for KP: integrated models of care,stand-alone models of care or hybrid models of serviceprovision [8]. Integrating HIV and related service provision forYKP into primary health care (PHC) offers significant potentialfor expanding coverage and access to care for YKP, and maybe the only option for service delivery in some settings.Integrated models have the potential to address several ofthe health systems barriers. Sensitization of services andtraining of all staff in facilities, not just HCP, is a potentiallypowerful structural intervention to enhance the effective-ness of HIV programmes for YKP and reduce stigma moregenerally. There are a number of positive approaches tostigma reduction, with growing experience on how to workwith HCP and communities to reduce anticipated and en-acted stigma [129]. There is accumulating evidence to sug-gest that interventions using a combination of sensitizationand participatory activities can reduce HIV stigma in healthcare [130,131] and community settings [132,133]. A recentsystematic review identified 48 evaluations in which HIV-related stigma was assessed as an outcome [134]. While thestudies found that information, skills building, counsellingand PLHIV testimonials were associated with less stigmatiz-ing attitudes among participants, the evidence base hadmany gaps. Training and sensitization of HCP to the needsof MSM has also been shown in a study in Kenya to reducehomophobic attitudes up to three months after training[135]. In addition to stigma reduction interventions, initia-tives to make PHC more ‘‘adolescent and youth-friendly’’ arelikely to benefit the subset of YKP. Evidence from severalsystematic reviews confirms that implementation of a com-bination of interventions, including training of HCP, outreachactivities and out-of-facility services tailored to context andtarget population, demonstrated some impact on uptakeof health services by young people [126], although trainingof service providers in adolescent-friendly service provisionalone appears to be less beneficial [128].Peer approaches are potentially a critical component ofservices for YKP, given the particular developmental suscept-ibility of adolescents to peer influence. Peers are in a uniqueposition to identify and reach out to YKP who may beexperiencing barriers to health care through lack of knowl-edge, risk perception or self-efficacy. Evidence from asystematic review of interventions to improve linkage andretention in HIV care in low- and middle-income countriessupports integrating formalized care with peer support toincrease the uptake of HIV services, although data onadolescents are limited [136]. While peer interventions forYKP have been found to be positively associatedwith increasedDelany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983335knowledge and condom use in some programmes [13],they are optimal when included as part of a comprehensiveempowerment approach [137]. There is growing evidencethat empowerment approaches for SW in particular improveHIV programme outcomes [138]. In addition, empower-ment approaches are likely to have benefits for other healthchallenges, particularly violence. Evidence from programmeassessments show that it is possible to prevent violenceusing empowerment approaches, with some interventionsachieving significant effects within programme timeframes[139]. Integrated services delivered at scale offer a signifi-cant platform for the delivery of community mobilizationand empowerment interventions. Despite the growing evi-dence that empowerment approaches produce health bene-fits, effective implementation of empowerment processeswithin many settings, particularly in Africa, has been limited[140]. Challenges to the sustainability of empowermentinterventions include lack of social cohesion within transientcommunities, limited capacity and resources, and variablecommitment of programmers to empowerment interventions.Given these challenges, and the fact that integrated modelsmay not sufficiently address the barriers presented by lackof privacy and accessibility, cost or waiting times, or the needfor access to a range of non-health services, alternativemodelswarrant further exploration.While there is a precedent for stand-alone models ofservice delivery for KP [141], they may not be suitable inmany settings. While these services may be able to provideKP-sensitive services, they may also increase stigma andmarginalization, and provide targets for attack. An alternativeto stand-alone facilities are out-of-facility-based deliverystrategies. Currently data are limited on the benefits of out-of-facility-based approaches to health care delivery amongadolescents, although two reviews suggest that servicesdelivered through mixed-use youth centres are not well-used or particularly effective for adolescents in the generalpopulation [128]. The authors do note, however, the absenceof studies or evaluations examining outcomes among vulner-able or marginalized adolescents. Programmatic experiencesuggests that drop-in centres provide a valuable opportunityto offer a range of services specific to the needs of YKP.For example, as an alternative to integrating adolescent PWIDinto programming targeted at adult injectors, who can appearthreatening and model harmful behaviours, Moldovan NGOsestablished drop-in centres welcoming adolescents withoverlapping risks, including those living on the street, injectingdrugs or involved in sex work. A case management approachthen linked individuals to a network of health and socialservices [142]. Linkage to non-health services is generallyvalued by YKP [103,113], and may even encourage retention incare. Medical and food incentives have been found to increaseretention in care prior to antiretroviral treatment initiation[136], emphasizing the importance of non-HIV-related servicedelivery provision. Other out-of-facility options include thetraining of pharmacist to counsel and provide adolescentswith appropriate needle exchange and drug substitutionservices [143]. Work place policies have been used withparticularly good effect in sex work establishments in Asia;however, there is less evidence for how these policies maybenefit YKP [13]. In these cases, strong linkages with childprotection services ensure enforcement of anti-traffickinglaws.While schools are an important venue for the delivery ofhealth education, they may not be an optimal for the deliveryof services to YKP and should be used to complement, notreplace, health care services for adolescents located outsideschools [126].Internet-based interventions represent a different type ofout-of-facility service. The rapid expansion of access to theInternet and social media in the past two decades, even inlow- and middle-income countries, through mobile phonetechnology, represents a significant opportunity to engagewith previously hidden populations, or those that are sociallyor geographically isolated [144,145]. The Internet provides anovel way to expand access to standardized information,to build virtual communities of supportive peers and tolink YKP to services. There is accumulating evidence of theacceptability of delivering digital-based media interven-tions to adolescents, KP or YKP in settings in North America[146\u0003148], South America [149], Asia [150,151] and Africa[152], although there is less evidence on the impact of theseservices on longer term health outcomes [153]. A recentreview evaluated the impact of digital-media-based interven-tions on sexual health knowledge, attitudes and/or beha-viours of adolescents in the general population aged 13\u000324[154]. Of the ten studies reviewed, six studies increasedknowledge of HIV, STI or pregnancy. A recent study amongyoung MSM showed that an Internet-based, peer-led socialmedia HIV prevention intervention can increase communitycohesion and uptake of HIV services [155]. These and otherevaluations of Internet interventions for YKP show positiveshort-term outcomes for health. Given initial findings fromthis and other similar programmes, further evaluation isneeded to gauge the potential benefit of these programmeson health outcomes over a longer period [156].Hybrid models that combine the reach of services inte-grated at PHC level with the peer-based, outreach andempowerment approaches offered by more flexible commu-nity-based NGOs are probably the optimal model of servicedelivery. Ultimately, decisions about service delivery modelsneed to be informed by user preferences, and they needto take into account considerations that are context-specificand address the age-based needs of YKP, as well as respondto their specific risk behaviours, the epidemic setting and thesocial, legal and political complexities associated with servicedelivery for this group. To this end, efforts should be focusedon making YKP more visible through research and monitoring,so that their needs are recognized and prioritized by publichealth systems.While the provision of linked non-HIV-specificservices requires significant investment and innovation, sig-nificant gains in coverage can be achieved with modestincreases in resources [157]. Finally, given the strong influenceof socio-structural factors on adolescent health, coupledwith the fact that many factors that influence YKP’s riskare outside of their immediate control, interventions thataddress the structural barriers to care are a critical part ofan effective HIV response for YKP. In addition to changes inlaws and policies that promote stigma and discrimination,Delany-Moretlwe S et al. Journal of the International AIDS Society 2015, 18(Suppl 1):19833http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19833 | http://dx.doi.org/10.7448/IAS.18.2.1983336specific interventions that address the age of consent aremore essential for this age group.ConclusionsDespite the dearth of age-specific data, YKP have significantnon-HIV-related health needs, and face significant obstaclesto accessing care as a result of their age and membershipof KP. While YKP face significant hardship and risk, they alsorepresent the greatest hope for reducing the harms associatedwith their behaviours, and preventing new HIV infections.Now that normative guidance exists for the optimal set ofinterventions for KP, priority needs to be placed on evaluat-ing optimal approaches for the delivery of a comprehensivepackage of care of YKP. Investments in providing linked, non-HIV but related services that also address critical enablersof programmes are likely to have significant benefits for HIVprevention across all populations.Authors’ affiliations1Wits RHI, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand,Johannesburg, South Africa; 2CeSHHAR Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe;3Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London,London, United Kingdom; 4Department of Population Health, London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; 5Centre for InfectiousDisease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Lusaka, ZambiaCompeting interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsAll authors contributed to the initial outline of the paper, and reviewed sectionsof the literature, and approved the initial submission.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adolescence is a time of physical, emotional and social transitions that have implications for health. In addition to being at high risk for HIV, young key populations (YKP) may experience other health problems attributable to high-risk behaviour or their developmental stage, or a combination of both. METHODS: We reviewed the needs, barriers and gaps for other non-HIV health services for YKP. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for articles that provided specific age-related data on sexual and reproductive health; mental health; violence; and substance use problems for adolescent, youth or young sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, and people who inject drugs. RESULTS: YKP experience more unprotected sex, sexually transmitted infections including HIV, unintended pregnancy, violence, mental health disorders and substance use compared to older members of key populations and youth among the general population. YKP experience significant barriers to accessing care; coverage of services is low, largely because of stigma and discrimination experienced at both the health system and policy levels. DISCUSSION: YKP require comprehensive, integrated services that respond to their specific developmental needs, including health, educational and social services within the context of a human rights-based approach. The recent WHO Consolidated Guidelines on HIV Prevention, Diagnosis, Treatment and Care for Key Populations are an important first step for a more comprehensive approach to HIV programming for YKP, but there are limited data on the effective delivery of combined interventions for YKP. Significant investments in research and implementation will be required to ensure adequate provision and coverage of services for YKP. In addition, greater commitments to harm reduction and rights-based approaches are needed to address structural barriers to access to care",
