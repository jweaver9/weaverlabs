This report documents the results of a survey designed to assess those efforts.  The survey and report are a modest attempt at examining the opinions, perceptions, and attitudes of USD faculty, staff, and students regarding Inclusive Excellence at the university. The initiative is intended to establish a benchmark for future surveys. The results are presented with minimal interpretation to allow the university community to analyze the data and come to their own conclusions. More data was collected than is presented in this report.  I hope this report encourages the USD community to examine other data that was collected related to diversity. Important dimensions such as microaggressions and disability were not analyzed and should be examined in future reports.  Requests for additional analysis should be submitted to the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness.  I would like to encourage all Deans and Vice Presidents to share the report with students, staff, and faculty in their areas.  The more the report is discussed at staff meetings, open forums, retreats, and other gatherings, the more likely we are to succeed in our efforts to improve the campus climate.  The document should be placed on the USD website in the interest of transparency and as a recruitment tool for new students, staff, and faculty.  Without the leadership and support of President Jim Abbott and Provost Jim Moran, we would not have been able to conduct this survey and would be unable to engage the campus community as effectively in our initiative of Inclusive Excellence at USD.  Thank you to them for enabling us to do this important work and for the continuing progress on Inclusive Excellence.  I also want to thank the members of the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness Subcommittee on the Campus Climate for Diversity Survey who co-authored the report.  I appreciate their efforts very much.  In addition, thanks to Dr.  Beth Boyd and Dr. Gerald Yutrzenka, co-chairs of the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness, as well as all members of the council for supporting the administration of the survey.  Special thanks to Dr. Sheilynda Stewart, Assistant Vice President, Office for Institutional Research, Planning and Assessment, and Lindsay Hayes, Coordinator of Student and Institutional Assessment for handling the data collection and analysis. I would also like to recognize Dr. Kelly McKay-Semmler, Associate Professor, Communication Studies; Eric Leise, Assistant Director, Center for Academic and Global Engagement; and Vanessa Carlson, Administrative Assistant, TRIO Programs and Associate, Office for Diversity for their assistance in the initial development of the survey instruments.  Tracy Chapman, Graduate Assistant, Office for Diversity created the majority of the tables for the report.  I am grateful for her contributions.  Finally, I want to thank Judy Jensen, Program Assistant, Office of Academic Affairs, for her support of this survey and the Office for Diversity.  Thank you.

To that end, USD has made progress in modifying the cultural, structural, and programmatic dimensions of the institution to promote diversity and inclusiveness. The university has made significant investments in both areas.  These included the creation of the Office for Diversity, Center for Diversity and Community, President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness, Gender Inclusive housing, Inclusive Excellence committees within our schools and colleges, various new student organizations, and other university-wide educational programs and initiatives.    While progress has been made, it is important to recognize that there is still much work to be done if we are to become the quintessential Inclusive Excellence institution for the 21st century.  Part of any strategic initiative involves the assessment of progress toward goals.  Thus, there is a need to find out in a broad way what USD students, faculty, and staff think about the work being done with diversity and inclusiveness.  With that in mind, during the 2015 fall semester, the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness began working to undertake a climate for diversity survey of the University of South Dakota.  A subcommittee of council and non-council members was created to develop the survey instruments.  The group identified three goals: 1) undertake a survey that would examine student, faculty, and staff perceptions and attitudes related to diversity and inclusiveness; 2) establish a bench mark for future surveys, and 3) offer a broad overview regarding the progress of Inclusive Excellence.  In the 2016 spring semester, the Campus Climate Survey was administered.  Some of the major findings include:   Overall responses indicate that roughly 60% across all three groups surveyed (students, faculty, and staff) perceive the climate to be inclusive.   Slightly less than 70% of respondents across all three university groups rated the climate as improving.  In the “No Change” category, approximately one-quarter of respondents across all groups perceive the climate as not changing or remaining the same.   In assessing the extent of racism in the climate, approximately 63% percent of students; 58% percent of staff; and 54% percent of faculty perceive the climate as non-racist.  In contrast, one in five faculty members (20.0%); approximately one in seven students (14.0%) and one in ten (11.0 %) staff members also perceive the climate as racist.   Slightly less than half of faculty respondents (48.6%) indicated that the climate is non-homophobic with larger percentages of staff (54.5%) and students (61%) reporting the   7 climate as such.     Approximately 50% of faculty respondents indicated that the climate is “non-sexist.”  In contrast, 56% percent of staff and 61% of students rated the climate as non-sexist.  Larger numbers of faculty (25.1%) as opposed to staff (16.0%) and students (16.6%) rated the climate as sexist.    Fewer students of color (Latino, Native American, Asian American, African American) than White students tend to rate the climate as inclusive.  For example, only 43.9% Students of Color indicated that the climate is inclusive as opposed to 58.8% of Multi/Biracial students and 66.2% of White students.   Fewer (range of 50% to 53%) Students of Color tend to assess the climate as non-racist; non-homophobic, and non-sexist as compared to White and International students (range of 67% to 73%).  Stated differently, White and International students tend to have a more positive view of the climate when assessing racism, homophobia, and sexism.   In examining students’ attitudes toward campus diversity, there appears to be strong support (97.2% to 100%) from Students of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International for USD working on increasing campus diversity. It is important to point out that Students of Color appear less satisfied (65.7%) with current diversity levels than White (82.5%) or International students (91.3%).    Almost half of the Students of Color surveyed (47.8%) also agreed that sexism is a problem at USD.     Large percentages of students (ranging from 71.2% to 91.4%) rejected the perception that LGBT+ members have only themselves to blame for discrimination directed at them.   Across the spectrum, Faculty of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International faculty agree that USD should be working toward the goal of increasing diversity.   In examining opinions about diversity in the academy, approximately 75% of White faculty members favor implementing a diversity course requirement for all USD students.  Approximately 30% of White faculty oppose considering diversity related work in tenure decisions.    In agreement, Staff of Color and White staff both rate the climate for diversity as inclusive at a rate of approximately 60%.  When comparing perceptions of exclusivity however, just below 30% of Staff of Color rated the campus climate as exclusive while only 5.4% of White staff rated it as such.     8  In examining perceptions of campus diversity, there is strong support across different groups for USD increasing diversity, student organizations for diverse communities, and more interaction with staff members from diverse backgrounds.    Analysis of the campus climate for diversity responses by gender does not reveal major differences in the way students or staff perceives dimensions of the climate. Both males and females rate the positive facets (e.g., inclusive, friendly, improving) of climate above 60.0%.  There are two exceptions.  First, staff responses differ by 10% in their perception of sexism in the climate for diversity.  That is, fifty-four percent of female staff rated the climate as non-sexist whereas a higher percentage of males (64.8%) suggested that the climate is non-sexist.     Female faculty consistently rated positive aspects of the campus climate lower than male faculty.  Approximately half of female faculty surveyed (49.5%) indicated that the climate is inclusive, in contrast with over two thirds of male faculty surveyed (70.3%).  With respect to sexism, 41% percent of female faculty suggested that the climate is non-sexist in contrast with 64% percent of male faculty.     LGBT+ students consistently rate the climate lower on most dimensions than heterosexual students.  For example, there is a 12% difference between LGBT+ and heterosexual students in the inclusive-exclusive ratings, with LGBT+ students rating the climate as more exclusive while heterosexual students rate the climate as more inclusive. Recommendations Overall, the quantitative and qualitative data suggests that the USD community is pleased with the strategic direction of the university in relation to diversity and inclusiveness.   Recommendation:  Continue to make investments in Inclusive Excellence including the hiring of a new Senior Diversity Officer who will continue the work of diversity and inclusiveness across the entire campus.  This includes continued funding for the Office for Diversity.   There are large percentages of students, staff, and faculty that rate the campus climate as “in between” or “no change.”  Stated differently, many USD constituents report experiencing both dimensions of the climate (e.g., inclusive and exclusive; non-sexist and sexist).    Recommendation:  Work to improve climates throughout the university including classrooms, residence halls, Student Union, and events.  To accomplish this, continue the Inclusive Excellence process of embedding diversity and inclusiveness in processes and procedures that govern the work of the university (e.g., curriculum, training, human resources, professional development for staff and faculty, athletics, marketing, admissions, etc.)  This will insure that students, staff (including Vice Presidents, Deans, and other administrators), and faculty are reminded to think about and practice inclusiveness.  In addition, continue training by staff from the Center for Diversity and Community, Center for Teaching and Learning, Human Resources,   9 and other USD entities will help to improve the climate for diversity.  One suggestion is that these entities come together to coordinate diversity and inclusiveness training.  Although overall students, staff, and faculty report that the climate is non-racist, there are still members of our community who express (ranging from 11.0% to 20%) that that climate is racist.  The same can be said of homophobia and sexism.  Recommendation:  Conduct focus groups with diverse communities to examine the perceptions of racism, sexism, and heterosexism that remain in the USD community. The same is true for students of color and their perceptions of the inclusiveness in the environment.  The goal is to gain a greater understanding of the problem in order to identify strategies and programs for ameliorating these issues.   There is large support from faculty for implementing a diversity course requirement for all USD students.    Recommendation:  Begin a dialogue among faculty and administrators about implementing a diversity requirement for students.  Diversity course requirements is one of the current trends across the country on college campuses primarily in response to diversity-related hate crimes and acts of insensitivity.  In addition, this is a core strategy for preparing students for practicing leadership in a diverse world and society. Female staff and faculty perceived the sexism on campus differently than male staff and faculty.  There is approximately a 30% gap between faculty females and faculty males in their perception of sexism in the climate for diversity with more females indicating that sexism is still a problem at USD.  Recommendation:  For a campus that has approximately 60 percent female in the student body, there are very little targeted initiatives or programs that support women and other gender identities. A Committee on the Status of Women, a women’s support center, a women’s faculty council, a staff women organization, and a women administrators group are all standard entities on most campuses across the country.  The campus community, particularly administrators, must began to think about instituting greater support for gender on campus in the way of new programs and initiatives.  One recommendation is to form a President’s Commission on the Status of Women at USD to make recommendations for improving the climate for women at USD as well as studying specific issues such as equal pay, promotions, leadership development opportunities, and representation in the STEM fields.   The Campus Climate Survey was undertaken to establish a benchmark for future surveys of the USD climate.  The current effort will serve as a point of comparison for assessment of the climate over time.  Recommendation:  The Campus Climate Survey should be conducted at minimum every three years.  If USD chooses to undertake a survey from a national organization (e.g., UCLA Higher Education Research Institute), some of the items on the current USD survey should be included in those instruments.   10  There is always the risk that the campus climate report will fall by the wayside and very little action will be taken on improving the campus climate for diversity.  It is critical that the report be disseminated throughout the entire campus and that action items be generated to improve the campus climate for diversity.  Recommendation:  Deans and Vice-Presidents should disseminate widely the campus climate report to be reviewed and discussed at staff meetings, retreats, open forums, and faculty meetings with the objective of generating action items to improve the climate for diversity.      11 INTRODUCTION  One of the hallmarks of a great university is its genuine commitment to excellence in research, teaching, and service to the community. An Inclusive Excellence (I.E.) university excels in these areas, but also values and practices inclusiveness, social justice, and equity as values that are embedded into the heart and soul of the institution. The concept of I.E. (articulated and endorsed by the Association of American Colleges and Universities) moves a university away from a simplistic definition of diversity to a more inclusive, comprehensive, and omnipresent notion of inclusiveness; melds inclusiveness and academic excellence into one concept (to practice inclusiveness is excellence); shifts the responsibility for diversity and inclusiveness to everyone on campus as opposed to one unit or department shouldering the responsibility; and moves an institution away from conceptualizing diversity only in terms of a numerical goal of diverse constituents. The focus becomes the transformation of a university into a vibrant community that embeds diversity and inclusiveness throughout the institution, including (but not limited to) demographics (numbers), curriculum, policies, enrollment, pedagogy, financial resources, diverse student learning outcomes, leadership, training, retention, student learning, marketing, technology, teaching, student advising, campus climate communications, administration, recruitment, hiring/promotion/tenure, assessment, institutional advancement, and evaluation. Inclusive Excellence employs a broad and inclusive definition of diversity that includes (but is not limited to) ability status, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, veteran status, and other important social dimensions that make up our campus community.  In sum, for the purpose of addressing inclusiveness at the University of South Dakota, “Inclusive Excellence is defined as a strategy for transforming USD into an institution that conceptualizes inclusiveness and excellence as one and the same, makes inclusiveness ubiquitous, assigns responsibility for inclusiveness to everyone on campus, and utilizes a broad definition of inclusiveness.”  One of the strategic goals of the University of South Dakota is to be a leader in the region in promoting and practicing Inclusive Excellence (I.E.).  In 2012, the university set out to fulfill that objective by introducing I.E. to the USD community and initiated the process of implementing I.E. throughout the institution.  Via the implementation of Inclusive Excellence, USD has made progress in modifying the cultural, structural, and programmatic dimensions of the institution to promote diversity and inclusiveness.  More specifically, USD has made significant investments in diversity, including the creation of the Office for Diversity, Center for Diversity and Community, President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness, Gender Inclusive housing, Inclusive Excellence committees within the schools and colleges, various new student organizations, and other university-wide educational programs and initiatives.  The success of Inclusive Excellence depends upon embedding the practice throughout the institution to ensure sustained and continuous progress.  To that end, I.E. has become an integral part of USD’s strategic plan, mission and values, human resources, departmental policies, staff/faculty/administration training, marketing, student academic pledge, scholarship awards, and multiple other areas and processes.  These successes contribute to the ultimate objective of restructuring the institution to assist in the preparation of students to succeed in an increasingly   12 diverse local and global society.  While progress has been made, it is important to recognize that there is still much work to be done if USD is to become the quintessential Inclusive Excellence institution for the 21st century.  As the University moves forward as an institution that aspires toward Inclusive Excellence, USD must consistently send the message that it welcomes and values all social and personal dimensions of identity including, but not limited to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, nationality, ability status, veteran status, age, religion, and gender identity and expression.   Any successful strategic initiative involves the assessment of progress toward goals.  Thus, there is a need to uncover what USD students, faculty, and staff think about the work of diversity and inclusiveness.  With that in mind, during the fall semester of 2015, the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness decided to administer a climate for diversity survey of the University of South Dakota.  A subcommittee of council and non-council members was created to develop the survey instruments.  The subcommittee identified three goals: 1) undertake a survey that would examine student, staff, and faculty perceptions and attitudes related to diversity and inclusiveness; 2) establish a bench mark for future surveys, and 3) offer a broad overview regarding the progress of Inclusive Excellence.  The results of the USD Campus Climate for Diversity are presented in this document.  First, the methodology for the initiative is presented.  This is followed by overall student, staff, and faculty results.  Finally, Appendices reflect the qualitative findings and the instruments that were utilized to conduct the survey.  The qualitative results are presented in original form, in large part as survey participants reported them.  Some comments have been edited due to length or identifying content, but still reflect the main idea the individual aimed to convey.  The data analysis presented uses basic statistics with minimal interpretation to present a broad picture of the campus climate for diversity.  The reader is encouraged to come to their own conclusions and recommendations for change.  Conclusions about the data should take into consideration that some of the response rates are small.  In addition, the “Multi/Biracial” category was separated within the racial categories.  That also impacts the results.  Some variables included in the survey were not analyzed (e.g., ability status, microaggressions, size of home town, Greek affiliation, Athletes, academic area, etc.) for this report, in some cases because of negligible differences between groups.  If interested, you may request those analyses from the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness. Analyses should be requested from the President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness.      13 METHODOLOGY  Survey Instrument The survey items were constructed by the USD President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness Sub-Committee on the Campus Climate for Diversity Survey.  Most sections were adapted from previously validated sections from the University of Denver Campus Climate survey, but some were created specifically for the University of South Dakota (USD).  The President’s Council on Diversity and Inclusiveness at USD reviewed several drafts of the student, faculty, and staff.  Climate for Diversity surveys to be clearly and broadly understood in eliciting responses from the populations surveyed. The final USD Climate for Diversity surveys contained the following campus-specific items:  the student survey contained 113 quantitative questions, the faculty survey contained 100 quantitative questions, and the staff survey contained 91 quantitative questions.  Each survey included one open-ended question about aspects related to diversity at USD.  A few questions in the background section contained an “Other” textbox where participants could expand by adding additional comments.  Survey items were grouped into the following sections:  1) Assessment of the Climate for Diversity, 2) Attitudes, 3) Knowledge of Diversity at USD, 4) Microaggressions, 5) Microaffirmations, 6) Diversity in the Classroom, and 7) Background questions included at the end of the survey.  The survey was designed to collect data about student, faculty, and staff experiences, attitudes, and perceptions about diversity and inclusiveness.    Each student, faculty, and staff survey invitation included the purpose of the study, pledge of anonymity, and assurance that survey participants could withdraw from the survey at any point or decline to respond to any question.  Data from the open-ended question were separated from the raw data and compiled to maintain anonymity.  Survey Administration This climate for diversity survey allowed us to take the temperature of the students, faculty, and staff on campus about topics regarding diversity, culture, practices, norms, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and ability status.  The surveys were administered online using Question Pro software using a secure site database.  The survey administration was open between January 21, 2016 and February 24, 2016.    Survey participants received an email invitation with an embedded link that redirected them to the survey.  All students, faculty, and staff who had not yet taken the survey were sent three reminders.  The link contained a personal identifier which allowed participants to complete the survey at different points in time and track survey response rates.  In addition, the link embedded in the student surveys automatically entered them into a drawing for a $100 prize for completion of the survey.  All students had an equal chance of being selected for a $100 prize.  Following the drawing, the personal identifier was deleted from the raw data so that these identifiers could not be linked back to survey responses.  The median time to complete the survey was 15-20 minutes.  Sampling Procedure   All undergraduate and graduate students who were enrolled during the Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 semesters were invited to participate in the USD Climate for Diversity survey.  All faculty   14 and staff who were employed at USD during the Spring 2016 semester were invited to participate in the survey as well.  The data collected from the USD Climate for Diversity survey was used for assessment and institutional effectiveness purposes.  As a result, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) acknowledged that the survey research was not subject to IRB approval.     Limitations  All students, faculty, and staff were invited to participate in the survey.  The first limitation is that participation in the survey was completely voluntary which could result in self-selection bias.  Since an individual’s decision to participate or not participate was voluntary, this may correlate with behaviors and/or perceptions that affect survey outcomes.  For example, students, faculty, and staff with strong attitudes about diversity and inclusiveness may have been motivated to participate in the study.  Data Analysis   Survey responses were compiled and analyzed using SPSS (version 23) software.  Descriptive statistics were calculated by various groups (race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and individuals with disability impairments) to provide information about participant responses.  The data tables within the narrative were presented using valid percentages, where missing data were excluded.  The “Other” option was available for a few questions in the background section allowing survey participants to provide contextual information about their experiences.  Data from the open-ended comment included in the survey were compiled and categorized into systematic groups with common themes.   Response Rates   Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to 666 faculty, 2,958 staff, and 9,281 students.   The total number of faculty, staff, and students responding to the survey were 221 (33%), 421 (14%), and 1,012 (11%), respectively.  Respondents were not required to answer any particular question and some respondents skipped some of the questions.   Tables 1 through 6 present response rates for faculty, staff, and students by gender and race/ethnicity.  The demographic analysis by race/ethnicity show response rates for faculty, students, and staff grouped by persons of color (Black/African American (not of Hispanic origin), Native American/American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic/Latino American), Multiracial/Biracial, White/Euro-American (not of Hispanic origin), and International origin.   Table 1 presents response rates from the survey for faculty by gender.  Response rates for male and female faculty participants were underrepresented in the sample at 29% and 28%, respectively.  Overall, 33% of the faculty members responded to the Climate for Diversity survey.    Table 1.

Response rates by gender were self-reported by the survey respondent.  Responses less than 6 were included in the “Other/LGBT+/No Response” category to protect the anonymity of the participants.  Table 2 presents response rates from the survey for faculty by race/ethnicity.  Faculty of Color were overrepresented (23%) in the sample compared to White/Euro-American (not of Hispanic origin) faculty who were underrepresented (24%) in the sample.  The Multiracial/Biracial, International, and Other/Unknown were overrepresented in the sample and self-supported responses on the survey, but were not reported in the population.  Table 2.

Table 3 present response rates for staff by gender.  Response rates for male and female staff participants were underrepresented in the sample at 11% and 12%, respectively.  Overall, 14% of the staff members responded to the Climate for Diversity survey.     Table 3.

The response rate for Staff of Color was 7% compared to 11% for White/Euro-American (not of Hispanic origin) staff participants.  Both of these groups were underrepresented in the sample.  The Multiracial/Biracial, International, and Other/Unknown groups were overrepresented self-supported responses on the survey, but were not reported in the population.  Table 4.

Table 5 presents response rates for students by gender.  Response rates for male and female student participants were underrepresented in the sample at 7% and 9%, respectively.  Overall, 11% of students responded to the Climate for Diversity survey.    Table 5.

Table 6 presents response rates from the survey for students by race/ethnicity.  Response rates for students of color were representative of the sample (%), whereas the Multiracial/Biracial, International, and Other/Unknown groups were overrepresented in the sample.  The White/Euro-American (not of Hispanic origin) students were underrepresented in the sample.  The race/ethnicity self-identity of 263 students was not reported in the survey.  Table 6.

Response rates by race/ethnicity were self-reported by the survey respondent.  Responses less than 6 were included in the “Other” category to protect the anonymity of the participants.  Response rates for students differed across gender and race demographics when compared to the demographics of the student population.  Therefore, the results of the survey should be interpreted as representative of the survey respondents and not generalized to the USD student population as a whole.     Table 7 shows the demographic profile of the undergraduate and graduate student body with student survey respondents.  The proportion of students by gender in the sample is somewhat overrepresented when compared to the population.  However, both the student sample and population group are closely mirrored within race/ethnicity and class levels.  The proportion of full-time students in the sample group are overrepresented whereas part-time students are underrepresented compared to the population.  Table 7.

The overall responses (See Table 8) indicate that roughly 60% across all three groups (students, staff, and faculty) perceive the climate to be inclusive.  In contrast, more students (15.1%) perceive the climate to be exclusive in comparison to 9.2% of staff and 10.5% of faculty.  Approximately 25% of students, 29% of staff, and 30% of faculty perceive that the climate is neither inclusive nor exclusive.  Stated differently, more than one quarter of all three groups perceive that both dimensions (inclusive and exclusive) of the climate exist at USD.  Approximately seven in ten students (71.5%); staff (74.2%); and faculty (72.1%) respectively rate the climate for diversity as “friendly.”  And once again, more students (14.6%) than staff (7.9%) or faculty (9.1%) rate the climate as unfriendly.  Approximately 13% of students, 17.9% of staff, and 18.7% of faculty rated the climate as neither friendly nor unfriendly (i.e., “in between”).  Slightly less than seven in ten (66.1% to 69.8%) respondents across all three university groups rated the climate as improving.  More students (12.0%) than staff (4.1%) or faculty (6.0%) suggests that the climate is worsening.  In the “No Change” category, approximately one quarter of respondents across all groups perceive the climate as neither improving nor worsening.  In assessing the extent of racism in the climate, approximately 63% of students; 58% of staff; and 44% of faculty perceive the climate as non-racist.  In contrast, one in five faculty (20.0%) rate the climate as racist; approximately one in seven students (14.0%) indicate the same, and one in ten staff (11.0 %) also suggest that the climate is racist.  Less than 30% of staff and faculty alike, as well as 22.4% students reported the climate to be neither racist nor non-racist.  Survey respondents were also asked to rate the campus climate in regards to homophobia.  Slightly less than half of faculty respondents (48.6%) indicated that the climate is non-homophobic with larger percentages of staff (54.5%) and students (61%) reporting the climate as such.  Approximately 11% of staff; 14% of students; and 17% of faculty rated the climate as homophobic.  Approximately half of faculty (51.6%) respondents indicated that the climate is non-sexist.  In contrast, 56% of staff and 61% of students rated the climate as non-sexist.  Larger numbers of faculty (25.1%) in comparison to staff (16.0%) and students (16.6%), rated the climate as sexist.  Larger numbers of staff (28.0%) in comparison to students (21.3%) and faculty (23.3%) perceive the climate to be neither sexist nor non-sexist.    Table 8.

Fewer Students of Color (Latino, Native American, Asian American, and African American students) compared to White students tend to rate the climate as inclusive.  For example, only 43.9% Students of Color indicated that the climate is inclusive as opposed to 58.8% Multi/Biracial and 64.4% White students.  Approximately 7 in 10 international students rate the climate as inclusive.  Approximately 15% percent of Students of Color suggest that the climate is exclusive and 41% see both dimensions (inclusive and exclusive) manifested in the climate.  High percentages of all four groups report that the climate is friendly range (between 65.3% and 78.3%). White, Multiracial, and International students tend to describe the climate as improving rather than worsening.  Only 56.5% of Students of Color indicated that the climate is improving.  Less (range of 50% to 56.1%) Students of Color assess the climate as non-racist; non-homophobic, and non-sexist as compared to White and International students (range of 67% to 78.3%).   Stated differently, White and International students tend to have a more positive view of the climate when assessing racism, homophobia, and sexism.  Table 9.

For the purposes of this table, 1’s and 2’s were combined into the first dimension (e.g., inclusive), 4’s and 5’s were combined into the latter dimension (e.g., exclusive), and 3’s were designated as “in between” or “no change” categories  Student Attitudes Students were asked to respond to attitudinal items on the survey designed to assess attitudes regarding diversity on campus and on issues of fairness and equity with respect to specific groups (See Table 10).  In examining student’s attitudes toward campus diversity, there appears to be strong support (94.3% to 100%) from Students of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International students for USD working on increasing campus diversity.  In regards to satisfaction with the current level of diversity, most students expressed high levels of satisfaction.  Students of Color appear less satisfied (65.7%) with current diversity levels than White (82.5%) or International students (91.3%).  These findings and others above suggest that students broadly disagree with the notion that student organizations formed in support of different communities represented on campus promote segregation.   One item that appears to contradict the findings above is related to the perception that emphasizing diversity leads to greater divisiveness.  Although there is support for greater campus diversity, between 71.4% and 82.6% across all four groups agree with the notion that diversity contributes to divisions among groups on campus.  This could be interpreted in several ways.  First, it may suggest that students realize what existing research literature confirms that differences often lead to conflict rather than harmony.  Second, students may simply be indicating that emphasis on diversity negates our similarities and that leads to conflict.  The bottom line seems to be that students value diversity and want more of it, but we need to be more attentive to promoting positive and authentic intergroup relations on campus.  Table 10. Student Attitudes on Campus Diversity by Race Statement Students of Color (N=71) Multi/ Biracial (N=35) White (N=605) International (N=23) Emphasizing diversity leads to greater divisiveness.

Agree 88.7% 94.3% 89.2% 100.0% Disagree 11.3% 5.7% 10.8% 0.0%  Student Perceptions of Fairness and Equity Students were also surveyed on their attitudes related to fairness and equity in relation to different groups.  Part of diversity work on a college campus involves change which is mediated by resistance engendered by perceptions about fairness and equity.  If majority populations perceive diversity strategies as unfair, members of those groups will resist change.  Thus, it was important to survey the campus regarding attitudes about fairness.  In regards to racial equity and fairness, (See Table 11) students largely agreed that there are equal opportunities for all racial groups to do well at USD (60.0%); disagreed with the notion that discrimination against Whites is a problem (72.6% and greater); and disagreed that Students of Color have an unfair advantage in the USD admissions process (73% or more).  In sum, the collective message from students is that racial unfairness and inequities are not an issue at USD.   The only item that elicited disagreement is related to employment.  Close to half of Students of Color (46.4%) and over half of International students (54.5%) agreed that USD employers are less likely to choose a candidate of color when faced with two equally qualified individuals (one of them being White).  Only 24.1% of White respondents agreed that White candidates have an unfair advantage in an equal hiring situation.    Almost half of Students of Color (47.8%) also agreed that sexism is a problem at USD.  More than 70% of students rejected the notion that age discrimination is an issue at USD.  Large percentages of students (ranging from 71.2% to 91.4%) rejected the notion that LGBT+ members have only themselves to blame for discrimination directed at them.  Table 11.

The results indicate that Faculty of Color and International faculty members consistently rated all positive dimensions of the climate at higher percentages than White faculty members.  For example, 70% of Faculty of Color rate the climate as inclusive in comparison to 58% of White faculty members.  Approximately 60% of International faculty rate the climate as inclusive.  Additionally, a large percentage of Faculty of Color (87.5%) indicate that the climate is improving.  In contrast, only 70% of White faculty members believe that the climate is improving.  Approximately, 17% of Faculty of Color and White faculty members rate the climate for diversity as racist.  Overall, Faculty of Color, White, and International faculty gave high ratings on the positive (e.g., inclusive, friendly, non-racist) dimensions of the campus climate.  Table 12.

Across the spectrum, Faculty of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International faculty members agree that USD should be working toward the goal of increasing diversity.  Both Faculty of Color (94.1%) and White faculty (87.8%) do not support the notion that marginalized student organizations promote segregation.  Similar to students, faculty across all groups would like opportunities to interact with faculty members who are different from them.  Table 13.

White faculty and Faculty of Color are split (approximately 50/50) in their responses to the item regarding the presence of sexism on campus.  Table 14.

Diversity in the Academy In examining opinions about diversity in the academy, approximately three-quarters of White faculty members favor implementing a diversity course requirement for all USD students (See Table 15).  Approximately 30% of White faculty oppose considering diversity related work in tenure decisions.

Often some faculty members from specific disciplines believe that diversity has nothing to do with their subject matter.  Anytime people are involved (e.g., students, staff, faculty) in any discipline, than diversity is pertinent.    30 Staff Results  Assessment of the Campus Climate for Diversity by Race Staff of Color and White staff rate the climate for diversity as inclusive at a rate of approximately 60% or greater (Table 16).  On the other hand, slightly less than 30% of Staff of Color indicated that the campus climate is exclusive (as opposed to 5.4% for White staff).  The dimension of a friendly and improving campus climate also registers a somewhat similar pattern.  Staff differences are reflected when considering whether the climate is racist.  Approximately 40% of Staff of Color suggested that the climate is non-racist in comparison to 65% of White staff members.  Table 16.

Similar to students, there is no clear cut agreement regarding the notion that diversity leads to greater divisiveness.  Here, 52% of Staff of Color agree with the aforementioned idea and 47% disagree. About 17% of White staff members agree that diversity leads to divisiveness and   31 approximately 30% of White staff disagree with this notion.  Between 68% and 71% of Staff of Color, White, and International staff report satisfaction with the current level of diversity at USD.  Table 17.

Between 80% to 86% of those groups suggested that race is not a factor in succeeding at USD; ethnic/racial minority students do not have an unfair advantage in the admissions process, and that age discrimination is not a problem at USD.  Over 80% of all staff groups disagree that members of the LGBT+ community have only themselves to blame for discrimination directed at them.  When considering employment, 50% of Staff of Color agree that USD employers are less likely to choose an ethnic/racial person when deciding between two qualified candidates.  Approximately 40% of White staff members and 30% of Staff of Color agree that sexism is still a problem at USD. Table 18.

(see Table 19)  Both males and females rated the positive facets (e.g., inclusive, friendly, improving) of climate above 60.0%.  However, when it comes to perceptions of sexism on campus, staff responses by gender differ by 10%.  That is, 54% of female staff rated the climate as non-sexist whereas a higher percentage of males (64.8%) suggested that the climate is non-sexist.  Another difference is revealed in analysis of faculty responses by gender.  For each of the dimensions of the climate for diversity, female faculty consistently rated the climate on each of the dimensions lower than male faculty.  Approximately half of female faculty (49.5%) indicated that the climate is inclusive as opposed to male faculty (70.3%).  With respect to sexism. 41% of females indicated that the climate is non-sexist in contrast to 64% of males.    Table 19.

While the perceptions on the positive side cross the threshold of 50%, in general the student ratings are lower compared to overall results (Table 8) and assessment by race (Table 9).  Moreover, LGBT+ students consistently rate the climate lower on most dimensions than heterosexual students.  For example, there is a 12% difference between LGBT+ and heterosexual students in the inclusive-exclusive ratings.  There are large percentages of students who are in between and see both aspects of each of the dimensions of the climate.  Table 20.

In contrast, more students (15.1%) perceive the climate to be exclusive in comparison to roughly 10% of staff and faculty.    Slightly less than seven in ten respondents across all three university groups rated the climate as improving. In the “No Change” category, approximately one-quarter of respondents across all groups perceive the climate as not changing or remaining the same.   In assessing the extent of racism in the climate, approximately 63% percent of students; 58% percent of staff; and 54% percent of faculty perceive the climate as non-racist.  In contrast, one in five faculty members (20.0%); approximately one in seven students (14.0%) and one in ten (11.0 %) staff members also perceive the climate as racist.   Slightly less than half of faculty respondents (48.6%) indicated that the climate is non-homophobic with larger percentages of staff (54.5%) and students (61%) reporting the climate as such.     Approximately half of faculty respondents indicated that the climate is “Non-sexist”.  In contrast, fifty-six percent of staff and sixty-one percent of students rated the climate as non-sexist.  Larger numbers of faculty (25.1%) as opposed to staff (16.0%) and students (16.6%), rated the climate as sexist.    Fewer Students of Color (Latino, Native American, Asian American, and African American) compared to White students tend to rate the climate as inclusive.  For example, only 43.9% Students of Color indicated that the climate is inclusive as opposed to 58.8% Multi/Biracial and 66.2% White students   Less (range of 50% to 53%) Students of Color assess the climate as non-racist; non-homophobic, and non-sexist as compared to White and International students (range of 67% to 73%).   Stated differently, White and International students tend to have a more positive view of the climate when assessing racism, homophobia, and sexism.   In examining student’s attitudes towards campus diversity, there appears to be strong support (97.2% to 100%) from Students of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International students for USD working on increasing campus diversity.  Although it is important to point out that Students of Color appear less satisfied (65.7%) with current diversity levels than White (82.5%) or International students (91.3%).    36   Almost half of the Students of Color (47.8%) also agreed that sexism is a problem at USD.  Overall, students rejected the notion (70% or greater) that age discrimination is an issue at USD.  Large percentages of students (ranging from 71.2% to 91.4%) rejected the notion that LGBT+ members have only themselves to blame for discrimination directed at them.   With respect to faculty attitudes on campus diversity, Faculty of Color and White faculty disagree in approximately equal percentages (60%) with the notion that emphasizing diversity leads to greater divisiveness.  Across the spectrum, Faculty of Color, Multi/Biracial, White, and International faculty agree that USD should be working toward the goal of increasing diversity.   In examining opinions about diversity in the academy, approximately 75% of White faculty members favor implementing a diversity course requirement for all USD students.  Approximately 30% of White faculty members oppose considering diversity related work in tenure decisions.   Staff of Color and White staff rate the climate for diversity as inclusive at a rate of approximately 60% or greater.  On the other hand, slightly less than 30% of Staff of Color indicated that the campus climate is exclusive as opposed to 5.4% of White staff.  40% of Staff of Color indicated that the climate is non-racist in comparison to 65% of White staff members.   In examining perceptions of campus diversity, there is strong support across different groups for USD increasing diversity, student organizations for diverse communities, and greater interaction with staff members from diverse backgrounds. About one in six White staff members agree that diversity leads to divisiveness and approximately three in ten disagree.   Analysis of the campus climate for diversity responses by gender does not reveal major differences in the way students or staff perceives dimensions of the climate. Both males and females rate the positive facets (e.g., inclusive, friendly, improving) of climate above 60.0%.  There are two exceptions.  First, staff responses differ by 10% in their perception of sexism in the climate for diversity.  That is, fifty-four percent of female staff rated the climate as non-sexist whereas a higher percentage of males (64.8%) suggested that the climate is non-sexist.     For each of the dimensions of the climate for diversity, female faculty consistently rate the climate on each of the dimensions lower than male faculty.  Approximately half of female faculty (49.5%) indicated that the climate is inclusive while far more male faculty (70.3%) rated it as such.  With respect to sexism, 41% of female faculty suggested that the climate is non-sexist in contrast to 64% of male faculty.     37   LGBT+ students consistently rate the climate lower on most dimensions than heterosexual students.  For example, there is a 12% difference between LGBT+ and heterosexual students in the inclusive-exclusive ratings.     38 Recommendations  There is plenty of good news emerging from the results of the campus climate survey.  There appears to be strong support for the direction that USD is taking in implementing Inclusive Excellence and the attentiveness to diversity and inclusiveness.   Nevertheless, there are also areas that require attention.   Below are recommendations emerging from the findings of the survey.  Overall, the quantitative and qualitative data suggest that the USD community is pleased with the strategic direction of the university in relation to diversity and inclusiveness.  The USD community agrees with the investments that the administration have undertaken to address diversity and inclusiveness (e.g., Center for Diversity and Community, Office for Diversity, Senior Diversity Officer, cultural student organizations).  Clearly, the university is in transition with over half of students, staff, and faculty rating aspects of the climate for diversity as positive.  Recommendation:  Continue to make investments in Inclusive Excellence including the hiring of a new Senior Diversity Officer who will continue the work of diversity and inclusiveness across the entire campus.  This includes continued funding for the Office for Diversity.   Despite the positive news, there are areas where the university needs to improve.  There are large percentages of students, staff, and faculty that rate the campus climate as “in between” or “no change.”  Stated differently, many USD constituents report experiencing both dimensions of the climate explored in the survey.  For example, many see the climate as both inclusive and exclusive; friendly and unfriendly; or sexist and non-sexist.  Given that USD is attempting to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment, the above suggest that there is still work to be done so that those individuals experience and report more positive experiences.  Recommendation:  Work to improve climates throughout the university including classrooms, residence halls, Student Union, and events.  To accomplish this, continue the Inclusive Excellence process of embedding diversity and inclusiveness in processes and procedures that govern the work of the University (e.g., curriculum, training, human resources, professional development for staff and faculty, athletics, marketing, admissions, etc.)  This will insure that students, staff (including Vice Presidents, Deans, and other administrators), and faculty are reminded to think about and practice inclusiveness.  In addition, continued training by staff from the Center for Diversity and Community, Center for Teaching and Learning, Human Resources, and other USD entities will help to improve the climate for diversity.  One suggestion is that these entities come together to coordinate diversity and inclusiveness training.  Although overall students, staff, and faculty report that the climate is non-racist, there are still members of our community who express (ranging from 11.0% to 20%) that the climate is racist.  The same can be said of homophobia and sexism.  Recommendation:  Conduct focus groups with diverse communities to examine the perceptions of racism, sexism, and heterosexism that remain in the USD community. The same is true for students of color and their perceptions of inclusiveness in the environment.  The goal is to gain a greater understanding of the problem in order to identify strategies and programs for   39 ameliorating these issues.   There is large support for implementing a diversity course requirement for all USD students.    Recommendation:  Begin a dialogue among faculty and administrators about implementing a diversity requirement for students.  A diversity course requirement is one of the current trends across the country on college campuses primarily in response to diversity-related hate crimes and acts of insensitivity.  In addition, this is a core strategy for preparing students for practicing leadership in a diverse world and society. Female staff and faculty perceived the sexism on campus differently than male staff and faculty.  There is approximately a 30% gap between faculty females and faculty males in their perception of sexism in the climate for diversity with more females indicating that sexism is still a problem at USD.  Recommendation:  For a campus that has approximately 60 percent female in the student body, there are very little targeted initiatives or programs that support women and other gender identities. A Committee on the Status of Women, a women’s support center, a women’s faculty council, a staff women organization, and a women administrators group are all standard entities on most campuses across the country.  The campus community, particularly administrators, must began to think about instituting greater support for gender on campus in the way of new programs and initiatives.  One recommendation is to form a President’s Commission on the Status of Women at USD to make recommendations for improving the climate for women at USD as well as studying specific issues such as equal pay, promotions, leadership development opportunities, and representation in the STEM fields.   The Campus Climate Survey was undertaken to establish a benchmark for future surveys of the USD climate.  The current effort will serve as a point of comparison for assessment of the climate over time.  Recommendation:  The Campus Climate Survey should be conducted at minimum every three years.  If USD chooses to undertake a survey from a national organization (e.g., UCLA Higher Education Research Institute), some of the items on the current USD survey should be included in those instruments.  There is always the risk that the campus climate report will fall by the wayside and very little action will be taken on improving the campus climate for diversity.  It is critical that the report be disseminated throughout the entire campus and that action items be generated to improve the campus climate for diversity.  Recommendation:  Deans and Vice-Presidents should disseminate widely the campus climate report to be reviewed and discussed at staff meetings, retreats, open forums, and faculty meetings with the objective of generating action items to improve the climate for diversity.        40       90   APPENDIX B  USD CLIMATE FOR DIVERSITY STUDENT SURVEY   Hello: You are invited to participate in USD's Climate for Diversity student survey.
