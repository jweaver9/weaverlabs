Lagman 2022. All rights reserved   iii Abstract A graduate student in art therapy wrote this heuristic paper to explore shame's role as both a negative internal feeling and a cultural and social tool for evaluating and regulating behavior. As a transgender woman, she examines what it is like to be labeled as Filipino and deal with being transgender. Tiny advances have been made in the understanding of shame within the context of minority transgender self-research. Using art to expose those feelings associated with shame, balance them with affirmations, and ground them in native identity are key aspects of this process. Consequently, meeting one's shadow becomes a necessity for self-acceptance. There is a discussion about the potential to readapt the exploratory process into a card game for art therapy.   iv Acknowledgements I would like to acknowledge the support of my family: Mom, Sunny, Ted, Cheska, Tin, and little Atreyu, Banner & Stark.

Transgender people experience unjust hardship, microaggressions on a daily basis, and ill treatment at both the micro and macro levels within their own families, as well as within institutions such as schools, police, and health care (Virupaksha, et al., 2016). In both populations, suicide rates are high, highlighting the importance of mental health and the need to understand transgender people and Filipinos. Across countries, transgender people commit suicide at a rate of 32% to 50% (Virupaksha, et al., 2016). According to the President's advisory commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in 2001, Filipino adolescents are more likely to attempt suicide than any other group in the United States (David, 2013). The student researcher hopes the information gained from this experience will be beneficial to transgendered individuals and Filipinos like themselves in seeking meaning, understanding, and representation of transgender Filipinos in the field of art therapy in the future. Furthermore, being Filipino-American and transgender female entailed overcoming the debilitating shame obstructing self-authenticity on the part of the student researcher. The DSM-V characterizes the distress felt from the “incongruence” of one’s “assigned” gender to the gender one experiences and identifies with as gender dysphoria (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A third-person perspective will be used to describe and introduce the research in Chapters 1 to 4. In Chapter 5, the student researcher will use first-person voice to emphasize lived experience. This paper connects the intersectionality of shame as it pertains to gender dysphoria across subject disciplines, and the need for acceptance as a theme of development in the 2 researchers’ life.  As the patterns of shame and the motivations to free oneself of its condition become apparent to the researcher, it is noteworthy to add self-psychology as a form of psychoanalysis to understand and make sense of the past to mitigate impediments such as avoidance and self-loathing generated from shame.  Subsequently, integrating transpersonal and narrative art therapy will be conducive in holistically treating the existential concepts that present themselves as they arise. Intersectionality Being a Filipino American immigrant who is transgender, it is important for the student researcher to highlight the framework of intersectionality in identity. “Intersectionality,” coined by Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw in 1989, analyzes the different factors that overlap in an individual’s identity that illustrate privilege and/or oppression (as cited in Cooper, 2016).  The designation of “Filipino” has been regarded as problematic since its inception as a painful reminder of being enslaved under the Spanish conquest of King Philip II enacted by Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan (Nadal, 2021).  Furthermore, the term Filipino is often regarded as neither masculine or feminine by Filipinos because the native language inherently does not use masculine or feminine signifiers but rather use “siya” in singular reference to he or she (Nadal, 2021, pg.9).  Rather alternately, “Filipina” was commonly used by Filipina American women overseas as the term gradually grew with leading female academic writers (Nadal. 2021); whereas pinoy and pinay were often used by modern Filipino expatriates politically or as a term of endearment (Nadal, 2021, pp.8,9).  Nadal (2021) further states that recently Filipinx was introduced by Filipino Americans as a way for gender-inclusivity overlooking the general orientation of Filipinos from the Philippines because the pre-colonial alphabet does not have either letters F or X (pp.8,9).  Following Nadal’s initiative, “Filipino,” in this paper acceptably 3 refers to people originating from the Philippines and the diaspora while “Filipino-American '' and “Filipinx” associates those born in the United States.  Further individual exploration into the meaning of identity as a transgender Filipino American will be addressed by excavating past artwork that connects the researcher’s dealing with shame.  The researcher would like to address the use of first-person singular subject pronoun of I and object pronoun of me in recognizing the heuristic experience.  Personal pronouns respecting dual heritage of Filipino “bakla” or “babaylan” and American transgender female are culturally respected with the appropriate use of she, her, they, and “siya” importantly signifying the researcher’s preferred terms in the United States as well as the non-binary official language of Tagalog; and the accepted use of “Filipino” as an umbrella term that adopts pinay, chinay, mestizo, as well as diverse dialects as parts of the multicultural history and unique affinities reflecting the nation’s ecosystem of more than 7,100 islands in the Pacific.  In the United States, however, Filipinos were among the first Asians earliest written to have been shipwrecked in California within the mid-1500s as hispanicized crewmembers (Gomez Borah, 1995) and as slaves in Louisiana in the mid-1700s.  Yet throughout history, Filipinos are both regarded as “forgotten Asian Americans” and “invisible minority” even by the psychological community (David, 2013, pg.37). The Minority Stress Theory states that the disparities in mental illness are caused by the extreme exposure to society’s stigmatization affecting gender nonconforming people distally through discrimination and proximally through internalized transphobia. Society’s violence and oppression towards gender nonconformity leads to mental illness yet finding ways to protect the mental health of those discriminated by transphobia remains under researched (Sacandurra, et al., 2018). 4 Figure 1 Pronoun Differences  Purpose of Study The purpose of this study is two-fold: first is to bring social awareness to the erasure and invisibility of the ancient sacredness of a third gender (“bakla” roughly translated in English to “trans-female” or an effeminate homosexual) casually misunderstood by westernized cisgendered people as observation from a “new development” is deeply rooted in fear (transphobia) and perpetuated shame. First coined and addressed by Julia Serrano in the Trans Woman Manifesto (2007), transmisogyny is “when the majority of anti-trans discrimination, ridicule, exclusion and violence is against trans women and trans feminine people, it is not transphobia, it is transmisogyny…” originating from toxic masculine ideals and the Patriarchy (Choudrey, 2022, 109-110).  It is the researcher’s memories of oppression primarily from being bullied that contextualizes “bakla” as derogatory just as conversely the anglicized “tom-boy” was meant for Filipino fourth gendered “trans-males,” or lesbians who were perceived as masculine.  Unlike the English counterpart to homosexual or pejorative faggot, bakla was corrupted over time adapted to western attitudes toward effeminacy (Manalansan, 2015).  Secondly, it is their 5 objective to pursue a path for self-acceptance and promote positive changes in the acceptance of Filipino transgenders as spiritual descendants of native healers and caregivers who were intrinsic and beneficial to their societies.  This heuristic aspect of the research is predicated upon the need for a transgender Filipino voice unobjectified by the colonial push for expansion but rather as an individual call to participation within the community and the importance of understanding cultural perspective in psychology. Research Questions and Assumptions This research study addresses the question: can art therapy alleviate feelings of shame derived from a history of cultural mistreatment?  Further questions are investigated: ● First Inquiry: Can the symptoms of incongruence from gender dysphoria be exacerbated or tied with incongruence of cultural expectations?  ● Second Inquiry: How do the perceptions of race and gender from culture affect the outcome of shame? ● Third Inquiry: How does the outcome of shame affect gender dysphoria? ● Fourth Inquiry: How can art be used to identify and treat shame and identity?   6 Chapter II: Literature Review Colonial Mentality Frantz Fanton (1965) divides the colonial model of oppression by four phases: first is forced entry with the intention to exploit, second is “imposing culture” by destroying the sense of self, the third is rationalized brutality as a form of civilizing, and the fourth is implementing institutions to perpetually take advantage and maintain supremacy over the subjugated (David, 2013).  Finally, the inhumane treatment over generations of Filipinos by the Spanish and even Americans have formed an inferiority complex characterized by gaslighting, self-doubt, and loss of identity as David (2013) recounts both inferiorizing and discrimination during their occupation of the Philippines and toward Filipinos abroad (p.26). Native Filipinos who were egalitarian before being colonized learned Patriarchy and machismo from the Spanish, and capitalism and competition from the Americans (Nadal, 2021, 114-115). Echoed in experiences among Filipinos, is internalized oppression as David (2013) relates from personal experience that anything made or coming from the United States is more valuable. For example, being from America, an American, or even a Filipino American citizen confers higher value than being just a commoner: the need to “shed oneself of anything from his/her heritage culture and ethnicity because such a heritage is seen as inferior…” and adopt another’s attitude and ways as superior (David, 2013).  Media such as television show American movies and dictate fashion.  I even consider English my first language rather than Tagalog because I use it more frequently. Due to colonialism, native Filipinos do not think of themselves as indigenous because they have begun setting themselves apart from each other due to the tended notion that those who keep to old traditions and are unconquered are coded as indigenous and otherwise infidels.  (Acabado, 2021). 7 In “Brown Skin, White Minds,” David (2013) contemplates how Filipinos come to believe “…that light skin is better; that the English language was better and is the language of the successful and educated; that discriminating against other Filipinos who were too Filipino is just a part of life (Preface, para. 1).” “Colourism” defined by Sabah Choudrey (2022) is “…favouritism of lighter skin over darker skin…[is]…unconscious conditioning because we are all socialized under the system of white supremacy, historically and globally (p.102).” Among other Asians, I have experienced the shame of being Filipino by overhearing that Filipinos are different from them as “jungle-Asians” and are seen as servants outside of the Philippines [ALDIJUEDEtv]. (2017).  King (2018) considers that individuals are not “exempt… from generational trauma” as we are conditioned by parents.  Both sociological and psychological, internalized oppression is “unconscious” programming and a “cumulative” effect of trying to fit in a dominant culture by people of color “to fear whites and to fear each other… aspire to whiteness…maintain racial subordination… [and]…subordinate other POC (King, 2018). 8 Figure 2 Intersectional Venn Diagram    9 “Hiya “Hiya” or shame among other “typical Filipino values” such as feeling of indebtedness out of gratitude (“Utang na loob”) and camaraderie (“pakikisama”) are characteristic of a collectivistic culture (David, 2013).  The three values are interrelated together and defined through the core of Filipino personality called “kapwa” or fellowship (David, 2013).   “Kapwa” defined by Virgilio Enriquez, the father of modern Filipino psychology, means “shared identity,” “equality,” and an “an obligation” of interacting “with others” (Concepcion, 2016) such as humankind.  “Kapwa” Concepcion (2016) states was “not just a virtue, but a law, a set of unspoken rules which dictated the hierarchy of a barangay (village/neighborhood), maintained social order, and ensured all families’ needs were met and provided for.”  Because of “kapwa,” Filipinos were able to gain their independence through a national revolution against their Western colonizers (2016).  However, “utang na loob” was abused by their colonizers into being taught that Filipinos were like children, and they owed a “debt of gratitude” towards those who they presumed superior to them such as the parental figures colonizers invoked who imparted to them religion and a foreign language as exchange for resources like land (Concepcion, 2016).  The problem raised by Concepcion (2016) is that the ideology predating colonizers were intended for peace within society, trade among neighboring Chinese, Indian, Malay, and local dominions.  “Utang na loob” kept Filipinos docile because they believed that even though their oppressors took from them, they benefitted from being taught to be “civilized.” “Walang utang na loob,” the opposite, meant a lack of gratitude and is regarded in Filipino society as a taboo (https://anchor.fm/salabasngclassroom/episodes/A-Portion-of-A-Taboo-A-Discussion-about-Insecurity-and-Loss-eub5om). “Utang na loob” (gratitude) and “hiya’(shame) created an 10 appearance of being obsequious in Western eyes.  Insecurity is passed down intergenerationally like a virus, through adopting the discipline taught by the colonizers as a parental virtue. Figure 3 Diagram of the Filipino 3 Core Values of “Kapwa” According to Virgilio Enriquez  Each of the three core values of “kapwa” negated by the word “walang” (meaning without) further gives clues to what the parameters of shame are to Filipinos. “Walang kapwa” would mean outcast.  “Walang pakikisama” means no sympathy.  An expression in Tagalog is “walang hiya” which means “without shame.”  “Walang hiya” is often spoken as a reprimand to negative behavior implying the lack of manners and inability to be corrected due to having been raised incorrectly with ignorance to pervading social consequences.  It connotes that the idea that shame is an ideal instrument for the conscience and acts as a safeguard to those who have shame 11 whereas those who don’t are expected to run into folly.  While shame in the West is intrinsic to a person who is compromised morally and is automatic; guilt pertains to someone having committed willful wrongdoings (Seok, 2015).  In comparison, both shame and guilt may translate with familiar cultural symptoms but cannot be presumed to be the same because they have different contexts and causes.  Alternatively, shame may be seen as “immature” due to the inability to make a choice, and guilt is mature due to the ability to make amends after (Seok, 2015). The value of a self-critical and self-reflective awareness of shame, for Confucian philosophy, is at the center of the moral mind. For Confucius, shame is the virtue of respectable officials (Analects 13.20), and for Mencius, shame is the one of the major foundations (xiu 羞 in xiu wu zhi xin 羞 恶之心) of the moral mind (Mencius 2A6, 6A6). In general, the sense and disposition of shame is one of the important moral abilities of an ideal human person in early Confucian philosophy. Even though shame is felt most strongly when one’s behavior is watched by others, especially by that one respect and admires (Mencius 2B9, 7A20)17, it is not the fear of rejection or an obsession with one’s self-image, but a self-reflective emotion toward ideal moral excellence that causes shame. That is, Confucian shame is not an underdeveloped form of moral stress or an affective withdrawal but is positive energy toward self-improvement and motivation for continuous self-cultivation.  (Seok, 2015) Seok (2015) also explains that Taoists accordingly attribute shame as natural; dually experiencing it as external chi (socially) and internal chi: a sense of “appropriateness” and with balanced purpose. 12 Lasquety-Reyes (2016) preferably leans towards 2 differences of “hiya:'' virtue and emotion.  By re-categorizing “hiya” through an ameliorated lens of Aquinian theology, he can reconcile the concept of shame from “original sin” affirming the colonized identity of the Filipino by embracing Catholic teachings to indigenous vestiges of “hiya.”  Lasquety-Reyes re-identifies ``hiya” particularly to Aquinas’ distinction of verecundia (fear of disgrace) as an “unpleasant emotion accompanying an act” which may serve as a “reproach” or cause the person to act out in secret even though they still experience verecundia.  He mentions that the second kind of “hiya” pertains to the virtue of temperance which makes the person aware of their “alienation” and “inferiority” and sublimates it toward a higher purpose.  Through this post-colonial lens, Filipinos can accept their core identity that was present before Christianization and make sense of it while retaining and adopting religious catechism.  Lasquety-Reyes mentions that amor propio or self-love and esteem manifests in Filipinos through the acute feelings of discourtesy or affronts toward dignity of a person tied to kapwa (2016) denoting that the social factor of kapwa is also present.  However, this inclination towards a sensitivity to insult or criticism is misappropriated as a pathological symptom regardless of context.   “Pakikisama '' (being able to get along with others) gets convoluted with modern peer-pressure.  What was virtue in other cultures is maladjusted to weakness or a failing of immaturity or not being individualized.  What has been adaptable and specific in culture is deemed by western opinion as primitive, infantile, and unsophisticated.  German psychoanalyst, Karen Horney wrote, “The view that women are infantile and emotional creatures, and as such incapable of responsibility and independence is the work of the masculine tendency to lower women’s self-respect.”  Whether in a constructivist way, patriarchal white supremacy has always championed its own qualities and puts its own authorship on what it deems as its subjects; or in a post-constructivist 13 way, white supremacy disregards the context of culture and focuses on symptoms and claims it as scientific. The objective of this research is to approach the different points of view in a postmodern manner theorizing that “reality theories and knowledge are never value-free” (Murie, et al., 2007) and presupposes the importance of context vs. plain empirical knowledge. Shame Wong (2017) elaborates on the “adaptive value of shame” when he writes that therapists can benefit from looking at shame holistically and exploring their own “blind spots of past shame.” From a multicultural perspective, Wong reiterates that shame enhances “harmony” especially in a duty-bound Confucian influenced culture such as the Philippines whose ancestors were theorized to have migrated from Taiwan pre-historically and have culturally intermingled with China for centuries.  In the East, shame is more identified with honor and moral obligation.  This is where Wong (2017) posits that emotions are dualistic in that they can be healthy and unhealthy as they overlap as necessary components to being a “functioning” human being “socially,” “culturally,” and “personally.”  Shame can lead to developing a responsible person and/ or create an imbalance dynamically in relationships and lead to toxicity (Wong, 2017) where facing the shadow of shame and mending are required. The emphasis of learning the cultural differences of shame “increases emotional intelligence” and fosters “humility,” “honesty,” “courage,” and transformation (Wong, et al) (2021).  As a consequence, an apologetic behavior and sensitivity to others strives unnaturally to maintain peace due to fear of reprimand. By reading the context of the times we live in, shame can appear and develop differently.  Authoritarian governments may use shame to control citizens (Scibona, 2019).  Public humiliation occurs in online bullying and can cause psychological damage (Scheff & Schorr, 14 2017). New media can exacerbate the “negative evaluation” of “moral self” and “social self” through group identification (Salice & Sanchez, 2016).  The paradox lies in the hypocrisy of traditional institutions like schools that project the ideology of meritocracy at work; we feel no choice but to strive in the unequal and ruthless competitive culture based on rank and status or simply fail and give up.  Social rank theory, based on Paul Gilbert’s work (2000) relates that such perceptions dealing with shame, social anxiety, and depression are “defensive strategies” that are fed by status and rank (Wong et al, 2021).  With the reality of inequality, injustice, and poverty pressing in on us, holding on to an escape such as meritocracy may seem to be the chance we are left to take. As in the case with Greco-Roman aretaic ethics, virtue is only viewed as a cultivation of “excellence” in character while humility, poverty, and shame are not regarded as lacking those qualities (Seok, 2015).  Even today, modern Western perspectives view guilt as the opposite of being innocent and resulting from a transgression.  Seok (2015) analyzes that the German, French, and Spanish word for shame all have semantically “negative-reactive” distinctions. Symptoms of guilt and shame are seen as the same, and a person suffering from shame may be regarded and treated as suspicious or inferior (Seok, 2015).  For instance, the physical expression of shame may be to lower one’s head and not look into the other’s gaze.  In the East, this traditionally indicates modesty, deference to an elder or higher rank, and to show passiveness or non-aggression.  Similarly, the modern face mask for Covid is seen in the east as respect for the community’s well-being.  Whereas a common understanding for people in the West is that the bowed head and refusal to look at another’s gaze signifies suspiciousness belied by guilty body expression.  A Covid face mask disrupts the notion of western individual freedom and would feel alienating.  Jena Barchas-Lichtenstein (2016) writes, “Each group is also uncomfortable with the 15 other’s communication strategies. An individualist may find the way collectivists solve problems to be frustratingly indirect or even passive aggressive. Meanwhile, collectivists often find the other approach uncomfortable and even rude.” (https://cultureready.org/blog/individualism-and-collectivism) Deeply ingrained in many aspects of society are systems of inequality that work toward white supremacy.  As a transgender of color, they may experience work discrimination, daily stress, and poverty while attending school.  A professor may belittle a student needing to get things done right away as perfectionism not knowing that the student is balancing other hardships and really wants resolution and relief from multi-tasking.  In response, the transgender person of color suffers the self-doubt with assessing themselves against what a person of authority just said.  The professor may not recognize that the transgender person of color is pressured to guarantee that the opportunity is not wasted and allowing such clarity and relief knowing that consequences and regret were easily diverted from the start by doing their best. My grandfather from my mother’s side cautioned me a few times; “Make sure you do things right the first time, because if you don’t it will be harder for you to pay later on.” Yet when a white male who makes sure things get done as efficiently as possible would be considered a responsible leader or enterprising in their work, impoverished Filipinos are seen as overextending and uppity in comparison.  Such an unprivileged minority may see it as unfair when co-workers get by doing less work and risk the whole team with consequences, yet having other people praised as easy-going or being unfairly looked at as a micromanager when they have their intertwined futures in consideration.  Using an opportunity as it arises was an adaptation to compensate for the comforts and utility of those with privilege. 16 As a forty-eight-year-old, I feel that I have learned in my life that there are chances things may go bad.  If I don’t consider that things go bad, I will become disappointed when I expect things to run perfectly and I don’t double-check the status of things.  By letting go of those concerns, I have regretted the opportunities to correct or make sure things go well even though other people were working on it due to their own carelessness.  I feel I cannot adopt sweet stress-free carelessness as an adult. White Supremacy On October 29, 2021, the APA (American Psychology Association) sent out an internet letter: “Apology to People of Color for APA’s Role in Promoting, Perpetuating, and Failing to Challenge Racism, Racial Discrimination, and Human Hierarchy in U.S. (Resolution adopted by the APA Council of Representatives) …” In this letter, the APA acknowledged failing in its role guiding the discipline of Psychology in which they were complicit in the bias and hurt against indigenous peoples and communities of color.  They point out historical evidence: the promotion of sterilization, segregation, eugenics, anti-marriage laws, and conforming to White racial hierarchy (American Psychology Association, 2021).  Their publication against other perceived races and against other non-European nations have caused damage in the progress of science and society along with other health workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists who are minorities suffering the consequence.  This recent acknowledgement importantly displays that established institutions of authority previously gaslit different people to be inherently dysfunctional and unhealthy in a culture of patriarchal white supremacy.   17 Stigma (Transgender) and Trauma  A notable definition of trauma is the exposure to problems or disturbing incident(s) that disrupts an individual’s wellbeing mentally, emotionally, physically, socially, and even spiritually because it is life threatening (Trauma-Informed Care, n.d.). Hypervigilance and anxiety being one symptom of PTSD or Post-traumatic disorder (WebMD, 2021). Bullying and neglect of transgenders is pervasive in society because white supremacy is believed to be functional and normal while anything contrary is foreign, considered disordered, and evil. Being transgender is sometimes confused with being synonymous as gender dysphoria because people may not have understood that what was problematic being labeled as gender identity disorder was unfounded because gender is a construct (World Health Organization, n.d.).  What the DSM mistakenly focused on identity has been changed instead to the anguish of transgenders by the incongruence of their mind to the body in the DSM-V (Huffpost, 2013).  When the pressure to belong to society (pakikisama) and self-loathing are indoctrinated by judgmental and dogmatic beliefs that being transgender is sinful, dirty, wrong, or an illness; the incongruence felt in dysphoria is magnified.  It becomes the victim’s fault when the perpetrator fails to see the negative impact of their actions and doesn’t want to correct it.  The victim is regarded as “being too sensitive” and thought to be responsible for their own hurt even if they were insulted.  Microaggressions, behaviors that are discriminating but often overlooked as unintentional such as a disapproving look or misgendering would be triggering to a person with trauma.  For the oppressor it may be “just a joke” or it was funny to them so it should be excusable if there is nothing in the rules that say anything about it.  The oppressor may not equate it as harassment at least willingly.  Because microaggressions in the form of a parody or joke that are broadcasted on TV would only subtly further legitimize such sadism, the victim 18 would feel shame and gaslighted because they see themselves outside the acceptance of society and as objects of ridicule. Neuroscientist Dan Siegel in Mindsight: The New Science of Personal Transformation, (cited by King, 2018) describes that the autonomic nervous system, beginning in the embryo is “hardwired with cellular memory --- fibers of our being were passed down from our ancestors… to some degree, preconditioned.”  Trauma, not only somatic, resides genetically, biologically verifying Jung’s concept of the collective unconscious passed on intimately by our ancestors in the most essential way possible. Decolonization Decolonization does not necessarily mean rejecting every modern, Western, American, and Spanish influence since there are many Filipinos with mixed ancestry and we consider many of the positive influences as vital parts of ourselves David, 2013, p.156).  David calls for equal, accurate and realistic understanding” of all things Filipino and American for a healthy concept of self (p.156).  He mentions the utilization of “client’s strengths and support systems” along with other possible therapeutic modalities such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for “self-defeating behaviors” and “internalized oppression” (p.163).  Furthermore, he explains that the “distorted core belief” can be upended through framing Filipino culture and ethnicity as “desirable” and lists: speaking Filipino, attending Filipino cultural events such as dances, and reading literature to “facilitate the identification of positive Filipino and Filipino American characteristics (p.167).  Other goals are to interact with other Filipinos “to reduce the client’s sense of isolation and improve the client’s appreciation… (p.168).   19 Babaylan In describing the indigenous Tao (Tagalog word for People), David (2013, pg. 10) points out the egalitarian nature of their society where women held equal power as men, property, divorce, and were regarded as healers, leaders, and warriors; he mentions the babaylan. They were regarded as shamans, wherein the feminine power resided in the spiritual world and that today’s bakla were once respected and valued along with women inheriting their affinity to the spirit world (Labrador, 2020).   My ancestors were performers in life. The earliest shamanic rituals involved women and men exchanging genders. Old, old rituals. Top-notch performances. Life and death stuff. We’re talking cross-cultural here. We’re talking rising way way way above being a man or a woman. That’s how my ancestors would fly. That’s how my ancestors would talk with the goddesses and the gods. Old rituals. (Bornstein 1994, p.143 as cited in Choudrey, 2022, pp. 16-17). Indigenous babaylan believed in animism which is the ritual worship and of spirits and deities in nature and reverence of ancestors all called anito (Hislop, 1971). Art & Ritual Art did not always exist as the western concept we commonly understand now as something commodifying and material.  According to Dissanayake (2017), art existed without a label in traditional, prehistoric, and pre-colonial societies often as a practice such as decorating, tattooing, carving, singing, playing instruments, chanting, presentation, and “enhancing their surroundings.”  She adds that individually, art is linked early in the attachment relationship between infant and mother through bonding and play to secrete opioid-like substances such as oxytocin which provide an evolutionary advantage (Dissanayake, 2017). It is hypothesized that 20 this “unnamed behavior” in societies or art begins with the “the making of something special” or “artifying” (elaborating) seen in everyday life and objects (Dissanayake, 2017).  Many animals are shown to also exhibit these basic tendencies of play and exhibition in “ritualized behaviors” (Dissanayake, 2017).  For premodern societies, ceremonial rituals tie in identity from culture originating from mother-infant interaction (Dissanayake, 2017).  Figure 4 Dissanayake’s Hypothesis on the Beginnings of Art  21 Figure 5 “Life like Art” vs “Art like Art”  Postmodernism In art, principles of postmodernism are derived from social interaction and parts of society that generate them (MacGregor, 1992).  Alan Kaprow (1983) designates “life like art” from “art like art” as art purposefully used in life, while the latter is art for art’s sake.  As part of a critical paradigm, “a framework through which knowledge is filtered” (Leavy, 2017) alternative to the existing pressures of the status quo, the researcher employs postmodernism to deconstruct assumptions regarding pre-colonial Filipino attitudes and rituals in being transgender. Narrative Therapy  Narrative therapy “considers the individual…” in understanding that “the problems which co-exist with their stories are reflections of cultural practices (Gladding 2013).”  According to one of its postulates, individuals use symbolic language or metaphors to express themselves which essentially become stories (Baştemur et al.,2021).  In this regard, the metaphors are socially constructed as they relate and interact with other people: distinguishing the individual’s 22 identity in a way that the individual becomes an expert in their own life and they externalize the problem (Baştemur et al.,2021).   Steve Madigan describes three stages of narrative therapy.  The first is deconstructing problematic dominant stories and naming the problem.  The second stage is re-authoring problematic dominant stories.  And the third stage is remembering conversations (https://counseling.education/counseling/theories/narrative.html).   Hamrick cites: Art therapists have called for the decolonization of art therapy (Gipson, 2015; Talwar, 2010, 2015), a field populated largely by white, heterosexual, cisgender women, and shaped by a medical discourse that is both Eurocentric and patriarchal (Talwar, Iyer, & Doby-Copeland, 2004).  By applying the first stage of narrative therapy in deconstructing prevalent Eurocentric and patriarchal assumptions towards the research of transgender and Filipino shame within the literature review, a critical paradigm and postmodern structure is provided allowing therapy and re-authorship of identity to follow.  The second stage of narrative therapy is re-authoring which takes place within heuristic methods in exploring the researcher’s artwork during their schooling in Art Therapy: finding, re-assessing, and building strength with additional found affirmations --- skills that adapt to the situation from being self-critical and shaming oneself.  The third stage is remembering conversations which applies to gathering articles of pre-colonial Filipino culture such as the baybayin script and native Filipino recipes to reconnect with one’s own racial memory through the conversations in art (since much of other historical narratives have been erased by colonialism) and responding to the primal ties connecting through ancestry in ritual or “unnamed art” in traditional cultures. 23 Heuristic Research Djuraskovic & Arthur (2010) summarizes heuristic research as a non-empirical method developed by Moustakas in Loneliness, 1961 as a way of self-understanding and exploring meaning through immersion in the phenomenon. Moustakas’ concepts will be further developed within the structure of Narrative Therapy.  In the early stage of Narrative therapy, the researcher will apply (1) the focus of inquiry, (2) self-dialogue to accompany the research in the literature review, (3) tacit knowing and (4) intuition in the re-authoring stage dealing with past artwork; (5) indwelling and (6) focusing in using affirmations; and internal frame of reference through art to remember conversations. Shadow Work We associate the shadow with unpermitted qualities that don't fit our socially developed image of ourselves (Zweig & Abrams, 1991). According to Zweig and Abrams (1991), the same social forces that shape the ego also shape the shadow, such as parents, clergy, and authority. As a result, shadows vary across cultures according to what they permit, such as sex and ambition, for instance. \"The shadow is the result of infantile parts, emotional attachments, neurotic symptoms, and undeveloped abilities and gifts,\" Frey-Rohne says (Zweig & Abrams, 1991). As Marie Von Franz points out, we project our desires, disgusts, and anger onto others in order to hide them from ourselves (Zweig & Abrams, 1991). Our shadows are revealed through such triggers. It may be necessary to investigate the shadow in order to achieve self-acceptance.   24 Chapter III: Methodology In this qualitative study, Moustakas' heuristic analysis was integrated into the basic structure of Narrative Art Therapy. Through narrative therapy, a therapeutic structure was provided to facilitate immersion with the topic phenomenon of shame: re-contextualized the story, distinguished social concept of offensive shame from the self, linking lost identity with the present experience through art and ritual inspired by the babaylan in Filipino colonial pre-history. Table 1Additionally, the researcher included Graham Wallas' (1976) stages of the creative process and Leny Strobel's (2001) steps for decolonization in the table for comparison and reference.

V: Discussion Remembering Conversations Internal Frame of Reference Creative Synthesis    Population As a population, the researcher studied themselves. Thus, their identities intersect as \"trans-femme,\" \"chinay\" (Filipino with recognizable Chinese ancestry living in the United States), and \"Generation X\" (born between 1965 and 1980). Location At the time of the research, the controversies that surrounded the Trump regime, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the US concern over the Ukrainian and Russian Wars affected the researcher as a subject. Distractions, work stress were persistent, and yet a background source for the graduate student understanding their shame.  The weeks that led up to the Art Therapy program's uncertain future at Notre Dame de Namur University and transfer to Dominican University of California caused doubt and uncertainty for the graduate student. Their direct family members (including themselves) were once or twice infected with covid but have recovered. The researcher took on the added responsibility of caring for their mother who’s in Texas, while at the same time finishing another class in art therapy. Also, beginning work at a crisis residential center also affected the researcher’s heuristic exploration working through shame in the guise of perfectionism. 26 Following the Trump regime, the Covid-19 pandemic, the Russian and Ukrainian war, and the mother of the student researcher who lives out of state in Texas, the student researcher balanced work life and school through hybrid distance learning via Zoom. They worked on their I-Pad and laptop on the bed of their rental room in California, near a shelf of books, art supplies, food, and clothing. The researcher also worked on a desk in their mother's apartment using their I-Pad, books, laptop, watercolors, and other items from California as well as items in their mother's home. At times, the researcher also utilized Dominican University’s Archbishop Alemany Library and the San Pablo public library. For the ritual, the researcher designated Point Richmond’s Keller beach as the location that ended the art experiential. Research Design Heuristic and arts-based research were used to qualitatively articulate the researcher's personal experience of processing shame. The research was based on the concept of narrative art therapy as well as Strobel's decolonization steps. Strobel's identification and naming of oppression parallels the problem of shame introduced in Chapter One. As part of Chapter Two: Literature Review, they deconstructed various perspectives of shame to provide analysis that was focused on POC’s (people of color) perspectives which followed Strobel's second stage of decolonization of reflection. The structure of Chapter Three parallels narrative therapy as the person sought an experiential that built a storyline to convey meaning and Strobel's call to action. Results presented in Chapter Four applied past artwork limited to items created within the researcher's art therapy program to externalize the process. Artwork was adapted to tell the story of shame, to acknowledge the storyteller (researcher), and written down as brief reflections or captions proposed for data. In Procedures, we described and further explored gathering affirmations online that resonate with the heuristic researcher.   27 Confidentiality As a participant in the study, the researcher understood the importance of confidentiality. In this study, the only participant was the researcher. Resulting data in the researcher's files were archived. Procedures Throughout the process, the researcher collected affirmations from quotes posted as online memes on Facebook or the internet that resonated intuitively and positively to them. They used these affirmations to create a scrapbook. Building the scrapbook of affirmations helped contain the affirmations used by the participant to process shame in a way that felt more compassionate towards themselves. They regarded the selected quotes as personally relating to their own issues.  In every session an affirmation was read before starting to analyze a picture of the researcher’s old artwork from one of their classes. The affirmation provided an idea as a starting point worked on and validation.  To support the immersion process and self-care, each session was interspersed with rest as a reflection of Moustakas's (1990) concept of immersion and incubation.   A culmination of 12 sessions included artworks, affirmations, and native food sources signifying the understanding of ritual in indigenous Filipino’s knowledge of the lunar year shared between Asian Hindu and Buddhist astronomy. Each session ended with the contemplation of pre-colonial food from the provided picture. The recognition of food as pre-colonial connection added a visceral and sensorial element that incited deeper memory to the notion of identity. A spreadsheet recorded the elements of art and three words of affect are compared in Chapter IV. Once completed, as part of ritualizing the experience, the participant 28 dedicated an offering bowl inspired by Filipino anito (ancestral spirts) which finalized the \"retelling of the story.\"  A video documentation of the ritual was created. Measures Sessions took place everyday for 4 days. Time measurements were based on the rising and setting of the sun, so the participant used Tagalog words equivalent to morning, noon, afternoon, and night: \"umaga,\" \"tanghali,\" \"hapon,\" and \"gabi.\"  Materials used, title of the art piece, and appropriate process notes on separate forms were recorded for later reference.  Materials: ● Small Journal for scrapbook ● Journal or (I-Pad/Laptop) to put down findings ● Printer and paper ● Scissors ● Found or bought bowl (if necessary) any material chosen by participant ● Assorted found, chosen, or collected rocks from artist’s collection ● Assorted found, chosen, or collected beads from artist’s collection ● Assorted found objects, plants, ceramic pieces, figures from artist’s personal items ● Small boxes or containers ● Adhesive (waterproof) ● 12 Selected art therapy artworks from pre-existing collection (photograph or actual object) ● Colored paint, and markers ● Copperplate ● Brushes 29 ● Acrylic paint ● Ink ● Wooden plaques Data Collection Methods In a spreadsheet, data in the form of words and art will be collected, analyzed, and processed, and a ritual art-piece will synthesize the heuristic experience. In the results selection of the research paper, the researcher will further document and process the results. The research paper will present the entire collected work and its findings in order. A video documenting the ritual process. Data Analysis The structure of Narrative Therapy served as a containment for processing the shame of the researcher participant. As data, art was analyzed by the participant and accompanied by affirmations cut from the internet.  In the analysis, the shadow of shame was given voice in a safe manner.  Heuristic educated guesses, associations, descriptions of affects, and systemizing the artistic elements, the researcher-participant intended to psychologically process a way that was beneficial and strengths-orientated.  Prior research into former models of decolonization helped the participant identify as a transgender Filipino. Researching on shame continued as the researcher processed their identity now strengthened by the Filipino babaylan archetype. Risks and Benefits Being trans-femme and Pinay, the researcher dealt with intersectional issues. One of those issues was shame. To restructure and externalize a researcher's problems, their focus on shame was balanced with affirmations and art. This way, the researcher participant felt validated with research that taught them about cultural acceptance by accepting themselves.  It was also 30 necessary to acknowledge culture and different points of view to the morality imposed by white supremacy Conclusion In this study, narrative therapy was assigned as the framework for heuristic exploration of shame.  Past artworks were re-evaluated and deconstructed in the light of research, the researcher formed new understanding of their own works.  They chose and read affirmations while processing artworks of shame in order to reduce  the negative perspective.   31 Chapter IV: Results Based on a heuristic study conducted in an art-based research process, relatable affirmations were randomly matched with a piece of artwork already created during the researcher’s graduate studies. Information was gathered from personally interpreting the iconography and listing the elements that were perceived on a spreadsheet. The developing conversation on shame was gathered in a lived-in milieu of the researcher’s mind. Frequency of Engagement Throughout the day, the affirmations were recited and their artwork viewed based on the traditional overview of times in Tagalog: umaga for morning, tanghali for noon, hapon for afternoon, and gabi for night. Accordingly, pictures of meals were thought appropriate based on observations of the times of day. Each day, four sessions were used to engage with the materials. Twelve sessions in total were used by the researcher to engage with the materials. In the course of writing this paper, the researcher continued to contemplate the meaning of shame. Artistic Elements According to the incidental selection of artwork representing the researcher’s inquiry into personal shame (seen in Figure 6), the number of three-dimensional artwork emerges as the most chosen type of artwork. The researcher appears to have inadvertently used eight artworks utilizing form (three-dimensional) in dealing with shame. Figure 6 lays out the emphasis on two dimensional work (or shape) as secondary in the participant’s choosing of type of artwork for shame. It is noteworthy to add that the participant uses different types of art mediums in their work. To differentiate the mediums, the participant labels the use of pens, ink, and types of pencils as drawing medium whereas the application of non-drawing materials will be labeled as mixed media.  32 Table 2 Participant’s preference (most used) for 3D or 2D artwork.  3-D 2-D 3-D & 2-D Hybrid Medium Art Book Yes No Yes Mixed media Mandala No Yes No Drawing medium Teacup Yes No No Mixed media Medusa Yes No No Readymade Shield Yes No Yes Drawing medium Mask Yes No No Mixed media Amulet Yes No No Mixed media Older Me No Yes No Drawing medium Shadow Box Yes No No Mixed media Family Elements No Yes No Drawing medium Abstract doodle No Yes No Drawing medium Joy Box Yes No No Mixed Media Total yes 8 4 1    33 Table 3 The participant is attracted to color.

In order to graph this, she delineated the graph in Figure 7 to show the different total of monochromatic works to works with six colors (including shades, tints, and saturation as their own color) or less. Artworks with seven colors and more are considered colorful for the participant.  Figure 7 graph indicates that there is only one artwork considered monochromatic. That artwork is called “Older Me.” Most of the artwork considered by the participant is six colors or less. Whereas there are only a sum of three artworks with more than six colors that she felt were very colorful. 34 Table 4 Participant’s choice of physical representation: humanoid or reference to humanoid or object.

The participant has a total of two figurative artworks that use the human body as a metaphor. Three of her artistic body of work partially includes a human face within the metaphor. Seen in Figure 8, the participant has used objects as metaphors instead of referring to the human body. Objects often serve as less painful placeholders when dealing with shame. 35 Table 5 Participant’s single attributed taste when judging a native dish  Sweet Sour Bitter Salty Umami Laing Mostly     Tahong      Kilawin  Mostly    Adobong Pusit     Mostly Sinigang  Mostly    Kare-Kare     Mostly Dinuguan     Mostly Biko Mostly     Daing    Mostly  Papaitan   Mostly   Pinakbet   Mostly   Balut     Mostly  In Figure 9, the participant has selected twelve of what she thinks are the most native Filipino dishes she remembers. The participant selected these dishes based on what she thinks “Westerners” may find most exotic and different from mainstream cuisine available in the United States. Despite the complexity of the ingredients and flavor, the participant has selected a single primary taste in order to categorize the dishes. Laing and Biko are categorized as mostly Sweet. Laing is a vegetable dish served with meals. Biko is a banana wrapped dessert often served traditionally during merienda. What appears to be uniquely similar between them is the coconut ingredient mainly in the form of coconut milk. Surprisingly, only two dishes represent 36 sour since the participant expected most of the dishes to be flavored with fermented vinegar.  Figure 9 presents Kilawin and Sinigang as primarily sour. Similarities between Kilawin and Sinigang are the sour fruits that primarily flavor the dishes. Though Kilawin uses vinegar and Sinigang usually does not involve any vinegar. Uniquely categorized as bitter are papaitan and pinakbet. Papaitan is a meat dish cooked in the animal’s bile. Pinakbet is a varied and green vegetable dish notable for the salted fresh vegetable taste. However, the participant felt that pinakbet’s defining characteristic are the vegetables that would fall under bitter acquired taste. Daing is any dried fish usually fried and served with garlic rice and vinegar. The dried fish is the only selected one for salty. Umami has the most dishes. Adobong pusit, Kare-kare, Dinuguan, and Balut fairly represents four different types of umami dishes in the participant’s imagination. Adobong pusit is specially cooked squid in its ink. Kare-kare is oxtail and vegetables in a peanut curry. Dinuguan is a spicy meat dish cooked in the meat’s blood. When remembering these dishes, the participant ruminated on their shame when other people not from her culture dismissed her food and sneered at the ingredients. As a response, the participant thought about the ingenious ways her ancestors made ecologically healthy and delicious ways of preserving food to survive and thrive.   37 Figure 6 Frequency and Durations of the Ending Ritual One can view the video documentation of the ending ritual on YouTube Figure 7 Clip from the ending ritual  38 Figure 8 Clip from video of ending ritual showing the location Conclusion In Chapter IV, the researcher gathered and organized the data which were indiscriminately collected from reviewing her past art, learning the knowledge gained about her shame, visually accepting food from her native culture, and processing her affirmations. The results are broken down into tables of artistic elements: shape vs form, color, and motifs. Additional food sensorium supplemented the experience drawing the researcher closer to old memories of her homeland through the memory of taste with the visual senses.   39 Chapter V Discussion As a transgender Filipino woman immigrant to the United States, I wanted to explore how I could change the narrative and overcome the colonial mentality inherited from previous generations.Through a heuristic immersion in past art from art therapy classes, I processed the shame inhibiting my individualization. As a starting point, I compared the similarities between the forms, colors, then iconography. Using the art work’s image as a reference, metaphors of shame emerged throughout this exploration. Each artwork paired with a random affirmation is re-contextualized based on my life experience.  Also included is a discussion of possible future applications. Summary of Themes of Shame Figure 9 8/9 Noon: Front and Back of a Mask. A 3 dimensional mixed media art. The front face (on the left) shows an idealized and reflective surface composed of glitter, silver, and glass eyes. The back of the mask (on the right) expresses wild vines and bleedin  Figure 6 shows that I tended to use 3D forms and mixed media the most, and 2D forms and drawing mediums as secondary. The majority of my works averaged at least six colors. A total of five out of twelve artworks depicted the human form. Faces were incorporated into the artwork as part of the series. There is a lot of information to be learned from the face, so much so 40 that the face appears in two separate pieces of art as a mask and a mirror. There is a picture of a mask on 8/9 noon that shows both the exterior and interior. Reflective materials, such as glitter and silver paint, are used on the exterior of the mask, suggesting a mirror. Similarly, the 8/10 morning display features a ceramic face or mask that opens into a compact with two mirrors inside. Each face is idealized and resembles a mask. As the mask of the dark box is depicted (8/10 morning), it represents both a mask and its shadow. Rather than being in the box, the shadow is in the box itself. In the same way as a box, the shadow protects its contents. In essence, the mask represents how I am influenced by society and become a reflection of it. There  Figure 10 8/10 Morning. Dark box (Shadow) with a face. Face is an idealized mask that opens as a 2 mirrors.  are parts of me that feel beholden to other people's opinions about me, and I think I can't express myself freely in the gender society specifies. Affirmation 8/10 morning is about boundaries and knowing what is under my control. The affirmation relates to the mask and mirror theme because I realize by combining the affirmation with the artwork, I am able to make connections to how I came to be who I am.  In my upbringing, I was raised to obey my authoritative parents. Every time I disagreed with them or tried to support my argument, my pleas were denied and rejected. 41 Throughout my life, I have learned that I must please others in order to survive. As a result, I acquired the ability to extend feelers to anticipate situations and read negative cues in order to alleviate them. Being sensitive has both been a blessing and a curse for me. Fortunately, the affirmation for 8/9 noon prescribed detachment for me. By practicing boundaries and detachment consistently, I can reduce anxiety related to being emotionally over-sensitive to other people's feelings. Figure 11 Affirmation for 8/10 morning.  My artwork also incorporates shadows. As I discussed earlier, it appears in my mandala at 8/8 noon  and metaphorically in the image of the Medusa at 8/8 night. I described the dark box as a shadow that protects. Shadows in mandalas symbolically represent my darker nature; something I have been ashamed of rather than acknowledging and accepting as part of myself. It is that part of me that is the Medusa. It is fitting that Medusa, like my parents, is called the\"Death Mother\" for being judgmental over her own children (aromagnosis, 2019. 42 Figure 12 8/8 night (on the left) The Medusa (readymade appropriated for sandplay). 8/8 noon (on the right) Mandala (2-D, drawing)  My view of snakes has been a mixture of horror, disgust, and fascination. The shadow can only be described as the most repulsive and ugly part of myself that is metaphorically matched by the snake aspect of the Medusa. In times of stress and difficulty, the Medusa emerges as a dark protector. She guards my insecurities like a mother protects her child. A siren whose lullaby is the fear of losing love and life . When she lashes out, she is difficult. A radical acceptance affirmation combined with a mandala, a symbol of integrating both my positive and negative sides, is intended for 8/8 noon. When one is a perfectionist, accepting a flawed and broken image of oneself is much harder than motivating oneself to please others. David Read Johnson (1994) writes that shame is noticed through “heightened interpersonal boundaries… a transfer of shame to others… and overcompensation” seen in perfectionism (p.175). Likewise, Medusa compulsively is drawn to her face but struggles to look at herself in the mirror.   43 Figure 13 My notes for my mixed media book art on 8/8 morning read as: “…Confusion between self-love and selfishness. I was taught to be selfless and sacrificing as a reflection of true love. Other people and parents critique of my behavior became the moral compass of my worth. The ‘geisha’ is appropriated as a symbol within the world as an artist and worker bound to debt…”  My perfectionistic tendencies cause me to criticize myself and others as a premonitory way for safety. Nevertheless, self-love with self-reflection is not self-criticism, as it does not demand and eat away at myself with accusations of \"not being enough.\" The charcoal self-portrait is a kind and quick rendering of myself in the future. With a smile on my face, I appear as a matronly old woman. Because of its simplicity, I initially didn't value this artwork. This simple drawing evokes a joyful acceptance in me. It was a drawing done years ago, but it presaged my acceptance of growing old as a woman, which I could never imagine as a man. Due to feeling more content in my body, I wear less makeup as I transition. I see myself as this older woman who has gained wisdom, understanding, and contentment. 44 I don't think contemplating the significance of my artwork came solely about in a quiet vacuum of art-gazing. It is more likely that the pressures of my everyday life had an influence on me throughout the planning, the exploration, and the writing of the paper. Apart from the hardships of COVID-19, threats of war, housing crisis, government instabilities, and recession, my performance as a counselor at a crisis residential facility also affected me. I was able to reflect on the stress I inflicted on myself because of striving for rigid perfectionism. Figure 14 Random Artwork 2D & 3D based of a Family Shield depicting entanglements 8/9 morning    45 The Significance of Food I felt that this heuristic process would not be complete without the addition of food. As a perfectionist, I wanted to gather each native dish and eat it as part of the ritual, however, I relinquished perfectionism and substituted imagination and recalled native dishes I have actually eaten before. In affirming these foods I rejected during my childhood, I regain the knowledge of being part of a community by reliving experiences only food can provide. In the appendix, I noted observations that elevated the ingenuity and innovation of my ancestors. Limitations: Internal & External Validity In addition, I would like to emphasize that the heuristic and arts-based research reflects the key premise that these are self-discoveries that may be further refined to have broader application one day. For the purpose of analyzing my shame qualitatively, I welcomed any inherent or passing bias that would enhance my understanding. My mistakes at my job had taught me a lot, and I was open to learning from them. As I deemed that disclosing too much was negligible in terms of benefits, I decided to generalize rather than go in-depth. Findings & Contributions to the Literature In my attempt to process shame, I was painfully reminded of my own striving for perfection. Both in art and in life, I was seeking a beatific vision that would satisfy my longings, unrequited loves, and hopes in a brief moment of validation. I attempted to transubstantiate the banal and imperfect into the ideal. Quantifying that concept would have been difficult. Nevertheless, my explorations have forced me to endure the anxiety and shame that come from being flawed. As a result of experiencing liminal feelings of incompletion, I sought both psychological and practical benefits from failure. Judith Halberstam's writings on failure are mentioned in The Queer Art of Failure. She reframes failure as a rebellion against fascism, 46 capitalism, and the status quo. As she reminds us, queer culture has benefited from accepting life and distancing itself from mainstream tyranny. As someone who feels shame after failing, the belief that we can learn from our failures gives me strength. When the conquistadors invaded the Philippines, the natural value of “hiya” was hijacked. Like an autoimmunity, it mistakenly attacked its own people as “shame.” Hiya regulated a collectivist, egalitarian culture in which the third gender was integrated into society's roles and women legitimately decided their own affairs and raise their families was subverted into patriarchy and westernized shame. My experience as a Filipino transgender woman led me to confront the shame colonialism left behind and thrust myself into the forbidden void before history. Embracing the spirit of my ancestors, the babaylan; the sacred people of the third sex who lay dormant in my genes, I touched the psychological shadow of the Filipino Indios and Mestizos. The suppressed shadow from intergenerational trauma are the…”cellular memory” or “fibers of our being ...passed down from ancestors...preconditioned” as Neuroscientist Dan Siegel states in Mindsight: the New Science of Personal Transformation (cited by King, 2018). Strobel (2022) mentions decolonization in order to heal the part of ourselves that has been systematically removed, the part of ourselves that accepts transgender people and women as pakikisama (a core value) or \"togetherness.\" Recommendations for Future Research After writing Chapter Three, I found an opportunity to work at a Crisis Center. Around this time, I have also followed the legal procedures in changing my gender and name in my driver’s license and social security card. Prior to that, I also underwent an orchiectomy in order to help with my hormone treatments and dysphoria. I wanted a fresh start and present myself at my new job congruent to my identity. As a result, Chapter Five faithfully reflects the 47 transformation that was tied to different events happening in my life. This heuristic exploration is indicative of the outside variables that at once make a live-in experience realistic and conceptually “imperfect.” However, it was the culmination of events that pushed me into deciding to accept the reality outside of my mind as an environment of uncontrollable factors to live and possibly learn from. Taken further, I can imagine the twelve art images or more to be abstracted into archetypal motifs that can be developed and paired with possibly more affirmations as a deck of cards. The pictures of food can also be used as a supplementing deck to ground the trans FilipinX to her/their identity while exploring important themes. I believe that this is how I imagine it would develop and become a useful art therapeutic tool. The ritual in the end would highly benefit future participants in providing closure and externally manifesting their desires into art. Abbe Miller's innovative art-based model derived from assemblage paintings demonstrates the possibility of heuristic processes using art images as cards. My thesis professor, Dr. Partridge, introduced me to Abbe Miller's work called soror mystica after I mentioned I wished I had begun researching tarot cards and art therapy sooner. In my conversation with my professor, I explained that this was my natural inclination. At that moment, Dr. Partridge introduced me to the possibility of future research pioneered by others, such as Abbe Miller. Examples of Abbe Miller’s therapeutic art-based work: soror mystica can be found in this link: https://www.abbemiller.com/elduendeprocesspainting. Conclusion In participating in my own heuristic research, I find that art is a useful tool to draw out topics that may seem to have no beginning to initiate oneself into exploring. Art served as understanding my own stories in a ritualized way in which the experience is more real than what 48 is actually happening. I believe that to understand the mind, we can understand it from the outside or we can understand it from within.   49 References Acabado, S. (2021, October 13).

Kilawin/Kinilaw  Raw marinated similar to ceviche or sushi  Filipinos also were able to use and eat fresh meat as a delicacy by cooking it in vinegar or citrus acid such as squeezed juice from calamansi.   The taste is sublime and fresh from the sea and from citrus. It is lightly seasoned with pepper and ginger, making it spicy, sweet and sour. Adobong pusit  Hispanicized name, but native technique. We use vinegar to ferment, preserve, and cook our foods. The sourness often becomes sweet with other foods. Different “provincial” ways to cook different meats, each one their own specialty.  Texture of calamari/squid is unlike anything other. Delicate other meat. 55  Umaga (morning) Tanghali (noon) Hapon (afternoon) Gabi (night) Picture     Affirmation Theme for Me Resistance, dissonance Feeling heard.

Filipino cuisine isn’t even celebrated as high fashion food. It is our own “soul-food.” Daing  Any Dried Fish type Known by Filipino expats that the smell of daing to someone who isn’t familiar to it may be repulsive as rotten fish or fishy. To natives, the smell is familiar, savory, and mouthwatering when fried or cooked with other food first thing for breakfast. It is often regarded by our own colonial mentality as poor people’s food or servants’ food. The drying and preserving of fish shows that my ancestors were ingenious and survivors.   Papaitan  Bitter (goat) stew. Actually, goat for me is a sweeter meat than domestic cow. It is offal composed of pre-washed and washed again entrails. This shows how Filipinos survived when meat was scarce. It shows what the enslavers did not know they missed. The delicious tenderness of the bittersweet soup and organ meats such as kidneys and hearts. I think now chefs understand the deliciousness of these sought after parts. I think symbolically it shows that the unwanted parts are valuable and strengthening such as the heart, kidneys, and even intestines. Pinakbet  Briny from fermented fish or shrimp paste extracting juices from the different vegetables (string beans, ampalaya or bitter gourd, squash, eggplant, okra, and crispy roasted/fried pig or boar “baboy damo.” Our moms and lolas (grandmothers) would tell us to “eat our vegetables.” Pinakbet is a dish we grew to love as adults. Balut  I learned about shame early as a child because I was brought up with westernized ideas that critiqued myself as primitive or unsophisticated because of how we were repulsed by our own people eating duck embryos. We fetishized the folk tales of the food being an aphrodisiac.  The egg itself is warm and comforting. It provides many nutrients and is very filling. There is meat and even natural soup inside. You learn to eat it by breaking the shell, slurping the broth, and putting salt on the flesh. 57  Umaga (morning) Tanghali (noon) Hapon (afternoon) Gabi (night) Artwork     Affirmation Theme for Me Validation, worth Letting go, peace Finding love Mindfulness, seeing truth Journal Notes: Art Family as a unique and varied bouquet of flowers.  Mask/Mirror: Barren & Reflecting what everyone projects on me VS. the messy growth of weeds and nature inside wanting to sprout outwards. Miracles and joy in the little things to survive. Found objects that become precious. Drawing the self in the future. Trying to be truthful and project what I desire also. Art Notes: Affect Entangled, competing to survive, growth Outside and Inside Feeling valuable. Being ok with who and what you are as you age. Element Colors are saturated on top of black background further individualizing each form of flower as unique and separate.  But the green stems are organized to connect them together in a random bunched way. The physical form is structured as a positive front of the mask and back of the mask. The front suggests 2  monochromatic clusters of glitter. The back shows randomized green trails suggesting vines and interspaced red blots suggesting flowers. Dynamic hues of purple intertwine around a dark cool crystal blue sphere and a frosted sea glass. A seashell is glued below, acting as a base and container.

Because one is content with oneself, one doesn’t need others approval. Because one accepts oneself, the whole world accepts him or her. Lao Tzu  Native Food  Sinigang  This steaming sour soup made from tamarind fruits such as guava and pineapple. The base of the soup is also made from the bones and meat of either pork, beef, or chicken, and fish with seafood (shrimp).  I love how the soup is loaded with vegetables, cabbages, daikon radishes, and etc.  The meat can be paired with rice to make a meal where the soup can be added to flavor rice. When it is made with the head of the fish it shows the guest that it is fresh and flavored well. I get that Western views see the head of the animal in food as unappealing.  Kare-kare  This is Filipino Curry is primarily golden from annato seeds though saffron can also be used. The stew is thickened from coconut and banana blossoms. With mostly beef oxen tails, tripe and tongue may also be used. This native dish shows our connection to the southeast as it looks similar to curry. We can’t forget that we are part of that world, and we are also influenced by the other countries that occupied the Philippines in our history. It is a full meal that includes cabbages and string beans. Dinuguan  Euphemistically called “chocolate meat” by our caregivers to a westernized generation for the dark color of the gravy. Probably showing our own colonial mentality to a beloved national dish.  It is made of pork blood and bits of pork from different leftover parts of the animal. It is cooked with ginger and peppery spices along with vinegar.  It is a invigorating and magical dish. Biko / Suman  The traditional desserts of the Philippines are inherently not to sweet. Though nowadays we’ve introduced a lot of unnecessary sugar to these fresh foods.  Biko is the Tagalog name and Suman is the Ilocanos word for the rice cakes wrapped in banana leaves. They are sprinkled with caramelized coconut. They also come in different colors as they can be made with green pandan and purple ube. They are also pretty to look at with their bright colors and/or banana wrapping. The packaging is also smart because it is ecologically friendlier than even plastic. 59  Umaga (morning) Tanghali (noon) Hapon (afternoon) Gabi (night) Picture     Affirmation Theme for Me Self-reflective.

As a transgender woman, she examines what it is like to be labeled as Filipino and deal with being transgender.

Using art to expose those feelings associated with shame, balance them with affirmations, and ground them in native identity are key aspects of this process. Consequently, meeting one\\u27s shadow becomes a necessity for self-acceptance. There is a discussion about the potential to readapt the exploratory process into a card game for art therapy",
