FrostUniversity of SurreyTransgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity.They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developingmental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model usedto understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparitiesfaced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model tothe transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minoritystress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzingeffects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia,and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), onmental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination andinternalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems,while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reducedthe strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health.Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies.Transgender is an inclusive term referring to people whose gender identityis not fully aligned with their sex assigned at birth (American Psychological As-sociation [APA], 2015).

As argued by someauthors (e.g., Hendricks & Testa, 2012), similar to the gay, bisexual, and lesbianpopulations, transgender people are exposed to chronic social stress, or minoritystress, due to their minority identity, which places them at risk for mental healthproblems. According to the theory (Meyer, 2003a, 2007; see Williams & Mann,2017, for overview), minority stress has a direct relationship with negative healthoutcomes, but protective factors—such as support, or community connectedness—can moderate the relation. As suggested by the Institute of Medicine (IOM, 2011),applying the minority stress model in research permits a deeper understanding ofthe mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Theminority stress model has only recently been empirically applied to transgenderexperiences (Bockting et al., 2013; Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam, & Bockting,2015). Limited work to date has been conducted in Italy, and, to our knowledge,no studies yet exist that have tested the minority stress model in Italian transgen-der people. We aimed to understand the stigma that Italian transgender peopleexperience, and analyze its effects on mental health.Minority Stress in Transgender PopulationsLeading researchers (e.g., Hendricks & Testa, 2012) and organizations (e.g.,APA, 2015) have stressed the need to deepen the understanding of the phenomenarelated to minority stress among transgender people. A focus on minority stress,indeed, avoids pathologizing or blaming transgender individuals for these healthdisparities, and instead assumes disparities originate in the stigmatizing social cli-mate to which transgender people are exposed. Regarding the most distal stressors,or prejudice events, evidence indicates that transgender people suffer from highlevels of violence and discrimination. For instance, Bradford et al. (2013) found ina sample of 350 transgender people recruited in Virginia that 41% suffered fromtransgender-related discrimination and that associated factors included gender(i.e., being Female to Male, or FtM), low socioeconomic status, ethnicity, lack ofhealth insurance, younger age at first transgender awareness, history of violence,substance use, and low levels of family support and community connectedness.There is evidence that psychological problems among transgender people stemfrom minority stress, both distal and proximal. For instance, Lombardi (2009),within a sample of 90 transgender people from California, found that experienc-ing transphobic events are associated with depression and anxiety. Bockting et al.(2013), in a sample of 1,093 U.S. transgender people, reported that social stigmais associated with increased depression, anxiety, and somatization. Consideringproximal stressors (e.g., internalized, perceived, or anticipated stigma) and trans-gender health, for instance, Testa et al. (2012) stated that, due to the expectationsMinority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 565of violence and discrimination, transgender people tend not to report violence tothe police.Hendricks and Testa (2012) recommend paying particular attention to sui-cidality, because rates of suicide attempts by transgender people appear alarm-ing. Clements-Nolle, Marx, and Katz (2006) reported that 32% of their sample(N = 515) had attempted suicide. And, Perez-Brumer, Hatzenbuehler, Oldenburg,and Bockting (2015) reported that high levels of internalized transphobia rep-resent a high risk factor related to suicide attempts. Internalized transphobia, aproximal stressor, consists of “profound shame, guilt, and self-loathing [ . . . ] ormore typically, an over-emphasis on passing as a non-transgender woman or manand a discomfort when associating with other transgender individuals onto whomfeelings of guilt and self-hatred are projected” (Bockting, Knudson, & Goldberg,2006, p. 46).Yet, there is evidence that transgender people are able to use adaptive strate-gies, such as resilience and social support, in the face of minority stress (Pflum,Testa, Balsam, Goldblum, & Bongar, 2015; Singh, Hays, and Watson, 2011;Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014). Resilience involves the adaptation to risk factorsand the capacity to “bounce back” from adversity, buffering the effects of stresson health, promoting social adjustment, and drawing upon individuals’ inner re-sources (Rainone et al., 2017; Zimmerman, 2013). As stated by Meyer (2015),resilience represents an integral part of the minority stress model because itsmeaning is comprehensible only in its relationship with stress. This is valid alsofor social support, which, due to the buffering effect on stressors, reduces thelikelihood of developing negative health outcomes, making evident the role of re-silience. Considering the evidence of resilience and social support in transgenderpeople, Singh et al. (2011, 2014) found that resilience involves both individualtraits and social characteristics. Among these, they highlighted the connectednessto transgender communities, which was effective in reducing negative outcomesof societal and internalized transphobia. In the same vein, Pflum et al. (2015)found that social support can ameliorate the negative mental health outcomes as-sociated with minority stressors. Thus, resilience and social support may functionas bufferers of the effect of minority stressors on health.Stigma and Mental Health in Italian Transgender PeopleOnly a few studies have focused on minority stress in Italian transgenderpeople. Gerini, Giaretton, Trombetta, and Romito (2009), within a small sampleof 44 transgender persons recruited in a hospital in northern Italy, found that theyexperienced higher levels of prejudice events than the control group of Italiancisgender people recruited in the same clinic. Specifically, before the age of 18,72% of transgender people suffered from psychological abuse compared with37% of cisgender people. However, the authors did not find significant differences566 Scandurra et al.between transgender and cisgender people in mental health problems, or in theeffects of prejudice events on mental health.With regard to resilience, Amodeo, Picariello, Scandurra, and Valerio (2015)theorized the positive role that transgender peer groups can have in developingresilience in facing social oppression within an European Union project aimedat empowering young LGBT people who experienced gender- or sexual-basedviolence. In addition, an empirical study by Amodeo, Vitelli, Scandurra, Pi-cariello, and Valerio (2015) with a small group of Italian transgender individuals(N = 45), found that positive and secure attachment is associated with positiveaspects of transgender identity. However, although some findings about distalminority stress and resilience experienced by Italian transgender people have beenreported (Gerini et al., 2009), they do not address the link between minority stressand mental health, and do not include proximal stressors, with the exception of astudy on internalized transphobia by Scandurra, Amodeo, Bochicchio, Valerio, andFrost (2017a), which evaluated the psychometric characteristics of a scale assess-ing internalized transphobia in a sample of Italian transgender people. They foundthat internalized transphobia was significantly correlated with enacted stigma andmental health (perceived stress, anxiety, and depression). Notwithstanding, thisstudy did not formally assess the minority stress model in this population.The Current StudyThe current study applied the minority stress model to experiences of Italiantransgender people to increase understanding of social factors contributing tomental health outcomes within the transgender population. The Italian socialcontext and climate is not very accepting of transgender people, and in generalof sexual and gender minorities (e.g., Scandurra, Braucci, Bochicchio, Valerio, &Amodeo, in press; Scandurra, Picariello, Valerio, & Amodeo, 2017b). Italy doesnot currently have a law prohibiting transphobic hate crimes and only recently,in 2015, the Supreme Court of Appeal declared that gender reassignment surgerymust not be considered a prerequisite for changing one’s legal gender status.For a picture of the sociocultural context lived by Italian transgender people, seeScandurra et al. (2017a). Due to these social conditions, we expect that minoritystress would represent a useful framework to understand the negative mentalhealth outcomes in Italian transgender people that some Italian studies havepreviously observed (e.g., Colizzi, Costa, & Todarello, 2014; Fisher et al., 2013;Scandurra et al., 2017a). We also expect that these contextual difficulties wouldelicit in this population the inner resources to cope with stigma, making relevantresilience and support within the context of the minority stress experience.This study had two main aims. The first aim was to explore the types of stigmaand the levels of mental health problems experienced by a sample of Italian trans-gender people. The second aim was to test elements of the minority stress model inMinority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 567the Italian context. We hypothesized that minority stressors (prejudice events, per-cieved stigma, and internalized transphobia) would be positively associated withnegative mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation), andthat this relationship would be moderated by specific protective factors (resilienceand social support).MethodData analyzed in the current study are part of a project launched in November2013, entitled the “Trans Life Survey,” an online survey using purposive samplingaimed at assessing the effects of minority stress on the mental health of Italiantransgender people.SampleThe eligibility criteria for participation were: (1) self-identifying with a trans-gender identity; (2) being at least 18 years old (the Italian age of consent); and(3) living in Italy for at least 10 years. No cross-dressers or bigender people tookpart in the survey. For this reason, we have included transsexual and transgenderpeople in the category “transgender.” The sample consisted of 75 transgenderwomen and 74 transgender men. Full demographic characteristics for the totalsample and the sample by gender are shown in Table 1.ProcedureWith the aim of incentivizing participation, 10 participants were drawn bylottery, each winner receiving €100. We asked all of the participants to providetheir personal email on a voluntary basis, guaranteeing that the email would bedisassociated from their data. Participants were recruited via social media (e.g.,Facebook). In addition, Italian NGOs engaging in the promotion of transgen-der rights invited their contacts to take part in the study, facilitating a snowballsampling recruitment procedure.To guarantee the privacy of all participants according to the Italian law196/2003, collected data were protected by a secure gateway to which only thePrincipal Investigator (PI) had access. Once the data were downloaded, the PI re-moved all IP addresses and saved the emails of those participants who voluntarilydecided to take part in the draw in a separate file. It was only after these proce-dures that the PI shared the data with other researchers. The study was designedto respect all principles of the Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles forMedical Research Involving Human Subjects.Twenty-two participants were removed from the sample because their missingdata (range from 57% to 73%) were excessively widespread.

Socio-demographic variables included gender (male, female, and other with specificationMinority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 569required), age, race/ethnicity, level of education, monthly income, marital status,size of community (urban, suburban, or rural), and religious education (yes/no).Prejudice events. We used two measures to assess prejudice events suf-fered by transgender people. We assessed general discrimination using nine itemsthat asked participants whether they had been fired, rejected when they tried torent an apartment, evicted, robbed, experienced trouble in finding a job or in hav-ing access to health services, and vebally, physically, and sexually abused. Thefrequency for each item was measured on a 5-point Likert scale, from 0 (never)to 4 (very often). Each item was directly linked to transgender identity, asking“Considering your transgender identity or expression as the cause, how often haveyou experienced the following situation?” These items were created followingthe scales used by Clements-Nolle et al. (2006) and Bockting et al. (2013). Theinternal consistency reliability of the measure was α = .77.We also assessed everyday discrimination using the Everyday DiscriminationScale (EDS; Meyer et al., 2008). The EDS assesses the frequency of nine typesof day-to-day discrimination experiences: being treated with less courtesy, beingtreated with less respect, receiving poorer services, being treated as not smart,perceiving that people act as if they are afraid of you, perceiving that people actas if you are dishonest, perceiving that people act as if they are better than you,being called names or insulted, and being threatened or harassed. The originalscale asks the participants whether each of the specific experiences was caused bysexual orientation, gender, ethnicity, physical appearance, etc. Due to our specificsample, we asked directly: “In your day-to-day life how often have any of thefollowing things happened to you due to your gender identity or expression?”The frequency of these experiences was measured on a 4-point Likert scale, from“never” to “often.” In the present study, the internal consistency reliability wasα = .91.Perceived stigma. Perceived Stigma Scale (PSS) is a 6-item measure thatassesses the expectations of rejection and discrimination. This measure was basedon a scale developed by Link (1987) to assess stigma of mental illness and adaptedby Meyer et al. (2008) to assess multiple social categories (i.e., gender, race, sexualorientation, etc.). We adapted the scale to the transgender population, asking theparticipants “These next statements refer to a person like you; by this we meanpersons who have the same gender expression or identity as you . . . . We wouldlike you to respond on the basis of how you feel people regard you in terms ofsuch groups.” Respondents indicated to what extent they agreed with statementssuch as, “Most employers will not hire a person like you.” Possible responsesranged from “agree strongly” to “disagree strongly” on a 4-point Likert scale,with higher scores indicating higher levels of perceived stigma. In the currentstudy, the internal consistency reliability was α = .89.570 Scandurra et al.Internalized transphobia. The Transgender Identity Scale (TIS; Bockting,Miner, Robinson, Rosser, & Coleman, 2005; Italian adaption by Scandurra et al.,2017a) is a 26-item measure that assesses positive and negative feelings andattitudes toward one’s own transgender identity. This measure is constituted byfour scales: Pride (e.g., “I am proud to be a transgender person”), Shame (e.g., “Isometimes resent my transgender identity”), Passing (e.g., “Passing is my biggestconcern”), and Alienation (e.g., “I feel isolated and diverse from other transgenderpeople”). The response options ranged from “strongly disagree” to “stronglydisagree” on a 7-point Likert scale. The scale was recoded so that high scores onPride indicated more positive attitudes and feelings toward one’s own transgenderidentity, and a high score on Shame, Passing, and Alienation, indicated higherlevels of internalized transphobia. In the current study, the internal consistencyreliability for the subscales was, α = .84, .89, .86, and .82, respectively.Depression. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale(CES-D; Radloff, 1977; Italian adaption by Fava, 1981) is a 20-item measureassessing depressive symptoms experienced during the past week on a 4-pointLikert scale, from “rarely or none of the time, less than 1 day” to “all of the time,5--7 days.” This scale is able to identify clinical depression and to differentiatedepressed subjects from those who need support for emotional problems. In trans-gender population, the alarm threshold is detected in the clinical cut-off scoreof 16 (Clements-Nolle, Marx, Guzman, & Katz, 2001). In the current study, theinternal consistency reliability was α = .94.Anxiety. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck, Epstein, Brown, &Steer, 1988; Italian adaption by Sica, Coradeschi, Ghisi, & Sanavio, 2006) is a21-item measure assessing anxious symptoms experienced during the past monthon a 4-point Likert scale, from “not at all” to “severely.” In the Italian sample, thealarm threshold is at the clinical cut-off of 13. In the current study, the internalconsistency reliability was α = .95.Suicidal ideation. One question assessed suicide ideation linked to trans-gender identity. Participants were asked whether, due to their gender identityor expression, they have seriously thought about committing suicide. Responseoptions were “yes” or “no.”Resilience. The Resilience Scale (RS; Wagnild & Young, 1993; Italianadaptation by Peveri, 2009) is a 10-item measure assessing the levels of one’s ownresilience on a 7 point-Likert scale, from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.”Example item is “my life is meaningful.” The internal consistency reliability inthe current study was α = .90.Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 571Social support. The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support(MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988; Italian adaption by Prezza &Principato, 2002) is a 12-item scale assessing the level of perceived support on a7-point Likert scale, from “very strongly disagree” to “very strongly agree.” Thismeasure consists of three scales: (1) Family (e.g., “My family really tries to helpme”), (2) Friends (e.g., “I can count on my friends when things go wrong”), and(3) Significant others (e.g., “There is a special person who is around when I am inneed”). In the current study, the internal consistency reliability was α = .93, .95,and .92, for the subscales, respectively.Preliminary and Statistical AnalysesTwo measures—EDS and PSS—used in this study were not previously val-idated in Italy. For this reason, they have been translated into Italian followingall the phases suggested by Behling and Law (2000) related to back-translationprocedures. Before proceeding with the analyses to verify our hypotheses, Con-firmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) with the Maximum Likelihood estimation withRobust Standard Errors were performed with the aim of assessing goodness of fitof these measures using R-Studio. Model fit was assessed through the followingindices (Kline, 1998): Chi-Square (χ2), Root Mean Square Error of Approxima-tion (RMSEA), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), ComparativeFit Index (CFI), and Tucker–Lewis Index (TLI). Specifically, the fit indices of theEDS were χ2/df = 1.74, p = .120; RMSEA = .070; SRMR = .040; CFI = .974;TLI = .962, while that of the PSS were χ2/df = 1.36, p = .226; RMSEA = .049;SRMR = .020; CFI = .995; TLI = .989. Following the suggestions by Hooper,Coughlan, and Mullen (2009), the goodness of fit indices of these measures canbe considered acceptable. In addition, CFA was also performed on the measure ofgeneral discrimination, which had goodness of fit indices that also can be consid-ered acceptable: χ2/df = 1.49, p = .058; RMSEA = .057; SRMR = .052; CFI =.964; TLI = .946.Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were performed with anxietyand depression measures as they were dependent continuous variables. Hierarchi-cal binary logistic regression analyses were performed with the suicidal ideationmeasure as it was a dependent dichotomous variable. In all models of hierarchicalregression analyses, we entered demographics in step 1 as covariates, minoritystressors (prejudice events, perceived stigma, and internalized transphobia) in step2, protective factors (resilience and perceived social support) in step 3, and interac-tion terms between minority stressors and protective factors in step 4. In the currentstudy, each interaction term was tested by adding to the model the multiplication ofone minority stress measure and one protective factor as hypothesized moderator.To avoid problems related to collinearity of interaction terms, each of them havebeen included in separate regression models and scores of independent variables572 Scandurra et al.Table 2.

Itwas not possible to include ethnicity as a control because only two participantswere non-Caucasian.ResultsWe provide results of the analyses in two sections. First, descriptive data abouttypes and level of prejudice events and mental health outcomes are presented.Second, we present results of hypothesis testing, differentiating findings on thebasis of the mental health outcomes measured in the study (i.e., anxiety, depression,and suicidal ideation).Types and Levels of Prejudice Events and Mental HealthThe percentages reported in Table 2 refer to specific types of prejudice eventsthat have been experienced by transgender people at least once. To verify if therewas a difference between transgender women and men, logistic regressions wereperformed with gender as an independent variable. The most prevalent type ofprejudice event was verbal abuse, followed by troubles in finding a job, troublesin having access to health services, physical abuse, troubles in renting an apart-ment, layoff, robbery, sexual abuse, and eviction. All prejudice events were morefrequently reported by transgender women than men, with the exception of ver-bal abuse, troubles in finding a job, troubles in having access to health services,Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 573and eviction, for which no gender differences resulted significant. With regard toeveryday discrimination, we found more everyday discrimination experienced bytransgender women than men. Finally, no significant differences in mental healthby gender were found. The percentages of anxiety (47%) and depression (63.1%)were very high in both groups, as well as suicide ideation (51.7%). Indeed, theseestimates are vastly disproportionate compared to those observed in the generalItalian cisgender population by de Girolamo et al. (2005) as part of the EuropeanStudy on the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders: lifetime mood disorder (11.1%),anxiety disorder (11.2%), and suicidal ideation (3%).Minority Stress and Mental HealthAnxiety. Results for regressions of all mental health measures on minor-ity stress processes are reported in Table 3 . Demographics were not associatedwith anxiety in the first step of the model. Introducing minority stressors in step2 explained 22.8% of variation in anxiety. Specifically, higher scores on every-day discrimination, shame, and alienation were associated with higher scores onanxiety. Adding protective factors in step 3 of the regression model explainedan additional 3.2% of the variation in anxiety. Specifically, higher levels of re-silience and perceived support from family were associated with lower levels ofanxiety. Finally, the addition of the interaction term between everyday discrim-ination and perceived support from family to the regression model explained anadditional 3% of the variation in anxiety. This indicates that family support signif-icantly moderated the association between everyday discrimination and anxiety.Specifically, the association between everyday discrimination and anxiety was sig-nificant under conditions of low support (b = −.24; p < .01) and moderate support(b = −.18; p < .05), but not under conditions of high (b = −.03; p = .19) familysupport. Lastly, the final statistical model for all dimensions accounted for 27.1%of the variance in anxiety.Depression. Demographics were not associated with depression in thefirst step of the regression model. Introducing minority stressors variables instep 2 explained 30.8% of variation in depression. Specifically, higher scoreson everyday discrimination, shame, and alienation were associated with higherscores on depression, while lower scores on pride with higher scores on depression.Adding protective factors in step 3 of the regression model explained an additional12.1% of the variance in depression. Specifically, higher levels of resilience andperceived support from family were associated with lower levels of depression.Finally, the addition of the interaction term between everyday discrimination andresilience to the regression model explained an additional 6% of the variation indepression. This indicates that resilience significantly moderated the associationbetween everyday discrimination and depression.

The final model accounted for 43.1% of thevariance in depression.Suicidal ideation. A logistic regression was performed to examine the ef-fects of minority stressors and protective factors on the likelihood that participantsexperienced suicidal ideation. This hierarchical logistic regression revealed thatat step 1 demographics did not contribute significantly to the regression model.Introducing minority stressors in step 2 explained 21.2% (Nagelkerke R2) of vari-ation in suicidal ideation and correctly classifying 69.4% of cases. Specifically,everyday discrimination and shame significantly increased the odds of ideatingsuicide by almost two times. Adding protective factors in step 3 of the regres-sion model also contributed significantly to the regression model, explaining anadditional 4.1% of variation in suicidal ideation and correctly classifying 72.3%of cases. Specifically, increasing resilience was associated with a reduction in thelikelihood of ideating suicide by almost one. Finally, the addition of the interac-tion term between everyday discrimination and resilience to the regression modelcontributed significantly to the regression model explaining an additional 4.3%of variation in suicidal ideation. This result indicates that resilience significantlymoderated the association between everyday discrimination and suicidal ideation.A further investigation of this interaction indicated that the association betweeneveryday discrimination and suicidal ideation was significant only for those withlow (b = 1.62; p < .05) and moderate levels of resilience (b = .62; p < .05), but notfor those with high resilience (b = −.39; p = .46). The final model explains 29.6%(Nagelkerke R2) of variation in suicidal ideation, correctly classifying 74.1% ofcases.DiscussionThe current study explored types of minority stress reported by Italian trans-gender people, and their mental health outcomes. Results align with those reportedin the literature (primarily U.S.; Bockting et al., 2013; Bradford et al., 2013; Lom-bardi, Wilchins, Priesing, & Malouf, 2001). In general, our findings indicate thatthe minority stress model can be usefully applied to Italian transgender people.Thus, this study contributes to the international literature aimed at understandinghow minority stress is experienced by transgender people and its impact on theirhealth. Indeed, this study’s findings sometimes differ from previous research onminority stress in the transgender population, highlighting the important of testingthe minority stress model across differing cultural contexts. At the same time, thisis the first study which assesses the minority stress model in Italian transgenderMinority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 577people, providing Italian researchers with an overview of the associations betweenstress, resilience, and mental health within this population.Like prior U.S. work, we found high percentages of prejudice events, andthat daily discrimination was higher in transgender women than in transgendermen (Bockting et al., 2013). As suggested by Bockting et al. (2013), this could bedue to the fact that transgender men “pass” more easily than transgender women;transgender men are less easily targeted for overt discrimination, although notprotected from perceived stigma.Regarding mental health problems, we found levels of depressive and anx-ious symptoms and suicidal ideation generally, although not exactly, aligned withpreviously published rates in the transgender population (Bockting et al., 2013;Budge, Adelson, & Howard, 2013; Nuttbrock et al., 2010). Briefly, in our totalsample, 63.1% and 47% experienced, respectively, depressive and anxious symp-toms, and 51.7% suicide ideation. Bockting et al. (2013) and Budge et al. (2013)found depression-related problems in their respective samples at rates of 44.1%and 51.4%, and rates of anxiety at 33.2% and 48.3%. Considering suicide, Nut-tbrock et al. (2010) found that 53% of younger and 53.5% of older transgenderparticipants ideated suicide during the lifespan. Overall, these rates are similarto those observed in our sample. Any differences may be due to contextual ormethodological factors that differed in the specific samples or studies.Our main study findings revealed anxiety, depression, and suicide ideationwere significantly and partially explained by minority stress processes. Everydaydiscrimination was more predictive of all three outcomes than major life events.Meyer (2003b) affirms that many researchers underestimate the importance ofdaily discrimination because it would be linked to subjective perceptions ratherthan the objective reality of the lived event, thus questioning the use of such ameasure as an independent variable of the minority stress model. Nevertheless,these forms of discrimination negatively affect many domains of life. Nadal,Rivera, and Corpus (2010) report many types of daily aggression and harassmentexperienced by sexual and gender minorities during their life-time, correlatingthem with psychophysical health problems.The results support internalized transphobia as an important predictor ofmental health. In the current study, shame was a significant predictor for allmental health variables, while alienation predicted anxiety and depression, andpride predicted depression. This finding is in line with the Hendrick and Testa’s(2012) claims about the detrimental effects that internalized transphobia has onmental health of transgender people, in the same way as internalized homopho-bia for lesbian, gay, and bisexual population. There is also evidence that in-ternalized transphobia is associated with suicide attempts (Perez-Brumer et al.,2015) and lower self-esteem (Austin & Goodman, 2017), but more research isneeded on how transgender mental health is negatively affected by this internalstressor.578 Scandurra et al.Notably, from our results, passing did not predict negative mental healthoutcomes. This finding is in line with results obtained by Bockting et al. (2013). Apossible explanation is that adopting strategies targeted at not being perceived astransgender would represent a useful coping strategy adopted for protection fromadverse outcomes of stigma, rather than a proximal stressor.Finally, the main moderators between stigma and mental health were per-ceived support from family, which protected against anxiety, and resilience, whichprotected against depression and suicide ideation. Only transgender individualswith high levels of family support were protected from the negative effects ofeveryday discrimination on anxiety. Similarly, only transgender individuals withhigh levels of resilience were protected from the negative effects of everydaydiscrimination on depression and suicidal ideation. This indicates the impact ofminority stress on mental health is strong and that family and individual resiliencemight ameliorate it, but only at high levels.As is the case for sexual minorities, perceived social support represents anotable protective factor for transgender population because it is able to facilitatethe management of gender minority stress, increasing more functional ways ofcoping with distress (Pinto, Melendez, & Spector, 2008). It is noteworthy that, inthe current study, among different forms of support, support from family was theonly protective factor. To this end, Simons, Schrager, Clark, Belzer, and Olson(2013), recently found that parental support is linked with a higher quality of lifeamong adolescent transgender people recruited in Los Angeles, being associatedwith higher life satisfaction and lower depressive symptoms. In a recent studyby McConnell, Brikett, and Mustansky (2016), on a U.S. sample constituted by232 LGBT youths aged 16–20 years, youths experiencing lower family supportreported greater distress than those with higher family support. Thus, our findingsseem to be in line with the prior research. Notwithstanding, in the aforementionedstudy by Bockting et al. (2013), authors found that family support was negativelyassociated with psychological distress, but when they considered different formsof support as moderators between enacted stigma and health, they found that onlypeer support was significant. This finding is different from that observed in thecurrent study and it may be due to cultural differences. Indeed, in Italy peopleleave their home at a later age, usually living close to their parents and receiv-ing strong support from them (Santarelli & Cottone, 2009). This general trendcould explain the heightened significance of family support for Italian transgenderpeople.Similarly, resilience demonstrated a key role in moderating the negative ef-fects of stigma on mental health, decreasing the likelihood of developing negativemental health outcomes. This finding is in line with previous research whichhighlighted that transgender people are able to use both individual-level strategies(e.g., fostering identity pride, self-esteem, personal mastery, self-acceptance, andemotion-oriented coping; Grossman, D’augelli, & Frank, 2011; Singh et al., 2011,Minority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 5792014) and collective-level actions (e.g., community participation and activism;Singh & McKleroy, 2011) in order to reduce the negative effects of minoritystress. Similar to the present findings, Breslow et al. (2015) found that resiliencewas associated with lower levels of psychological distress, acting as a moder-ator between minority stress and health. Notwithstanding, in our sample onlyindividual-based resilience was assessed. Future research on the Italian trans-gender population should assess community-based resilience to determine if itgeneralizes to the Italian context. The results of this research would cast lighton how to implement and promote specific changes to social policies that couldpromote community-level inclusion of a stigmatized population such as Italiantransgender people.LimitationsThe current study has important limitations which might affect the gener-alizability of the findings to the entire Italian transgender population. First, thiswas a cross-sectional study which used an online convenience sample. Althoughminority stress theory highlights stigma or minority stress as the cause of men-tal health problems, we cannot rule out the possibility that associations due to athird variable, such as gender dysphoria. Future research should use longitudinaldesigns aimed at assessing the relationship between stigma and mental healthover time, and in particular the development of protective factors to cope withstigma.Second, considering the sample composition, this study reported findings re-lated to individuals who identified with binary gender identities and they cannot begeneralized to trans individuals who identify with nonbinary identities (e.g., gen-derqueer, gender fluid). Along the same line, participants were almost exclusivelyCaucasian individuals and this did not allow exploration of the influence of eth-nicity on minority stress processes. This made it impossible for the current studyto examine whether findings differed across potentially relevant intersections ofrace and gender. This limitation highlights that non-Caucasian Italian transgenderpeople are a hard-to-reach population. To this end, Nuccia et al. (2006) highlightedthat South American transgender people living in Italy represent a highly vulner-able population because most of them are sex workers and at risk of sexuallytransmitted infections and HIV. Prunas et al. (2014), in a study analyzing causesand sociodemographic characteristics of murdered transgender people living inItaly, observed that the large majority of the victims were sex workers from SouthAmerica. On these grounds, it seems to us necessary to assess minority stress,resilience, and mental health at these intersections. Future research should alsoassess and address the barriers to accessibility, adopting different forms of recruit-ment as a result (for a review on the methodological challenges in this researchfield, see Frost, 2017, as well as Smedley & Myer, 2014). A related challenge is580 Scandurra et al.conducting this research in an Italian setting where prejudice event measures (likethe one we used) have not been previously validated in Italy. As such, our findingsrelated to these measures should be interpreted with caution.Social and Policy ImplicationsOur results, aligned with the minority stress model, may have importantimplications in spite of study limitations. The minority stress model was developedto understand better those factors related to the mental health of sexual and genderminorities that are dependent on social contexts and on the internalization ofsocietal attitudes. The Italian context is not highly inclusive for transgender people,that, in one study, reported the second highest rate of transphobic hate crimes(after Turkey; Prunas et al., 2014). As reported by Hatzenbuehler, Keyes, andHasin (2009), living in locations where gender identity protection policies arelacking increases the likelihood for mental health problems. For instance, in thepresent special issue, Hatzenbuehler, Flores, and Gates (2017) examined the healthconsequences for LGBT people living in communities with high or low levels ofsupport for same-sex marriage (see Fingerhut, Riggle, & Rostosky, 2011, andHerek, 2011, for a review of social and psychological implications of same-sexmarriage). They found higher levels of well-being in people living in supportivecommunities, highlighting the effect that local attitudes may have on the health ofLGBT individuals.At institutional and structural level, calling attention to minority stress maypromote change in social contexts often oppressive for transgender people, con-tributing to a more inclusive society. Our minority stress findings, indeed, indicatea need to draft an Italian legislation on transphobic hate crimes. This supportiveand protective social policy would contribute to reducing prejudice derived fromgender nonconformity and institutional bias. Italian policymakers should focuson gender diversity needs, making this population and their needs more visible.Doing so may limit stigma and mitigate the effects of stigma, both of which limitopportunities, resources, and well-being due to social conditions, cultural norms,and institutional policies (Hatzenbuehler & Link, 2014). Promoting change at theindividual level is not enough. Rather, this change should be produced at a moresystemic level along institutional channels, through wide-ranging awareness andtrainings aimed at changing the sociocultural climate.ConclusionsThis is the first study to assess minority stress, resilience, and mental healthin Italian transgender people. The results suggest that everyday discrimination andinternalized transphobia increase depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, andthat perceived social support from family and resilience significantly ameliorateMinority Stress, Resilience, and Mental Health 581the impact of minority stress on mental health. These findings are in line with theminority stress model suggesting that this model can be usefully applied to theItalian transgender population.This study sheds light on the need of promoting resilience and social supportas ameliorating factors through psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing gen-der and sexual minority stress (see Chaudoir, Wang, & Pachankis, 2017, for anoverview of the most efficient psychosocial interventions). Beyond this, social andpublic policy initiatives are needed to understand and reduce forms of stigma (in-dividual, interpersonal, and structural; Link & Phelan, 2006) that are widespreadin transgender populations and that result in negative physical and mental healthoutcomes (White Hughto, Reisner &, Pachankis, 2015).ReferencesAiken, L.

    "abstract": "Transgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity. They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developing mental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model used to understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparities faced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model to the transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minority stress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzing effects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia, and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), on mental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination and internalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems, while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reduced the strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health. Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies",
