    "fullText": "200Diversity Means Justice: Growing Grassroots Library Staff Diversity LeadersJee Davis and Kristen HoganBackground & Literature Review: Motivation for Creating DASIGWe founded the Diversity Action Staff Interest Group (DASIG) at the University of Texas at Austin Librar-ies (UT Libraries) in early 2014 as a way to build on a long history of individual advocacy of library staff witnessing and addressing microaggressions and pat-terns of oppression against people of color, LGBTQ people, and women staff in hiring, evaluation, and promotion, as well as our communities through user service.1 Our library is not alone in facing this chal-lenge; as we discuss in this introductory section, li-brary scholars have documented a national trend of underrepresentation of people of color in academic li-brary staff positions, microaggressions experienced at academic libraries, and students of historically mar-ginalized identities feeling uncomfortable at academ-ic libraries where there are no visual cues indicating organizational awareness and inclusion of historically marginalized communities.Our work together began in 2009 around a proj-ect that informs our DASIG work. In conversation with a faculty member, Kristen proposed and Jee ad-vocated for and built the infrastructure for the Black Queer Studies Collection, a virtual collection using a local note and named by collaborating faculty in the Department of African and African Diaspora Studies. The need for this collection reiterated the importance of visibility and validation; without a way to access some Black Queer Studies materials by a shared name in the Catalog, it would be easy to miss materials with no subject headings, inconsistent or varied terminol-ogy.2 This foundational sense that a library for every-one would work to validate and make visible work by and for historically marginalized communities laid the foundation for our discussions about DASIG.We each brought our own experiences with diver-sity capacity building to the DASIG collaboration as well. While working at the University of Missouri at Columbia, Jee had been a founding member of the Di-versity Action Committee to build staff awareness of and engagement with each other’s racial, ethnic, and cultural differences. In 2013-14, Jee participated as a fellow of the Association of Research Libraries Lead-ership and Career Development Program, a program to support the professional development of librarians of color and which includes analysis of experiences of librarians of color in our still largely white profession. Kristen has experience with antioppression training as a university teacher of Women’s and Gender and LGBTQ Studies at the University of Texas at Aus-tin and at Louisiana State University Baton Rouge. She also has experience coordinating antioppression training for staff as the Associate Director of the Uni-versity of Texas at Austin Center for Women’s and Gender Studies and as a co-manager at the Toronto Women’s Bookstore. Both have experience mentoring information studies graduate students around issues Jee Davis is Head of Cataloging & Metadata Services at University of Texas at Austin Libraries, e-mail: j.davis@austin.utexas.edu; Kristen Hogan is English Literature and Wonen’s & Gender Studies Librarian at University of Texas at Austin Libraries, e-mail: hogank@austin.utexas.edu Diversity Means JusticeMarch  25–28, 2015, Portland, Oregon201of racial, gender, and LGBTQ justice in librarianship. As our experiences demonstrate, librarians are not in-terchangeable: our identities and relationships inform how we do our jobs, our perspectives as we analyze data and write papers, how comfortable historically marginalized students feel approaching us at a desk, and our experiences in our workplaces. Jee identifies as an immigrant, Asian, librarian who is a mother of an inter-racial child and believes in equal rights for all. Kristen identifies as a queer cis-gender lesbian feminist temporarily able-bodied white antiracist ally.As we began talking together about racialized, gendered, disability, and sexual orientation identi-ties at the UT Libraries and in relationship with our campus, we felt a resonance with national conversa-tions about and histories of advocacy for racial, gen-der, disability, and LGBTQ justice. Within librarian-ship, the 2012 Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Racial and Ethnic Diversity Com-mittee published their Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries. This document named a particular responsibility of academic librar-ies to racial and ethnic diversity: “ACRL understands that if libraries are to continue being indispensable organizations in their campus communities, they must reflect the communities they serve and provide quality services to their increasingly diverse constitu-encies.” The authors see the Diversity Standards as a call to action, as “a framework to support libraries in engaging the complexities of providing services to diverse populations, and recruiting and maintaining a diverse library workforce.”3 And library scholars have recently undertaken studies that demonstrate the urgent need for change in academic libraries. In their study of university libraries in 2012-13, Shaneka Morris and Martha Kyrillidou found that librarians of color and indigenous librarians made up only 14.5% of the 8,844 librarians surveyed. Also, these librarians of color largely work on the west, south, and southeast coasts with far fewer librarians of color throughout the rest of the nation.4 Studies of student perceptions of academic libraries by Dallas Long and by Jennifer L. Bonnet and Benjamin McAlexander make the case that students of color find librarians of color more approachable.5 Long points out that Latino students reference a history of experiencing racist and unwel-coming behavior from white people as the motiva-tion for Latino students seeking out perceived Latino librarians, while, as Bonnet and McAlexander find, white students are willing to approach librarians of any ethnic or racial identity. Since, as Long points out, use of libraries is one factor for student success, the underrepresentation of librarians of color on the desk likely negatively affects the success of students of color. Studies of recruitment, hiring, and tenure and promotion of librarians of color indicate a pervasive lack of understanding on the part of largely white in-stitutions about factors involved in hiring and retain-ing librarians of color.6 Studies also demonstrate our field’s need to address barriers to inclusion of LGBTQ librarians and librarians with disabilities.7These defining issues for our profession require a focus on clearly addressing race, gender, LGBTQ identities, and disability both within librarianship and in preparation of all library staff for campus service and workplace interactions. This reparative work will benefit from a foundation in feminist, critical race, and disability studies theories. Such a foundation will help us hone our language and vision for change. For example, despite the studies reviewed above and re-cent statements that demonstrate issues of race, gen-der, LGBTQ identity, and disability require particular action by academic libraries,8 definitions of “diversity” in our field have typically avoided specific mention of these vital identity categories.9 Feminist philosopher Sara Ahmed maps out a genealogy of feminists of color explaining how an emptying of the term “di-versity” has been used by academic institutions for “managing or containing conflict or dissent,” that is, a diversity initiative that does not address historical marginalization “allows racism and inequalities to be overlooked” even while producing a false sense of ac-tion.10 As a case in point, we used the term diversity in our DASIG name in order to make the group seem less threatening to the institution, even as the idea that racial, gender, LGBTQ, and disability justice pos-Jee Davis and Kristen HoganACRL 2015202es a threat indicates the depth of the need for change. We feel constrained by the language of the university. In anchoring our vocabulary and imagining what would become the DASIG, we attended to intersec-tions of power in conversations that resonated with vital foundations for this work. We know that who we are and our relationships with each other influence how we work. Feminist critical race theorist Patricia Hill Collins emphasizes that people from specific his-torically marginalized identities (groups of people of color, women, LGBT people, people with disabilities, and working class people) share experiences that can produce a standpoint not validated by representations in mainstream media or literature. She points out that there is no “best standpoint from which to understand the mechanisms […] of oppression,” but, rather, “[e]ach group speaks from its own standpoint and shares its own partial, situated knowledge.” Our own partial, situated knowledge require connection with others to understand different standpoints and to lean towards a whole picture of our realities, including our UT Li-braries.11 Queer feminist disability studies scholar Ali-son Kafer describes how this might work as she reads Bernice Johnson Reagon’s iconic essay on coalition politics. Reagon, addressing a women’s music festival in Yosemite National Park, frames her address on rac-ism in the feminist movement by pointing out that it is difficult, even painful, for some people to breathe at high altitudes. Kafer points out that this observation must be more than metaphor: “Reagon is theorizing from the disabled body, using her embodied experi-ence of disability—having a physical limitation in a sociopolitical setting that acts as if that limitation were nonexistent, or at least irrelevant—as a springboard for thinking about difference, relation, and politics.”12 That is, when we talk about hiring people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities, we are not talking about hiring people who “look” different from dominant group people and “behave” the same; rather, we are saying that a commitment to hiring and building dialogue with people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities will mean our or-ganizational practices (including workflows, policies, and more) change, that together we create new ways of thinking about our libraries and our futures. As Jee and Kristen talked together, our conversa-tions reverberated with these larger histories of femi-nist, queer, critical race, and disability studies theories, and our experiences within our library felt urgent. We saw the images circulating on the UT Libraries website picture only white-appearing students; we heard from faculty in identity studies programs that new events we had organized around authors of color and in col-laboration with identity studies units on campus were “a nice surprise”; we heard from faculty of color that they had noticed a new library staff member of color in the building and were hoping we had a new Black librarian; we heard from students of color that with-out visual cues to welcome them they felt out of place at the library and they came and went as quickly and infrequently as possible; we heard from staff that they experienced microaggressions around and attributed hiring and promotion decisions to their identities as people of color. Our head of human resources agreed to talk about what a diversity training might look like with our large staff of around 250. We reached out to Dr. Betty Jeanne Taylor, then director of Diversity Ed-ucation Initiatives at the University of Texas at Austin. She agreed to meet together to talk through the train-ings she had coordinated on campus and the commit-ment involved. We decided to raise the diversity train-ing needs to our UT Libraries administration and ask that diversity training be considered for addition to our strategic initiatives. Inclusion of diversity train-ing as a strategic initiative would generate a working group and implementation recommendations. When the diversity training did not make it onto the stra-tegic initiatives list, we hoped that a grassroots staff organization around diversity would demonstrate the widespread need for training and a cultural shift. We took a deep breath; our new journey was just begin-ning.DASIG Foundation and FrameworkWe are aware that many research libraries have in-cluded diversity as one of their top priorities, based Diversity Means JusticeMarch  25–28, 2015, Portland, Oregon203on a recognition of the significance and importance of diversity in higher education. Though there has been a conversation about including diversity as one of the strategic initiatives at the UT Libraries, it has been pushed down on the list due to other strategic priorities. As described in the previous section, we de-cided to pursue a grassroots approach toward diversi-ty, acknowledging the pressing need for staff diversity training in the UT Libraries. We recognized that there are certain activities that we could immediately be-gin implement in order to open up a dialogue among library staff, instead of waiting for library admin-istration to address diversity at the policy level. The philosophy behind the grassroots approach around diversity is that we, as library staff, have a responsi-bility to address the growing need for a new model of providing information services to better serve in-creasingly diverse user communities on campus; to influence library staff and administration to develop various library services and programs to support the information needs of these user communities; and to collaborate with other campus entities that promote and educate around diversity. We believe that we can build leadership among ourselves as staff to become diversity leaders in our UT Libraries. Ultimately, we want to contribute to build a safe and healthy campus environment and influence diversity practices and policies on campus. Jee and Kristen held a series of meetings before launching DASIG. Both of us have previous experi-ence participating in interest groups, committees, working groups, and professional associations, and we firmly believe that the meaningful success of an interest group relies on active participation among the members of the group working toward a shared vi-sion and mission. We had extensive discussions about how to outline the framework of DASIG including the vision, structure, and roles for the membership (see figure 1). In the course of preparing for DASIG, we acknowledged the challenges and issues of the staff group structure, particularly in terms of member par-ticipation. We had witnessed and experienced that the chairs of many staff groups often end up doing all the work due to a lack of member participation. We were convinced that we could create a structure that en-courages individual members to contribute to group FIGURE 1Framework of Grassroots Diversity Staff Organization in Academic Research LibrariesJee Davis and Kristen HoganACRL 2015204discussion and activities, that motivates self-educa-tion to identify diversity issues and challenges in our UT Libraries and articulate solutions, and that helps members embrace individual responsibility for the success of DASIG. To create this type of staff organiza-tional structure seems quite ambitious for a staff inter-est group, but we are certain that a critical component for DASIG’s success is building a solid foundation on which the members can grow their leadership skills and can obtain solid knowledge of diversity matters. We established the structure and membership of DA-SIG based on these considerations. Using the library distribution mailing list we sent out an e-mail to all staff, calling for volunteers. Ten staff members from various library units signed up in January 2014, and DASIG began its monthly meetings in March 2014. Through vigorous group brainstorming exercises, DASIG, which is composed of two chairs (Jee and Kristen) and ten members from across the UT Librar-ies, started structuring the monthly meeting format to facilitate group discussion and exercises. The mem-bers discussed the norms of DASIG to set member expectations and defined certain roles within DASIG. The following list serves as the group’s general guiding principles:• The members respect the norms of the group.  Establishing the norms of the group through group discussion at the beginning of DASIG sets clear expectations among the members, provides a sense of be-longing, and emphasizes individual respon-sibilities as members of the group.• Each meeting should have two facilita-tors and one blogger, and every member is expected to volunteer for these roles.  Rotating the facilitator’s and blogger’s role among the members helps remind the group that everyone is involved in group activities and provides opportunities to play a leading role in group discussion. • Monthly meetings should always be driven by an agenda. The chairs and facilitators are responsible for building a meeting agenda and planning the monthly meetings; the blogger is responsible for the meet-ing minutes.  Agenda-less meetings can be ineffective and fruitless when there are clear goals to be achieved in a workplace. Most importantly, an agenda can enable the members to feel a sense of achievement, which can build morale and confidence in the group. • Each meeting begins with “What I remember from last meeting…” and ends with “…it made me think.”13  This group reflection exercise provides an opportunity for the members to recall the group’s discussion from the previ-ous meeting and share their thoughts from the current meeting with the rest of the group.  • DASIG utilizes different tools for com-munication and to document its activities.  Identifying communication tools for internal and external communication helps document group activities and serves as the group’s archives.14These principles have guided us in governing our monthly meetings effectively and have helped develop diversity leadership among the members. DASIG Self-Education Process and ActivitiesAfter establishing the structure of our monthly meet-ings and defining the roles in DASIG, the members decided to start DASIG with a self-education pro-cess. Though DASIG members were gathered with a strong sense of purpose to bring a conversation about diversity to the UT Libraries and to foster a culture of racial, sexuality, and disability diversity in the UT Libraries we recognized the need for a self-education process to have a clear understanding of the current diversity issues in academic libraries, the UT campus diversity climate, and national diversity movements and activities in librarianship. Jee and Kristen contacted Dr. Taylor to ask if she could provide a workshop for DASIG to begin explor-ing the DASIG self-education. We discussed the fo-Diversity Means JusticeMarch  25–28, 2015, Portland, Oregon205cal points of the workshop and expected outcomes to assist Dr. Taylor to design the workshop. As a result, Dr. Taylor planned and facilitated two workshops for DASIG which have become a foundational piece of DASIG education. The first workshop, held in May 2014, focused on a group discussion to think about how we define diversity, the status of diversity in the field of library science and librarianship, and what diversity-focused changes we want to see in the UT Libraries. As a result of this workshop, the members felt that they had a better understanding of one an-other and were able to grow a sense of optimism to-ward our future diversity work together. The second workshop, delivered in September 2014, provided the members an opportunity to learn about intersections of identities. The premise of intersectionality is “that people live multiple, layered identities derived from social relations, history and the operation of struc-tures of power. People are members of more than one community at the same time, and can simulta-neously experience oppression and privilege.”15 Dr. Taylor brought worksheets to map out the intersec-tions of our identities across various categories of social identity, such as gender, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, race, etc., and asked the members to think about their social identities based on the cat-egories. Through this exercise we experienced the dif-ficulty of categorizing ourselves into multiple social identities and recognized our privileges and disad-vantages measured from these identities. While these two workshops cannot satisfy all of DASIG’s diversity education needs, they did help to provide a starting point for DASIG to explore self-education and help us understand the complexity of diversity matters, issues derived from social identities, and the urgent need for social justice in our workplace.While continuing our group education, we also realized that we had a responsibility (and staff re-quested us) to create diversity activities and recom-mendations for the UT Libraries staff. We divided into small groups to divvy up research topics and started collecting more concrete information about diversi-ty standards and activities in academic libraries and about campus entities that we could collaborate with around diversity efforts. This small group research ex-ercise has helped DASIG define diversity for the UT Libraries, identify future DASIG events and programs for the public, and compile diversity recommenda-tions for the UT Libraries. As part of DASIG diver-sity relationship building as well as self-education, we planned a panel discussion for the DASIG June 2014 meeting. We invited six campus specialists from the Multicultural Engagement Center (MEC), the Gender and Sexuality Center: Serving Women and LGBTQA Communities (GSC), the Campus Climate Response Team, and the Department of African and African Diaspora Studies (AADS). This panel discussion, only open to DASIG members, was an excellent op-portunity to engage diversity matters on campus and to build relationships with campus diversity experts. The DASIG discussion with the panelists reaffirmed how much work needs to be done in the UT Librar-ies in order to provide a safe and welcoming space to our library users and staff in recognition of their race, gender, disability, sexuality, etc.Over a short nine-month period, between March and November 2014, DASIG devoted its efforts to self-education and campus relationship building. The DASIG members were gradually experiencing group bonding and trust-building through intense group discussion and self-reflection. December 2014 was quite a significant month for DASIG. For the first time in the history of the UT Libraries, a diversity staff event was held in the Perry-Castañeda Library, the main library of the UT Libraries, hosted by DASIG. This event was composed of a panel discussion and a workshop, and the event was open to all library staff including student workers. The invitation to this event was sent out via library mailing lists and the response was overwhelming. Staff events are normally under-attended due to the more-with-less staffing model used in UT Libraries, but we received 68 RSVPs and had 64 actual attendees for this event. Five panelists and three facilitators from the newly reorganized uni-versity office of Diversity Education Initiatives did a great job engaging and facilitating discussion about Jee Davis and Kristen HoganACRL 2015206racial and LGBTQ justice, including challenges in our working environment and service to our users.The first year of DASIG was adventurous and pro-ductive. We strived to bring a meaningful conversa-tion to the UT Libraries and to successfully connect with campus diversity experts and units. Though DASIG is determined to help foster diversity and in-clusion in the UT Libraries, we recognize the limita-tions of a staff interest group whose members have other full-time jobs in their units. In February 2015, the UT Libraries welcomed a new Vice Provost and Director of the UT Libraries. Many units and work-ing groups have been preparing reports for our new Director. DASIG saw this as an opportunity and have thus compiled a report summarizing the rationale of DASIG and its 2014 activities. In this report we have also included recommendations to the UT Libraries in order to create an organizational culture of diver-sity for staff and students and to build a reputation for diversity and service on campus.  DASIG Building UT Libraries Reputation across Campus and ProfessionIn addition to the events, research, and recommenda-tions DASIG has built within the UT Libraries, our members have created new relationships across cam-pus and the profession that build the reputation of the UT Libraries. This aspect of the DASIG work dem-onstrates another way that diversity capacity building supports the organization as a whole.Our new relationships on campus have put us in regular dialogue with campus diversity education professionals, have shaped our UT Libraries, and have built our UT Libraries reputation on campus. In Sep-tember we saw an opportunity to build on the con-versations we took part in during our DASIG panel with campus specialists and to propose some of these suggestions to the group of staff planning the new Learning Commons on the ground floor of our main library. In particular, Jee and Kristen focused on the need for gender inclusive bathrooms in the main li-brary and on suggestions from campus specialists to have other visual cues for belonging and inclusion of students of color and LGBTQ students. We met with the campus director of Student Diversity Initiatives and director of the GSC to talk strategy, and we gath-ered information for action. Brett-Genny Janiczek Beemyn, in a report for the Transgender Law & Policy Institute, explains that gender inclusive bathrooms are important “because gender-diverse students are often subject to harassment and violence when using male- or female-specific campus restrooms.”16 Gender inclu-sive, single-stall bathrooms support gender non-con-forming people, people with disabilities, and people with children. Alison Kafer participated in and writes about her work with PISSAR (People in Search of Safe and Accessible Restrooms), founded at the University of California-Santa Barbara in 2003 as a student coali-tion that “explicitly linked disability access with gen-der access, creating a bathroom checklist that assessed a restroom’s disability-accessibility (e.g., door width, dispenser heights, Braille signage) right alongside its genderqueer-accessibility (e.g., functioning door locks, gender-specific signage, location).”17 By 2014, The Huffington Post announced that “gender-neutral bathrooms are quietly becoming the new thing at col-leges.”18 On the University of Texas at Austin campus, the Gender and Sexuality Center (GSC) leadership, staff, and students, had, over its ten years on campus, advocated for the development of new gender-neutral bathrooms and the dedication of existing single-stall bathrooms as gender-neutral bathrooms. By 2014, the GSC list included 49 gender inclusive bathrooms in 29 buildings on the Austin campus.19 While a few of the buildings that house branch libraries are on the list, the main library was not. Our campus specialists had also pointed out that students of color and LGBTQ students experience greater inclusion in spaces that work to create visual cues, representations of people of color and LGBTQ people, in the space.20 Gender in-clusive bathrooms could provide visual cues and pro-vide an opportunity for staff education around gender identity and disability accessibility.The UT Libraries project managers of the Learn-ing Commons building project agreed to meet with us, and they agreed that gender inclusive bathrooms Diversity Means JusticeMarch  25–28, 2015, Portland, Oregon207and visual cues are important for the new Learning Commons. Recent representations of the design of the space, still in construction, show five single-use gender inclusive bathrooms. In another move towards creating vital visual cues, one member of the Learn-ing Commons team connected with the campus spe-cialists (through relationships DASIG had built) and with DASIG members to gather quotes by authors of color and LGBTQ authors (and both) to include these as design elements and visual cues in the new space. Acting here as liaisons between the information our campus specialists have and the work of our UT Li-braries staff, we took a further step to directly connect the two. Two members of the Learning Commons project management team participated in a dialogue about the space at a meeting of our campus Student Diversity Initiatives team, and they continue to be in conversation.Our attempt to influence the UT Libraries also affects our national reputation as well as our capac-ity for change within the organization. In August, UT Libraries staff met for staff question and answer ses-sions with each of the candidates for our new Vice Provost and Director of the UT Libraries. DASIG had submitted to the search committee a statement urg-ing them “to consider candidates with strong track records generating organizational strengths in diver-sity through hiring, promotion, training, and services initiatives.” We sought to offer additional staff support for what we anticipated were already strengths under discussion. All UT Libraries staff were invited to sub-mit questions for the candidates, and Jee and Kristen each asked a question on behalf of the DASIG. Our questions addressed the importance and practice of achieving racial diversity among librarians as well as the importance and practice of building capacity for all UT Libraries staff to work with our communities of color. We hope that these questions are part of a growing public reputation of the UT Libraries work-ing on issues of racial, gender, and disability justice. As a result of this public work, UT Libraries staff come to DASIG members as resources on issues of diversity and campus climate from how to address hate-speech material left behind on a UT Libraries table (we en-couraged a report to our Campus Climate Response Team) to what information we can share with an in-quiring new diversity officer at another library.Challenges and Lessons Learned As we’ve indicated thus far, throughout our first year we have learned through our successes and exciting new relationships. We have also learned through chal-lenges. Here we discuss three recurring challenges to our process and to diversity training at large; we frame these challenges as opportunities in order to make space to imagine creative and generative responses.One challenge has been generally diffuse defini-tions of “diversity”; we see this as an opportunity to think about how to bring social justice organizing into the UT Libraries and librarianship. As we discussed in the first section, workplaces (in particular in the acad-emy) often water down the meaning of “diversity.” In our University President’s introductory letter on the website of our University’s Division of Diversity and Community Engagement, he writes: “America draws much of its strength from its diversity—diversity of color, certainly, but diversity of culture, ideas, points of view, and skills as well.”21 Within our Library staff we hear echoes of this diversion from an important focus on historically marginalized communities; dif-ferences in values, ideas, and communication styles seem to constitute some definitions of “diversity.” At the same time, our University has repeatedly been at the center of national conversations about race-based admissions policies. In 2014 the Fifth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled “in favor of UT Austin,” recognizing as constitutional the University of Texas at Austin’s “consideration of race in admissions deci-sions” for those not automatically admitted under the “Top 10 Percent Law” (which admits the top 10% of each Texas high school graduating class).22 The court argued “that universities may use race as part of a ho-listic admissions program where it cannot otherwise achieve diversity. […] This interest is compelled by the reality that university education is more the shap-ing of lives than the filling of heads with facts—the Jee Davis and Kristen HoganACRL 2015208classic assertion of the humanities.”23 When institu-tions like the court recognize the significance of racial diversity and broader justice for historically margin-alized communities, they offer an opportunity to de-fine “diversity” more specifically. It benefits all of us to address unearned privilege and learn with people of color, working class people, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people. This January, Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, partnered with longtime activist Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow Coalition to create a plan to achieve racial diversity at Intel, and to tie execu-tive compensation, including his own, to the success of this change by 2020.24 By bringing in the Rainbow Coalition, Krzanich acknowledged the capacity of so-cial justice organizers in defining and understanding obstacles to racial diversity. This model for creating new definitions through partnerships between activ-ists and institutions offers an exciting model for our work together.Another related challenge is that, at our first Li-brary-wide staff training on racial and LGBTQ justice with campus specialists, a group of staff committed to disability justice expressed a sense that disability discrimination seems more prevalent at our Univer-sity than racial or LGBTQ discrimination. We see this as an opportunity to enact training in intersection-ality. Activists and social justice educators point out that one common response to discussions of racial discrimination is to move to discussions of class or disability discrimination.25 We want to build our skills in attending to racial, LGBTQ, disability, and socio-economic discrimination, while acknowledging that no one of these identities exists without the others. A Black woman who identifies as straight, for example, experiences racial discrimination differently from a Black woman who identifies as a lesbian, and differ-ently from a Black lesbian who identifies as a person with a disability, and so on. As discussed in the first section, Black feminists, including Patricia Hill Col-lins and Kimberlé Crenshaw, developed the concept of intersectionality to describe this attention to the ways in which differences within historically marginalized communities affect experiences of discrimination and require different institutional changes to address.A third challenge for us has been how to encour-age DASIG members to claim shared leadership in our process; we see this as an opportunity to explore how to build leadership within our organization. Both of us came to this work with a sense of what issues and approaches are important and exciting for us, and we both hoped that we could voice these as members and, as chairs, support all of the members to voice their priorities and approaches. We rotate co-facilitators for our monthly meetings while both of us share the role of holding the overall vision for what the group has decided we want to accomplish. While this approach seems to save time (not everyone must keep up with what has been done and what needs to be done to car-ry out our goals), it does not make the move we want to see towards recognizing the leadership each of us must take to create organizational change. Certainly this has long been a challenge of organizing, and we are seeking a model for the leadership-sharing organi-zational practice we long for.Looking ForwardJust after submitting this paper, we will attend the February DASIG meeting where a campus facilitator will guide us in an assessment of our successes and productive failures in our first year. We hope that this conversation will build a strong foundation for our second year. As we look to the future, we hope for ad-ministrative response to and support for the propos-als our full membership has researched and proposed, we hope that the relationships we have built with other university diversity initiatives will continue to grow and support this work, and we hope to be able to address the challenges listed above with energy and innovation from our current and future members. We have established a foundation to build on and for others, including our incoming new Vice Provost and UT Libraries Director, to draw on to demonstrate how racial, gender, LGBTQ, and disability diversity is vital to hiring, retention, and promotion of staff and to the recruitment, retention, and graduation rate of our students. We began this journey hoping that a Diversity Means JusticeMarch  25–28, 2015, Portland, Oregon209groundswell of grassroots energy would support ad-ministrative movement to work towards racial, gen-der, LGBTQ, and disability diversity in our workplace and diversity competencies in our work. A year later, with well-researched proposals, a first-year cohort, and a stunningly well-attended staff session on our list of accomplishments, we seek to put that list to work for change in our organization.Notes 1. We have not run a study of experiences of oppression; rath-er, we have collected anecdotal narratives together both in individual conversations and at the organized workshops we coordinated through the DASIG, connected these anecdotes with a national literature, and looked to available statistics on racial demographics to put our staff representation in context. Theorists describe racial microaggressions as “brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to people of color because they belong to a racial minority group. These exchanges are so pervasive and automatic in daily interactions that they are often dismissed […] as being innocuous” (Sue et al. 88). Studies have shown that racial microaggressions create a hostile environment that damages the physical and mental health of people of color (Lewis et al. 53). Social justice theorists have also used the term microaggressions to describe such interactions targeting the overlapping identities of people with disabilities, women, and LGBTQ people. Jioni A.

The 2014 joint statement from the presidents of the Ameri-can Indian Library Association, Asian Pacific American Librarians Association, Black Caucus of the American Library Association, Chinese American Librarians Associa-tion, REFORMA, and American Library Association saw the “values of diversity, equity, and inclusion” that “form the foundation of the library profession” in contradiction to the “discriminatory enforcement of the ‘Stand Your Ground’ law in Florida” and committed to action specifi-cally around “racial diversity and inclusion in our profes-sion” at the 2016 ALA in Florida, and the “Statement of Appropriate Conduct at ALA Conferences” issued in 2014 specifically banned “harassment or intimidation based on race, religion, language, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, appearance, or other group status.” “Joint Statement from the Presidents of AILA, APALA, BCALA, CALA, REFORMA, and ALA,” ALAnews, American Library Association, 28 March 2014, http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2014/03/joint-statement-presidents-aila-apala-bcala-cala-reforma-and-ala; American Library Association, “Statement of Appropriate Conduct at ALA Conferences,” 2014, http://alamw14.ala.org/statement-of-appropriate-conduct. 9. The “American Library Association Staff Diversity and In-clusion Action Plan” asserts that “in addition to race, creed, color, religion, gender, disability, and national origin, there are a multitude of differences (language origin, regional and geographic background, economic class, education, learning and communication styles, sexual orientation and personal lifestyle) that individuals bring into their work.” The Diver-sity Standards define “diversity” as the “state or fact of being diverse; different characteristics and experiences that define individuals.” “American Library Association Staff Diversity Jee Davis and Kristen HoganACRL 2015210and Inclusion Action Plan,” American Library Association, 2003, http://www.ala.org/offices/sites/ala.org.offices/files/content/diversity/ALA_Diversity_Action_and_Inclusion_Plan.pdf.10.

Patricia Hill Collins also warns against both tokenism (for example, asking one Black woman to speak for or represent all Black women) and essentialism (for example, considering it possible for one Black woman to speak for all Black women: “No homo-geneous Black woman’s standpoint exists. There is no essential or archetypal Black woman whose experiences stand as normal, normative, and thereby authentic.” Instead, “Since Black feminist thought both arises within and aims to articulate a Black women’s group standpoint regard-ing experiences associated with intersecting oppressions, stressing this group standpoint’s heterogeneous composi-tion is important” (28). Black feminist legal and critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw described the concept of intersectionality as the experience of a person with multiple historically marginalized identities (for example, Black women) “within discourses that are shaped to respond to one or the other” (1244), that is, there are many differences within a particular identity group that affect the sociopoliti-cal situation of people differently.
