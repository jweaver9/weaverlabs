It was an extension of existing studies and inspired by the framework of \nMereish and Poteat’s study in 2015, “A Relational Model of Sexual Minority Mental and \nPhysical Health”. First hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between \nindividuals with non-heterosexual sexual preference and shame. The second hypothesis was \nthat there would be a positive correlation between psychological and physical poor health \nwithin the minority groups. Sexual preferences were examined as the third hypothesis, \nexploring the compatibility between self-identified sexual preferences and assigned sexuality \nusing the Kinsey scale. 144 Participants aged from 18 to 70 years, participated in an online \nsurvey design where they were asked 87 questions. While this study could not confirm the \ntwo first hypotheses, a positive correlation between mental distress and physical symptoms, \nand a significant correlation between the self-identified and the sexual preferences identified \nby the Kinsey Scale were found. Implications of these findings were discussed with reference \nto the complexity of measuring sexual minorities groups, the influence of written instructions, \nchoice of instruments and suggestions are made for future research. \n \nKeywords: sexual minority groups, heterosexuals, sexual preferences, Kinsey scale, shame, \nmental health, physical health \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\t\nSammanfattning \nI denna studie undersöktes de sexuella minoritetsgrupperna, Lesbiska, Homosexuella, \nBisexuella, Transsexuella (LGBT), relation med mental och fysiska ohälsa. Studien var \ninspirerad av Mereish och Poteat’s forskning i 2015, “A Relational Model of Sexual Minority \nMental and Physical Health”, och fokuserade på förhållandet mellan skam, psykologisk och \nfysisk ohälsa. Inom studien undersöktes även sexuella preferenser med användning av \nKinsey-skalan för att titta närmare på beteende i samband med identifierad sexualitet. Den \nförsta hypotesen var att det skulle finnas en relation mellan icke-heterosexuella sexuella \npreferenser och skam, den andra hypotesen var att det skulle finnas en positiv relation mellan \npsykologisk och fysiologisk ohälsa inom de sexuella minoritetsgrupperna. Den tredje \nhypotesen antog en korrelation mellan Kinsey skalan och sexuella preferenser. Dessa \nhypoteser testades via en nät enkät. 144 deltagare mellan 18 och 70 års ålder deltog och \nsvarade på 87 frågor. Denna undersökning kunde inte bekräfta de två hypoteserna. Dock \nfanns ett sammanband mellan psykologiska symptom och fysiska symptom och en positiv \nkorrelation mellan själv-identifierad sexualitet och identifierad sexualitet av Kinsey-skalan. \nSlutsatser och svårigheter diskuteras med reflektion över mätinstrument, och komplexitet av \natt mäta sexuella minoritetsgrupper gällande olika faktorer. Även förslag till framtida studier \noch fokus över vikten av potentiella faktorer och effekter såsom instruktioner och val av \ninstrument.   \n \n \nNyckelord: sexuella minoritetsgrupper, heterosexuella, sexuella preferenser, Kinsey-\nskala, skam, psykologisk ohälsa, fysisk ohälsa \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4\t\n \nIntroduction \nResearch findings have previous found a relationship between mental and physical \nhealth disparities due to emotions and factors such as depression, social-bonds and \nrelationships although all people to a certain degree in their lives experience stressors, the \nsocial stress of belonging to a minority community has been shown to have additive effects on \nhealth. For instance, increased depression, anxiety and physical complaints have been \nreported within sexual minorities (Meyer, 2003; Longhofer, 2013; Mereish & Poteat, 2015; \nSzymanski, 2006). The acknowledgment of health disparities is important for the health of \nminorities, especially for further implementation into work fields such as therapy but also for \nthe medical and legal outcomes of minority groups such as lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntranssexual adults (Mereish & Poteat, 2015; Frey, 2013; Daniel & Butkus, 2015).  \nSexual preferences – a continuum \nAccording to the American Heritage Stedman’s Medical Dictionary, sexual preference \nis defined “The preference one shows by having a sexual interest in member of the same, \nopposite or other sex” (“sexual preferences” n.d. Dictionary.com, 2015). In The Frontiers of \nPsychology, Ryabko and Reznikova described the terminology of preference as “the \nlikelihood of choice” (Ryabko & Reznikova, 2015). Preference implies choice this study \nadopts these definitions. Sexual orientation refers to the sex of those to whom one is sexually \nand romantically attracted (American Psychological Association, 2012). A “person’s self \nconcept of their gender (regardless of their biological sex) is called their gender identity” \n(Lev, 2004, referred to in Molerino & Pinto, 2015). Furthermore the term gender identity, \ncoined in the 1960s, described one’s inner sense of belonging to either of the bivariate \ncategory of male or female (Molerino, & Pinto, 2015). Nowadays however, there are several \ncategories and terms used such as, “monosexual” “lesbian”, “gay”, “plurisexual”, “bisexual”, \n“pansexual”, “queer”, “fluid” and there are still terms coined within the complexity of sexual \nminorities. Sexual identity can include normative cisgender, (individuals who have a match \nbetween the gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies and their personality (“cisgender” \nn.d. Wikipedia, 2015), heterosexuals and non-normative transgender individuals, (individuals \nwhom have a mismatch between their gender they were assigned at birth, their bodies and \ntheir personality) plurisexual and transgender (Galupo, Mitchell, & Davis, 2015).  \nSexuality on a Scale. Alfred Charles Kinsey was a biologist and pioneer in the study \nof human sexuality helping to found the field of sexology. The ”Kinsey Scale” (KS) is a \nhighly recognized Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating scale, developed by Kinsey and his two \n 5\t\ncolleagues, Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin in 1948, after an effort to more accurately \ndescribe individuals’ sexual behaviour and interests (Galupo, Mitchell, Grynkiewicz, & \nDavis, 2014). The scale is based on interviews with individuals with the intention to illustrate \nthat sexuality does not fall neatly into the dichotomous categories of exclusively heterosexual \nor exclusively homosexual. Rather, Kinsey theorized that an individual’s sexual behaviour \nand interests fall along a continuum and are subject to change over time. Hence, the Kinsey \nScale was one of the first attempts to support the diversity and fluidity of human sexual \nbehaviour (Galupo, Mitchell, Grynkiewicz, & Davis, 2014). Additionally, Kinsey and \ncolleagues created a separate category for individuals, which they described as people without \nsocio-sexual contacts and reactions. They called this “Category X”. Moreover, Myra T. \nJohnsson was the first to use the now familiar term “asexual” in 1977 in her categorization of \nasexual including men and women (Van Houdenhove, Gijs, T’Sjoen, & Enzlin, 2014).  \nIn present day, there are a lot of different versions of the 0–6 scale that are potent and \npopular in the way the different scales incorporate a person’s behaviour (e.g., whom they \nchoose to kiss), desires (e.g., whom they fantasize about), and self-identification (the sexual \nidentity the interviewing person state themselves) to mark a sexual identity easy and \nanonymous on the internet. In addition, researchers and non-researchers have created their \nown interpretations of the scale-with examples ranging from whole numbers to choosing from \ndecimal points, all with the aim of exploring sexual possibilities and capturing the fluidity of \nsexual identification markers on their own terms (Drucker, 2011).  \nPossible effects of Shame \nThe concept of a relation between shame and health is not new as the relationship and \nconsequences have been subject to a wide selection of research (Dickerson, Gruenewald, & \nKemeny, 2004; Kim, Thibodeau, & Jorgensen, 2011; Balsam, 2008). Despite this however, \nfewer studies have been conducted that research shame’s associations to health within \nindividuals who belong to sexual minority groups. In their 2015 study, using the minority \nstress model (Meyer, 2003), Mereish and Poteat found that greater feelings of shame \nmediated the relationship between psychological and physical distress within lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transsexual individuals leading to feelings of loneliness and poorer quality \nrelationships.  \nPsychological effects of shame. In her 1971 work, psychoanalyst Helen B. Lewis \ndescribed shame as a “systematize emotion”, and described it as both humiliation and \nmortification. Lewis theorized that it might even be a key emotion accountable for securing \nand upholding the social bonds essential for social life. Moreover it has been found that \n 6\t\nshame, pride, guilt and embarrassment are all social emotions, more specifically referred to as \n“self-conscious emotions” brought together by “self-reflection and self-evolution” \n(Longhofer, 2013). Here shame acts as an emotional response that reveals a damaged self \nduring social threats, and may even result in physiological effects (Dickerson, Gruenewald, & \nKemeny, 2004).  \nDespite a growing acceptance of sexual minority groups, individuals continue to \nexperience negative attitudes from others within their social life and the legal and cultural \nlandscape. This heterosexual norm can become internalized into one’s sense of self, \ndeveloping into a sense of 1internalized heterosexism. As a consequence, negative reflections \nmay become adopted, and the evaluation brings forward a sense of internal, global negative \nattributes to the self (such as “I am bad”), resulting in shame as a self-conscious emotion. \nThese feelings of shame-proness are painful, often resulting in a desire for withdrawal, escape \nor hiding. They can even lead an individual’s rejection of their non-heterosexual identity \nwhereby they perceive that they are inferior to heterosexuals (Chow & Cheng, 2010; \nHequembourg & Dearing, 2013). In a situation when a sexual minority feel inferior and the \ncurrent situation is evaluated as unchangeable, individuals are likely to resort to negative \ncoping strategies such as, avoidance responses and escapism.  \nPhysiological mechanism of shame. Researchers have also documented elevated \nlevels of substance abuse associated with identity-related stigma; in turn resulting is shame-\nproness (Hequembourg & Dearing, 2013). As a bodily response shame is a somatic event, \nmediated through the autonomic nervous system to the subcortical emotional related brain \nregions in the limbic system, such as the amygdala, and is processed without the complex \ninvolvement of the cortical brain. Therefore the automatic response of fight, flight or freeze is \ncommonly a reaction to the pain and lament of shame (Roth, Kaffenberger, & Herwig, 2014; \nLonghofer, 2013). Awareness of the mechanism of the somatic dynamics in shame is \nimportant when working with (LGBT) clients, especially since the shame responses are \nreactions that cannot easily be switched off. It may be hard to talk oneself out of theses \nextremely shame-saturated states especially as some clients may present themselves with a \nsense of rejection or that they are somehow flawed or damaged and it is then important that \nthe clients will regain a sense of self-worth and belonging (Longhofer, 2013).  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\tInternalized heterosexism; is internalized sexual stigma. This is a self-directed prejudice, when the individual \naccept and agree with societies negative judgement of homosexuality, and can be referred to as internalized \t\n 7\t\nA social perspective. Thomas J. Scheff, also influenced by Lewis, suggested a Grand \nTheory of Shame from a sociological perspective. According to Scheff, shame is a negative \nevaluation, a result from viewing the self from the perspective of the other, building a \ndynamic of a judgement of the self by the self, even 2self-stigma (Longhofer, 2013). He also \nadopted Erving Goffman’s concept of “impression management” which refers to the \nconscious or unconscious process in which a person tries to influence the perception of \nanother person (Longhofer, 2013). LGBT clients may sometimes have a ridged wall built-up \naround themselves whereby impression management is used as a precaution from potential \nthreats to their situation in a relationship and with social bonds, especially where shame and \n3sexual stigma may results from societal rejection. The threat to this bond can produce \nmortification leading to the subject’s decision to keep their stigmatized position hidden from \nothers for fear of shame (Longhofer, 2013). It is argued that when sexual desire, sexual \norientation or gender identity is a consideration, shame as an emotion may be one factor \nwhich when researched may highly contribute to the field of psychology because of its \nemotional importance (Longhofer, 2013). \nPossible psychological effects experienced as a minority member \nLesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals often endure different forms of \ndiscrimination, stigma, bullying and prejudice in various areas such as employment, education \nand health care but also in relationships such as family and other meaningful interpersonal \nrelationships (Molerino & Pinto, 2015; Meyer, 2003). In 2003, Ilan H. Meyer proposed the \nminority stress model, a prominent conceptual framework mounted to understand the excess \nin prevalence of disorder in terms of minority stressor, explaining the hostile and stressful \nenvironments experienced from a member from a stigmatized minority group, which may \nlead to mental health problems as mentioned above (Meyer, 2003).  \nConcept of stressors. Developed from both sociological and social psychological \ntheories minority stress refers to alienation, lack of social control and a sense of normlessness, \nand from the social psychological theoretical perspective understanding the intergroup \nrelations and the impact a minority position may impose on health. The concept of minority \nstressors, as additional distressors to minority groups, have a few underlying assumptions \nagreed by researchers. First, uniqueness – as it is additive to general stressors, experienced by \nall individuals, so as people already struggling with stigmatization will require a adaptation \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n2 Self-stigma; when the negative attitude manifest against oneself and become internalized. (Herek, Gillis & \nCogan, 2009) \n3 Sexual-stigma; expressed behaviorally through actions such as ostracism, awareness of the hetero normative \nexpectations and therefor the LGBT individual may constrict their behaviour and conceal or deny their identity.  \n 8\t\neffort on top of what is required in a situation compared to the other person whom is not \nstigmatized. Second assumption is chronic – as the minority stress is related to rather stable \nunderlying social and cultural structures, and thirdly, socially based –it stems from structures \nbeyond the individual such as institutions and social processes rather than non-social \ncharacteristics such as biological, genetic or conditions like general stressors and individual \nevents (Meyer, 2003).  \nAdditional sexual minority stressors. The Minority stress model suggests both distal \nand proximal stressors, where distal stressors refer to external stressor (such as antigay \nharassment, discrimination) related to the sexual minority identity that can affect the minority \nmember. Proximal stressor relate to the internalization of sexual prejudice, concealment in the \nmembers life (such as internalized homophobia or concealment of one’s sexual orientation), \nthe personal processes (Meyer, 2003). In the study from 2003 Meyer stated that stigmatized \nminority individuals who experience prejudice or discrimination will continue to expect \nnegative judgements from members of the dominant culture, and will therefore become \nchronically anxious for this reaction.  \nMereish and Poteat found in their study 2015 that both distal and proximal stressors \nwere associated with psychological distress through both intrapersonal and interpersonal \nrelationships. Furthermore, LGBT minorities wrestling with their sexual desire and gender \nidentity are more likely to have a sense of loss of connection with their social bond, as it has \nbeen shown that proximal stressors, (e.g., internalized homophobia) mediate the relationship \nbetween distal stressors (e.g., discrimination), health and also shame (Mereish & Poteat, \n2015; Meyer, 2003).  \nSexual communities. The term sexual stigma refers to the negative regard, inferior \nstatus and inherent is a common knowledge that anyone associated with non-heterosexual \nbehaviours, identity or relationships are devalued relative to heterosexuality (Herek, Gillis, & \nCogan, 2009). Structural sexual stigma, heterosexism is an embodied ideology in social \ninstitutional practices and in ideological systems and is relatively free from prejudice, as most \npeople presume heterosexuality and when sexual minorities become visible they are assumed \nto be unnatural, requiring explanation and deserving of discriminatory treatment (Herek, \nGillis, & Cogan, 2009). Moreover Bosson, Haymovitz, and Pinel (2004), discovered that \nwhen gay men were reminded of negative stereotypes conjoined with their identity, they \nshowed higher anxiety behaviour (e.g., biting nails, nervous smiling, etc.) compared with \nother gay men who were not reminded of these negative stereotypes linking sexual stigma \nwith mental distress (Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015), and studies suggests that bisexual \n 9\t\nindividuals may also experience a dual minority status by experiencing discrimination and \nstigma from both the heterosexual and homosexual communities, which have lead to high \nlevels of daily stress, psychological stress, depression and substance abuse (Figueroa & \nZoccola, 2015; Szymanski, 2006).  \nFindings indicate that sexual minority groups (LGBT) experiencing internalized \noppression may relate to shameful feelings, which may lead the individual to perceive \nthemselves as unworthy of relationships. These feelings can become internalized and lead to \nfeelings of loneliness and they can be deleterious as the sexual minorities might feel \nstigmatized and lonely in the heterosexist culture but they might also feel isolated from their \npeers in the LGBT community where they may otherwise feel as a place of belonging where \nresearch indicate to have negative health effects on sexual minority individuals (Mereish & \nPoteat, 2015) \nPhysical implications from possible negative emotions and self-evaluations \nIn a study by Dickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004, they proposed in their “social \nself preservation model” that emotions such as shame and other negative self-evaluations \nevoke psychobiological changes, such as an increase of proinflammatory cytokine activity \nand cortisol, when an individual sense threats on social-self. These onsets of cortisol \nproduction is the end product of the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical \n(HPA) axis, which plays an regulatory part in normal physiological functioning, such as \nregulation of cortisol that have an important role in metabolism, immune functioning and also \npermits the sympathetic nervous system to function effectively. These social-self threats are \nsituations that provide potential situations for a loss of social esteem, social status or social \nacceptance and are characterized by potential or explicit rejection. Constant experience of \nshame-related cognitive and affective states predict immunological diseases and health \noutcomes (Dickerson, Gruenewald, & Kemeny, 2004).  \nIn their study Hequembourg & Dearing, (2013) found strong associations between \nshame-proness and alcohol severity when they examined interrelations among gay, lesbian \nand bisexual men and women. As well as their study showed that shame-proness was \npositively associated with cocaine and opiate dependence and severe marijuana and cocaine \ndependence. Legal complications, has also been found to cause mental and physical distress \nwhen a same-sex parent is refused to see a minor while in hospital as a result from situations \ncaused by prohibitive hospital visitation or refused to take medical decision depending on \nlegal laws faced by same-sex marriage bans. Additionally, exclusion of transgender health \ncare, both private and public can force someone to seek treatment options through illegal \n 10\t\nchannels (Daniel & Butkus, 2015). Policies and laws that reinforce marginalization, \ndiscrimination, social stigma or rejection of LGBT individuals by families, communities or \nhealth care have be associated with higher rate of anxiety, suicide and substance or alcohol \nabuse (Daniel & Butkus, 2015). \n \nAim and Hypothesis \nThis current study, aim to further confirm and build on the relationship between sexual \nminority groups of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT), and mental and physical \nhealth and also to extend the generalizability by targeting individuals globally through social \nmedia. The study will examine shame, depression, anxiety and stress and possible \nphysiological symptoms as they have been presented to have a relation to sexual minority \ngroups. Additionally sexual preferences will be analysed with the Kinsey Scale in order to \ninvestigate sexual preferences on a continuum scale, to examine the terms heterosexuals and \nnon-heterosexuals. First hypothesis: A relationship will be found between sexual minority \ngroups and shame. Second hypothesis: A relationship between psychological and physical \ndistress within the sexual minority groups will be found. Third hypothesis: A positive \ncorrelation between sexual preferences and the Kinsey scale will be found. \n \nMethod \nParticipants  \nParticipants in the study consisted of 144 individuals whom identified themselves as \n76 = Female, 34 = Male and three individuals as Non-Binary. (Mage = 35.28, age span: 18-70 \nyear, SD = 9.59). The continents spread was 42 % Scandinavian, 13 % European, and 6 % \nNorth/South American, 15 % Australasia and 3 % Asians. The participants identification of \ntheir sexual preferences were; 54% heterosexuals, 6% trysexual, 14% bi/pan-sexual, 22 % \ngay, 2% other and 1 % asexual. 144 participants started the questionnaire, whereby 113 \nparticipants completed the full survey, giving a completion rate of 75%. \nProcedure \nParticipants represented a convenience sample, and data was collected using two \nmethods. Firstly the survey was posted on several different social pages on Facebook \ntargeting mainly LGBT groups and communities, with a short introduction stating the purpose \nof the study with the link into Survey Monkey. Secondly, the same link was also presented for \nthe availability for further sharing by and with friends on Facebook thus employing the \nsnowball method, targeting minority groups. The study consisted of a six-page web survey, \n 11\t\nwith four different established measurement scales equal a total of 87 items. The survey \nstarted with a presentation letter, entailing an introduction from of the examiner and a \ndeclaration of purpose of the study, participants were also explained their rights, ethics, age \nrestriction.  \nAfter reading the presentation letter the participants clicked on the continue button \nwhereby the survey included measurements, with the first scale aim to measure sexual \npreferences, such as the selected Kinsey scale (Helloquizzy n.d., 2014) whereby all of the \nitems were created with the intention of examining the sexual preferences of Gay, Lesbian, \nBisexual and Asexual individuals. This study will call those scores, the Kinsey continuum \nscore. Second measurement tool aimed to measure the level of shame of the participants with \nthe established PFQ2 scale (Harder & Zalma, 1990). The third measurement aimed to \nmeasure the mental state of the participants, is the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress \nScale, (DASS) (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), aimed to measured health factors in \npsychological distress, and assess symptoms of depression and anxiety over the past three \nmonths. Last measurement was the 33-item Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical \nSymptoms scale (CHIPS; Cohen & Hoberman, 1983). On the second last page, of the survey, \nitem number 84 asked participant to identify their gender identity as woman, man and other as \noptions, item 85 asked for country and item 86 their ethnicity and last item, 87, for their age \nwhere the last page thanked the individual for their participation. All the questions were \nobligatory (if not all items were filled in participation could not proceed) and all up, the \nsurvey took about ten minutes to complete. \nInstruments \nOnline Survey. The survey was constructed online via a company called Survey \nMonkey, which provided customized questionnaire options, for a fee the service provide the \nsample collection tools, and directions regarding anonymity and distribution options.  \nKinsey Scale. This particular version of the scale was designed by kinseyscaletest, \n(Helloquizzy n.d., 2014). All of the items were created with the intention of examining the \nsexual preferences of gay, lesbian, bisexual and asexual individuals. An item could read as \nfollows “I have had sexual intercourse or oral sex with someone of my same sex”, and the \nanswer options were presented on a likert scale ranging from “Never (not a virgin)”, “once or \ntwice”, “sometimes”, “often”, “exclusively”, “I will never have sex” and “I am a virgin”.  \nTo examine the Kinsey scale, individual score were put together to follow scoring to \nproceed from Kinsey heterosexual and homosexual scale. When a question as “I have had sex \nwith ANOTHER sex” the scale answer was a 0, to indicate never towards the direction of \n 12\t\nheterosexuality on the continuum scale. “I have had sex with the same sex”, exclusively was \nscored with 4 points towards the direction of homosexuality. If a person indicated, “I am a \nvirgin” or “ I have never had sex” the answer was scored as 0, not to effect the total score of \nthe individual on the continuum scale. The total sum were added up and divided by seven, \nincluding reverse scoring and the participant would then fall on a scale between 0 to 6 \nwhereby 0 = “exclusively heterosexual”; 1 = “predominantly heterosexual, incidentally \nhomosexual”; 2 = “predominantly heterosexual, but more than incidentally homosexual”; 4 = \n“predominantly homosexual, but more than incidentally heterosexual”; and 5 = \n“predominantly homosexual, incidentally heterosexual” and 6 = “exclusively homosexual”. \nAs to follow Kinsey’s approach asexual category was separate, with the total score of 0 to \nindicate absolute no sexual interest.  \nAll of the questions were obligatory and final score will be called the Kinsey \ncontinuum score. The first question of the Kinsey scale asks the participant to select from \n“Straight”, “Gay”, “Bisexual/Pansexual”, “Trysexual”, “Asexual” or “Other” whereby this \nstudy will refer their selection as the participants sexual preference for the purpose of the \ncurrent study. No previous information or records were to be found regarding the reliability, \nin this current study the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .79. \nShame scale. Second scale used to measure feelings of shame and guilt were the \nPersonal Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ2) by Harder and Zalma, 1990. Participants were \npresented with 16 items with the following instructions “Please choose the statement that best \ndescribes you in regards to your sexual preferences” (e.g., humiliated or a guilt feelings; \nremorse) response options were on a 4-point likert scale, ranging from “never experienced the \nfeeling” to “experience the feeling continuously or almost continuously” where the participant \nhad to select on option with the total score of 64. The PFQ2 Shame scale has shown \nrelationships with public social anxiety, self-derogation and social desirability (Harder & \nZalma, 1990 & Mereish & Poteat, 2015). Previous research have demonstrated significant \nrelationships with depression and private self-consciousness. Furthermore, in Mereish and \nPoteat (2015), the PFQ2 Shame the Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .91. In current study, the \nCronbach’s alpha coefficient was .86. All of the questions were obligatory. \nDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. The Depression and Anxiety and Stress Scale-\n21 (DASS) created from extensive research by Lovibond and Lovibond in 1995 was the third \nscale in the survey. DASS consists of 7 depression, 7 anxiety and 7 stress -items, aimed to \nmeasured health factors in psychological distress, and assess symptoms of depression and \nanxiety over the past three months. Participant responses were on a 4 point scale from 0 = \n 13\t\n“Did not apply to me at all to” 4 = “Applied to me very much, or most of the time” total score \nof the scale was 84. Previous studies have psychometrically validated the scale (Crawford & \nHenry, 2003; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995; Mereish & Poet at, 2015) With Cronbach’s alpha \nreliability coefficients .86 for depression and .94 in the anxiety in Mereish and Poteat, 2015. \nIn current study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .89 for depression, .79 in the anxiety \nand .86 in stress scale. Also .92 in the total DASS scale. All of the questions were obligatory. \nPhysical distress. To assess physical distress symptoms the fourth instrument used \nwas the 33-item Cohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical Symptoms scale (CHIPS; Cohen & \nHoberman, 1983). The item were introduced with the text to the participants ‘Please choose a \nstatement that best describes the amount you have experienced the following situation/s \nduring the past two weeks including today’ Example items could be ‘Sleep problems’ or ‘ \nHeadache’ where their answers were on a 5-point likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 \n(extremely) with a total score of 132. Previous studies using this scale with minority samples \nhave reported high reliability coefficients with Cronbach’s alpha reliability .95 in Mereish & \nPoteat, 2015 study. In current study, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .93. All of the \nquestions were obligatory. \nExamining data. The analyses started with inspecting data through descriptives for \nverification of assumptions, cleaning and model diagnostics. By checking trimmed mean, \noutliners were found and the highest outliners were recoded by choosing to rate the extreme \nvalues one step down, still indicating highest score. To determine if the data was normally \ndistributed, scores were examined with the normality test with plots, using Shapiro-Wilk \nresult for normality. The Kinsey Scale tested p = .000 Sig. demonstrating positive skewness \n.459 and -.568 kurtosis, a non-normal distribution curve, indicating the use of non-parametric \ntests as well as the Shame scale (PFQ2) with p = .000 Sig, 1.246 skewness and 4.041 kurtosis. \nThe psychological scale (DASS) was tested with Shapiro-Wilk for normality showing p = \n.005 Sig. .641 skewness and .221 kurtosis, furthermore, the physical scale (CHIPS) also \nindicate on the use of non-parametric tests after testing and Shapiro-Wilk p = .000 Sig. .954 \nskewness and .658 kurtosis.  \nTherefore, the conclusion was made that relevant data was non-parametric. Chi-\nSquare of independence cannot be performed since data was on a likert scale, ordinal data and \ntherefore the assumptions are violated. Standard regression model is not possible because the \nresponse data is non-parametric, and not a bivariate logit model since there are more than two \npossible outcomes, to examine for interactions.  \n 14\t\nMissing data and possible transformation. The amount of missing data was 22 %, \nsince all the questions were obligatory when a participant did not fill in a subsequent question \nthe participant could not proceed in the survey leading to statistical shortfall, therefore the \nmissing values. Out of the respondents 54.2% of the participants identified themselves as \nheterosexuals and 45.8% identified themselves within the different minority groups, LGBT. \nCollection of data at the Kinsey scale started with N =144, after the PFQ2 scale there was \n14.6% missing values with a completion of N = 123. After DASS, Depression, Anxiety and \nStress scale, 16.7% (N = 120) of values were missing with 21.5%, of missing data CHIPS, \nCohen-Hoberman Inventory of Physical Symptoms scale, the final of N = 113 of completed \nsurveys. Exclude cases pairwise was chosen to store data collected and include the cases \nwhen cases have the necessary information and only exclude when the data was missing for \nrequired specific analysis.  \nFurther robustness test such as data transformation using squared or log transformation \nwere considered. However, since data transformation is controversial the examinator decided \nnot to include it.  \nData Analysis. Data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22 (2013). The \nstudies significance level was 5%, a p-value under .05, p < .05 and analysed with Non-\nparametric Spearman´s rho to analyse for correlations, and Mann-Whitney U the non-\nparametric alternative to the t-test of independence samples, which compares medians to test \nfor differences between two independent groups on a continuous measure.  \nEthics. At the very start of the survey a presentation letter entailing an introduction \nabout the examiner and a declaration of purpose of the study were presented. Here, the \nparticipants were explained their right of withdrawal at any time, ethics regarding anonymity \nand that importance regarding that there were no right or wrong answers, age restriction and \nalso clear contact details in case there were any future questions. In regards to anonymity the \nparticipants answers went straight into the pool with the other surveys leaving no trace of \nwhom had answered what and from where. \n \nRESULTS \nTo examine the first hypothesis, a relationship between the mediated factor of shame \nand individuals with non-heterosexual preference, the relationship was investigated using \nSpearman´s rho. There were no significant relationship to report between the two variables \nindividuals with non-heterosexual sexual preferences (as measured and stated by the \nparticipant) and the total shame score (as measured by the PFQ2 scale), r = .177, n. = 144, p > \n 15\t\n.199. Then the relationship where examined with the Kinsey’s continuum score (as measured \nand identified by the whole Kinsey scale) and the total shame score (as measured by the PFQ2 \nscale) also investigated using Spearman´s rho, r = .049, n = 144, p > .593. No correlation was \ndetected there either. \nFurther exploring the first hypothesis, regarding the relationship between the mediated \nfactor of shame and individuals with non-heterosexual preference, an investigation to see if \nthere would be any differences between the heterosexual group and the sexual minority \ngroups on the mediating factor of shame was examined by conducting a Mann-Whitney U. \nHowever, the Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant difference in shame levels (PFQ2) \nbetween heterosexual (Md = 58.43, n = 64) and minority group (Md = 65.87, n = 59) U = \n1660, z = -1.16, p =.25, r = .07. By further checking the difference, split files was performed \non the two groups to compared the medians, but no differences were shown between groups \nas both hade a Median of 6. \nThe second hypothesis, stated that there would be positive a correlation between the \nminority groups (lesbian, gay, bi/pan –sexual, asexual or other) and the psychological (as \nmeasures as DASS) and physical health (as measured as CHIPS), a correlation using \nSpearman´s rho indicated no relationships between the minority group and DASS, r = .158, n \n=120, p < .085 or between the minority group and CHIPS, r = .130, n =113, p < .172. To \nfurther expand on the second hypothesis, a difference between the psychological state with \nminority compared to the heterosexual group was also examined by Mann-Whitney U test, \nhowever the test revealed no significant difference between Depression, Anxiety or Stress \nbetween the grouping variables heterosexuals (Md = 55.39, n = 64) and minority (MD = \n66.34, n = 56) U = 1465, z = -1.721, p > .085, r = .11. Mean rank was 55.39 within \nheterosexuals and 66.35 within minority groups, and when tested with split file showing a \ndifference in median between DASS total score as heterosexual had 18.50 and the non-\nheterosexual groups 23.50. \nThe CHIPS scale was also investigated with the Mann-Whitney U, the test revealed no \nsignificant difference in the physiological levels between the heterosexual group (MD = \n52.89, n = 58) and the minority groups (MD = 61.34, n = 55) U = 1357, z = -1.371, p > .170, r \n= .11. Mean ranks was 52.89 within heterosexuals and 61.34 within the minority groups, by \nfurther explore the relationship split file was performed to compare the two groups median, \nwhere heterosexuals had a median of 18 whereas the non-heterosexual groups had 25 in \nmedian. \n 16\t\nA correlation was investigated with Spearman´s rho between total score of the Depression, \nAnxiety and Stress Scale (measured as DASS) and the total score from the Cohen-Hoberman \nInternalized Physiological Scale (measured as CHIPS). Results indicated a significant large \npositive correlation between psychological health and physiological health, r = .657, n =113, \np < .000 at 0.01 level (2 – tailed).  \nThe DASS scale further by examining each of the three subscales, the Depression \nsubscale, Anxiety subscale and the Stress subscale. They were correlated with the Cohen-\nHoberman Internalized Physiological Scale (measured as CHIPS). Firstly, the Depression \nsubscale and the physiological scale (CHIPS) were measured, showing a positive relationship, \nindicating a large strength of the relationship, r = .523, n = 113, p < .000 and the amount of \nvariance shared is 27 per cent. Secondly the Anxiety subscale and the physiological scale \n(CHIPS), there was a large strength of the relationship, r = .639, n = 113, p < .000 here the \namount of variance shared of 41 per cent. The Stress subscale and the CHIPS scale as well \nindicating on a large strength of the relationship, r = .534, n = 113, p < .000, with the amount \nof variance shared by the two variables of 29 per cent. All of the results show a positive \ncorrelation between the mental state scales and physiological health, indicating that the \ngeneralization regarding the relationship between mental and physical health to be confirmed. \nTotal results shown in Table 1. \n \nTable 1.

As \nshown with Depression and all sexual preferences, r = .139, n = 120, p > .129 all at (0.01 \nlevel 2-tailed) and Anxiety and all sexual preferences, r = .064, n = 120, p > .485, and last the \nStress subscale and all sexual preferences, r = .162, n = 120, p > .078.  \nTo look further into sexual preferences between sexual preferences and the Kinsey Scale \ncontinuum scale Spearman´s rho correlation showing, r = .712, n = 144, p >.000, indicating a \nlarge positive correlation. Correlations are shown in Table 2. where frequencies of the total \namount of participants in each cell represent the correlation between sexual preference \ndefinition by the participant and the Kinsey continuum scale where the definitions are more \nnuanced. Furthermore, in Table 3. Presented after the references, the same correlation \nbetween sexual preferences and the Kinsey continuum scale are demonstrated. Where the \nself-identified sexual preferences are shown in colour and placed where they fall on the \nKinsey’s continuum scale. Further elucidating the continuum of sexual preferences by \ndemonstrating the nuance of a “category”. \n \n \nTable 2.

There was no relationship found between \nshame and minority groups, and no correlation between psychological and physical health \nwithin the non-heterosexual groups either. However, comparing the heterosexual group and \nthe non-heterosexual groups, a difference between their psychological and their physiological \nhealth were shown, indicating a higher prevalence to both mental and physical symptoms \nwithin the non-heterosexual groups yet not significantly strong enough to reject the null \nhypothesis.  \nPerceived mental health (measured with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; \nDASS) and the physiological health (measured with Cohen-Hoberman Internalized \nPhysiological Scale; CHIPS) did show a significant strong correlation between depression, \nanxiety and stress with poor physical health, strengthening the hypothesis that mental and \nphysical health does interact and can affect each other in poor health. Examining the sexual \npreferences did also show that sexual preferences fit into the Kinsey continuum scale but is \nmore nuanced when examining the behaviour a participant categorizing themselves as \nheterosexuals. Interesting findings were made in terms of sexual preferences, as the \ncorrelation did indicate that sexual preferences did show a relationship with the Kinsey \ncontinuum scale. Almost consistently in every same-sex Kinsey item when a question asked \nthe participant if they have or have had any type of sexual desire towards the same sex more \nthan 50% of heterosexuals indicated that they had, furthermore, 14% have had sex with the \nsame sex and 1% answered that they had never thought about what it would be like to have \nsexual intercourse or oral sex with someone of the same sex.  \nResult discussion \nAn interesting study has been made regarding a personality trait called psychological \nhardiness. This trait is characterized by control, commitment, and challenge and has been \nconsidered, when examining LGBT health, as an individual difference. This difference \nbestows risk and resiliency for stigma consciousness and possible effects (Figueroa & \nZoccola, 2015). In their study Figueroa and Zoccola (2015) examined factors that showed that \na relationship between greater stigma consciousness and more physical symptoms depended \non the level of hardiness. Results showed that LGBT individuals with low hardiness and high \nstigma consciousness reported being bothered the most by physical symptoms. The \nPsychological hardiness have been found to have an impact on individuals independent from \n 19\t\nstress, as individuals with a higher sense on the hardiness have better mental and physical \nhealth as they are more inclined to engage in health promoted behaviour such as maintain a \nhealthy diet and exercise (Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015).  \nAnother web based study conducted in 2014 by Shilo and Mor, assessing mental \nhealth, physical and sexual risk behaviour in 952 Israeli participants aged 12 – 30, found that \nadolescents (under age 18) reported higher levels of mental distress and that 60 per cent of \nparticipants that engaged in high levels of physical risk behaviours were young adults (Shilo \n& Mor, 2014). They concluded that age might contribute to outness and belonging to a LGB \ncommunity. They also concluded that the support of family and friends has a positive effect \non their mental health. Additionally, as the study took place entirely online – and as a result \nall health measures were self-reported – these responses may not accurately reflect current \ndiagnoses. \nAs sexual stigma may is linked to shame, there may be a possibility that both \npsychological hardiness (as the LGBT participants were recruited from a sexual minority \ncommunity Facebook site) as well as the median age of the participants (which were 34 years \nold) may be possibly mediate factors in the present findings of this study. As age and \ncommunity support play a positive roll in mental and physical health (Longhofer, 2013; Shilo \n& Mor, 2014). Furthermore, the participants of this study may be LGBT respondents from \nFacebook that may already be “out” and accepting their identity, as members from an \nestablished minority group. These participants may be very different than the general LGBT \npopulation leading to a possible respondent biased. As studies have shown, when a sexual \nminority individual has peer and family support their mental and physical state is much better. \nThis may have attenuated the relationships between variables assessed in this study (Mereish \n& Poteat, 2015, Szymanski 2006).  \nSince the majority of responses are from participants living in Scandinavia where the \nacceptance for homosexuality is higher then for sexual minorities in for example Asia, \nchances for broad-mindedness towards sexual minorities may be greater and therefore the \nreported wellbeing within the sexual minority group is more likely to have less distress as the \ninstitutional laws have accepted same-sex marriage, a sign on a progressive society. \nAnother option to better understand the dynamics and relationship regarding shame, \nmental and physical health could be to interview participants, especially as the complexity of \nan individual would be able to be examined with subsequent questions.  \nThe correlation between sexual preferences and the Kinsey scale showed and \ninteresting outcome, as the assumption of heterosexual desires and behaviour are rather set in \n 20\t\nstone the results showed a spread of both thoughts and actions, as only 1% declare to never \nthink about same-sex. Although the same-sex attraction might be just a thought, it points \ntowards the direction of what modern society deems as not so usual whereas participants tell \nus that these same-sex thoughts are more than usual, it can even be assumed. As mentioned \nearlier there are also non-heterosexual discrimination within the non-heterosexual \ncommunities, indicating a need for greater acceptance of diversity across all groups (Figueroa \n& Zoccola, 2015; Szymanski, 2006). In her 2011 study of the Kinsey Scale and other types of \nscales, Donna Ducker confirm fluidity as how sexuality is characterized however not a lot of \narticles can be found to highlight not a comparison of behaviour or reasons but more a \nempirical description of todays behaviour in the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual \nsociety.  \nAs Kinsey discovered a lot about human sexual behaviour such as it was not always \nconsistent across time and the findings were revolutionary in the mid 1960th, the contribution \nof a new global and sexual behavioural study may be an awakening to the present day sexual \nnorms and also advocate for acceptance to ones internal thoughts whether you classify \nyourself as heterosexual or non-heterosexual. As reported in this study, possible greater \nacceptance of sexual behaviour in society reduces mental and physical health disparities.  \nMethod discussion. \nThe choice of the Kinsey scale was based on a study in 2011 in which Donna Drucker \ncompared different versions of the Kinsey scales. “HelloQuizzy” was by far the most popular \nquiz in numbers by participants, and all the places on the scale have an equal socio-cultural \nweight and no where on the scale were more “normal” then another in theory. Although not \nall users feel that the present day scale represent the evolving sexual identification, \nparticipants did find that the scale did indeed conceptualize their sexuality, as well as \nparticipants whom felt that their sexuality was fluid across time. In this study modifications \nwere made with the intention to include participants as much as possible, by modifying the \nscale by changing all words from “gender” to “ another” as well as an addition to the scale \nwas put in place on the 23 of November 2015 in question 1, “ I think of myself as” the \nexaminer added the alternative of responding OTHER, with a blank for the participant to fill \nin. \nRestrictions, Limitations and Strengths: \nSeveral limitations were met in this study. In regards to the design of the survey these \nlimitations were encountered. Firstly, the study is limited by its online design. Online \nparticipation has shown to disproportionately represent educated, middle class and white \n 21\t\nparticipation (Galupo, Mitchell, Grynkiewicz, & Davis, 2014). This however counteracted by \nposting and approaching different sexual minority sites all around the world, ranging from \nRFSL students (community sites above the age of 18) in Sweden to the Centre for Black \nEquity an institution for LGBT people of African descent, as well as LGBT sites in Asia. \nDespite these attempts questionnaire was limited as it was in English.  \nSecondly, the purpose of study may have been interpreted non satisfactory to the \nrespondent leading to an early exit, here in the introductory letter to the online questionnaire \ncontact details to the examiner was explicitly listed for further questions with the intention to \nminimalize confusion. Thirdly, as participants may have entered their answers on an iPad or \niPhone, the sensitivity of the screen may have lead to erroneous answers. However, before \nentering the web link, stated directions to be careful when entering the answers counteracted \nthe possibility. Although all the measurement design used in the study were established scales \nwith high validity and reliability, the instructions may have been restrictive in its formulations \nand open for internal interpretation, leading to erroneous answers as the topic is highly \nsensitive and private and delicacy is of high priority. Unfortunately as a result of confusion to \nthe term ethnicity, many respondents wrote their country of residence instead of ethnicity, \nwhich prevented a representative picture. \nIn regards to the limitation of the Kinsey scale, even though the Kinsey scale is \nextensive and ground breaking to acknowledge the different shades of sexual preferences the \nscale has its basis from heterosexuality to homosexuality. As such, it more or less excludes \npansexuality and transsexuality, modifications were made of the scale before published, \nhowever a suggestion for further study would be a renewal of the questions and additional \nconstructions of the scale to incorporate pluri-sexuality and transsexuality with a reformation \nof questions not to be based on bivariate scale.  \nIn regards to the sampling procedure it was also challenging to establish contact with \nminority participants. Firstly as the Facebook community groups were often closed it could \ntake quite some time to receive a response when asked to publish the survey link on the \nproposed site. Further searching for open sexual minority groups and community sites where \nthe link could be posted was often difficult and time consuming. As this study aimed to \nglobalize the health of sexual minority groups the sampling procedure affected the possibility \nto reach global contact, as pages such as Russia, Africa and East Asia hardly or never opened \nthe access for the link to be posted. As a consequence the analysis of countries around the \nworld were not equally distributed and over-representative in Scandinavia, a suggestion for \nfurther research to work with this limitation would be to contact LGBT communities in \n 22\t\nadvance, within a longer timing margin, with a private letter or phone call to ask for access to \ncommunicate directly with the minority groups, which may lead to a more plausible control of \nboth number of participants and actual distribution of countries. \n Secondly, gatekeepers were also encountered and sometimes did not agree for the link \nto be published. This was because these gatekeepers perceived the survey to exclude certain \nmembers, as they found questions to be directed mainly at bivariate sexual groups and \nexclude transgender members. However, the opposite reception was encountered more often \nand the research experienced further sharing of the link by community members and explicit \npraise.  \nThe possibility to research a targeted group through community and minority group is \nvery useful for LGBT research as participants may have a concern regarding privacy and \nwhere participants otherwise may not have been able to participate. Furthermore, given the \nsensitive nature of the questions, regarding sexual preferences, the anonymity may have \nallowed for a greater reporting (Figueroa & Zoccola, 2015).   \nConclusion \nThe intention with this study was to further explore the global generalizability of prior \nfindings regarding poor health and sexual minority groups through the popular social media \nsite Facebook, and also to examine and reflect on sexual preferences instead of sexual \nidentity. No relationship between shame and minority groups could be found. Furthermore the \nlink between poor psychological and poor physical within sexual minority groups was not \nsignificant. This study did however show sexuality as a continuum on the sexual preference \nscale among these groups instead of boxed categories. \nHeterosexuality is a term that needs to be re-examined, plus sexual thoughts, desires \nand actions needs to be brought further into the light as a pathway to understand norms – \nparticularly as we are still in an evolving society. Since over 50% of heterosexuals show to \nhave or have had sexual desire towards the same sex, is heterosexuality really as static a term \nas society has taken it for? A suggestion for further research would be to further examine the \nterm heterosexuality, by investigating the thoughts, behaviour and desires of individuals. This \nwill help to elucidate “modern” sexuality, as well as to prevent cognitive dissonance in youth \nwith regards to sexual labels. \n \n \n \n \t\n 23\t\n\t\t\nReferences\t\n\t\nAnnual report of the American Psychological Association.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the empirical generalizability of the relationship between sexual minorities Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual (LGBT), shame and mental and physical health. It was an extension of existing studies and inspired by the framework of Mereish and Poteat’s study in 2015, “A Relational Model of Sexual Minority Mental and Physical Health”. First hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between individuals with non-heterosexual sexual preference and shame. The second hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between psychological and physical poor health within the minority groups. Sexual preferences were examined as the third hypothesis, exploring the compatibility between self-identified sexual preferences and assigned sexuality using the Kinsey scale. 144 Participants aged from 18 to 70 years, participated in an online survey design where they were asked 87 questions. While this study could not confirm the two first hypotheses, a positive correlation between mental distress and physical symptoms, and a significant correlation between the self-identified and the sexual preferences identified by the Kinsey Scale were found. Implications of these findings were discussed with reference to the complexity of measuring sexual minorities groups, the influence of written instructions, choice of instruments and suggestions are made for future research.I denna studie undersöktes de sexuella minoritetsgrupperna, Lesbiska, Homosexuella, Bisexuella, Transsexuella (LGBT), relation med mental och fysiska ohälsa. Studien var inspirerad av Mereish och Poteat’s forskning i 2015, “A Relational Model of Sexual Minority Mental and Physical Health”, och fokuserade på förhållandet mellan skam, psykologisk och fysisk ohälsa. Inom studien undersöktes även sexuella preferenser med användning av Kinsey-skalan för att titta närmare på beteende i samband med identifierad sexualitet. Den första hypotesen var att det skulle finnas en relation mellan icke-heterosexuella sexuella preferenser och skam, den andra hypotesen var att det skulle finnas en positiv relation mellan psykologisk och fysiologisk ohälsa inom de sexuella minoritetsgrupperna. Den tredje hypotesen antog en korrelation mellan Kinsey skalan och sexuella preferenser. Dessa hypoteser testades via en nät enkät. 144 deltagare mellan 18 och 70 års ålder deltog och svarade på 87 frågor. Denna undersökning kunde inte bekräfta de två hypoteserna. Dock fanns ett sammanband mellan psykologiska symptom och fysiska symptom och en positiv korrelation mellan själv-identifierad sexualitet och identifierad sexualitet av Kinsey-skalan. Slutsatser och svårigheter diskuteras med reflektion över mätinstrument, och komplexitet av att mäta sexuella minoritetsgrupper gällande olika faktorer. Även förslag till framtida studier och fokus över vikten av potentiella faktorer och effekter såsom instruktioner och val av instrument",
