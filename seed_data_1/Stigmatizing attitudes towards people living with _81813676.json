The lack of\na valid and reliable measurement tool for stigmatization is a major gap in the research. This study aimed to:\n1) develop a scale of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV (SAT-PLWHA-S) and 2) demonstrate its\nreliability and validity.\nMethods: French and English-speaking experts (n = 21) from different professional communities (academics,\npractitioners) assessed the clarity and relevance of the proposed items. The psychometric properties of the\nSAT-PLWHA-S were assessed with a random digit dial population based telephone survey (n = 1,500) of respondents\nin Quebec, Canada. Analyses included exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, correlations, multiple linear\nregressions, t-tests, hypothesis testing of factorial structure invariance, and Cronbach’s alpha.\nResults: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a 27-item structure with seven factors: 1) concerns about\noccasional encounters; 2) avoidance of personal contact; 3) responsibility and blame, 4) liberalism, 5) non-discrimination,\n6) confidentiality of seropositive status, and 7) criminalization of HIV transmission. Cronbach’s alphas indicate satisfactory\ninternal consistency. An assessment of concurrent validity using Pearson’s correlation and multiple linear regression\nshows that homophobia and HIV transmission knowledge are significant determinants of stigmatizing attitudes toward\nPLHIV. Discriminant validity (t-test) results suggest that the SAT-PLWHA-S can differentiate attitudes between different\ngroups and indicates invariant factor structure across language.\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that the SAT-PLWHA-S is a reliable and valid tool for measuring\nstigmatizing attitudes toward PLHIV and that it can contribute to a deeper understanding of HIV stigma.\nKeywords: Attitudes, Stigma, HIV/AIDS, Scale, ValidationBackground\nSince the first cases were identified in the early 1980s\nHIV/AIDS has become epidemic. In Canada, there were\nan estimated 71,300 people living in 2011 with HIV/\nAIDS (PLWHA), one-quarter of whom did not know of\ntheir serological status [1]. HIV/AIDS stigmatization\nposes a major challenge to preventive public health ef-\nforts by contributing to underreporting of cases [2-5].\nEarly detection is therefore key to preventing the spread\nof HIV [6] because it encourages individuals to adopt\nsafer practices [7-16] and results in more effective and* Correspondence: beaulieu.marianne@gmail.com\n1Département de médecine sociale et préventive, Université de Montréal,\nMontréal, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2014 Beaulieu et al.; licensee BioMed Centra\nCommons Attribution License (http://creativec\nreproduction in any medium, provided the or\nDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.or\nunless otherwise stated.efficient medical care by reducing the infectivity of indi-\nviduals with HIV [17-21], and therefore the risk of\nspreading the virus [22-24]. Even when they are aware of\nthe risks of infection, many people avoid taking a screen-\ning test for fear that the result will be positive and they\nwill have to cope with the stigma that accompanies the\ndisease [2,3,25-31]. Therefore, among the harmful conse-\nquences of this stigma is that it contributes to the spread\nof the disease [26,32].\nStigma is defined as “an attribute that is deeply discre-\nditing” [33]. Stigmatization is also defined as an inter-\ntwined mix of perspective (perceiver vs. target), identity\n(group-based vs. personal) and cognitive-affective-behavioral\nresponse [34].

The cognitive dimension\n(e.g. stereotypes) is the most frequently studied dimen-\nsion [40,42-45,47,48]. These generally capture moral\njudgment (e.g. PLWHA should be blamed, punished,\ncondemned or held responsible for being HIV-positive)\nor the expression of negative beliefs towards groups dis-\nproportionately affected by the epidemic (e.g. being dirty\nor cursed) [3,44,49-52]. The second most documented\ndimension is the behavioral one (e.g. discrimination)\n[40,42,44,46-48]. It is operationalized as treatment from\nsociety, such as whether PLWHA should be supported\nor discriminated against and whether their behaviour\nshould be circumscribed. There are two other dimen-\nsions, interpersonal distancing (e.g. minimizing contact\nwith PLWHA) and use of coercive measures (e.g. confi-\ndentiality of serological status, position on HIV/AIDS\ncriminalization) [53]. The affective dimension is rarely\nmeasured [40-42,44,47,48]. It relates to feeling favourably\ntowards infected persons or respondents’ comfort in inter-\nacting with PLWHA in different settings. Many authors\nhave stressed that HIV/AIDS prejudice can largely be ex-\nplained by the fears, sometimes irrational, that surround\nthe disease: fear of catching it, its incurable nature, and its\npotentially lethal consequences [5,44,49-51,54].\nOne obstacle to understanding the impact of HIV/\nAIDS stigmatization on the spread of the disease in\nNorth America is the scarcity of empirical research in\nthis area [55]. In addition, studies that have attempted to\ndescribe and measure HIV/AIDS stigmatization contain\ncertain methodological shortcomings, are generally athe-\noretical, and fail to cover all its conceptual dimensions\n[35,56-58]. There are few published questionnaires in the\nliterature that measure different dimensions of PLWHA\nstigmatization [40-47,59]. Dimensions most frequently\ndocumented are PLWHA blame, legislative procedures or\nmonitoring of PLWHA and PLWHA rights. Other dimen-\nsions of stigma are rarely measured: comfort level with\nPLWHA, prejudices against PLWHA, feelings towards\nPLHIV and social support. Most of the HIV stigma mea-\nsures address prejudices and discrimination, but few have\ndocumented the stereotypes. Moreover, measures need to\nbe adapted to account for new realities concerning the dis-\nease, particularly since the introduction of antiretroviral\ntreatments (ARV). Consequently, some measures have be-\ncome outdated and no longer reflect current concerns.\nFor example, in recent years, to measure support for co-\nercive measures, statements addressing the quarantine of\nPLWHA [60,61] rather than mandatory disclosure ofseropositive status [62] or the criminalization of PLWHA\nhave become more widely used [63].\nAlthough existing questionnaires have all been pub-\nlished, a small number of measures have been examined\nfor validity and reliability [35]. Few studies have used\nexpert consultation [64] to determine the relationship be-\ntween stigmatization measures and the concepts consid-\nered to ensure content validity [53]. Researchers have\nrarely used advanced methodologies such as confirmatory\nfactor analysis to provide a deeper understanding of the\nconstructs derived from measuring instruments. Among\nthe questionnaires published in the literature, only three\nhave been the subject of rigorous validation analysis\n[40,45,59]. The scale of Kalichman and colleagues’ scale\n[45] was developed to measure PLWHA stigmatization in\nSouth Africa, while the Bresnahan & Zhuang’s scale [59]\ndoes not cover all the stigma dimensions. Adrien and col-\nleagues [40] developed their instrument in 1996 and used\nit in Canada (more specifically, in the province of Quebec).\nFor that reason, Adrien et al. [40] instrument was chosen\nto serve as a basis for the development of a new measure-\nment scale.\nContext\nIn spring 2009, the Ministry of Health and Human Ser-\nvices funded the Public Health Department of Montreal\nto conduct a survey to document the evolution of atti-\ntudes towards PLWHA in Quebec. This survey was the\nthird to be conducted in Quebec [40]. The first, con-\nducted in 1996, sought to assess attitudes and risk be-\nhaviors associated with HIV in the general population,\nwith a 16 items scale in a sample of 3501 people (5 fac-\ntors: fear of being infected, fear of contact with PLWHA,\nprejudicial beliefs toward groups at high risk of HIV, tol-\nerance regarding sexual mores and behaviors, social sup-\nport for PLWHA). In spring 2002, the same study was\nrepeated to measure changes that may occurred since\n1996 in attitudes towards PLWHA. The second study in-\ncluded the scale validated in 1996 (16 items – 5 factors),\nwhile adding new statements that take into account the\nemergence of new attitudes within the population of\nQuebec on the evolution of the epidemic or new mea-\nsures to control epidemic.\nThe aim of this study is to validate the modified ver-\nsion of a scale designed to measure stigmatizing atti-\ntudes toward PLWHA (SSAT- PLWHA) adapted to the\nnew reality of HIV/AIDS in the general population of\nQuebec, Canada.\nMethods\nDevelopment of the SAT-PLWHA-S\nThe SAT-PLWHA-S was developed in four phases: plan-\nning, construction, testing, and validation [65]. The study\nprotocol was approved by the Review Boards of the\nBeaulieu et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:1246 Page 3 of 13\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/1246Faculty of Medicine of Université de Montréal and of the\nMontreal Public Health governmental authority.\nIn the planning phase, a steering committee was\nformed of various stakeholders from clinical, commu-\nnity, decision-making, and university circles concerned\nwith the issue of HIV/AIDS stigma in Quebec. Some of\nthe committee members were living with HIV. Its man-\ndate was to deepen the understanding of current dimen-\nsions of HIV/AIDS stigma. Structured literature searches\nwere conducted on various search engines (e.g., PubMed,\nSociofile, Google Scholar) which enabled defining di-\nmensions of stigma both conceptually sound and rele-\nvant to practice: responsibility and blame, confidentiality\nof serological status, HIV criminalization, PLWHA coer-\ncion, PLWHA rights, negative feelings towards PLWHA\n[35-38,41-48,53]. The following dimensions were added\nto the existing ones: fear of being infected, fear of con-\ntact with PLWHA, prejudicial beliefs toward groups at\nhigh risk of HIV, tolerance regarding sexual mores and\nbehaviors, and social support for PLWHA [40].\nIn the construction phase a pool of items was devel-\noped for each dimension of stigma identified in the plan-\nning phase, items were formulated by the lead author. A\ngroup of Canadian experts (n = 21) was selected accord-\ning to language spoken (French (n = 13); English (n = 8))\nand type of expertise (academics specialized in HIV (n = 9);\nfront line workers, health professionals or public health\ndecision makers (n = 12)). Some of the experts consulted\nwere openly living with HIV. The experts’ mandate was to\nassess the clarity and relevance of the proposed items to\nensure the scale’s content validity. Each item was assessed\nin relation to a conceptual definition on a seven-point\nLikert scale from 1 (not relevant/not clear) to 7 (relevant/\nclear). The experts were also asked to comment on the\nitems and suggest missing questions or dimensions. The\nresponses and comments were reviewed and considered\nby the research team. No cut-off point was predetermined;\nthe items were compared among themselves on the basis\nof expert assessment. Items that earned higher scores for\nrelevance and clarity from all expert subgroups (language\nand type of expertise) were retained in the first version of\nthe questionnaire.\nTo ensure item clarity, the questionnaire was tested in\na convenience sample of 24 respondents using the same\nmethod as for the data collection - telephone interviews.\nInclusion criteria were age from 15 to 65 years and the\nability to speak French. After completing the question-\nnaire, respondents were asked to comment on the ex-\nperience and, if appropriate, to explain during a brief\nsemi-structured interview any difficulties they had.\nThe questionnaire was then administered by a survey\nfirm to 200 respondents (100 French-speaking and 100\nEnglish-speaking) as a pretest. The aim was to assess the\naverage duration of the interviews, comprehension ofthe questions, the logical structure of the questionnaire,\nand how to program skipped questions and sections.\nBased on the pretest the questionnaire was again slightly\nmodified.\nThe polling firm Léger Marketing collected data for\nthe final survey from March 15 to April 2, 2010. Inter-\nviews were conducted by experienced interviewers,\nbased on instructions provided by the research team.\nFor the telephone interviews a stratified sample was\nused, consisting of 1,500 individuals living in all regions\nof Quebec aged from 15 to 64 years and able to speak\nFrench or English. Non-proportional quota sampling\nwas therefore used to build the samples of French and\nEnglish-speaking participants (French-speaking N = 1,040;\nEnglish-speaking N = 460). Participants’ telephone num-\nbers were randomly selected using ASDE Survey Sampler.\nAll participants provided oral consent. Respondents were\nrandomly selected within households according to whose\nbirthday came next. The targeted response rate was 73.0%\nand the obtained response rate was 73.5%.\nMeasures\nScale of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV\nThe final version of the questionnaire on stigmatizing at-\ntitudes towards PLWHA contained 42 items (Table 1)\ncovering eight dimensions based on the literature review:\nconcerns about occasional encounters (5 items), avoid-\nance of personal contact (3 items), responsibility and\nblame (6 items), liberalism (4 items), non-discrimination\n(7 items), confidentiality of serological status (6 items),\nposition on HIV/AIDS criminalization (6 items), and\nnegative feelings (5 items). The Likert response scale for\neach statement ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4\n(strongly agree). Once validated, some items will be re-\nverse coded such that a higher mean score indicates a\nmore positive overall attitude (continuous score ranging\nfrom 1 to 4).\nMeasure of homophobia\nThe short version of the Attitudes Toward Gay Men\nscale [66] contained five items. The Likert response scale\nranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\nThe short scale showed strong correlations with the ori-\nginal scale (r = 0.96) and satisfactory reliability (α = 0.87)\nin a validation study using a telephone survey [66]. Scores\non the homophobia scale were obtained by averaging the\nfive item scores (ex. “I think male homosexuals are dis-\ngusting”, “Homosexual behavior between two men is just\nplain wrong”), higher score indicates more homophobia.\nMeasure of HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge\nA seven-item scale addressing transmission knowledge\nwas also administered to respondents [40]. For each item\nrespondents were asked to assess the risk of HIV/AIDS\nTable 1 Complete questionnaire (42 items)\nItem labelling\nPrejudices (affects) 1.Being around someone who has AIDS does not bother me.\n2.I would not be worried for my health if a co-worker had AIDS.\n3.It would not bother me if there was a boarding house for people with AIDS on my street.\n21.I would quit my job before I would work with a person who is infected by the AIDS virus.\n23.If I had a roommate and discovered he was infected with the AIDS virus, it would not bother me.\nPrejudices (affects) 4.− I could not be friends with someone who has AIDS.\n5.− I would limit my contact with a person whom I know is infected with AIDS.\n6.− I would not hug someone with AIDS.\nStereotyping (cognitions) 7.− People who use injectable drugs deserve to have AIDS.\n8.− My support for a person living with AIDS depends on how the person was infected.\n9.− I am disgusted by persons who were infected during homosexual relations.\n17.− People who are infected with the AIDS virus because they have not used a condom deserve\nwhat they get.\n29.− People with AIDS have only themselves to blame.\n39.− Most people with AIDS are responsible for having their illness.\nValues 10.−To fight AIDS, it is necessary that young people not have sex.\n11.−Reinforcement of traditional sexual values will help to control AIDS.\n12.−The arrival of AIDS is linked to the fact that people have more sexual freedom.\n13.−The spread of AIDS is linked to the decline of moral values.\nDiscrimination (actions) 14.People who have AIDS should have the right to work serving the public, as waiters-waitresses,\ncooks, hairdressers.\n15.Children who are infected with the aids virus should be able to go to day-care.\n16.Doctors with AIDS should be allowed to go on working with their patients.\n19.People infected with the aids virus should be allowed to immigrate to Canada.\n24.Women who know they are infected with the AIDS virus have the right to have children.\n28.People who are infected with the AIDS virus have the right to have a love life.\n35.People with AIDS have the right to be sexually active.\nDiscrimination (actions) 18.A doctor should have the right to warn the sexual partners of a person who has the AIDS virus if that\nperson refuses to do so.\n22.If my partner has the AIDS virus, I should be warned, even without his or her permission.\n27.− I have the right to know if someone around me is infected with the AIDS virus.\n32.When a screening test indicates that someone is infected with the AIDS virus, the result should\nremain confidential.\n38.People infected with the AIDS virus should inform their sexual partners.\n41.− Doctors should report the names of people with AIDS to the government.\nDiscrimination (actions) 20.It is criminal for a person who knows that he or she is infected with the AIDS virus not to use a condom.\n26.− Transmitting the AIDS virus should be punishable by law.\n31.− People who know they are infected with the AIDS virus and who transmit the virus are criminals.\n34.− Transmitting the AIDS virus is a crime.\n37.People who know they are infected with the AIDS virus and share their needles with other people should be\npunished under the law.\n40.Transmitting the AIDS virus is a crime only if done so intentionally.\nPrejudices (affects) 25.I am disgusted by people who have the AIDS virus.\n30.I feel compassion for people infected with the AIDS virus.\nBeaulieu et al.

Results on\nHIV/AIDS transmission knowledge were weighted (to\nreflect a priori experts’ criteria) by coding very high\nknowledge as 4, relatively high and relatively low partial\nknowledge as 3 and 2, respectively, and absence of\nknowledge as 1. The score on this scale was obtained by\naveraging the scores on the seven items (ex. risk of being\ninfected when… “Sharing a glass with a person infected\nwith the AIDS virus”, “Shaking hands with a person in-\nfected with the AIDS virus”), higher score indicates\nhigher knowledge.\nSociodemographic measures\nThe sociodemographic variables considered included\nsex, language spoken at home (French or English), age,\ncountry of birth (Canada or other), number of years of\neducation, and being acquainted with a PLWHA.\nAnalysis\nIn order to validate the SAT-PLWHA-S in the general\nQuebec population, the data were used for construct,\ndiscriminant, and criterion-related validity as well as re-\nliability studies. Construct validity was examined in two\nsteps using factor analyses of the survey data. First, the\nsample was randomly divided into two subsamples. Prin-\ncipal component analyses (PCA) and exploratory factor\nanalyses (EFA) using principal axis factoring (PAF) with\nOBLIMIN (oblique) rotation were performed on the first\nsubsample to identify the most valid factors among the\n42 scale items. EFA were conducted by successively intro-\nducing items by conceptual blocks based on theoretical\ngroupings. Groupings with low factor loadings (<0.30)\nwere excluded one by one. Confirmatory factor analyses\nwere then conducted on the second subsample [67].\nConfirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were run by apply-\ning the weighted least squares (WLS) estimator to the\npolychoric correlation matrix, an appropriate method for\nordinal data [68]. The Chi-squared test is initially used\nto estimate model fit. Because this test is sensitive to\nsample size [69], fit is also assessed with other indices.\nThe Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Non-Normed\nFit Index (NNFI) compare model fit to that of an inde-\npendent (nul) model, with a value greater than 0.95 indi-\ncating good fit [70]. The Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI)\nmeasures the relative amount of variance and covariancepredicted by the model, with a value greater than 0.95\nindicating good fit [71]. The Root Mean Square Error of\nApproximation (RMSEA) is a measure of approximate\nfit in the population, with a value less than 0.06 indicat-\ning good fit [70]. The Standardized Root Mean Square\nResidual (SRMR) is based on the fitted residuals, and a\nvalue of less than 0.09 indicates good fit [70]. Analyses\nwere conducted using LISREL (8.80). Once a satisfactory\nmodel presenting a factorial complexity of one was ob-\ntained, factor scores were computed for each factor by\naveraging their items. A total score was also computed\nby averaging all items retained in the scale.\nTo ensure that the SAT-PLWHA-S can differentiate\ngroups of respondents, discriminant validity was assessed\n(using t tests with SAT-PLWHA-S mean score) by com-\nparing upper and lower quartile groups for the continuous\nvariables (age, education, knowledge score, homophobia\nscore) and for language and sex.\nSpecific structure invariance hypotheses were tested\nfor both linguistic groups, Anglophones (a) and Franco-\nphones (f ) [68]. Four hypotheses were successively tested\nwith additional constraints added at each step. The first\nhypothesis (B) tested the invariance of the factor pattern,\nwhich includes the number of factors, for the two com-\npared groups (here, factor loadings values could differ).\nThe second hypothesis (C) tested the invariance of factor\nloadings (Λx\n(f ) =Λx\n(a)) assuming (B). The third hypoth-\nesis (D) tested the invariance of the covariance matrix\nfor errors of measurement (Θδ\n(f ) =Θδ\n(a)) assuming (C).\nThe fourth hypothesis (E) tested the simultaneous in-\nvariance of factor patterns, loadings, covariance, and\nvariance among errors of measurement and among fac-\ntors (Φ(f ) =Φ(a)). The hypothesis testing was conducted\nusing robust maximum-likelihood (RML) estimation be-\ncause underlying approximate normality did not hold for\nsome polychoric correlations (4% of RMSEA tests of\nclose fit implied a rejection of underlying approximate\nbivariate normality at 5% level of significance). The ana-\nlyses produced Chi-square goodness of fit test which\nwere complemented by fit indices CFI, NNFI, GFI,\nRMSEA, and SRMR, including PNFI, a parsimony\nnormed fit index that adjusts downward for more com-\nplex models (with fewer degrees of freedom). These\nmodels with increasing constraints were successively tested\nfor improvement of the fit. Analyses were performed with\nLISREL (8.80).\nBeaulieu et al. BMC Public Health 2014, 14:1246 Page 6 of 13\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/1246Criterion-related validity was assessed with Pearson’s\ncorrelations between factor and total scores on stigma-\ntizing attitudes towards PLWHA and for homophobia\nscores for the total sample and the French and English\nsubsamples. Sequential multiple regression on the stig-\nmatizing attitudes towards PLWHA total scores was per-\nformed by introducing independent variables into the\nregression model in three successive blocks: 1) homo-\nphobia, 2) HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge, and 3)\nsociodemographic characteristics.\nTo assess the internal consistency of the total and fac-\ntor scores identified in the factor analyses, Cronbach’s al-\nphas were calculated using SPSS (17.0). Values greater\nthan 0.70 indicate satisfactory internal consistency [72].Results\nParticipants’ characteristics\nThe analyses presented in this study were performed on\nthe responses of 1,370 participants. Respondents for\nwhom data were missing on the SAT-PLWHA-S were\nexcluded from the analyses (n = 130). Once weighted,\nthe total sample size was 1,387 participants. The post-\nstratification weight scheme adjusted for sex, age, region,\nand language. Average age of respondents was 41.5 years\n(SD 13.7 years), and 49.7% were women. Most respon-\ndents were relatively educated, with an average of 14.2\nyears of education (SD 3.4 years). 80.3% of the sample\nspoke French, reflecting the oversampling among Anglo-\nphones, and 89.2% were born in Canada. A quarter of\nthe sample (26.0%) knew a PLWHA.Exploratory factor analysis\nThe EFA performed on the SAT-PLWHA-S scores pro-\nduced a 27-item (from an initial pool of 42 items) solu-\ntion grouped into seven factors (see Additional file 1).\nConcerns about occasional encounters (F1, 3i) measures\nthe discomfort related to occasional interaction. Avoid-\nance of personal contact (F2, 3i) refers to discomfort of\nphysical proximity to a PLWHA. Responsibility and\nblame (F3, 6i) are stereotypical negative beliefs about\nPLWHA, in general, and also about the behaviors of\ngroups that are at greater risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS.\nLiberalism (F4, 4i) captures perceived associations be-\ntween HIV/AIDS and sexual values, operationalized\nthrough morality and sexual norms. Non-discrimination\n(F5, 5i) reflects the desire to integrate PLWHA into di-\nverse areas of social and professional life, whereas confi-\ndentiality of serological status (F6, 3i) and criminalization\nof HIV transmission (F7, 3i) measure support for coercive\nmeasures. Fifteen items with low communalities or factor\nloadings (<0.30) were excluded. One communality was\nhigh (0.70), 24 were moderate (from 0.68 to 0.31), and\ntwo were marginally low (0.28). The majority of factorloadings were high (from 0.71 to 0.82) or moderate (from\n0.65 to 0.34).\nThe seven factors had a factorial complexity of 1, indi-\ncating a simple structure. The high Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin\nindex (KMO = 0.91) and the significant Bartlett’s test of\nsphericity (p < 0.001) indicated that the correlation matrix\nwas adequate for EFA. The seven-factor PAF solution ex-\nplained 43.5% of the total variance and accounted for\n75.5% of the variance when the data were reduced to\nseven dimensions using PCA. Estimated correlations be-\ntween the factors were moderate (from 0.56 to 0.33) to\nlow (from 0.29 to 0.17).\nConfirmatory factor analysis\nThe model with seven correlated factors, determined\nthrough EFA on the first subsample, was confirmed in\nthe second subsample (n = 689). Results of the CFA on\nthe second subsample are presented in Tables 2 and 3.\nFor the WLS estimation the χ2 test of fit was significant,\n(χ2 = 1083.59, df = 303, p < 0.001). According to estab-\nlished procedure, model fit was then assessed with vari-\nous fit indices [73], revealing good fit (CFI = 0.953;\nNNFI = 0.945; GFI = 0.969; RMSEA = 0.0612; SRMR =\n0.164). As an alternative to WLS, all analyses were rerun\nusing robust RML estimation to correct for lack of nor-\nmality. These results also indicated good model fit, with\nSRMR below the 0.09 threshold (see Table 4).\nFactor structure invariance\nTable 5 presents the four hypothesis tests (B, C, D, and\nE) for equality of factor structures in French and English\nspeakers. The analysis of fit indices and chi-square\nchange (and its level of significance) indicate good fit\nand confirm that the scale has the same factor pattern\n(Hypothesis B), factor loadings (Hypothesis C), variances\nand covariances of errors of measurement (Hypothesis\nD), and factor variances and covariances (Hypothesis E)\nfor French and English speakers. As changes in chi-\nsquare results are sensitive to sample size, when the\nsample is large, it is necessary to take into account other\ncriteria such as the change in RMSEA or the change in\nCFI [74]. As indicated by our results, although the\nchange in chi-square is significant, the lack of change in\nRMSEA or CFI leads to the conclusion that the model is\ninvariant. Hence, the factor structure is the same for the\ntwo language groups, indicating the scale and factors are\nnot sensitive to language (French or English).\nReliability: internal consistency\nThe reliability of all factors was high to moderate: concerns\nabout occasional encounters (0.74), avoidance of personal\ncontact (0.79), responsibility and blame (0.77), liberalism\n(0.69), non-discrimination (0.77), criminalization of trans-\nmission (0.69), and confidentiality of serological status\nTable 2 Confirmatory factor analysis of the SAT-PLWHA-S: final solution, completely standardized for 7 oblique factors\nItem\nno.\nRegression coefficients* Error\nvarianceItem description F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7\nF1: Concerns about occasional encounters\n1 Being around someone who has AIDS does not bother me. .983 .034\n2 I would not be worried for my health if a co-worker had AIDS. .935 .126\n3 It would not bother me if there was a boarding house for people with AIDS\non my street.\n.796 .366\nF2: Avoidance of personal contact\n4 I could not be friends with someone who has AIDS. .908 .176\n5 I would limit my contact with a person whom I know is infected with AIDS. .888 .212\n6 I would not hug someone with AIDS. .968 .064\nF3: Responsibility and blame\n7 People who use injectable drugs deserve to have AIDS. .802 .357\n8 My support for a person living with AIDS depends on how the person\nwas infected.\n.822 .325\n9 I am disgusted by persons who were infected during homosexual relations. .956 .086\n17 People who are infected with the AIDS virus because they have not used a\ncondom deserve what they get.\n.872 .240\n29 People with AIDS have only themselves to blame. .799 .362\n39 Most people with AIDS are responsible for having their illness. .721 .481\nF4: Liberalism\n10 To fight AIDS, it is necessary that young people not have sex. .783 .387\n11 Reinforcement of traditional sexual values will help to control AIDS. .762 .419\n12 The arrival of AIDS is linked to the fact that people have more sexual freedom. .789 .378\n13 The spread of AIDS is linked to the decline of moral values. .787 .380\nF5: Non-discrimination\n14 People who have AIDS should have the right to work serving the public,\nas waiters-waitresses, cooks, hairdressers, etc.\n.901 .189\n15 Children who are infected with the aids virus should be able to go to day-care. .857 .266\n16 Doctors with AIDS should be allowed to go on working with their patients. .674 .546\n19 People infected with the aids virus should be allowed to immigrate to Canada. .724 .475\n23 If I had a roommate and discovered he was infected with the AIDS virus,\nit would not bother me.\n.821 .326\nF6: Confidentiality of serological status\n27 I have the right to know if someone around me is infected with the AIDS virus. .766 .413\n32 When a screening test indicates that someone is infected with the AIDS virus,\nthe result should remain confidential.\n.638 .592\n41 Doctors should report the names of people with AIDS to the government. .665 .558\nF7: Criminalization of transmission\n26 Transmitting the AIDS virus should be punishable by law. .686 .529\n31 People who know they are infected with the AIDS virus and who transmit the\nvirus are criminals.\n.692 .521\n34 Transmitting the AIDS virus is a crime. .960 .079\nNote. n = 689. *All regression coefficients and error variances are significant at 0.05.\nBeaulieu et al.

The individuals with\nmore stigmatizing attitudes towards PLWHA were men,\nolder, born outside Canada, less educated, and more\nhomophobic. They also did not know any PLWHA and\nhad less HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. However, it\nis important to note the large effect (Cohen’s d) size for\n“HIV knowledge” and “homophobia”.\nStratified analysis by factor showed a similar trend to\nthe total factor scores, with some minor differences.\nWith the exception of Criminalization of HIV transmis-\nsion -F7, no significant differences were found between\nEnglish and French-speaking participants. However,\nwhereas more English speakers were in favour of crimi-\nnalization (F7), there were no differences for sex, educa-\ntion, or acquaintance with PLWHA. In addition, there\nwas no difference by country of birth on avoidance of\npersonal contact (F2) or non-discrimination (F5). Simi-\nlarly, there was no age difference in terms of responsibil-\nity and blame (F3), and no sex difference on liberalism\n(F4). In addition, no significant difference was found for\nsex, age, or country of birth for scores on confidentiality\nof seropositive status (F6).\nCriterion-related and concomitant validity\nTable 7 presents the correlations between stigmatizing\nattitudes towards PLWHA and male homophobia. Re-\nsults show that the SAT-PLWHA-S correlates moder-\nately negatively with the homophobia scale (-0.59), with\neach factor correlating negatively (from -0.50 to -0.35)\nwith the homophobia scale.

Results\nindicate that the total score on stigmatizing attitudes to-\nwards PLWHA is largely explained by homophobia and\nHIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. These two variables\nalone account for 42.2% of the variance of the total score\non stigmatizing attitudes, whereas the addition of the\nsociodemographic variables explains only an additional\n1.1%.

The stronger the values\nagainst PLWHA, the greater the social distancing, the\nsupport for coercive measures, and the potential for\nstigma. These conceptual dimensions are clearly and dis-\ntinctly expressed in the scale, and present a confirmed\nstructure.\nConceptually concerns about occasional encounters (F1)\nand avoidance of personal contact (F2), these two attitudes\ncome under the umbrella of prejudices, whereby people\nerroneously fear interacting with PLWHA in diverse situa-\ntions [75]. In agreement with the most recently published\ndata, the rather high factor scores on these two factors\nshow that Quebec’s population does not appear to hold\nunfavourable attitudes towards contact with PLWHA [42].\nSimilar to the present study’s examination of responsi-\nbility and blame (F3), many researchers have shown that\npeople tend to blame PLWHA for their condition more\nthan they seek to avoid them [3,42,48,76].\nNon-discrimination (F5) appears to be a very important\naspect of stigma, with potentially negative consequences\nfor PLWHA [27]. Given that this factor constitutes a dis-\ntinct component of the scale, it may be concluded that at-\ntitudes that favour discrimination should be included in a\ncomplete conceptualization of stigmatizing attitudes, as\nsuggested by Pescosolido et al. [77].\nThe last two factors operationalize the most severe form\nof discrimination, e.g. support for coercive measures [53].\n“Confidentiality of serological status” - F6 includes three\nitems that measure support for the confidentiality of HIV/Table 8 Sequential regression on total scores for stigmatizing\nBLOCKS Variables B\nBLOCK 1 Homophobia -.239\nBLOCK 2 Knowledge .307\nBLOCK 3 Sociodemographic\nSex -.019\nLanguage: French -.017\nAge -.002\nCountry of birth: Canada -.006\nEducation .008\nAcquaintance with PLWHA .092\nNote. n = 1387. ***p < 0.001.AIDS, and “Criminalization of HIV transmission” - F7 (3\nitems) measures criminalization of HIV/AIDS transmis-\nsion. Identifying specific, meaningful concepts and defin-\ning corresponding subscales that reflect current situations\nimproves the scale validity over scales that address out-\ndated coercive measures, such as quarantine, refusal of ad-\nmittance to countries, public identification of PLWHA\nand mandatory screening tests [61,78,79]. Hence, it is\nmore sensitive to new, more subtle forms of stigmatization\n[50]. The scores obtained on these two factors suggest that\nthe attitudes of Quebec’s population concerning coercion\nare moderate, concurring with studies in the United States\nby Herek and colleagues [61]. It may be appropriate to con-\nsider the tendency to support coercive measures against\nPLWHA in the study of HIV/AIDS stigmatization and\nwhether this new form of stigma occurs cross-culturally.\nThis new scale may be useful in several ways. First, it\ncould be used as a surveillance tool to monitor HIV/\nAIDS stigmatizing attitudes at the population level, but\nalso to assess the effectiveness of awareness campaigns.\nSecond, the scale could be used in other industrialized\ncountries similar to Quebec (United States, England,\nAustralia, France) since structural invariance between\nthe English and French versions has been demonstrated.\nThe use of the scale in other contexts could help to ac-\ncurately compare different populations. Third, used in\ncombination with other behavioral measures (e.g. HIV/\nAIDS testing), the scale could lead to a better under-\nstanding of the impact of stigma on health behaviors.\nThe development of this scale also has potential implica-\ntions for future research.

Future research may ex-\nplore the influence of those new dimensions and deter-\nmine if they are more harmful for PLWHA.\nAlthough the results demonstrate that the SAT-PLWHA-S\nis a valid instrument for measuring stigmatizing attitudes\ntowards PLWHA, this study contains certain limitations.\nFirst, as is often the case with telephone surveys, the sam-\nple may not be representative of the population because it\nexcluded people who do not have a residential landline\nphone [80]. Unfortunately, the non-respondent profile was\nnot documented, it is thus hard to estimate the extent to\nwhich non-response could have biased the results. Second,\nit is also possible that the results were biased by a degree\nof social desirability due to the socially sensitive topic.\nSome respondents may have modified their responses to-\nwards less stigma than they actually felt [81]. Furthermore,\nthis study considers stigma from a sociocognitive perspec-\ntive, which does not allow a complete accounting of the\ncomplex issues involved. To thoroughly examine this sub-\nject in all its complexity, the SAT-PLWHA-S should be\nused in combination with other structural data and mea-\nsures, such as discourse analyses of laws, public policy,\nand the media. Although this study established some im-\nportant psychometric properties of the SAT-PLWHA-S,\nstigma changes over time, as the perception of HIV/\nAIDS itself evolves. Therefore, this scale would require\nperiodic review to update the content and revalidate re-\nvised versions.\nAlthough the need has been stressed to relate measures\nof HIV/AIDS stigma to measures of associated concepts,\nfew studies have assessed criterion-related validity in this\nmanner [53]. An innovative aspect of the present study is\nthe assessment of concomitant validity through associa-\ntions between stigmatizing attitudes, homophobia, and\nHIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. The association be-\ntween stigmatizing attitudes and homophobia could also\nindicate that PLWHA are subject to numerous forms of\nstigmatization [32,82]. In addition, the discriminant valid-\nity analysis shows that the SAT-PLWHA-S can also dis-\ncriminate between the responses of different subgroups.\nThus, individuals who have more stigmatizing attitudes to-\nwards PLWHA are more homophobic, have less HIV/\nAIDS transmission knowledge, are not acquainted with\nPLWHA, have less education, and are older. Further-\nmore, the results show no differences between French\nand English speakers.\nConclusion\nDeveloped in collaboration with a steering committee\ninvolving a number of key stakeholders in the field, the\nSAT-PLWHA-S reflects current concerns surrounding\nHIV/AIDS. It enables bridging the gap between emer-\nging practical issues and conceptual considerations. Inthis sense, it contributes to a deeper understanding of\nthe complex concept of stigma. The SAT-PLWHA-S\nshould enable a better appreciation of how PLWHA are\nstigmatized. In addition, the data collected with this\nscale can be used to tailor interventions aimed at more\neffectively adressing stigma.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Exploratory factor analysis of the SAT-PLWHA-S.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nMB, AA, CD and LP participated in the design of the study.
