To date, we have given nearly $19 million through almost 3,000 grants, and we must continue to do this work—and much more—given today’s harsh economic realities. Joblessness and financial insecurity affect women and girls profoundly, and CFW won’t shy away from the complexity of women’s lives. We support programs that tackle many issues simultaneously. We work at the intersections of women’s lives.We acknowledge demographics like age, race and income but we also focus on women’s lived experiences: the barriers presented by domestic violence, homelessness and lack of health care, as well as the lessons gained through motherhood, immigration and education.To ensure girls’ future economic security, for example, we must examine the intersection of education and gender-based violence. When schools take dating violence, sexual assault and bullying seriously, they create safer classrooms where students can succeed. Women at the intersection of motherhood and incarceration deserve community-based sentences instead of jail time for minor offenses. This way, we can keep families whole and stop the generational cycle of poverty. Communities of color live at the intersection of racial inequality and reproductive justice, bearing the brunt of laws and policies restricting reproductive freedoms. To turn the tide we must invest in grassroots advocacy led by women of color, whose policy work is transforming the political landscape locally and nationally. Chicago Foundation for Women will stand strong at these intersections—and many, many more—thanks to the generosity and dedication of thousands of donors who share our vision: a world in which all women and girls have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. Thank you for your support. Andrea S. Kramer K.

The high school girls who go on the All Girls Expedition might track collared coyotes and study geysers, but that’s only part of the trip’s purpose. Another is leadership development.As with all its programming, Project Exploration doesn’t choose girls who are already high achievers—they look for girls who just need an opportunity to fulfill their potential.constance robinson, a 2011 Woodlawn Secondary School graduate, went on her second expedition this summer and took on the responsibility of team leader.“I had to mentor the other girls who were coming in, with different backgrounds,” Constance said. “Once you show you have confidence people are drawn to you. If a team leader isn’t really out there, then the group won’t be, so you have to be confident for your group.”The All Girls Expedition divides into groups to study topics of their choice, first for a week in the classroom and then for a week on-site in Wyoming. Constance’s focus was geology, and she hopes to build that into her pre-med coursework at Penn State this fall.More than 60% of Project Exploration participants choose college majors in science, but that’s not the only goal, explained PE co-founder and executive director Gabrielle lyon.  “For students who are really disenfranchised because of the educational system, there’s an incredibly important equity issue around not having the ability to develop the skills they need. Science gives girls fluency with analysis, with evidence. It can broaden their horizons.”Poignantly, Constance’s favorite memory of the All Girls Expedition was literally the horizon.  “Growing up in Chicago you don’t get to see the stars,” Constance said. “One night in Yellowstone, we gazed at the sky. We saw part of the Milky Way and shooting stars, and I was in awe.”Working at the intersections of…science and  girls’ leadershipn n u l r e p o r O R K I N G A T T H E I N T E R S E C T I O N S 5Above: Constance Robinson (left) and University of Chicago biologist Heather King examine the vertebrae of an elk found on a wildlife hike during grantee Project Exploration’s All Girls Expedition to Yellowstone National Park.Inset: Attendees of Project Exploration’s Girls’ Health and Science Day receive accurate information on bodies, relationships, self-defense and sexuality.C h i C a g o  F o u n d a t i o n  F o r  W o m e n  •  w w w . c f w . o r g6Chicago Women’s Health Center, Inc.: $4,000The Trans Inclusion Program is committed to breaking down assumptions about gender and sex and offering affordable, respectful and accessible health care and education to the Chicago and vicinity trans communities.Links – Northshore youth Health Service: $3,000Sappho’s Sisters provides a safe and confidential space for lesbian and bisexual young women in the north and northwest suburbs of Chicago.

That’s why she hosted an intimate, high-energy party in December 2010 at her Kenilworth home.“Asking for donations is difficult, especially the traditional one-on-one approach,” Ginny said. “Hosting a party brings people together and helps everyone recognize that we’re a community that can pool our resources to improve women’s lives, and that’s powerful.” That’s why Crain’s Chicago Business ran an article about Ginny’s fundraiser and other creative tools that nonprofits are using to raise money in a difficult economic climate. In fact, including three additional events in the Loop, Hyde Park and Oak Park, the house parties raised more than $50,000 last year.Hosting house parties to raise funds isn’t a new idea, but it’s effective when done well, CFW President/CEO K. Sujata explains. “A recent study shows that women are the most generous with their money at nearly every income level, yet they rarely recognize themselves as philanthropists. Women are still the best champions for the issues that affect their lives, and those are the issues that CFW addresses.”Ginny continued, “Once you hear first-hand the stories of women and girls overcoming adversity, whether it’s in Chicago or the suburbs, people can really see the difference their dollars can make.  This is what makes philanthropy inspiring and empowering.”One grantee that shared its story was Alternatives, inc., whose Girl-Driven Research Project lets teen girls in Uptown research a social justice topic of their choice. It includes a philanthropic aspect: the teens get to choose local nonprofits that address the issue they’re studying—recently, the negative depictions of youth of color in mainstream media—to receive small grants. As Ginny said to her friends and neighbors, “These girls think big and envision a better world, and that’s something I feel good about supporting.” Working at the intersections of…friendship and fundraisingH I A G O O U N D A T I O N O R O M E N W W W F W GAbove: Ginny Holt (center) welcomed more than 150 people to her home to hear about CFW’s impact in the community.

It’s perhaps no coincidence that small nonprofits have difficulty recruiting dedicated board members from diverse backgrounds, and myriad women who support CFW—including members of the Leadership Councils—say they feel unprepared to step into that role. To close this gap, this year Chicago Foundation for Women launched the Board Boot Camp to train women for board service and then match them with Chicago’s most effective nonprofits.Supported by Crown Family Philanthropies, the two-and-a-half day Board Boot Camp in June 2011 offered interactive workshops to 38 Chicago-area women from various professions, neighborhoods and backgrounds. The curriculum covered board roles and responsibilities, nonprofit financials, how to run effective meetings, and the basics of fundraising.Although she had already served her first year on a board, African American Leadership Council member jennifer Franklin said the training gave her the tools she didn’t realize she would need. “Although I got lucky with [CFW grantee] Rape Victim Advocates, had I realized how much I would need to know, I probably would’ve tried to seek out training before joining a board,” said Jennifer. Likewise Allison lowe-Fotos, a steering committee member of the Young Women’s Leadership Council, says the boot camp made her feel prepared for board service—and she was struck by the diversity of participants. “I was expecting, I don’t know why, mostly younger women,” Allison said, “but we were all there to learn, and we were learning so much, including from each other.”“I was really impressed with all of the candidates’ preparation,” said Kathy miller, director of communications and development at the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, a CFW grantee. Kathy took part in an evening matchmaking reception sponsored by the Pierce Family Foundation, where dozens of nonprofits set up information tables for Board Boot Camp participants. Kathy said, “These women did their homework about CTBA, asked me good questions and knew concrete ways they could help us.”Working at the intersections of…diversity and community servicen n u l r e p o r O R K I N G A T T H E I N T E R S E C T I O N S 15Above: The graduates from Chicago Foundation for Women’s inaugural Board Boot Camp rated their experience highly, and CFW is planning a repeat of the successful program soon.Inset: Kathy Miller (left) tells  Jennifer Franklin about the mission and board member requirements  of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability at the Board Boot Camp’s networking night. C h i C a g o  F o u n d a t i o n  F o r  W o m e n  •  w w w . c f w . o r g16nancy juda can give you three good reasons why she supports Chicago Foundation for Women. First she points out that as a feminist she loves the mission of helping women and girls, and second she notes the importance of the local focus on the Chicago area. The third reason, however, sticks out.“Laziness,” laughed Nancy, a CFW board member. “Seriously, I can count on the fact that my dollars will go to the right places. The work has already been done to find strategic, effective organizations that can make a big difference.”Nancy’s humility sells her short—she is the hard-working vice-chair of the Program Committee, which oversees CFW’s volunteer-driven grantmaking process. Community volunteers and board members assist staff in reviewing grant applications, selecting which groups move forward and then visiting prospective grantees’ program sites to learn more about their work. Nancy has gone on at least a dozen site visits over the past few years, she said. “I’m really moved by the work these groups are doing with a minimum of resources,” Nancy said. “Every community has different needs, stories and opportunities.”As an artist, Nancy enjoyed volunteering at a mosaic tile workshop as part of CFW’s 25th anniversary celebration. The tiles are part of a mural honoring Jane Addams installed in Chicago’s Streeterville neighborhood, a CFW-funded project of Chicago Public Art Group and lead artist Mirtes Zwierzynski.Whether wearing the hat of artist, board member or donor, Nancy said she feels a connection  to the Foundation. “I find that what I have to bring to the table is valued. My voice is valued. Frankly, if what we’re about is empowering women and girls, I’m one of them. I get empowered  by being here.”Working at the intersections of…feminism and philanthropyH I A G O O U N D A T I O N O R O M E N W W W F W GAbove: Nancy Juda (center) with her guest Morgan Weller (left) and CFW staff member Linda L.
