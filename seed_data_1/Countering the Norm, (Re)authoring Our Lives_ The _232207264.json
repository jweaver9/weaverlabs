Alex Wagaman1 , Rae Caballero Obejero1, and James S. Gregory1AbstractCounterstorytelling, a methodology that is rooted in critical race theory, is undergirded by principles that are beneficial tounderstanding the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer-identified (LGBTQ) young people from anintersectional perspective. Counterstorytelling holds promise as a method that creates opportunities for individual transfor-mation and resistance to dominant narratives among young people facing systemic oppression. This article outlines the design andimplementation of a counterstorytelling study with LGBTQ youth and reflects on the value and associated challenges of coun-terstorytelling as a participatory research method.Keywordscommunity-based research, critical theory, emancipatory research methods in qualitative inquiry, narrativeWhat Is Already Known?This article builds on existing knowledge about the use ofcounterstorytelling as a qualitative methodology. It is knownthat counterstorytelling contributes to insight about the ways inwhich populations of young people who face societal margin-alization make sense of the dominant narratives about theirlives, as well as the ways in which they create their own coun-ternarratives as a form of resistance.What This Paper Adds?This article extends the application of counterstorytelling as aqualitative research methodology to explore its value in under-standing the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, andqueer-identified (LGBTQ) young people at the intersections ofmultiple identities. In particular, the article outlines the designof such a study, identifying lessons learned from a specificstudy conducted with LGBTQ youth in the United States.Much of the existing counterstorytelling literature is missingdepth in its description of the method.“Words have the power to encourage and inspire, but also todemean and dehumanize. I know now that epithets are meant togame us into not being ourselves, to encourage us to perform lies,and to be silent about our truths.”(Mock, 2014, p. 31)Youth and young adults who experience forms of marginaliza-tion and oppression are often silenced by existing dominantnarratives that are reproduced, rather than questioned, throughtraditional research methods. Methods that limit our ability tocall into question taken-for-granted assumptions and socialnarratives silence the lived experiences that counter those nar-ratives. Without the ability to counter existing narratives, theability to create meaningful social change is limited. A methodfor stepping into spaces of silence and asking what lies there,instead of assuming that the untold stories reflect what wealready know, has the power to increase the depth of our under-standing of marginalized groups of youth, including lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender and queer-identified (LGBTQ)youth. Counterstorytelling as a methodology offers us a frame-work for employing such a method.Counterstorytelling is a qualitative research methodologygrounded in principles of critical race theory and intended asa process for telling the lived experiences of people who are1 School of Social Work, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,VA, USACorresponding Author:M.

Throughcounterstorytelling, taken-for-granted assumptions and domi-nant norms are made visible (Solo´rzano & Yosso, 2001). Storyreclamation can be used as a form of resistance that calls intoquestion the existing practices of narrative reproduction (Costaet al., 2012). This article describes an exploration of the theo-retical and methodological parallels between counterstorytell-ing and the concept of queer world-making (Duong, 2012) thathas emerged from queer theory.Queer world-making is a process of utopian thinking andbeing that engages in resistance to that which is normative(Warner, 2002). The term “queer,” as it is used in queer theory,is “ . . . conceptually elastic, unrestrained, and open-ended”(Yep, 2003, p. 35), which theoretically opens up all possibili-ties for a future world (Jagose, 1996). In the case of LGBTQþpeople, it is a process of envisioning a world in which hetero-sexuality is not normalized in every aspect of society (Halperin,1995; Kumashiro, 2002). And for some, queer world-makinginvolves the practice of living into that envisioned worldthrough such behaviors as identity assertion, language use, andmore (Jagose, 1996).While counterstorytelling has been primarily used as amethodology to centralize race in the experiences and narra-tives of people of color, it also has value as a methodology tocentralize other aspects of identity through an intersectionallens (Solo´rzano & Yosso, 2002). This article explores the appli-cation of counterstorytelling—putting theory into practice—togauge the impact and value of counterstorytelling as a metho-dology that supports the interruption of dominant social narra-tives for LGBTQ youth.The authors designed and implemented a counterstorytell-ing study with LGBTQ young people. What follows is adescription of the design and implementation of this study,including the guiding principles that served as a design frame-work. Included are reflections on the challenges and value ofapplying this methodology in research with LGBTQ youth andother populations of youth who experience marginalization andsystemic oppression.LGBTQ YouthThe landscape for LGBTQ youth in the United States is shiftingsocially and politically. In recent years, we have witnessedincreased rights related to marriage and family and dramati-cally increased transgender visibility. Youth have been at theforefront of movements to increase safety and inclusion inschools (Russell, Muraco, Subramaniam, & Laub, 2009) andensure that LGBTQ advocacy efforts consider the intersec-tional experiences of LGBTQ-identified people (Wagaman,2015). Despite these changes, LGBTQ youth still face a num-ber of systemic barriers to achieving their full potential inadulthood. Research has consistently documented the impactof discrimination and marginalization faced by LGBTQ youthon their well-being (Saewyc, 2011). It is this impact—high riskof suicide (Liu & Mustanski, 2012), homelessness (Durso &Gates, 2012), mental health concerns (Almeida, Johnson,Corliss, Molnar, & Azrael, 2009)—that is most reflected in thedominant social narrative about LGBTQ youth (Goltz, 2013;Hillier & Harrison, 2004). For LGBTQ youth, dominant narra-tives “inform cultural and societal values about gender andsexual identities that render some expressions normative andothers illegitimate” (Owens, 2010, p. 43). Such narratives alsocreate a social expectation for how LGBTQ youth shouldrespond to their environments. For example, a U.S.-basedmedia campaign launched by Dan Savage sent the messageto LGBTQ youth that “It Gets Better,” suggesting that LGBTQyouth experience bullying and suicidality and that if they can“hang on” until adulthood, then things will turn around and bebetter for them (Savage & Miller, 2011). While this narrativeresonated with many LGBTQ youth, the response from youthwho created a countercampaign called “Make It Better” sug-gests that the narrative of waiting until adulthood for things tobe better did not resonate with young people who felt com-pelled to engage in change efforts (Majkowski, 2011). Thisbroader narrative of risk and suicide for LGBTQ youth estab-lishes a social expectation for how youth should generallyrespond to a hostile environment.Compounding the risks associated with experiences of dis-crimination, rigid social categories such as gender rely on bin-aries that limit a full expression of identity among youth(Markman, 2011). Similarly, many of the systems and supportsthat are in place to nurture and guide youth into adulthoodunfairly monitor or sanction LGBTQ youth, including schools(Kosciw, Greytak, Palmer, & Boesen, 2014) and the juvenilejustice system (Himmelstein & Bru¨ckner, 2011; Majd, Marsa-mer, & Reyes, 2009). These systems are often guided byresearch that has limited our understanding of the breadth anddepth of experiences within this diverse population and repli-cated the oppressive role that other institutions and systemsplay in the lives of LGBTQ youth.Rather than re-creating knowledge that encouragesresponses requiring LGBTQ youth to adapt to or cope withexisting oppressive structures, alternative research methods arerequired in order to access knowledge that reflects the reality oftheir experiences in all of its complexity (Burrell & Morgan,1979; Lincoln, Lynham, & Guba, 2011; O’Connor & Netting,2009) and interrupts the dominant narrative(s) of risk that limitour ability to imagine a world defined by those who existoutside of accepted structures of gender and sexuality (Duong,2012; Owens, 2010).LGBTQ Youth and NarrativesUngar and Teram (2000) found that youth facing risk use per-sonal narratives to construct identities that are outside of thesocial discourses that define them. Storytelling has been usedwith LGBTQ youth as a tool for empowerment (Llera &Katsirebas, 2010). LGBTQ youth are aware of the dominantnarratives that exist about them and able to reject the aspects ofthese narratives they do not perceive as helpful (Hillier &Harrison, 2004; McEntarfer & McVee, 2014). As such,2 International Journal of Qualitative Methodsstorytelling may be a useful tool to understand resilience andresistance strategies among LGBTQ youth.Queer theorists have identified the concept of “queer world-making” as a process that occurs through the everyday expres-sions of LGBTQ-identified people as they push the boundariesof the gender binary or claim their sexual and gender identitiesin places where they are silenced or encouraged to be invisible(Duong, 2012). Duong (2012) posits that LGBTQ young peo-ple are using their lives to create a world in which queerness isno longer in the margins. Rather than waiting for the world tochange around them, they are creating the kind of world theywant to see in the future. In this way, their lives are shaping anew narrative—as they simultaneously resist the narrative thathas been established for them. Counterstorytelling is a metho-dology that creates an opportunity for LGBTQ youth to puttheir narratives—both those that they live and those that theyenvision—in conversation with existing dominant narrativesthat stifle them.Counterstorytelling and LGBTQ YouthCounterstorytelling is a methodology that has promise for usewith LGBTQ youth, given the shifting nature of the environ-mental context, intersectional experiences, and dominant nar-ratives that frame LGBTQ youth through a risk frameworktaking for granted the existence of a status quo that normalizesa hostile environment (Solorzano & Yosso, 2001). The processof counterstorytelling seeks to “listen less for stories of healingand recovery and more for stories of resistance and opposition”(Costa et al., 2012, p. 96). By creating the spaces for youth totell a different story about themselves and to contextualize itwithin the dominant narratives, youth can begin to identifyways that they have power to create change in the institutionsthat impact them (Solorzano & Yosso, 2002).Current StudyCounterstorytelling has not been used often in research withLGBTQ young people. Little is known about its applicationand implementation with this population. This article willoutline the development and implementation of a 6-week coun-terstorytelling study with a diverse group of nine LGBTQ-identified youth. Participants were intentionally recruited toequalize power related to racial and gender identities. Studyparticipants attended six 2-hr, counterstorytelling focus groupsonce each week during which time they participated in a seriesof activities that included naming the dominant narratives intheir lives, countering those narratives, telling individual stor-ies, and identifying outlets to present their stories. Prior todetailing the study design, it is important to understand theprinciples that provided the design framework. These princi-ples were identified through the underlying theoretical frame-work of critical race theory, queer theory, intersectionality, andparticipatory action research (PAR) philosophy.Guiding PrinciplesThe following guiding principles were established to serve as aframework for the design of the study. The first principle is thatthere is value in creating and occupying shared space (Delgado,1989). We knew that some voices and experiences had beenprivileged in the dominant narratives about queer youth overothers and that it would be important to create a space whereyouth could come together from various identities and experi-ences. The second guiding principle was that we would honorone another’s truths, which is an acknowledgment that we wereapproaching this from a paradigm that acknowledges there aremultiple truths (Burrell & Morgan, 1979). This principle wasimportant because we wanted to design a study that did not aimto distill the stories or identify value in some stories over oth-ers. The third guiding principle was that we would work to keepprivileged voices from dominating. This guiding principle wasparticularly important as we thought about the inclusion ofparticipants at the intersections of identities around ability,race, and class in addition to sexual orientation and genderidentity. Finally, the fourth guiding principle was to avoid“othering.” “Othering” occurs when a preestablished norm isused to compare people against thereby emphasizing those whodiffer from it rather than calling the norm itself into question.“Othering” can occur when the master or dominant narrative isestablished as the norm, which puts all other narratives into adeficit framework (Solorzano & Yosso, 2001).PAR, which is a methodology and philosophy grounded inthe belief that traditional research participants are the experts intheir lives and experiences (Barbera, 2008), was used to informthe development of this study as well. PAR and counterstory-telling are aligned theoretically (Brydon-Miller, Kral, Maguire,Noffke, & Sabhlok, 2011) and given the limited use of counter-storytelling with queer youth in the literature, and the fact thatcounterstorytelling as a method has been used in a variety ofways (Griffin, Ward, & Phillips, 2014; Munoz & Maldonado,2012), it was imperative in this study that the participants alsoserve in an active role around shaping and designing theresearch methods and the “space” within which the study tookplace. As such, PAR principles and methods were threadedthroughout the emergent design of this study. More specifi-cally, the youth participatory action research (YPAR) princi-ples as defined by Rodriguez and Brown (2009) helped toframe the implementation of this study. Those principlesinclude inquiry-based, participatory, and transformative. It isimportant to note here that this was not a PAR or YPAR study.Rather, the principles were used to inform aspects of the studydesign and implementation to enhance (1) relevance of thestudy to the lives and concerns of the young people involved,(2) participation in creating the pedagogical and methodologi-cal space, and (3) the potential for transformation at an indi-vidual, group, or community level (Rodriguez & Brown, 2009).The ways in which these principles were applied will be high-lighted in the study description.The principles as outlined above were used to design a coun-terstorytelling study that took place between April and MayWagaman et al. 32014. When we were uncertain about decision-making related todesign and process, we went back to these principles and theguiding theories. The details of the design are described below.Researcher ReflexivityGiven the decision-making power that was held by theresearchers who designed and implemented the study, it isimportant to understand the lens through which decisions weremade. The primary researcher is a middle-aged, White, cisgen-der woman who is a PhD-educated faculty member at a uni-versity. Her experience in social work practice is largely in thearea of youth and community organizing, which informs herapproach to academic research. The second researcher is aFilipino, transgender man who was within the same age rangeas the target age for the participants at the time of the study. Hewas studying social work at the time that the study was beingconducted. The researchers engaged in reflexive meetingsbefore and after each focus group session and engaged inreflexive journaling throughout the study.Study DesignThe counterstorytelling study received institutional reviewboard approval through the university. The time parametersthat were established for the study included weekly focusgroup meetings for 6 weeks. Each meeting was 2 hrs in lengthand was audio-recorded. Participants were paid a cash incen-tive at the end of each focus group that they attended, and ameal was provided.Based on the guiding principles, we knew that attentionwould need to be paid to both the “space” that was created forthis study to occur within and the data collection protocol thatwas used to carry out the study. By “space,” we are referring tothe physical space as well as the environment that was createdthrough the representation of people involved in the study, andthe guidelines we established for how those involved wouldengage with one another. By data collection protocol, we meanthe activities, questions, and procedures used to guide how thetime was spent in the study for the purposes of generating andcollecting data. The protocol was preplanned but had emergentqualities as will be described below, which reflected a partici-patory nature. The study space and data collection protocol arenot clearly delineated—they are, in fact, fairly interconnected.However, we will describe each component separately below.Within each, we will give examples of the ways in which theguiding principles were incorporated into the design.SpaceRecruitment and participant selection. An important aspect of theintentional creation of a space was the participant recruitmentand selection process. An outreach and recruitment plan wasdeveloped with the goal of reaching a diverse group of LGBTQyouth ages 18–24. Young people who expressed interest in thestudy participated in a screening process during which theyresponded to questions about various aspects of their identities,including age, sexual orientation, gender identity, racial andethnic identity, (dis)ability, education level, and current atten-dance in school. The screening tool was developed withoutpreselected categorical options within each aspect of identity.Young people self-defined their identities. This created a pro-cess within which the participants could be selected to reflectdiversity but also reflect the complexity of identity and differ-ence that exists when people are given space to self-define.This was a component of the study that reflected the YPARprinciple of being inquiry-based (Rodriguez & Brown, 2009)because it enhanced the relevance of the study for the partici-pants by centering their lives/identities as they defined anddescribed them from the very beginning—the screening pro-cess. Similarly, it helped to set the tone for avoiding “othering.”Once a diverse pool had been screened, the researchers cre-ated a matrix to select the most diverse group possible. Atten-tion was paid to balance within the group around key identities,such as race, in order to minimize the dominance of privilegedvoices. The number of participants was kept within the boundsof a productive focus group to support the potential for deepengagement. A total of 10 young people were selected from thesample pool; 9 of whom participated. In addition to the diver-sity of participants, the researchers represented diverse per-spectives and made intentional use of this in the study.Journals. Another aspect of the study space was the inclusion ofjournals. The researchers purchased a journal for each partici-pant as a way of acknowledging that some people prefer tointernally reflect prior to engaging in dialogue. It was alsointended as a tool for story development. However, the journalsbecame a much more prominent tool in the group’s processthan was originally intended. The journals were used in multi-ple ways: (1) to write down things that were said that sparkedthought or were inspirational, (2) to channel reactions to whatothers said in the group and to encourage group members torefrain from interrupting, and (3) to make notes about points ofconnection with other group members. During the first meetingwhen the journals were distributed, the participants asked thatthe researchers not look at the journals in between meetings.The researchers agreed to comply with the request but collectedthe journals at the end of each meeting, so that they would notbe misplaced or forgotten. Each week, they were redistributedat the beginning of the meeting. At the end of the 6 weeklysessions, participants were asked to tear out any pieces of theirjournals that they were willing to share or leave behind for theresearchers to include as data. The journals were an importanttool to uphold the principle of not allowing privileged voices todominate. Early in the study, it became clear that the whiteparticipants were more assertive about participating verbally,at times talking over participants who identified as people ofcolor. The journals helped to minimize that pattern of commu-nication after the group explicitly identified that the dynamicwas inhibiting participation. The group-developed norms(described below) supported the group’s capacity to directlyaddress this issue through collective discussion and identify4 International Journal of Qualitative Methodsthe journals as a tool for resisting the urge to speak as soon as athought came to mind.Group-developed norms. The third aspect of space that wasimportant to the effective implementation of the counterstory-telling study was the collective development of group norms.During the first meeting, the group was introduced to the ideaof counterstorytelling and the general plan for the 6-weekstudy. Based on that understanding, the group worked togetherto develop a set of norms for how they could interact with oneanother in order to maximize inclusion and comfort with thestorytelling process. As a part of these norms, one participantalso recommended a ritual for checking in and out with oneanother each week that involved a one word description of howeach person was feeling or doing in that moment. This ritualwas agreed to by the group and helped to set the tone forknowing what each participant was bringing into the groupwith them from the day or the week, as well as where theywere emotionally as the group came to a close. Again, thisreflected the YPAR principle of being participatory, as thegroup members took ownership over the space and articulatedwhat their needs were in order to fully participate. This ritualreinforced the value of occupying shared space. Similarly, itsupported the YPAR principle of transformation. Participantswere able to create a space that allowed for their own explo-ration of the ways in which dominant social messages affectedthem and, in some cases, identify the ways that they uninten-tionally reinforce unhealthy messages with themselves and oneanother—indicating group-level transformation. The partici-pants began to build insight into and relationships with oneanother that supported a level of comfort that would have dif-fered in, for example, an interview setting.Upon development of a set of norms, it was emphasized bythe researchers that the norms should be considered flexible andthat norms could be added or edited as needed by the group.Through the discussion, it was made clear that the group may notbe able to fully anticipate what their needs are for future aspectsof the process and that was alright. As a result of this discussion,one participant asked if the group could have a norm that “editsand re-dos” would be allowed. The group agreed that a norm thatsupported each other’s ability to see their stories as works inprogress was valuable, which reflected their ability to create aspace that honored one another’s truths as being in process.Emergent Design: Data Collection MethodsThe study design had six primary components. Figure 1 illus-trates the relationship between the components, all of whichwere planned prior to implementation with room for emergencein and between them. In the figure, an asterisk denotes thosecomponents that had an emergent, participatory nature to them.The components are described in greater detail below in a waythat merges the planned and emergent to illustrate the resultingdesign and the factors that impacted it.Iterative Nature of the ProcessThe components of the research design were interconnected anditerative. The three rounds of narrative development reflectedback on what had come before in the study’s process. Similarly,the process of story sharing was iterative and was adapted overtime as the group worked to identify what they needed from oneanother and how to best support each other’s individuality. Theprocess allowed the participants to come to a deep understandingof the uniqueness of each storyteller and each listener. Reflectivedialogue is a process that allows participants to discuss theirreflections on what they heard, what thoughts or feelings weregenerated during both the listening and the telling, and what theywitnessed in the process. Incorporation of reflective dialoguewas an important aspect of the iterative process.Similarly, the design components and space were intimatelyconnected to one another. For example, the storytelling andsharing process impacted the space by creating a level of inti-macy, trust, and comfort. However, that comfort level some-times resulted in participants slipping into essentialist languageor making statements that caused offense in other participants.These instances required a looping back to revisit what the spaceshould look and feel like (such as refining the norms) in order toallow for a deeper level of comfort without forgetting the vastdifferences in identity and experiences within the room.Design ComponentsDominant narratives. Once the concept of counterstorytellingwas introduced, the researchers facilitated a discussion aboutthe concept of a dominant narrative in the second session. Thisbegan with a dialogue about the use of stories in our own livesand in society. The group related to the idea that there wereFigure 1. Counterstorytelling design components with iterativerelationships and participatory aspects.Wagaman et al. 5messages in society about LGBTQ young people that wereeither explicitly or implicitly conveyed. The participantswere asked to individually write these messages on separatepieces of paper—one message on each sheet of paper. Theresearchers put the messages up on a wall in the room. Thisallowed for the group to visually examine and discuss themessages together. Examples of messages that were identi-fied by the participants included:\u0002 Coming out leads to either: COMPLETE ACCEP-TANCE or COMPETE REJECTION\u0002 You can’t use “they” because my view of grammar ismore important than your feelings and existence.\u0002 “MAN GETS PREGNANT”\u0002 Oh, those poor gay/queer folks in the South, everythingmust be so horrible there.\u0002 Too pretty to be a lesbian\u0002 It’s “easier” to be gay now\u0002 “Last night, a <LGBTQ> person was killed!”\u0002 “Wow you’re from (country that is not in the west) itmust be so hard to be gay there. I’m glad you left.”Once the messages were placed on the wall, the participantstalked about the messages they had written. They were encour-aged to ask for clarification about a message that someone elsehad written if it was unclear to them. The discussion was thendirected toward an analysis of the messages and the dominantnarrative(s) that they create. This included questions related to(1) reactions to the messages, (2) points of similarity and con-tradiction in the messages, (3) how and where the messages arecommunicated and learned, and (4) what stories and groupsseem to be missing from the messages. The following quotefrom the discussion reflects the ways in which the participantscompared the dominant narratives to their own lives.I feel like these stories are exposed from media . . . are heavilyedited to be very compelling and . . . entertaining. But for me, if Iam literally trying to tell someone the story of my life a part of it isnot going to be all that entertaining, it’s not going to be like bam,bam, bam, it’s not going to be exciting like that. It’s going to be allfull of confusion and personal . . . stuff. I feel like the more a storybecomes really catchy the less close it is to the truth.This discussion was used as a segue way into the second andthird components of the research design—caucus groups andthe development of counter narratives.Caucus groups. Caucus groups was a design component intendedto create space for people to talk within identity groups in orderto identify common experiences, build confidence in givingvoice to experiences that may not otherwise be represented,and acknowledge that there are differences in experiencewithin the group. The idea of caucus groups was introducedin the first session of the study. Participants were encouraged torequest caucus group time whenever it felt like something thatthey needed. Going into the third session, the request had notbeen made of the group. The researchers decided, based on thediscussion in the previous session about the dominant narra-tive(s), that caucus space would be beneficial to the group priorto the development of counterstories.The group was asked by the researchers what identities wereimportant to them to have intragroup time with. Three differentcaucus spaces were chosen around race, gender identity, andsexual orientation. During the first caucus group, participantsself-identified as either white or as a person of color and wentwith the corresponding small group. For the second caucusgroup, participants self-identified as either transgender (includ-ing binary and nonbinary trans identities) or cisgender. And forthe third caucus group, participants self-identified as eithermonosexual or “multi”sexual (including bisexual, pansexual).The group recognized the challenges associated with breakingthese identities into binary groups, but given the number ofparticipants and their perception of common experience, thesegroups were selected. The group-driven selection of identitiesto shape caucuses reflected the participatory and emergentnature of the research design.The groups were given time to discuss the followingquestions, or anything that they determined was importantfor them to discuss while together. Caucus groups were notaudio-recorded.\u0002 In what ways are the stories we have been talking aboutdifferent for us?\u0002 What stories or groups of people are missing from thestories we hear or see being told?\u0002 What is the impact of all of this on us?Once all three caucus group times were done, the group wasbrought back together. Participants were asked to share what-ever seemed important or relevant for the rest of the group. Thiscomponent was used to directly transition into the developmentof the individual counterstories.CounterstoriesReflecting on the messages from the dominant narrative(s) andthe discussions that followed, the participants were asked toconsider the stories or aspects of the LGBTQ youth experiencethat were missing from the dominant narrative. Participantswere asked to imagine that they were in charge of telling thestory and to develop a (re)telling of what we had generated thusfar. These counterstories were not intended to be the partici-pants’ personal narratives, but the group discussed the ways inwhich they might use the aspects of their own experiences inthe counternarratives. Creativity was encouraged. The creativeaspect of the counterstory development and telling reflectedparticipatory principles, and as will be illustrated below, theparticipants used poetry or other forms of expression to telltheir counterstories. Time was given within the session to workon the stories. Many of the participants also worked on them inbetween the session meetings. Participants were told that theywould be sharing their counter narratives at the next meeting6 International Journal of Qualitative Methodsand were asked to aim to keep their counterstories to 5 minor less.Before telling each other the counterstories, the researchersfacilitated a discussion about listening and its importance in theprocess of storytelling. The group engaged in a dialogue aboutthe various ways that they listen to others and what makes themfeel listened to. It became clear that different people had dif-ferent needs and expectations. So, the group decided that priorto each story sharing, the storyteller would communicate withthe group about how they wanted to be listened to—whatwould make them feel heard. It was also decided that therewould not be questions or discussion after each story but ratherthat the group would collectively discuss after all of the coun-terstories had been told. Excerpts of a few of the counterstoriesthat resulted are quoted below.Counterstory 1The person in this story is just Name. Name is a disabled, black,trans, young, poor and undocumented person living in the UnitedStates, may have both physically disabled and have been diag-nosed with a learning disorder. Name is brilliant though, self-taught, library, the public library is a haven. Society doesn’t knowwhat to do with Name, cast her out, tell him he’s unemployable,not eligible, too deviant. Name is the untouchable. Name existsprimarily between the margins, but because Name is lighterskinned and generally attractive, they do own some of the aes-thetic privilege. They own it. They use it, fire it at will to get whatthey need and want. Name is unapologetically fierce, unapologe-tically genuine. They live in their self because that’s what marginsource people like Name need to do. If there were systems set upto help Name stop struggling, because Name does struggle, andstart flourishing, most people marginalized or not would alsoflourish. And I just drew a little triangle and that’s where Namewould be on the bottom.Counterstory 2They told me that God made me beautifully. He painted my eyesand built the curves in my body. My aunt tells me that God mademe this way so I could grace a man with my humble smile and mypresence and one day, I will tell God that, I’ve fallen in love andwow, God, you made her beautifully too.Counterstory 3Hmm. Okay, so basically, I don’t feel comfortable filling in theblanks for someone else. For me, a story that should be told isplain, yet very idealistic. The story or the format is vague andnoncommittal or not existent at all or yeah. It is accepting of otherstories and recognizes there will never be replicas. Understanding,inclusive. Like, “Hey, this is me and whether you’re similar or not,it’s okay. I’m still okay and valid. You’re still okay and valid.”Because the story’s open and comforting while remaining comfor-table, all details would be shared. Nothing’s held back. It’s a storywhere the reality shapes the language, not vice versa. Asknowledge expands, lives expand and develop, language expandsand develops to match. Are gone the present limitations, unwantedsuperimposed boundaries found when relying on words that fallshort. My reality is not complete with a vocabulary at disposal ofmost—at the disposal of most. Customized—customizable combi-nations of lesser that haven’t been used or are made to explainevery unique experience and still have it be understood. The storythat must be told is one where someone successfully dismantlesassumptions and accepted the abstract or whatever had been pre-sented. The story should have its own language and should beasked to share it. Language shouldn’t limit our reality or our wantto speak it. Anyway, that’s it. That’s all I wrote.Storytelling model(s). The fourth component of the researchdesign created an opportunity for the group to step outside ofthe individual stories and to think about the role and structureof stories in society. To begin this discussion, the researcherspresented a storytelling model that is used by the New Orga-nizing Institute, adapted from the work of Marshall Ganz atHarvard University, to teach activists about how to tell theirstory in public settings to engage others in a particular effort ormovement. The model has three primary components: (1) achallenge that is faced by the teller; (2) a choice that has tobe made, often in response to the challenge; and (3) an outcomethat is a result of the choice. The model was presented to thegroup, and a facilitated discussion followed that included theparticipants’ reactions to the model and other models for tellingone’s story. The following quotes were selected to illustrate thenature of this discussion. The first two quotes are from parti-cipants who were speaking about their ability to fit their ownstory into the model that was presented. In their assessment,this would be difficult to do.But, um—but you know for like here like I just had some ideasfloating around my head like I wanted to talk about like cross-dressing and stigma and shame and stuff, and like I don’t knowhow I could like shoehorn that into a narrative that involves likechallenge, choice and outcome, you know? It’s just more like allthis stuff happened and I felt bad, and now it’s like I don’t care,you know?Um, on top of that—because this is a personal narrative—Idon’t know that we necessarily know like the full outcome . . .The following quotes are from participants’ discussion aboutthe model and how it compares with other ways of tellingstories. The idea that there might be both dominant narrativesand a dominant narrative structure emerged in this dialogue,which created an important bridge to the fifth component of thedesign, the personal narrative.Oh gosh. Um, I—I remember that there’s, uh, like this like snow-flake model of the story: I just can’t remember like what it means.It’s like you—you have like a central idea and then you like build itall outward from—and then like you put it altogether in the story.I feel like a storytelling model doesn’t necessarily take intoaccount all of the different stories that we have because we don’tWagaman et al. 7just have like one thing going on. So how can we talk about some-thing that’s like all of these things?I think risk—if we’re all restricted to one model of storytelling itwould marry our stories too much, in trying to maybe feel like, ‘Ohwell, I didn’t have it as hard as that person,’ and so—like theirstory is more important or some kind of feelings like that. Whenreally—like everything is really complicated and there’s so muchgoing on at once.Personal narratives. The personal narratives were completelywithin the control of the participants. There were no guidelinesor expectations about content, but the researchers did ask thatthey be kept to 5 min each. Participants were encouraged tofollow whatever narrative format they felt made most sense forthem, and creativity in the telling was encouraged. Participantshad time in the session to prepare their narratives.Prior to sharing their narratives, the group revisited its storysharing structure and expectations for the listeners and theteller. It was agreed that the process would be similar to thatused during the counter-story sharing. However, because thelisteners often felt compelled to respond in some way after astory had been told, the group agreed that they would all say“yo” or “I hear you” after each story. This was identified as away to limit verbal responses that might result in a discussionor feel like an assessment of the story’s value. This process ofrevisiting the process and adapting it to meet the needs of thegroup is another aspect of the design that reflected the partici-patory and emergent nature of the design.Once ready, the stories were told one by one in the group.The following quotes are excerpts from selected personal nar-ratives to reflect the range of stories.Personal narrative 1The story is not about the times that I’m gay. The story is about thetimes I’m not. I told my mother when I was 18. I spent a few weeksliving out of my car afterwards and my college library before shefound me and asked me to come home. We haven’t talked about it.My father made a disparaging comment about a gay celebrityand I told him. He said God was disappointed in my choices and wehaven’t talked about it.The deafening silence doesn’t apply only to the friend I’ve beendating for three years or my rainbow bumper sticker. It gets thesame conversational traction as my father’s decade of secret alco-holism, the bruises he left under my hair the night before he wentinto treatment, the scars on my left forearm, the night I emptiedevery pill bottle in the bathroom, and my grandmother’s decliningmental health.Personal narrative 2. . .How do I measure the force of how my father, uh, hugged mewhile in tears when he found out that I was not straight and that myexistence was not enough to justify their journey to the West?How do I measure the speed at which I broke my parents’ heartand put that into a quantifiable mass that is meant to be carried by ahyphen? Is there a way to measure the immense burden that comeswith hyphenated identities? If an ant is strong how strong am I andhow long have I been strong because I’ve been living under theweight of these hyphenated identities all of my life and I am tiredof being strong.Personal narrative 3. . . . And it’s like all of these—all of these labels that they throw atyou—but they never really want to talk about and learn aboutthings like Asperger’s and things like non-gender binary peo-ple—that they just want to put these labels on you and say all thesethings but never really learn about it and never really learn that,you know, these are humans that they’re talking to, not just a word,not just a label, not just a sticker they can stick up.Personal narrative 4Um, everything I wrote is very disjointed, which I guess is part ofthe struggle in trying to tell a story—and one that’s been the—hasbeen my whole life. Um, I’m trying to decide which part to start on.I’ll just start kind of chronologically. So I was born in [city, state],and I lived there until I was seven. And a lot of my family livesin—extended family—lives in [state]. And it’s—extended familyis very important to us as southerners and just us—our individualfamily; and so I spent a lot of time going back and forth visiting myextended family. And then in second grade—just before secondgrade—we moved to [state] for my dad’s job, and that was a big,fun adventure to me. And I remember—I was there until I was 12and I have a few different memories that I guess one could under-stand as being kind of queer or gender events like trying to demandwhen I was playing with my friends that I was going to be the dadwhen we were playing house, like, “I’m going to be the dad,” andmy other friend was like, “I want to be the dad.And there was another time that one of them—my best friendwas like, “You know how me and you just kind of like play pre-tend,”—and we’d pretend we’re lesbians sometimes, “Well, likeare you a lesbian because it seems like you like it.” And I was like,“No, I like boys. It doesn’t—I can’t be a lesbian.” Like, it didn’t—Ididn’t know about in between-ness, and that like bisexuality orpansexuality was an option. And I had been attracted to boys anddated them since middle school and so for a long time I didn’t thinkthat was really an option for me. I thought like, “Well, it’s con-firmed. I’m straight and I guess I’m cis because I can just be atomboy,” and that’s—I didn’t know the word cis or trans—I knewabout sex changes. Once I remember I was talking to one of mybest friends and I said—and I had just learned about sex changesand I said, “I’d do that.” And everyone was like, “What? Youwould?” “I’d do that. Sure.\"The personal narratives were followed by group reflection andresponses. Participants focused on areas of convergence anddivergence in their stories and the way that the process oftelling and hearing the narratives made them feel.8 International Journal of Qualitative MethodsReflection and Sharing Beyond the Study SpaceThe sixth and final component of the design was a collectivereflection on the counterstorytelling study overall, whichincluded both the space and the curricular components. Parti-cipants were asked to identify the value of such a process, ifany, in other contexts, as well as any interest they had in takinginitiative to extend the story sharing process beyond the con-fines of the study, as is often reflected in studies with a parti-cipatory methodology. Participants identified individual-levelbenefits to engaging in counterstorytelling as well ascommunity-level benefits. For some, the therapeutic value ofsharing a space with other LGBTQ-identified young peoplewas identified as valuable. This sentiment aligns with one ofthe guiding principles identified by the researchers. The fol-lowing quote from a participant illustrates this point.I felt safe to open up in here and like to—like, in feelings, you know.I felt safe to feel feelings just because I know that this was a safespace, you know. And I think that in other settings when I try andshare, like, a personal story, I’m just kind of worried that thelisteners won’t see the value in the story just ‘cause they’re notpart of one of the oppressed groups that I’m talking about. So thatcreates a lot of anxiety. Like, okay, I’m sharing this personal thing,but, like you’re part of the majority group. So do you understandhow I feel? And even if you don’t, are you empathizing? Like, whatdoes this mean for you, you know?For others, the potential power of making visible stories andexperiences that are invisible was identified as valuable. Thelatter was seen as a source of power that the participants had touse their stories to impact others. A small group of participantsdecided to voluntarily work together to share their own storieswith others who may benefit from hearing them after the studyhad ended.DiscussionCounterstorytelling is a qualitative research methodology thatderives from critical race theory and is used to give voice togroups who are not often heard. Solo´rzano and Yosso (2002)state that critical race theory “challenges the traditional claimsthat educational institutions make toward objectivity, meritoc-racy, colorblindness, race neutrality, and equal opportunity”(p. 472). It is through this means of challenging dominantideology that counterstorytelling aims to validate all livedexperiences through empowering the respondents to becomethe authors. It aims to develop an inclusive narrative that buildson the power of the story to increase resiliency and sway socialjustice movements. In essence, counterstorytelling uses thepower of narrative as a form of resistance.Value of CounterstorytellingThrough the design and implementation of this study, theresearchers identified ways that counterstorytelling has valueas a research methodology with LGBTQ youth, as well as othergroups or populations of youth who face marginalization andstigmatization. These were shared with a group of participantsas a form of member checking almost 1 year after the study hadbeen completed. The participants gave feedback, which isincorporated into the aspects described in the following.First, counterstorytelling creates an opportunity withinresearch to support self-definition among participants. Thisprocess can be particularly important in cases where traditionalresearch methods have a reductionist lens that minimize thebreadth of experiences and complexity of intersecting identitieswithin a population. Similarly, counterstorytelling allows forcontextualized representation. For example, the group who par-ticipated in this study identified specific narratives that existabout LGBTQ young people in the United States as well asthose that are specific to the southern United StatesAnother value that counterstorytelling holds as a researchmethodology as it was carried out in this study was the identi-fication and collective analysis of dominant narrative(s) andtheir impact on the population. By making these narrativesvisible, the participants were able to deconstruct their meaning,contradictions that exist within them, and the emotional tollthat they take on young people. Dominant narratives are oftentaken for granted assumptions that go unquestioned. By inten-tionally bringing them to the forefront and naming them, parti-cipants were better equipped to counter them with their ownnarratives, rather than devaluing their personal experiencesbecause they did not fit the dominant narratives.Another benefit of this research methodology, particularlyfor groups of young people who face marginalization, is theprolonged engagement between researchers and participants.Based on the feedback from the young people who participatedin this study, both the amount of time that interactions tookplace and the participatory strategies that incorporated theirideas and needs supported relationship building that enhancedauthenticity in the research. There was a sense of empower-ment that was expressed by the participants who resulted froman ability to reclaim one’s story and identity, as well as from aconnection and identification with others. Even in cases wherethe stories differed drastically, the process of telling one’s storyin a space that was created to honor and value it was mean-ingful. In this sense, counterstorytelling as a research metho-dology that supports resistance may hold transformationalvalue at the individual, collective, and community levels. Suchvalue should be explored further in future research.Finally, counterstorytelling—as it was implemented in thisstudy—allows for the generation of multiple forms of data. Inthis study, data were generated by the participants in the formof dominant narrative messages, counterstories, personal nar-ratives, and journal reflections. These data were both visual andtextual. In addition, the study generated data from the reflectivedialogue about the previously described data sources. Thesevarious data sources and perspectives allow for the counter-storytelling methodology to be used to answer a number ofkinds of qualitative research questions and to use various formsof data analysis. For example, thematic analysis of the narrativedata could be used to identify themes and concepts that emergeWagaman et al. 9in the data, or narrative analysis could be used to explore theways in which participants develop and deliver their narratives,either in relationship to or distinct from the dominant narrativesand messages.Challenges in Implementing Counterstorytellingas a Research MethodologyThrough the development and implementation of this counter-storytelling study with LGBTQ young people, the researchersfaced a number of challenges, a few of which are presentedhere as opportunities for learning. The first challenge was expe-rienced in the recruitment and participant selection process. Inthe community context within which the researchers were aim-ing to recruit a diverse group of participants, it became appar-ent that race and class divisions with regard to access toLGBTQ programs would create a barrier to recruiting specificsubpopulations. This is a common challenge to conductingresearch, particularly with LGBTQ people of color (DeBlaere,Brewster, Sarkees, & Moradi, 2010). Both researchers werenew to the community and were limited in terms of relation-ships and established trust in groups that had traditionally expe-rienced marginalization. In future applications of this researchmethod, the researchers would encourage teams to consider therepresentation of the researchers involved and aim to reflectgroups who they hope will be involved in the study to the extentpossible. When/if this is not possible, the time line for recruit-ment should factor in a need for community-based relationshipbuilding that supports the researchers’ ability to gain entranceto these harder to reach subpopulations.A second challenge that was unanticipated by the researcherswas the balance of roles with regard to maintaining accountabil-ity for the space based on the established norms. In the begin-ning, the researchers took on the primary role of normaccountability that hindered the group’s ability to establish own-ership and learn how to hold one another accountable. Once theresearchers reflected on the notion that “safety” in the spacewould require the entire group to be engaged in the process ofreflection and adaptation of norms, then the researchers felt morecomfortable stepping back to make space for participants to stepforward into this role, which was more effective.A third challenge that the researchers faced in the implemen-tation of this study was the balance of attending to both theprocess and the product. As the attention to the space and projectdesign was iterative, time management and planning were notstatic but in flux. At times, this created challenges to our abilityto plan for how long aspects of the research design would take.For example, the caucus groups took longer than expected,which pushed the personal narrative development into the fol-lowing week’s session. In the future, researchers should plan toattend to the unexpected and build in time to do so.ConclusionBased on the experience of designing and implementing acounterstorytelling research study with LGBTQ young people,this method holds value for other groups of marginalized youngpeople whose experiences often are unvoiced in the researchliterature. As described, attention must be paid to the designand process that support sensitivity and participation amongthose involved. Counterstorytelling holds potential as aresearch method that supports empowerment of participantsand authenticity of the data collected.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect tothe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.FundingThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-ship, and/or publication of this article.ORCID iDM.
