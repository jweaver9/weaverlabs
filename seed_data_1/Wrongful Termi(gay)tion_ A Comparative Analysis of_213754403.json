Yet today in America, in the majority of states,LGBT[Q+] Americans live without the protection of fully-in-clusive non-discrimination laws.  I believe America is ready totake the next steps forward in the march for fairness, equal-ity, and opportunity for every American.  It is time to takebold legislative action.1- U.S. Senator Tammy BaldwinAlthough the United States has made great strides towardequality for its LGBTQ+ citizens in recent years, South Africahas demonstrated far greater progress concerning equal pro-tection and employment non-discrimination of its LGBTQ+ citi-zens.  The South African Constitution, for example, expresslyprohibits all unfair discrimination on the basis of sex, gender,or sexual orientation, whether the government or a privateparty committed it.  In December 2005—a whole decade beforeObergefell v. Hodges2—the South African Constitutional Courthanded down Minister of Home Affairs v. Fourie, a landmarkdecision that legalized marriage equality.3  Moreover, unlikethe United States, South Africa has federal laws that prohibitemployment discrimination against its LGBTQ+ citizens andprovide them with robust workplace protections.This Note contends that employment non-discriminationlaws and workplace protections for LGBTQ+ citizens in theUnited States are woefully inadequate.  Although some states1 Press Release, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, Historic ComprehensiveLGBT Non-Discrimination Legislation Re-Introduced in Congress (May 2, 2017),https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/equality-act-2017 [https://perma.cc/X8UR-ASW5].2 135 S.

Thus,this Note further contends that the U.S.’ lawmakers and policy-makers should look to South Africa as a model for implement-ing federal laws that prohibit employment discriminationagainst LGBTQ+ citizens and provide substantial workplaceprotections.6Although it is unlikely that the U.S. Constitution will beamended to join the South African Constitution in prohibitingdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or genderidentity,7 there are other avenues to provide equally robustworkplace protections for LGBTQ+ individuals.  Perhaps themost promising avenue is federal legislation that mirrors SouthAfrican laws.8  Indeed, members of Congress have proposedpieces of legislation that would effectuate significant progressin this area of the law.9  But not all of the proposed pieces of4 See infra subpart II.A.5 Obergefell, 135 S. Ct. at 2608.6 Other commentators have also advocated that the United States’lawmakers and policymakers should look to South Africa as a model for protect-ing the rights of LGBTQ+ citizens.  See, e.g., Eric C. Christiansen, Exporting SouthAfrica’s Social Rights Jurisprudence, 5 LOY. U. CHI. INT’L L. REV. 29, 41 (2007)(“[The South African social rights jurisprudence model] is exportable to othernations seeking to enforce enumerated socio-economic rights because South Af-rica has created its affirmative social rights jurisprudence that internalizes coun-try-specific justiciability concerns.”); Lisa Newstrom, Note, The Horizon of Rights:Lessons from South Africa for the Post-Goodridge Analysis of Same-Sex Marriage,40 CORNELL INT’L L.J. 781, 803–04 (2007) (“Until American judges and lawmakersare willing to learn from Fourie’s analysis by adapting and improving upon it . . .the balance will remain skewed against same-sex families before the doors to thecourtroom even open.”).7 Cf. Rick Jervis, Voices: Constitutional Convention an Unlikely Reality, USATODAY (Jan. 26, 2016, 12:17 PM), https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2016/01/26/voices-constitutional-convention-greg-abbott/78849240/[https://perma.cc/AU84-BWKA] (“It’s hard to imagine 34 states deciding on anyone thing.

TheEquality Act, rather than the Employment Non-DiscriminationAct, is therefore the better piece of proposed legislation toadopt.  In the absence of federal non-discrimination laws andworkplace protections, each state should continue to “serve asa laboratory” and “try novel . . . experiments.”11  Additionally,Fortune 500 companies should continue to lead the way in theprivate sector by providing substantial workplace protectionsto their LGBTQ+ employees.12In Part I, this Note reviews South African non-discrimina-tion and equal-protection law and jurisprudence by discussingthe South African Constitution, landmark Constitutional Courtcases, and significant legislation.  The cornerstone of SouthAfrican non-discrimination and equal-protection law and juris-prudence is the Bill of Rights, which explicitly protectsLGBTQ+ South Africans from discrimination.  The governmenthas reaffirmed the Constitution’s commitment to equal rightsfor LGBTQ+ South Africans through court decisions and acts ofParliament.  This Note argues that South Africa’s progressivenon-discrimination and equal-protection legal regime shouldserve as a model for the United States, which currently lagsbehind much of the Western democratic world.In Part II, this Note assesses the current state of non-dis-crimination and equal-protection law and jurisprudence in theUnited States.  Some states have stringent employment non-discrimination laws and provide robust workplace protectionsto its LGBTQ+ citizens.  But other states have no workplaceprotections for its LGBTQ+ citizens.  And on the federal level,there is no legislation prohibiting employment discriminationbased on sexual orientation or gender identity in the privatesector.10 Cf.

The Equal Employment OpportunityCommission has adopted this approach.  The federal courts,however, have been more reluctant to do so because the Su-preme Court has not expressly decided the issue.  Indeed, theSupreme Court recently denied a petition for writ of certiorariin a case dealing with employment discrimination on the basisof sexual orientation and gender identity.In Part IV, this Note discusses two proposed pieces of fed-eral legislation that address employment discrimination basedon sexual orientation and gender identity.  Although LGBTQ+advocacy organizations and their allies once supported the Em-ployment Non-Discrimination Act, they have since withdrawntheir support for the Act because of its modesty.  The betterpiece of legislation, this Note argues, is the Equality Act.  TheEquality Act extends Title VII’s protections to LGBTQ+ individ-uals and better follows the non-discrimination and equal-pro-tection law and jurisprudence of South Africa.ISOUTH AFRICAN NON-DISCRIMINATION LAW ANDJURISPRUDENCEA. The South African ConstitutionAfter South Africa dismantled its apartheid regime, thecountry adopted a “new and powerful constitution that pro-vide[s] protections for individual rights and remedies for theirviolation.”13  Chapter 2 of the South African Constitution in-cludes the Bill of Rights, which “enshrines the rights of allpeople in [South Africa] and affirms the democratic values ofhuman dignity, equality and freedom.”14  The South AfricanConstitution not only directs the government to “respect” therights enumerated in the Bill of Rights but also to “protect,promote and fulfill” the rights.15  The Bill of Rights extends to“all law” and regulates the government and “all organs of thestate.”16  The Bill of Rights also regulates “natural” and “juris-13 Newstrom, supra note 6, at 786.

Section 9(1) boldly declares,“Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equalprotection and benefit of the law.”19  Section 9(3) further states,“The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectlyagainst anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gen-der, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, col-our, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience,belief, culture, language and birth.”20 Discrimination on thebasis of one of the grounds in Section 9(3) is presumptivelyunconstitutional.21The inclusion of sexual orientation in Section 9(3) of theSouth African Constitution22 was the product of victory over anoppressive and discriminatory apartheid regime.23  Afterapartheid, South Africa began the process of transforming itselfinto a “human rights state.”24  Indeed, upon signing the new17 Id., ch. 2, § 8(2); see also id., ch. 2, §§ 8(2)–(3) (explaining when a court willapply the Bill of Rights to regulate a natural or juristic person and what factorsthe court will consider).18 Id., ch. 2, §§ 39(1)–(2).  The South African Constitution discusses the“spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights” throughout its text.  For example,in Chapter 1, the Constitution notes that South Africa is founded on the values ofhuman dignity, equality, human rights, and freedom, among others. See id., ch.1, § 1.  The Preamble includes a similar discussion. See id. at pmbl.19 Id., ch. 2, § 9(1) (emphasis added).20 Id., ch. 2, § 9(3) (emphasis added).21 See id., ch. 2, § 9(5) (“Discrimination on one or more of the grounds listedin subsection (3) is unfair unless it is established that the discrimination is fair.”).22 Hereinafter referred to as the “Equality Clause.”23 See Eric C.

In the early1990s, the European Court of Human Rights twice affirmed itsDudgeon v. United Kingdom34 decision holding that Section 11of the United Kingdom’s law criminalizing homosexual acts vio-lated Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.35Similarly, the United Nations Human Rights Commission con-demned the Australian state of Tasmania for criminalizing ho-29 Substantive Equality and Sexual Orientation, supra note 26, at 585.

Section 16 of Chapter 2 of theSouth African Constitution establishes the right of freedom ofexpression.50  Subsection 2 of Section 16 excepts certain actsof expression from constitutional protection.51  The exceptionsinclude: war propaganda, incitement of imminent violence, andhate speech based on protected grounds that incites harm.52While the hate speech exception renders hate speech based onrace, ethnicity, gender, or religion unprotected expression, itdoes not explicitly do so for sexual orientation.5343 See Jacklyn Cock, Engendering Gay and Lesbian Rights: The EqualityClause in the South African Constitution, 26 WOMEN’S STUD.

Nonetheless, the United States can look to the SouthAfrican Constitution as a model for enacting robust legal pro-tections for LGBTQ+ citizens.B.

The United States—whether through legislation or judicial decisions—should fol-low South Africa’s example.Although South African courts routinely invoke the SouthAfrican Constitution to enforce equal protection and equal dig-nity, problems still persist for many.  While attitudes in SouthAfrica are improving, studies show overwhelming opposition tohomosexual conduct.64  The level of opposition to homosexual-ity in South Africa also far exceeds the level of opposition innations with similar legal protections.65  And LGBTQ+ individ-uals still face discrimination and violence from private actors.66Indeed, in 2014, Minister of Justice Jeff Radebe noted, “Not-withstanding the comprehensive constitutional and legalframework and protection for LGBT[Q+] persons, we have sadlywitnessed acts of discrimination and violent attacks being per-petrated against LGBT[Q+] persons.”67  The problems are am-plified for LGBTQ+ individuals who are poor, Black, orfemale.68  For example, the practice of “corrective rape,” whichis used primarily but not exclusively against Black lesbians,entails sexually assaulting LGBTQ+ individuals to “cure” them63 See, e.g., Nat’l Coal. for Gay & Lesbian Equal. 1999 (1) SA 6 (CC) at para. 28(S.

(“[T]he common-law crime of sodomy [in addition to an infringement of theright to equality] also constitutes an infringement of the right to dignity which isenshrined in section 10 of our Constitution.”).

Fourie, the ConstitutionalCourt of South Africa unanimously invalidated the common-law definition of marriage and struck down a section of theMarriage Act.128  The Court held that denying same-sexcouples the same status and benefits of marriage that the gov-ernment affords to opposite-sex couples violated the Bill ofRights of the South African Constitution.129The Marriage Act governs the formation of marriages andthe procedures of marriage ceremonies.130  Although the Actdoes not specifically stipulate that a marriage is only betweenone man and one woman, some courts interpreted the Act tomean exactly that.131  Additionally, according to the South Afri-can common law, which developed from Roman-Dutch law,marriage is the “union of one man with one woman, to theexclusion . . . of all others.”132  In 2002, Marie Fourie and herpartner, Cecelia Bonthuys, filed a constitutional challenge inthe High Court to the limitation of marriage to one man and onewoman.133  Fourie and Bonthuys had been in a relationship formore than ten years and wished to get married and obtain legalrecognition as spouses.134  They argued that excluding homo-sexual couples from civil marriages and legal recognition asspouses violated the Equality Clause of the South African Con-stitution by unfairly discriminating based on sexual orienta-tion.135  The High Court disagreed and refused to invalidate theexclusion of homosexual couples from marriage.136On appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeal reversed the HighCourt’s decision.137  The Supreme Court unanimously foundthat excluding homosexual couples from marriage unfairly dis-criminated based on sexual orientation and the majority opin-ion interpreted the common-law definition of marriage toinclude homosexual couples.138  The majority opinion, how-128 2006 (1) SA 524 (CC) at paras. 118, 120 (S.

South African Non-Discrimination Laws1. The Employment Equity ActIn 1998, the South African Parliament enacted the Em-ployment Equity Act (EEA) pursuant to the mandate set forthin Section 9(4) of the Bill of Rights.154  The EEA specificallyforbids discrimination in the employment context and seeks tocorrect the disparities, disadvantages, and discriminationcaused by apartheid.155  The purpose of the EEA is to attainemployment equity by “promoting equal opportunity and fairtreatment in employment through the elimination of unfair dis-crimination” and “implementing affirmative[-]action measuresto redress the disadvantages in employment experienced bydesignated groups.”156  To fulfill this purpose, the EEA requiresthat every employer update their employment policies andpractices to eliminate any unfair discrimination on the enu-merated protected grounds.157  The EEA includes both genderand sexual orientation as protected grounds on the basis of150 Gay Marriage Around the World, PEW RES.

The Promotion of Equality and Prevention of UnfairDiscrimination ActLike the EEA, Parliament passed the Promotion of Equalityand Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (PEPUDA) pursu-ant to Section 9(4) of the Bill of Rights.164  The PEPUDA seeksto eliminate “deeply embedded” “social and economic inequali-ties” and unfair discrimination remaining from “colonialism,apartheid and patriarchy.”165  To achieve its end, the PEPUDAprohibits unfair discrimination, harassment, and hate speechbased on the enumerated protected grounds.166  Like Section 9of the Bill of Rights, the PEPUDA includes gender and sexualorientation as protected grounds.167  Although the PEPUDAspecifically highlights race, gender, and disability throughoutits text, the Act does not differentiate between the enumerated158 Id. § 6(1).159 Id. § 6(3).160 Id. § 13(1).161 Id. § 15(1).162 Id. § 13(2); see also id. §§ 16, 19–21 (further elaborating on the steps enu-merated in § 13(2)).163 Id. ch. 4.164 Saras Jagwanth, Affirmative Action in a Transformative Context: The SouthAfrican Experience, 36 CONN.

In the CourtsThe federal courts’ findings that Title VII bans employmentdiscrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orienta-tion have generally cited two Supreme Court cases for support.In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court held thatemployment discrimination on the basis of gender stereotypingis unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII.224  The case in-volved a female senior manager, Ann Hopkins, at a nationwideprofessional accounting firm.225  Some of the partners in heroffice recommended Hopkins for partnership candidacy.226The process of selecting new partners entailed the firm solicit-ing written comments about each partnership candidate.227The partners ultimately decided not to admit Hopkins to thepartnership, but rather to “hold” her for reconsideration thenext year.228  Some of the comments indicated that she was too“aggressive,” “harsh,” “difficult to work with,” “impatient,” and“macho.”229  One partner even remarked that she needed “acourse at charm school.”230  Additionally, Hopkins was told to“walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femi-ninely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry”to improve her partnership admission prospects.231  As a resultof this experience, Hopkins alleged that her firm, PriceWaterhouse, violated Title VII by discriminating against herbased on sex.232Just three years prior, the Supreme Court held that sexualharassment constitutes sex discrimination under Title VII.233The Court, quoting City of Los Angeles Department of Water &Power v. Manhart,234 stated that Title VII’s “because of sex”provision includes “the entire spectrum of disparate treatmentof men and women resulting from [gender] stereotypes.”235  TheCourt emphasized its view that “[the United States is] beyondthe day when an employer could evaluate employees by assum-ing or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated224 490 U.S. at 258.225 Id. at 232.226 Id.227 Id.228 Id. at 233.229 Id. at 235.230 Id.231 Id.232 Id. at 232.233 See Meritor Sav.

Thus, Price Waterhouse seemingly “per-mit[s] an enormous range of discrimination claims.”237Nine years later, in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,Inc., the Supreme Court held that same-sex harassment con-stitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII.238  Thecase involved several male coworkers committing “sex-related,humiliating actions” against the petitioner, Joseph Oncale.239The harassment, however, did not stop there; the coworkersalso “physically assaulted Oncale in a sexual manner” andthreatened to rape him.240  Oncale complained to supervisors,but they did nothing.241  Eventually, Oncale quit and requestedthat the documentation show that he “voluntarily left due tosexual harassment and verbal abuse.”242  Justice Scalia, writ-ing for the majority, declared, “Title VII prohibits ‘dis-criminat[ion] . . . because of . . . sex’ . . . . [This] must extend to[sex-based discrimination] of any kind that meets the statutoryrequirements.”243  He reasoned that Title VII prohibits anyworkplace conduct that meets the statutory requirements, in-cluding same-sex sexual harassment.244  But the SupremeCourt has never explicitly addressed the issue of extendingTitle VII protections to LGBTQ+ individuals alleging employ-ment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual236 Id.237 Ian Ayres & Richard Luedeman, Tops, Bottoms, and Versatiles: WhatStraight Views of Penetrative Preferences Could Mean for Sexuality Claims UnderPrice Waterhouse, 123 YALE L.J. 714, 720 (2013); see also I.

Evans and Zarda deal predominantly with extending the“based on sex” provision in Title VII to cover sexual orientation.  But the SupremeCourt also has the opportunity to conclude that “based on sex” also includesdiscrimination based on gender identity, albeit in the context of Title IX. SeeWhitaker v. Kenosha Unified Sch. Dist.

Thus, in order to more closely follow SouthAfrica’s robust and progressive protections for its LGBTQ+ citi-zens, the U.S. Congress should pass the Equality Act.
