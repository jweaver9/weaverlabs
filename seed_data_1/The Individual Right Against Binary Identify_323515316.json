POCHIE   THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST BINARY IDENTITY COLIN POCHIE* INTRODUCTION Identification documents encompass our lives and follow us from birth to death. Birth certificates, driver’s licenses, social security cards, passports—all serve to confirm one’s identity.1 And to do so, each document bears necessary identifying information: name, date of birth, address, citizenship status, signature, and so on.2 Some also carry infor-mation about our physical appearance and gender.3 Most states divide this latter designation between male and female.4 Yet many people do not slot neatly into this identification bi-nary. Gender is necessarily core to an individual’s identity—it shapes the way they interact with others and with the world around them.5 In turn, gender manifests as an expression of self-perception.6 It functions                                                             © 2019 Colin Pochie * Attorney Advisor, Executive Office for Immigration Review, United States Department of Justice; B.A. University of Illinois at Chicago; J.D.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 as a social construct, as well as expression of one’s perception of being a man, woman, or gender-nonconforming person.7 Gender is thus dis-tinct from (although also informed by) sex, which is assigned at birth based in part on physically observable traits.8 Social construct even in-fluences the assignment of sex; for example, doctors often choose inter-sex individuals’ sex for them with invasive surgery.9 Nonbinary, agender, and genderfluid people, meanwhile, do not fall into the male/female binary.10 Instead, much of nonbinary experi-ence is defined either by rejecting binary expression or mixing signals—everything from hair, clothing, speech, gait, and more—which collec-tively align with neither singularly male nor singularly female expres-sion.11 This contrasts with cisgender people, whose gender expression aligns with their sex assigned at birth; it also contrasts with some transgender people, who often adopt the expression most aligned with their gender identity.12 Both nonbinary and transgender people some-times suffer from gender dysphoria as well, which is defined as a con-tinuous incongruence between one’s “expressed/experienced gender and the gender others would assign” one.13 For both nonbinary and transgender people too, rejection of gen-der identity and repression of gender expression harms mental health and self-perception.14 While not present in all instances, this tension may involve significant psychological distress.15 Positive socialization and reinforcement of gender identity alleviates this harm.16 One exam-                                                             7  Id. at 152–54  8  Julie A.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 237 ple is allowing individuals to use restrooms which align with their gen-der identity.17 Another is government documentation that reflects a per-son’s lived gender. According to a.t. Furuya, a nonbinary person who won a gender-change petition in 2017, “[w]henever I go to the bank or a bar or the airport, I get anxious about showing my I.D. . . . this order means I am not on my own anymore—my state recognizes me.”18 Several jurisdictions allow modifications to one’s name and gen-der on government identification.19 This option is helpful for transgender people and allows them to reinforce and live as their expe-rienced gender.20 But what of nonbinary people? Several states and Washington, D.C. now offer a third gender option for government iden-tification.21 Some cities like Chicago will also allow a third gender op-tion on their municipal identification.22 But that leaves out most states, which still force nonbinary people to adhere to binary identification.23 If the First Amendment right not to speak is to mean anything, then state governments cannot force binary expression on nonbinary people.24 Though others have argued for either abolishing binary gender identification or taking a contextual approach, this article addresses the individual rights of nonbinary people and advocates for third-gender identification options.25 Part I of this article thus examines the law of                                                              17  WORLD PROF’L ASS’N FOR TRANSGENDER HEALTH, STANDARDS OF CARE FOR THE HEALTH OF TRANSSEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, AND GENDER NONCONFORMING PEOPLE 1, 68 (7th ed. 2012), https://s3.amazonaws.com/amo_hub_content/Association140/files/Standards%20of%20Care% 20V7%20-%202011%20WPATH%20(2)(1).pdf [hereinafter WPATH STANDARDS]; see Am.

I. THE LAW OF GENDER NONCONFORMITY Gender reclassification schemes vary from state-to-state.30 Many require some proof of surgery—phalloplasty or vaginoplasty.31 Until January 1, 2019, New York State required a doctor’s letter certi-fying that the applicant identified as transgender or was otherwise gen-der-nonconforming.32 California does not.33 Some states, like Tennes-see, outright forbid gender reclassification.34 Certain federal agencies like the State Department have similar requirements as well.35 Sex itself is subject to its own constructs. Biological determin-ists36 often insist that sex is determined by genitalia—the circumstance                                                             gender markers); see also Anna James (AJ) Neuman Wipfler, Identity Crisis: The Limitations of Expanding Government Recognition of Gender Identity and the Possibility of Genderless Identity Documents, 39 HARV.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 from Klinefelter syndrome—they may possess one or more extra X chromosomes and develop more feminine characteristics than other men.51 Women who suffer from congenital adrenal hyperplasia experi-ence much the same—they develop masculine sexual characteristics, in-cluding masculinized genitals.52 In all these cases, few would accuse them of belonging to a different sex.53 But it also shows the tension be-tween the identity we derive and the moldable characteristics that iden-tity is based upon.54 As discussed above, gender is even more fraught.55 It draws not just from sex characteristics, but also from the value we ascribe to those characteristics.56 The identity that we create depends on the value that we place in those characteristics.57 Nonbinary people, then, construct identity in a way that transgresses traditional gender constructs.58 But that identity also mixes gender norms in ways that do not form a binary whole.59 While little precedent on the status of nonbinary identity exists, a large body has accumulated on gender transgression and how it inter-sects with dignity.60 Though dignity sounds in due process, it has a deep interplay with liberty and other First Amendment principles.61 To un-derstand expressive rights in identity, it is therefore useful to look to dignity jurisprudence.62 A. Cisgender Transgression, Transgender Identity, and Dignity One of the earliest examples of the intersection of gender non-conformity and dignity is Bowers v. Hardwick.63 There, a gay man chal-lenged a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy under which he had been                                                              51  See id.  52  MARGARET M.

Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 241 charged.64 In some sense, that case involved how Hardwick constructed his identity as a gay man; sexual autonomy is an essential part of identity for many.65 Writing for the majority, Justice White characterized the case as demanding a right to sodomy.66 In doing so, he rejected the no-tion that gay people had the same rights as heterosexual people.67 That mischaracterization faced a reckoning in Lawrence v. Texas, which expressly overruled Bowers.68 Under similar facts, the Court held that the liberty interest of dignity protected the sexual rights of gay people.69 But what stands out is how the Court considered the concept of dignity.70 Essential to that right of dignity was the ability for adults to relate to one another and find acceptance.71 Thus, the state can-not “define the meaning of . . . relationship[s] or . . . set [their] bounda-ries . . . . adults may choose to enter upon this relationship . . . and still retain their dignity as free persons.”72 That same articulation of dignity through self-determination found even more support in Obergefell v. Hodges.73 The Court there ex-panded the right to include same-sex marriage.74 Citing First Amend-ment precedent, the Court held that “these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.”75 That the ability to establish relationships is core to autonomy and identity, then, is clear.76 One scholar observed too that equality for LGBT individuals                                                              64  Id. at 187–88.  65  See id. at 187–89.  66  Id. at 190.  67  Id. at 190–91.  68  Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577.  69  Id. at 567.  70  Id.  71  Id.  72  Id.  73  135 S.

[a]bove all, they have a right to live in accord with their own values and identities while being treated as full and equal human beings and citizens.”). POCHIE  242 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 may only come about “when society stop[s] conditioning our inclusion on assimilation to straight norms.”77 The Court has gone as far as recognizing that dignity—and all its attendant self-determinative concerns—may come from state identi-fication schemes.78 In Pavan v. Smith,79 it held that Arkansas could not exclude one of a child’s same-sex parents from that child’s birth certif-icate.80 Because the state allowed non-biological heterosexual parents to be listed, it denied same-sex parents the same dignity of legal recogni-tion by excluding them from birth certificates.81 Indeed, the Court acknowledged that the certificate imparted “legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents,” thus rendering it “more than a mere marker of biological relationships . . . .”82 Though Terrah and Marisa Pavan would have been their child’s legal parents regardless of what the birth certificate said, state recognition of their identities and relationship was still essential to their dignity rights.83 A full-throated recognition of transgender and nonbinary indi-viduals’ dignity rights in the same context has only recently emerged.84 The court in Gonzalez v. Nevares85 held that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico violated transgender individuals’ privacy and autonomy by requiring their birth certificates to bear any struck-out information after legally changing their names or gender designations.86 Just as the Court in Pavan acknowledged that excluding identity-affirming information from a legal document violated autonomy and dignity, the Gonzalez court acknowledged that including identity-contradicting information does the same.87 Though resolved on privacy grounds, the decision shows how “speech and identity are often intimately linked” and how the former helps “construct queer identities and gender norms.”88 It should come as little surprise then that nonbinary individuals have pushed for similar recognition in recent years.89                                                              77  See YOSHINO, supra note 6, at 21.  78  See Pavan v.

Furuya, a nonbinary individual, successfully argued for gender reclassification to nonbinary.91 Furuya argued that they had lived as a nonbinary person for over half their life, but still “regularly face[d] harassment and challenges because of the perceived incongruence be-tween [their] gender nonconforming appearance and their stereotypi-cally feminine name and female gender marker on their government-issued identification documents.”92 In a given example, Furuya detailed how they had to explain their situation when conducting business at their bank because their identification did not reflect their appearance.93 Furuya argued that the First Amendment protected them from binary identification and described the binary requirement as state-com-pelled speech.94 At the core of this assertion was that Furuya’s construc-tion of identity inherently rejected binary gender.95 To force them to ac-cept it would be to violate the values that the First Amendment protects—it would compel them to speak.96 The court ultimately granted a.t.’s request without ruling on the merits of their First Amendment ar-gument, however.97 Other courts faced with similar claims have fol-lowed suit.98 Dana Zzyym’s struggle against the State Department’s binary-gender rules, meanwhile, has received significant attention over recent years.99 Yet the court in Zzyym v. Pompeo also resolved the dispute un-der the Administrative Procedure Act and left Zzyym’s liberty claims unanswered.100 The Department there had denied Zzyym—an intersex                                                              90  See infra Part I-B.  91  Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Petition for Change of Name and Gender at 2, In re a.t.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 person—a nonbinary designation on their passport, and instead insisted that they choose either a male or female designation.101 Because Zzyym refused, the Department denied their passport; at the time, Zzyym com-mented that it was “a painful hypocrisy that, simply because I refused to lie about my gender on a government document, that the government would ignore who I am.”102 The Department gave several justifications for the policy, each less successful than the last.103 As the court found, three justifications—that the Department needs consistent sex data to ensure passport accu-racy, to determine passport eligibility, and to verify a passport-holder’s identity—all boiled down to the same purported need to cross-check gender with other identity systems.104 The court rejected all three in part because the Department already had identity-verification procedures that either worked independent of sex data from states and other federal agencies or disregarded sex data entirely.105 What’s more, the Interna-tional Civil Aviation Organization—the same organization that origi-nally recommended binary gender markers on passports—now recom-mends nonbinary gender markers for passports.106 The Department’s other claim that there is no medical consensus recognizing a third sex also fell because its relied-upon medical authority does recognize non-binary genders.107 The Zzyym court also rejected an argument often raised against nonbinary identification markers: that the time and cost of implement-ing a system to recognize a third gender classification would be unduly burdensome to state and federal agencies.108 According to the Depart-ment, “it would take considerable time and resources for the Depart-ment . . . to alter their systems to add a third sex designation.”109 It made no effort to calculate what those costs might be, choosing instead to rely on the suggestion of cost alone to carry its argument.110 While acknowl-edging that some cost was necessarily implicated, the Court rejected this                                                              101  Id. at 1251–52.  102  Victory for Intersex Client!, LAMBDA LEGAL (Nov. 22, 2016), https://www.lambdale-gal.org/blog/20161122_zzyym.  103  Zzyym, 341 F.

THE LAW OF COMPELLED SPEECH The First Amendment prohibits the federal and state govern-ments from “abridging the freedom of speech.”116 The values of auton-omy, mutual recognition, and dignity are all enshrined within the First Amendment.117 As one scholar puts it, “respect for individual integrity and autonomy requires the recognition that a person has the right to use speech to develop herself.”118 Autonomy too, reinforces the “authentic-ity” of self—it functions as a mechanism to construct identity.119 Said differently, “if there is a ‘right to be,’ there is a ‘right to say what one is.’”120 A.  Autonomy, Self-Determination, and Expression The Lockean concept of self-determination is inherent in First Amendment values and protections.121 In the state of nature, all people can act as they wish within reason.122 Individualism necessarily exists in nature, but its existence also requires respect of that determination.123                                                              111  Id. at 1259.  112  Id. at 1260–61.  113  Id.; see also In re Furuya, No. 37-2016-00044778-CU-PT-CTL (Cal.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 That autonomy in turn protects individuals from coercion—”a liberal state has no authority to coerce individuals to hold or express particular beliefs. Instead, all the state legitimately can do is to require individuals to act in a way that respects the rights of others.”124 Expression is an essential part of self-determination as well; re-gardless of whether it is for oneself or for others, expressive acts help one define oneself to oneself as well as within society.125 Every individ-ual has veto power over how they use their bodies and minds—and, in turn, how they influence the world around them.126 The First Amend-ment thus functions as an identity-producing mechanism free from gov-ernment interference in most circumstances.127 Any individual’s con-duct “expresses and further defines the actor’s identity and contributes to [their] self-realization.”128 Societal norms, however, can work to discourage unfavored identities.129 Typically, these are enforced not through law but through verbal acts of disapproval, disassociation, and the like.130 Unlike gov-ernmental interference, norms do not themselves interfere with individ-ual rights.131 But the social pressure they produce influences those who make law and policy; problems then arise when the state chooses to en-force those norms.132 Recognition by government and by society is therefore essential to identity and individual liberty—otherwise, the state may “attempt[] to define who a person is,” which “clearly disre-spects individual autonomy.”133 While the First Amendment does not tolerate governmental pro-hibition of otherwise permissible expression, it does permit the govern-ment to place conditions and other restrictions on that expression.134 Time, place, and manner restrictions have long been recognized in law, for example.135 So too entry costs, taxes, and other barriers to entry.136 Even when recognition and accommodation may cost the government—and society, through taxes—extra resources, it may shift that cost onto                                                              124  Id. at 70; see also BAKER, supra note 24, at 56–57.  125  See BAKER, supra note 24, at 53.  126  Id. at 58.  127  Id. at 58–59.  128  Id. at 53.  129  Id. at 81–82.  130  BAKER, supra note 24, at 81–82.  131  Id.  132  Id. at 82.  133  Id. at 81–82.  134  Id. at 75–78.  135  BAKER, supra note 24, at 75–78.  136  Id. POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 247 the recognized.137 Thus, instead of forbidding certain identities, the gov-ernment and unfavored groups may compromise by cost-shifting as a price of recognition.138 Similarly, efficiency justifications may not work to abridge un-favored expression.139 They subvert autonomy by presuming a desired end goal that preempts recognition and by defining efficiency relative to that goal.140 Efficiency, therefore, must follow liberty and not precede it; it is relevant only when the state already treats groups as autonomous, moral beings deserving of equal respect and mutual recognition.141 These values underpin the First Amendment’s protection of dissident identities and inform compelled-speech jurisprudence. B. The First Amendment as an Identity-Producing Mechanism The seminal compelled speech case is West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette.142 There, the Court held that the state board of education violated the First Amendment by requiring students to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance.143 The salute was violative enough by itself—as a discrete expression, it “comp[elled] students to declare a belief.”144 The Court held that First Amendment protection “does not depend upon whether [government-mandated expression] be good, bad or merely innocuous.”145 Significant too was that the challengers in that case were Jeho-vah’s Witnesses.146 Their challenge rested in part on their belief that the Bible forbids holding graven images—in this case, the flag—above God.147 That belief functions as a core tenet of both faith and identity for Jehovah’s Witnesses.148 The Board thus could not require either “un-willing conver[sion]” or “assent by words without belief and by [] ges-ture barren of meaning.”149 And though the Court decided the broader                                                              137  Id.  138  Id.  139  BAKER, supra note 24, at 84.  140  Id. at 85.  141  Id.  142  319 U.S. 624 (1943).  143  Id. at 625–29, 642.  144  Id. at 631.  145  Id. at 634.  146  Id. at 629.  147  W.

POCHIE  248 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 question of whether any individual could be required to salute the flag, the underlying principle remains the same: “[N]o official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion . . .”150 Whether patriotism or faith, these beliefs contribute to how individuals perceive themselves and exercise autonomy over who they are.151 The Court later reaffirmed this principle in stronger terms in Wooley v. Maynard.152 The Maynards, also Jehovah’s Witnesses, in-sisted on covering the New Hampshire state motto “Live Free or Die” on their license plate.153 They claimed that the motto was “repugnant to their moral, religious, and political beliefs” and that the state thus vio-lated the First Amendment by requiring them to use the plate.154 The Court agreed.155 In doing so, it rejected the state’s arguments that the motto was needed to identify that someone had New Hampshire plates, especially given that the numbers on the plate itself did exactly that.156 This case reinforces the concept that “[t]he right to speak and the right to refrain from speaking are complementary components of the broader concept of ‘individual freedom of mind.’”157 This same principle holds true for direct expressions of iden-tity.158 The Court in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisex-ual Group of Boston faced this question in the context of the 1993 Bos-ton Saint Patrick’s Day Parade.159 Parade organizers there denied members of GLIB—an Irish LGBT advocacy group—permission to march in the parade.160 Recognizing that “[p]arades are . . . a form of expression,” the Court held that compelling GLIB’s involvement would functionally alter the parade’s message.161 This decision in part rested on the parade organizers’ silence as for non-heterosexual elements of Irish identity.162 To make the parade organizers include LGBT marchers                                                              150  Id. at 642.  151  Id. at 641–42; see BAKER, supra note 24, at 53.  152  430 U.S. 705 (1977).  153  Id. at 707–08.  154  Id.  155  Id. at 717.  156  Id. at 716.  157  Wooley, 430 U.S. at 714 (quoting W.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 249 in a decidedly heterosexual expression of Irish identity would violate their right not to speak under the First Amendment.163 Government can compel speech in certain limited circum-stances, however.164 Take Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institu-tional Rights, Inc. for example.165 The Court there held that conditioning federal funding to law schools on allowing military recruiters on campus did not violate the First Amendment.166 FAIR, an association of law schools, sought an injunction against the condition because they op-posed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy.167 But as for speech, the Court found “that there was little likelihood that the views of [the military] would be identified with the [law schools], who re-mained free to disassociate [themselves] from those views . . .”168 Unlike the parade in Hurley, the Court found that the mere act of allowing speakers access to facilities is not itself expressive.169 Autonomy and self-realization necessarily require another ele-ment: recognition.170 Mutual recognition “requires a concern for peo-ple’s liberty . . . for restrictions on liberty disrespect a person’s auton-omy as a moral agent.”171 In turn, rejection of one’s identity counters the autonomy principles central to First Amendment freedoms.172 Accord-ing to one scholar, groups have “no authority to act in ways that deny a person’s equality or . . . autonomy.”173 This concept necessarily has lim-its, of course.174 After all, if one’s identity is based on denying the iden-tity of another, that expression is illegitimate.175 Nor does it reflect First Amendment values.176 This concept, according to some scholars, is rooted in Hegelian principles of confrontation and compromise.177 When the identity of two groups conflicts, the only solution that vindicates First Amendment value is for the groups to recognize one another as “free and independent                                                              163  Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574-75.  164  See Rumsfeld v.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 being[s].”178 This in turn reinforces the rule of reason that underpins Locke’s view of autonomy.179 Thus, “[w]ithin the state and the legal or-der that it establishes, everyone has a basic duty to respect the person-hood and rights of others,” even if it means compromising away certain facets of one’s identity.180 The case of Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission reflects this tension between recognition and iden-tity conditioned on the destruction of another’s identity.181 The groups confronting one another there were members of the Christian faith who did not want to serve LGBT individuals because the latter’s existence conflicts with their faith and religious identity.182 But the concept of mu-tual recognition requires compromise—that a person “recognize that it is legitimate for another to embrace a particular identity and way of life, but only insofar as that identity and way of life are consistent with recog-nition of the basic status and rights of all persons.”183 That the pivotal factor in the Court’s decision was a human rights commissioner’s neg-ative comments about Christian history reflects this concept too.184 Mutual recognition explains the outcome in Hurley as well.185 The Court’s decision in part vindicates the autonomy of the parade or-ganizers, but also asks GLIB to recognize the legitimacy of how the or-ganizers constructed their identity.186 Unlike in Masterpiece, GLIB’s ex-clusion did not deny its members’ identities—they were free to hold their own parade in celebration of their identities.187 In Masterpiece, on the other hand, one group would deprive the other of access to public accommodations to a degree that threatens their existence.188 C. Government Speech The Court has held before that “[w]hen government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of                                                              178  Id.; see also BAKER, supra note 24, at 47–48 (observing that individual liberty requires that, in clashes of individual agents, each party must treat one another as autonomous agents).  179  Heyman, supra note 76, at 61; see also LOCKE, supra note 121, at 269, 309.  180  Heyman, supra note 76, at 63.  181  Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v.

Texas Div. Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. demonstrates the problem.194 There, the Sons of Confederate Veter-ans—a private nonprofit group that espouses the cause of the American Confederacy—proposed a specialty Texas license plate design featuring the Confederate battle flag.195 The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles denied the license-plate proposal outright; it did the same for the group’s second identical proposal after a comment period yielded overwhelm-ingly negative public commentary.196 After the second denial, the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles and alleged that the denial violated the group’s First Amendment rights.197 The Court held that the license plates were government speech.198 So how does this square with Wooley?199 For one, the govern-ment in Walker did not try to make the group speak a message it disa-greed with; instead, it denied the group from making the government espouse a message with which it did not agree.200 The government had                                                              189  Walker v.

City of Shaker Heights.209 There, the city contracted with a private com-pany to sell advertising space on its behalf on the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit System.210 Despite the city’s maintenance of the advertising space, the Court still held that it did not speak through the advertise-ments.211 Instead, because it managed the advertising program to raise revenue, the city did not act as sovereign—it acted as a business man-ager.212 Thus, it could exclude political advertisements that might threaten the image of its business.213                                                              201  Walker, 135 S.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 253 There are still reasonable limits on this relationship, however.214 Self-determinative interest cannot undo the government—the protection of the First Amendment does not extend that far.215 That was the case in Bowen v. Roy when a Native American couple objected to the assign-ment of a Social Security number to their daughter.216 The couple be-lieved that spiritual purity required full autonomy, with no government interference whatsoever.217 But the Court denied this theory; as Chief Justice Burger wrote, “[t]he [First Amendment] simply cannot be un-derstood to require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.”218 As discussed above, autonomy values do not prevent all government interaction with identity—only that which would deny identity com-pletely.219 When government maintains some form of identification—whether license plates, driver’s licenses, or advertisements—part of that role is devoted to raising revenue.220 True, certain identification is used for internal administrative purposes.221 But so too are license plates, as seen in Sons of Confederate Veterans and Wooley.222 The essential in-teraction is that the government acts as an administrator or manager that facilitates speech in some way.223 And when that identification is used to express facets of identity, the government has even less power to dic-tate what form that must take.224                                                              214  See Bowen v.

POCHIE  254 U. MD. L.J. RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 III. THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST BINARY IDENTITY The First Amendment does not demand adherence to the gender binary.225 The rights to dignity, autonomy, and mutual recognition en-shrined in its protections demand the opposite.226 If nonbinary individu-als are to reify their identity, they must have access to the same govern-ment privileges that cisgender and transgender people do.227 States in turn must recognize that they cannot compel nonbinary people to iden-tify with identities that they do not adopt.228 Any accommodation for nonbinary identity on government identification will also likely be of little burden to the government, given cases like Wooley and Sons of Confederate Veterans.229 And even if it is, those administrative costs can be shifted to license holders like with vanity license programs.230 Courts have repeatedly recognized that the First Amendment is a mechanism for constructing identity.231 Every person has a right to assert identity positively as well as to be free from being told who they are or who they must be.232 The oft-cited proposition of West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette is that “[N]o official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.”233 This reflects the well-established principles of Lockean autonomy—the First Amendment guarantees self-determi-nation within reasonable limits.234 Compelled speech, on the other hand, violates self-expressive autonomy in many cases.235 Nonbinary people exemplify that valuation of autonomy.236 Nonbinary identity itself is an amalgam of gender norms, falling into                                                              225  See infra Part III.  226  See BAKER, supra note 24, at 47–48.  227  See WPATH STANDARDS, supra note 17; see also Am.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 255 neither male nor female categorization.237 To force a nonbinary person into either categorization is to ascribe an identity to them that they re-ject.238 The flip side is that nonbinary identity itself is a positive expres-sion of identity—one that adheres to no single gender stereotype, but which spans the normative spectrum to construct the self.239 For a person to self-determine their nonbinary identity also requires a nuanced un-derstanding of gender norms and how society constructs and values gen-der.240 Like the different Irish groups in Hurley, it requires differentiat-ing between different permutations of identity.241 The government can no more demand that the Maynards display “Live Free or Die” on their license plate than it can demand that nonbinary people assume binary gender identity.242 That right to self-determination is essential to living with dignity and equality with others.243 As the Court demonstrated in cases like Lawrence and Obergefell, continued repression infringes on the ability of individuals to associate with one another and to establish their iden-tity.244 Repression may be forced through identification regimes like that in Pavan; yet the Court there acknowledged that dignity lies in state recognition—even through identification schemes.245 And while “[t]he majority would prefer to avoid the expressive activities’ predicted ef-fects on people’s personality and behavior . . .” as in Bowers and Row-land, that paternalist approach must give way to individual rights.246                                                              237  See Monica Hesse, When No Gender Fits: A Quest to Be Seen as Just a Person, WASH.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 Meanwhile, some might argue that passports, driver’s licenses, and the like are government speech.247 After all, the government creates them and assigns them to people.248 And it uses these documents for its own internal administration.249 But as in Lehman, the government acts as an administrator or business manager in issuing identification docu-ments.250 True, it may use these documents for law enforcement pur-poses.251 Though as in Wooley, the value of identification is just as im-portant to the document-holder as it is to the government—handing someone a driver’s license is an expressive act of communicating iden-tity.252 In this respect, the government is just as much an administrator of a revenue-generating identification program as it is a law enforce-ment entity.253 There is also little danger that providing nonbinary markers on documentation would be mistaken for a sponsorship of that identity.254 As in Rumsfeld, the government “remain[s] free to disassociate [itself] from those views.”255 In the case of the federal government, it is also odd to think of that being a concern when the State Department already allows binary gender changes on passports, thus acknowledging the shifting nature of gender.256 Regardless, a third-gender marker would be much like a private ad on public property; as in Lehman, any question of attribution is dispelled by the government’s role as business manager instead of sovereign.257                                                              247  See Walker v.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 257 Naturally, there are practical limits to what nonbinary individu-als can demand.258 As in Bowen, nonbinary individuals can’t demand that any and every permutation of gender non-conforming identity be accommodated.259 To do otherwise would violate the understanding that the First Amendment does not “require the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with the . . . beliefs of partic-ular citizens.”260 On the other hand, the government may avoid violating individual liberty by shifting costs onto license-holders.261 Thus, as in the case of vanity license plates, there is little reason why the government cannot charge additional fees for specialty identi-fication.262 Whatever the cost of altering how identification documents are printed or administering identity checks, that may be placed on the document holder.263 And if applicants are the ones paying for it, there is little immediate cost to the government besides time input. There is also no parallel justification for denying the identification as there was in Sons of Confederate Veterans.264 Unlike in that case, there is no threat of violence or identity deprivation if nonbinary people elect a third gen-der on their identification.265 Though this sort of tax on identity is dis-tasteful, it is not altogether different from the same premiums that van-ity-license-plate owners bear.266 Because binary-gender schemes violate a fundamental right, they should be subject to strict scrutiny.267 On the other hand, some scholars have suggested that hybrid government/private speech calls for intermediate scrutiny.268 Regardless of which level courts employ, bi-nary-gender schemes likely do not pass any level of scrutiny.269 As dis-cussed above, efficiency interests cannot override individual autonomy, especially when cost-shifting is available to offset time and resource                                                              258  See Ruocco, supra note 5, at 196 (“There is not an unlimited, unburdened right to define oneself”).  259  See Bowen v.

RACE, RELIGION, GENDER & CLASS [VOL. 19:2 drain.270 Advancing a particular policy goal is also not a strong enough interest to pass either level of scrutiny when no alternative avenue of nonbinary expression exists.271 States must therefore recognize nonbi-nary individuals or risk litigation losses. In contrast to a recognition model based upon individual rights, some call for the abolition of government-enforced gender identifica-tion; this may be the best route in the long-term.272 Admittedly, there are inherent problems with any identification regime.273 The limits of a third-gender option will not necessarily accommodate all gender per-mutations in the same way that vanity license plate programs accommo-date identity.274 And by enabling recognition, third-gender identification may make it easier for nonbinary people to be targeted for harassment and discrimination.275 But for all that, there is value in seeking third-gender identifica-tion if only as a stopgap measure.276 For one, it will affirm and reinforce the identity of at least some nonbinary individuals; indeed, it seems un-likely that a.t. Furuya and Dana Zzyym would have sought recognition if they did not value it in some way.277 Many transgender people also oppose abolition given the self-actualization benefits of the current identification regime.278 Identity reinforcement may also alleviate asso-ciated distress and heightened rates of self-harm for those who suffer from dysphoria.279                                                              270  See BAKER, supra note 24, at 77–78; see also Corbin, supra note 190, at 681–82 (arguing that lack of threat to government’s role as business manager does not meet intermediate scru-tiny).  271  See Corbin, supra note 190, at 684 (observing that a policy may not pass intermediate scrutiny if the individual affected has no alternative avenue of expression).  272  See Ruocco, supra note 5, at 197; see also Wipfler, supra note 25.  273  See infra text accompanying notes 274–75.  274  See Clarke, supra note 21, at 939–40 (arguing that “it may be impossible to recognize an unlimited variety of identities”).  275  Id. at 940.  276  Id. at 903.  277  See TRANSGENDER L.

POCHIE  2019] THE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AGAINST  BINARY IDENTITY 259 Legal recognition is also one step toward accommodation and integration.280 Like abolition, recognition obviates the need to explain the difference between one’s appearance and the designation on one’s license.281 Though a third-gender option may lead to unintended outing for some, it may also eliminate conflict from identification incongru-ence.282 On the other hand, integration is not necessarily a good thing; freedom from Western conceptions of gender and the liberal state is val-uable in its own right.283 But nonbinary people should regardless be recognized as auton-omous individuals who can choose for themselves whether to support a third-gender identification scheme.284 It gives them the ability to set the terms by which others will recognize them.285 It grants them “. . . per-sonal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including in-timate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.”286 And it allows them to compromise their identity with others in mutual recognition of shared dignity and autonomy.287 These are the freedoms that the First Amendment guarantees.288                                                              280  See Clarke, supra note 21, at 901.  281  Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Petition for Change of Name and Gender, supra note 91, at 7.  282  Identity Documents, LAMBDA LEGAL, https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/arti-cle/trans-identity-documents (last visited Mar. 15, 2020); see NAT’L COALITION OF ANTI-VIOLENCE PROGRAMS, LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, QUEER, AND HIV-AFFECTED HATE VIOLENCE 16 (2017) http://avp.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/NCAVP_2016Hate Violence_REPORT.pdf; see also Ruocco, supra note 5, at 215 (discussing Alexandra Glover’s difficulty changing her driver’s license photo because of state employee’s perception of incon-gruence between her designated gender and appearance); Hayley Gorenberg, Oregon Thinks Outside the (M/F) Box and Becomes First State to Allow Gender Neutral Marker on State IDs, LAMBDA LEGAL (June 15, 2017), https://www.lambdalegal.org/blog/20170615_oregon-gender-neutral-state-id.  283  See Clarke, supra note 21, at 940.  284  See, e.g., LAMBDA LEGAL, supra note 102.  285  See WPATH STANDARDS, supra note 17, at 29–30; see also Am.

So why does the United States lag behind? And if this is the direction that the rest of the world is starting to head in, would it not be prudent to follow their lead—especially when the State Department argues that it needs uniformity to better process pass-ports?295 Perhaps full abolition of gender markers is the best route.296 Or maybe a context-based approach would work better.297 But for now, governments can take an immediate step that will start the path to both legal and societal recognition of nonbinary people.298 What is repressed under the current regime is nonbinary individuals’ “autonomy . . . the freedom to elaborate their authentic selves—rather than . . . a rigid no-tion of what constitutes an authentic . . . identity.”299 The First Amend-ment no more tolerates government-mandated religion than it does gov-ernment-mandated gender.300 States should thus provide nonbinary people access to a third-gender option in government identification schemes.                                                               289  See NAT’L CTR.
