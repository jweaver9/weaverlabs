It is increasingly becoming an expectation for brands to take a stance on such controversies even where they may not be inherently related or relevant to the company’s daily activity. However, the extent to which this form of advocacy has residual effects on the advocating company is still unclear.  This thesis aims to provide clarity on this matter by examining its impact on consumers’ relationship with the company and related perceptions. An online survey was conducted in March 2020. Findings were compared with social analytic research. A correlation analysis suggested a connection between post volume referencing the advocated issue and consumer perception of the company being associated with that issue. Analysis of survey results indicated that perceived fit between organizational identity and advocated issue impacts issue-specific corporate reputation. Findings also suggest perceived fit and perceived authenticity are highly correlated. Perceived fit between organizational identity and advocated social issue are also found to have positive effects on issue-specific reputation. Brand loyalty was similarly predicted by perceived fit and perceived authenticity of corporate social advocacy.   Practical and theoretical implications for research are discussed.      ii    The Impact of Ben & Jerry’s Corporate Social Advocacy on Corporate Reputation and Brand Loyalty     by  Cayley Young   B.A., Syracuse University, 2017     Thesis Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Public Relations.

One study identified corporate social advocacy (CSA hereafter) activities and overall reputation as a dominant influential factor in consumer purchase decisions (Dodd & Supa, 2014). In 2018, another consumer research study found, 75 percent of consumers in the United States claimed they were likely to start shopping at a company that supports an issue they agree with (Clutch, 2019). The study illustrated that a company’s perceived support of an issue and social responsibility were more influential in consumer decision-making than the price of that company’s goods. Further, roughly 59 percent of consumer respondents stated they were likely to stop shopping at a company they perceived to support an issue they disagreed with (Clutch, 2019).   These studies illustrate that corporate reputation and CSA-brand fit is a crucial component to a corporation’s ability to be competitive within its industry. Further, these findings identify corporate identity and reputation in relation to a perceived social issue as a determinative factor in consumer brand loyalty (Park & Jiang, 2020). Consumers prefer to make purchases from companies that are known for supporting issues that are important to them (Clutch, 2019). Consumers are even willing to do so where those goods are at higher price point than competitors (Clutch, 2019). Additionally, a corporation’s reputation and relationship to certain social issues issue are more important to attracting and maintaining a consumer base than its price-points. This thesis will examine the impact of CSA on brand loyalty and corporate reputation. In doing so, this study focuses on the role of perceived CSA-brand fit and CSA authenticity in brand loyalty and corporate reputation.  Fombrun (2012) defines corporate reputation as consisting of a perceptual representation held by all of its constituents that signals the overall attractiveness of the company to employees,  2 consumers, investors, suppliers and local communities. (p.100) A company’s reputation precedes itself and consists of various associations developed from media coverage, word of mouth exchanges and consumers’ transactional experiences. These perceptions create an image of the organization in the minds of its publics. Similarly, corporate identity can be defined as an organization’s strategic choices and its expression of those choices (Abratt & Kleyn, 2012).  A key aspiration of those tasked with managing an organization’s reputation and identity is to effectively craft a positive narrative of the company and maintain control of that narrative throughout the organization’s lifespan. Issue ownership theory focuses on the impact of a specific issue’s salience on the public’s attitude towards competing organizations, as balanced with their already existing reputations in the context of that specific issue. (Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis, 2006). For example, using issue ownership theory, one could accurately predict the outcome of an election based on which issues received the most news coverage at that time (Belanger & Meguid, 2008).  Traditionally, issue ownership theory has been applied in the context of politics and elections. Existing literature fails to adequately address the impact of issue ownership on corporate reputation. More specifically, research fails to examine how a given corporation’s implementation and publicization of its social advocacy efforts impacts that corporation’s reputation and identity as a brand both overall and comparatively within its industry. Through the use of consumer surveys, social listening and an analysis of existing literature this thesis aims to provide insight into whether corporations may cultivate their reputations through the use of corporate social advocacy as a method of issue ownership and agenda setting. The organization of this thesis is as follows; the next chapter will include an in- depth review of existing literature on corporate social responsibility, corporate political advocacy, issue ownership theory, agenda setting theory and corporate identity. The chapter following the  3 literature review will address methodology used to quantify public perception of issues that perceivably fit within the corporate identity and brand loyalty.  A subsequent chapter will address the results and findings from the study. The final chapter will consist of a conclusion that explains the significance of the findings and applies it to the context of corporate identity cultivation through the corporate social advocacy.                     4 Literature Review Corporate Social Advocacy  Corporate social advocacy is a relatively new theoretical body stemming from the intersection of corporate social responsibility and corporate political advocacy frameworks. (Kamasak, James & Yavuz, 2018). Corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) emphasizes the relationship between corporations and society as a whole. (Gaither, Austin & Collins, 2018). A company’s CSR initiatives consist of predetermined efforts to further business-related objectives while also contributing to the betterment of some related societal deficiency regardless of underlying motivation. (Ellen, Webb & Mohr, 2006; Martinez & Rodriguez del Bosque, 2013; Mellahi, Frynas, Sun & Siegal, 2016).  CSR initiatives generally align with the corporation’s business practices (Gaither, Austin & Collins, 2018). Additionally, “initiatives are typically manifested as philanthropy (e.g., cause- related marketing, donations), responsible business practices of the company (e.g., sustainability and employee benefits), and green product attributes (Hydock, Paharia & Weber, 2019, p.78). For example, Dodd & Supa, (2014) distinguished Starbuck’s various conservation efforts such as swapping out straws for lids and use of recycled materials as directly related to the requirements of the company’s day to day business practices.  The behaviors impacted by the CSR initiative are voluntary and are better received where they directly relate to business operations such that they are perceived to “fit” with that brand’s identity (Alhouti, Johnson & Holloway, 2016; Hydock et al., 2019). Alhouti et al (2016) argue that CSR efforts that achieve such a fit are perceived as more authentic and increase company legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders (Alhouti et al, 2016). Companies can achieve an authentic fit where their CSR efforts have a lasting impact. Furthermore, CSR efforts are likely to be  5 perceived as inauthentic where they are perceived to be aimed at compensating for a negative event or to mitigate irresponsible corporate actions. (Alhouti et al, 2016).  Conversely, corporate political advocacy (“CPA”) refers to a corporation’s premeditated interactions with political institutions and political actors in an attempt to induce favorable decision-making and political action. (Kamasak, James & Yavuz, 2018). CPA efforts may include corporate lobbying efforts, appointment of executives with political affiliations, and monetary backing of politicians or political institutions (Hillman, Keim & Schuler, 2004; Den Hond, Rehnbein, De Bakker & Kooijmans-van Lankveld, 2014). A large body of CPA literature concludes CPA on its own may be an effective to improve corporate reputation when implemented in limited amounts. However, CPA may also serve to decrease credibility and stakeholder trust of the implementing corporation.  There is a body of literature that traditionally identified CPA and CSR as unique and unrelated. However, in recent years literature has demonstrated a growing awareness and acceptance of linkages between CPA and CSR (Kamasak, James & Yavuz, 2018; Den Hond et al, 2014). Due to such linkages, Kamasak et al (2018) argue CSR and CPA efforts should be coordinated complementary in order to be most effective in enhancing organizational performance and legitimacy. In determining this coordination, findings from the study suggest that, “firm performance relies on a holistic problem‐solving approach that embraces both corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, the optimum point to leverage the corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities complementarity that leads a firm to superior performance may not necessarily be the point where corporate social responsibility is equal to corporate political activities” (Kamasak et al, 2018, p.315). Therefore, companies will have to take a trial an error approach in determining which combination of CRS and CPA efforts best further their performance and legitimacy.   6 Corporate social advocacy (“CSA”) is referred to as a separate concept comprised of an amalgam of CSR and CPA characteristics but influentially distinct from company CPA and CSR efforts (Gaither et al 2018; Dodd & Supa, 2014). Examples of CSA efforts can be readily found on social media platforms, most prominently, Twitter. The Twitter platform allows companies to easily retweet and share information while taking stances on social issues without devoting extensive time and resources as traditionally required by CSR or CPA efforts. For example, Gaither et al (2018) examined correlated CSA and CPA efforts of Dick’s Sporting Goods in regard to the company’s decisions to discontinue the sale of certain automatic guns in response to major school shootings involving such weapons. The study assessed statements made by Dick’s Sporting Goods executives and references made to the company’s stance via Twitter. Researchers analyzed roughly 10,000 tweets using social analytic software. Their findings established that despite Dick’s Sporting Goods new stance being misaligned with its identity as a pro-gun company involved in weapon sales, over 70% of tweets expressed gratitude with less than 15 percent expressing negative attitudes (Gaither et al., 2018). The study illustrated that, “CSA or CPA serve as a unique opportunity to both bridge and strengthen relationships with some stakeholder groups, while severing ties with others with whom corporate values may no longer align” (Gaither, et al., 2018, p. 194).  Similarly, Dodd & Supa (2014) examined the impact of CSA efforts relating to the issues of gay marriage, emergency contraception and healthcare reform on consumer purchase intention. The study defined purchase intention as, “the potential financial consequences of failing to “connect” with stakeholders” (Dodd & Supa, 2014, p. 15). Findings illustrated that CSA efforts did impact purchase intention. Additionally, such financial implications were stakeholder dependent and may be positive or negative. Although additional research is needed, findings suggest, that where a stakeholder group is supportive of a given stance on a social issue,  7 and a company’s CSA efforts reflect that same stance, that company will connect with that stakeholder group by way of those CSA efforts and thus impact purchase intention of those stakeholders in a way that is financially favorable for the company. Conversely where a stakeholder group is not supportive of a given stance on a social issue, and a company’s CSA efforts reflect that unsupported stance, the company will fail to connect with that stakeholder group and thus impact purchase intention of those stakeholders in a way that is not financially favorable for the company. Further, Korschun et al (2016) suggests that the failure to take a stance on a social issue may have more significant financial impacts for companies than taking a stance unsupported by consumers. A review of CSA literature illustrates there is a gap in research addressing the connection between the company’s CSA efforts and its subsequent impact on brand loyalty (e.g., Park and Jiang, 2020). Research illustrates CSA efforts have an impact on brand loyalty but fail to specify why such impact transpires. This thesis aims to provide a link between company action and consumer action in this context by examining the effect of issue ownership, perceived brand identify-CSA fit, and CSA authenticity on corporate reputation and brand loyalty.  Issue Ownership Theory  A large body of literature examines the application of the issue ownership theory to explain how a political party or a candidate has owned a particular issue, and how that ownership in turn was predictive of election results (Thesen, Green-Pedersen & Mortensen, 2017). However, the theory has rarely been used to explain how a company is perceived to own an issue compared to other rival companies and how this issue ownership has affected corporate reputation. Although issue ownership theory has been predominantly observed in the context of elections, presidential candidates and political debates, it directly connects with corporate  8 reputation and identity. The theory addresses the impact that adequate and inadequate ownership of issues emphasized by the media can have on a corporation’s reputation. It conceptualizes the notion that the impact the salience of a specific issue has on attitudes towards competitor organizations is determined by their pre-established reputations and identities. (Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006; Petrocik, Benoit, & Hansen, 2003). These pre-established identities are issue specific and influence the emotional response and actions of relevant publics. (Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006; Petrocik et al, 2003).  Issue ownership theory in the context of corporations was examined by scholars Heewon Cha, Yeonhee Song, and Jangyul Robert Kim (2010). Their study examined the impact of issue ownership on the reputations of two Korean corporations, Hyundai and SK (Cha et al., 2010).  Their study found that the publics view of corporations that effectively owned issues perceived them as important and that their reputation was higher in comparison to other corporations (Cha, et al., 2010). Their findings complement unpublished research presented by Carroll (2004) that evaluated issue ownership in the context of business news through an examination of articles published by the New York Times.  Similarly, Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006) observed that news regarding an issue perceived by the public to have been handled well by an organization improves that organization’s reputation. Issues successfully handled should be considered effectively owned. Dissimilarly, news coverage of an issue that the public perceives to be incapable of being adequately handled by the organization, will worsen that organization’s reputation. In this situation issues are deemed unowned or poorly owned (Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006). In summary, news coverage of perceivably owned issues faced by an organization will improve that organization’s reputation. Conversely, news coverage of perceivably unowned or poorly owned  9 issues faced by an organization will worsen that organization’s reputation (Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006).  Issue ownership theory and the hypotheses postulated by Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006), and Cha, Song and Kim (2010) closely relate to the concept of corporate associations, that can generally be defined as public’s perception and beliefs regarding a given organization or company (Brown & Dacin, 2002). In 2000, Robert Madrigal proposed the idea that the concept of corporate associations should be viewed as the total set of information a consumer has regarding an organization. This set of information makes up the corporation’s identity. (Madrigal, 2000). Madrigal’s (2000) study evaluated the impact of corporate associations, which comprise corporate identity, on consumer responses to new products. It focused on two kinds of associations, environmental friendliness and corporate excitement. He found that products that consumers felt corresponded with their perceived identity of the corporation were better received than those that did not fit with the corporation’s identity. (Madrigal, 2000). For example, where the public associated the company with having environmental friendliness as a part of its corporate image, environment focused products released by that corporation were received more favorably by the public than where those same products were introduced by a company whose image was not comprised of that association. (Madrigal, 2000). Madrigal’s findings support the belief that a corporation’s image and associations influence its product viability and overall performance in a given industry.  The authority of public perception likely extends to associations related to owned and poorly owned issues as proposed by Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006). Meaning where a given company is associated with a poorly owned issue, products or services introduced that are perceived as associated with that issues may be poorly received. Similarly, where a given  10 company is associated with having successfully owned an issue, products or services introduced that are perceived as aligned with that issue may be well received.  These concepts directly relate to and build off propositions evaluated by Carroll and McCombs (2003). More specifically, Carroll and McCombs (2003) suggested that organizations may impact public perception through media narratives, “the agenda of substantive and affective attributes associated with a firm in business news coverage, especially those attributes specifically linked with a firm, primes the public’s attitude and opinion about the firm” (p. 41-42). Their research further explains that positive coverage of a given attribute of a corporation will result in more positive perception of that attribute by the public, while negative coverage will result in a more negative perception of that attribute (Carroll & McCombs, 2003).  The presentment of an issue to the public in either a negative or positive light, also known as framing, is crucial to effective issue ownership. Effective framing determines whether the public will perceive an issue as having been owned or unowned. Depending on how the issue was framed, subsequent media coverage of the issue will result increase the corporation’s reputation or decrease it, conditional on whether the public perceives the issue as having become a positive or negative association.  For example, Piet Verhoeven (2016) analyzed the importance and intricacies of this exposure. This research examined issue presentation, also known as issue framing, in the context of corporations and journalists, and how that presentation can affect the corporation’s publics (Verhoeven, 2016). Through an analysis of mass media, Verhoeven (2016) found an interdependency between journalists, corporations and their publics. His findings suggested these relationships can be modified by the corporate and media cultures involved. Research further  11 explained that framing can affect audience perceptions and behavior as well as corporate identity and reputation (Verhoeven, 2016).   This thesis examines the impact of CSA efforts on corporate issue ownership. For example, Ben & Jerry’s CSA efforts include tweeting and retweeting posts that support LGBTQ+ rights. This act of sharing indicates the company’s support of the LGBTQ+ social issue. Ben & Jerry’s is often identified as pro-LGBTQ+ brand despite selling a product seemingly unrelated to LGBTQ+ social issues. Through an analysis of public perception and social conversations this thesis explores the extent to which social issues that are the focal point of CSA efforts may be subsequently be perceived to fit within a brand’s corporate identity.    Agenda Setting Theory The agenda setting theory hypothesis was first predominantly advanced by a study conducted by Maxwell McCombs and Donald Shaw in the early 1970s (Coleman, McCombs, Shaw & Weaver, 2009). The theory is rooted in the basic concept that where the media presents specific issues more frequently and dominantly, the public will perceive those issues to be more important than issues not emphasized by news coverage. The theory has maintained relevance and is generally regarded as the one of the “most worth pursuing” mass communication theories. (Blumer & Kavanaugh, 1999, p. 225).   According to May Meijer and Jan Kleinnijenhuis’ (2006) research, agenda setting theory consists of two levels. The first level hypothesis postulates that the more media coverage about a given organization, the higher degree of public awareness of that organization. Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006) conducted a study to test this hypothesis using the oil and gas company, Shell. Their findings indicated that after a period of time in which the company received more  12 media coverage than other companies in the oil industry, respondents considered it to be an important oil company.  Level two of Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis’ agenda setting theory suggested a direct correlation between the amount of media coverage dedicated to a specific issue or attribute of a given organization and the proportion of the public describing the organization in terms of those issues. Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006) again used Shell as a point of analysis for the study, finding that when the company received a large amount of media coverage regarding solar energy, the resulting effect was that respondents began associating the company with solar energy.  Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006) complements research conducted by Bruce K. Berger in 2001. Berger (2001) articulated agenda setting as a metaphor for corporate political advocacy and participation, explaining that “issues appearing on agendas receive attention and are often defined, debated and resolved. Issues that do not appear on agendas are not up for attention and action,” (p. 22). In the context of corporate political participation and advocacy, Berger (2001) found that a corporation’s agenda regarding issues important that corporation, influenced on policy agenda for these issues even where those issues were not salient on the public or media agenda.  He further found that media coverage for these issues coincided with developments on the policy agenda (Berger, 2001). Additionally, outside forces such as public relations campaign messages may have an influence on media tonality and agenda building outside of crisis scenarios. (Cheng, Huang & Chan, 2016).   Ya-Ching Lee (2016) applied concepts promoted by Berger (2001) to the social media context. Lee’s research examined the ability of corporations to build agendas through social media engagement and subsequently influence consumer action in response to issues emphasized by those agendas (2016).  Lee (2016) conducted an analysis of Facebook pages and blogs  13 sourced from various 2014 Fortune 500 companies with initiatives gauged at promoting sustainability and social responsibility. Content was evaluated for mentions of company promoted sustainability initiatives and subsequent related key words (Lee, 2016). Findings illustrated that corporation-created social media content could be used to effectively influence consumers to associate the concept of sustainability with the posting company (Lee, 2016). By giving more attention to sustainability issues via social media posts and blogs, the companies could raise the salience of the issue of sustainability and inspire consumers to act in ways compliant with messages communicated by posts addressing that issue. (Lee, 2016). Where applied to the context of CSA, these findings suggest corporations whose CSA efforts give more attention to specific issues may raise the salience of that issue in the eyes of their publics. For example, as applied to the context of Ben & Jerry’s, the more attention the company places on advocacy efforts to further LGBTQ+ rights, the more salient that issue will become for its publics.  Based on the referenced research, the following hypothesis is postulated:  H1. The social media posts referring to LGBTQ+ issue will be positively associated with the respondents’ top of mind ratings for the top 10 LGBTQ+ companies.   Corporate Identity and Perceived CSA-brand Fit Charles Fombrun (2012) proposed an initial and widely accepted definition for corporate reputation that included three significant aspects. The first was that corporate reputation is based on perception of publics, the second was that reputation is a collective judgment of all stakeholders and the third is that it is comparative, meaning reputation is subjective and relies on a comparison with other relevant organizations. (Fombrun, 2012). Kent Walker expanded this  14 definition to incorporate two additional attributes, one being that a corporation’s reputation can be positive or negative and another being that reputation is stable and enduring (Walker, 2010).   Fombrun extended this definition in 2012 and now generally defines corporate reputation in terms of an organization’s attractiveness to its stakeholders. His definition emphasizes the idea that a corporation’s reputation is founded in the emotional response it elicits from its stakeholders. (Fombrun, 2012). This emotional response consists of how the stakeholders perceive a given corporation’s, “favorability, quality, value, excellence, eminence, distinction or worth” (Fombrun, 2012, p.100-101). Corporate reputation ultimately stems from the prior experiences of stakeholders with the specified corporation as well as their general perceptions and attitudes towards it (Fombrun, 2012).  A significant body of literature indicates corporate reputation is a corporation’s most important intangible asset (Walker, 2010).  Corporate reputation has been directly linked to overall performance and a corporation’s competitive advantage as positive reputation increases likelihood of stakeholder selection of that firm to contract with  (Walker, 2010). However, Walker (2010) explains corporate reputation should not be deemed a term interchangeable with corporate identity. Rather, the two terms refer to different concepts with unique stakeholder groups. More specifically, corporate reputation denotes the perceptions of external stakeholders in regard to their actual conceptualization of the corporation (Gray & Balmer, 1998; Bromley, 2000; Scott & Lane, 2000; Walker, 2010). Conversely, corporate identity refers to internal stakeholders’ perception of what the organization actually is as a whole (Gray & Balmer, 1998; Bromley, 2000; Scott & Lane, 2000; Walker, 2010).  Further, the concept is defined as an organization’s strategic choices and its expression of those choices (Abratt & Kleyn, 2012). Such expression includes brand personality, promise and communication. At the crux of identity formation lies the organization’s values and  15 culture. Values that make up a given organizations corporate identity can be explicitly defined or implicitly suggested through consistent messaging and action. Identity building actions also include the way in which an organization responds to issues and frames its organizational values and operations (Abratt & Kleyn, 2012). Additionally, effective identity formation relies in part on an alignment between an organizations core values and organizational promises (Urde, 2009; Abratt & Kleyn, 2012). The public’s perception of these concepts are therefore indicative of the public’s perception of the organization’s identity and reputation as a whole. Otubanjo (2013) indicates corporate identity can been broken down as addressing  three key notions; who the corporation is, where it’s going and why it’s different. Unlike corporate reputation, corporate identity includes a process of internalization that reputation does not, meaning stakeholders internally identify with a given corporation’s identity (Whetten & Mackey, 2002). Corporations may capitalize on stakeholder alignment with its identity. This means effective management of corporate image and reputation should aim to maintain and complement such alignment with stakeholders (Whetten & Mackey, 2002).  Literature also suggests this stakeholder perception of corporate identity can be molded and influenced by corporate social responsibility efforts (Kiousis, Popescu & Mitrook, 2007; Arendt & Brettel, 2010). Arendt & Brettel (2010) argues that identity building efforts that include strong CSR initiatives have greater influence on public perception of their identity. Additionally, CSR can address issues that align or are misaligned with activities that form corporate identity and reputation (Cardaba, Vilagra & San Roman, 2015).  Literature illustrates CSR efforts that address issues that align, or fit with a given corporations identity tend to be better received by publics and increase consumer loyalty to that corporation (Colleoni, 2013;Martinez & Rodriguez del Bosque, 2013; Cardaba et al, 2015). While low-fit CSR efforts may negatively impact brand perception (Cha, Yi & Bagozzi, 2015). Research further illustrates  16 perceived fit can be enhanced through marketing materials and consumer participation (Cha et al, 2015). Additionally, consumers engaged in active participation with CSR efforts display higher brand loyalty (Cha et al, 2015).   Borden’s (2019) study further suggested that like CSR, CSA efforts organically aligned with an organization’s daily activity strengthens connection between corporations and consumer stakeholders. Similarly, Park & Jiang (2020) found CSA social media messaging served as a signal for corporate identity and effectively generated public interest. Additionally, consumers were able to accept CSA efforts as a signal of corporate identity and decode those signals to identify themselves with that corporation. (Park & Jiang, 2020) The study indicated that message clarity and specificity positively impacted public willingness to engage. (Park & Jiang, 2020). However, literature fails to adequately address whether CSA efforts targeting specific social issues may have similar or corollary implications on an issues’ perceived brand identity-advocacy fit.  This thesis aims to fill this gap through an examination of the impact of Ben & Jerry’s LGBTQ+ CSA efforts on the public’s perception of the brand. Specifically, research provides an analysis as to whether these CSA efforts have caused publics to perceive LGBTQ+ issues as fitting with Ben & Jerry’s corporate identity. This examination and analysis will provide insights as to how and to what extent CSA efforts impact corporate reputation through CSA-brand identity fit.  Additionally, little research has studied how CSA, not CSR, has an impact of on corporate reputation. This means that although Ben & Jerry’s advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, it is unknown whether that advocacy will simultaneously shape and influence its reputation. This thesis aims to fill the gap in literature regarding the impact of CSA on corporate reputation and thus provide answers to this and other corollary questions.  Based on the aforementioned research and in furtherance of the listed goals, the following  17 hypotheses are postulated: H2. Perceived fit between organizational identity and the advocated social issue will have a positive effect on issue-specific corporate reputation.  H3. Perceived favorable stance on the advocated issue will have a positive effect on issue-specific corporate reputation.  CSA Authenticity and Positive Outcomes            A body of literature identifies authenticity as a crucial component for the cultivation of corporate reputation (Alhouti et al., 2016; Fombrun & van Riel, 2004). However as with CPA efforts, CSA efforts may be poorly received by stakeholders. Such a response results in a decrease of credibility and trust for the advocating company (Guimond, 2020; Kim et al., 2019). However, as with CSR efforts, companies may mitigate these risks by ensuring all CSA are authentic (Wettstein & Baur, 2016). Authenticity may be demonstrated where advocacy efforts align with and support the company’s foundational values and is part of a long-term strategy. Therefore, companies should also incorporate messaging reflective of its identity (Wettstein & Baur (2016). Additionally, where companies fail to take steps to ensure authenticity, they may create a legitimacy gap resulting in a decrease in trust and credibility (Heffron, 2019). As suggested above, CSR models often inspire CSA research and CSA findings frequently parallel that of CSR (Guimond, 2020; Kim et al., 2019; Wettstein & Baur, 2016).  In one such instance, Lee, Chang and Lee (2017) applied concepts furthered by Bhattacharya and Sen (2004) in the CSR context to CSA efforts. Findings indicated CSA may be used to strengthen consumer relationships, including the enhancement of future brand loyalty. This thesis examines the extent to which CSA authenticity can elicit positive outcomes, including an assessment of its impact on corporate reputation.  18 Based on the referenced research, the following hypothesis is postulated:  H4: Perceived authenticity will have a positive effect on issue-specific corporate reputation.  Brand Loyalty  Brand loyalty refers to a consumer’s psychological commitment to repurchasing from a given company coupled with the actual act of repurchase (Roy, 2011). Attitudinal brand loyalty focuses on the psychological component. It emphasizes consumers’ positive attitudes and openness to make repeated purchases from the brand (Roy, 2011; Bandyopadhyay & Martell, 2007). While purchase brand loyalty emphasizes consumer action (Roy, 2011; Bandyopadhyay & Martell, 2007). In the context of this thesis, the term brand loyalty should be construed as referring to attitudinal brand loyalty. As Park and Jiang (2020) pointed out, behavioral brand loyalty is a cognitive association that is difficult to adequately observe and accurately measure. Acknowledging this challenge, research was limited to measurements of attitudinal brand loyalty. Park and Jiang (2020) found that corporate identity is positively associated to attitudinal brand loyalty. Their research demonstrated that where a company is perceived as clearly identifying with the social issue being advocated for, consumers’ attitudes and willingness to repurchase from that brand will be impacted (Park & Jiang, 2020). This means consumers may be less willing to repurchase from a company where its corporate identity identifies with issues or stances they disagree with. Conversely, consumers may have more positive attitudes towards and may be more likely to repurchase from companies that they feel identify with stances and issues they agree with.  One example application could be in the context of Ben & Jerry’s. For instance, where  19 consumers perceive LGBTQ+ advocacy as a component of Ben & Jerry’s corporate identity, and those consumers share a similar stance on that issue, Park and Jiang’s (2020) research suggests they would likely have favorable attitudes towards the company and be willing to repurchase. Similarly, where a consumer has a strong anti-LGBTQ+ stance they would have an unfavorable attitude towards Ben & Jerry’s and be unwilling to repurchase. This thesis builds upon existing brand loyalty research by further examining the effects of perceived issue-fit between a company’s identity and the social issue being advocated for on brand loyalty.  Based on the aforementioned research, the following hypothesis is postulated: H5:  Perceived fit between brand identity and the advocated social issue will be positively associated with brand loyalty.  Authenticity Implications for Brand Loyalty Findings from Lee et al (2017) indicate CSA may be used to strengthen consumer relationships, including the enhancement of future brand loyalty. Wettstein and Baur (2016) found that CSR efforts produce more favorable results where they are perceived as authentic, consistent and plausible. Research by Perez (2018) supports these assertions in the context of CSR and indicated authenticity improves company credibility, trustworthiness and brand loyalty. As previously mentioned, much of the current literature on CSA derives from CSR models and recent CSA research implies a correlation between perceived authenticity in CSA and brand loyalty (Lee et al, 2017; Dodd & Supa, 2014). This thesis aims to clarify this connection by assessing it in the CSA context.  Based on these concepts, the following hypothesis is postulated:  H6: Perceived authenticity will have a positive effect on brand loyalty.   20 Methodology This thesis takes a qualitative approach through the utilization of consumer surveys and advanced social listening to determine whether corporations may cultivate their reputations by way of effective issue ownership via corporate social initiatives. The frozen dessert company Ben & Jerry’s will be the focal point of both methodologies employed and subsequent analysis of findings. Ben & Jerry’s is a company infamous for its outspoken support of and advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community. Its corporate website features a timeline of legislation and Supreme Court decisions leading up to the legalization of same-sex marriage. The company even temporarily changed the name of its popular cookie dough ice cream flavor to “I Dough I Dough” in response to the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. Shortly thereafter, the company launched the “Love is Love” campaign to raise awareness for the continued biases against non-heterosexual couples.  It also frequently engages in corporate political advocacy in favor of policies and societal norms that promote members of the LGBTQ+ community.  For these reasons, Ben & Jerry’s was selected as the focal point in measuring and assessing the effectiveness of CSA efforts as a vehicle for establishing corporate identity-fit through organization driven issue ownership and agenda setting. This thesis will use a qualitative and quantitative approach through the use of consumer surveys and content analysis of social media posts to examine these concepts.  21 Company Selection In addition to Ben & Jerry’s, the following nine companies were selected based on their notoriety and involvement with LGBTQ+ issues. A brief description of their involvement and selection is described below.  Tiffany & Co. In 2015, Tiffany & Co. launched its very first jewelry campaign featuring a gay couple (Linshi, 2015). The ad included a proposal and ring set designed for two grooms rather than a bride and groom. The advertisement served as the company’s public endorsement of gay marriage. Since 2015, Tiffany & Co. has launched several other online campaigns featuring same sex couples with hashtag #ThisisTiffany. These campaign efforts demonstrate the company’s robust public support for same-sex marriage and LGBTQ+ issues. A photo of the company’s original 2015 advertisement is included in Appendix A.  Amazon. In 2012, Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos publicly pledged 2.5 million dollars in support of same-sex marriage (Holpuch, 2012). The company also cited support of LGBTQ+ issues as one of the unspoken factors it was taking into account when searching for a new headquarters (O’Connell, 2018). Additionally, on several occasions Bezos has publicly denounced anti-LGBTQ+ policies to the media and articulated his strong support for the LGBTQ+ community through various Amazon diversity initiatives (Gray, 2018).  Apple, Inc. Late CEO of Apple, Steve Jobs, was well known for being a strong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights. In 2008, the company donated 100,000 dollars to fight California’s Proposition 8 which aimed to dismantle same-sex marriage rights (Heisler, 2013). More recently, Apple joined hundreds of other firms and publicly called for the Supreme Court of the United States to recognize LGBTQ+ rights. The company came before the Court in 2019 and called for an end to discriminatory laws and public policies (Henry, 2019). Current CEO, Tim Cook also publicly  22 stated being gay was “a gift from God” in an interview with CNN and identified himself and the company as advocates for LGBTQ+ rights (Laursen, 2018).   Barilla. Barilla is a pasta company that has a unique history with LGBTQ+ advocacy. The brand was formerly known for its homophobic sentiment. In the early 2000’s, its CEO and other top executives made public statements against same-sex marriage and homosexuality in general (Buckley, 2019). Their biggest denunciation occurred in 2013 on an Italian radio talk show. Amid casual discussion with the host, Barilla CEO Claudio Colzani confidently stated he would never allow the company to feature same-sex couples in its advertising and that if consumers disliked his stance they could go purchase another pasta brand (Buckley, 2019). He further clarified he opposed adoptions by same-sex parents. This sparked an international boycott of the brand on social media. Tweets featuring #boycottBarilla and the company’s initial public statement are listed in Appendix A. Harvard also responded by removing all Barilla pasta from its campus dining halls.  Barilla’s competitor Bertolli used the boycott as an opportunity to launch a pro-LGBTQ+ campaign (Boone, 2013).  Following the statement, the company publicly apologized and pledged to remedy their words with advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community.  The company’s biggest step towards LGBTQ+ support was its decision to create an advisory board for diversity and inclusion. The board is headed by civil rights activist, David Mixner who initially boycotted the brand (Buckley, 2019). With the help of Mixner and the new board, in 2018 the company unveiled its first same-sex pasta advertisement (Buckley, 2019). Additionally, the Human Rights Campaign formally announced the company’s turnaround and identified Barilla as an integral ally of the LGBTQ+ community (Wallace, 2014). The GAP, Inc. In 2018 GAP, Inc. publicly declared its stores open to all business. The company viewed this as a significant step in promoting diversity and inclusion for minority populations  23 (Becker, 2018). As part of its Open to All initiative the company pledged to serve all individuals, including those identifying as LGBTQ+, on equal terms (Becker, 2018).  However, a lawsuit was brought against the company in 2019 by an employee for hostile work environment claims stemming from homophobic acts (Wells, 2019). The case is still being litigated. AT&T. Although AT&T has a decade-long history of celebrating pride month, the company’s political contributions surfaced in 2018. The public discovered the company had donated millions of dollars towards anti-LGBTQ+ politicians dedicated to defending the legality of nonvoluntary LGBTQ+ conversion therapy programs (Garza, 2019; Ennis, 2019). As a result, LGBTQ+ activists launched a boycott of the company, resulting in the company being listed as a top offender of civil rights by the Human Rights Campaign (Ennis, 2019). In response to public outcry, AT&T expanded its diversity efforts and launched its #BeBold campaign which promoted inclusivity and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Many LGBTQ+ allies feel these efforts are disingenuous and hope the company continues to be held accountable by its publics (Leonhardt, 2019).     Chick Fil A. In 2018, LGBTQ+ rights activists launched a boycott of Chick Fil A after discovering the company donated millions to anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and organizations. Activists used the #boycottchickfila campaign to discourage LGBTQ+ members and allies from dining at or otherwise engaging with the restaurant chain (Del Valle, 2019). The boycott also drew attention from conservatives supportive of the anti-LGBTQ+ agenda. Many publicly praised the company for its stance. Tweets referencing the boycott are listed in Appendix A.  Although the boycott did not dramatically impact business, the company publicly committed to discontinue donations to anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and organizations (Del Valle, 2019).  Chick Fil A also publicly apologized and announced new diversity and inclusion efforts dedicated to promoting minority populations, including LGBTQ+ individuals (Del Valle, 2019).  24 These announcements were well received by LGBTQ+ activists and viewed as a positive step towards acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community.  However, Chick Fil A’s reputation as anti-LGBTQ+ still lingers with its publics (Del Valle, 2019).  Nike. Nike is well known globally for its diversity efforts. These include initiatives promoting racial diversity, gender equality in the workplace and the general promotion LGBTQ+ rights (Evans, 2016). In 2016, the company launched its BETRUE campaign and corresponding apparel line to encourage acceptance and inclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals (Evans, 2016). In 2019 the company recently published a BETRUE promotional video that included athletes that identify as LGBTQ+ and allies (Ennis, 2019).   Starbucks. Despite being denounced for poor racial diversity efforts, Starbucks has been as consistent supporter of the LGBTQ+ community (Peiper, 2019). As a part of continuing advocacy efforts, in early 2020 the company launched a new pro-LGBTQ+ advertisement. The commercial featured a trans individual continuously being called by his birth name despite having transitioned (Bollingner, 2020). The individual then enters Starbucks where the barista writes his chosen name on his Starbucks cup. The ad was meant to serve as a simple but powerful gesture that the company will accept and include all individuals, including those that identify as LGBTQ+ (Bollinger, 2020). The advertisement was launched on social platforms and coupled with the #whatsyourname. The commercial was met with overwhelming support by the LGBTQ+ community and allies (Bollinger, 2020). It was just one of many LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts launched by Starbucks in the past decade.    25 Content Analysis and Social Listening Sample, Procedure and Measures In order to analyze the ability of corporations to utilize corporate initiatives as a vehicle agenda setting in depth content analysis was employed. Crimson Hexagon was utilized to examine social media posts and online conversation. Online content was evaluated for mentions of a list of ten company names in conjunction with the keywords; “gay,” \"gay rights,\" “homosexual”, “LGBT.” “transgender,” “bisexual,” “sexuality,” \"gender identity\" and \"pride month\".  These words and phrases were selected based on several search iterations and were found to best encompass the concept of LGBTQ+ rights and issues advocacy by corporations. Reliability of keywords was ensured by dozens of sample searches to ensure keyword selections did not encompass search results for unrelated topics.  Companies were selected based on a series of online articles from CNN, Business Insider and LGBTQ Nation for the reasons previously described. Search results included data collected from Crimson Hexagon’s basic source list that generally includes social media platforms such as Twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit, as well as online blogs, pages and forums. News media sources were omitted from one round of search results and included in another. News inclusion and omission are designated as illustrated in Table 1, Appendix B.  Research was conducted in March 2020. All search results were limited to users located within the United States and spanned from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. In order to taken into account differences in market sizes, findings were broken down to percentages. Total posts were divided by total posts mentioning LGBTQ keywords to understand the proportion of posts referencing the topic. Additionally, the method of data collection and tabulation of results were adapted from procedures set forth by Hosch-Dayican, Aarts, Amrit and Dassen (2013).  All findings are provided in Table 1 of Appendix B.  26 Consumer Surveys Sample and Procedure  In order to analyze the impact of corporate initiatives on consumer perception of a given company’s ability to effectively own issues related to those initiatives, a consumer survey was distributed to 550 consumer participants. The survey was created and distributed in March 2020.  Participants were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk service and compensated 0.25 cents for their survey participation. All were asked a series of questions requiring them to rank companies with established corporate initiatives promoting members of the LGBTQ+ community based on the participant’s perception of the company’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights and issues. Companies were selected based on a series of online articles from CNN, Business Insider and LGBTQ Nation and the options listed remained consistent throughout the survey.   In order to guarantee a consistent high quality of participants, pre-screening criteria were established. All participants were selected by and through Amazon MTurk and required to have U.S. residency. Responses were collected and evaluated using Qualtrics analytics service. The survey was also verified for legitimacy during sample testing.   ii. Measures Issue stance. To measure a firm’s issue stance, respondents were asked to indicate what stance they think each of ten brands, which includes Ben & Jerry’s, takes on the issues of LGBTQ+ rights and equality on a 5-point Likert type scale, anchored by “1”=”Strongly oppose” and “5” = “Strongly favor.”  Perceived fit. Perceived fit in this study captured the strength of perceived fit between brand identity and its advocated issue in terms of LGBTQ+ rights and equality. To measure the perceived fit strength, respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement on a seven- 27 point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 7=strongly agree) with the following six statements: (1) The issue is logically related to this type of company (M=4.59, SD=1.57); (2) This advocated message is relevant to consumers of Ben & Jerry's products (M=4.82; SD=1.46); (3) It is very plausible that Ben & Jerry's advocates this issue (M=5.15; SD=1.30); (4) It is typical of this type of company to advocate the issue like this (M = 4.79, SD = 1.48); (5) The advocated message is consistent with the product attributes of the company (M=4.94; SD = 1.43); (6) Overall, the advocated message is a good match with this type of business (M=5.05, SD =1.37). The six items were averaged to create a composite index ( = .90). Corporate reputation. Following a suggestion from Walker (2010), an issue-specific reputation was measured based on the conceptual definition of “positive or negative perception of the firm. [or consider writing as follows] Based on the review of literature (Brown et al., 2006; Walker, 2010), the current research focused on issue-specific reputation. Following Jonkman et al. (Jonkman et al., 2020) and Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006), the issue-specific reputation was measured by asking participants to indicate how they feel toward Ben & Jerry’s stance on LGBTQ+ rights on a 7-point semantic-differential scale with four items (negative/positive, bad/good, unfavorable/favorable, not likable/likable). These four items produced the index of issue-specific reputation with high reliability ( =  .95). Perceived authenticity.  Perceived authenticity measure was adapted from previous CSR research (Alhouti, Johnson, & Holloway, 2016). Participants were asked, when thinking of Ben & Jerry’s, to indicate their degree of agreement with five statements: (1) The company is being true to itself with its LGBTQ+ advocacy (M=5.04, SD=1.25); (2) The company advocates the LGBTQ+ rights in a way that matches its core values (M=5.04, SD=1.26); (3) The company is standing up for what it believes in (M=5.17, SD=1.25); (4) The company's actions and communication are consistent over time (M=5.15, SD= 1.24); (5) The way the company communicates in LGBTQ+  28 rights preserves what the company means to me (M=4.95, SD=1.36). A composite index using these five items turned out to be a highly reliable measure for CSR authenticity  ( =  .92). Brand loyalty. To measure brand loyalty, participants were asked to indicate their agreement on a 7-point Likert scale with the five items adapted from previous studies (Abu Elsamen, 2015; Chaudhuri & Holbrook, 2001; Laroche et al., 2012). The mean and standard deviations for these five items are as follows: (1) I intend to keep purchasing Ben & Jerry's (M = 5.33, SD = 1.47); (2) I will recommend Ben & Jerry's to others (M = 5.14, SD = 1.57); (3) I will try other Ben & Jerry's flavors/products (M = 5.02, SD = 1.58); (4) I am willing to pay more money for Ben & Jerry's than for other competing brands (M = 4.67, SD = 1.74); (5) I consider myself to be loyal to Ben & Jerry's (M = 4.62, SD = 1.77). The composite index for these five items yielded a high reliability coefficient ( =  .92).            Results  29 Findings from the content analysis were compared with data collected from consumer surveys. Explanations for the analytical methods employed and implications on the postulated hypotheses are listed below.  Relevant Demographic Findings. The survey was distributed to approximately 550 participants. Demographic survey questions were included in the survey. The following statistics are included for their relevance in the analysis survey results.  In regard to gender identification, roughly 53.6 percent of respondents identified as male, 43.6 percent female, and 2.8 percent as some other classification. Similarly, over half of respondents were white (53.5%), with the next largest group identifying as Asian-Americans (24.4%), the remaining participants were made up of Multiracial individuals (2.7%) as well as Hispanic (7.1%), Native (2.5%) and African Americans (6.5%). Additionally, in regard to income, roughly 77 percent of participants indicated their household earned less than 80,000 dollars annually.  Further, roughly 90 percent of all participants earned a household income of less than 100,000 dollars annually. While gender was relatively evenly split, these findings illustrate the majority of survey respondents were college-educated, white and earn less than 100,000 dollars annually. This illustrates some diversity but, like all studies, the survey findings may not perfectly reflect perceptions of the total consumer population. The full demographic breakdown can be found in Appendix B, Figure 1.1.  Perceived Support Designation. Respondents were asked to designate each company’s level of support for LGBTQ+ issues and equality on a Likert scale, “1” being strongly oppose, “5” being strongly favor. Results indicate respondents found Starbucks, Apple, Amazon and Ben & Jerry’s to be most in favor of policies that support LGBTQ+ individuals. Chick Fil A and Barilla were selected as least in favor of such policies. The question and findings are listed as Figures 2.1 and 2.2 in Appendix B. The complete survey is listed in Appendix D.  30 Top of Mind Designation. Respondents were asked to select the company that came to their mind first when thinking about LGBTQ+ issues and equality. The top three companies most frequently selected were Amazon (21%), Chick Fil A (20.4%), and Ben & Jerry’s (15.3%). The survey question and findings are listed as Figure 3.1 in Appendix B.   Test of H1. To test H1, a Spearmen’s correlation was performed to determine the relationship between the total number of social media posts referencing the LGBTQ+ keywords, by the 10 LGBTQ+ companies, as listed in the Methodology section, and respondents’ top of mind ratings for those companies. Adapted from approaches set forth by Macmillan et al (2004), question 2 of the survey required respondents to indicate which of the listed brands first came to mind in the context of LGBTQ+ issues. There was a strong positive monotonic correlation between two variables (r = .67, p< .01). Crimson Hexagon findings and full results of the Spearman’s analysis are listed as Table 1 and Table 2 in Appendix B.  Test of H2-H4. The results of hierarchical regression analysis are presented in Table 4. The variables entered into the regression accounted for 44% of total explained variance. Among the explained variance, the variable in the second block, perceived fit, contributed to the dependent variable most, accounting for about 16% of the explained variance, followed by the variable in the last block (14%), demographic variables in the first block (13%), and issue stance in the third block (about 2%).  In the first block (M1a), key demographic variables of respondents were entered. These served as control variables in the analysis. When these demographics were entered into the regression model, four variables turned out to be significant in predicting Ben & Jerry’s reputation with regard to the LGBTQ+ issue. Education was positively associated with the dependent variable (β = .14, p < .01). Being Democrat had a positive effect on perceived reputation, whereas ideological leaning toward the right was negatively associated with the  31 dependent variable (β = -.22, p < .01). Those who identified as LGBTQ tended to give higher ratings on Ben & Jerry’s reputation (β = .50, p < .001).  From the second block of regression, the most meaningful change was observed for the regression coefficient of education, which was significant in the first block. When the fit was entered in the second block, the previously significant coefficient (β = .14, p < .01) for education turned out to be non-significant. This implies that education is potentially correlated with the perceived fit. Indeed, there is a high correlation between education and perceived fit (see Table 3).  In the first model (M1a), the most significant predictor for the dependent variable is the sexual orientation variable. Those who identified themselves as LGBT tend to give Ben & Jerry’s higher ratings of corporate reputation (β = .50, p < .001). Both political identification in terms of being Democrats (β = .41, p < .01) and ideological leaning toward the right (β = -.22, p < .01) are also positively associated with corporate reputation, even though the direction of relationship is opposite.  In the second model (M1b) where perceived fit was entered as additional predictor, the perceived fit yielded a strong regression coefficient (β = .50, p < .001). The result indicates that perceived fit between organizational identity and advocated issue plays a vital role in issue-specific corporate reputation.   This result supports H2: Perceived fit between organizational identity and advocated social issue will have a positive effect on issue-specific corporate reputation.  In the third block (M1c), Ben & Jerry’s stance on the LGBT issue was entered. As predicted in H3, perceived favorable stance had a positive effect on the dependent variable (β = .18, p < .01). Therefore, H3 was supported.  In the final model (M1d), the effect of perceived authenticity on the dependent variable was analyzed, while controlling for demographic variables, perceived fit, and issue stance.  32 Consistent with the prediction in H4, the final model showed that perceived authenticity was the strongest predictor for corporate reputation (β = .59, p < .001) among all the variables analyzed for the regression. This result supports H4. Three demographic variables (Democrats, ideological leaning toward the right, and LGBTQ identifiers) remained significant in the final model, indicating their effect in predicting Ben & Jerry’s issue-specific reputation is robust. Both perceived fit (β = .16, p < .001) and issue stance (β = .10, p < .001) also remained significant. However, their effects in predicting reputation have significantly dropped when these variables were controlled for in the final model. When it comes to perceived fit, the β score in the second model was .50 (p < .001), which has reduced to .16 (p <.01) in the final model. As for issue stance, the β score in the third model was .18 (p < .01): however, it has reduced to .10 (p < .05) in the final model. These results suggest that perceived fit and perceive authenticity are highly correlated. Indeed, the bivariate correlation results show that these two variables are highly correlated (r = .57, p < .001), although they are conceptually different. Full results are listed as Table 4 in Appendix B. Test of H5 & H6. The results of hierarchical regression analysis are presented in Table 5 of the Appendix. The variables entered into the regression accounted for 48 percent of the total explained variance. The variable in Block 4, authenticity, contributed to the dependent variable most, accounting for about 20 percent of the explained variance. Perceived fit, the variable in Block 2 accounted for 16 percent, and demographic variables in Block 1 accounted for 12 percent. Perceived issue stance did not account for any portion of the total explained variance.  In the first block (M1a), demographic variables of respondents were entered. Variables included age, education, political identification, age, sexual orientation, gender, income, and race. These served as control variables in the analysis. Results of the regression model indicated four variables turned out being significant in predicting brand loyalty of Ben & Jerry’s in the  33 context of LGBTQ+ issues. Education level was positively associated with the dependent variable (β = .18, p < .01). Identifying politically with the Democratic party also had a positive effect on perceived brand loyalty (β = .11, p < .01). Conversely age was negatively associated with the dependent variable (β = -.11, p < .05). Additionally, LGBTQ+ sexual orientation was positively associated with the dependent variable (β = .19, p < .01). Additionally, in the first model (M1a), sexual orientation (β = .19, p < .01) and education (β = .18, p < .01) were nearly tied as the most significant predictors for the dependent variable. Those who identified themselves as LGBT tend to indicate brand loyalty towards Ben & Jerry’s (β = .19, p < .01). While education level was positively correlated with brand loyalty towards Ben & Jerry’s (β = .18, p < .01). Political identification in terms of being Democrat (β = .11, p < .01) and age (β = -.11, p <.05) are positively associated with brand loyalty, but with inverse relationships.   From the second block of regression, the most meaningful change was observed for the regression coefficient of education, which was significant in the first block. When the fit was entered in the second block, the previously significant coefficient (β = .18, p < .01) for education turned out to be non-significant. Similarly, there was a distinct change observed for the regression coefficient of sexual orientation from ( β = .19, p < .01) to (β = .15, p < .01) when entered into the second block. This supports the notion that education and sexual orientation are potentially correlated with the perceived fit.   In the second model (M1b), perceived fit was inputted as an additional predictor. The perceived fit addition produced a strong regression coefficient (β = .42, p < .001). This suggests perceived fit between organizational identity and the advocated issue can significantly increase consumer brand loyalty.    34 This result supports H5:  Perceived fit between organizational identity and the issue advocated will have a positive effect on brand loyalty. The effect of perceived authenticity on the dependent variable was analyzed in the final model (M1d), controlling for demographic variables, perceived fit, and issue stance. Consistent with the projection in H6, results yielded a strong regression coefficient (β = .57, p < .001). This illustrated that perceived authenticity was the strongest predictor for brand loyalty among all the variables analyzed. This result supports H6:  Perceived authenticity will have a positive effect on brand loyalty. Three demographic variables (age, education and LGBTQ+ sexual orientation) remained significant in the final model, indicating as significant predictors of Ben & Jerry’s brand loyalty. Perceived fit (β = .12, p < .001) and authenticity (β = .57, p < .001) also remained significant throughout the course of the analysis. However, the effect of perceived fit in predicting brand loyalty significantly dropped when controlled for in the final model. Specifically, the β score for perceived fit in the second model was .42 (p < .001), which decreased to .12 (p <.01) in the final model. The β score for in the final model was a robust .57 (p < .001). Overall, these results indicate perceived fit and perceived authenticity are highly correlated. Full results of the analysis are listed as Table 5 in Appendix B.       Discussion  35 The current research examined the effects of corporate social advocacy on corporate identity. Through preliminary research, a conceptual definition of CSA was crafted as to differentiate the concept from related topics like CPA and CSR.  This definition served as the foundation for subsequent components of this study. Built from this conceptual foundation, LGBTQ+ rights and equality became the focal point. Companies were selected based on their notoriety in the context of LGBTQ+ advocacy and denunciation. From this selection, Ben & Jerry’s was designated as the sample for an analysis of social media conversations and consumer insights.  As part of the analysis, results from social analytics were compared with consumer survey data. This method paralleled the approach taken by agenda-setting theory researchers which examined salient media agendas as compared to public perception (Lee, 2016; Meijer & Kleinnijenhuis, 2006; Berger, 2001). Analogous to studies conducted by Meijer and Kleinnijenhuis (2006), this thesis examined linkages between issue-ownership by CSA and issue-specific corporate reputation. However, this thesis differentiated its conceptualized issue ownership. It defined issue ownership as including CSA social media efforts and thus assumed such communications impacted public perceptions of the advocating company. An analysis of these conversations as compared with consumer data demonstrated a significant correlation between the volume of social media conversations citing both LGBTQ issues and advocating companies with publics’ top-of-mind ratings. This supported the notion that CSA was an effective method of issue ownership.   Establishing this correlation served as the preliminary step in research. Subsequent analyses examined the influence of CSA on consumer perceptions and assessments of the advocating company’s issue-specific reputation. Literature on CSR and CPA indicated the concepts of the CSA-brand fit and CSA authenticity are crucial variables. These were tested via  36 consumer surveys and results were examined. In support of the hypotheses, perceived fit and perceived authenticity were positively correlated with both corporate reputation and brand loyalty.  Perceived authenticity was found to be the strongest predictor for both corporate reputation and brand loyalty. Overall this means, the greater the perceived fit between a firm’s identity and promoted social issue, the more positive evaluations about the company’s reputation and the stronger consumer brand loyalty. Similarly, greater perceived authenticity of the company’s advocacy efforts results in more positive evaluations about the company’s reputation and stronger brand loyalty. Perceived favorable stance was found to be a predictor of corporate reputation but had no impact on brand loyalty. This means where a consumer shares the same stance on an issue as expressed by the company’s advocacy efforts, the company’s reputation will be evaluated more positively. This research also has a theoretical implication for CSA theory. Palazzo & Scherer (2006) emphasized the importance of establishing moral legitimacy to achieve positive outcomes of CSR and CSA efforts. This legitimacy is the differentiating factor between CSR and CPA efforts. Additionally, CSA can spark political CSR where legitimacy is established, and efforts are continuously employed over time. To do so, companies should establish the fit alignment between issues being advocated for and its identity. Findings of this thesis reinforce the concept advanced by Castelló, Etter and Nielsen’s (2016) that the use of social media platforms to facilitate dialogue with various stakeholder groups may serve as an effective method of establishing legitimacy.   Practical implications are relatively straightforward. These findings illustrate that talk is not cheap. They support Ehrnström-Fuentes (2016) assertion that legitimacy building through stakeholder dialogue is crucial to successfully retaining and strengthening its consumer base.  37 This means public relations professionals should allocate resources to curating CSA efforts via social media platforms. These efforts should be consistent and genuine. Companies that flip-flop on issues may still be perceived by stakeholders for their original negative stance. For example, despite Barilla’s public apology and continuous efforts to implement diversity initiatives, respondents still perceived them as being unsupportive of policies that support the LGBTQ+ community (See Figures 2.1 & 2.2, Appendix B). This again reinforces the sentiment that CSA matters and has lingering implications. Public relations professionals should also understand that most companies are not inherently aligned with a stance or cause. Therefore, CSR and CSA efforts should complement each other and be implemented consistently over time to cultivate authentic alignment. Implications for CSA efforts are twofold. In some instances, taking a stance or promoting a cause may have a positive impact on corporate reputation evaluation and brand loyalty. However, public relations professionals should understand CSA efforts may also result in an inevitable loss of brand loyalty and decrease in reputation evaluation by stakeholders that oppose the stance taken. Public relations professionals are in the unenviable position of being tasked with making these value determinations and should be guided by the companies underlying mission and values.        Limitations  38 The most notable limitation is the lack of demographic diversity in consumer survey respondents. As seen in Figure 1.1. of Appendix B, a majority of respondents were white, male, had at least some college education and earned less than 100,000 dollars annually. The majority of respondents also did not identify as LGBTQ+. As a result, findings were limited to respondents with similar socio-economic characteristics. To further validate the findings, future research should expand to include a larger pool of more diverse respondents. Additionally, the social media analytics aspect of this study was limited to an examination of total social media posts. Designations were made between news media sources and non-news media sources. However, no designation was made between consumer conversations and company sourced messaging. Technology permitting, further research could examine differences between the volume of company sourced message and the volume of consumer conversations. This designation could illuminate which group has more influence in controlling the conversation surrounding CSA efforts. This would also demonstrate the need for CSA resource allocation. Where consumers have a greater ability to craft CSA conversations, potential marketing strategies should be adapted to better target those groups. However, if company messaging efforts were found to have greater influence, more resources should be allocated to fulfill those CSA messaging efforts.       APPENDIX  39 A.

    "abstract": "Companies are constantly sharing and posting content related to social issues. It is             increasingly becoming an expectation for brands to take a stance on such controversies             even where they may not be inherently related or relevant to the company’s daily             activity. However, the extent to which this form of advocacy has residual effects on the             advocating company is still unclear. This thesis aims to provide clarity on this matter             by examining its impact on consumers’ relationship with the company and related             perceptions.\nAn online survey was conducted in March 2020. Findings were compared with social             analytic research. A correlation analysis suggested a connection between post volume             referencing the advocated issue and consumer perception of the company being associated             with that issue. Analysis of survey results indicated that perceived fit between             organizational identity and advocated issue impacts issue-specific corporate reputation.             Findings also suggest perceived fit and perceived authenticity are highly correlated.             Perceived fit between organizational identity and advocated social issue are also found             to have positive effects on issue-specific reputation. Brand loyalty was similarly             predicted by perceived fit and perceived authenticity of corporate social advocacy.\nPractical and theoretical implications for research are discussed",
