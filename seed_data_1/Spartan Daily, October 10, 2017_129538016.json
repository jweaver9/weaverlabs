The panel has been held every year in the ChAD department for the past three years. Janene Perez, the Director of Lurie College Student Success Center, hosted the event. The panel focused on Perez’s class for Community-Based Organizations.“I was fi nding that a lot of students didn’t have any experience working in or volunteering in non-profi ts or in community-based organizations,” Perez said. “They also had a lot of questions and anxiety around that next step.”The panel featured ChAD alumni who answered current ChAD students’ questions and gave them advice. Some of the questions students asked alumni were, “How did you get the job that you have now?”, “Is there anyone in their dream job?” and “Do you think that grad school is benefi cial?” “A lot of students have the expectation that they are going to jump right into their dream job and that garners a lot of anxiety because it’s a lot of pressure,” Perez said. Perez teaches ChAD, Adult Supervision for Programs Serving Children, Youth, and Families and Practicum in Community-Based Organizations Serving Children and Youth. “Our fi rst graduating group of the practicum students, quite a few of them got hired on by their practicum site,” Perez said. The ChAD panel began in Perez’s class for her students only, then when she became the director she decided to open the panel up to all students in the college. “It is a great opportunity for us to talk about the importance of volunteering, the importance of practicum experiences and internship experiences and that impression that you leave,” Perez said.The panel of seven alumni were all previously in Perez’s classes and returned to share their experiences of life after college. “It’s nice because it’s things I wish I Volume 149, Issue 20 www.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily Tuesday, October 10, 2017Learn about SJSU graduate programs and admissions requirements.

Black shared stories about his upbringing and struggles with coming to terms with his sexuality in a Mormon household. He hid the fact that he was gay and felt hopeless throughout his childhood and into his teenage years until he heard about Harvey Milk, a gay rights activist and politician.“I was 15 or 16, and for the very fi rst time in my life I heard a leader leading with hope and not fear,” Black said. “That grab of hope actually included me. [Milk] had given his life to make sure I had hope and I could one day dream of freedom and change my life.”In 1977, Milk was the fi rst openly gay person elected to public offi ce in California as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Black won an Academy Award in 2008 for his original screenplay titled “Milk.” The biographical fi lm focuses on the late Milk, portrayed by actor Sean Penn. He went on to talk about how Milk inspired him to embrace his true self little by little. In college, he became an active member of the LGBTQ community and got involved in various LGBTQ organizations at the UCLA fi lm school. His experiences there compelled him to take on a leadership role in the fi ght for LGBTQ rights.“I wasn’t afraid to stick out,” Black said. “I no longer saw the ‘horns’ the Mormon prophets said I was going to see [for being gay].”Black is also a founding board member of the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER).

According to the Washington Blade, AFER paid more than $6.4 million to two law fi rms that successfully argued against the proposition. The following year, he walked in the National Equality March and delivered a speech at the United States Capitol to LGBT activists.He also created the miniseries “When We Rise” on ABC which is about the modern LGBT rights movement in America. It chronicles the current struggles of LGBTQ American citizens.San Jose State students who attended called Black’s dialogue “critical” to discuss on college campuses.“I think the fi eld of queer studies in fi lm and literature is growing and it needs to keep growing,” education and music senior Anthony Prickett said. “Having speakers like [Black] that bring diverse voices in terms of sexuality and gender is one really big step to bringing that dialogue out more and more.”Pickett noted that the word “queer” is a former derogatory word used against homosexual people, but has been reclaimed in the LGBTQ community as a liberating self-identity.“A lot more people our age are openly LGBTQ,” art history freshman Jackie Friedland said. “Unlike other eras that were closed up about it, we need to have an open dialogue.”would have had known,” SJSU graduate and mental health counselor Ryan Noble said. “The job I found I didn’t know about. If I would have known about it then, I would have been more motivated to do more stuff back then to try harder.” All alumni are now working for different companies and organizations around the Bay Area such as Reading Partners, Seneca Family of Agencies and Family Supportive Housing. “It’s a great opportunity to come back and speak to the students because when I was a student it was defi nitely helpful to hear from alumni to see where they were in their current roles,” SJSU graduate and Family Learning Center Coordinator Beatriz Sanchez said. Perez plans to continue having a ChAD panel each semester so that students are more informed about what to expect after they graduate.“It’s one my favorite days,” Perez said. “As an instructor I don’t think that you could ask for anything more than having your students doing good things out in the world.” Tuesday, October 10, 2017Gender equity center discusses emotional abuse The Gender Equity Center held  its Lunch & Learn Discussion on Monday afternoon in the Student Union to discuss emotional abuse.Domesticviolence.org defi nes domestic violence and emotional abuse as “behaviors used by one person in a relationship to control the other. Partners may be married or not married; heterosexual, gay or lesbian; living together, separated or dating.”“These types of conversations you don’t usually have out and about on campus,” psychology junior Kayla Harper-Alvarez said. “It’s okay to not know something, it’s okay to ask to clarify a question. You come here to literally learn.”The Gender Equity Center organizes these discussions to provide an open forum for students to discuss issues in a safe and confidential space.Students that attended learned about “blame-shaming, denial and gaslighting,” three major terms that are involved with emotional abuse.Gaslighting is when the abuser manipulates the abused into questioning their own sanity.The term was coined after the 1944 fi lm “Gaslight,” where an opera singer is manipulated by her husband into thinking she is going crazy when gaslights seem to dim without being touched.   Students’ eyes wandered anxiously around the room, waiting for a response to opinions regarding gender roles swap (women who abuse men), issues of superiority in trans relationships and family dynamics.Students started to participate when it came to discussing how to approach someone who is being emotionally violated. A highlight of the discussion came from industrial and systems engineering senior Faith Mamaril. She spoke of her personal experience involving a recent abusive relationship and what she did to get herself out of that situation.“I think it’s important for these stories and experiences to be told, so that way if someone like me, an extremely empathetic person, gets into a relationship, they know how to leave safely and in a healthy way,” Mamaril said. Education Programmer Sam Brechlin lead the discussion and provided her own experience with an abusive relationship. She wanted to bring awareness to students about the different kinds of abuse that are represented and bring awareness to them. Brechlin generally never uses her personal experiences in these discussions, but felt compelled during this conversation to use them as connecting points. “I try to [not] bring my personal issues in work for a lot of reasons, [but mainly so] I can support others better,” Brechlin said. “I rather use my experiences as connecting points, but having these moments where I can sit at a table and be like ‘this is a validation for myself’ is powerful.”She uses simple and traditional facilitation tactics to get participants to engage in the discussions. Brechlin encourages others by asking questions but also allows for silence in order for people to process information.The Gender Equity Center also provides off campus resources for students affected by abuse.

Saurman Provocative Lecture Series.“I really think he did a good job talking about income inequality,” economics freshman Daniel Kokavinch said. Kokavinch added that the lecture provided a different opinion on the issue, which he found interesting. Horwitz spoke about how the gap between the rich and the poor is not as big as the general public perceives. During the lecture, he presented a slide showing the average household income in the 1960s.Horwitz listed what households were able to buy on an average income and compared it with what today’s average allows families to afford. “I think it’s really important for students to be exposed to the best arguments on all sides of issues and to see data and let them then decide,” Horwitz said. Horwitz added he got the reaction he hoped for from students because they began to think about what he presented. Economics freshman Tyler White said it was a provocative lecture because it is different from the ‘tax the rich’ argument he often hears.“He really showed a different aspect that you never really thought about,” White said. “He had really good statistics to prove why it is how it really is.” White added that the lecture encourages him to look up any statistics the media uses to persuade the public. “Even the facts he showed I have to look into to make sure everything is actually true,” White said. “Obviously the media is portraying things in different ways.” Horwitz is the John H. Schnatter Distinguished Professor of Free Enterprise in the Department of Economics at Ball State University in Muncie, Inidana and a member of the Foundation For Economic Education (FEE) Faculty Network. FEE is a think tank whose mission is to educate young people, ages 16-24, on economics, how markets work and what a free society looks like, according to Horwitz. Horwitz obtained his masters and doctorate in economics from George Mason University and a bachelor’s in economics and philosophy from the University of Michigan. His most recent book, “Hayek’s Modern Family: Classical Liberalism and the Evolution of Social Institutes,” was published in 2015. After the lecture, the more than 100 attendees had the opportunity to ask questions. People asked for his opinion on programs to help military veterans, why people have the perception of an increased economic gap and if automation is good for Americans. Horwitz said he would agree with funding programs to help veterans. He also said people are angry at a wage gap because they see the economic system as unfair, but noted that the only way to get rich is to provide value in the market. He cited Steve Jobs as an example. Automation frees laborers to do jobs society values highly, Horwitz added. It has lowered prices of consumer products and food and made them more widely available. “I hope that people who attended — not just the students but folks from the community and faculty members — now are thinking ‘okay, wait, maybe this inequality and poverty stuff is a little more complicated,’” Horwitz said.GUIDANCEContinued from page 1JENAE MIMS | SPARTAN DAILYChAD senior Tanya Romero asks alumni several questions about life after college. “I think it’s important for these stories and experiences to be told.”Faith MamarilEngineering seniorFollow Jenae on Twitter@jenaemims_Follow Noe on Twitter@NoeMaganaRLecture explores inequality and being poor in AmericaBY NOE MAGANAStaff  Writer “Unlike other eras that were closed up about it, we need to have an open dialogue.”Jackie Friedland Art history freshmanBY SALVATORE MAXWELLStaff  Writer 3 A&ETuesday, October 10, 2017Pumpkin patch caters to upscale neighborhoodDiwali celebrates Indian cultureThe Children’s Discovery Museum hosted the Diwali Festival over the weekend as part of its Cultural Celebration series. The two-day event celebrated Indian culture with performances, activities, crafts and sweets.Diwali is officially on Oct. 19 this year, but locals gathered earlier for India’s largest holiday known as the festival of lights.“I feel at home,” said Santa Clara resident Rakhi Sachdeva. “I don’t see a difference. Any time I post any pictures or let my friends back home [India] know, they’re always struck like, ‘Wow, this is exactly what we’re doing, what you’re doing.’” Primarily observed by Hindus, the celebration has also expanded to Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. With festivities lasting for up to five days, Diwali signifies the victory of good over evil, according to DiwaliFestival.org. Additionally, the exchange of gifts is a large part of the celebration as it’s a gesture showing love and affection. From the lighting of candles to the paper-crafted lanterns to the vibrant-colored clothing, the family-oriented event featured customs which many locals cherished in India. Sachdeva brought her daughter to the Diwali celebration for the second year in a row. She said the devolvement of the Indian community has made it easier to celebrate her culture and other cultures as well.First-time attendee Damodar Koya, who’s lived in San Jose for three years after moving from India, felt the same way. “It’s a huge festival in India, so here we miss that,” Koya said. “This feels good. We can just plug in and then don’t miss much of our home culture.”Koya’s daughter participated in one of the many performances held in the Cadence Amphitheatre.About 60 people attended the “Dhoom DNA” performance which featured a group of 13 young girls in dazzling dresses and jewelry, dancing to traditional Indian music.The exuberant dancers were cheered on by families and friends looking on as the choreography energized the crowd.A fashion show also took place, which participant Neha Yallavula said was her favorite part of the day.The colorful dresses on display varied from bright floral prints to satin blue fabrics with gold accents — bringing more light to the festival.To make things sweeter, museum staff gave out a milk-based dessert named burfi for attendees to sample.The popular Indian sweet, made with milk, sugar and flavored with an Indian spice called cardamom, is a common treat enjoyed during Diwali. Longtime event participant and museum volunteer Sindhu Ravuri embraced the museum’s fifth celebration of the festival.“When I was going to these events, I saw a lot of similarities between my culture and other cultures,” Ravuri said. “It makes me feel validated as an Indian-American that my culture is being celebrated by other people from different ethnicities, too.” WILLIAM YAP | SPARTAN DAILY(Top) Glass pumpkins were displayed at Santana Row as part of the third annual glass pumpkin patch. (Bottom) A crowd gathers to watch Bay Area Glass Institute senior instructor Treg Silkwood and San Jose artist Kien Ngo create a glass pumpkin.One of the last things someone can expect to see at a high-end shopping area are pumpkins and hay bales. However, the Bay Area Glass Institute (BAGI) held its third annual glass pumpkin patch in Santana Row this past weekend.“It’s like a ‘boujee’ pumpkin patch,” Campbell resident Emily Minkler said.The term “boujee” was popularized by the rap group Migos. According to Urban Dictionary, “boujee” is an abbreviation of the French term “bourgeois,” which is used to describe people who act as if they belong to a high social class.The main items for sale were glass sculptures of pumpkins in various sizes. Visitors could choose from a wide array of colors with different features, such as polka dots or a golden trim. There were also glass sculptures of fall-related items, such as a pumpkin stem goblet.These items were on display in Santana Row Park, located between Vintage Wine Bar and Jardin De Consuelo. At the epicenter of deluxe architecture and live music were glass pumpkins perched on hay bales and vegetable gardens.Some of the smallest glass pumpkins were the size of a ping pong ball and sold for about $30. The largest glass pumpkin on display was the size of a standard 12-pound pumpkin and sold for $650.Bay Area Glass Institute is a public access glass studio based in San Jose. Executive director Damon Gustafson said it is also a nonprofit organization and is partially funded by the City of San Jose’s Office of Cultural Affairs.Gustafson said the organization expanded its annual glass pumpkin patch to Santana Row after achieving success at the Palo Alto Art Center, where BAGI has held the event for 22 years.“They [Santana Row] draw a crowd that matches our most likely buyer,” Gustafson said. “An affluent crowd and people who are looking for good art.”Although the pumpkin patch was about the size of a basketball court, large groups of people constantly moved in and out of the venue. Maneuvering through the crowd in a condensed space felt equivalent to walking in the San Jose Flea Market on a busy day, but on a smaller scale.About every 30 minutes, BAGI senior instructor Treg Silkwood would demonstrate how to make a glass pumpkin. For roughly 10 minutes, a crowd would gather to witness Silkwood stick an iron rod into a burning furnace and produce a glass pumpkin, complete with a stem.“Watching the process is really magical,” Silkwood said. “It’s a very fl uid dance of molten glass and quick movements.”Gustafson said proceeds from the event will benefi t BAGI and the approximate 25 artists that collaborated with the organization for the glass pumpkin patch.“By shopping with us and participating in our patch, people are really helping to keep Bay Area arts alive and keep artists in the city,” Gustafson said.BYWILLIAM YAPStaff  WriterFollow William on Twitter@TheDapperYapFrom babies to elderly couples, Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon runners took over downtown San Jose last weekend.“I finished! That’s always a good thing,” San Jose resident Brian Little said. “I was never a good runner, but I run because I [still] can.”Some participants were running with baby strollers and their partners by their side. The marathon started on West Santa Clara Street. Little has been participating in this event for the past four years. After recovering from a heart attack four years ago, he has been walking about five miles every day.“I’ve done this marathon for the last four to five years, so my wife and I always do 5K on Saturday and 10K on Sunday,” Little said.Little added that some people had safety concerns because of the recent incident in Las Vegas, but San Jose did a great job enforcing the security and safety for the event. “I needed a goal or something to stay active, moving and going,” Redwood City resident Sharlene Ericson said. “There are a lot of people playing music, and you see people in a better mood.”Ericson is currently five months pregnant – she and her husband ran a 13.1K on Sunday.“For the first one, the last 5K, I died,” Ericson said. “I had to walk most of it, so this time was way better.”Several music stages were placed on the course, and performers came off the stage to cheer runners on and give them high fives. “Everyone is cheering you [on] even if they don’t know [you], and you see people holding up some fl ags or message boards,” San Jose resident Raquel D’Souza said. “There’s no barrier of race, color or nothing like that.”Even after finishing the race, a few runners walked back and cheered for the other competitors. Some people held American flags and wore makeup and costumes.“I wouldn’t have done this if I didn’t have company,” D’Souza said. “She [Tran] kept her pace to mine because I’m the slower one. I’m thankful for that.”D’Souza and Tran finished the 10k race in around one hour and 15 minutes.This year marked the 20-year anniversary of the Rock ‘n’ Roll Marathon series.

MoralityThe current tax system is a nightmare fi lled with controversial inconsistencies and injustices.With the current tax-bracket system, people have to pay higher percentages of their income the more money they make, which doesn’t make any sense.The current tax system is set up into brackets. All of your money earned up until the next bracket is taxed at one rate. The money in the next bracket is taxed at the next rate. According to the website Bank Rate, the fi rst three bracket caps for single people in 2017 are $9,325; $37,950; and $91,900. This means your money up to $9,325 is taxed at 10 percent. Your money from $9,325 to $37,950 is taxed at 15 percent, and so on.If you move up a bracket, only the money in that bracket will be taxed at a higher rate. For example, Americans who make $60,000 per year are placed in the third bracket. They will pay 10 percent on the fi rst $9,325, 15 percent on the next $28,625 and 25 percent on the last $22,050. They will not pay 25 percent for the whole $60,000.Americans should not have to pay more taxes per dollar for making more money. Everyone is equal before the law, so why do people not want a universal tax rate?We shouldn’t be punishing the wealthy for being wealthy. The upper class is demonized by the lower and middle classes and is accused of causing income inequality. The rich don’t make the poor, poor. The beauty of capitalism is we don’t have to spend money if we don’t want to spend it. Apple isn’t a multi-billion dollar company because it forces consumers to buy the latest iPhone at gunpoint.People calling for an increase in taxes on the rich and cuts for the poor have a grave misunderstanding of economics. “It’s hard to lower taxes on people who are actually receiving net-benefi ts from the government,” political journalist Ben Shapiro said in a vlog.Taxes go toward government-funded programs like disability, welfare and social security to help Americans who cannot provide for themselves fi nancially. The wealthy, who contribute the majority of this funding, don’t need to rely on the government programs as much as the poor who pay very little taxes. “The richest 20 percent of Americans by income aren’t just paying a share of federal taxes that would be considered fair,” American Enterprise Institute’s Mark Perry said.  “They’re shouldering almost 100% of the entire federal tax burden of transfer payments and all other non-fi nanced government spending.”Shapiro believes that whatever people put into taxes, they should get back in services. Taxes should go toward services that cannot be supplied reasonably another way, like police forces or road maintenance, rather than services that can be bought elsewhere. The rich should be taxed the same as everyone else. A single tax bracket encompassing every American would be more fair.We should strive to help workers. According to Shapiro, businesses would feel more comfortable investing under a fl at tax system they know won’t change.“You don’t tax corporations, you tax people,” economics professor Jeffrey Hummel said. “Taxing capital accumulation for businesses hurts workers.” The tax system should be fair and effective. Putting all of the work on the wealthy is unfair, and people should get out what they put in, rather than having the wealthy pay for everything.Jonas ElamStaff  WriterFollow Jonas on Twitter@TheElamiteFocus on the real issues, my body shouldn’t be regulatedTwo days after the deadliest shooting in our country’s modern history, the United States House of Representatives voted in favor of H.R. 36, or the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Act. Instead of considering legislation that could prevent a shooting like this from happening again, Congress is trying to pass legislation that would tell me, a woman, what I can and cannot do with my body. The bill states it would ban abortions after 20 weeks except in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the mother or when the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. If Congress can’t pass legislation to regulate guns, they certainly should not be passing legislation to regulate women’s bodies and our health care decisions. As a woman, I can not fathom how the 431 men serving in Congress have no issue at all passing legislation that may affect my health. Don’t they have sisters and daughters? They certainly have mothers. How do they sleep at night? Apparently, without a problem.Accounting and women, gender and sexuality studies senior Kristen Flaten sees this move by Congress as an attempt at “fulfi lling their agenda to abolish birth control, restrict access to health care and limit women’s rights overall.”Bills like this one have failed twice before in 2013 and 2015.Many who voted in favor of the bill justify their position with the argument that fetuses can feel pain after 20 weeks of gestation. However, a study done by the University of California, San Francisco reported that evidence indicated fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester, which begins at 27 to 28 weeks from conception.Planned Parenthood reports that only one percent of abortions are late-term. Most are due to serious medical “situations where a woman and her doctor need every medical option available.”Flaten believes lawmakers are not qualified to be making legislation that attempts to regulate women’s bodies. “They are not qualified because they are not doctors,” Flaten said. “Most of them are men. It’s not within their area of expertise.”Lawmakers are unaware of what conversations women have behind closed doors with their doctors. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement condemning the ban. “This cruel ban would leave many women without appropriate treatment options,” the statement read.Leaving women in life-threatening situations because of a lack of treatment options that would result from this ban on late-term abortions is ethically wrong. In addition, the bill is unconstitutional because it directly undermines the decision made in 1973 when the Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade.I have hope though. Bills like this have failed before. The bill is set to go to the Senate and is not expected to pass. Even if by some unfortunate circumstance the bill gets through the senate and ends up on the president’s desk, I believe in the checks and balances in our government and have faith that the Supreme Court would make the right decision based upon the precedent set in 1973.Follow Sarah on Twitter@sarah_klievesSarah KlievesPhoto EditorKaylee LawlerStaff  WriterFollow Kaylee  on Twitter@kayleelawler94Instructors should not have to deal with handling guns When it comes to violence in schools across the United States, it shouldn’t be instructors’ jobs to protect themselves and their students from any perpetrators on campus. That job is law enforcement’s duty. In states like Colorado and Ohio, some educators are taking courses to educate themselves  about fi rearms and going to shooting ranges. According to the Denver Post, teachers and staff from rural areas are arming themselves. Colorado law prohibits fi rearms in the classroom but allows security personnel to be armed.  These schools found a loophole by reclassifying some of their instructors and staff as security personnel.Gun advocates should take into consideration the fact that some K-12 and college instructors don’t have the time to attend gun safety classes. Students at SJSU voiced their concerns about instructors getting training or even the idea of them carrying guns. “[There] would have to be a lot of training for it to fi nally happen,” psychology junior Jasmine Ventura said.According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, in 2010 unintentional firearm injuries caused the deaths of 606 people.“I do understand the point of ‘good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns,’ but I don’t think that’s always the case,” forensic chemistry freshman Adrianna Bautista said. “There's always the possibility of accidents happening. Training does help, but again I just don't personally feel comfortable around guns.”To get a Firearm Safety Certifi cate (FSC), individuals must take a course at places like Bay Area Firearms, which offers a 3 hour, 40 minute class for $159. A First Steps Pistol certifi cation  is a prerequisite, however, and another $159 out of your pocket. “A couple of days of gun training is nothing really at all,” kinesiology freshman Marco Eosano said. “You're basically a newborn holding a gun.” In California, it is illegal to openly carry a weapon outside of your residence, private property or business, but you can carry a concealed weapon if you obtain a conceal carry license according to the California Penal Code.  If anyone other than law enforcement or security was to carry a weapon on campuses, some laws would need to change.University Police Department Captain Alan Cavallo expressed doubts about whether arming faculty is practical at San Jose State. “Just for starters, offi cers go through six months of training and then a minimum of two, 10-hour training days per year, just to be qualifi ed to carry a fi rearm,” Cavallo said. “I do not see school staff having the time or energy or want to put this kind of time into the process, not to mention the cost.”A traumatic event such as a school shooting takes a toll on individuals whether they are law enforcement, instructors or students. According to the National Center for PTSD, “As many as 77 percent of kids who witness a school shooting may develop post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a scary or life-threatening event.”Symptoms could include anxiety, diffi culty sleeping, fl ashbacks, aggression, emotional detachment and physical pain.In order to reduce the risk of students developing PTSD, they should seek out counseling, join a support group, keep in touch with friends and family and get involved with community.California has strict gun laws so the average instructor can’t carry on campus, and it should stay that way. We don’t need teachers to be the heroes. Instructors can create barricades and support students during a school shooting. Leave the fi ght for the professionals.5 OPINIONTuesday, October 10, 2017CLASSIF IEDSCROSSWORD PUZZLESOLUTIONS 10/05/2017ACROSS1. Cogs5. Heroic tales10. Decay from overrip-ening14. Buckeye State15.

Body shaming is a vital issue among human beings because almost everyone faces it at some point in their life.“All my life until just recently, I’ve been the chubby friend, the fat brother,” undeclared junior Jose Villegas said. “People constantly reminded me of the body I was in.”Body shaming is created through television, magazines and the internet. We live in a world full of nothing but stereotypes and we’re nothing but judgmental. The media has the power to deem the epitome of “beauty” and “ugly.”“[I have experienced body shaming] mostly about being short and too skinny. My brother would say I would look like a third world country child,” psychology freshman Astrid Sarinana said. As shown in the documentaries “Miss Representation” and “Tough Guise,” women are portrayed as petite and men are seen as muscular. If people of these genders do not meet those qualifications, they are immediately looked down upon. From cartoons to adult shows, action figures and dolls, there is an immense amount of body shaming. Since childhood, a negative concept of “beauty” is engraved into our minds.“Kids teased me from middle school through high school, girls would say “eww,” if they found out I liked them, nobody wanted me on their team during P.E.,” Villegas said. “It hurt so much and it still does.” Body shaming is a form of bullying, because even though you’re not physically hurting someone, emotionally you have tarnished them forever. According to the website DoSomething.org, “Low self-esteem in adolescents can lead to eating disorders, early sexual activity, substance use and suicidal thoughts.” We have no right to judge someone based on their shape or size, let alone their appearance because it is wrong. Playing with someone’s emotions is the lowest thing you can ever do. Before you try to judge or point fingers at someone, look at yourself in the mirror first.Even I struggled with body shaming for a very long period of time. When I was in high school, I used to be 165 pounds and my family members would constantly make fun of my weight. Because I felt degraded and belittled, I started exercising during the month of Ramadan, a holy month for Muslims where they do not eat or drink from dawn to dusk. Although I lost 20 pounds and felt more confident, working out took a heavy toll on my body and I lost a significant amount of hair.“All we can do is to help embrace our self-image and to not care about what others think because at the end of the day it all comes down to the one person who matters the most — yourself,” theater freshman Charlotte Ibarra said. I learned that nothing is more important than your personal health. If people are making derogatory comments about your body, you shouldn’t care about what they have to say, because they don’t matter and they never will. People are going to talk no matter what, and we have to ignore it because ignorance is bliss.Arooba KazmiMultimedia EditorFollow Arooba on Twitter@arooba55SPORTS6 Tuesday, October 10, 2017Spartans come back twice in one match versus New MexicoLUKE JOHNSON | SPARTAN DAILY(Top) SJSU’s Giulia Gavio celebrates after a successful spike.

(Right) SJSU’s Danny Sanchez intercepts UNLV’s Memo Diaz.Senior middle blocker Nandyala Gama’s career-high 22 kills propelled San Jose State to a comeback victory over New Mexico at home Saturday. The Spartans’ (12-5, 4-2 MW) backs were against the wall down sets 2-1 at home Saturday. “When we’re down you can get stressed out about it or you can decide to come back from it,” senior setter Breann Robinson said. “We know how to play our game. We remind ourselves that we are big and we can play big.”After SJSU won the fourth set, 25-18, the Lobos were only two points away (13-11) from closing out the match in the fi fth set. However, the Spartans rallied for four-straight points to upset their opponents. “[There was] good execution there,” head coach Jolene Shepardson said. “When we play fun defense it just brings a lot of momentum on our side and a lot of good things happen when we’re fi ghting hard on defense. Some of our transition offense was on and we were rolling, but when it was off it was back and forth. We need to be more consistent with our transition.”The Spartans received the fi rst point on attack error and kept up to speed against the Lobos. SJSU won the fi rst set, 25-18.The Lobos (10-8, 2-4) fi nished on top 25-16 in the second set and 25-21 in the third set. Even though the Lobos were in the lead, the Spartans did not lose sight of what they wanted.“When we go back to the locker room, there’s a lot of determined attitude,” Shepardson said. “You can see it in their eyes and it’s exactly what you want to see as a coach.”Robinson produced her second double-double of the week and fourth of the season with 50 assists and 10 digs. Gama added seven assisted blocks to her total points, while junior outside hitter Giulia Gavio had the second most kills in the match with 18, in addition to three aces.   “Our communication is also our responsibility for the most part,” senior libero Jamie Hirai said. “If we are lined up and serving we say what we are responsible for. [We] hold ourselves accountable for what we are supposed to do.”SJSU has six wins and two losses on the road. With a 12-5 record, the Spartans look forward to their matches against Colorado and Wyoming this coming week. “I’m excited to play on the road and silence their crowd,” Robinson said. The team will be back home to play against Nevada on Oct. 17. “We always talk about if we’re playing away we make their home court our home court,” Gama said. BY SATVIR SAINIOpinion EditorFollow Satvir on Twitter@satvirsaini_San Jose State men’s soccer continued its struggles with another loss Friday afternoon at home against the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  This 5-2 victory for UNLV marked the Rebels’ fi rst win after the mass shooting that took place Oct. 1 during the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on Las Vegas Boulevard.“I have no idea what could cause a person to do something like that,” said UNLV head coach Rich Ryerson. “There’s been great support in the community, and that has been a positive experience.” The Rebels were touched by SJSU’s demonstration of solidarity before the game. “The moment of silence was very much appreciated,” Ryerson said. Ryerson was attending a wedding reception inside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino when the shooting took place. According to the latest reporting by The New York Times, 59 people were killed and of about 22,000 festival goers in attendance that evening, more than 500 people were injured.In addition to a moment of silence before the national anthem, players and coaches on both teams also wore a red ribbon with the words “Las Vegas.”“Most people I know [in Las Vegas] were either there, close by or know someone who was directly affected,” Ryerson said. “The university (UNLV) is doing a great job providing resources and counseling for everyone needing help.”SJSU head coach Simon Tobin said he has developed a friendship with Ryerson over the years. “You wouldn’t be human if you weren’t affected by this. His team showed a lot of strength today and really played with focus,” Tobin said.The Rebels were able to take a three-goal lead, thanks in large part to senior forward Danny Musovski, who had a hat trick and assisted on UNLV’s fi fth goal.Partida felt that Friday’s loss increased the sense of “urgency” to win Sunday’s game against Grand Canyon University. “We have to win Sunday’s game and bounce back,” Partida said.Though they were able to take the game into double overtime, the Spartans were unable to win their match Sunday and were shut-out by the Antelopes. They are now winless in their last eight games.BY THOMAS SOARESCopy EditorFollow Thomas on Twitter@thomassoares9",
