Zoe is a great artist, dedicated labor \norganizer and activist, quintessential West Philly Jewish Mom, and has a mind like a steel \ntrap. Did I mention that she is gorgeous, her outfits are always ‘put together’, and she never \nages? Oy vey what a find. I love her and I am incredibly thankful that she agreed to do so \nmuch extra childcare so that I could finish this paper. I’m looking forward to preparing lots \nof cheese, chocolate, and stir fry with the vegetables cut JUST RIGHT for you! And let’s \nparty! \n To Nomi Ana Rosso-Cohen and Naftali Eliot Rosso-Cohen, my children - thank you \nfor letting Daddy spend so much time away from home. Most of all, thank you for being so \nloving and for giving me words of encouragement like, “just crush it!”.  \n To my Mom, Nan Wallace and my dad, Dave Rosso, I am so thankful for your help, \nsupport, love, and childcare. Oh, and thank you for raising me! Proud yet? To Andy Wallace, \nmy step father, thank you for helping with your ‘step-grands’ and for loving my Mom so \nwell. To my sister Jessica Nemeth, thank you so much for your words of encouragement and \nfor hosting us at Passover just as I was passing through my capstone mitzrayim. To Remy \nWallace, my brother, mazal tov on your new arrival! I very much look forward to connecting \nwhen we both come up for air! \n I next want to thank the participant-partners of this research paper - the interviewees. \nI was so humbled that you agreed to invest one hour of your time in this project. You gave \nme so much more than data. You gave your true thoughts and feelings, provided valuable \ninsights, and pushed back on my framing of this topic. More importantly, thank you for \n \nv \n \ninvesting your time in better healthcare, more diverse leadership, a more inclusive \nworkplace, and ending the injustice of health disparities.  \n Harvey Floyd and Linda Pennington, my capstone committee, were really good to \nme. Harvey provided both a voice of reason and a voice of metaphysical exploration. Linda - \nas I think about you I feel calmer already. I remember how you smiled at me knowingly in \nyour living room as I presented my disciplined, perfectly designed, yet completely \nimpossible timeline for completing the paper. As you predicted, things didn’t go how I’d \nplanned, but they did go! \nI also want to thank my MSOD community, especially Josh Levine and Colleen \nBracken. Josh - you’re a true friend and a great capstone coach. You should start a company \nor something. Oh wait, you already are. Colleen - you inspire me every single day. You say \n‘jump’, I say ‘how high?’ I also appreciate all of my peers in Cohort 6 of the Organizational \nCoaching and Consulting program! Terry, Adrianna, Josh G., Joshua B. (yes, that’s three), \nHannah, Jihad, Lisa D., Lisa H. (yes, that’s two), Cathy, & Amir! \nThank you to all my friends, fellow Kol Tzedekim, Jubilee School family! I do not \nhave room to name you all but I will call out Liz M., Isaac G., and Thomas P.  \nThank you sincerely to Annie Voutsinas, my supervisor at Wharton Executive \nEducation, whose steady hand, smarts, and guidance have meant so much to me these past \nthree years. I certainly could not have done this without you! \nLast, but not least, I want to thank my MSOD professors Janet Greco, Derek \nNewberry, Charline Russo, Phil Bergey, Ginny Vanderslice, and Aviva Legatt. Thank you \nfor teaching me, challenging me, and supporting me.

I'll go crazy if I do! I'll think about it tomorrow.”  \n- Scarlett O’Hara, Gone With the Wind \nThis capstone paper addresses the subject of effective engagement of White \nemployees in healthcare workforce inclusion strategies. But, I will not start the story in a \nhospital or doctor’s office. It starts at my home in West Philadelphia this morning at 6:21 \nAM on a cloudy but bright Sunday morning.  \nI rolled out of the pile of crumpled sheets and glanced at my smart phone to find out \nthe weather. Instead, I saw the news headline that yesterday, on April 27, 2019, a 19 year-old \nWhite nationalist walked into a synagogue near San Diego at the closing of the Passover \nholiday and opened fire, killing one and injuring three more worshippers. I am Jewish, \nWhite, and my mother was raised in San Diego. In the 5 seconds or so it took to see the \nglowing headline text, I was filled with sadness, bitterness, and fear. I felt no shock, anger, or \nurgency to act. Instead, I had the thoughts, “Here we go again,” and “Oh whatever, it’s no \nuse…” In an instant, I clicked off my phone, turned to check my wife was still sleeping, \ngathered my clothes, and walked down the hallway past the bedrooms of our two children \nand finally downstairs to knead and bake the bread dough I had started the night before.  \n In many ways, our country is a lot like me when it comes to facing White supremacy \nand racism. And just as Scarlett O’Hara felt she would “go crazy” if she faced a painful \nreality, Whites have done our best to avoid and forget how institutional racism was \nestablished and is maintained to this day. But the Presidential election in 2016, the new \n2 \n \n \n \nmedia exposure of overuse of lethal force against African Americans by police, and the many \ninstances of White supremacist violence have provided a teachable moment. Similarly, in the \nhealthcare industry, the gross and persistent disparities along racial and class lines have \npushed these issues to the fore. Healthcare leaders of diversity, equity, and inclusion now \nhave national and institutional mandates to change the interpersonal and organizational \ndynamics that cause healthcare disparities.  \nBut there is disagreement on how to change these dynamics. One critical area of \ndisagreement is whether and how to address the issue of race, and those that are \nintersectional with race, in the healthcare workplace context. Since 85% of senior healthcare \nleaders identify as White and clinical professionals are also overrepresented by White \nindividuals, this is a critical audience for engaging with the work of creating a more diverse \nand inclusive workforce. But there is significant evidence that Whites are prone to be \ndisengaged in diversity work.  \nThis situation sparks many interesting and thorny questions. Should we even address \nracial identity given that race is an emotional powder keg waiting to go off? Can we \neffectively create more inclusive working environments without directly referring to racism \nor the social construct of ‘Whiteness’? What are the best strategies and tactics for winning \nengagement of White healthcare leaders and workers for people of all racial identities? What \nare the interpersonal and organizational strategies that are most likely to result in including \nWhite employees in creating greater inclusion, for the benefit of all employees regardless of \nsocial identities? I will explore these issues through a review of literature, findings from 16 \ninterviews, and interpretation of the findings using past research and theoretical constructs as \nguides. Ultimately, my hope is that the data and insights contained in these pages helps \n3 \n \n \n \nhealthcare industry leaders to create more diverse, more inclusive, and more equitable \nworkplaces.  \nThe remainder of this introduction contains seven sections. First, I provide an overall \njustification for the research project. After a note regarding my personal interest, I present a \nbrief overview of the key literature that provided the background to the gathering of primary \ndata. Next is a statement of my research question and overall goals of the research. I then \nreveal certain key assumptions and biases that impacted the project. The sixth section is \nmethodology and the lastly, I outline the remainder of the capstone paper.  \nJustification \n In 2017, the healthcare industry became the largest employer in the United States, \nwith healthcare delivery being the largest subsector (Thompson 2018). At the same time our \ncountry is experiencing a renewed interest in facing and overcoming the impacts of racism \nand other systematic oppressions. These trends have provided leaders of diversity, equity, \nand inclusion in healthcare with a unique opportunity. With access to over 16 million \nemployees, the diversity and inclusion arena in healthcare is the largest forum in the country \nfor workers to grapple with the thorny issue of race and its intersections, including gender, \nsocio-economic status, and age. \nHealthcare policymakers, administrative heads, and clinical leaders no doubt realize \nthe enormous import of this work and the urgency of this historic moment. The goals of \ncreating a diverse, inclusive workforce and a more equitable, culturally competent healthcare \nsystem are now considered a major priority of healthcare delivery organizations (Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2017; Dreachslin et al., 2017). The Affordable \nCare Act (ACA), passed in 2010 and implemented by 2014, created numerous regulations to \n4 \n \n \n \nfurther the cause of diversity, equity, inclusion, and cultural competency. Hospital \nadministrators, physician leaders, and staff charged with meeting this challenge are seeing \nslow progress in some measures and declines in others (Institute for Diversity in Health \nManagement [IDHM], 2015; AHRQ, 2017; Diversity Best Practices, 2017). There is no \nreadily available national data regarding inclusion, sometimes known as ‘diversity climate,’ \nsave for data collected by individual healthcare institutions (Hofhuis et al., 2016; Aysola, \n2018; Brimhall and Mor Barak, 2018).  \nOn the diversity front, both the 2011 and 2015 data from the American Hospitals \nAssociation show that leaders identifying as White makeup 81% of front line managers, 85% \nof all C-Suite and board positions, and 91% of CEOs (IDHM, 2011, 2015). In contrast, in the \npatient population as a whole, non-Hispanic Whites comprise about 68% and in the US \npopulation, 61% identified as non-Hispanic White as of 2017 (IDHM, 2015; U.S. Census \nBureau, 2018). This overrepresentation of Whites and White males in particular, persists \ndespite, as the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) notes, ‘two decades of \nsuccess in attracting racially/ethnically diverse students to graduate studies in health \nadministration’ (2015). Leaders now recognize that while front-end recruitment is a \nnecessary precondition of more diverse representation, it is not sufficient. Rather, improving \ndiversity also relies upon retaining and developing leaders from underrepresented groups \nthrough promotion of more inclusive work environments (Aysola et al., 2018). The limited \nstudies of inclusion in the healthcare workplace are inconclusive (Diversity Best Practices, \n2017).  \nGiven the overrepresentation of White individuals in leadership and clinical \nprofessions, this is a critical audience for healthcare inclusion leaders. But Whites appear to \n5 \n \n \n \npose unique challenges to diversity work overall (McIntosh, 1988; Sue et al., 2010; \nDiAngelo, 2011) and there is evidence of Whites feeling excluded from inclusion efforts \n(Plaut, 2011; Shelton, 2013; Aysola et al., 2018). In a cross-industry study of 670 corporate \nleaders from 2012, 70% of White men and 60% of women and non-Whites were ‘not clear’ if \ndiversity and inclusion work were intended for White men (Shelton 2013). In another study \nof healthcare leaders, 73% of white respondents believe opportunities for non-White leaders \nin healthcare have improved over the previous five years, while only 34% of minorities share \nthat view (Witt/Keifer, 2015). This leads to the central research question of this capstone: \nhow can healthcare diversity and inclusion leaders effectively engaging White employees in \ncreating a more inclusive workplace? \nPersonal Interest \nI chose this capstone topic for personal and political reasons. On a personal level, race \nand racism have had a big impact on my life and how I see the world. I am a White, Jewish \nman with ancestry in Eastern Europe, Italy, and Denmark. I spent my weekends at my \nfather’s house in a mostly White suburb and my weekdays at my mother’s house in a West \nPhiladelphia neighborhood that was majority African American and working class or poor. \nFrom ages eight to 12, my best friend was my Black neighbor Omar and my first cultural \n‘home’ was Black and urban. My elementary schools were majority Black. As a result, I was \naware of my Whiteness from early childhood. In my multicultural neighborhood, we talked \nand joked about identity all the time. I am sure that people today might be offended or \nconfused by how freely we dealt with race. Looking back at that period, I was largely \nsuccessful in bridging the divisions of race and class, and I benefited handsomely for it.  \n6 \n \n \n \nThen, Omar moved away, I changed schools, and teenage social identities became \nstronger. I was assaulted two times by African American teens in my neighborhood whom I \ndid not know prior. After the worst assault, I struggled with intense fear and refused to leave \nthe house except for school for several weeks. For the remainder of my high school years, I \nlacked a cultural home and struggled to connect with any one group of people.  \nNow, as an adult once again living and working in West Philadelphia, I have made \nthe activist agenda of anti-racism central to my own healing work. In 2017, I joined a Parents \nAnti-Racism group in my neighborhood. In April 2018, I attended a White People \nConfronting Racism workshop with the activist organization Training for Change. I have \nworked on many issues of identity and oppression in my peer counseling network, Re-\nEvaluation Counseling. I have developed a few friendships and working relationships with \nPeople of Color. My life still feels segregated and I make plenty of mistakes that, I am \ncertain, reproduce racism at the interpersonal and institutional levels. Part of me is still \nreaching for the Omar of my youth and all the people I have wanted to connect with more, \nbut from whom I was separated by the circumstances of race, class, and other socialized \ndivisions.  \nAt the same time as my healing process has advanced, the national situation has also \nbrought these issues to the fore. Despite societal progress, the election results of 2016, the \nexposure of extra-judicial killings of black people, and rising White supremacy were a \npersonal wake-up call. These events demonstrated to me that a very large portion of White \npeople in the United States lack the opportunities that I have had to work on their position \nrelative to racism. Instead, it seemed many Whites saw racism as either nonexistent, not their \nfault, no concern to them, or even that racism was done to them. Others seemed to understand \n7 \n \n \n \ntheir responsibility in racist systems, but chose to invest their time in ‘helping’ people of \ncolor. These responses got me interested in how I could help White people understand their \nself-interest in ending racism and build skills to support one another to do so. \n  I am also a coach, a consultant, and a student of Organizational Dynamics in the \nfinal semester of a six-year journey to a (second) Master’s degree. As a Dynamics student, I \nview the work of increasing diversity and inclusion as a culture change project. In such a \nproject, leadership development, both at the senior level and throughout organizations, is \ncritical to achieving success. On a personal level, I see diversity and inclusion work as a \nhopeful forum to increase White awareness and provide opportunities to overcome racial \nbias. Professionally, I was drawn to the industry focus of healthcare by my ongoing \nprofessional relationship with a leader of clinical care and quality in neuro-critical care at \nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia.   \nLastly, as a citizen of the United States of America, my hope is that diversity and \ninclusion work can become more and more effective in creating opportunities for empathy, \ncivility, and racial justice, and thereby help our country redefine its ‘dream’ in the era of a \nnon-White majority. \nOverview of Key Literature \nThere is a limited amount of academic literature directly addressing this study’s \ncentral question: How can leaders effectively engage White people in healthcare workplace \ninclusion? However, I found salient material in two closely related issues: one (1), diversity \nmodels and diversity approaches and how they impact Whites and non-Whites and two (2), \nWhite racial identity and how it interacts with inclusion strategies. I then explored two \nillustrative case studies in healthcare workplace inclusion. Lastly, I explored orienting \n8 \n \n \n \ntheories at the interpersonal level - psychological safety and positive identity development, \nand at the organizational level - organizational culture change.  \nFrom the work of Plaut (2011) and Apfelbaum (2016), I found support for the \ncontention that White people’s encounter with workforce -based inclusion efforts is \nexceptional. They also found that this encounter can be managed with adjustments in \ndiversity approach, or the way in which diversity and inclusion are discussed. Successful \napproaches include using all-inclusive language explicitly calling out European ethnic \nidentity and showing equal support for the value to the organization of differences and the \nvalue of treating workers with equality.  \nScholars such as Helms (1995), McIntosh (1988) and Spanierman (2017) contend \nthat, due to their insider position relative to the dominant culture, White people have unique \nchallenges and opportunities vis-a-vis addressing racial inequality. The key takeaways for \nworkplace inclusion leaders is that there is a developmental process for Whites to achieve \nhigher levels of non-racist or ally-like behaviors. To reach these higher states, the experts in \nthis area counsel that White people need challenge and support in both intra-group and inter-\ngroup interactions. \nHolm’s (2017) report on the Privilege and Responsibility Curricular Exercise (PRCE) \nat Henry Ford Health describes an interpersonal intervention that helped employees \nunderstand and interrupt the abuses of social privilege in the healthcare workplace. The \nPRCE provided a unique opportunity for Whites and non-Whites to work toward racial \nequity, but the resulting write-up was entirely qualitative and lacked empirical data. In \ncontrast, Weech-Maldonado’s (2018) study on the national diversity demonstration project \nwas a rigorous two-year study of a comprehensive strategic intervention which tested both \n9 \n \n \n \ninterpersonal and organizational measures at two health systems. The intervention hospitals \nsaw improvements versus the control hospitals in diversity leadership representation, human \nresource management, and diversity climate. The Weech-Maldonado result that was directly \nrelated to the current study showed that White non-racist attitudes worsened from pre- to \npost-intervention assessments. \n Scholars such as Edmondson (2006) have shown that psychological safety at work \nenables learning and relationship-building. Since learning and relationships are central to \npromoting inclusivity, establishing psychological safety is key for inclusion leadership; this \nrecommendation is particularly apt for engaging White employees. Dutton (2010), Ely and \nRoberts (2006) and colleagues have shown that he positive development of identity at work \nallows the development of positive relationships, both intra-group and inter-group, which are \nessential to withstand the rigors of inclusion work. \n On the organizational level, Schein (2016) addresses culture change as a group \nlearning activity that challenges underlying assumptions and triggers fears about survival and \nlearning. Schein’s most relevant recommendations for leading culture change are knowing \nthe audience, providing a compelling vision, emphasize behavior change and not culture \nchange, and connecting change-related beliefs, values, and behavior to stabilize newly \nformed cultures. Hiatt and Creasey (2012)’s change methodology draws upon longitudinal \ndata regarding best practices in management of the ‘people side of change’. These scholar-\npractitioners’ work shows that executive sponsors are the most important role. Sponsor \neffectiveness depends on being active and visible throughout a change, building coalitions, \nand communicating directly to employees about the change. Regarding communications, \nHiatt and Creasey warn leaders to attend closely to both the senders and receivers of \n10 \n \n \n \ninformation – specifically, who they are and what they want to hear, based upon their self-\ninterest. Receivers want to hear business-related information from senior-most leaders and \nthey want to hear personal impact-related information from direct supervisors, ideally in a \ncoaching conversation. \nThe literature summarized above has several gaps when considering the subject of \neffective engagement of White people in workforce inclusion in healthcare organizations. \nThe work on diversity approach only considers how workforce inclusion is discussed, \nlacking emphasis on strategic frame (i.e. business case) or the content of actual interventions. \nThe work on White racial identity development has not received a proper treatment from a \nhealthcare organization perspective nor have the impacts of interventions designed with the \n‘Whiteness’ lens been studied. Since healthcare organizations need to create more diverse \nand inclusive workplaces and White employees comprise the majority of influential roles, \nthere is a need to explore the issues surrounding engagement of White employees in \nworkplace inclusion. Lastly, my review of independent, non-peer reviewed research revealed \nthat much of the work focused directly on the topic has been conducted outside the walls of \nacademia.   \nResearch Question and Goals \n The main research question of this capstone paper is, “How can healthcare leaders \neffectively engage White employees in workplace inclusion strategies?” Answering this \nquestion led me on an intellectual journey through multiple academic disciplines, across 30 \nyears of work in diversity and inclusion practice, and around adjacent subject areas. While it \nwould have been impossible to report back from each waypoint on this journey, I distilled \nthis immense body of learning into a few key topics. The key topics included diversity \n11 \n \n \n \napproach (how diversity and inclusion work is discussed), Whiteness and non-racist White \nidentity development, promising interpersonal and organizational strategies for engaging \nWhites, and workplace inclusion as a culture change project. \nIn answering the main question, my goal was to provide research-backed, timely, and \nactionable insights that would help practitioners effectively engage White leaders and \nemployees in workplace inclusion. While I was specifically interested in those practitioners \nfrom large healthcare delivery organizations, I also hoped that the paper would appeal to \nother industries. Regardless of the usefulness of the findings, another goal was to spark a \ndialogue about whether, and how, leaders of diversity and inclusion work should address \nissues of racism and White supremacy. Lastly, my research was conducted with future \ninvestigators in mind; I hope this work sparks follow-on scholarship from across the many \ndisciplines.  \nAssumptions and Biases \n My research was written with numerous assumptions and biases. The assumptions \nwere intentional in order to focus the scope and generate results that were timely and relevant \nto the audience. My biases were operating at an unconscious level. These assumptions and \nbiases guided both the inclusion and the exclusion of certain data. Given the importance of \napproaching the research ethically, I will state these assumptions and biases to make my \nconceptual filter as transparent as possible:  \n● My social identities formed an inescapable filter of assumptions about myself, the \nresearch process, how the interviewees saw me, and innumerable other issues. For \nexample, as a 42-year-old White man raised in a middle class household with prior \ntraining in sales, I reached out directly to esteemed healthcare leaders, sometimes \n12 \n \n \n \nwithout a warm reference, and assumed I would get a positive response. I identify as \nan activist and I am surrounded by activists in a highly left-wing neighborhood \ncommunity. Therefore, I assumed that the diversity and inclusion leaders with whom \nI spoke shared some of my basic social and political assumptions about the world. I \nsought to mitigate these biases by recruiting an advisor and reader with, what I \nguessed based on appearances and our personal interactions, were complementary \nsocial identities to my own.  \n● I am interested in the overall goal of ending racism and achieving greater racial \njustice in the United States. This speaks to my orientation towards the sometimes \ndivergent goals of the workplace inclusion agenda: business performance, \norganizational effectiveness, and social justice. While I believe strongly in \nperformance goals such as financial health and healthcare quality, thus my six-year \npursuit in a degree in Organizational Dynamics, my anchoring goal is social change at \nthe societal level. I believe that organizations fundamentally exist to serve the public \ninterest of the societies in which they operate and, most importantly, to serve the \ninterests of human beings as a whole. This bias caused me to create a goal of making \nthe execution of this project itself, to a reasonable extent, an anti-racist endeavor. I \nmitigated this bias by fully exploring the opposing frame of reference - one that \ncenters organizational interests - in the interpretation of the findings. \n● Related to the bias described above, I assume that the reader has a basic \nunderstanding of two core, interrelated issues of my subject: institutional racism in \nthe United States and health disparities. Therefore, in the text of the paper, I do not \ndelve deeply into the unprecedented impact of White supremacy, nor do I explore the \n13 \n \n \n \nparticular populations, pathologies, or quality of care issues associated with the health \ndisparity problem. I softened the impact of this assumption by providing the reader \nsome limited background information on these topics. For further background on \nthese issues, see the References. \n● I have a bias for being direct and I assume others are being direct as well. This bias \nemerged in a coaching conversation with my advisor. My directness is partly a \ncultural artifact of growing up in a ‘low-context’ culture (Hall 1976) in which ‘what \nyou see is what you get’. Also, as an activist, I enjoy the feeling of ‘speaking truth to \npower.’ As a former salesperson, my directness was a survival mechanism. I \nmitigated my directness bias in this research study by developing awareness through \nconversations with my advisor and other stakeholders. In addition, I asked my \nadvisor, reader, and a third diversity and inclusion expert to review my interview \nquestions before using them.  \n● I assume that, by combining the most important concepts from academic literature \nwith lessons from the field, this will result in useful guidance for current practitioners \nin large, healthcare delivery organizations. This assumption reminds me of the \nfamous caveat from the investment world: Past results does not dictate future \nperformance. As an academic project, my paper will adhere to the scholarly \northodoxy of gathering data from past experience in order to form future solutions. \nThe danger is that the newly-formed theories, largely rehashed from past experience, \nare ill-equipped or irrelevant to the inherently dynamic nature of reality. I mitigated \nthe academic bias of my paper by grounding the research in primary data gathered \nfrom current-day practitioners. My interviewing methodology included a statement \n14 \n \n \n \nencouraging interviewees to act as ‘participant-partners’ rather than subjects, inviting \nthem to stray from my agenda and generating more practical data. Lastly, to balance \nout the academic bias of the research, I included non-academic yet reputable sources \nin the Key Insights section.  \n● I had a bias for producing timely and relevant results to practitioners. This impacted \nthe extent to which my research explored the history of diversity and inclusion \npractice. My sense was that the dynamism of the topic and the dynamism of the \ncurrent historical moment deserved a treatment of the literature that shaded toward \nmore recent work. With my advisor, I established a general preference for literature \nthat was created in the last 20 years, while not excluding older work.   \nMethodology and Methods \nMy data collection strategy was designed to (1) gather relevant, valid, reliable \nprimary data from practitioners of workplace inclusion in a resource-efficient manner, (2) \nbuild positive relationships that would become an ongoing resource for further research, and \n(3) generate self-reflective, experiential data regarding the relationship between the topic and \nmy social identities. Based upon my goals for data collection, I chose the qualitative research \nmethodology of semi-structured interviews. \nFrom February 7 to April 8, 2019, I conducted 16 qualitative, semi-structured \ninterviews of healthcare inclusion leaders and expert consultants. The interviews averaged 62 \nminutes in length, were recorded, and generated over 250 pages of transcript data. Of the 16 \nparticipants, 12 were leaders in eight healthcare delivery organizations in the United States. \nThe remaining four participants were independent diversity & inclusion consultants or \nleaders of independent organizations with extensive experience working with healthcare \n15 \n \n \n \ndelivery organizations. The participants had to spend at least 30% of their time working on \ntheir responsibilities in promoting diversity and inclusion. I used a combination of purposive \nand convenience sampling techniques.  \nThe most common position type (9 of 16) was a senior or mid-senior faculty member \nat a medical center with multiple appointments and varying responsibilities in promoting \ndiversity and inclusion. I sought to compile a demographically diverse sample and therefore \nhad to independently assess the racial and gender makeup of the participants prior to our \ninterviews (See Table 1 below). These assessments were confirmed by 14 of the 16 \ninterviewees during their interviews and no interviewees disconfirmed the independent \nassessment.  \nTable 1: Participant Race and Gender (Independent Assessment by Interviewer), ordered by \nparticipant count (#) \nRace Gender # Percentage \nBlack/African American Women 5 31.3% \nBlack/African American Men 4 25.0% \nWhite Women 3 18.8% \nWhite Men 2 12.5% \nLatina Women 1 6.3% \nLatino Men 1 6.3% \n Total 16 100.0% \n  \nIn my outreach and in my interview introduction, I expressed my goal that the \ninterviewees would be “participant-partners”: they would contribute to and benefit from the \nresearch (See Appendix A: Interview Agenda). I used the participant-partner concept in the \ninterest of increasing equity and mutuality in the research relationship. I viewed the interview \nprocess as an organizational development intervention in which the thinking and behavior of \nworkplace inclusion practitioners would be influenced by the process itself.  \n16 \n \n \n \n After the interviews were complete, I reviewed the recordings, transcriptions, and \nhandwritten notes. Using this data, I listed the responses to each question, removing or \naltering all references to potentially identifying information. I analyzed the data as a whole to \ncompile thematic categories. Consistent with a Grounded approach, during the data analysis \nstage, I did not attempt to fit the data into preconceived theoretical frameworks (Creswell and \nPoth, 2017). Then, I assessed the connections between the data, the extant literature, and \norganizing theories. After the analysis phase, I assigned pseudonyms to the participants. \n A major limitation of the research methodology is that it did not include a formal \nempirical study. That is, I was not testing a specific hypothesis in regarding to the effective \nengagement of White people in workplace inclusion. I also did not compile a menu of \nstrategies and interventions from the academic literature and then seek feedback on this \nagenda from the participants, nor did I gather quantitative data. However, one goal of this \nhighly qualitative research is that it will form the foundation for a quantitative research in the \nfuture.  \nLanguage Usage \nMy use of language, particularly around social identities, was guided by prevailing \nnorms of social science research and my involvement in various communities working \ntoward racial equity. My word choices are guided by my intention to avoid reproducing \nlegacies of discrimination or exclusion. \nI used the following general guidelines from the writing center and diversity and \ninclusion offices of Hamilton College regarding the “Language of Difference”:  \n● Assume a wide audience \n● Include a rationale for your choice (see specific rationales below) \n17 \n \n \n \n● Use only the language that is necessary to the context - only mention difference when \nit is relevant \n● Avoid terms that evaluate \n● Use the appropriate degree of specificity; i.e. ‘Dominicans’ rather than ‘Hispanics.’ \n● Focus on people rather than on a method of categorization: ‘people with mental \nillness’ rather than ‘the mentally ill.’ \n● Avoid the term ‘minority’ if possible (Bowman et al, 2015) \nAdhering to APA, 6th edition style guidance, I capitalized racial identities such as \n‘Latino/a’, ‘Black’, and ‘White’, (2009, pp. 70–77). \n I use the phrases ‘non-White’ and ‘People of Color’ interchangeably. Per the \nguideline above, I used these phrases when appropriate and, when called for, I used more \nspecific words such as ‘Black’ when appropriate. Given that this research is focused on \npeople with White racial identity or who enjoy White privilege, I chose ‘non-White’ to \ndelineate those people that do not belong to this group. However, I was also aware of the \ndanger that, to some readers, using the phrase ‘non-White’ centers Whiteness and devalues \nthe diversity of the innumerable ethnic groups and nationalities whom do not experience \nWhite privilege. On the other hand, since my research dealt specifically with the set of \nadvantages, mind frames, and behaviors in the workplace associated with White privilege in \nthe US, I wanted to acknowledge the inherently political nature of this issue. Therefore, I use \nboth non-White and People of Color.1 2  \n                                                 \n1 There is also a robust debate regarding the use of ‘People of Color’ (Glover, 2016) \n2In the Re-Evaluation Counseling communities, a worldwide peer counseling organization of which I am a \nmember, we use the phrase, ‘People of the Global Majority’ (Re-evaluation Counseling, 2016). People of the \nGlobal Majority is used to connote the reality that people of non-European ethnicities are the majority, by a \nwide margin, of the worldwide population. I have chosen not to use ‘People of the Global Majority’ because I \nbelieved it may have caused an unnecessary distraction to the reader.  \n18 \n \n \n \nI use the word ‘United States’ and not the word ‘American’. I do not use ‘American’ \nbecause this word, while used ubiquitously to refer to people who live in the United States of \nAmerica, conflates the geographical designation of the Americas with a nationality \ndesignation of one country in that area (Kirk, 2013). \nI use gender terminology (cisgender woman, cisgender man, transgender) and sex \nterminology (male, female) separately. However, when I reference literature that mixed \ngender and sex, sometimes my usage also became mixed.  \nI created pseudonyms for each of the 16 participants using gender-neutral names and \nused the pronoun ‘they’ in order to secure their anonymity.  \nOutline of Capstone Paper \nThe goal of this capstone paper is to advance knowledge and practice of the effective \nengagement of White people in workplace inclusion strategies in healthcare organizations. I \npursue this goal by presenting the relevant knowledge on the issue, explaining my research \nmethodology, presenting the findings, and offering an interpretation of these findings.  \nIn chapter 2, I will present a review of academic literature in five sections. The first \nsection presents the situation facing healthcare leaders who are charged with promoting an \ninclusive workplace strategy. Secondly, I will define several key terms that are connected to \nthe research question, and in doing so provide general background to the current study. The \nthird section presents key academic literature in two themes and two case studies. The fourth \nsection presents helpful orienting theories for exploring this study’s focus area. The fifth and \nfinal section summarizes the chapter and identifies gaps in the literature. \n19 \n \n \n \nChapter 3 is an explanation of my research methodology. In this chapter, I will \ndiscuss the methodological approach of the study, the use of semi-structured interviews, \nsample selection, data analysis, and limitations of the methodology. \nIn chapter 4, I will present key findings from the primary research, which were \ngleaned from analyzing the data from 16 qualitative, semi-structured interviews of healthcare \ninclusion leaders and expert consultants. I present the critical data in the dominant themes \nthat emerged from a close reading of each interview transcript, using extensive verbatim \nquotes from the participants. \nChapter 5 provides an interpretation of the findings from interviews with 16 \nhealthcare leaders and consultants regarding the effective engagement of White people in \nworkplace inclusion strategies. The first section of the chapter is interpretation of the findings \nas bounded by the concepts presented in Chapter 2, the Literature Review. These bounded \ninterpretations include the sub-topics of response to the research, interpersonal strategies for \nWhite engagement, and organizational strategies for White engagement. The second section \npresents conclusions, which include a summary of interpretations, key insights for \npractitioners which includes non-academic sources of knowledge, and a personal reflection. \n  \n20 \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 2 \nLITERATURE REVIEW \n \nIntroduction \nThis review of academic literature will explicate relevant bodies of knowledge \nsurrounding the primary research question: How can healthcare leaders effectively engage \nWhite employees in workplace inclusion strategies? The review has five sections. The first \nsection presents the situation facing healthcare leaders who are charged with promoting an \ninclusive workplace strategy. Secondly, I define several key terms that are connected to the \nresearch question, and in doing so provide general background to the current study. The third \nsection presents key academic literature in two themes and two case studies. The fourth \nsection presents helpful orienting theories for exploring this study’s focus area. The fifth and \nfinal section summarizes the chapter and identifies gaps in the literature. \nIndustry Context \nThe industry focus for this study includes urban healthcare systems in the United \nStates, whether they are for-profit, nonprofit, academic, or nonacademic. All other sectors of \nthe US healthcare system such as private practices, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, are \nexcluded from this scope. The terms, “healthcare system,” “healthcare delivery networks,” \n“medical centers,” “hospitals,” “hospital systems,” “medical centers,” and the like will be \nused interchangeably.  \nAlong with rapid expansion, workforce shortages, and technology change, the \ncreation of a more diverse and inclusive healthcare workforce and a more equitable system \nare major priorities of healthcare delivery organizations located in the United States of \nAmerica (Dreachslin et al., 2017; Diversity Best Practices, 2017). The Affordable Care Act \n21 \n \n \n \n(ACA), passed in 2010 and implemented by 2014, created numerous mandates, including \nincreased diversity in the healthcare workforce, collection of diversity data, and investment \nin a culturally competent workforce (Diversity Best Practices, 2017). The ACA also created a \nNational Prevention Strategy (NPS), which created a framework for alignment of healthcare \nquality and health equity.  \nThe coming demographic shift in the United States from a White majority to a People \nof Color majority by 2045 is another source of pressure on healthcare providers to increase \ndiversity and inclusion measures (Parker, 2019). Already, the cohort of young people born in \n2007 or later are minority White (Frey, 2018). While the patient populations grows more \ndiverse racially and ethnically, healthcare leadership diversity lags. Both the 2011 and 2015 \nreports from the American Hospitals Association show that leaders identifying as White \nmake up 85% of all C-Suite and board positions and 91% of CEOs. In contrast, in the patient \npopulation as a whole, non-Hispanic Whites comprise about 68% and in the US population, \n61% identified as non-Hispanic White as of 2017 (Institute for Diversity in Health \nManagement [IDHM], 2017). Additionally, ‘controlling for education and years of \nexperience, black men continued to earn median salaries that were 17 percent less than white \nmen. Hispanic men earned 8 percent less and black women have moved from earning almost \nthe same median salary as white women in 2007 to earning 13 percent less’ (ACHE, 2015).  \nWhile the data is clear that greater diversity and equity in the healthcare leadership is \nan area of need, perceptions of this need differ between Whites and non-Whites. According \nto an independent survey of healthcare leaders, 73% of White respondents believe \nopportunities for diverse leaders have improved over the previous five years while 34% of \nnon-Whites agree (Witt/Keifer, 2015). Similarly, 67% of white respondents agree the \n22 \n \n \n \navailability of leadership positions for People of Color in healthcare organizations has \nimproved over the previous five years; only 30% percent of People of Color agree \n(Witt/Keifer, 2015). Not surprisingly, Weech-Maldonado (2018) reports that non-Hispanic \nWhite men have the highest ‘job satisfaction’ and perception of ‘opportunity in the \nworkplace’ (p. 31).  \nHospital administrators, physician leaders, and staff charged with meeting the \nregulatory mandate are seeing slow progress in some measures and declines in others \n(IDHM, 2017; AHRQ, 2017; Diversity Best Practices, 2017). There is no readily available \nnational data regarding inclusion, sometimes known as ‘diversity climate,’ save for data \ncollected by individual institutions (Hofhuis et al., 2016; Aysola, 2018; Brimhall and Mor \nBarak, 2018). Nevertheless, there is a growing chorus of support for rolling out \ncomprehensive diversity and inclusion strategies in healthcare workforce. This policy \nstatement of the American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) throws its support \nbehind  \n‘a commitment at all professional levels… within the organization through the \nawareness of diversity and inclusion issues, hiring practices that attract diverse staff, \ndevelopment and mentoring in educational programs and organizations, and \norganization-wide diversity and cultural competency training’ (2015). \n In this statement, the ACHE shows a growing recognition that a significant aspect of \nthe diversity pipeline challenge lies in medical centers’ ability to retain and develop leaders \nfrom underrepresented groups. For, the overrepresentation of Whites and White men in \nparticular persists despite, as the ACHE notes in its 2015 policy statement, ‘two decades of \nsuccess in attracting racially/ethnically diverse students to graduate studies in health \n23 \n \n \n \nadministration’.  Still, the number of People of Color medical student graduates is lagging. \nWhile comprising more than 30 percent of the U.S. population, Blacks and Latinos make up \nonly 10.3 percent of medical school graduates (Charles, 2019). In order to retain and develop \nclinical and administrative leaders from these groups, the industry is now shifting attention \nand investment into creating more inclusive and empowering work environments in \nhealthcare.  \nBut Whites appear to pose unique challenges to diversity work overall (McIntosh, \n1988; Sue et al., 2010; DiAngelo, 2011) and there is evidence of Whites feeling excluded \nfrom inclusion efforts (Plaut, 2011; Shelton, 2013; Aysola et al., 2018). In a cross-industry \nstudy of 670 corporate leaders from 2012, 70% of White men and 60% of women and non-\nWhites were ‘not clear’ if diversity and inclusion work were intended for White men \n(Shelton 2013). In another study of healthcare leaders, 73% of white respondents believed \nopportunities for non-White leaders in healthcare have improved over the previous five \nyears, while only 34% of minorities shared that view (Witt/Keifer, 2015). \nWhile no study has directly addressed the issue of engaging White employees in \nhealthcare diversity and inclusion work, there have been studies that provide crucial insight \nand context for this topic. For example, beginning in 2009 and concluding in December \n2013, Robert Weech-Maldonado of University of Alabama and Janice Dreachslin of Penn \nState led the National Center for Healthcare Leadership Diversity Demonstration project \n(Weech-Maldonado et al., 2018). In a similar time period, diversity leaders and consultants at \nHenry Ford Health System in Detroit rolled out their faculty and staff the Privilege and \nResponsibility Curricular Exercise [PRCE] (Holm et al., 2017). The Weech-Maldonado and \n24 \n \n \n \nHolm studies are explored further in the Illustrative Case Studies subsection under Review of \nExtant Literature.  \nDefinitions and Background \nIn US healthcare, the concept of inclusion is often linked together with the concepts \nof diversity, equity, health disparity, and cultural competence. However, these terms have \ndifferent meanings in different contexts to different audiences. The use of language is critical \nin workplace inclusion practice because different social identity groups have different \nreactions to the same words (Stevens et al., 2008; Plaut et al,. 2011). As a result, choosing the \nright communication strategy is a central challenge for practitioners. Therefore, defining the \nterms inclusion, diversity, equity, and cultural competence carries importance for both \nacademic research and practical applications in the field. Exploration of these definitions also \nprovides a general background to the current study, effective engagement of White people in \nworkplace inclusion. My definitions rely heavily on the work of University of Southern \nCalifornia social scientist Michelle Mor Barak.  \nInclusion \nTo Mor Barak, workplace inclusion is the extent to which employees, regardless of \nsocial identity or group affiliation, feel they are a part of the organizational system, \nboth in terms of formal processes like decision making and promotion and informal \nprocesses like ‘water cooler’ conversations (2016). Therefore, this concept of inclusion \nencompasses both the organizational policies and procedures that dictate inclusivity, \nadherence to those formal rules, and self-reported perceptions of inclusion by employees.3  \n                                                 \n3 The interplay of formal and informal inclusion measures is important to consider.  Some compliance-based \nstrategies have been shown to have a negative impact on actual inclusion practices (Madera and Hebl 2013). \n25 \n \n \n \nAnother way to assess inclusion is to assess the absence of its opposite, exclusion. \nThat is, to what extent does the combination of an organization’s formal rules and informal \ninterpersonal dynamics exclude people of various identities? Some researchers show that the \nfear of the pain of exclusion may be a fundamental driver toward seeking inclusion \n(Eisenberger et al., 2003). Further, the negative effects of interpersonal exclusion on job-\nrelated performance can be as significant as overt discriminatory practices (Thomas, 2008).  \nIn contrast to defining inclusion in terms of its opposite, positive organizational \nscholars define inclusion as the presence of genuine positive relationships that bridge \ndifferences between individuals (Davidson and James, 2006). These high-quality \nrelationships are central to building more inclusive culture because they allow workers to, as \nStevens and Plaut put it, ‘move beyond surface-level actions to actively incorporate diversity \ninto their work lives’ (2008, p.118). Genuine, positive relationships across difference provide \nthe basis for an individual employee to feel that all their social identities are welcome, \nresulting in a lived sense of greater authenticity at work. These high quality relationships also \nencourage ongoing learning and resilience in the face of identity-based conflict (Stevens et \nal., 2008). By making workplace inclusion central to the project of overall employee growth \nand engagement, positive organizational scholars seek to elevate the work of inclusion as a \nmission-critical management practice.  \nRather than pursuing a top-down approach to defining workplace inclusion, Jaya \nAysola’s (2018) research developed an operational definition of inclusion in the healthcare \ncontext using a grassroots approach by asking employees to define inclusion. Participants \nresponded in narrative format to two questions: (1) Can you think about a time when \n“you/them feel included, valued, and welcome, OR excluded, devalued, and unwelcome as a \n26 \n \n \n \nmember of [this organization]” and (2) “Please comment on your perception of the general \nclimate at the [organization] with regards to inclusion and respect” (Aysola et al., 2018). The \nresearchers’ analysis of participant narratives resulted in a taxonomy of inclusion had the \nfollowing themes:  \n● Presence of discrimination in both the interpersonal and institutional realms \n● The silent witness \n● The interplay between hierarchy, recognition, and civility \n● The effectiveness of leadership and mentors \n● Support for work-life balance \n● Perceptions of exclusion by inclusion efforts \nTherefore, for Aysola et al., an operational definition of inclusion in healthcare would \nconsider both the absence of exclusionary policies and practices and the presence of inclusive \nones. This duality highlights a central challenge of workplace inclusion - how can leaders \nimplement a strategy that maximizes inclusion for some social identities without generating \nexclusion for others? Given the range of diversity in social identities, nationalities, and \ncultures, particularly in large healthcare delivery networks in the US, it is critical to \nunderstand the concept of diversity and how it relates to inclusion. \nDiversity \nContemporary definitions of diversity attempt to reconcile the US-centric, narrow \nview with broader views that are more accepted by practitioners in global workplaces (Mor \nBarak, 2016, page 116-130). US-centric definitions have focused on promoting better \nrepresentation of, and protecting the rights of, groups that have experienced systematic \ndiscrimination based upon race, gender, sexual orientation, and the like. This definition of \n27 \n \n \n \ndiversity is connected to compliance with national Equal Employment Opportunity laws, first \ninstituted in the late 1960’s, and the concept of affirmative action. As a result, this usage of \ndiversity generally implies two separate groups of employees: those who have experienced \nnationally-recognized discrimination and those who have not (Mor Barak, 2016). \nPractitioners who adhere to this concept of diversity may refer to some groups of employees \nas diverse (e.g. Female, Latinx, GLBTQ) and others who are not (e.g. White & Male). The \nunstated goal of these US-based diversity programs is to increase the representation and \nretention of employees that are diverse. \nMeanwhile, global practitioners reject this US-based view as too narrow and \ncontextual. Globalists posit diversity as the presence of employees with innumerable \ncharacteristics, both immediately observable and not (Mor Barak, 2016, page 126). This \ndiversity allows for inclusion of features like ethnicity, nation of origin, religion, age, cultural \nbackground, rural/urban, and socio-economic background. Some scholars and practitioners \nhave extended this diversity concept further to include every employee in the organization \n(Thomas, 1992). In recent years, this all-inclusive view of diversity expanded even further to \ninclude the diverse ways that employees’ mental processes manifest at work. The diversity of \nthought concept has the advantage of speaking to the purported advantages for teams that \nharness more diverse perspectives (Reynolds and Lewis, 2017; Chamorro-Premuzic, 2017; \nFernandez, 2007).  \nHowever the globalist, broadly-defined diversity is rejected by some compliance- and \njustice-oriented practitioners as an unacceptable dilution of the term (Mor Barak, 2016). \nThey argue that the broad definition of diversity ignores historical and present-day \noppression, which reinforces employer behavior that colludes with a discriminatory socio-\n28 \n \n \n \neconomic system. Mor Barak resolves this conflict between the justice-oriented diversity and \nthe globalist diversity with a “both-and” definition:  \nWorkforce diversity refers to the division of the workforce into distinction categories \nthat: \n(a) Have a perceived commonality within a given cultural or national context, and \nthat \n(b) Impact potentially harmful or beneficial employment outcomes such as job \nopportunities, treatment in the workplace, and promotion prospects - \nirrespective of job-related skills and qualifications (2016, page 129) \nThis definition of diversity both presents a broad scope and includes the concept of harmful \noutcomes. Mor Barak’s definition focuses attention on the who and the why of diversity: \n“Who is workplace diversity for?”, and “Why is diversity important?” These concerns are \nalso central to an inter-group cultural diversity model as explicated by Robin Ely and Laura \nMorgan Roberts: “We define cultural diversity as differences among team members in race, \nethnicity, gender, religion, nationality, or other dimensions of social identity that are marked \nby a history of intergroup prejudice, discrimination, or oppression” (2008, page 175). Ely and \nRoberts’ probing of the who and the why of diversity is critical to the project of promoting an \ninclusive healthcare workplace because they direct attention towards the various senders and \nreceivers of communication and the impacts of the work. \nHealth Disparity and Health Equity \nA lack of diversity in healthcare leadership and health professions is considered a \nsignificant factor in ongoing health disparities in the US (Marrast et al., 2014). Carter-Pokras \nand Baquet (2002) define health disparity as ‘a chain of events signified by a difference in: \n29 \n \n \n \n(1) environment, (2) access to, utilization of, and quality of care, (3) health status, or (4) a \nparticular health outcome that deserves scrutiny’ (p. 427). This definition refers to the \nsystemic, holistic nature of the health disparity issue. The CDC, tracking the consensus \namong public health practitioners, goes beyond Carter-Pokras and Baquet’s disparity by \nintroducing the concept of fairness: health disparities are inequalities that represent \"unfair \nhealth differences closely linked with social, economic or environmental disadvantages that \nadversely affect groups of people\" (Centers for Disease Control, 2013). The AHRQ identifies \nthe following groups as “priority populations” for health equity research, policy, support, and \nfunding: women, children, the elderly, ethnic minorities, racial minorities, special needs \npopulation, urban or rural population as well as the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \n(LGBT) population (2019).  \nPromotion of health equity is presented as the antidote to health disparity. Braveman \nand Gruskin (2003) offer a succinct definition: “equity in health is the absence of systematic \ndisparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with \ndifferent levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantage—that is, wealth, power, or \nprestige” (p. 254). For healthcare delivery organizations, the inclusion of systematic, societal \ndisadvantage in the health equity concept justifies the expansion of their mission from the \npatient level to the broader social, economic, and political determinants of health in the US. \nCultural Competence \nThe National Quality Forum, the leading independent organization promoting health \nquality and equity, defines cultural competence as the health care systems’ ability to \nensure that “diverse patient populations receive high-quality care that is safe, patient \n30 \n \n \n \nand family centered, evidence based, and equitable” (National Quality Forum, 2009).4 \nHealthcare organizations are investing in cultural competence at many levels:  \n● diversifying their leadership and provider populations, \n● educating providers and staff on salient cultural features of their patient populations, \n● mainstreaming diversity content in medical education, \n● increasing their service level for non-English speakers, \n● training regarding societal privilege, \n● unconscious bias training, \n● engaging with community-based organizations and many other initiatives (Weech-\nMaldonado et al., 2018; Holm et al., 2017; Dreachslin et al., 2012; Aysola et al., 2018). \nTherefore, cultural competence is an integrative concept for the healthcare system that seeks \nto incorporate the goals of diversity, inclusion, and health equity. However, within the \ncontext of the healthcare workplace, cultural competence is just one factor, albeit a critical \none, in creating an inclusive healthcare workplace (Person et al., 2015).  \nWhite people \nThe persistent, severe health disparities between Whites and non-Whites in the US \nhealthcare system highlight the importance of leaders gaining a full understanding of the \nWhite racial identifier and Whiteness as a social construct. Despite the social power of \nWhiteness in present day US society, there is no biological basis supporting Whiteness and \nother racial categories (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 2003). More specifically, \nthere are no genetic differences between human beings beyond the superficial differences \n                                                 \n4 It is unclear how the NQF defines “diverse populations” in its definition of cultural competence. Per the \ndiscussion of diversity above, the term “diverse people” connotes that some people are diverse (e.g. \nunderrepresented minorities, historically disadvantaged groups) and some people are not (e.g. overrepresented \nand historically advantaged groups).  \n31 \n \n \n \nthat arose from environmental adaptation, such as skin color.5 In fact, geneticists have found \ngreater variability within “racial groups” than across them (Gannon and LiveScience, 2016).  \nWhiteness is a social construct that was created by Europeans, at the latest, in the \nearly 17th century within the context of their military and economic domination of non-\nEuropean people in Africa, Asia, and the Americas (Painter, 2011; Lipsitz, 2018).6 The \nconcepts of Whiteness, White supremacy, race, and the racial inferiority of non-Whites \ndeveloped to explain the systems of domination designed to extract value from land, labor \nand other resources from non-Whites (Lipsitz, 2018; Coates, 2015; Hall 1995). The \ncolonizing societies created Whiteness and ascribed to it a certain set of phenotype-based \n(particularly skin color), ethnic, religious, and other characteristics to the colonized people in \norder to explain, communicate, and reinforce economic, political, and social domination.  \nBy the time of the first US census in 1790, the Census Bureau had three racial \ndesignations: (1) Free White males, free White females (2) All other free persons, and (3) \nSlaves (Pew Research Center, 2015). It is interesting to note that, in the first census, White \nwas the only race named.7 Thirty years later the word ‘colored’ appeared in the 1820 census \nand then, in the 1850 census, ‘Black’ and ‘Mulatto’. In 1960, all racial designation became \nself-reported, whereas in the past, the census taker would assign race. In 2000, US census \nsubjects were allowed to designate two or more races. In 2010, Hispanic was separated from \n                                                 \n5 Despite the extensive evidence debunking a biological basis for racial designations, the scientific argument for \nracism persists. See the New York Times article from January 5, 2019, ‘White Supremacy, Genetics, and Dr. \nJames Watson’ (Charlton and Harmon, 2019). \n6 According to (Simon, 2017), the written origins of the phrase ‘White people’ can be traced to October 29, \n1613, when the English playwright Thomas Middleton’s The Triumphs of Truth was first performed. The \nAfrican king character (likely played by an Englishman) looked out upon the English audience and declared: “I \nsee amazement set upon the faces/Of these White people, wond’rings and strange gazes.”   \n7 ‘Slaves’ included the relatively small numbers of non-African slaves present in the country at the time (Pew \nResearch Center, 2015).  \n32 \n \n \n \nRace as a category, allowing for dual designation of Hispanic and White or Hispanic and \nnon-White. In the 220 years from 1790 up until 2010, all census forms have placed White at \nthe top of the list (Pew Research Center, 2015).  \nAccording to US Census estimates for 2017, approximately 76.6% of the US \npopulation identified as “White only” or “White and Hispanic”, while 61% identified as \nWhite only (U.S. Census Bureau 2018). In large, US healthcare delivery networks, White \npeople make up the vast majority of senior leadership positions (IDHM, 2017). The most \nrecent data from the American Hospitals Association shows that Whites make up 85% of all \nC-Suite and board positions and 91% of CEOs. First- and mid-level managers are 81% White \non average. In the healthcare workforce as a whole, depending on geography, White people \nmake up between 65% and 90% of doctors, nurses, and technical professions (Valentine et \nal., 2016; IDHM, 2017). Meanwhile, patient populations better reflect the diversity of the US \npopulation as a whole, with non-Hispanic Whites making up about 68%. Therefore, Whites \nare disproportionately represented in positions of power and influence in the present-day US \nhealthcare system.  \nEngagement \n This study uses a general conception of engagement and not the human resources \nconcept of employee engagement. Merriam Webster’s definition of the verb, to engage is \napt: to offer something as backing to a cause or aim (2019). Using this definition, \nengagement in workplace inclusion would be: the extent to which employees offer their \nbacking to the workplace inclusion effort. Because workplace inclusion strategies can \ncomprise a variety of goals, strategies, and tactics, engagement translates to a variety of \nbehaviors. These behaviors could include listening, learning, attending a webinar, voicing a \n33 \n \n \n \nquestion or concern, joining a committee, paying for food and beverage at an event, creating \na new position, or incorporating a recommended action into their work practices.  \nReview of Extant Literature \nThere is a limited amount of academic literature directly addressing this study’s \ncentral question: How can leaders effectively engage White people in healthcare workplace \ninclusion? However, scholars have explored two related issues: one (1), diversity \nmodels/diversity approaches and how they impact Whites and People of Color and two (2), \nWhite racial identity and how it interacts with inclusion strategies. In this literature review, I \nexplore each of these topics in turn and review two case studies of action-research in \nhealthcare diversity and inclusion - one intervention at the interpersonal level and one at the \norganizational level.  \nDiversity Models and Diversity Approaches \n Victoria C. Plaut led or co-authored numerous studies on White perceptions of \nworkplace diversity & inclusion during the 2000s, published a meta-report in 2011, and has \nparticipated in prior and subsequent scholarship, such as Stevens et al. (2008, 2009), \nMorrison et al. (2010, 2011), and Downey et al. (2015). Plaut’s (2011) report provided a \ndetailed view of five studies that explored White reactions to two dominant diversity models, \n‘colorblindness’ and multiculturalism, and their perception of inclusion in diversity \nstrategies. These varying approaches echo Mor Barak’s description of the contrasting \ndefinitions of diversity itself described above: the narrower, power-informed, social justice \ndiversity and a more globalist and organizational diversity. Plaut’s findings showed that  \n● White’s perceptions of diversity models are different than those of non-Whites, \n● Whites’ perception of diversity can be managed with adjustments in messaging, and  \n34 \n \n \n \n● Active management of language that is inclusive of White group-level identities is \ndesirable for diversity efforts and the organization as a whole (2011, page 349).  \nIn Study 1, Plaut et al administered a custom-designed implicit association test (IAT) \nto 39 multiracial undergraduate students designed to test their association between typical \nmulticultural or colorblind messages and inclusion versus exclusion. The results showed \n“Whites showed a significant bias for pairing a traditional conception of multiculturalism \nwith exclusion (and colorblindness with inclusion). For minorities, there was no significant \ndifference” (2011, page 341)8.  \nIn Study 2, the researchers used the previous results to test the impact of a new ‘all-\ninclusive multiculturalism,’ (AIM) which explicitly includes European Americans in the \nmulticultural project, on 35 White undergraduate students (Plaut, 2011, p. 342; Stevens et al., \n2008). The control subjects who were primed with the legacy concept of multiculturalism \nwere significantly quicker to associate multiculturalism with exclusion compared to the \nsubjects who were primed with multiculturalism language that included European \nAmericans. Thus, “Study 2 provides insight into how a subtle change in the framing of \nmulticulturalism can make a significant difference” (p. 343).  \nPlaut’s Study 3 revisited Study 1’s associations with traditional multiculturalism \n(lacking explicit inclusion of Whites) and colorblindness. This time, 53 multiracial \nundergraduates responded to different diversity messages by pressing the key for “Me” or \n“Not Me”. In addition, participants were asked to what extent they agreed with diversity \nmessages regarding the University community. The results supported the hypothesis that \nWhite associated either diversity message with “Me” less than people of color, especially \n                                                 \n8 The researchers controlled for social desirability using Crowne and Marlowe’s abbreviated 8-item scale. \n35 \n \n \n \nwith the multicultural messaging (Plaut, 2011, p. 344)9. And, most significantly for \nestablishing the link between endorsing diversity strategies, the more participants associated \n“Me” with multiculturalism, the stronger they endorsed diversity concepts in higher \neducation (p. 345).  \nPlaut et al’s Study 4 extended the University-based studies to a large healthcare \norganization context and focused the analysis on White men and men of color. As before, \ngroup status predicted diversity endorsement and feeling included in organizational diversity. \nHowever, even when controlling for group status, “perceptions of inclusion was still a \nsignificant predictor of diversity endorsement” (p. 346). Therefore, Study 4 supported the \ncontention that the observed difference in diversity endorsement between Whites and non-\nWhites can be explained in part by different perceptions of inclusion in diversity strategies. \nLastly, Study 5 sampled White male business school students’ ratings of organizational \nattractiveness (stated desire to work there) given either colorblind or multiculturalist \nmessages together with the individuals’ need to belong (NTB) rating.10 The results showed \nthat White men with higher NTB preferred organizations that expressed colorblind attitudes \ntoward diversity (p. 348). This lends support to the overall notion that White’s lower support \nfor diversity strategies is due in part to perceptions of being included in those strategies.11  \n                                                 \n9 The proportion of White participants associating multiculturalism with “Me” was 0.46 vs. people of color at \n0.84 (p. 343) \n10 An example of a need to belong statement was, “It bothers me a great deal when I am not included in other \npeople’s plans” (Plaut, 2011, page 347). \n11 Independent, non-academic research has corroborated White’s perception of exclusion from diversity and \ninclusion efforts. In the White Men’s Leading Through Diversity & Inclusion Study, a cross-industry study of \n670 corporate leaders from 2012, 70% of White men and 60% of women and non-Whites were ‘not clear’ if \ndiversity and inclusion work were intended for White men (Shelton, 2013). In another study of healthcare \nleaders, 73% of white respondents believe opportunities for non-White leaders in healthcare have improved \nover the previous five years, while only 34% of minorities share that view (Witt/Keifer, 2015).  \n36 \n \n \n \nTaken together, Plaut’s work represents foundational scholarship in the study of the \ninclusiveness of diversity messaging and it’s impact on people with White racial identity. \nEach study demonstrated support for hypotheses using rigorous social science procedures \nand quantitative data analysis. However, there are several factors that may weaken the \ngeneralizability of the results. Regarding the overall methodology, using the IAT method has \nbeen criticized for lack of test retest reliability (Rae and Olson, 2018; Erwin, 2007). That is, \nthe speed with which participants associate concepts seems to change significantly from one \ntest to the next.  \nOn a study-by-study basis, there are weaknesses to Plaut’s work. Study 1 showed that \nWhites were faster at pairing traditional multicultural words with exclusion than inclusion. \nBut this result does not exclude the fact that White participants paired multiculturalism with \nboth inclusion and exclusion, no matter how fast their implicit associations. The same can be \nsaid for people of color in the study - they also associated multiculturalism with both \ninclusion and exclusion. In addition, while it is a helpful finding that Whites had significantly \nhigher implicit preference for color blindness, this says nothing about connections between \nthose individuals’ implicit bias and ‘evaluative biases’, otherwise known as prejudicial \nbeliefs (Greenwald et al., 2002; Amodio and Devine, 2006).12 Finally, pertaining to Plaut’s \nfinding on White diversity endorsement, it is important to note that stated endorsement of \nworkplace inclusion strategies is but one measure of engagement and is not a predictor of \n                                                 \n12 As Amodio and Devine demonstrate in a series of behavioral studies, ‘implicit stereotyping processes are \npredictive of instrumental forms of race-biased behavior, whereas implicit evaluative processes are predictive of \nconsummatory forms of race-biased behavior’ (2006, p. 659). The researchers argue this difference is seen \nbecause implicit bias is associated with emotional centers of the brain whereas evaluative bias is associated with \ncognition. \n37 \n \n \n \nbehavior. Similarly, increased awareness of bias does not necessarily impact changing \nprejudicial behavior (Devine et al. 2012). \n A logical enhancement of Plaut’s work is to connect attitudes toward diversity \napproaches and the impact on behavior for Whites and non-Whites. The work of Evan P. \nApfelbaum does just this in a series of experiments wherein participants are given \nchallenging tasks after exposure to differing diversity approaches. In addition to linking \ndiversity approach to behavior, Apfelbaum’s work explores whether ‘social groups’ \nnumerical representation in an organization, in absolute terms as compared with the majority \ngroup (typically, White men), is one critical factor that influences whether a diversity \napproach that highlights differences is helpful or harmful’ (Apfelbaum et al., 2016, p. 547). \nThe researcher’s five studies support the overall idea that diversity approaches must be \ntailored to fit each organization’s unique situation regarding its relative numerical \nrepresentation of various non-dominant groups.  \nLike Plaut, Apfelbaum focuses on how diversity & inclusion work is presented and \nmessaged. While Plaut used the models colorblindness, multiculturalism, and all-inclusive \nmulticulturalism, Apfelbaum focuses on diversity approach, which is ‘how diversity and \nsocial group differences are discussed’ (2016, p. 547). A critical insight is that diversity \napproaches ‘provide a blueprint for intergroup processes and relations at work’ (p. 547). The \nscholars theorize that diversity approach has a significant impact on non-dominant groups \ndue in part to their ‘representation-based concerns’, or how strongly individuals feel they are \nrepresentative of their group and therefore will be evaluated based upon this membership (p. \n548). Apfelbaum hypothesizes that representation-based concerns, while seeded in society-\nlevel experiences, are stimulated in the workplace by numerical inferiority. Representation-\n38 \n \n \n \nbased concerns are a critical factor in feelings of marginalization and general disengagement \nfor non-dominant groups. His studies establish differences in representation-based concerns \nand expected numerical inferiority, and evaluate the impact of two diversity approaches, \n‘value in equality’ and ‘value in difference’, on the ‘performance and persistence’ of Black \nwomen and men and White women in carrying out work-like tasks (p. 548). Here are \nApfelbaum’s definitions of the two approaches:  \n● ‘A value in equality approach affirms that group membership will not be an obstacle \nto career opportunities and advancement, and that all employees are judged equally \nand fairly based on their skills, qualifications, and effort’ (p. 548) \n●  ‘A value in difference approach advocates for the importance of creating a workplace \nenvironment that appreciates (and is inclusive of) social group differences’ (p. 548). \nApfelbaum et al.’s five studies found support for their hypotheses. Study 1 showed \nthat, when imagining employment at ‘Redstone’ - a fictional professional services firm - \nBlack women and men possessed greater representation-based concerns than Whites (p. 549). \nAll participants predicted that Black men and women were the smaller minority than White \nwomen. In Study 2, White women performed better and more persistently on the tasks after \nreviewing a value in difference approach to diversity, whereas Black women and men \nperformed marginally better given the value in equality approach (2016, p. 551). In Study 3, \nafter reducing the positivity of Redstone’s diversity statement and increasing emphasis on \n‘race’ and ‘gender’, Black women and men still showed the greatest concerns about \nrepresentation. More significantly for the current study, Apfelbaum found that “for White \nparticipants, the value in difference approach led to better performance and greater \npersistence than the value in equality approach” whereas Blacks performed better with the \n39 \n \n \n \nvalue in equality approach (p. 553). Studies 4 and 5 further supported the hypothesis that \nnumerical representation influenced which diversity approach would help performance of \nnondominant groups the most13. \nApfelbaum’s work illustrates the difficult balancing act for designers of workplace \ninclusion strategies. Since Whites (and White men in particular) tend to be the dominant \ngroup in many work settings, their representation concerns are low and therefore the value in \ndifference approach is preferred. The opposite is usually true for Blacks, whose \nrepresentation concerns are higher and therefore prefer the value in equality approach. This \ninsight about minority representation is critical not only for tailoring today’s diversity \napproaches in White man-dominated workplaces, but also has implications for workplaces \nwherein previously marginalized groups become the majority.  \nApfelbaum work implies that a ‘both-and’ diversity approach may be preferred for \nengaging both dominant and non-dominant groups. In addition, this work also lends credence \nto theory that merely increasing the representation of groups is insufficient to achieve \nsustainable gains for non-dominant groups (2016, p. 562). Rather, based upon this research, \ninterventions that both increase representation and create an inclusive culture that alleviates \nthe representation-based concerns (or ‘stereotype threat level’) of non-dominant groups is \npreferred. Lastly, Apfelbaum’s work supports the scholarly argument for heightened concern \nfor heterogeneity and asymmetry of stigmatized groups’ needs in facing workplace \n                                                 \n13 Study 4 introduced this statement to test the hypothesis that perceived representation mediates which \napproach will help performance: “You are among [5%/40%] of employees at Redstone who are [racial \nminorities/women]” (Apfelbaum 2016, p. 555). When presented with the 5% condition, all groups showed \nbetter performance on the tasks with the value in equality approach; when presented with the 40% condition, \nthey performed better with the value in difference approach (2016, p. 556). Finally, in Study 5, Apfelbaum’s \nteam analyzed public diversity statements and attrition rates of women and racial minorities versus dominant \ntheir respective groups at 151 law firms in 2011. They observed that “when firms’ emphasis on the value in \ndifference approach was high, there were lower rates of attrition of women, whereas when firms’ emphasis on \nthe value in equality approach was high, there were lower rates of attrition of racial minorities” (p. 556). \n40 \n \n \n \nchallenges (Ely et al., 2012). One limitation of the work is the fictional workplace context - \nan elite professional services organization - differs significantly from large hospital systems, \nwhich is the focus of the current study. This factor reduces the applicability of Apfelbaum’s \nfindings.  \nWhite Racial Identity: Privilege, Fragility, Positive Identity Development, and Allyship \n Plaut and Apfelbaum’s work is illustrative of an organizational management \nperspective on the asymmetrical needs and dialectical concerns of Whites and non-Whites \ninvolved in workplace inclusion strategies. In their focus on the condition of White racial \nidentity in the workplace, management scholars show influences from a separate stream of \nsocial science called Whiteness studies. Whiteness scholars are largely trained in education \nand adult learning, sociology, or psychology. Eschewing a power-neutral, primarily \ninterpersonal view of racism, ‘Whiteness scholars define racism as encompassing economic, \npolitical, social, and cultural structures, actions,  and  beliefs  that  systematize  and  \nperpetuate  an  unequal  distribution  of privileges, resources and power between White \npeople and people of color’ (DiAngelo, 2011, p. 56). Whiteness theorists such as Helms \n(1990, 1995), Frankenberg (1993), and Dyer (1997) showed how Whiteness is not just a \nracial identity or designation, but rather is a social process, a location of race privilege, and a \nset of cultural practices.  \nWhite privilege has become a shorthand for White people’s preferred status in US \nlegal, political, economic and social systems at the expense of non-Whites (McIntosh, 1988; \nDiAngelo, 2011; Lipsitz, 2018). White privilege ‘lives’ in laws, policies, and social practices, \nand it is enacted as patterns of thought and action, both for Whites and non-Whites. One of \nthe most essential parts of White privilege and Whiteness is that they remained unexamined, \n41 \n \n \n \nboth by White people and people of color (McIntosh, 1988; Helms, 1990; Painter, 2011; \nBazelon, 2018).14  \nRobin DiAngelo’s work in the 2000’s built on this conception and explicated how \nWhiteness plays out in the realm of workplace diversity and inclusion efforts. DiAngelo’s \n2011 article White Fragility (and 2018 book of the same name), sums up her findings \nregarding White people’s hair trigger when exposed to racial stress, which results in ‘a range \nof defensive moves’: outward display of emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt, and \nbehaviors such as argumentation, silence, and leaving the stress-inducing situation’ (p. 57). \nWhite ‘fragility’, or lack of ‘racial stamina’, develops from early childhood as a result of  \n● segregation (locational, representational, and informational),  \n● being centered in society as objective, normal, individual, and universal \n● entitlement to racial comfort \n● racial arrogance (strong positive image of Whiteness vs. others) \n● racial belonging (internalized through US mainstream cultural representation) \n● psychic freedom from the social burden of race, and \n● general, ‘constant’ messages of White supremacy (pps. 58-63). \nDiAngelo notes that, rather than directly address racism and White privilege, \neducational efforts tend to ‘reproduce the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are \nwhat “they” have, not us [White people] through coded language’ (p. 55). She goes on to \npoint out that when trainers allow White privilege to ‘[remain] unnamed and explicitly \ndenied’ in diversity education, this reinforces the very dynamics that create the need for such \ntraining (p. 64). However, when faced with reality of racial discrimination or White \n                                                 \n14 The events surrounding the 2016 election cycle have pushed the issue of Whiteness into the public domain, \nwhich both created opportunities for learning and exacerbated tensions (Bazelon, 2018; Ross et al., 2018). \n42 \n \n \n \nsupremacy, this will often ‘trigger patterns of confusion, defensiveness, and righteous \nindignation’ (p. 64)15 Meanwhile, well-meaning Whites who position themselves as tolerant \nliberals employ tactics such as self-defense, which conflates the mere statement of racist \nreality with an ad hominem attack, or victimization, which equates their emotional \ndiscomfort with the truly deadly impacts of racism on people of color (pps. 64-65). Both \nreactions allow the individual to avoid responsibility for engaging in behaviors that will alter \nWhite racial privilege. Ultimately, DiAngelo’s prescription for ‘White fragility’ is for Whites \nto build up their racial tolerance by building ‘the stamina to sustain conscious and explicit \nengagement with race’ (p. 66). In this way, Whites can participant in an anti-racist agenda, \nthe goal of which ‘is to generate the development of perspectives and skills that enable all \npeople, regardless of racial location, to be active initiators of change (p. 66). However, \nDiAngelo joins fellow anti-racist theorists (Helms, 1990; Hooks, 1995; Derman-Sparks and \nPhillips, 1997) and activists in asserting, ‘White racism is ultimately a White problem and the \nburden for interrupting it belongs to White people’ (p. 66). \nDiAngelo’s assertion that White people have a primary responsibility for addressing \nracism and improving racial equity stands in stark contrast to many current approaches to \nworkplace diversity and inclusion. This contrast represents the ongoing ‘discursive’ conflict \nbetween the goals of ‘social justice,’ which include ending race-based oppression writ large, \nand goals of organizational performance (Mease, 2016). These divergent goals impact the \nscholarship and practice of workplace inclusion. While social justice-oriented practitioners of \nworkplace inclusion may insist upon directly addressing Whiteness in order to reduce its \npervasive, if unintentional, cultural impact, leaders and managers assiduously avoid using \n                                                 \n15 See also Kidder et al. 2004 and Sue et al. 2010 for examples of White reactions to racial subject matter. \n43 \n \n \n \nwords and concepts that link White employees to the ongoing causes of racial inequity \n(Mease, 2016). Therefore, diversity leaders can be informed by the social justice lens but, \nbound by the business imperatives and normative standards of workplace conduct, may be \nunable to use direct language to help Whites ‘build up racial tolerance’. This paradox \nrepresents a major practical limitation of DiAngelo’s work for practitioners of workplace \ninclusion. Another weakness of this article is that, while it draws on empirical studies, \nDiAngelo does not offer an agenda for empirical research going forward.  \n Whiteness scholars developed another critical idea for exploring the effective \nengagement of White people in workplace inclusion: the development of positive, non-racist, \nWhite racial identity. The Helms White Identity Model (1990, 1995) shows how a ‘healthy \nWhite identity’ transcends individual, institutional, and cultural racism by two processes: \n‘abandonment of racism and the development of a non-racist White identity’ (Helms, 1990, \np. 49). These two major phases are further broken down into the six (6) stages shown in \nTables 2 and 3 below. Helms used this developmental model to create the White Racial \nIdentity Attitude Scale (WRIAS) to measure the degree to which a White person has \nincorporated a non-racist perspective on their identity. The WRIAS scale was used by Robert \nWeech-Maldonado in the National Center for Healthcare Leadership Diversity \nDemonstration project, which is presented later in chapter 2.  \n  \n44 \n \n \n \nTable 2: Abandoning Racism Phase, Helms’ (1990) White Racial Identity Development \nModel using ‘People of Color (POC)’ in place of ‘Black’16   \nPhase Stage Description of cognition, emotion, behavior \nAbandoning \nRacism \nContact -Initial encounters Whiteness, People of Color-ness \n-Unaware, or superficially aware of being White \n-‘benefits from...racism without necessarily being aware that \nhe or she is doing so’ (p. 55) \n-Typical statement: ‘I don’t notice race’ (p. 57) \n-Expected positive self-esteem due to lack of dissonance \nDisintegration -Growing awareness of racism, White privilege and ‘moral \ndilemmas’ of being White’ causes cognitive and emotional \ndissonance (p. 58) \n-Examples of dissonant concepts: being moral yet treating \nPOC as such results in exclusion by Whites, believing in \nfreedom versus reality of racial inequality; belief in \nindividual merit versus ‘treating [POC] as a group with \nregard to individual merit’ (p. 58) \n-In order to avoid dissonance, Whites may retreat to denial \nby ‘selectively attend[ing] to only information that gives \nhim or her greater confidence...’ (p. 59) \n-’To the extent that cross-racial interaction is unavoidable, \nthe White person will attempt to develop new beliefs’ (pps. \n59 -60) \nReintegration -Conscious acknowledgement of White identity and, ‘in the \nabsence of contradictory experiences,’ accepts belief in \nWhite racial superiority because ‘he or she has earned such \nprivileges and preferences’ (p. 60)  \n-Guilt & anxiety turn into fear and anger, although mostly \n‘lie just beneath the surface’ waiting to be triggered (P. 60) \n-Behavior can be passive or active; most express passively, \nunless personal or societal conditions spark re-stimulation \n-Passive = avoid physically or mentally; Active = treating \nPOC with inferiority, shaming, physical harm \n \n  \n                                                 \n16 See Language Notes in chapter 3, Methodology for a brief justification for usage of People of Color. \n45 \n \n \n \nTable 3: Defining Non-racist White Identity Phase, Helms’ (1990) White Racial Identity \nDevelopment Model using ‘People of Color’ (POC) in place of ‘Black’ \nPhase Stage Description of cognition, emotion, behavior \nDefining \nNon-racist \nWhite \nIdentity                                                                                                                              \nPseudo- \nindependent  \n-Actively question the proposition that POC are inferior \n-Begin to acknowledge responsibility for ‘wittingly and \nunwittingly’ perpetuating racism (p.61) \n-Pseudo-independent is primarily intellectualizing phase \nwhere Whites ‘submerge tumultuous feelings’ (p.61) \n-Despite abandoning belief in supremacy, behavior will still \nbehave in ways that ‘unwittingly’ perpetuate racism (p.61) \n-Behavior of seeking interaction with POC, but with a \n‘helping’ mode seeking assimilation from POC (p.62) \n-Expressing disdain for racism while devoting attention to \nhelping POC without facing other Whites                                                                                                \nImmersion -Searching for redefinition: “Who am I racially?” and “Who \ndo I want to be?” (p.62) \n-Seeks role models of Whites who fought racism \n-Changing POC is no longer the focus, but starts to consider \nhow to confront White behaviors \n-Possibility for healing from old emotional wounds \n-Once these old feelings are expressed, White person may \nfeel ‘euphoria,’ which supports ‘newly developing identity’ \nand taking action on racism \n-Can see Whiteness as something other than oppressor \nAutonomy -Seeking to fully internalize non-racist White identity \n-No longer feels the needs to ‘oppress or idealize’ POC \nbecause race is no longer a threat or sanctuary (p.66) \n-Actively seeks to learn from other cultural groups \n-Learning about intersection with sexism, other -isms \n-Still there will be instances of behavior that reinforce \ninstitutional and personal racism, but will be aware \n-Conscious use of privilege and willingness to take action \n \n         Helms and her colleagues’ work on positive identity development laid the groundwork \nfor the concept of White allyship. Tatum (2003)’s straightforward definition of the White ally \nis ‘a White person who understands that it is possible to use one’s privilege to create more \nequitable systems; that there are White people throughout history who have done exactly \n46 \n \n \n \nthat; and that one can align oneself with that history’ (p. 37). In 2017, the contemporary \nWhiteness scholars Lisa B. Spanierman and Lisa Smith built considerably on the ally \nconcept. Spanierman and Smith’s eight-article study explores numerous dimensions of White \nallyship (The Counseling Psychologist: Volume 45 Issue 5, July 2017). Spanierman’s \n‘aspirational’ definition of White allyship as \n● demonstrating nuanced understanding of institutional racism and White privilege; \n● enacting a continual process of self-reflection about their own racism and positionality; \n● expressing a sense of responsibility and commitment to using their racial privilege in \nways that promote equity; \n● engaging in actions to disrupt racism and the status quo on micro and macro levels; \n● participates in coalition building and work in solidarity with people of color; and in the \nprocess,  \n● encountering resistance from other White individuals (p. 608-609). \nDespite the usefulness of White allyship, Spanierman and Smith, echoing founding \nscholar of multiculturalist psychology Derald Wing Sue and others, add the caveat that \n‘regardless of their commitment and dedication to racial justice, White individuals likely \ncannot completely purge the impact of racist socialization’ (2017, p. 609). Moreover, the \ncreation of a White ally identity has created numerous pitfalls connected to ‘the paternalistic \nmeme of White individuals as saviors of people of color’ (p.609). Spanierman and Smith go \non to enumerate these pitfalls and offer context and a path forward for avoiding them. The \nscholars’ and their colleagues’ narrow focus White allyship is both the strength and weakness \nof the work. The strength is that the issue is fully explored within the context of counseling \npsychology. The weakness is the lack of relevance of this highly refined, idealized view of \n47 \n \n \n \nallyship to practitioners of workplace inclusion in healthcare. I surmise that, due to their \nprofessional training, counseling psychologists display greater levels of social awareness and \ngreater levels of self-reflection from the typical hospital workplace.  \nEven so, White allyship offers individuals with White privilege a positive identity and \nset of behaviors with which to address racial inequity. Moreover, the concept of allyship in \ngeneral enables workplace inclusion leaders to put forth a positive vision for engaging \ndominant or non-marginalized groups in creating an inclusive culture.  \nIllustrative Healthcare Workplace Interventions   \nWhile empirical studies of workforce inclusion strategies in healthcare are scant, \nthere are two that have relevant findings for the current study of effective engagement of \nWhite people in workplace inclusion. The articles by Robert Weech-Maldonado and Amanda \nHolm describe two studies that illustrate two interventions, one at the organizational change \nlevel and one at the interpersonal level, that provide a helpful context for the issue of \nengaging White employees in healthcare inclusion work. \nFrom the article, “Recognizing Privilege and Bias: An Interactive Exercise to Expand \nHealth Care Providers’ Personal Awareness” (Holm, Rowe Gorosh, Brady, & White-Perkins, \n2017), we learn about the Privilege and Responsibility Curricular Exercise (PRCE), an \neducational intervention designed by the Institute on Multicultural Health at Henry Ford, a \nthe largest hospital system in Detroit, to build awareness of, and skills to address, racial bias \nand its intersections. The PRCE was one part of a series of Continuing Medical Education \ntrainings between 2009 and 2012 focused on building healthcare workers’ awareness of race \nprivilege and other privileges, the impacts of those privileges, building ‘cultural humility’, \nand how to use one’s privilege to help reduce health care inequities (Holm et al., 2017). The \n48 \n \n \n \ntrainings were designed to ‘[prepare] participants to serve as “ambassadors” of health care \nequity and advocates of culture change in various business units and locations’ (p.360).   \nThe Holm study is solution-oriented research describing one intervention to interrupt \nand transform the abuses of White privilege in a workplace setting. Holm and company \ndescribe an intentional exercise in beginning the employee journey toward using their \nprivileges to creating a more equitable healthcare delivery system. The PRCE was modeled \non the work on White privilege of McIntosh (1988).17 Workshop facilitators used McIntosh’s \nprivilege ‘knapsack’ concept: a physical pouch into which participants place pennies that \nlargely race-based privileges. In the PRCE, the designers expanded McIntosh’s list to 22 \nstatements, which included intersectional issues such as gender, ethnicity, class (‘SES’: \nsocio-economic status) language, and housing status (p. 322). See Table 4 below for a partial \nlist of the PRCE’s privilege statements. Participants visited small displays placed around the \nroom with the privilege statements, placing a penny from that station into their bag. At the \nend, the participants tallied their pennies and then were led through a series of large group \nand break-out sessions that asked people to notice who had less or more pennies and to have \na dialogue about the meaning of the exercise (p. 361).  \nTable 4: A selection of statements from Henry Ford Health System’s Privilege and \nResponsibility Curricular Exercise with possible related social categories \nStatement Possible related social categories \nIf I should need to move, I can be pretty \nsure of renting or purchasing a home in an \narea in which I can afford and in which I \nRace, ethnicity, religion, SES, sexual \norientation \n                                                 \n17 McIntosh’s model has undergone significant critique and development. See J. Lensmire, Timothy & K. \nMcManimon, Shannon & Dockter Tierney, Jessica & E. Lee-Nichols, Mary & Casey, Zachary & Lensmire, \nAudrey & M. Davis, Bryan. (2013).  \n49 \n \n \n \nwould want to live. \nIf I ask to talk to the person in charge, I \nwill be facing a person similar to me. \nRace, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation \nIf I walk into an emergency room I can \nexpect to be treated with dignity and \nrespect. \nRace, ethnicity, physical/mental ability, \nSES, sexual orientation, body type \nI can be sure that if I need legal or medical \nhelp, my race will not work against me. \nRace \nI can go home from most meetings feeling \nsomewhat engaged, rather than isolated, \nout-of-place, or unheard. \nAge, race, ethnicity, gender, language \n \nHolm’s study is also helpful in that it identifies, in an anecdotal way, White \nparticipants’ reactions to the process of group exploration of societal privilege. The scholars \ncited numerous examples of ‘White fragility’ at work. For instance, as the researchers state, \n‘Some participants from historically dominant groups, when sharing that they could not \nclaim a statement, felt the fact that they could not claim a privilege disproved the importance \nof social identities (p. 362).’ For example, when considering the experience of passing \nthrough airport security checkpoints as an indicator of privilege, some White participants \nexpressed their anxiety that they would be singled out for a more thorough search. Consistent \nwith a common feature of White group-level attitudes, these individuals then took this as \nevidence that societal bias was fairly ubiquitous, irrespective of race privilege. On the \nemotional side, Holm comments, ‘those [participants] with the most privileges expressed a \nmixture of appreciation and of embarrassment and guilt’, which the scholars interpreted as \n‘precursors to both cultural humility and a fresh motivation to promote system changes’ (p. \n362). This result demonstrates both the positive impacts of examining social privilege and a \ncommon feature of ‘White fragility’.  \n50 \n \n \n \nThe primary weakness in the researchers’ results were purely qualitative and did not \nempirically analyze the outcomes of the PRCE. The reason provided for this was that ‘the \nexercise was embedded within a broader campaign to change HFHS’s organizational culture \naround healthcare disparities, making it difficult to isolate its effects’ (p. 363). It is clear that \nfollow-up research should include a more rigorous and quantitative assessment of pre- and \npost-intervention attitudes. \nWhile Henry Ford’s PRCE demonstrated several important concepts surrounding \nengaging White people in workplace inclusion at the interpersonal level, Robert Weech-\nMaldonado and Janice Dreachslin’s work on the national center for healthcare leadership \ndiversity demonstration (NCHLDD) project illustrates critical concepts on an organizational \nlevel. The NCHLDD employed a pre-post control group design with two hospital systems on \nthe East Coast to assess the impact of a ‘systematic, multifaceted, and organizational level \ncultural competency initiative’ on diversity, inclusion, and cultural competency metrics (p. \n32). The overall findings were that ‘overall performance improvement was greater in each of \nthe two intervention hospitals than in the control hospital within the same health care system’ \n(p. 30). These improvements were seen in diversity leadership, strategic human resource \nmanagement, and diversity climate. Also, Blacks at the intervention hospitals showed \nimproved ‘individual level competencies for diversity attitudes and implicit bias’ (p. 30). \nHowever, Whites experienced the opposite effect - ‘deterioration,’ or worsening, of their \nnon-racist identities from the pre- to post-intervention (p. 39).  \nWeech-Maldonado and Dreachslin begin their study noting the numerous health \ndisparity and leadership diversity metrics had either remained stable or worsened from 2011 \nto the 2014 reports on quality from the AHRQ. These disparities were found between the \n51 \n \n \n \nhealth outcomes, care delivered, and job satisfaction between Whites and underrepresented \nminority and marginalized groups (Weech-Maldonado, 2018, p. 31). Regarding White job \nsatisfaction, the researchers point out, ‘non-Hispanic White men [expressed] the most job \nsatisfaction with equity and opportunity in the workplace’ (p. 31).   \nTheir ‘systematic diversity intervention’ was anchored in two levels of data: the \norganizational level and the individual level (See Figure 1 below). The organizational-level \nassessment was on ‘diversity leadership,’ ‘strategic human resource management,’ and \n‘patient cultural competency’ and the individual-level assessment was on ‘diversity \nattitudes,’ ‘implicit bias,’ and ‘racial /ethnic identity status. The organizational outcome \nmeasures were ‘workforce diversity’ and ‘diversity climate’ (p. 32-33). Relevant to the \ncurrent study, to measure racial identity status, the researchers used Helms’ (1990, 1995) \nBlack and White Racial Identity Attitude Scales (BRIAS and WRIAS).  \nFigure 1: Conceptual framework of the NCHLDD (Weech-Maldonado, 2018, p.32) \n \nThe NCHLDD performed an extensive array of interventions at the two experimental \nhospitals and, within the self-same two healthcare networks, performed no interventions at \n52 \n \n \n \ncontrol hospitals. The diversity and inclusion interventions were comprehensive both \nvertically and horizontally in the experimental hospitals (see Figure 2 below).  \nFigure 2: NCHLDD project intervention flow diagram (Weech-Maldonado, 2018, p. 33) \n \nThere were numerous findings from Weech-Maldonado that are relevant to the \ncurrent topic. The overall finding that, ‘performance [in diversity and inclusion measures] \nwas greater in… the intervention hospitals’ lends support to strategic interventions that \ndirectly targets both the organizational level and the interpersonal levels (p. 30). There were \nsignificant outcomes in terms of representational diversity and scores for ‘organizational \ninclusion’ and ‘organizational fairness’ (p. 39).  \nHowever, the finding that is most relevant to the current study was on the individual \nattitude measures. While Blacks’ scores ‘improved,’ Whites experienced ‘deterioration’ of \ntheir non-racist identities on the Helms WRIAS from the pre- to post-intervention (p. 39). \nThis means that the impact on Whites’ reactions to the project’s menu of training, coaching, \n53 \n \n \n \nand support was to retrench into more racist states of White identity. Additionally, there was \nan telling result regarding employee turnover that affected the sample:  \nAnecdotal evidence from leadership team post-intervention group interviews and \nobservations by the diversity coach… indicates that some of the turnover was due to \nthe project itself, which resulted in some departures by individuals who were not \nsupportive of the enhanced focus on diversity as well as the addition of new staff who \njoined the hospital because of the diversity focus (p. 39). \n While the researchers do not report on what the racial identity of the leaders whom \ndeparted nor those who joined. However, it is indicative of sometimes conflicting goals of \nincreasing representational diversity through some combination of new hires and replacing \nthose that left, and fostering more inclusion with the individuals already in place.  \nOrienting Theories \nPsychological safety \nInclusion work in healthcare organizations involves asking employees to learn new \nconcepts, build new relationships, adopt new behaviors, and adhere to new policies \n(Dreachslin et al., 2017). Learning and growth at work are predicated on the existence of \nemployee’s psychological safety (Edmondson, 2002, 2019; Dollard and Bakker, 2010; \nNembhard and Edmondson, 2006). Workers feel psychologically safe when they perceive a \nhigh degrees of security in employment status and trust in their work relationships. When \npsychological safety is high, workers can develop trusting relationships, learn new skills, and \nhelp organizations grow and innovate (Edmondson, 2002; Hackman and Lorsch, 1987). On \nthe flip side, when fear and mistrust are dominant, employees exhibit disengagement, \n54 \n \n \n \nstagnation, resistance to change, and other behaviors intended to shield individuals from \nfurther insecurity, both real and emotional (Ross et al., 2018; Dollard and Bakker, 2010).  \nAs described above, when White people are asked to consider the topics of diversity, \ninclusion, race and associated issues, particularly on the interpersonal level, they are \nparticularly prone to exhibit behavior that signals a loss of psychological safety (Sue et al., \n2010; DiAngelo, 2011). These “defensive moves” include disbelief, distancing, anger, and \navoidance (Kidder et al., 2004). Some White people may fear that working on diversity and \ninclusion issues poses a threat to their job status due to perceived or real efforts to increase \nthe representation of non-Whites (Shteynberg et al., 2011). Another threat to White’s \npsychological safety is the fear of their behavior being labeled “racist” and therefore subject \nto ridicule, exclusion, and loss of status (Sue et al., 2010). The racist/not racist binary reflects \nWhite people’s perception that improving racial equity is a ‘zero-sum game’: non-White \npeople’s gains are White people’s losses (Norton and Sommers, 2011). The consequences for \nWhites in loss of psychological safety underlines the primary importance of diversity leaders \ncreating an atmosphere of security in workplace inclusion strategies, messaging, and \ninterventions. \nPositive Identity and Relationship Development  \n A major assumption of workplace inclusion strategies is that a culture of inclusion \nenables positive identity development at work (Stevens et al., 2008; Groggins and Ryan, \n2013). Positive organizational scholars show that all workers try to self-construct identities at \nwork that express positive attributes such as goodness and worthiness (Dutton et al., 2010; \nWrzesniewski and Dutton, 2001). In turn, positive identities help employees develop the \nsocial resources, or positive relationships, needed to secure other resources such as task-level \n55 \n \n \n \nhelp, time, money, and political capital (Dutton and Ragins, 2017; Dutton et al., 2010). In \naddition, these positive relationships increase worker resilience in the face of stressful \nconditions (Carmeli et al., 2009). While positive relationships have numerous dimensions, \nleading positive organizational scholar Jane Dutton offers the following general definition: ‘a \npositive work relationship [is a] reoccurring connection between two people that takes place \nwithin the context of work and careers and is experienced as mutually beneficial, where \nbeneficial is defined broadly to include any kind of positive state, process, or outcome in the \nrelationship’ (2017, p. 9).   \n Positive identity and relationships at work are critical concepts for workplace \ninclusion theorists and practitioners (Davidson, M. N., & James, E. J. 2006; Ely and Roberts, \n2008; Creary 2019). Because ‘stereotypes and power imbalances between groups at the \nsocietal level pose threats to people’s identity’, ‘members [should] submit to outward-\nfocused goals – for example, the goal of advancing broad social ideals, furthering an \norganization’s mission, or enhancing the \nquality of their relationships’ (Ely and Roberts 2008, page 176). Ely and Roberts (2008) \nshow how the positive relationship view takes into account three factors that the ‘difference’ \napproach does not: simultaneity, intra-group relations, and diversity as an asset (pps.176 - \n179). As a precursor to the more recent concept of intersectionality, ‘simultaneity refers to \nthe fact that people hold multiple identities, some culturally marginalized...and some \nprivileged (e.g., men, Whites, heterosexuals), and that the meaning and impact of each \ndepends in part on the others’ (p.177). A study of intra-group relations, including in more \nprivileged identity groups, shows that ‘sameness is more than just the absence of difference; \nit has its own dynamics that influence how diversity plays out’ (p.178). Lastly, echoing the \n56 \n \n \n \nappreciative inquiry approach (Cooperrider and Whitney, 2005; Bushe, 2012), the positive \nrelationships approach incorporates the many assets of diversity in work groups. These \nassets, in particular group learning, are enabled by ‘culturally diverse teams whose members \nanchor on outward focused goals’ (193). More diverse teams create a fertile ground for \nbuilding more positive relationships. In this way, diverse, inclusive teams create what Dutton \ncalls the ‘social resources’ needed to fulfill both organizational goals and positive identity \ndevelopment goals.  \nOrganizational Culture Change \nIn this study, the operational definition of workplace inclusion is ‘the extent to which \nemployees, regardless of social identity or group affiliation, feel they are a part of the \norganizational system, both in terms of formal processes like decision making and promotion \nand informal processes like ‘water cooler’ conversations’. This definition shows how \ninclusion is organization-wide and it deals with issues of both a technical and cultural nature. \nTherefore, promoting healthcare workforce inclusion can be viewed as an organizational \nchange project featuring the issue of culture. I use two sources of knowledge to explicate \ninclusion strategies as organizational culture change: Edgar Schein, preeminent \norganizational psychologist, and Jeff Hiatt and Tim Creasey, leaders at ProSCI, an \nindependent science-driven organization dedicated to research and training in the practice of \nchange management.    \nEdgar Schein’s (2010, 2016) work on organizational culture and culture change \nshows that, far beyond the visible signs, these processes reflect “shared learning of the group \nas it solves problems of external adaptation and internal integration; which has worked well \nenough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct” \n57 \n \n \n \nway of being in relation to those problems (2016, p. 6). This body of shared learning can be \nperceived through visible, feelable signs, what Schein (2016) calls ‘artifacts’, such as office \nlayout, manners of speech, emotional expression, embedded skills, shared meanings (p.17). \nCulture is also communicated through espoused beliefs and values, which can be found in \nofficial communications, and ideologies and rationalizations which may not be explicitly \nstated (p.18). At the deepest level, the level hidden from most of the employees, are the basic \nunderlying assumptions. Organizational culture is inherently differentiated between \noverlapping subcultures, diffuse across groups, and dynamic over time, but has ‘some \nstability’ (p.10). Therefore, culture change, planned or unplanned, involves changes to \nartifacts, espoused beliefs, and underlying assumptions of individuals working within one or \nmany groups within an organization.  \nTo Schein, planned management of culture change moves through three stages: one, \ncreating motivation and readiness, two, learning new concepts, new meanings, and new \nstandards of judgement, and three, internalizing new concepts, meanings, and standards (p. \n323). Change begins with ‘disconfirmation’ of existing structures of belief about how the \norganization can sufficiently meet its goals. Schein cites a relevant example of \ndisconfirmation from healthcare: “there are many change programs that require doctors to \ngive up some of the autonomy that they have always assumed was intrinsic to their role, or to \nlearn new behavior patterns vis-a-vis patients, nurses, or technicians” (2016, p.326). \nDisconfirmation challenges the basic assumptions of the culture and individuals experience \nfear regarding survival and anxiety about needing to learn new ways of being. It is worth \nenumerating Schein’s specific categories of fears based upon learning anxiety since they \n58 \n \n \n \nspeak directly to the project of promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace (See Table \n5 below).   \nTable 5: Schein’s (2016) list of learning fears based sparked by organizational change \n \nFear Description \nFear of loss of power or position New learning may mean loss of status or \npower \nFear of temporary incompetence Giving up old ways of doing things \nmeans giving up expertise; we know we \nwill have to do things that we have not \nmastered yet  \nFear of punishment for \nincompetence  \nIf learning period results in mistakes or \ntoo long a duration, we fear productivity \nmay be harmed, resulting in reprisal by \nmanagement \nFear of loss of personal identity If new learning requires us to take on a \nnew way of being, we may not want be \n‘that kind of person’ \nFear of loss of group membership If new learning challenges shared \nassumptions of their group culture, \nchanging those assumptions also may \nresult in, or  appear to result in, \nseparation from the group \n \nThese fears trigger resistance in various forms, including denial, scapegoating, \ndodging, and bargaining (p. 327). Leaders’ natural inclination may be to attempt overcoming \nlearning anxiety by increasing the threat of survival if learning does not take place, but this \nmay ‘increase defensiveness,’ ‘overall tension,’ and more ‘unpredictable and undesirable \nresistance’ (p.327). Instead, Schein counsels change leaders, in his Stage 1 of change \nleadership, to create psychological safety in order to shepherd employees through the \nprocess. Schein’s eight strategies for creating safety are:  \n● Provide a compelling positive vision \n59 \n \n \n \n● Provide formal training \n● Involve the learner \n● Train relevant ‘family’ groups and teams \n● Provide resources \n● Provide positive role models \n● Provide support groups \n● Remove barriers and build new supporting systems and structures (p. 328-330) \n Schein’s Stage 2, ‘the actual change and learning process’ is comprised of two \nmethods of learning in the workplace: one, imitation and identification learning and two, \nscanning and trial-and-error learning. The imitation and identification learning requires that \nthe change leaders model the type of learning that they wish to see and train other leaders to \ndo the same. The primary leadership implication of scanning and trial-and-error learning is to \ncreate both ad hoc and formal opportunities for workers to be self-directed in finding \nsolutions to problems of culture change. In fact, the overall principle for Stage 2 is ‘the \nchange leader must be clear about the ultimate goals, … but that does not necessarily imply \nthat everyone will reach that goal in the same way” (p.332).  \nHowever workers learn the new skills and shared assumptions indicative of culture \nchange, Schein has further recommendations for maximizing the chances that changes will \nbe adopted and stick, including \n● Connect beliefs, values, and behavior. ‘Behavior change leads to culture \nchange only if the new behavior is perceived to make things better and \ntherefore becomes internalized and stable’ (p. 333) \n60 \n \n \n \n● Change leaders should emphasize behavior change but remember that culture \nchange is only happening when existing employees ultimately move through \n“cognitive redefinition” of core assumptions (p. 333) \n● Remember learning can be new concepts or just new meaning for old concepts \n● Develop new standards of evaluation and controls \n● Define change goals concretely, not as a culture change (p. 338) \n Beyond this menu of recommendations, Schein’s work has strong implications for \nworkplace inclusion leaders in healthcare seeking to effectively engage White employees. \nOne implication is that the culture of inclusion can be seen as shared learning of new basic \nassumptions. This gives the change leader a manageable practice area (learning) in which to \nfocus her efforts. The other implication is that, in order to successfully engage White \nemployees and all stakeholders, effective change leaders must actively manage psychological \nsafety.  \nJeffrey Hiatt and Tim Creasey are the CEO and Chief DEvelopment Officer of \nProSCI, an independent, science-driven organization dedicated to the practice of change \nmanagement based in Colorado, USA.18 Hiatt and Creasey’s 2012 book Change \nManagement: The People Side of Change lays out a comprehensive change management \nagenda for at both the individual and organizational levels (Hiatt and Creasey, 2012). The \nauthors cite ProSCI’s longitudinal research of senior leaders, project managers, and change \nmanagers at over 1,000 organizations around the world, which results in the bi-annual Best \nPractices in Change Management report (Creasey and Hiatt 2019). In the 2018 Best \n                                                 \n18 Disclosure: In 2015, I was certified as a ProSCI Change Management Practitioner. \n61 \n \n \n \nPractices, 24% of the responding organizations in the study were healthcare delivery \norganizations (p. 27).  \nA core tenet of Hiatt and Creasey’s (2012) work is that all ‘organizational outcomes \nare the collective result of individual change’ (p. 4)  The individual change model is known \nas the acronym ADKAR, which stands for awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and \nreinforcement (p. 46). To Hiatt and Creasey, change leaders must attend to each of these \nfactors in order to help individuals successfully move through significant changes in a \nworkplace setting. To facilitate individual changes that meet organizational outcomes, the \nProSCI change management model sets the stage, prepares each player, and provides the \nframework of a script for carrying out the change drama. The organizational concepts from \nHiatt and Creasey that are most relevant to the current study are senders and receivers and \nauthority for change.  \nSenders and receivers recognizes the fact that in every organizational change, there \nare senders who provide information and receivers who are given information (p. 16). Of the \nmany implications of this simple concept is that senders’ communications are seen a certain \nway based on who they are, where they sit in the organization, and how they are likely to be \nimpacted by the change. Similarly, the change-related information has a particular impact on \nreceivers of information based on who they are, where they sit in the organization, and how \nlikely they are to be personally impacted. While senders, largely senior and middle \nmanagement, may be communicating about the things they are most concerned with, this \nmay or may not be what receivers are concerned with. Thus, senders and receivers are often \nnot in dialogue with one another, particularly at the early stages of a change (see Figure 3).  \n62 \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Disconnect between senders and receivers of information about organizational \nchange (Creasey and Hiatt, 2012) \n \n \n \nSenders may spend 95% of their communications on business-level impacts and 5% \non the impact to individual constituencies. Conversely, receivers may spend 95% of their \ntime thinking about what the implications and risk are to them and 5% of their mindshare is \ndedicated to business-level impacts. The ‘consequence is that much of the key business \ninformation communicated by the supervisor to the employee’ in early conversations is not \nheard (Hiatt and Creasey, 2012, p. 17). Instead, receivers may be thinking about ‘whether or \nnot they trust the sender,’ ‘their current job performance,’ ‘their past experiences with \nchange,’ or ‘what they have heard from their friends or colleagues’ (p. 17). Based upon the \nProSCI longitudinal studies, receivers prefer two primary senders and particular messages \n(See Figure 4).  \n \n \nSenders \nReceivers  \nPersonal implications & risk \nBusiness issues & need for change  \n63 \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Preferred senders of change-related information according to receivers \n \n \nOne preferred sender is the immediate supervisor, from whom they want to hear \ninformation about personal impact, group impact, and day-to-day job impact. The other \npreferred sender is the business leader, from whom receivers want to hear the business \nreasons for changing, the alignment with vision and strategy, and what the risks are for not \nchanging.  \nThere are numerous implications of ProSCI’s senders and receivers concept for \nworkplace inclusion leaders looking to effectively engage White employees. The most \nrelevant implications areas are for the communications plan and the coaching plan. For \ncommunications planning, senior leaders and change managers should consider each specific \naudience, including those with a White racial identity, carefully. Early communications must \nbe clear, repeated numerous times, and the preferred types of messages should come from \npreferred senders. Senior leaders communicate about the business and strategy and \n“Practical tips for making change stick.” A presentation by Michelle Bundy, ARMA Nova at Freddie Mac, \nFebruary 21, 2018. Tysons Corner, Virginia; ProSCI Best Practices in Change Management, 2016 edition \n64 \n \n \n \nimmediate supervisors communicate about personal-level impacts, otherwise known as \nWhat’s In It For Me? [WIIFM] (p.67-69). For many employees, even senior managers \nthemselves, fully understanding the WIIFM is possible only with an individual coaching \nconversation rather than group communication. To the extent that White employees may \nhave different WIIFMs, questions, and concerns in relation to diversity and inclusion \nstrategies, coaching would be a critical activity for managing resistance and building \ngrassroots change leadership (Hiatt and Creasey, 2012, p. 69; Creasey and Hiatt 2019).  \nAnother key concept relevant from Hiatt and Creasey that is relevant to the current \ntopic is authority for change. The last six ProSCI longitudinal studies (2018, 2016, 2014, \n2012, 2010, 2008) have found that the existence of a highly engaged executive sponsors is \nthe number one predictor of successful organizational changes (Creasey and Hiatt, 2019). In \n2016, 72% of the surveyed projects that successfully met their targets had executive sponsors \nthat were ‘extremely effective’ whereas only 29% had ‘very ineffective sponsors’ (Creasey \nand Hiatt, 2017, p. 7). According to this research, the three primary roles of the executive \nsponsor of change are:  \n● Actively and visibly participate in the change process  \n● Build coalitions of sponsorship to rally support and mitigate resistance to the change \n● Communicate directly with employees about the change and why it is needed (Hiatt \nand Creasey, 2012, p. 23) \n If these three pieces are in place, the change efforts has the resources it needs, broad-\nbased support, and employees understand the change and where to go for concerns and \nquestions. However, ‘many projects struggle because they lack sponsorship,’ and it may be \nbecause executive sponsors \n65 \n \n \n \n● Sign the check and ‘disappear’  \n● Abdicate their role to a middle manager or consultant \n● Lack the power themselves to authorize and lead \n● Are distrusted by employees because of past change efforts or other factors (Hiatt and \nCreasey, 2012, p. 24) \nThe primary implication of Hiatt and Creasey’s executive sponsorship insights for \nworkplace inclusion leaders is that they should train their executive sponsors to be active and \nvisible, build coalitions, and communicate directly. This training should be codified in a \nsponsorship plan, start at the beginning of the change process, and continue throughout the \nchange. When combined with Schein’s work on leading culture change, these \nrecommendations form a holistic agenda for helping inclusion strategies reach their goals. \nSummary and Gaps in Literature \n This chapter dealt provided a review of extant literature regarding the topic of \neffective engagement of White people in healthcare workplace inclusion strategies. This \nreview had four  major goals: (1) to provide context through a description of the current \nsituation and definitions of key terms, (2) explore the extant literature, including two \nillustrative case studies, (3) present orienting theories, and (4) summarize the review and \nidentify gaps in the literature. \nDue to persistent and gross health disparities and a push for greater healthcare quality, \nthe issue of promoting greater diversity, inclusion, and equity in the US healthcare system is \na high priority for sector leaders. An overrepresentation of White individuals in leadership \npositions has remained fairly stable over the last 20 years despite some success in increasing \nthe representational diversity of the ‘top of the funnel’ for leadership positions. This has led \n66 \n \n \n \nto an increased focus on increasing retention and advancement through a more inclusive \nworkplace environment. Since at least 85% of senior leaders in C-suite are White, this \nindicates a focus on successful engagement of Whites in workplace inclusion strategies is \npromising.  \nIn order to establish a common understanding of relevant topics and provide \nbackground to the current study, I defined seven abstract concepts: inclusion, diversity, \nhealth disparity and health equity, cultural competence, engage, and White people. I relied \nheavily on Mor Barak (2013) to define inclusion as ‘the extent to which employees, \nregardless of social identity or group affiliation, feel they are a part of the organizational \nsystem, both in terms of formal processes like decision making and promotion and informal \nprocesses like “water cooler” conversations’. \n Despite the relatively scant scholarly attention that this particular topic has received, \nthere were several key learnings that emerged from the review of literature. From the work of \nPlaut (2011) and Apfelbaum (2016), we found support for the contention that, due to their \noverall social position of numerical dominance and power, White people’s encounter with \nworkforce -based inclusion efforts is exceptional. They also found that this encounter but can \nbe managed with adjustments in diversity approach, or the way in which diversity and \ninclusion are discussed. Active management of diversity approach for Whites can result in \nbeneficial work-related outcomes. The recommended diversity approach implied by the \nresearch is ‘all-inclusive,’ does not use language exclusionary to European Americans, and \nstresses the organization’s belief in both the value of employee differences and in the value \nin equality between employees. Lastly, this body of research calls for approaches to be \ntailored based upon the particular situation with regards to representational diversity.  \n67 \n \n \n \nThe literature on White racial identity also pertains directly to this topic. Scholars \nsuch as McIntosh (1988), DiAngelo (2011), Helms (1995), and Spanierman (2017) show \nthat, due to their unique position relative to institutional racism, White people have unique \nchallenges and opportunities vis-a-vis addressing racial inequality. The challenges include \nunconscious rehearsal of social privilege and greater sensitivity to race-related dialogue. On \nthe positive side, Whites have the potential to make an outsized impact on racism due to their \nproximity to power. The key takeaways for workplace inclusion leaders is that there is a \ndevelopmental process for Whites to achieve higher levels of non-racist or ally-like \nbehaviors. The experts in this area counsel that White people need challenge and support in \nboth intra-group and inter-group interactions. In addition, leaders should have the expectation \nthat there will be cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal challenges along the way.  \n I present two case studies to illustrate an interpersonal-level and organizational-level \nintervention to promote healthcare workplace interventions, including engagement of White \nemployees. Holm’s (2017) report on the Privilege and Responsibility Curricular Exercise at \nHenry Ford Health describes a workshop that helps employees understand and interrupt the \nabuses of social privilege in the healthcare workplace. While the PRCE provided a unique \nopportunity for Whites and non-Whites to work toward racial equity, the resulting write-up \nwas entirely qualitative and lacked empirical data. In contrast, Weech-Maldonado’s (2018) \nstudy on the national diversity demonstration project was a highly rigorous, two-year study \non a comprehensive strategic intervention testing both interpersonal and organizational \ninterventions at two health systems. The intervention hospitals saw improvements versus the \ncontrol in diversity leadership representation, human resource management, and diversity \nclimate. However, the finding most relevant to the current topic was that the measures of \n68 \n \n \n \nWhite non-racist attitudes deteriorated. All findings are somewhat called into question \nbecause there were very few employees who were sampled before and after the intervention \nand the senior leadership team experienced attrition, due in part to the project itself.  \nI describe three major orienting theories for making meaning of the topic at two \nlevels, the interpersonal and the organizational. On the interpersonal level, I examine \npsychological safety, and positive identity and relationship development. Scholars such as \nEdmondson (1999, 2006) have shown that psychological safety at work enables learning and \nrelationship-building. As developing a more inclusive workplace is fundamentally about \nlearning, it is essential that workplace inclusion leaders foster a sense of security. This can be \nparticularly true for White individuals because they are prone to insecurity when exposed to \nissues surrounding diversity and inclusion. Dutton (2010, 2017), Ely and Roberts (2006) and \ncolleagues have shown that he positive development of identity at work (i.e. worthiness, \ngoodness) allows the development of positive relationships (i.e. mutually beneficial), which \nare essential to withstand the rigors of inclusion work.  \nI explore the organizational theory of culture change through the eyes of Schein \n(2010) and Hiatt and Creasey (2012). Schein explains how culture is shared learning from \nsolving problems that operates at visible levels such as language and invisible levels such as \nshare underlying assumptions. As workplace inclusion leaders know well, culture change is a \ngroup learning activity that challenges underlying assumptions and triggers fears about \nsurvival and learning. Numerous of Schein’s recommendations for leading culture change are \napt for inclusion leaders seeking to effectively engage employees with White racial identity. \nThese recommendations include knowing the audience, providing a compelling vision, \n69 \n \n \n \nemphasizing behavior change and not culture change, and connecting beliefs, values, and \nbehavior.  \nMany of Schein’s recommendations are echoed by Hiatt and Creasey (2012) and the \nProSCI, an independent change management research organization. Relying on ProSCI data \nfrom longitudinal studies over a 20 year span, Hiatt and Creasey show how leading the \n‘people side of change’ leads to successful organizational changes. Their work has \nimplications for communications, coaching, and executive sponsorship of workplace \ninclusion efforts. In official and unofficial communications, inclusion leaders should attend \nclosely to both the senders and receivers of information - who they are and what they want to \nhear based upon their self-interest. Receivers, including White employees involved in a \nchange, want to hear business-related information from senior-most leaders and personal \nimpact-related information from direct supervisors, ideally in a coaching conversation. Based \non convincing data from the field of change management, Hiatt and Creasey argue that \nexecutive sponsors are the most important role in leading the people side of change. \nHowever, in order to be effective, executive sponsors need to be active and visible \nthroughout a change, build coalitions, and communicate directly to employees about the \nchange.  \nThe extant literature summarized above has several gaps when considering the \nsubject of effective engagement of White people in workforce inclusion in healthcare \norganizations. The work on diversity approach only considers the impact on White \nemployees from how workforce inclusion is discussed. Further research should focus on \nstrategic frame (i.e. business case) and on the actual interventions. The work on White racial \nidentity development has not received a proper treatment from a healthcare organization \n70 \n \n \n \nperspective nor have the impacts of interventions designed with the ‘Whiteness’ lens been \nstudied. Given the healthcare industry’s professed need to improve workplace inclusion and \nthe persistent lack of racial diversity in healthcare leadership, there have been little academic \nstudy of the interpersonal and organizational issues surrounding engagement of Whites in \npromoting a more inclusive workplace.19 \n  \n                                                 \n19 For non-academic studies of engagement of White people in workforce inclusion, see Shelton (2013), \nDiversity Best Practices (2013), Witt/Keifer (2015), and White Men as Full Diversity Partners (2018). \n71 \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 3 \nMETHODOLOGY \n \nThis study was designed to explore the effective engagement of White people in \nhealthcare workplace inclusion strategies. In this chapter, I discuss the methodological \napproach of the study, the use of semi-structured interviews, sample selection, data analysis, \nand limitations of the methodology. \nData Collection \n My data collection strategy was designed to (1) gather relevant, valid, reliable \nprimary data from practitioners of workplace inclusion in a resource-efficient manner, (2) \nbuild positive relationships that would become an ongoing resource for further research and \nimplementation of inclusion strategies, and (3) generate self-reflective, experiential data \nregarding the relationship between the topic and my social identities. \nQualitative Methodology \n  Based upon my goals for data collection, I chose the qualitative research \nmethodology of semi-structured interviews. Workplace inclusion, diversity, and allied topics \nare socially constructed, symbolic, and imbued with multiple meanings (Mease, 2016). \nQualitative research is a good match with the topic because its goal is ‘to describe, decode, \ntranslate or otherwise come to terms with the meaning, not the frequency, of certain more or \nless naturally occurring phenomena in the social world’ (Van Maanen, 1979, p. 520).  \nFurther, ‘the focus in many qualitative studies typically is on the unfolding of process rather \nthan the structure’ (Hari Das 1983, page 301). The process of creating meaning in workplace \ninclusion research is mediated by the dynamic interplay between social identities, power, and \nprivilege of the researchers and the subjects (Mease, 2016; Sue et al., 2010).  Qualitative \n72 \n \n \n \nresearch therefore stands a better chance of capturing the ‘serendipitous’ (Hari Das 1983, \npage 301) nature of inclusion research. Further, meta-analysis of the interplay between the \nresearcher’s social positionality and that of the subjects yields unique, actionable insights on \nthe topic at hand (McIntosh, 1988; Helms, 1993; DiAngelo, 2011; Lensmire et al., 2013).  \nSemi-structured Interviews \n Per the goals listed above, I chose qualitative interviews of leaders and consultants in \nhealthcare workplace inclusion in order to generate relevant, observable data on the topic, \nbuild relationships for future research, and create opportunities for recording self-reflected, \nexperiential meta-data. I chose semi-structured interviews to create reasonable boundaries \naround the data while allowing participants to used their own words to describe their work. \nSemi-structured interviews acknowledge that the same words will have different meanings \nfor different study participants (Louise Barriball and While, 1994). Semi-structured \ninterviewing also adheres to the Grounded Theory, which directs the researcher to allow \nparticipants to define which data is relevant to the topic at hand (Creswell and Poth, 2017). \nMy semi-structured interviewing method also reflected a Grounded approach in that I \nallowed my ever-evolving thinking on the topic, my relationship to the subjects, and the \npurpose of the study to impact the process of interviewing. For example, if a participant \nexpressed a strong preference for using particular words in reference to diversity and \ninclusion topics, I would adopt these words for use in subsequent questions. While the words \noccasionally changed, my questions had specific outcomes that I believed would be essential \nto inform my thinking about how practitioners see effective engagement of White people in \nhealthcare workplace inclusion (See Table 6 below).  \n   \n73 \n \n \n \nTable 6: Prepared statements and questions and desired outcomes of semi-structured \ninterviews \nPrepared Statements and Questions Desired Outcomes \n \nStatement: Thank you very much for agreeing to be \na participant-partner of this research project \nregarding the effective engagement of White people \nin workplace inclusion strategies in healthcare \ndelivery organizations. My use of the phrase \n“participant-partner” communicates my hope that \nyou will get to contribute to and benefit from the \nresearch process. \n \nOur one-hour qualitative interview session is being \nrecorded and transcribed to aid data collection and \nanalysis. I will also be taking handwritten notes. The \ndata is confidential and your identity will remain \nanonymous throughout the research process.  \n \nThere will be three main parts to the interview - one, \ngetting to know you and your overall approach to \npromoting an inclusive workplace, two, hearing your \nthoughts about, and experiences with, engaging \nWhite people with this work, and three, a discussion \nabout how you see this work evolving. \n \n● Build rapport \n● Frame topic \n● Prime participant’s thinking about \nthe topic \n● Build trust  \nQuestion: Do you have any questions before we \nbegin?  \n● To help the participant voice \nquestions about the research or \ninform me of logistical issues \n● To help the participant focus on the \ntopic at hand \nQuestion: What does your typical work day look \nlike? \nWhat are your formal and informal responsibilities \nfor promoting workplace inclusion? \nAbout how long have you held this \nposition/appointment?   \n \n● Build rapport \n● Understand the participant’s role - \nin name and in practice - in \npromoting inclusion \n● Understand the participants \nrelative power and influence \nQuestion: What got you into the work of diversity, \nequity and inclusion?  \n● Build rapport \n● Prime participant in thinking about \n74 \n \n \n \nWhat do you enjoy about this work? \nWhat about the work has been challenging? \nCould you tell me about a past experience that has \nbeen influential for you? \n \nhow their personal story influences \ntheir work \n● Begin explanation of the strategies \nand tactics  \n \nQuestion: How would you describe your overall \napproach to promoting an inclusive healthcare \nworkplace?

If the primary questions did not fulfill the intended outcome, or \nwere not appropriate or useful, I prepared secondary questions in order to reach the desired \noutcomes. I avoided strict time limits and goal-directed questioning because, as Corbin and \nMorse note, ‘interactive interviews are shared experiences in which researchers and \ninterviewees come together to create a context of conversational intimacy’ (2003, page 338). \nThis intimacy results in participants providing narrative-driven data which creates novel \n76 \n \n \n \ninsights into their thinking around the topic (Ramos, 1989). If the participant fulfilled an \nintended outcome of a question with a previous answer, I would skip this question. If the \nparticipant gave me an answer to a question that I did not ask, I did not stop, correct, reframe, \nor redirect the participant’s answer. Depending on the pace and length of the participant’s \nanswers, I skipped questions in order to reach subsequent questions that I perceived to be \nmore important to reaching the intended outcomes.  \n The 16 interviews of healthcare inclusion elites were conducted over the virtual \nmeeting application Zoom and lasted for 60 minutes. Each interview’s audio file was \nrecorded. There were six videos recorded. If the interviewee logged on to the virtual meeting \nspace using only audio and not video, I did not ask them to use the video portion. The reason \nfor this decision was two-fold. One reason was efficiency in that having the participant \nattempt to log on to the video portion may have resulted in technical challenges, which in \nturn may have taken away significant time from the interview session.  The other reason that \nI did not ask all the participants to log on to the video feed is to reduce the chances of the \nparticipant experiencing the emotional agitation that is sometimes caused by technological \nchallenges and the resulting problem-solving. Knowing that the interviewer-interviewee \nrelationship was in its early, formative stages, I did not want to unnecessarily create \nagitation. As Corbin notes, creating an atmosphere of comfort and intimacy, rather than \ncontrol, is critical in qualitative interviews because a home-like atmosphere is more likely to \ninduce responses that capture the holistic nature of an issue (Corbin et al., 2008; Corbin and \nMorse, 2003).  \n77 \n \n \n \nSample \nIn pursuit of primary data regarding the effective engagement of White people in \nhealthcare workplace, I used a combination of purposive and convenience sampling \ntechniques to recruit 16 elite practitioners of healthcare workplace inclusion in major medical \ncenters. The purposive technique was used my selectivity in gaining referrals to either \norganizational leaders in major medical centers or expert consultants to this group. The \norganizational leaders had to have at least 30% of their time dedicated to workplace \ninclusion. The consultants were required to have significant experience serving the healthcare \nindustry. In my email and telephone outreach, I specified these criteria. If I was unsure about \nthe target’s eligibility, I would set up an introductory phone call. I also set up introductory \nphone calls for participants with whom I had no prior contact or introduction.  \nI also used a convenience sampling technique in that, starting with my prior client in \nthe healthcare space, I gained warm introductions to contacts in my client’s network and I set \nup interviews as soon as the person was identified. I did not recruit a representative sample in \nterms of type of organization (e.g. for-profit/nonprofit), geography (rural/urban) or \nrelationship to academia (university based/community based). However, my sample’s \ndemographic diversity was generally representative of healthcare inclusion leaders (see Table \n7 below).  \n I also applied a convenience sampling technique in the speed with which I identified, \nconnected with, and interviewed the sample, which occurred over a period of two months in \nearly 2019. The primary driver for this condensed time frame was to generate data and results \nthat were as recent as possible to the publication date. Considering that timeliness is critical \nin fast-moving and socially constructed topics such as diversity & inclusion, condensing the \n78 \n \n \n \ntime frame allowed me to generate more relevant results for practitioners. Thus, timeliness \nwas critical to pursuit of my goal of relevancy.  \nIn my outreach and in my interview introduction, I expressed my goal that the \ninterviewees would be “participant-partners”: they would contribute to and benefit from the \nresearch. Equity in the research relationship was top of mind because the inherent power \nimbalance between researchers and subjects is a critical concern of qualitative research, \nparticularly in healthcare (Råheim et al., 2016; Hewitt, 2007).  I developed the participant-\npartner concept in the interest in increasing equity and mutuality in the research relationship. \nIn addition, I viewed the interview process as an organizational development intervention in \nthat the thinking and behavior of workplace inclusion practitioners would be influenced by \nthe process itself. Such collaborative, generative interventions reflect the influence of \nappreciative inquiry (Cooperrider and Whitney, 2005) and collaborative inquiry (Kasl and \nYorks, 2002). Additionally, my recruitment of participant-partners acknowledged the \nprominent role of social interaction in making new meanings around socially-constructed \ntopics. As Wasserman explains, “The communication perspective on social construction \ntheory contends that meaning is continuously emerging in the turns and processes of social \ninteractions and speech acts of persons in conversations” (2018, page 249). \nThe participant-partners consisted of 12 organizational leaders in healthcare inclusion \nand four (4) expert consultants. I recruited the majority of the interviewees from inside \nhealthcare organizations to ground the data in an industry-native frame of reference. I \nincluded consultants with expertise in inclusion in order to provide a novel, outsider \nperspective and to leverage the consultants’ knowledge across clients and industries. The 12 \norganizational leaders were comprised of seven (7) medical leaders and five (5) staff. The \n79 \n \n \n \nmedical leaders were clinicians, academics, and teachers in major medical centers that held \nmultiple appointments but who had dedicated at least 30% of their time to workplace \ninclusion. Five (5) of the six medical leaders had a primary appointment at their medical \nschool, and were therefore primarily responsible for promoting inclusion at the school level \nrather than system-wide. The staff participants were leaders on the administrative side of \nhealthcare whose primary responsibility was promoting an inclusion agenda in the \norganization as a whole. There were eight (8) sampled healthcare organizations: four (4) \nacademic medical centers, two (2) nonprofit managed care organizations, one (1) pediatric \nhospital, and one (1) regional community health network. All of the sampled organizations \nwere non-profit organizations.  \nI recruited a diverse sample of participant-partners in terms of their visible social \nidentities, particularly their race and gender (See Table 7 below). These identities were an \nindependent assessment made by myself. I am a White man and I based my assessments \nupon contemporary socially constructed views of race and gender, using the prospective \ninterviewees’ photographs and names. Of 15 total interviewees, there were four (4) Black \nwomen, four (4) Black men, three (3) White women, two (2) White men, one (1) Latina \nwoman, and one (1) Latino men. In terms of racial identity, there were eight (8) Black \nparticipants, five (5) White participants, and two (2) Latino/Latina participants20. This \nsample is 67% people of color versus 71% of diversity & inclusion leaders in healthcare were \npeople of color in 2015 survey data from the AHA (IDHM, 2017). 53% of the participants \nwere women. \n  \n                                                 \n20 Neither the Latina or Latino participants also self-identified as White.  \n80 \n \n \n \nTable 7: Independent, external assessment of participant race and gender identity \nRace  Gender Count \nBlack Women 4 \nBlack Men 4 \nWhite Women 3 \nWhite Men 2 \nLatina Women 1 \nLatino Men 1 \n Total 15 \n \nDuring the interview phase, the participant-partners named other, non-visible \nidentities, either in response to the explicit question about identity, or in their answers to \nother questions21. These identities included biracial, GLBTQ22, American, first generation \nimmigrant, Jewish, ancestor of holocaust survivors, large, and elder.  \nData Analysis \n After the interviews were complete, I reviewed the recordings, transcriptions, and \nhandwritten notes. Using this data, I listed the responses to each question, removing or \naltering all references to potentially identifying information. I analyzed the data as a whole to \ncompile thematic categories. Consistent with a Grounded approach (Creswell and Poth, \n2017), during the data analysis stage, I did not attempt to fit the data into preconceived \ntheoretical frameworks (see Chapter 4: Findings. Finally, I assessed the connections between \n                                                 \n21 Some interviewees did not describe their racial identities. Some interviewees did not reveal further identities \nbeyond their race and gender.  \n22 Gay, Lesbian, Bi-Sexual, Transgender, or Queer/Questioning \n81 \n \n \n \nthe data, the extant literature, and organizing theories (see chapter 5: Interpretation of \nFindings).   \nLimitations \nMy research methodology was limited in several ways. First, the entirely qualitative \nnature of the semi-structured interviews lacked a quantitative assessment of the interviewee’s \nperspectives. Therefore I was unable to test particular hypotheses about effective engagement \nof White employees in workplace inclusion. In addition, since my interviews intentionally \nlacked a strict adherence to the agenda, not all of my original questions were answered and I \nreceived answers to questions that I did not ask. I also did not use a data-driven process to \ntest assumptions about what the most helpful interview questions might be prior to beginning \nthe interviews. Instead, I created the questions and the preparatory statement using the \nconcepts I had encountered during the literature review period and the feedback I received \nfrom my advisor and a third party expert.  \nMy sampling technique was another area of limitation. Given my bias for producing \ntimely data and results, my entire research period was 6 months long. This condensed time \nframe limited my choices in sampling. I settled on a combination of purposive and \nconvenience sampling techniques, which limited my ability to recruit a sample that reflected \nan ‘ideal’ distribution of attributes. My sample’s distribution of gender identity and of White \nand People of Color identities generally reflected that of healthcare leaders of diversity and \ninclusion. However, there were other attributes that were not distributed representatively, \nsuch as title, institution type, and geography.  \n82 \n \n \n \nLanguage Usage \n My use of language, particularly around social identities, was guided by \nprevailing norms of social science research and my involvement in various communities \nworking toward the human liberation. My use of language may not satisfy or comfort all \nreaders. My hope is that I invite the reader into a dialogue.  \nI used the following general guidelines from the writing center and diversity and \ninclusion offices of Hamilton College regarding the “Language of Difference”:  \n● Assume a wide audience \n● Include a rationale for your choice (see specific rationales below) \n● Use only the language that is necessary to the context - only mention difference when \nit is relevant \n● Avoid terms that evaluate \n● Use the appropriate degree of specificity; i.e. ‘Dominicans’ rather than ‘Hispanics.’ \n● Focus on people rather than on a method of categorization: ‘people with mental \nillness’ rather than ‘the mentally ill.’ \n● Avoid the term ‘minority’ if possible (Bowman et al, 2015) \nAdhering to APA, 6th edition style guidance, I capitalized racial identities such as \n‘Latino/a’, ‘Black’, and ‘White’, (2009, pp. 70–77). \n I use the phrases ‘non-White’ and ‘People of Color’ interchangeably. Per the \nguideline above, I used these phrases when appropriate and, when called for, I used more \nspecific words such as ‘Black’ when appropriate. Given that this research is focused on \npeople with White racial identity or who enjoy White privilege, I chose ‘non-White’ to \ndelineate those people that do not belong to this group. However, I was also aware of the \n83 \n \n \n \ndanger that, to some readers, using the phrase ‘non-White’ centers Whiteness and devalues \nthe diversity of the innumerable ethnic groups and nationalities whom do not experience \nWhite privilege. On the other hand, since my research dealt specifically with the set of \nadvantages, mind frames, and behaviors in the workplace associated with White privilege in \nthe US, I wanted to avoid obscure the inherently political nature of this issue. Therefore, I \noccasionally selected the phrase People of Color in order to frame this orientation to \nWhiteness in the positive. There is a robust debate regarding the use of ‘People of Color’ \n(Glover, 2016).23  \nI use the word ‘United States’ and not the word ‘American’. I do not use ‘American’ \nbecause this word, while used ubiquitously to refer to people who live in the United States of \nAmerica, conflates the geographical designation of the Americas with a nationality \ndesignation of one country in that area (Kirk, 2013). \nI use gender terminology (cisgender woman, cisgender man, transgender) and sex \nterminology (male, female) separately. However, when I reference literature that mixed \ngender and sex, sometimes my usage also became mixed.  \nI created pseudonyms for each of the 16 participants using gender-neutral names and \nused the pronoun ‘they’ in order to secure their anonymity (see Table 8).  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n23In the Re-Evaluation Counseling communities, a worldwide peer counseling organization of which I am a \nmember, we use the phrase, ‘People of the Global Majority’ (Re-evaluation Counseling, 2016). People of the \nGlobal Majority is used to connote the reality that people of non-European ethnicities are the majority, by a \nwide margin, of the worldwide population. I have chosen not to use ‘People of the Global Majority’ because I \nbelieved it may have caused an unnecessary distraction to the reader.  \n84 \n \n \n \nTable 8: Pseudonyms for participants \nDeandre Lane \nDionne Lonnie \nEmery Marques \nFinley Oakley \nFrancis Quinn \nHarper Robin \nJamie Sydney \nJo Zari \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n85 \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 4 \nKEY INTERVIEW FINDINGS \n \n“Healthcare systems have been working on this issue for the last 40 years [and] have made \nvery little progress.

In chapter 4, I will present key \nfindings from the primary research, which were gleaned from analyzing the data from 16 \nqualitative, semi-structured interviews of healthcare inclusion leaders and expert consultants. \nI present the critical data in the dominant themes that emerged from a close reading of each \ninterview transcript. I use direct quotes from the interviews, anonymized to ensure the \nconfidentiality of the participants. After the analysis was complete, I created pseudonyms for \neach participant. \nOf the 16 participants, 12 were leaders in eight healthcare delivery organizations in \nthe United States. The remaining three were independent diversity & inclusion consultants or \nleaders of independent organizations with extensive experience working with healthcare \ndelivery organizations. Table 9 below presents relevant characteristics of the workplaces and \npositions of participants. It is important to note that the majority of the organizations were \nacademic medical centers within a larger health network, but that other organizations were \nrepresented. The most common position type (9 of 16) was a senior or mid-senior faculty \n86 \n \n \n \nmember at a medical center with multiple appointments and varying responsibilities in \npromoting diversity and inclusion.  \nTable 9: Participant organization type, position type, and primary responsibility in diversity \nand inclusion work \nOrganization Types # Position Types and \nLevels \n# Primary Diversity & \nInclusion Responsibility  \n \n# \nAcademic medical \ncenter \n4 Senior healthcare leader \n(Faculty) \n5 Enterprise DI Strategy & \nLeadership \n5 \nNonprofit managed \ncare  \n2 Mid-senior healthcare \nleader (Faculty) \n4 Advisor or Consultant to \nEnterprise DI Leader \n5 \nConsultancy 2 Mid-senior healthcare \nleader (Staff) \n3 Faculty Diversity \nRecruitment & Retention \n3 \nPediatric 1 Senior consultant  3 Medical Education and \nProgramming \n2 \nCommunity health 1 Senior organizational \nleader \n1 Research & Assessment 1 \nIndependent \norganization \n3     \nTotals 13  16  16 \n \nThere was also significant demographic diversity in the sample. Table 10 below \nshows the gender and race distribution of my sample, which I assessed independently by \nusing publicly available profiles with photographs on the internet. My independent \nassessment was based upon my interpretation, as a White, cisgender man, of prevailing \ncultural norms regarding the visible signs of gender and race designation. This independent \nassessment of race and gender was confirmed by self-designation for 14 of the 16 \nparticipants in their responses to the interview question regarding social identities. Of the \n87 \n \n \n \nremaining two participants, one designated their gender, which confirmed my independent \nassessment, but did not mention a racial identity. The other participant did not self-assess \ntheir race or gender because I did not ask them this question. Neither of these two \nparticipants disconfirmed the independent assessment. \nBased upon my independent assessment, the demographic distribution of racial \nidentity of the sample was comparable with that of Diversity and Inclusion leaders in \nhospitals nationwide (IDHM, 2017). As of 2015, the AHA found that 77% of D&I leaders \nidentified as ‘minorities’ whereas I identified 69% of my sample as either Black/African \nAmerican or Latina/o. It is important to note that the AHA designation of minority did not \nspecify whether their definition of ‘minority’ included or excluded a designation of \n‘underrepresented’.  \nTable 10: Participant race and gender (independent assessment by interviewer), ordered by \nparticipant count (#) \nRace Gender # Percentage \nBlack/African American Women 5 31.3% \nBlack/African American Men 4 25.0% \nWhite Women 3 18.8% \nWhite Men 2 12.5% \nLatina Women 1 6.3% \nLatino Men 1 6.3% \n Total 16 100.0% \n \nThe interviews were conducted over an internet-based meeting platform and lasted \nfrom 45 - 110 minutes, with a mean of 62 minutes. Prior to the interviews, I notified the \nparticipants that the interview would be recorded and I notified them again immediately prior \nto the interview in a preparatory statement (See Appendix A).  Some of the interviewees \n88 \n \n \n \nwere recorded in video and audio and some in audio only. I took handwritten notes and the \ninterviews produced 286 pages of transcript data.  I combined these various data sources and \norganized the results into thematic categories. I then reflected on the process of interviewing \nin order to produce self-reflective data.  \nFindings Grouped by Theme \nBelow I describe the interview data in four broad thematic categories: personal \nidentities and stories, approaches to difference and commonality, general inclusion \napproaches, and effective engagement of White people in workplace inclusion strategies. \nUnder each theme, I list the relevant questions and describe the responses using sub-themes, \ntables, and direct quotations. Because the interviews were semi-structured, I allowed the \nparticipants to co-determine the pacing of the interview. Therefore, not all questions were \nasked to all participants. I also received many answers to questions I had not asked. Under \nsome thematic categories, I discuss and present the numerical count of ‘mentions,’ or \nrelevant statements, by participants that correspond to those themes. Readers should be aware \nthat I coded these statements independently and did not rely upon computer-aided coding of \nthe transcript data or recordings. Therefore, these numerical counts should be considered \napproximate representations of actual response data. I replaced the participants’ names with \ngender-neutral pseudonyms and use gender-neutral pronouns (e.g. they, their) to refer to the \nparticipants.   \nPersonal Identities and Stories \nRelevant questions:  \n● What got you into the work of diversity, equity and inclusion?  \n● Could you tell me about a past experience that has been influential for you?  \n89 \n \n \n \n● Which social identities do you feel most influence your work, and how others perceive \nyour work, in promoting an inclusive workplace? \n In research on fostering diversity and inclusion, numerous scholars have described the \nimportance practitioners (and researchers) knowing and naming their relevant social \nidentities (Helms, 1993; Sue et al., 2010; Rast et al., 2018). These personal attributes create a \nlens through which the leader approaches their work. This is particularly important when the \nwork itself deals directly with issues of difference, workplace equity, and other touchstones \nof the diversity domain. Since the current study deals with White racial identity, it was \ncritical to understand the participants’ relevant social identities, both racial identity and those \nthat intersect with race.   \nThe participants self-designated 58 social identities that they felt either influenced \ntheir own approach to workplace inclusion or influenced how others’ viewed them. In Table \n11 below, I list the identities along with the number of mentions. The most mentioned themes \nwere race, national ancestry, gender, sexuality, class upbringing, and occupational. Some \nparticipants only included more visible identities such as gender, ethnicity, and race, whereas \nsome participants listed many of their less visible identities as well.  \nOne of the most important findings from the social identity question was the large \nnumber of identities that were only mentioned by one (1) participant: 45 identities, or nearly \n78% were mentioned only once. This finding speaks to the diffuse, multitudinous nature of \nsocial identity. Another interesting finding deals with the difference between my independent \nassessment of participant’s race using publicly-available profiles and their self- assessment of \nwhich identities were most influential in their work. While all six (6) of the White \nparticipants cited their Whiteness as influential, only five (5) of the eight (8) African \n90 \n \n \n \nAmerican participants to whom I posed the question about identities mentioned their Black \nidentity24. The Latina/o participants did not use the words “Latina” or “Latino”, but instead \nmentioned their parents’ Latin American country of origin.2526  \n   \n                                                 \n24 Two of the African American participants did not specific their racial identity in response to my question. For \nthe other participant that did not specify their identity, I had not asked them the question about identities. \n25 See Language Notes in chapter 1 for an explanation of the use of gender-neutral pronouns. \n26 I did not provide a citation for this statement in order to protect the identity of the participants. \n91 \n \n \n \nTable 11: Self-designated social identities that participants believed influenced their work or \nhow others perceive their work, sorted by number (#) of mentions \nSocial Identities # Social Identities # Social Identities # \nWhite 6 Elder or \"Old\" 1 Raised in city 1 \nWoman 6 Bisexual 1 California raised 1 \nBlack or African American 5 \n\"In another era, probably \nbisexual\" 1 Raised by single parent 1 \nHeterosexual or Straight 4 Cognitively Different 1 Safety net hospital 1 \nMan 3 ADHD 1 Cardiologist 1 \nCisgender 3 Geek 1 Academic 1 \nChild of immigrants 3 \"American\" nationality 1 \nWoman in male-\ndominated workplace 1 \nFirst gen. college  3 Immigrant 1 \nWorked in toxic \nworkplace 1 \nCaribbean 2 English language speaker 1 Young Dean 1 \nParent 2 Jewish 1 Multi-disciplinary training 1 \nRaised in lower SES home 2 Seventh Day Adventist 1 Lawyer by training 1 \nActivist 2 Agnostic or Atheist 1 Diversity Expert 1 \nPhysician 2 Descendent of slaves 1 Mentor 1 \nMulti-generational Black 1 \nChild of Holocaust \nsurvivors 1 Low SES grad student 1 \nBiracial 1 Child of Black activists 1 Educated 1 \nHonduran-American 1 Child of labor activists 1 High income and wealth 1 \nParent of child on spectrum 1 Child bully 1 Well-travelled 1 \nParent of child was bullied 1 Child of physicians 1 Safe home neighborhood 1 \nGrandparent of biracial \nchildren 1 Raised in all-White town 1   \nYouthful appearance 1 \nRaised in black and brown \nneighborhood 1   \n \n92 \n \n \n \nThese social identities connected to the life stories of the participants. Finley’s \ncomments are a good example of numerous participants’ regarding formative childhood \nexperience:  “...growing up in the city of [redacted], [I] was aware of some of the stark \ndifferences in the neighborhoods and also in people's level of quality of life and wellness. At \na very young age, I was curious as to why are there such drastic differences” (personal \ncommunication, March 22, 2019). Similarly, Deandre recalls their experience in high school \nsports: “One very tangible example and thing I always remember is we had a dirt track at my \nhigh school, and I ran track and played football. We would go to other schools, 90%, 95% of \nwhich had all weather tracks. That being a very tangible sort of and visual example of asking \nyourself, why is this?” (personal communication, February 25). In addition to noticing \ndisparities, Robin describes early experiences of activism: “[my work promoting diversity \nand inclusion started with] the work that I had done in social justice my whole life from the \ntime I was a teenager, starting with doing civil rights work, then anti-war work then work \nwith the farm workers union” (personal communication, February 11, 2019). Other \nparticipants cited later experiences in their professional lives as influential in their journey to \nworkplace inclusion leader. I found Dionne’s story particularly relevant to the topic of the \ncurrent research:  \n...my main professional field...is tobacco use prevention and treatment...And \ntobacco, from being so embedded in US history...and the fact that slavery \nbeing used to grow tobacco as America's great cash crop for so long, on \nthrough to the targeted advertising that has really [creates] a vector for the \ntobacco epidemic [in] populations that are already marginalized (personal \ncommunication, March 1, 2019). \n93 \n \n \n \nAs this quote demonstrates, the participant’s stories demonstrate the powerful \nconnections, at the individual and collective levels, between personal experience, social \ndisparity, and economic reality. These connections can also be seen in the intersectional \nnature of the participants’ social identities. \nOverall Approaches to Workplace Inclusion \nRelevant Questions:  \n● How would you describe your overall approach to promoting an inclusive healthcare \nworkplace?  \n The participants addressed this open-ended question about their overall approach in \ntwo general ways: interpersonal descriptions of inclusion and organizational inclusion \nstrategies. Participants discussed three (3) interpersonal themes and 14 organizational themes \nregarding their approach to inclusion. Table 12 below lists all the interpersonal themes and \nthe nine most mentioned organizational themes. Under this and subsequent thematic sections, \nI discuss and present the numerical count of ‘mentions,’ or relevant statements, by \nparticipants that correspond to those themes. Readers should be aware that I coded these \nstatements independently and did not rely upon computer-aided coding of the transcript data. \nTherefore, these numerical counts should be considered approximate representations.   \n  \n94 \n \n \n \nTable 12: General approaches to workplace inclusion: interpersonal descriptions and \norganizational strategies, ordered by count (#) \nInterpersonal Inclusion Descriptions # \nAuthentic Felt experience 6 \nInterpersonal Relationships, Empathy \n \n6 \nBelonging \n \n2 \nOrganizational Inclusion Strategies (top 9 themes) # \nTraining \n \n8 \nHolistic, Aligned Strategy and Tactics \n \n6 \nUsing Science, Research, Assessment \n \n6 \nInclusive Culture/Climate 5 \nDiversity recruitment & retention \n \n5 \nEducation, professional \n \n4 \nEducation, general employee 3 \nGoals & Targets \n \n3 \nBusiness and Performance Case as primary driver 3 \n \nOn the interpersonal level, six of the 16 participants mentioned the importance of \ninclusion as a felt experience and that it revolved around interpersonal relations. Sydney’s \nresponse is an apt summary of this theme: “Yes, so for me, [inclusion] is a feeling. It's \ncreating an organizational culture where people feel valued, where people feel respected, and \nrespect is kind of a subjective thing” (personal communication, February 7, 2019). For \n95 \n \n \n \nFrancis, inclusive leadership starts with self: “...I would love to take people through truly \nwhat I call inner work. And so inner work is who am I? How do I see myself through my \nidentity lens?” (personal communication, February 25, 2019). Emery went further in \nstressing the importance of healthcare leaders taking on internal development in order to \neffectively promote inclusion:  \nHealthcare systems have been working on this issue for the last 40 years, have made \nvery little progress. I always ask why? And lots of times, it's because the mindset of \nthe leaders is not aligned with the tactics that they're trying to implement and they \ndon't know it, whether it's unconscious bias, whether it's a lack of competency. Our \nwork is largely at the personal level, at the leadership behavior level. For me, it's the \nfoundation piece that has to be addressed (personal communication, February 12, \n2019). \nFour participants used metaphors for describing inclusion and associated \nconcepts, including Robin, who stated, “Dr. [name redacted] has said for years that \ndiversity is being invited to the dance and inclusion is actually being allowed to \ndance. I like to say that belonging is when you get to actually choose some of the \nmusic.” Robin was joined by two others in connecting empathy with inclusion. \nEmpathy, as a key mode of interrelating, was a critical concept in connecting \nprofessional training of clinicians with healthcare inclusion. Two quotations \ndemonstrate this point: “Relationships to self, to patients, to peers, and to the wider \nsociety. We say that the physician is tasked with managing, negotiating, mediating \nthose four critical relationships” (Lane, personal communication, February 20, 2019); \n“[I published an article on] inclusion as a core competence to professionalism. I've \n96 \n \n \n \nspoken about professionalism and wellness and inclusion being in overlapping \nspaces” (Zari, personal communication, February 13, 2019).  \n While the responses regarding interpersonal issues, most of the participant \nresponses to my question about inclusion approach dealt with organizational \nstrategies and tactical interventions. The training theme was the most commonly cited \n(7 mentions), closely followed by the importance of a holistic, embedded, aligned \ninclusion strategy (6 mentions) and using science, research, and assessment in the \nwork (6 mentions). Participants mentioned two general types of training: leadership \ntraining and general training around inclusion and associated issues. For example: \n“[we] provide training for ‘leading for the future’ or ‘leadership 2020’, which at its \ncore is unconscious bias training” (Jo, personal communication, April 8, 2019); “The \npenny exercise in particular is pretty galvanizing” (Dionne); “We mandate diversity \nand cultural adaptability training for all employees. That includes CEO on down \n(Deandre).”  \nOn the strategic level, participants discussed “goals that are enterprise wide”, \n“taking a holistic approach”, and ensuring that “our priorities are aligned with the \nplan of this school and the university” (Sydney; Robin; Quinn, personal \ncommunication, April 8, 2019). The concept of embedding inclusion strategy is \nconnected to the concept of inclusion as a cultural project. Robin underlines the \nnecessity of looking beyond the diversity numbers: “...are we really willing to look at \ndiversifying the very nature of the culture to make it more, to have it take more \nadvantage of everything that different people have to offer?” Lonnie echoed this \nsentiment in saying, “the goal we hope to achieve is a culture change. Culture change \n97 \n \n \n \nthat respects more inclusivity” (personal communication, March 4, 2019). Jo \ncommented that the leaders they work with are aware and accepting of the need for \ngreater inclusiveness, but “the question is, ‘How do I shift my culture?’”. Emery sums \nthis up with a metaphor: “I also equate ‘D & I’ [with] safety, [as in] \nmanufacturing...D & I is the same thing. It's a permanent mindset that overlays \neverything else within an organizational system”. \nWhile arguing that inclusivity transcends numerical data, participants cited \nusing objective assessment based on “sound scientific and social theory” (Lonnie) as \na cornerstone of developing embedded inclusion strategies. The most commonly cited \nassessments were “diversity engagement survey”, “climate assessment”, and various \nmeasures to determine the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups \n(Oakley, personal communication, March 25, 2019; Jo). Several participants also \nrelated the use of objective assessment to their overall strategy of setting goals and \ntargets. For example, Deandre described goals for leader recruitment, diversity \nclimate, and “purchasing … from a diverse supplier standpoint.” Lonnie’s goal was \nclearly stated as “increase by 50% the [medical school] faculty representation [of \nunderrepresented racial and ethnic groups] over three to five years”.  \nIn fact, at least five (5) of the participants reported that they were held directly \naccountable, at least in part, for increasing the percentages of women and \nunderrepresented racial and ethnic groups at their institution (Zari, Jamie, Lonnie, \nOakley, Quinn). Therefore, at a practical and operational level, these and other \nparticipants reported that the work of creating an inclusive workplace is inseparable \nfrom the work of increasing representational diversity. \n98 \n \n \n \nSeven participants mentioned professional training and general employee \neducation programs as key organizational strategies. Harper’s two major \nundergraduate nursing courses dealing in health equity and quality were designed to \n“[challenge students] to understand that the patients that they take care of come with a \nset of experiences that are important.” Lane also discussed holistic diversity and \ninclusion curriculum for medical students focusing “on diversity in its broadest sense, \nbut making sure that we keep in mind the historical notions, around diversity, \nparticularly racial and ethnic minorities that are underrepresented in medicine.” For \nhospital-wide employee education, Sydney’s activities were emblematic of many \nparticipants’ work in this area: their primary duty was to “develop the… diversity \neducation plan and put in place diversity education modules, train the trainer \nprograms, cultural awareness events and heritage month celebrations”.  \nIn response to the overall approach question, Participants 11 and 14 stressed \nthe importance of nesting workplace inclusion within the overall strategies of, \nrespectively, business and organizational performance. After describing the major \ndemographic shift in the US away from a White majority, Lonnie pointed out, “So if \nwe are in fact to have a strategy that is economically viable going forward and if \nbusiness enterprises, particularly in healthcare, are going to be a true growing \nconcern, they necessarily have to accommodate a very new clientele, a very new \ncustomer.” In terms of how the business of healthcare should serve the increasingly \ndiverse “customer” or patient cohort, both Lonnie, Marques, and Oakley mentioned \nthe phrase, “organizational excellence.” Oakley’s comments along these lines are an \napt summation of this approach:  \n99 \n \n \n \nwe recently adopted the approach of inclusive excellence, the idea that every \nindividual's background and unique abilities and talents and various identities \nreally does contribute to making the workplace a better place and looking \nfrom the institutional lens to be able to leverage those unique qualities that \nindividuals bring in order to maximize the ability to create those outputs that \nare mission driven for us. \nApproach to Identity, Difference and Commonality  \n● How would you describe your approach in helping employees with various \nidentities to think about their commonalities and what makes them different? \nFollowing up on the question regarding their personal identities, I asked the \nparticipants to discuss their approach, given the variety of identities at play, to \nworking with employees on differences and commonalities. The responses were \nhighly varied across topics and overlapping. Below I present them in four major \nthemes: highlight and managing difference and intersectionality, highlight common \nexperience including bias, highlight organizational and professional goals, manage \ncomplexity and intersectionality, and downplay differences (See Table 13).  \nTable 13: Approaches to identity, difference, and commonality, top four themes by count (#) \nApproach # \nHighlight and managing difference and \nintersectionality \n12 \nHighlight common experience including bias \n \n6 \nHighlight organizational and professional goals \n \n4 \nDownplay differences, including race 3 \n100 \n \n \n \n \nTwelve participant’s responses were descriptions of how their organization \nhighlights and helps employees manage difference and intersectional identities. In \ntheir regular diversity and inclusion training, Sydney’s organization uses an exercise \nwith “an identity wheel that talks about primary characteristics, secondary \ncharacteristics, and organizational characteristics… So you're bringing into any \ninteraction, primary, secondary, organizational, institutional, societal identity \nstructures… [the issue of] identity… as an intersectionality, plays into our monthly \nprograms.” Similarly, Finley uses ”some group exercises that we do if we, for \nexample, in some of CNEs or the training where we have people step into a circle as \nwe call off different identities… We may say African-American, we may say single \nparent, we may say raised in a middle-class family, or LGBTQ ally.  It also really \nhighlights the intersectionality of our identities.” Rather than have employees \ndesignate their own identities in a group, Deandre plays a guessing game wherein he \nasks the crowd to guess, ‘“where do you think I grew up, where I live now. Am I \nmarried? Do I have kids? What's my racial and ethnic background?\" People have a lot \nof fun with this, myself included. Then, they break up into pairs and play with each \nother.’ Dionne’s program uses ‘the penny exercise’, a workshop based upon Peggy \nMcIntosh’s work which seeks to educate the attendees on privilege. This requires \nparticipants to locate stations around the room that correspond to privilege statements \nthat describe their life, such as “I can be reasonably sure that the police are there to \nprotect me and people like me.” Each station has pennies that participants place in a \nsmall sack. At the end, participants could their pennies and stand up when the number \nrange that corresponds to their number is called. Rather than running workshops with \n101 \n \n \n \nbroad appeal, Emery reported focusing on training leaders to manage four \n“paradoxes” that vex (largely White men) leaders in the US: sameness and difference, \nindividual and collective, claiming group membership without losing individuality, \nand challenge and support.  \nSix participants chose to accentuate their employees’ commonalities in the \nrealm of workplace inclusion, including their shared experience of having biases and \na common organizational mission. Robin describes their organization’s evolution of \nfocus from difference to commonality:  \nif I'm sitting here and leading a session and I emphasize to people that I'm \ntelling White people, \"You'll never understand what is to be black.\" And I'm \ntalking to a man and saying, \"You'll never understand what it is to be a \nwoman\", we always thought that that kind of would wake people up to see \nthat they had to learn it. But now we can actually watch the way the brain was \nresponding and what we would see is that the empathy centers of the brain \nwould diminish when we would do this and their defensive posture would \ncome up. So when you say to somebody, \"You'll never understand what it is \nto be such and such\", rather than wanting to understand more, they actually \nget more protective and defensive. And that was really at the core of \nbeginning to change some of our strategies. And so what we began to see was \nthat if instead of doing that, we would say, \"Well, I've got bias about this \nissue. You may have bias about another issue, but we've all got bias.\"  \nSimilarly, Marques reported going away from having people call out their \nidentities “because I think in the context of most trainings, people don't really know \n102 \n \n \n \neach other, and they may not [want to reveal sensitive information about \nthemselves].” Instead, Marques’ workshops have attendees take an IAT [Implicit \nAssociation Test], reflect on it, and then go through another bias association exercise \nas a group. This helps employees understand that “bias is ubiquitous” and to help \n“people talk about race.” This common ground theme is echoed by Zari and Lonnie, \nbut with a focus on organizational goals. As Zari responded, “I think just having a \ndiscussion about what is the common purpose of the group or the organization [is a \ngood start]. And then building from that common purpose the rationale for bringing \ntogether diverse perspectives to enhance the purpose or to drive the purpose.” To \nparticipants, the commonality that speaks to the most immediate concerns of \nemployees is around their professional development. Quinn communicates this \nthrough the lens of self-actualization: “I approach things as everyone in our \nenvironment, wants to feel valued, wants to feel that they're able to contribute, wants \nto feel that their potential can be recognized… And that's both from the custodian and \nthe security guard to the scientist in the lab.” Likewise, Lane, as a curricular leader in \na medical school, stresses the student’s common ground as doctors-in-training \nworking to build their humility and core relationships, which help them understand \nthe relevant social, cultural, and power structures to doctoring.  \nIn addition to their advocacy for establishing common ground in the \norganizational goals, Lonnie advocated against a focus on focusing on different \nidentities because this would “[allow] each group to formulate its own lens through \nwhich it sees diversity and inclusion… if you allow a cultural separation, there's only \nso much progress that can be made.” Lonnie went on to state, “the whole point of the \n103 \n \n \n \nexistence of diversity and inclusion initiatives is to mute, M-U-T-E, the significance \nof the self-assignment of race or ethnicity.” Robin and Harper also discuss \ndownplaying the significance of race due to the sensitivity it invokes, but they do not \nclaim that this strategy is a core tenet of workplace inclusion.  \nEffective Engagement of White People in Workplace Inclusion Strategies \n● Do you have any questions before we begin? \n● When you think about effectively engaging White people in healthcare \nworkplace inclusion strategies, what are some thoughts you have? \n● What behaviors would indicate to you that the White employees in your \norganization are fully engaged in helping create an inclusive workplace? \n● Based upon your experience and expertise, how might you recommend a new \nhealthcare leader go about creating an inclusion strategy that fully engages \nWhite people? \n In the responses to these four questions, the participants revealed their \nviewpoint on the central topic of the research - effective engagement of White people \nin workplace inclusion strategies. I divided this section into three themes: (1) support \nfor, objection to, or no reaction to the research topic, (2) interpersonal issues of \nsupporting White engagement, and (3) organizational strategies to support White \nengagement.  \nSupport, objection/concern, or neutral reactions to the research topic. \nIn their responses to the first question following my reading of the preparatory \nstatement and continuing throughout the interview, participants voiced support, \nobjection or concern, or voiced neither support nor objection/concern to my framing \n104 \n \n \n \nof the research topic. Table 14 below shows the distribution of these reactions. There \nare several important caveats related to these findings. First, voicing support or \nconcern does not preclude the existence of either sentiment being experienced by the \nparticipants. A participant voicing support or concern does not imply that the \nparticipant experienced 100% support for or concern with the topic. Similarly, if the \nparticipant did not voice support or concern, this does imply that they experienced \neither sentiment. Last, that a participant objected to an aspect of the research topic \ndoes not imply an objection to the entire project. Indeed, for a senior leader or \nconsultant to agree to a one hour interview is reasonable evidence of overall support \nfor the endeavor.  \nTable 14: Participant reactions to the research topic \nReaction # \nDid not voice support or objection/concern 9 \nSupport 4 \nObjection/Concern  3 \n  \n Nine participants did not voice support or object/concern with the framing of \nthe research topic. Four participants mentioned support for the research topic, \neffective engagement of White people in workplace inclusion. The supportive \nstatements included, “you're on the right track to get us some good stuff” (Oakley), \n“...don’t hesitate to send me a note...I've enjoyed the conversation a lot” (Robin), and \n“your work is very exciting and will be a great addition to these efforts” (Finley).  \nThere were three participants that voiced a concern or objection. All three \nexpressed their concerns or objections at the beginning, following the reading of my \n105 \n \n \n \npreparatory statement (see Appendix A).  I consider them critically important data \npoints. Therefore, I have provided extended quotations of each concern or objection. \nFirst, Zari: \nYeah, I have a little bit of a concern about the title. So I'm not comfortable with that. \nSo I don't know if there's an alternative working title, but every time you reference it, \nit's a little bit uncomfortable...Well, I think that certainly these days we think more \nabout ancestry as opposed to White and Black. So ancestry would be I think a better \nterm because certainly, there's only one human race....Yeah, European ancestry would \nbe a better term at least in my view. \nZari expressed a concern with the title of the research including the ‘White’ racial \ndesignation.  Their preference would have been to use “European” ancestry-based \ndesignation.  \nLonnie did not voice a concern regarding use of racial language, although they did criticize \nthe preparatory statement as “inflammatory”. This criticism came packaged with a \nrecommendation from Lonnie regarding my research methodology: \n Was there any attempt to kind of have balance between major academic centers, \nmoderate academic centers, community not-for-profit centers, traditionally minority \ncenters? What was that thought process? [I answer this question] So I only bring that \nup because I think it helps establish some context. As one might imagine, a topic that \nbegins with almost an inflammatory entree is going to generate a set of responses \nthat will depend upon the day-to-day activities in a given center. \nAt this stage, I was curious to hear more about Lonnie’s reason for choosing the \nword, “inflammatory”, but I prioritized moving forward with the interview. However, \n106 \n \n \n \nLonnie’s response to my second question, How would you describe your formal and informal \nresponsibilities in [diversity and inclusion] work, brought us back to his initial reaction to my \nresearch topic:  \nLonnie: Yeah. So I'm happy to answer that. But I think it would not be fair if \nwe don't address the construct that you've outlined with the sentence that you brought \nforward. \nKen:  Sure. \nLonnie: The fact that we're having a discussion that uniquely focuses on \neffective engagement of White people in workplace inclusion strategies is in and of \nitself a pause moment because the whole point of the existence of diversity and \ninclusion initiatives is to mute, M-U-T-E, the significance of the self-assignment of \nrace or ethnicity of either of the groups that might be involved in a particular \nworkplace environment. As long as we continue to articulate race as a descriptor of \nthose that are participating in improvement and quite frankly those that are targeted, \nwe continue to end up with somewhat polarizing views, and we perpetuate these \ndifferences that are stratified by race and ethnicity rather than ameliorate and \namalgamate the population. So we have a better sense of who's under, at least in our \nsense, healthcare, who's under our care. \nLonnie: To be very explicit, I don't think it's wise to think about an effective \nengagement strategy for White persons and an effective engagement strategy for \nHispanic persons and an effective engagement strategy for persons of African descent \nbecause that necessarily means that you are allowing each group to formulate its own \nlens through which it sees diversity and inclusion. One of the strategies that leads to a \n107 \n \n \n \nsuccessful diversity and inclusion space is a strategy that's built around cultural \ncompetence. But if you allow a cultural separation, there's only so much progress that \ncan be made. \nLonnie: I think the key consideration for any dialogue you have with anyone \nwho is a participant partner must necessarily be what is the greater good in having \nthese efforts, that is what appeals to everyone. No one is going to lose their identity \nbeing engaged in diversity and inclusion, but everyone will seek what constitutes real \nvalue. \nLonnie’s statements continued as he explicated his view on the correct framing of \nworkplace inclusion - the ‘business case’ given the country’s demographic shift toward a \nmore racially and ethnically diverse, non-White (my wording) majority. This exchange \ngenerated many important self-reflective insights concerning the strategic and interpersonal \ndynamics surrounding my salient identities as a researcher, particularly race, those of the \nparticipants, and the weighty choices confronting leaders of healthcare workplace inclusion \nin terms of strategy and strategic messaging (See Personal Reflections in chapter 5). For the \npurposes of this section, the primary finding with Lonnie’s reaction to my research topic is \nthat they objected to my implication, by choosing this topic and interviewing practitioners on \nit, that focusing on White engagement in workplace inclusion was an important concern. \nLonnie argued that, at some level, that a focus in any particular group, people with White \nracial identity or privilege included, was at best, an unwelcome distraction from a more \nefficient and effective strategy. Lonnie confirmed my interpretation of his reaction to my \nresearch topic in a follow up following email later the same day:  \nKen, \n108 \n \n \n \nThank you for the inclusion. \nOne more thought- it is important for me to make certain that the emphasis on \n(White) race is muted. In nearly every public discourse, once race enters the \ndiscussion, all progress stops and acrimony begins. It is indeed a four letter word and \nis both halting and counterproductive. Given the contemporary associations with \n“White” race, that concept becomes especially halting. \nThe notion of developing an “inclusion” strategy for any given race or ethnicity is by \ndefinition contrary to the premise of inclusion. That is especially the case for “White” \nleaders/employees. A goal of our work is to reduce the impact of stereotypes; \nfocusing on the needs of White leaders/employees only endorses the already extant \nstereotypes. \nI am of the mindset that change as drive by a social justice imperative and now an \nemerging business objective is sufficient. Given the rapidly changing demographics \nin this country, those who wish to engage will be on the forefront of change and will \nserve as change (maybe even “choice”) architects. With sufficient “diversity of \nthought” created by persons that are representative of all stakeholders, including \nWhite professionals and patients, we will evolve a very different workspace and a \nvery different, more equitable, approach to health and healthcare. \nBest wishes with your work \n[Lonnie] (March 4, 2019) \nThe follow up email confirmed that, in contrast to Zari’s concern regarding use of the \nword, “White”, Lonnie’s objection was more fundamental. Additionally, his objection \ncompelled him to step outside the normal bounds of research subject to explicitly direct me \n109 \n \n \n \ntoward, what he believed strongly, was a more useful frame for my research. This behavior \nalso follows my intention in the preparatory statement that interviewees, as ‘participant-\npartners’ would ‘get to contribute to and benefit from the research process’ (see Appendix \nA). \n Quinn had a similar critique to the research topic, although their comments were more \ncircumspect than those of Lonnie, made later in the interview, and in response to a direct \nquestion about effective engagement of White people:  \nSo, I looked at your question, and I actually [inaudible - perhaps “felt”] [somewhat] \ndifficult, that's not the correct word. Difficult thing to answer, because I don't think \nit's what is it White people do versus Asian people do or black people do. And what \npeople do and I think that one of the difficulties, we can have some time when we try \nto lump everybody into a bucket. So, me, when you describe yourself in your identity, \nit's not a White identity that everybody shares, it's your unique identity, set of \nidentities. And so I think one of the issues for me is not to think of it is for me, as I \ndon't really think of this is how do I engage White employees in the work of our \norganization? I think of it as how do I engage the employees of students, the members \nof our organization in the work of our organization, understanding that each one \ncomes with this very differently? Each one has different perspective, each one has \ntheir own set of biases, their own set of issues that come together. And stress that \nmore than White people do this, or Asian people do that. I just think it's a healthier \napproach. \nLike Lonnie, Quinn communicated that focusing on engaging any one racial identity is not \non their agenda of workplace inclusion, at least explicitly. \n110 \n \n \n \nInterpersonal issues in effective engagement. \n  The participants described many salient issues regarding interpersonal aspects of \neffective engaging White people in workplace inclusion. I drew out four relevant themes \nregarding this topic: exceptionality of engaging White racial identity or racial identity in \ngeneral, particular challenges associated with engaging White people, positive identity \ndevelopment in general and White ally identity development specifically, and psychological \nsafety (See Table __). Due to the participants’ wide ranging comments on this issue, the data \nfor number of mentions contains overlap. For example, the mentions for the general issue of \nexceptionality has overlap with several others listed in Table 15.  \nTable 15: Participant mentions (#) of interpersonal themes in effective engagement of White \npeople in workplace inclusion \nInterpersonal issue  # \nExceptionality of engaging people with White identity  9 \nChallenges or lack of challenge of White engagement \n \n9 \nPsychological Safety: Build trust and avoid blame, shame, guilt \n \n7 \nPositive Identity, Relationship, & White Ally Development \n \n7 \n \n Exceptionality of engaging people with White identity. \n Nine participants mentioned the issue of whether employees with White racial \nidentity were apt to need different treatment than other groups in the development of \nstrategies to engage employees in workplace inclusion. Emery describes how many senior \nleadership groups, mostly White, “don't know that they're a group and don't know that they \nset the organizational norms and rules. It's...not the majority group necessarily, but it's \n111 \n \n \n \nwhatever the dominant group is that establishes the cultural norms in a system”. Likewise, \nDeandre stresses the outsized opportunity in engaging White leadership: \n...the first thought that comes to mind is that there is a lot of power and opportunity \nthat folks with that [White] identity hold, whether they know it or not. I think if there \nare opportunities to really harness that in a way that help individuals that are more \nmarginalized in lots of different ways, to really be champions and allies, it has the \npotential to really impact organizations like this one in terms of their culture, and then \nin their provision of service to others. \n Similarly, Jo’s response to the question about effective engagement of White people \ndealt with the strategic nature of White positionality: “Well, for the most part, multiculturals \nare different from the White power structure, that's where the difference lies”. In contrast, \nQuinn gave voice to the view White racial identity is not exceptional: “...I don't think it's \nwhat is it White people do versus Asian people do or black people do. [It’s] what people do”. \nLonnie goes further to state that White racial identity or racial identity in general, should not \nbe accentuated: “We can spend our time trying to re-engineer labels and to revisit how we are \nself-described, or we can recognize that we have a history that is very diverse, and we come \nfrom heterogeneous experiences”.  \nParticular challenges involved in engaging White people in workplace inclusion. \n Nine participants mentioned particular challenges involved in engaging White people \nin workplace inclusion. Six participants mentioned the challenge of White people feeling \nexcluded from inclusion work or were not participating in as great numbers as hoped \n(Sydney, Robin, Emery, Zari, Harper, Oakley). As a result, as Oakley commented, “In my \nexperience doing this work we often will I think have a similar thing that I've heard over in \n112 \n \n \n \nmy career is we end up singing to the choir meaning that we have these topics and usually the \nfolks who are in the room are non-dominant group members.” Robin provided one \nexplanation for the lack of White participation: “...so much of the diversity conversation for \nso many years was aimed at White people...And even in our language, I mean how many \ntimes have you heard somebody describe employees of color as diverse employees? ….I \nmean diverse employees is everybody.” Emery posits the lower participation in part to a \nstruggle for Whites, and men in particular, to connect diversity and inclusion priorities with \ntheir “vested self-interest.” Oakley voiced their interest in addressing the issues of \nmicroaggression and fragility, but did not provide details.  \n Emery discussed at length the challenges inherent in commonly held White views on \nsimilarity and difference:  \n“In the US in particular, there's a tendency at a cultural level, particularly for \nWhites to focus on sameness at the expense of difference...I was with a [White \nleader] Saturday night. [He said] ‘I don't see skin color. I treat everybody the \nsame.’ I said, ‘What you don't see as a White person is that you're telling that \nperson as long as you fit in my world - you act White, think White, talk \nWhite, basically, be White - we're good.’ From an individualistic standpoint, \nlots of times for Whites, when they hear their colleagues of color talk about \nsome of the struggles that they face because of simply the complexion of their \nskin...They hear it as a personal attack when it's not meant as a personal \nattack. It becomes personal, particularly when the White person continues to \nsort of protest and take it very personally...There's a tendency lots of times for \nWhites to not challenge and support other Whites. They're waiting for the \n113 \n \n \n \nperson on the team when something goes down a little bit iffy. They're \nlooking for that one black person to say, \"Was that offensive to you?\" \nFinley describes the challenge of White employees in workshops admitting their \nsocietal advantages relative to non-Whites: “I think it's the [idea of] unearned \nadvantage that kind of is difficult for [White employees]. They often will go back to \npointing out that, ‘Well my ancestors came over ... [emigrated] from Europe with two \ndollars in their pocket and they worked hard and accomplished a lot’. Finley goes on \nto reflect on what she perceived as over-sensitivity on behalf of the White workshop \nattendees: “I remember when we're doing these talks and sometimes the organizer of \nthe talks would come up to me and say, ‘We're so glad you're here, but we just want \nyou to kind of be a little gentle because we don't want to make people feel too guilty’. \n The issues of sensitivity to issues of race, power, and privilege also connected, \nin the responses of participants, to the impact of contemporary social and political \nevents on interpersonal issues of workplace inclusion. Participant responses regarding \nthe societal and social context for their work ranged from the euphemistic (“the \ncurrent climate” or “current political situation”) to the more direct (“after the election, \npeople were a bit freaked out”) to the polemical (“the racist-in-chief… has \nencouraged racist and xenophobic hate [speech]”) (Marques). Most participants \ndiscussed the negative consequences of the societal context. After the presidential \nelection of 2016, Deandre’s health system ran special educational sessions for groups \nthat were concerned about being targeted, included “LGBT people wondering, ‘is my \nsame sex marriage going to be upheld?’” and hospital staff wondering if \nundocumented patients would need extra support. In 2016 and 2017, Lane reported \n114 \n \n \n \nthat his medical students had a “big” negative reaction (“they killed me in reviews”) \nto his usage of a real-life example of an unconscious patient in the ER who, as his \ndoctors discovered after opening his shirt, had a large “racist tattoo” across his chest. \nLane used this as an opportunity for students to explore their reactions, both cognitive \nand emotional, to the patient, and to question their own snap judgements about patient \nchoices. While intended to be an exercise in empathy, checking bias, and humility, \nLane decided to remove it from the curriculum because the content became such a \ndistraction. Despite these negative experiences, some interviewees saw “a silver \nlining” to the current societal climate around race (Finley). Two participants felt that \nthe increased exposure of racist incidents and policies resulted in more conversations \nabout race (Finley and Marques). Emery felt that the country “retrenching on race” \nprovided extra motivation to do the work of creating more diverse, inclusive \nworkplaces as it served as an “anecdote” of sorts to the societal situation.  \nIn contrast to those participants that reported significant challenges, Lonnie pointed to \nevidence at their institution that White involvement in workplace inclusion issues was not \nposing a challenge:  \n I am happy to tell you that the majority of persons who attend those events, those \nprograms, are not minorities, but they are non-minorities or White individuals, \npersons of European descent...That critical mass of people doing the [health equity] \nwork is way over represented by persons of European descent or White physicians, \nWhite practitioners, White investigators.  \nBecause Lonnie saw strong participation from people with White racial identity, this \nbolstered his view that focusing on White engagement represented a well-intentioned, but \n115 \n \n \n \nperhaps ill-advised “social re-engineering” project. Rather, they argued that workplace \ninclusion leaders were better advised to focus on the higher, common organizational goal of \n“economic security”. For, “once we begin to talk about the fact that patients we will be \nserving, communities we will be serving, will be very different demographically, that \nchanges the whole [economic] model and causes many more people to be engaged, willfully, \nreluctantly, doesn't matter. That's the new business model going forward, everyone has to be \ninvolved” (Lonnie). \nPsychological safety: build trust and avoid blame, shame, guilt \nSeven participants described the importance of creating psychological safety for \nWhite people in workplace inclusion work. This safe space is created by facilitating dialogue \n“truly without blame, shame or guilt” and communicating that “isn't about White people are \nthe enemy or if you're White, you're racist” (Francis, Sydney). Finley echoes, “The other \nthing that we really try to emphasize is that we need to have safe spaces to talk about race. \nPart of that has to be people have to be able to be vulnerable and say things out loud that are \nuncomfortable, and we have to show respect towards each other”. In order to reduce the \nsense of individual blame, Dionne points to the importance of “taking the individual burden \noff of people, to illustrate, we're in this societal milieu, where we've all been programmed \nwith these implicit rules. And what we want to do is make those rules explicit.”  \nPositive development of identity, relationship, and ally behavior. \nSeven participants discussed themes of positive identity development, positive \nrelationship development, and helping White employees to be effective allies of the \nworkplace inclusion agenda. To Zari, diversity and inclusion leadership must help people be \nauthentic by “starting the conversation where people are in their appreciation and \n116 \n \n \n \nunderstanding” because “people need a bridge”. Beyond awareness, Emery stresses that \ninclusive leadership development for Whites is also about a “set of competencies about how \nleaders lead across that continuum. That's where we work. What's the behavior and mindset \nthat leaders need to have in order to lead effectively?” To Lane, positive relationships form a \ncritical foundation for inclusion. This is accomplished by “facilitating the student's \ninvolvement in community health and community engagement...It allows us to support \nstudents coming together. We're bringing our talents we're bringing our passion to do \nsomething that's beyond ourselves… at the same time, it speaks to communities of color in \nterms of the services they're providing” (Lane). Quinn sums up a value proposition for \nbuilding relationships across difference in pursuit of inclusion: \n if you want to start a program, you want to start an effort, you want to reach out, to \nwant to create a change. And there are some people who are extremely resistant to \nchange most people are, and then there are individuals who say, ‘I don't get it, it's a \nchange. I'm not necessarily comfortable with it. Let's talk about what it might be’. . . \nAnd so by joining forces and coming together, you're helping what I'm thinking about \nwhat I'm trying to move forward, move forward. But by virtue of our working \ntogether and working with others, we may end up in a slightly different place, but I \nthink it will be a better place. \nNumerous participants discussed the importance of helping White people and others \nwith social privilege to become effective allies or champions, to move from awareness to \nacting in active support of inclusion. To several participants, the foundational behaviors that \nindicated a White employee was engaged were “curiosity,” “willingness to engage in \nconversations,” “body language,” “listening,” and “being willing to understand the life \n117 \n \n \n \nexperience of” non-Whites (Lane; Finley; Zari; Dionne; Robin) . Sydney stressed the \nimportance of champions starting with changing their thinking to “eliminate colorblindness \nas the default” view of race and ethnicity. Marques provides their rationale for developing \nallies: “most of the work that I do is around allies because just the way we're not going to \nsolve gender equity if only women are working on it, we're not going to solve racial and \nethnic group equity and inclusivity if we view it as a problem for underrepresented racial and \nethnic group people.” Likewise, to Sydney, workplace inclusion strategies must “[teach \npeople in the majority], whether it's White, whether it's cis gender, whether it's Christians, \nwhoever your majority is, teaching them how to be effective champions for change”. \nDeandre’s view is that when those employees with more advantaged identities act as \n“sponsor[s],” “champions and allies,” it has the potential to really impact organizations… in \nterms of their culture.” Sydney also touches on the issue of creating cultural value: “the first \nstep in being a champion is making sure the door's open. The second step in being a \nchampion is making sure the people outside of the door are invited into the room. Once you \nhave folks in the room, you want to offer them a seat at the table. Once they have a seat at the \ntable, you want to make sure that their voice is heard. That last step is kind of the one where, \nin my experience, White people get into trouble” because they are not aware of how their \nhabits of communication are a part of the dominant culture. As a result of lacking awareness \nof how White people recreate cultural domination through communication patterns, “[White \nemployees] often not listening or leveraging [non-dominant] perspectives and voices in… \ndecision making” (Sydney).  \nRobin also mentions the importance of “not just jumping in with the answer all the \ntime,” although to them, the cognitive-behavioral aspect of White allyship is only one \n118 \n \n \n \nelement. Robin explained that two other critical elements were one, emotional - “to \nunderstand my own emotional triggers, to understand the emotional triggers of others and to \nbe able to effectively have conversations about those emotions” - and two, “ontological” - \n“what's the filter that we're using to perceive what's going on and how does that filter guide \nwhat we see and what we react to?” The filter of race being the most salient for the interview \ntopic, Robin used the example of “Black Lives Matter.” Black Lives Matter were words \nchosen by activists seeking to expose and end the current and historic overuse of deadly force \nby the police against African Americans. But, because of the typical White ontological filter, \n“most people actually don't understand why it's important to focus on race as a way to \naddress some of the issues…  It just feels like [‘Black Lives Matter’ replaces] one bigotry \nwith another bigotry.” (Robin). This view stems from a lack of “understanding the long term \nnegative impacts of racism and the need to do some correction or reparations to that” \n(Robin).  \nParticipants were pleased to describe organizational allies that seemed to truly \nembrace diversity, equity, and inclusion. Beyond “sponsorship” and “allocating resources,” \nnumerous participants felt very pleased when White leaders would “bring up these issues \nwithout a diversity officer in the room” (Jamie, Deandre, Oakley). For Jamie, a White leader \nat her organization demonstrated his commitment through repeatedly telling a personal story \nabout a workshop demonstrating, in a real time exercise, how representational diversity at the \nteam level results in higher performance. Likewise, Lane and Marques both lauded the ability \nof students with racial advantage to be “vulnerable” by sharing personal, authentic stories \nregarding the relevant topics of diversity and inclusion. Emery went further and described \n119 \n \n \n \ntheir own efforts to show allyship by admitting they did not have answers and felt “confused” \nin the face of the work to creating more racial equity in the workplace.  \nIn contrast to a focus on social and psychological dimensions of supporting inclusion \nstrategies, Lonnie focuses on White engagement with the mission of health equity:  \n“I'm delighted to tell you that champions on this campus, people who have made a \ndeep professional commitment to improve healthcare, have done so by targeting \nimprovement for all… they're saying, \"If we are indeed promoting health and \ntargeting healthcare, if we are to do our job wisely, effectively, we need to embrace \neveryone.\" \nOrganizational strategies and interventions to support White engagement. \n In response to my direct questions about engaging White people in workforce \ninclusion in healthcare, participants responded at the interpersonal level and the \norganizational level. At the organizational level, participants logged at least 25 mentions of \norganizational strategies. I have covered the most mentioned strategies here in two \ncategories: strategic frame and communication and leadership strategies. Since there was \nsignificant overlap in mentions between the categories, I have not provided a table breaking \ndown the specific category.   \nStrategic frame and communication. \nParticipants revealed their strategic frame, or central argument for pursuing diversity \nand inclusion in the workplace, either explicitly by directly addressing the issue, or implicitly \nthrough their word choices and their choice of subject matter. I divided the participants’ \nresponses regarding this subject into three ‘cases’: the healthcare quality case, the business \ncase, and the social justice or anti-racist case. In practical usage, these cases overlap and \n120 \n \n \n \nnumerous participants reported using several cases. Additionally, several participants were \nquick to point out, as Francis mentions, “the strategy should speak to all groups.” Therefore, \nthere is significant overlap between participant responses that were specific to engaging \nWhite employees and those that were not.  \nGiven the industry focus of this study, it is logical that the healthcare quality frame \nwas prominent in at least eight participants’ responses. Healthcare quality involves increasing \nequity of care and lessening “gross disparities” such as “black patients get referred for \ncardiac testing at rates [far less] frequently as White patients do” and “ black women’s \nmortality rate, in… child [birth] at four times [that of] White women (Francis, Dionne). Zari \nand Lane stressed the connection between educating clinicians in inclusive behaviors and \nincreasing quality of care overall. Lane also discussed his mission to “claim ownership of \n[medical student] wellness” in order to train doctors who were capable of delivering \ncompassionate care. Despite the immediate importance of increasing healthcare quality, for \nsome participants, achieving health goals was dependent on stressing the strategic business \nreasons for diversity and inclusion work. Jo states, “I choose to approach this from a business \nperspective, as opposed to a social perspective.” and Lonnie’s view is that, despite the critical \nimportance of addressing healthcare disparities, the business case has not been “stated loudly \nor often enough.” Lonnie later re-states their case, “One part of that greater good is the \nimportance of health equity for all. Hard to argue with that. But an even more compelling, \nmore pragmatic greater good is the business model must continue to be changed.”  \nDespite the importance of the business drivers and healthcare imperative for \nworkplace inclusion, participants also recalled the fundamental issues of justice around the \nwork. Robin commented that, just because bias is a universal human experience, “that doesn't \n121 \n \n \n \nmean that I'm not very cognizant of the fact that from a societal standpoint systemically \nthere's certain people as groups that have suffered more than others.” Dionne wants to reduce \nthe sense that White people are being singled out by getting to  \na clarifying moment where we talk about how we're talking about a system here, and \nit's a system that's been in place for hundreds of years… we're in this societal milieu, \nwhere we've all been programmed with these implicit rules. And what we want to do \nis make those rules explicit, so that we can all examine whether things are fairly \ndistributed based on them or not, and then work towards making things fair and \nequitable so that we are a more just society. \nWhether using the social justice case, the business case or the healthcare case, \nparticipants mentioned the importance of communication and messaging about their \ninclusion strategies. Deandre’s comments on the subject are apt:    \nI think it's figuring out what is important to [people with multiple privileges], and \nhow to package something in a way that people will hear beyond those layered \nidentities. It's sort of audience management, if you will. Because I think that's a pretty \ncritical piece, I've had to do a lot of thinking about, as we share information within \nour organization, how do I share this information with different subgroups? That \nmight be education level… My message tends to be a little bit different with our \nprovider groups versus our medical assistant groups. Medical assistants are going to \nskew younger in age, typically don't have the same level of formal education. \nProvider groups, higher education, higher income, maybe a little bit further removed \nfrom the communities that we're serving. I think the messaging and packaging piece \nbecomes really important to be able to speak to what's important to them, but weave \n122 \n \n \n \nin sort of where the opportunities to start kind of redirecting and creating some new \nexpectations that make sense to folks. \nOakley wanted to do a better job in communication with “dominant group” members \n“crunching the [recruitment] numbers we realize that we didn't do a good job with our \nattendance of White male students for example.” Emery also stressed the importance of \nfinding out the ‘WIIFM’, or ‘what’s in it for me’: “'what incentivizes you? What motivates \nyou? How do you want to be seen?” Oakley also mentions WIIFM: “learning to the… what's \nin it for me kind of approach and understanding where folks are coming from, what leverage \nyou need to think catalyze and it's going to be different for different folks and maybe the \nmessaging a little bit different for different audiences.” Sydney and Robin mentioned another \nkey principle of communication to engage Whites: defining terms. Both participants \ndiscussed the pitfalls of using terms like ‘diverse populations’, ‘inclusion’, and ‘minority’ \nwithout properly defining them in such a way as to avoid exclusionary language.  \nLeadership strategies  \nCommunication would be just one aspect of the many leadership activities that \nparticipants mentioned in their responses. Participant discussions of leadership occurred \nthroughout the interviews, but in particular to the questions directly asking about White \nengagement in workplace inclusion.  Given that White individuals make up a majority of \nsenior leaders in healthcare overall, many of the responses to these questions could be \nconstrued as referring to engaging White leaders, such as the c-suite positions, or White \nemployees overall, whatever their level or function. Participants also discussed their own \nleadership strategies in carrying out a diversity and inclusion agenda that engaged White \nemployees.  \n123 \n \n \n \nSix participants described the importance of organizational leaders, White and \notherwise, incorporating workplace inclusion goals into the organizational strategy. This \nallowed the inclusion leader to “embed” their activities into other functions in order to reach \nvarious audiences, including White employees (Francis). Further, leaders spur action on the \ninclusion strategies by “[encouraging their] team to… align in support of those strategies” \n(Deandre). To at least three participants, this strategic commitment is best matched by a \nmonetary one: “I think where the rubber meets the road is money. We have seen, I have seen \ncommitment from our leadership. Essentially [we were] an office of one person before my \narrival and we're now soon to be six folks” (Oakley). To Participants 4 and 15, these types of \ncommitment are evidence that the leader, White or otherwise, had adopted values in \nalignment of an inclusive workplace. To Robin, another critical starting point is creating the \nvision and the ‘north star’: “What are we trying to create? What's the vision of the \norganization that we want to create? What does that look like? And I mean in detail.” \nAnother indicative behavior mentioned by at least five participants was setting real \ntargets for diversity goals. Jo lauded the efforts of one organization “to tie diversity \nobjectives to performance and to bonus so that your diversity objectives are a part of your \nbonus.” Likewise, Francis recommends “[tying] inclusion goals to individuals from a \nmonetary standpoint and it's a performance-based thing. If we want to transform the \norganization, you write it into policies or procedures, you write it into performance and you \nassess behaviors”. Sydney describes the enormous leadership value of their (White) CEO’s \nleadership of diversity & inclusion:  \n[they] really set the tone and it is communicated and pushed down. So [they] are \nholding [their] executive teams accountable for creating diverse and inclusive \n124 \n \n \n \nworkspaces. That's being done through our internal policies and procedures, so that's \nkind of the system change that [they have] influence over… So since [they have] been \nin [their] role, we've seen a 71% increase in minority executives. They’re doing the \nsame thing with the board, which is kind of a tricky dance. \n At least four participants addressed the leadership behavior of partnering with other \nWhite colleagues and middle managers to achieve inclusion outcomes. Jo, cognizant that \n“middle management can implode any project,” recommends that the “CEO lead a team of \ntalented executives...including some really talented middle managers across the \norganization.” Harper, a mid-senior inclusion leader, was on the receiving end of this sort of \nattention from a C-suite leader who actively sought her counsel, which prompted the \nreflection, “To me, that's a really beautiful example of ways that White people can engage in \nthis work. It's just reaching out.” After assembling their teams, Sydney saw success when the \nC-suite leader “[held their] executive teams accountable for creating diverse and inclusive \nworkspaces.” In praise of similarly bold leadership, Deandre reported seeing model White \nleaders “pushing back on resistance in a way that people of color may not.” Deandre also was \none of three participants to mention sponsorship as a critical White leadership activity. This \nwas described in the form of workplace inclusion leaders sponsoring White participation in \ntheir diversity councils (Robin) and White leaders developing people of color leaders broadly \nin the organization (Deandre, Oakley).   \nSummary of Findings \n Chapter 4 presents the findings from 16 interviews of leaders in healthcare delivery \norganizations and consultants from February to April, 2019. These leaders hailed from \nacademic medical centers, non-academic health systems, community health systems, and \n125 \n \n \n \nindependent organizations. Demographically, based on my independent assessment and \nparticipant self-assessments of social identities, showed a relatively diverse cohort in terms \nof race, gender, class, and many other dimensions. This diversity was confirmed and \nenhanced by the participants’ personal narratives of becoming a leader in healthcare \nworkplace inclusion. With their own identities as a backdrop, the participants then explained \ntheir approaches to identity, commonality and difference. While most participants expressed \nthe view that difference must be highlighted and managed, several participants advocated for \ndownplaying difference in favor of the commonalities of organizational mission, professional \ntraining, or the human condition of bias. The participants then described their overall \napproaches to promoting workplace inclusion. These approaches were both interpersonal and \norganizational, and were highly heterogeneous. The interpersonal themes were the authentic, \nfelt experience of inclusion, the importance of relationships and empathy, and the concept of \nbelonging. Organizational themes included training, holistic and aligned strategies, using \nscience and data, inclusion as a cultural project, diversity recruitment and retention, \nprofessional and general educational strategies, using goals and targets, and focusing on the \nbusiness case for workplace inclusion activities.  \nWhen it came to the central subject of this study, the effective engagement of White \npeople, I focused on three major sub-themes: the participants’ reactions to my research topic, \ninterpersonal issues surrounding White engagement, and organizational strategies. Nine \nparticipants expressed neither support nor concern for the research, four participants \nexpressed support, and three participants expressed a concern or objection. Among the \ninterpersonal issues of White engagement, participants commented on the exceptionality of \nWhiteness in specific and racial identity in general, perception of challenges in White \n126 \n \n \n \nengagement, psychological safety, and development of positive identities, relationships, and \nWhite ally behaviors. At the organizational level, participants provided varying perspectives \non how their framing and communication strategies might engage White employees in \nworkplace inclusion. Specifically, participant responses reflected three cases: healthcare, \nbusiness, and social justice. This Chapter concluded with participants’ thoughts on which \nleadership activities, both by themselves and by senior organizational leaders, might result in \neffectively engaging White people in creating a more inclusive healthcare workplace.    \n  \n127 \n \n \n \nCHAPTER 5 \n \nINTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS \n \n“Here’s my new business case for diversity, equity and inclusion in healthcare: When we \ndon’t get [it] right in our hospitals, in our clinics, in our coverage policies, and in our \ncommunities, people die.”  \n- Shamayne Braman, Director of Diversity and Inclusion at HealthPartners, 2018 \n“White people…have quite enough to do in learning how to accept and love themselves and \neach other, and when they have achieved this — which will not be tomorrow and may very \nwell be never — the Negro problem will no longer exist, for it will no longer be needed.”  \nJames Baldwin in The Fire Next Time, 1963 \nIntroduction \n Chapter 5 provides an interpretation of the findings from interviews with 16 \nhealthcare leaders and consultants regarding the effective engagement of White people in \nworkplace inclusion strategies. The first section of the chapter is an interpretation bounded \nby the concepts presented in Chapter 2, the Review of Literature. These bounded \ninterpretations include the sub-topics of response to the research, interpersonal strategies for \nWhite engagement, and organizational strategies for White engagement. The second section \npresents conclusions, which include a summary of interpretations - key insights for \npractitioners - and a personal reflection. \nInterpretation of Key Findings \n  This interpretation examines the key interview data in light of the concepts presented \nin Chapter 2, the Literature Review. I divide this section into four sub-sections: response to \nthe research topic regarding the focus on Whiteness, response to the research topic regarding \n128 \n \n \n \ndiversity approach, interpersonal issues of engaging White people in workplace inclusion, \nand organizational strategies for promoting engagement of White people in workplace \ninclusion. At the close of each section, I suggest implications for practitioners. \nResponse to the Research Topic and Whiteness \nBased on the research process and findings, there was significant support for the \nresearch topic among participants. I reached out to 23 people requesting a one-hour \ninterview, with no enticement other than the participants’ involvement with the research, and \nI received 17 affirmative responses, a 74% positive response rate. Sixteen of the 17 \neventually scheduled and attended the interview with me. If there was significant opposition \nto the research project or how I framed it, it would be hard to discern from the ease of the \nrecruitment process. Once the interviews were conducted, the findings showed that nine (9) \nneither expressed support nor objection for the research and four (4) of the participants \nexpressed support. Therefore, 13 of the 16 participants did not express an objection or \nconcern.  \nHowever, there were three participants who did express an objection or concern and \nthese responses provide critical insights into the dynamics of diversity approach and race. \nZari expressed that they were not “comfortable” with the title of the research specifying a \n‘White’ racial designation: “I think that certainly these days we think more about ancestry as \nopposed to White and Black. So ancestry would be I think a better term because certainly, \nthere's only one human race… “Overall, this sentiment connects to work by Stevens (2008), \nPlaut (2011), and Apfelbaum (2016) that showed the critical importance of language in \nworkplace inclusion.  \n129 \n \n \n \nFurther, Zari’s assertion that “these days we” do not use ‘White’ connotes a belief \nthat using racial language is a thing of the past, at least in the realm of workplace inclusion. \nLonnie’s assertion that my use of ‘White people’ in the research topic was “inflammatory” \nalso expresses this view. The idea that, in order to transcend racism, we need to remove \n‘White’ from communications stands in contrast to the view of Critical Race Theorists, \nWhiteness scholars, and observers such as Coates (2015), who argue that not discussing race \namounts to collusion with systemic racism (Frankenberg, 1993; Helms, 1995; Hooks, 1995). \nThat Whiteness should not be discussed by Whites and non-Whites alike is a central tenet of \ninstitutionalized Whiteness (McIntosh, 1988; Helms, 1990; Painter, 2011; Lipsitz, 2018). As \ndescribed in Chapter 2, ‘White’ communicates a social process and social position of an \nindividual relative to the current and historic economic, legal, and political domination of \nnon-White people, otherwise known as White Supremacy. This system of White domination \nwas intentionally developed and fostered by particular White people who stood to benefit \nfrom it (Painter, 2011; Coates, 2015). Indeed, the very existence of diversity, equity, and \ninclusion work in healthcare owes its existence, in part, to the gross, persistent health \ndisparities, and disparities in care received, between White and non-White individuals. \n(Lipsitz, 2018).  \nBut the concerns and objections expressed by three participants make a distinction \nbetween strategic work to address disparities wrought by racism and using the language of \nrace. Zari’s preferred ‘European American’ seeks to remove the Whiteness from those \nindividuals, who by accident of their skin color and other phenotype characteristics, are \nproffered with White privilege. Zari would likely agree with Lonnie when they argue that, in \n130 \n \n \n \norder to transcend race, workplace inclusion leaders should remove, or at least “mute” racial \ndesignation: \n… the whole point of the existence of diversity and inclusion initiatives is to mute, \nM-U-T-E, the significance of the self-assignment of race or ethnicity… As long as we \ncontinue to articulate race as a descriptor of those that are participating in \nimprovement and quite frankly those that are targeted, we continue to end up with \nsomewhat polarizing views…  \n Therefore, Zari nor Lonnie would not likely connect their concern with using the \nword ‘White’ with colluding with the system of White domination. However, their objection \ncan reasonably be associated with the contemporary societal preference for keeping \nWhiteness, and White Supremacy, hidden from view. To these participants, avoiding the \nWhite racial designation in language, if not in dealing with racism-related issues, amounts to \na practical choice to avoid inflaming racial tensions at the expense of their strategic goals. I \nimagine that, in a debate with Critical Race Theory scholars, these senior healthcare leaders \nmight argue,  \n“OK, we understand, probably as well as anyone, how removing or softening racial \ndesignations might work to reinforce old patterns of discrimination. But we are tasked \nwith an organizational project that strategically attacks sources of racial \ndiscrimination in the health system. In this context, what use is there to using ‘White’ \nor to calling attention to race if it will compromise the entire project? Further, if our \ninterest is in engaging White people with diversity and inclusion work, why would we \nuse a concept that is more likely to drive White people away than attract them?”  \n131 \n \n \n \nFor, the healthcare insiders might claim, as Lonnie writes in his follow up email to \nme, “In nearly every public discourse, once race enters the discussion, all progress stops and \nacrimony begins (March 4, 2019)”.  \nIn response, White privilege scholar DiAngelo might quote her work that \ndemonstrated how ignoring Whiteness “reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its \nproblems are what “they” have, not us [White people] through coded language (1988, p. \n55)”. Further, DiAngelo might argue, when trainers allow White privilege to ‘[remain] \nunnamed and explicitly denied’ in diversity education, this reinforces the very dynamics that \ncreate the need for such training (p. 64). \nResponse to Research Topic and Diversity Approach \nBesides the issue of racial language, the support for, and the three objections or \nconcerns with, the research topic speaks to a fundamental difference in diversity approach. \nHere I use Apfelbaum’s definition of diversity approach, which is ‘how diversity and social \ngroup differences are discussed’ in organizational and leadership communication (2016, p. \n547). Diversity approach can be seen as an extension of Plaut’s work on diversity models, \nwhich are an organizing principles that guide how diversity strategies are presented and \nmessaged (2011). Plaut’s work, in part conducted in a large healthcare context, compares the \nimpact of the approaches ‘colorblindness,’ ‘multiculturalism,’ and ‘all-inclusive \nmulticulturalism’ (AIM) on feelings of exclusion and likelihood of endorsing the diversity \nplatform (2011). Apfelbaum’s work uses a series of experiments wherein subjects are given \nchallenging work-like tasks after being exposed to the ‘value in equality’ and ‘value in \ndifference’ approaches to diversity (2016). Taken together, Apfelbaum’s and Plaut’s work \nsupports the idea that White employees, even when considering the overlay of gender, \n132 \n \n \n \ninterpret and process messaging about diversity differently from non-Whites. Further, these \nworks support the ideas that diversity approaches trigger feelings of exclusion or inclusion, \nresult in lower or higher endorsement of diversity and inclusion efforts, and negatively or \npositively affects performance of White employees. Apfelbaum’s work also supports the \nhypothesis that the organizational context of perceived ‘numerical inferiority’ is a mediating \ninfluence the impact of diversity approach. Plaut and Apfelbaum’s work implies that, in \norder to engage White employees in diversity and inclusion strategies, diversity approaches \nshould use language that is all-inclusive of racial and ethnic background, includes a ‘value in \ndifference’ approach (in addition to ‘value in equality’), and is calibrated to the \norganizational context, particularly in regards to ‘stereotype threat’ levels relating to \nnumerical representation of each group.   \nWhile the current study did not measure the effectiveness of various diversity \napproaches, the diversity approach construct is helpful in understanding the contrast between \nthe support and concerns or objections expressed by the participants regarding the topic of \nWhite engagement. Quinn’s concern with the primary research question, “I don’t think [the \nwork] is what White people do versus Asian people do or Black people do,” is exemplary of \na contrast in diversity approach as shown by Apfelbaum’s (2016) research. Apfelbaum shows \nhow a ‘value in difference’ approach is generally preferred by dominant group members (e.g. \nWhite men) because our representation concerns are low and the value in equality approach \nis preferred by non-dominant groups. I, a White man, developed a research topic that reflects \na value in difference approach in that it explicitly calls out the need to value and manage the \nengagement of employees with White racial identity. Lonnie and Quinn, both non-White \nsenior leaders in majority White organizations, signal that they prefer a value in equality \n133 \n \n \n \napproach. As Lonnie comments, their preference is that communications intended to promote \ninclusion stress the “greater good in having [diversity and inclusion] efforts, that is what \nappeals to everyone….No one is going to lose their identity being engaged in diversity and \ninclusion, but everyone will seek what constitutes real value.” \nTo Lonnie, “real value” is the business case for diversity and inclusion in healthcare. \nTo the extent that the business case is in conflict with the goal of racial justice, this connects \nto the work of Mease (2016) regarding the ongoing ‘discursive’ conflict between the goals of \n‘social justice,’ which include ending race-based oppression writ large, and goals of \norganizational performance. Thus, while advocates of the social justice case for workplace \ninclusion may prefer directly addressing Whiteness in order to reduce its pervasive, if \nunintentional, cultural impact, leaders such as Zari, Lonnie, and Quinn might prefer to \nassiduously avoid using racial language that implicitly link White employees to ongoing \nracial inequity in order to achieve, or at least not subvert, their strategic goals.  \nInterpersonal Aspects of White Engagement in Workplace Inclusion \n The interview responses regarding interpersonal aspects of White engagement dealt \nwith the exceptionality of White employees in relation to workplace inclusion, challenge or \nlack of challenge of White engagement, psychological safety, and positive development of \nidentity, relationship, and White allyship. Here I review each interpersonal issue in turn, \nconsidering how they relate to the ideas presented in the Literature Review.  \nExceptionality of White employees’ engagement in workplace inclusion. \nSave for three responses to the contrary, a majority of participants generally \nsupported the idea of White employees being exceptional in how they needed to be managed. \nThis exceptionality included opportunities such as Whites’ ability to “establish cultural \n134 \n \n \n \nnorms” and outsized “potential to really impact the organization,” “whether they know it or \nnot” (Emery and Deandre).  \n These interview results regarding the exceptionality of engaging White people in \nworkplace inclusion demonstrated numerous theoretical concepts from the Literature \nReview. Both the work of management-oriented scholars Plaut and Apfelbaum and the \nCritical Race Theory and Whiteness scholars such as Helms, DiAngelo, and Spanierman \nsupport the overall notion that employees with White racial identity, due to their position in \nthe dominant racial hierarchy, are exceptional in relationship to workplace inclusion \nstrategies.   \nChallenge or lack of challenge of White engagement. \nSeven participants also described White exceptionality in terms of particular \nchallenges to realizing the benefits of their outsized influence. Six participants mentioned \nWhite employees feeling, or acting as though they felt, excluded from workplace inclusion \nactivities. The reasons provided for exclusion were “the diversity conversation was aimed at \nWhite people [in a negative way],” exclusionary language such as using “diverse” to mean \nnon-White, and a lack of connection between workplace inclusion efforts and Whites’ \n“vested self-interest” (Robin, Emery, and Oakley). Participants mentioned the challenges of \n“having to be gentle” with Whites (Finley), Whites taking the existence of racism as a \npersonal attack (Emery) and White disbelief in their societal advantage, regardless of gender \nor class status (Emery, Dionne and Finley). Not insignificantly, numerous participants \nnoticed that these challenges were heightened by the current political and social “climate” \nsince the 2016 presidential election. In contrast to other participants’ experience of \n135 \n \n \n \nchallenges, Lonnie “was pleased to report” and “delighted” that White engagement in \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion work was strong in diversity-related programs and activities. \nThe findings in regards to challenge or lack of challenge to engaging Whites in \nworkplace inclusion correspond to numerous theories described in Chapter 2. Whites’ \nperception of exclusion from inclusion strategies corroborates Plaut (2011)’s finding that \nWhite employees in a large healthcare organization were significantly more likely to \nassociate the legacy conception of multiculturalism with exclusion. This finding was directly \ncorroborated by numerous independent studies (Shelton, 2013; Witt/Keifer, 2017) and work \nby Aysola (2018) in her narrative study of workplace inclusion in an academic medical \ncenter: some Whites reported feeling excluded from diversity and inclusion efforts.27   \nMcIntosh’s work on White privilege and DiAngelo’s work on White fragility (see \nalso Sue 2010) connects with numerous challenges mentioned by participants of the current \nstudy, principally Whites disbelieving societal advantage and having heightened sensitivity \nto race-related topics. To these scholars, the White beliefs and behaviors that challenge \nworkplace inclusion mentioned by participants follow from an interpersonal agenda, however \nunconsciously it is carried out, of avoiding personal responsibility for engaging in new \nbehaviors that expose racial inequity, reduce White privilege, and support people of color’s \nleadership. Helms (1990) model of positive White identity also provides a useful perspective \non the challenges of White engagement as fundamentally developmental behaviors, \n                                                 \n27 In the White Men’s Leading Through Diversity & Inclusion (WMLTDI) Study, a cross-industry study of 670 \ncorporate leaders from 2012, 70% of White men and 60% of women and non-Whites were ‘not clear’ if \ndiversity and inclusion work were intended for White men (Shelton 2013). The consulting firm Diversity Best \nPractices explained this phenomenon as ‘an unintended outcome of framing D&I’ as targeted to historically \ndisadvantaged groups ‘is that the dominant employee group, white males, are often left out of the equation and \ntherefore significantly less engaged in D&I efforts than their underrepresented colleagues’ (2013, p1). \n \n136 \n \n \n \nsomething like the path to adulthood. The Helms model attributes these challenges to the \nemotionally rocky journey from ignorance of Whiteness through cognitive dissonance \nultimately to a non-racist White identity. For example, when Zari and Dionne reported that \nsome White workshop attendees denied the existence of white privilege, Helms would locate \nthis behavior in the early ‘disintegration’ phase, when Whites are prone to ‘selectively attend \nto only the information that gives him or her greater confidence’ (1990, p. 59). Since Lonnie \ndid not report these challenging behaviors, Whiteness scholars might surmise that Lonnie has \nfound a strategic formula to counter the vagaries of White privilege in the workplace \ninclusion arena. Or, as pertaining to the Helms model, perhaps there is a critical mass of \nWhite colleagues of Lonnie who have progressed to the ‘immersion’ or ‘autonomy’ phases of \npositive White identity development. \nSchein’s (2016) work on culture change also provides insight into the participant \nresponses regarding the challenges of engaging Whites in healthcare inclusion strategies. The \nbehaviors that Schein cites, such as denial, avoidance, and open resistance, can be seen as \ntypically human responses to numerous fears that are triggered by any major change project, \nlet alone one dealing with issues of diversity and inclusion. In Table 16 below, in an \nenhancement of Table 5 from the Literature Review, I list the fears sparked by learning from \nSchein (2016) with examples from diversity and inclusion work in a healthcare workplace \nsetting. While participants may not have mentioned these fears verbatim, numerous \nparticipants, including Lonnie, Robin, Emery, and Francis address the overall issue of fear as \na driver of challenging behavior.    \n  \n137 \n \n \n \nTable 16: Schein’s (2016) list of fears associated with learning anxiety during organizational \nchange, with examples from healthcare diversity and inclusion (D&I) work \nFear Description Example from D&I work \nFear of loss of power or \nposition \nNew learning may mean loss \nof status or power \nDivision chief learning a new \ninterviewing process that is more \nbias-proof means she can hire \nfewer acquaintances within her \nsocial circle, meaning that her \npersonal influence is diminished \nFear of temporary \nincompetence \nGiving up old ways of doing \nthings means giving up \nexpertise; we know we will \nhave to do things that we have \nnot mastered yet  \nChief Medical Officer is afraid of \nappearing incompetent as he \nlearns to not interrupt women \ncolleagues during senior \nleadership meetings    \nFear of punishment for \nincompetence  \nIf learning period results in \nmistakes or too long a duration, \nwe fear productivity may be \nharmed, resulting in reprisal by \nmanagement \nEmergency department IT \nManager fears that they will be \nsanctioned by management for \nslower response times due to \nincorporating a new, more \ninclusive structure for team \nmeetings \nFear of loss of personal \nidentity \nIf new learning requires us to \ntake on a new way of being, we \nmay not want be ‘that kind of \nperson’ \nVice Chair of Curriculum for \nmedical school sees that \ndevelopment of a new, more \ninclusive curriculum requires a \ndeep appreciation for social issues \nthat find politically unpalatable \nFear of loss of group \nmembership \nIf new learning challenges \nshared assumptions of their \ngroup culture, changing those \nassumptions also may result in, \nor  appear to result in, \nseparation from the group \nMedical technicians learning to \nspeak up as active bystanders for \nelder patients fear that this will \nchange how they are viewed by \nother technicians, who value \n‘keeping their head down’ and \n‘focusing on the task at hand’ \n \n \n138 \n \n \n \nPsychological safety. \nTo mitigate the potential interpersonal challenges of White engagement, numerous \n(7) participants describe the importance of establishing psychological safety in workplace \ninclusion strategies and interventions. These spaces were to be free of “blame, shame, or \nguilt,” avoid sending the message that “White people are the enemy,” enabling employees to \n“be vulnerable” (Sydney, Francis, and Finley).  \nThe theme of psychological safety in the interviews is addressed directly in chapter 2 \nas a key orienting theory for understanding White engagement in workplace inclusion.28 Per \nEdmondson (2002) and Hackman and Lorsch (1987), creating psychological safety is \nparticularly important for developing trusting relationships and learning new skills, two \nessential competencies associated with increasing a more inclusive workplace. In their \nresponses, the participants also demonstrated understanding of the dark side of psychological \nsafety in the workplace. That is, when fear is dominant, this sparks behaviors such as \ndisengagement and resistance intended to shield employees from danger, both real and \nemotional (Kidder et al, 2004; Dollard and Bakker, 2010; Ross, 2018).  As described above, \nSchein also discusses management of psychological safety at length in his recommendations \nfor leading culture changes.  \nPositive development of identity, relationship, and White allyship. \nParticipant comments regarding White employees developing a positive identity, \npositive relationships, and effective interpersonal strategies for being an ally to workplace \ninclusion. To help employees reach these positive states, the senior leaders and consultants \ngiving Whites a “bridge” or “[meeting] them where they are” to develop their own \n                                                 \n28 The 2012 WMLTDI Study calls out psychological safety as the number 1 finding: ‘There are safety \nconcerns’ (Shelton, 2013, p. 6).  \n139 \n \n \n \n“appreciation and understanding” of inclusion issues and their relationship to them (Emery \nand Zari). Participants reported facilitating White employees or students to build “a set of \ncompetencies” for leading across boundaries and “bring [their] talents together” and “join \nforces” in service of “something beyond [themselves]” (Sydney, Emery, Lane, and Quinn). \nFor those White employees seeking to move beyond the base level of involvement with \nworkplace inclusion, participants described the desired behaviors of champions or allies. \nThese ally behaviors ranged from “curiosity” and “[positive] body language” to “being \nwilling to understand the life experience [of people of color] and “eliminating \ncolorblindness” from their view of race and ethnicity (Lane, Finley, Zari, Dionne, Robin). \nParticipants observed ally behavior when White leaders would “bring up these issues without \na diversity officer in the room” (Jamie, Deandre, Oakley), showing vulnerability by telling \npersonal stories of inclusion (Marques, Lane, Sydney), and embracing the notion that “if we \ndo our job [as healthcare providers] wisely, effectively, [then] we need to embrace everyone” \n(Lonnie). Finally, Zari and Robin stressed that ally-like behaviors were part and parcel of \nWhite leaders actively embracing, respectively, a value system and ontology that supports \ngreater inclusion in the workplace.  \nWhether participants focused on deeper psychological alignment or outward \nbehaviors, their responses demonstrate numerous aspects of the scholarly work on positive \nidentity development outlined in the Literature Review. As described by Dutton (2010), \nWrzesniewski and Dutton (2001) and colleagues, an essential aspect of inclusive cultures is \nthat they enable employees to achieve positive attributes such as goodness and worthiness. \nParticipants 3’s and 4’s descriptions of allowing White employees, wherever “they are at”, to \nengage authentically with the work is a good example of enabling positive identity \n140 \n \n \n \ndevelopment. Just as scholars theorize that positive identities enable the development of \npositive relationships, Lane, Deandre, and Lonnie all discuss how their inclusion strategies \nprovide employees to build relationships across difference based upon achieving the higher \ngoals of health equity and community engagement. Critically, as Ely and Roberts (2008) \nshow, these project-based learning opportunities encourage transcendence of stereotypes \nwhile delivering lessons to participants in ‘simultaneity’ (intersectionality of social \nidentities), intra-group relations, and diversity as an asset (p.176). Or, as Stevens and Plaut \n(2008) put it, positive relationships allow workers to ‘move beyond surface-level tactics to \nactively incorporate diversity into their work lives’ (p. 124). Given the alignment between \npositive identity development and inclusive behaviors, it is worth considering whether \ninterventions that focus on the identification of difference, privilege and power are \ncompatible with the positive organization model. The PRCE at Henry Ford Health System as \ndescribed in Chapter 2 would be one such intervention (Holm et al, 2017). \nIn the realm of engaging White employees in workforce inclusion, the development \nof positive identities and relationships can be seen as synonymous with development a White \nally identity. Helms’ (1995) non-racist White identity model provides a foundational \nperspective on White allyship as a developmental process. Within Helms’ framework, the \ninstances of defensiveness and sensitivity mentioned by participants and cited by McIntosh \n(1988) and DiAngelo (2011) can be viewed not as permanent conditions of Whiteness but as \nearly stages in a well-understood psychological process: the breaking down old identities and \ncognitive-behavioral patterns and the building up of new ones.  \nWhite allyship, as in definitions by Tatum (2007) and Spanierman (2017), is an \naspirational construct that involves a White individual who transcends racism by \n141 \n \n \n \n‘understanding that it is possible to use one’s privilege to create more equitable systems,’ \ncontinually self-reflects on their own position vis-a-vis racism, and engages in actions that \ndisrupt racism and support the leadership of people of color (Spanierman and Smith, 2017, p. \n608 - 609). In their citations of behavior such as sponsoring leadership of people of color \n(Deandre), speaking up for workplace inclusion in the absence of a diversity and inclusion \nleader (Oakley), and actively reaching out to hear and incorporate the perspective of people \nof color (Harper), the interviewees provided some evidence of ally-like behaviors at their \ninstitutions.  \nOrganizational Strategies for Engagement of White People in Workplace Inclusion \nIn addition to the interpersonal aspects of the research topic, the interviewees provide \nvaluable insights into organizational strategies that they believe promote workplace \ninclusion, including the engagement of White employees in the work. In Chapter 4 - \nFindings, I divided the organizational strategies into two categories - strategic frame and \nleadership activities. Here I explore the implications of each by reviewing the categories in \nturn and how they relate to the ideas presented in Chapter 2, Literature Review.  \nBeyond diversity approach: strategic frame. \nThe participants’ strategic frame for promoting workplace inclusion was influential in \nhow they approached the question of effective engagement of White employees. I define \nstrategic frame as the central argument for pursuing greater inclusion in the workplace. The \ninterviewees revealed their frames either explicitly by directly addressing the issue or \nimplicitly through their choices of words and subjects. I divide the participants’ comments \ninto three major strategic frames: the healthcare quality case, the business case, and the social \njustice case. In practical usage, the frames overlap and participants use numerous frames. \n142 \n \n \n \nAdditionally, several participants clarified that their approach was meant to “speak to all \ngroups” (Francis) rather than just White colleagues.  \n When thinking about effective engagement of Whites in workplace inclusion, \nparticipants discussed two dimensions healthcare quality: one, in terms of promoting health \nequity and lessening disparities and two, in terms of professional medical training to ensure \nequitable care. Regarding overall health equity, at least eight participants explicitly used this \nmission-driven argument to appeal to White employees. Participants mentioned “gross” \nhealth disparities such as “Black patients get referred for cardiac testing at rates [far less] \nfrequently [than] Whites” (Francis) and “black women’s mortality rates in… [childbirth] at \nfour times that of White women” (Dionne). Others, particularly Zari and Lane, focused their \ncomments on embedding the inclusion agenda into clinical training to promote healthcare \nquality. Despite the clear necessity to communicate the healthcare quality case, at least two \nparticipants professed an overall allegiance to the business case for engaging Whites, and \nparticularly White senior leaders, in the inclusion agenda. Lonnie summed up this sentiment: \n“One part of that greater good [of diversity and inclusion work] is the importance of health \nequity for all. Hard to argue with that. But an even more compelling, more pragmatic greater \ngood is [that] the business model must continue to be changed.” While the business case and \nhealthcare case appeal to organizational and professional priorities, participants’ adherence to \nthe social justice case was apparent in their choice of words and subject matter. Examples \ninclude, “there’s certain people as groups that have suffered more than others (Robin)” and \n“a system that’s been in place for hundreds of years… with implicit rules (Dionne)”.  \n This debate over how to strategically frame workplace inclusion to engage White \npeople was given scant attention in the Literature Review. However, Mease’s (2016) work on \n143 \n \n \n \nthe ‘discursive conflict’ for diversity consultants is directly applicable. Mease identifies the \ndivergent goals of social justice, which include ending race-based oppression, and the goals \nof organizational performance, which are financial and operational - defined within the walls \nof the institution. These divergent goals are evident in the participant responses regarding the \neffective engagement of White employees. On one hand, the more social-justice oriented \nparticipants may prefer, or even insist, upon directly addressing Whiteness in order to reduce \nits largely hidden but pervasive impact on organizational cultures. On the other hand, the \nparticipants favoring the business and healthcare quality cases expressed a preference for \naddressing racial politics obliquely. While Mease does not propose a specific answer to this \n‘conflict’, her recommendation for effective management of it involves identifying common \ngoals and ‘both - and’ strategies that fulfill social justice and organizational priorities.  \nPlaut and Apfelbaum’s work on diversity models and diversity approaches is adjacent \nto the debate around strategic frames. While Plaut and Apfelbaum’s work dealt with “how \ndiversity and social group differences are discussed” (Apfelbaum, 2016, 547), the three \nstrategic frames explicated by participants operate at a more strategic level. Plaut and \nApfelbaum’s audience is primarily designers of communication strategy for diversity and \ninclusion whereas the participants’ strategic frames address a C-suite audience. Plaut and \nApfelbaum dealt with the “how” of diversity approach while many of the senior healthcare \nand consulting leaders were focused on the “why” of workplace inclusion. Nevertheless, both \nlevels of inquiry apply to the project of engaging White people in that they represent choices \nthat workplace inclusion leaders must make regarding explanation of both the “why” and the \n“how” of their work to various audiences.  \n144 \n \n \n \nLeadership activities as leading organizational change.  \n The interviews of 16 organizational leaders and consultants resulted in rich data \nregarding effective leadership activities in the management of workplace inclusion. My \nquestions regarding engaging White individuals elicited responses that referred to engaging \nWhite leaders or White employees, whatever their level or function. Participants also \ndiscussed their own leadership activities. Chief among these activities was embedding \nworkplace inclusion into the larger strategy of the organization and matching the strategic \ncommitment with financial backing. These activities signal evidence that a leader is aligned \nwith the values and overall perspective of the diversity and inclusion functional leader. \nAligning values is just a starting point for creating a shared vision that resonates with the key \nstakeholders, particularly White leaders who may not fully grasp their vested interest in \ndiversity and inclusion strategies.  Participants stressed the importance of pushing action \ndown through the organization by encouraging their teams to align. There were numerous \nparticipant citations of the beneficial effects of senior leaders tying diversity objectives to \nperformance and to financial outcomes, as well as writing inclusion-friendly policies and \nprocedures. Beyond these operational activities, numerous participants mentioned the use of \nrelationship-building as critical for winning White engagement. This relationship-building \ncould be partnering with colleagues, sponsoring the leadership of people of color, or actively \nrecruiting the perspectives of White middle-managers on the diversity leadership committee. \nParticipants saw effective White leaders use these relationships to establish accountability \npush back on resistance. The leaders’ relationships enabled another key activity in the \nworkplace inclusion project: strategic communications. Participants commented on the need \n145 \n \n \n \nto tailor specific messages for organizational groups, including those with White majorities \nand avoiding language that may be exclusionary.  \n When considered as a whole, the findings on leadership activities support the overall \ncontention that promoting workplace inclusion in healthcare cannot be confined to a \nparticular functional area. Rather, creating a more inclusive workplace is an organizational \nchange project involving both cultural and technical aspects, of which engaging White \nleaders and employees is one part. Therefore, as described in the Literature Review, the \nchange management model of Hiatt and Creasey (2012) and the work of Schein (2016) on \nculture change are apt for better understanding the leadership activities of workplace \ninclusion.  \nAs described in the review of literature, change management experts Hiatt and \nCreasey (2012) lead research and training at ProSCI, an independent, science-driven \norganization dedicated to the practice of change management. The last six ProSCI \nlongitudinal studies on the best practices in change management (2018, 2016, 2014, 2012, \n2010, 2008), have found that the existence of a highly engaged executive sponsors is the \nnumber one predictor of successful organizational change (Creasey and Hiatt, 2019). In the \ninterviews, there were numerous mentions that relate to executive sponsorship in the current \nstudy. Sydney’s comments about their CEO are exemplary:  \n[they] really set the tone and it is communicated and pushed down. So [they] are \nholding [their] executive teams accountable for creating diverse and inclusive \nworkspaces. That's being done through our internal policies and procedures, so that's \nkind of the system change that [they have] influence over… So since [they have] been \n146 \n \n \n \nin [their] role, we've seen a 71% increase in minority executives. They’re doing the \nsame thing with the board, which is kind of a tricky dance. \nParticipants also discussed roles of executive sponsors that mirror Hiatt and Creasey’s \n(2012) guidance that sponsors must authorize the change, build coalitions to rally support and \nmitigate resistance to the change, and communicate directly about the change (p. 12). \nExamples included senior leaders “embedding” or “mainstreaming” workplace inclusion into \nthe larger strategy of the organization (Francis; Zari) and matching the strategic commitment \nwith “dollars” and “financial sponsorship” (Oakley; Lonnie). Robin, echoing Hiatt and \nCreasey, argue that change leaders can directly impact employees’ awareness of the need to \nchange by communicating “the vision of the [more inclusive] organization that we want to \ncreate…. And I mean in detail.” Harper and Quinn underline the benefits of building \nrelationships throughout the organization, which echoes the ProSCI recommendation that \neffective executive sponsors must build coalitions. In the case of creating a more inclusive \nworkplace, building coalitions across boundaries of positional power, function, and social \nidentity are key. Participants reported strong leaders as using these relationships to establish \n“accountability” (Sydney) and even “push back on resistance in a way that people of color \nmay not” (Deandre).  \nBeyond sponsorship, another critical part of the ProSCI change management \nplaybook is strategic communication and understanding the dynamics of “senders and \nreceivers” (Hiatt and Creasey, 2012). Numerous participants reported striving to connect \nwith audiences, the receivers of information) with divergent goals, places in the hierarchy, \nand professional training. Deandre discusses their efforts to understand their receivers: “my \nmessage tends to be different with provider groups versus our medical assistant groups… [I \n147 \n \n \n \nwant] the messaging and packaging… to be able to speak to what’s important to them.” At \nleast four others mention the importance of leaders to master art of finding the WIIFM \n(‘what’s in it for me?’) of different audiences. Just as the participants described the \nimportance of knowing their various audiences, including White employees, and tailoring \nmessages to suit them, so too do Hiatt and Creasey recommend knowing the WIIFM of all \nmajor functions involved in a change. In the case of messaging for majority White groups, \nthis might include knowing how, as Emery says, those with White racial identity can grasp \ntheir “vested self-interest” in creating a more inclusive workplace.  \nSchein’s work on leadership of organizational culture change also provides a helpful \nlens for viewing the participants’ comments regarding leadership activities for promoting \nworkplace inclusion. In his recommendations for change leaders, Schein’s (2016, pps. 328 - \n385) cites numerous activities that were directly mentioned by participants during the \ninterviews:  \n● Providing a compelling vision for the change (Robin) \n● Providing formal training around activities associated with the change (Oakley) \n● Involve the learner in managing their own informal learning (Lane) \n● Train relevant “family” groups and teams (Deandre) \n● Removing barriers and building new support systems and structures (Francis) \n● Redefining concepts to help new beliefs and values take hold (Quinn) \n● The change goal being defined concretely (Lonnie) \n● Developing new standards of evaluation (Jamie) \nThese include steps associated with creating both psychological safety and \norganizational mechanisms to shepherd the organization through culture change. Participants \n148 \n \n \n \nalso reported their appreciation of leaders modelling the changes desired in the workplace \ninclusion culture (Sydney, Harper). In sum, Schein’s approach to leading culture change \nlends support to the findings regarding leadership activities that promote workplace inclusion \nin general and engagement of White employees in specific. \nConclusions \n In this capstone paper, I have explored the topic of effective engagement of White \nemployees in healthcare workplace inclusion from multiple perspectives. In some ways, my \nuse of an interdisciplinary approach reflects the core learning goal of the Organizational \nDynamics program at the University of Pennsylvania. In my January 2016 foundations class, \nProfessor Janet Greco demonstrated this perspective-taking ability by taking out a Ziploc bag \nof eyeglasses – some big, some small, some tinted brown, some green, some clear. In turn, \nDr. Greco put each pair of glasses on to demonstrating how the various ‘lenses’ on \norganizational life change one’s view of reality. Her lesson was that Organizational \nDynamics practitioners needed to understand and be facile with numerous conceptual lenses \nin order to help leaders arrive at better conclusions, get unstuck, innovate, and grow. In this \nstudy, I also used many lenses. There was the personal (researcher) lens, the healthcare lens, \nthe historic lens, the academic lens, and the practitioner lens. I examined the interpersonal \nand organizational perspectives. I probed the subject in terms of the value of appreciating \ndifference and that of uniting behind common goals. There were many more perspectives – \ntoo many to name! \nHowever important the value of this exploration, the reader may be wondering what \nto do with all these perspectives. Therefore, the final question that I will answer is, “So \nwhat?” While my answer will not be a prescription to the reader, I will offer a few \n149 \n \n \n \nsuggestions. In conclusion to this chapter and to the capstone project, I have summarized the \nimplications of the results and synthesized them to produce four key insights for \npractitioners. Following that, I provide a narrative description of a personal realization \nregarding the limits of good intentions in creating a diverse and inclusive research project.    \nSummary of Implications: Key Insights for Practitioners \nIn this study of effective engagement of White employees in healthcare inclusion \nstrategies, I conducted a review of academic literature, interviewed 16 practitioners \nassembled and analyzed the results, and interpreted the results through the lenses of the \nreviewed literature. The interpretation of findings have resulted in four key insights for \npractitioners. Each insight is followed by suggested actions for practitioners. Also in this \nsection, I cite non-academic but reputable sources of knowledge regarding engaging Whites \nin diversity and inclusion work.29 \nInsight #1. \nWhile the subjects of racism, Whiteness, and White Supremacy are highly relevant to \nthe project of workplace inclusion in healthcare, there is disagreement among practitioners \non whether, and how, to discuss these issues directly. These disagreements somewhat \ncorrespond to differences in participants’ ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ status and racial identity.  \nSome participants, especially high-level, established leaders in academic medical \ncenters with non-White racial identities, see far more costs than benefits to directly \naddressing these issues. Other participants, particularly either consultants or mid-upper tier \nleaders with White and non-White identities, were either neutral or saw more benefits than \ncosts to directly addressing racism, Whiteness, and White Supremacy. However, the \n                                                 \n29 For non-academic studies of engagement of White people in workforce inclusion, see Shelton (2013), \nDiversity Best Practices (2013), Witt/Keifer (2015), and White Men as Full Diversity Partners (2018). \n150 \n \n \n \nmediating influences of insider and outsider status and racial identity on participant views \nwere not consistent. \nTherefore, my suggestion is that both ‘insiders’ (practitioners employed at healthcare \norganizations) and ‘outsiders’ (consultants) of both White and non-White racial identities \ncontinue the dialogue regarding the best ways to approach these issues with the goal of \nestablishing common ground and common practices. Next steps may be \n● conducting a national quantitative survey of both insiders and outsiders on their \napproaches to racism, Whiteness, and White Supremacy \n● facilitating both intra-group and inter-group dialogue on this topic at industry and \nacademic conferences  \nInsight #2. \nThe optimal mode of diversity approach (how diversity is discussed) for Whites and \nnon-Whites varies based on a complex combination of factors, particularly the various \ngroups’ perceived ‘stereotype threat’ based upon numerical representation in the \norganization and their intersectional identities relative to the White male power structure.  \nAs many participants reported, either explicitly or implicitly, their communication \nstrategies must, at least most of the time, speak to employees with one voice. However, the \nresearch on diversity approach shows that word choice and frequency matter in how Whites \nand non-Whites respond. But these preferences are not entirely reliable and shift based upon \neach group’s dynamic perceptions of relative power and influence. The dynamic nature of \nperceptions of power are particularly important given the United States’ epic demographic \nshift from a White majority to a non-White majority. \nTherefore, I suggest that participants: \n151 \n \n \n \n● Assess the relative numerical representation of each major social identity \ngroup at their organization and sub-units; survey the groups to clarify their \nlevels of ‘representation-based concerns,’ otherwise known as ‘stereotype \nthreat.’ \n● Generally, use a ‘both-and’ approach to messaging - incorporating both a \n‘value in equality’ message and a ‘value in difference’ message. Below are \ndefinitions of each. \n○ Value in Equality: ‘A value in equality approach affirms that group \nmembership will not be an obstacle to career opportunities and \nadvancement, and that all employees are judged equally and fairly \nbased on their skills, qualifications, and effort’ (Apfelbaum 2016, p. \n2). \n○ Value in Difference: ‘A value in difference approach advocates for the \nimportance of creating a workplace environment that appreciates (and \nis inclusive of) social group differences’ (Apfelbaum 2016, p. 2). \nInsight #3. \nBecause there are particular patterns of beliefs, emotions, and behavior associated \nwith the White encounter with inclusion initiatives, and given this group’s current outsized \ninfluence in the healthcare workplace, gaining a better understanding of how to support \npositive, non-racist White identity development would be a worthy investment of resources. \nThis insight is derived from what participants discussed and what they did not \ndiscuss. While several participants did discuss an awareness of supporting White \nengagement, many did not. While some expressed an understanding of the particular psycho-\n152 \n \n \n \nsocial challenges involved with the White encounter with workplace inclusion, many did not. \nOf those that did understand the challenges, very few participants conceived of the \nchallenges as stages in a developmental process for Whites grappling with their social \nidentity. While some expressed an awareness of the developmental process, most \nparticipants’ comments did not reflect a sophisticated understanding of non-racist White \nidentity development or allyship. Participants did report deployment of effective strategies \nfor inter-group engagement in mission-driven practicum projects in health equity and \ncommunity health. However, they did not report providing White employees with an intra-\ngroup opportunities to develop non-racist identities and build positive relationships.  \nTherefore, my suggestion is that practitioners partner with experts on White ally \ndevelopment to better understand the issues and promising strategies for fostering positive, \nnon-racist White identity in a workplace setting. These strategies may include \n● Working with senior leaders to infuse a positive identity development model into all \nleadership development activities \n● Working with senior leaders to embed best practices for positive identity \ndevelopment into middle managers’ training \n● Provide opportunities for inter-group relationship building through  \n○ mission-driven activities that brings together White and non-White groups \n○ facilitated workshops providing opportunities to appreciate both commonality \nand difference (see Creary, 2019) \n● Provide opportunities for intra-group relationship building for White employees, \nincluding  \n○ White ally groups can be organized internally or externally \n153 \n \n \n \n○ Education about a developmental model for becoming an effective ally; use \npositive role models, make available numerous, concrete examples of \neffective White ally behavior, and present the likely challenges along the way, \nboth personally and interpersonally.  \n○ Provide ‘practice fields’ and coaching by expert facilitators30 \nInsight #4.  \nFraming workplace inclusion work as an organizational culture change project has \nstrong potential to assist practitioners in creating a winning strategy, and in effectively \nengaging White leaders and employees as a part of that strategy. In particular, this frame \ncould be helpful for inclusion leaders seeking to help White employees feel included the \nwork. \nThis insight is derived from the many connections between the participants’ \ndescriptions of their work and well-established models of organizational culture change. \nSome participants appeared to make this connection to culture change, grasp its significance, \nand understand its implications. The concept of organizational culture change provides clear \ndirection to leaders’ management of interpersonal dynamics, such as psychological safety, \nand organizational dynamics, such as executive sponsorship. Additionally, thinking of \nworkplace inclusion as culture change captures the inherent difficulties and dangers of \nintentionally seeking to alter the shared assumptions of various work subcultures. White \nemployees represent one such subculture and, whether it is visible to them or not, their \nshared assumptions align with the dominant work culture at most healthcare organizations. \n                                                 \n30 The consulting firm White Men as Full Diversity Partners (2018) (WMFDP) provides one model for holistic \nleadership development for White men’s engagement in diversity and inclusion. They focus on leadership \ndevelopment through coaching and intra-group dialogue.  \n154 \n \n \n \nThis means that any significant culture change in healthcare organizations will involve \nchanging, at least in part, assumptions and norms of a White work culture. \nTherefore, my suggestion is that practitioners view their work overall, and the project \nof engaging White leaders and employees specifically, as organizational culture change. The \nfollowing suggestions are based upon best practices for culture change, as mentioned by \nparticipants and from the literature:  \n● Partner with colleagues and consultants to create an organizational change plan that \nseeks to effectively manage psychological safety for all stakeholder groups \n● Educate, train, and manage the executive sponsor as the most important aspect of the \nworkplace inclusion strategy  \n○ Given its importance, the executive sponsor is ideally the CEO of the \norganization. In 2016, Cardinal Health named its Chairman and CEO, a White \nman, to lead its diversity council (Diversity Best Practices, 2017) \n○ Besides simply authorizing and allocating resources to the change, the \nexecutive sponsor must \n■ Actively and visibly be involved in the change campaign from \nbeginning to end \n■ Build powerful coalitions of the willing and help manage resistance \n■ Communicate directly to employees about change; specifically the \nbusiness case \n○ Utilize external consultants with specific expertise. One model is White Men \nas Full Diversity Partners’ (WMFDP) ‘Pathways to Full Inclusion’ (see Figure \n155 \n \n \n \n5 below), which focuses on developing executive sponsorship in order to \nimpact the culture of inclusivity: \nFigure 5: WMFDP’s ‘Pathways to Full Inclusion’ process (2018) \n \n● Develop a sophisticated and detailed strategic communications plan that includes \n○ Do not discuss workforce inclusion as culture change; instead, focus on the \nconcrete behaviors that will be indicative that the change has been successful \n○ Using language and a strategic frame (i.e. business case, healthcare case, \nsocial justice case) that will inspire and align change agents across the \norganization31 \n○ A detailed vision for the more inclusive organization and how this connects to \nthe strategic frame mentioned above \n                                                 \n31 The WMLTDI study’s recommendation is to ‘hone the business case and career advantage every day’ \n(Shelton, 2013, p. 14) \n156 \n \n \n \n○ Understanding each audience’s WIIFM, including White leaders and \nmanagers \n■  Answer the most pressing concerns of many Whites about these \nissues, including this short list from the consulting firm Diversity Best \nPractices (2017, p. 6):  \n● I want to be involved, but I’m not sure how to get involved \n● I am fearful of repercussions: what if I say something wrong? \n● Diversity is a zero-sum game, what’s in it for me? \n● Why do I need to be engaged? \n■ Enlist their support by showing how increased diversity & inclusion \nsatisfies their self-interest (White Men as Full Diversity Partners, \n2018)  \n○ Support the executive sponsor to communicate the business case for the \nchange and the possible impacts of not changing. \n○ Support middle managers to develop messages that speak to personal impacts \nrather than business impact \n● Provide objective data and feedback about competencies associated with inclusion.32  \n● Use of existing models of engagement such as Deloitte’s six personas of strategic \nchange (see Figure 6) \n \n                                                 \n32 The WMLTDI study showed a significant gap between the self-assessed rating of White men leaders’ \ndiversity and inclusion skills and how others rated their skills. For example, White men rated themselves 45% \npositive effectiveness and others rated them as 21% positive (Shelton, 2013). \n157 \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Deloitte’s six personas of strategic change as applied to diversity and inclusion \n(Bourke and Dillon, 2018) \n \n \n \nA Personal Reflection \nI felt deeply invested in this capstone research project. Because of my deep personal \ninvestment in issues of race and organizational dynamics, the process itself triggered many \ninteresting thoughts. Many of these moments of reflection were concerning how I, as a White \nman, as an activist, and as a scholar-practitioner was going about executing a project that hit \nso close to home. Below I describe one such reflection in which I find out the limits of \nawareness and good intentions in pursuit of greater diversity and inclusion.  \nIn early March, I met with my advisor Harvey Floyd to discuss the struggles I had \nbeen having with the literature review. During our discussion, I was pleased to tell Harvey \nthat I had successfully recruited a diverse cohort by race and gender that generally reflected \nthe diversity of healthcare diversity and inclusion leaders. This felt like a repeat performance \nof the success I’d had in recruiting a diverse, excellent capstone team: my advisor was a fast-\nrising, mid-career, African American male coach and diversity consultant, and my reader was \nan advanced coaching practitioner, newly minted PhD, White female professor. But in the \n158 \n \n \n \ncourse of my discussion with Harvey about the myriad ways I believed my Whiteness \nimpacted the research, I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. I realized that, while my 16-\nperson cohort reflected the diversity of the ‘D&I’ function in healthcare, my first three \ninterviewees were all White. This realization caused my mind to swirl with questions:  \nHow did this happen? In my recruitment process, did I reach out to more White \npeople in the beginning? Or was it because two of the three White people at the \nbeginning were consultants, a professional status I myself coveted? Did I reach out in \na more energetic way, with more touchpoints, or more frequency? If yes, then why \nwas I more excited about interviewing White people? Or, if my recruitment was \ncarried out in a racially equitable way, was it the response that I received from the \nprospective interviewees of White and non-White identities that determined the order \nof the participants? And, if it was the response that I received, then was it about me \nbeing White, was it about a topic that centered Whiteness, or a combination of the \ntwo? If I had been a person of color doing this research, would I have gotten a quicker \nresponse from people of color (Kenneth R. Rosso, personal reflection, circa March 7, \n2019)?  \nAnd these questions sparked an even deeper thought: If I were a person of color, \nwould I have taken on a research topic framed around the White experience of workplace \ninclusion at all? I had no firm answers to these questions. What I did know, however, is that I \ncould not undo the past and replace any of those first three White participants with a person \nof color. What I could do was commit to changing my data analysis process and reporting to \nmitigate the potential impact on my research. When analyzing and presenting the findings, I \nmade sure to vary the starting point from which I reviewed the data, participant-by-\n159 \n \n \n \nparticipant. For, if I went from the ‘top’, or first interviews, each time, this would mean that \nthe first three responses to each of 10 questions would come from a White participant. \nInstead, I varied my starting place - from the ‘bottom,’ the ‘middle,’ and the ‘top.’ Then, in \nChapter 4, I committed to intentionally varying my choices of quotes between non-White and \nWhite participants. Lastly, I committed to revealing my process of self-discovery in the \ninterpretation of my findings.  \nWith these decisions behind me, I continued interviewing and reading. Still, by mid-\nMarch, my struggles with the Literature Review were beginning to become an open \nemotional sore that impacted the rest of my life. I became more moody and made poor \ndecisions at my workplace, one of which nearly cost me my job. I was moody and irritable \nwith my children and wife. I even sensed that my advisor was a bit perplexed by my struggle. \nFinally, I decided to confine my survey of the literature to only scholarship that I felt directly \naddressed the issue of effectively engaging White people in diversity and inclusion. After \ncombing through all of the 50+ articles at my disposal, I hit on two articles which reviewed \nfive-studies each by Victoria Plaut and Evan Apfelbaum. Their work was well-cited and \nstruck me as highly relevant, rigorous, extensive - each used a five-study series, collaborative \n- each listed five co-authors, and well-written. Moreover, I felt their angle on the topic was \nappreciative and focused on positive solutions rather than problems. Thankfully, this decision \ngot me ‘unstuck’ and allowed me to proceed with the critical work of finishing interviews, \nassembling data, and interpreting the data.   \nThen, one day in early April, as I excitedly anticipated the writing portion of the \nproject, my stomach once again got that sinking feeling. Upon searching for further \nbackground information about Victoria Plaut’s work, I came across her photograph on a \n160 \n \n \n \nfaculty profile. To my surprise, Plaut was White! Perhaps due to prior work she had done \nwith Kecia Thomas, an African American scholar of diversity resistance, I had incorrectly \nassumed that she was Black. This assumption played into the narrative I had developed about \nmy research being an endeavor that would, at least, not recreate historic patterns of \nmarginalization of Peoples of Color scholarly voices. At best, I had hoped that my research \nwould be considered anti-racist since I was turning a lens toward the oft-hidden impacts of \nWhiteness on workplace dynamics. I made an effort to include people of color in many of my \nBut, since I knew Apfelbaum was White based on earlier digging, revealing Plaut’s White \nracial identity was a major strike against my preferred narrative. For, now my Literature \nReview was starting by featuring two White-led research teams. Again, as earlier, my mind \nswirled with questions:  \nSince I had read and reviewed many articles by people of color, how had the research \nof two White people ended up being among the chosen few? Was it really the quality \nand relevance of the work that attracted me to it? Could this be explained by the \noverall dominance of Whites in academia, which would result in a far greater number \nof peer-reviewed work available for me to consider? Or perhaps the angle that they \ntook on the material, and was this a decidedly ‘White’ angle, but I could not tell \nbecause White culture was invisible to me as a White person? Will my audience be \nable to tell and will it matter to them? And, how much do I think it matters that Plaut \nand Apfelbaum are White? For, if their work contributes toward a field whose goal, \nalthough usually unstated, is to create more diverse, equitable, and inclusive \nworkplaces, a goal that helps people of color and other marginalized groups, how \nmuch should it matter that they are White (circa April 1, 2019)? \n161 \n \n \n \nLike the many questions about my recruitment of participants, I had no clear answers. \nHowever, unlike my discovery that the first three interviewees being White, which was \nreviewing a past event that could not be change, my realization that my two most thoroughly- \nreviewed scholars were White created an opportunity for reparative action. I could re-write \nmy literature review and include more scholarship from People of Color. Even if I was still \nfeaturing Apfelbaum and Plaut, I could place precede and follow their work with scholars of \ncolor.  \nBut I did not take these actions. Why? Since the literature review had already given \nme so much difficulty and emotional turmoil, I was loath to reopen this can of worms. I was \ngaining confidence, but still staring down the barrel of a 100 page capstone paper that I had \nyet to begin and was due May 1, a month away. This paper was the final step in fulfilling my \nrequirements for earning a Master’s degree from an Ivy League institution. This is the \nMaster’s degree that I had worked on for six years as a middle-aged husband, father of two \nchildren under 10 years old, and full time employee. Would I be willing to set my process \nback in order to fulfill a commitment that I never made explicit to my capstone committee or \nthe participant-partners, to ensure that more non-White voices were heard in the literature \nreview? I am not proud of it, but the answer was no. I only hope that the benefits this paper \nprovide to the advancement of workplace inclusion far outweigh any damage done by a \nLiterature Review that centers a White perspective on the topic.  \nPerhaps my decision process is emblematic of cost-benefit decision processes that \nleaders make every day regarding promotion of workplace inclusion. To me, a White man, \nthe costs of reopening the Pandora’s Box of my literature review outweighed the possible \nbenefits, either actual or perceived, in increasing the racial diversity of the referenced \n162 \n \n \n \nscholarship. My story may underline the importance of advancing representational diversity \nto support an inclusive workplace in healthcare. My process shows that I, or any healthcare \nleader, cannot divorce my societal privileges, including and especially racial privilege, from \nthe cost-benefit analysis of doing work to promote a more racially equitable world. \nTherefore, increasing representational diversity to get more decision-makers who can \nrepresent black and brown interests is a critical part of promoting overall inclusion for the \nbenefit of all employees. \nHowever, this research paper would never had happened if I, a White man, was not \nengaged in a process of self-discovery by the leaders in my life. These leaders included \nfriends and neighbors, bullies, teachers, activist leaders, supervisors, professors, and \nparticularly co-counselors. They were both White and non-White, women and men, queer \nand straight, and any number of other social identities. They gave me support and love, \nchallenge and push back, and so many ‘disconfirming’ experiences that helped me develop a \npositive non-racist White identity. I have been given space to have painful experiences and \nexpress my emotions. I have made huge mistakes and survived them. I still do make mistakes \nthat, I have no doubt, perpetuate racial inequality and prejudice. I am a work in progress. \nHowever, I believe that the dedication, passion, and attention to quality of this research \nproject demonstrates the power of helping White people to engage with creating a more \nequitable society. \n  \n163 \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAbout Re-evaluation Counseling.

My use of the phrase “participant-partner” communicates \nmy hope that you will get to contribute to and benefit from the research process. \n \nOur one-hour qualitative interview session is being recorded and transcribed to aid data \ncollection and analysis. I will also be taking handwritten notes. The data is confidential and \nyour identity will remain anonymous throughout the research process.  \n \nThere will be three main parts to the interview - one, getting to know you and your overall \napproach to promoting an inclusive workplace, two, hearing your thoughts about, and \nexperiences with, engaging White people with this work, and three, a discussion about how \nyou see this work evolving. \n \nDo you have any questions before we begin?  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[Part 1] \n \n1. What does your typical work day look like? \n- What are your formal and informal responsibilities for promoting DEI? \n- About how long have you held this position/appointment?   \n \n2. What got you into the work of diversity, equity and inclusion?  \n- What do you enjoy about this work? \n- What about the work has been challenging? \n- Could you tell me about a past experience that has been influential for you? \n \n3. How would you describe your overall approach to promoting an inclusive healthcare \nworkplace? (Prompt examples: unconscious bias or cultural competence) \na. Can you describe a recent example of this approach? \nb. Would say your work focuses mostly on structural aspects of inclusion or \ninterpersonal aspect?  \nc. What are you most proud of in terms of your work in this area? \n \n \n \nStatement: Next, I will ask you about the social identities that you think are relevant to your \nwork in this area. As you may know, social identities can be more visible like gender and \nrace, or less visible such as place of origin or class background. For example, the identities \nEFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT OF WHITE EMPLOYEES IN WORKPLACE INCLUSION \nSTRATEGIES IN HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS \n \n \n \n \nthat I believe impact my research include White, male, cis-gender, Jewish, raised middle \nclass, and activist.  \n \n4. Which social identities do you feel most influence your work, and how others \nperceive your work, in promoting an inclusive workplace?  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[Part 2]  \n \n5. How would you describe your approach in helping employees with various identities \nto think about their commonalities and what makes them different? \na. Can you think of an example? \n \n6. When you think about effectively engaging White people in healthcare workplace \ninclusion strategies, what are some thoughts you have?  \n \n7. What behaviors would indicate to you that the White employees in your organization \nare fully engaged in helping create an inclusive workplace? \n- Can you think of any particular moments that stand out, either positively or \nnegatively? \n- Can you think of any examples, either in your organization or another, when you felt \nthat a White person was being effective in helping create an inclusive workplace?  \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n[Part 3] \n \n8. Based upon your experience and expertise, how might you recommend a new \nhealthcare leader go about creating an inclusion strategy that fully engages White \npeople?  \n \n9. How do you see the work of creating an inclusive healthcare workplace developing \nover the next 5-10 years?  \n \n10. What recommendations or resources might you have for me as I move forward in my \nresearch?  \n- Do you have colleagues at other healthcare systems that you feel I should interview as \na part of this study? \n- Are there any reports, websites, or other data you think I should see?  \n \n---------------------- \nThank you very much for your valuable time and attention. I will be in touch! \n",

    "abstract": "This capstone paper explores the subject of effective engagement of White employees in healthcare workforce inclusion strategies. While diversity, equity, and inclusion work in healthcare delivery organizations has become an increasingly high priority, leaders of this function must grapple with engagement of disparate audiences in order to achieve their goals. White employees wield outsized influence in creating a greater sense of inclusion in the workplace yet they are less likely to be engaged in diversity & inclusion work. The limited attention that this topic has received from academia was explored in three sections: (1) diversity approach, (2) Whiteness, which included work on privilege, ‘fragility’, and positive identity development, and (3) case studies. Qualitative interviews of 16 practitioners with diverse profiles produced findings regarding their overall approach, approaches to difference and commonality, and the effective engagement of White employees. Three participants voiced a concern about the framing of the research topic; their objections were valuable in highlighting the dialectical and strategic conflicts regarding a focus on racial identity. The participants largely agreed that the White encounter with workplace inclusion was exceptional, that psychological safety was paramount, and that development of positive work identities and relationships were key considerations. The participants’ preferred strategic frames were mixed between healthcare quality, business, and social justice. The participants’ leadership strategies to engage Whites were closely related to best practices for leading organizational culture change. After a synthesis of the extant literature and the interview findings, four critical insights were offered. The paper ends with a personal reflection",
