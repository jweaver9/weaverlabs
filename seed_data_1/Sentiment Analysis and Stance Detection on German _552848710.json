    "abstract": "[EN] This paper explores different options of detecting the stance of German YouTube comments regarding the topic of gender diversity and compares the respective results with those of sentiment analysis, showing that these are two very different NLP tasks focusing on distinct characteristics of the discourse. While an already existing model was used to analyze the comments  sentiment (BERT), the comments  stance was first annotated and then used to train different models   SVM with TF-IDF, DistilBERT, LSTM and CNN   for predicting the stance of unseen comments. The best results were achieved by the CNN, reaching 78.3% accuracy (92% after dataset normalization) on the test set. Whereas the most common stance identified in the comments is a neutral one (neither completely in favor nor completely against gender diversity), the overall sentiment of the discourse turns out to be negative. This shows that the discourse revolving around the topic of gender diversity in YouTube comments is filled with strong opinions, on the one hand, but also opens up a space for anonymously inquiring and learning about the topic and its implications, on the other. Our research thereby (1) contributes to the understanding and application of different NLP tasks used to predict the sentiment and stance of unstructured textual data, and (2) provides relevant insights into society s attitudes towards a changing system of values and beliefs.Melnyk, L.; Feld, L.
