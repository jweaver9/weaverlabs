But much of the debate is based onspeculation: until now, the data to conduct detailed andsystematic measurement of how and where land isconverted to urban use have simply not been available. Our research fills that gap by merging high-altitude photos from 1976 with satellite images from1992 to create a grid of 8.7 billion 30-metre by 30-metre cells that tracks the evolution of land use across the whole of the continental United States.These new high-resolution data make it possible to observe the amount of open space in theneighbourhood of every house in every US city. Sincethere is more open space around a house that is far from its neighbours, development is more scattered asthis quantity of open space increases. Thus, we canmeasure urban sprawl by calculating the average amountof open space in the neighbourhood of a house in each city. So is urban sprawl really increasing? In fact, we find thatresidential development in 1992 is no more scattered thandevelopment was in 1976. The proportion of open spacein the square kilometre of land surrounding the averageresidential development was 42% in 1976 compared with43% in 1992. While a substantial amount of scatteredresidential development was built between 1976 and1992, overall residential development did not become anymore biased towards such sprawling areas.Of course, any one household might have seen a greatdeal of change over this period. But if we zoom out andlook at the city from a distance, we see little change, atleast in terms of the proportions of sprawling and compactdevelopment. The new city is just like an enlarged versionof the old city.We also investigate why some cities are more sprawlingthan others, and find that a city’s climate, topography andaccess to groundwater account for 25% of the variation.For example, when the climate is temperate, people spreadNew research by Henry Overman and colleagues provides adetailed picture of how land is used in US cities – andchallenges conventional wisdom about urban sprawl.in brief...Figure 1 (this page):Urban land and aquifersin San Antonio andAustin, TexasFigure 2 (opposite page):Urban land andincorporated places in St. Louis, Missouri0    10    20 Kilometers0         10        20 MilesRoads have no impact on sprawl;climate, topography and access togroundwater doCentrePiece Summer 20063out to have more space to enjoy the weather. Similarly,hilly places see more scattered development as peopleavoid the costs of building on hillsides. But mountains actas a barrier and lead to more compact development.Places with easy access to groundwater also see morescattered development since people can supply remotehouses with water by drilling inexpensive wells rather thanpaying for water lines. The presence of aquifers isparticularly important (as illustrated in Figure 1, whichshows the relationship between aquifers and sprawl in SanAntonio and Austin, Texas). This implies that controllingaccess to groundwater is a way to control whetherdevelopment sprawls or not.Roads, in contrast, have no impact on developmentpatterns, despite commonly held beliefs to the contrary.Taking various measures of road density – miles of road perarea, average distance to a road and distance to aninterstate exit – we find no relationship with thescatteredness of development. This suggests that the roadnetwork tends to follow development patterns rather thanvice versa.The number of municipalities in a metropolitan area also has no effect on development patterns. Butdevelopment near cities is less scattered if it occurs in amunicipality as opposed to an unincorporated area of acounty (as Figure 2 – a map of St. Louis, Missouri –depicts). This suggests that people may be moving justbeyond municipal boundaries to avoid more stringentmunicipal regulations. One of the common complaints about urban sprawl is thatas development spreads, municipal services such as roads,sewers, police and fire protection are more expensive. Itturns out that this concern is well founded. Developmentin municipalities that receive larger government subsidiesis, on average, more scattered. This suggests that whenlocal taxpayers are held accountable for infrastructurecosts, they respond by insisting on patterns ofdevelopment that require less infrastructure spending.Overall, cities are not sprawlingmore than they used to: the new city is just like an enlargedversion of the old cityThis article summarises ‘Causes ofSprawl: A Portrait from Space’ by MarcyBurchfield, Henry Overman, Diego Pugaand Matthew Turner, Quarterly Journalof Economics 121:2 (May 2006).The photographs are from page 598,©2006 by the President and Fellows ofHarvard College and the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology.Marcy Burchfield is at the NeptisFoundation.

Among its manytargets were these for employment andgrowth: by 2010, the EU should haveemployment rates for the working-age (15-64) population as close as possible to70%, for women at least 60% and for the55-64 age group 50%; and as the maindriver of growth, spending on research anddevelopment (R&D) should be at least 3%of GDP, with two thirds or more done bythe private sector.These targets are unlikely to beachieved. Progress has been slow and acomparison between the EU and otherOECD countries shows that although somecountries improved their employmentperformance, in the first five years sinceLisbon, no country that was below theCentrePiece Summer 20064In a world of rapid technological progress andincreasing international competition, how canEuropean countries improve their poor employmentperformance? Christopher Pissarides argues that much needs to change in the lower productivity, more labour-intensive service sectors of the economy.What future forEuropean jobs?40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%90%80%70%60%50%40%EU-15EU-newOther OECD countriesFigure 1:Employment rates in 1999 and 2004Percentage of working age population who were employed in 2004Percentage of working age population who were employed in 1999Source: OECD Employment OutlookCentrePiece Summer 2006570% line in 1999 progressed sufficiently fartowards the line by 2004 (see Figure 1).What explains this failure? It seems tome that the central problem is not a lack ofknowledge of what policies can work butone of implementation. The EuropeanEmployment Strategy of 1997 containedseveral specific measures designed toincrease job creation. The OECD hasrepeatedly emphasised increased flexibility,adaptability, active labour market measuresfor the unemployed and lower taxes, atleast for those at the lower end of thewage distribution. Similar recommendationswere made by the European EmploymentTaskforce, which reported in 2003.A key part of the problem seems to bethat although the types of policies neededare universal (they apply to all countries),the processes needed to implement themare not. The latter must be decided at thenational level within the context of theinstitutions and objectives of the nationalgovernment, which is much more difficult.And there are likely to be objections frommany stakeholders with vested interests inthe status quo.My objective here is not to look at eachcountry’s labour market performance andrecommend specific measures for reform.Instead, I want to look at policies that can,in principle, be effective in achieving theoverall employment targets set at Lisbon.The novel feature of my approach isthat it puts policy in the context of thedynamic evolution of the Europeaneconomy in a world of rapid technologicalprogress and increasing internationalcompetition. We need to understand theunderlying causes of low employment inEurope in relation to growth and economicdevelopment before a policy prescriptioncan be made.The connection between jobsand growthThe Lisbon agenda emphasises the‘knowledge economy’, which essentiallymeans jobs and growth in high-techsectors. But much of the job expansion thatis needed to satisfy its targets will be inlabour-intensive sectors of the economy,which experience low productivity growth.So job creation is not likely to be the maincontributor to growth.Indeed, the link runs the other way:more growth will bring job creation. Thereis evidence, for example, that increasing thegrowth rate of labour productivity increasesthe demand for labour, reducesunemployment and increases participation.My research (Pissarides and Vallanti, 2004)finds that increasing productivity growth by1 percentage point reduces unemploymentby about 1.3 percentage points. Suchchanges in the growth rate in Europe arefeasible given the low starting points.Of course, high growth is not spreaduniformly across the economy. Somesectors will inevitably grow faster thanothers. And high growth usually does notcreate many jobs in the sectors thatexperience it: rather, it creates wealth,which in turn creates demand for services elsewhere.The jobs growth that comes withproductivity growth is more widespreadacross the economy than the productivitygrowth itself, and usually more heavilyconcentrated in low productivity sectorssuch as retail trade and medical care. Thepeople who take these jobs need to becompensated sufficiently to give them theincentives to enter employment. Highcompensation in the low-growth sectors isachieved through high prices for their finalproducts, not through more productive useof resources. This is why we experiencemore price inflation and more job creationin low-productivity service sectors.The European jobs deficitHow do we know that most jobs will becreated in low-productivity sectors? First, inrecent European history, employment hasbeen moving out of agriculture and intothe low-productivity service sectors, withmanufacturing showing either a small fallor no change. In countries that completedthe transition out of agriculture early, suchas the UK and the United States, thesubsequent transition was mainly out ofmanufacturing and again into services.Importantly, however, although averagehours of work decline with economicdevelopment, there is also pressure in thesecountries for an increase in the participationrates of working-age women, especiallythose aged 15-50. So historically, Europeancountries should expect that given theirsmall agricultural sectors, there will bepressures on their manufacturing sectors tocontract, as well as pressures for anincrease in women’s employment rates.The pressures on manufacturing tocontract are likely to intensify with theemergence of large Asian manufacturingproducers. Trade and export-led growth canprovide a cushion for manufacturing, ashappened in Japan and Germany in the last30 years, but it is not likely to continue inthe future. Europe has to face the reality ofthe dynamics of the 21st century: mostemployment growth is likely to come toservice sectors that do not rely on high-techknowledge or trade.In some ways, this is good news for theLisbon employment targets. Economicforces in Europe should be creatingdemand for job creation in sectors of theEurope’s jobs deficit is in sectors that are labour-intensive with lowproductivity growthCentrePiece Summer 20066economy that can easily be met with theexisting stock of human capital. Butcreating demand is not equivalent tocreating jobs.The United States is the most advancedcountry in this dynamic economic process.Its manufacturing sector is shrinking andservice employment is rising; women’slabour market participation is also rising. Asa result, the main gaps in employment nowbetween Europe and the United States arein service employment. Productionindustries and agriculture occupy more orless the same fraction of people. CanEurope expect a similar dynamic evolutionas the one experienced by the UnitedStates and if so, can it sit back and wait fornatural economic forces to satisfy theLisbon targets?This is a difficult question, but given thedifferent performance of countries withinEurope, despite their similar level ofeconomic development, the answer isprobably no, at least in the foreseeablefuture. Big gaps remain in employmentbetween Europe and the United States, andwithin Europe, mainly between the northand the south. These gaps are mainly inbusiness services (such as finance, retail andtransport) and community services (mainlyin health and education).Figure 2 shows the gaps in the twotypes of services. The main gaps are inbusiness services, with only the UKsurpassing the United States because of itslarge financial sector. But there are alsosubstantial gaps in community services,with the exception of the Scandinaviancountries (Sweden and Denmark), whichhave many community services supportedmostly by the state.Figure 3 breaks down theemployment gaps in the business sector.Here the biggest gaps are in retail andwholesale trade. The gaps in transportand communication are relatively small.There are also gaps in financial services,mainly in business services connected withreal estate and in the provision of avariety of other services to employers.Thebiggest gaps in financial services are inthe southern European countries. Figure 4 shows employment growth inthe business services sector. Over the last30 years, European countries have beenachieving good rates of growth in finance,real estate and insurance services, whichinclude high-tech computing services. Butthey have not been able to match the USrate of growth in the retail and wholesaletrade sector, which is the one of this groupcharacterised by lower productivity growth.It is clear that the jobs deficit in Europeis in sectors that are labour-intensive withlow productivity growth. Europe has beencreating jobs in the knowledge economy ata comparable scale to the United States,although it has not substantially closed thegap yet. But the low-growth sectors in theUnited States attract big numbers ofworkers, especially women, which are notmatched in Europe.Compensation in these jobs is good inthe United States because the prices oftheir final products are relatively high. Thefact that consumers can afford to pay thehigh prices is itself the result of more-5%0%5%10%15%20%■ Business services■ Community servicesSpainItalyPortugalFinlandAustriaBelgiumFranceGermanySwedenDenmarkNetherlandsUKFigure 2:The employment gap in business and communityservices between the United States and EU countriesUS-EU gap in proportion of working age populationemployed in sectorSource: OECD STAN database (online)-2%0%2%4%6%8%10%SpainFinlandItalyPortugalFranceBelgiumSwedenAustriaGermanyDenmarkNetherlandsUK■ Wholesale and retail trade■ Transport and communication■ Finance, restaurants and hotels, insuranceFigure 3:The employment gap in business services sectorsbetween the United States and EU countriesDifference in percentage of working age populationemployed in sectorSource: OECD STAN database (online)CentrePiece Summer 20067employment. When women leave thehome to take employment, they createdemand for market services such ascleaning, food preparation and childcare,which creates more jobs for others.Why are Europeaneconomies not creating somany jobs?The same pressures for an increase in theconsumption of business and communityservices are present in Europe. Europe hasmore or less caught up with the UnitedStates in productivity per hour, butbecause Americans work more hours,income per head is higher.But do Americans really work morehours than Europeans? Americans workmore hours in the market and so createmore jobs, but they work fewer hours athome. Recent research (Freeman andSchettkat, 2005) on the hours worked byAmericans and Europeans concludes thatthey work approximately the samenumber of hours, but Europeans workmuch more in the home than Americans(see Table 1). The difference betweenmarket and home allocation is particularlymarked for women.European women work on average 8hours less than American women in themarket, but they work 10 hours more inthe home. They do more housemaintenance, they cook more at homeand they look after relatives. They areengaged in ‘home production’, somethingAmericans do much less.The Lisbon targets imply thatEuropeans should move to the market by‘marketising’ their home production. It is,of course, debatable whether this is agood policy to encourage, but how couldit be done?The natural conclusion is that toincrease employment in Europe, we needto make the market more accessible towomen, who now shy away from marketwork, and we need to create good jobsin labour-intensive sectors of theeconomy. It is interesting, andencouraging for Europe, that the sectors that lag behind the United Statesin job creation are women-friendlysectors: retailing, restaurants and hotels,and community services such as childcareand nursing care. Men need not bedisplaced from their current jobs to makeroom for women.An explanation why the marketpressures that have given rise to moreemployment in the United States have nothad the same impact in Europe runs asfollows. Consumers work out the relativecost of buying some services in themarket versus providing them at home.When the price of market goods relativeto per capita incomes is lower, morehouseholds will choose to use the marketfor services that have close substitutes inthe home. So to understand whyEuropeans use the market less thanAmericans, we need to look at the factorsthat influence the relative costs of buyingin the market versus producing at home.There cannot be large differences inthe cost of producing services at home inEurope and the United States. Consumerdurables are widely available and homesare as well equipped in Europe as they arein the United States. The factors that canexplain the differences in employmentpatterns in Europe and the United Statesmust therefore be in the returns tomarket work and in the cost of buyingservices from the market. Theinterpretation of these costs must begeneral, to include convenience factorsand not only prices and wages.Several factors are contributing tomaking the products of market work inEurope too expensive for consumers andmarket work itself unattractive forworkers. And the two issues are, ofcourse, interconnected: if there arefeatures that make market workunattractive, they could be offset by higher prices for the final product; but higher prices would then choke offdemand and so reduce employment.-0.500.50.10.150.20.250.3FinlandNetherlandsBelgiumPortugalAustriaSpainDenmarkSwedenUKItalyGermanyFranceUSA■ Wholesale and retail trade■ Finance, restaurants and hotels, insuranceFigure 4:Average annual change in employment rate inbusiness services sectors, 1970-2004Percentage points per annumSource: OECD STAN database (online)Table 1:Weekly hours of work of men and women aged 25-54 in theUnited States and Europe in the early 1990sMen WomenMarket Home Total Market Home TotalUnited States 44.1 16.1 60.2 28.7 30.1 58.8European Union 43.4 13.6 57.0 20.7 40.5 61.2Source: Freeman and Schettkat (2005)CentrePiece Summer 20068What can make market workmore attractive?So the key question is what can makemarket work more attractive, especially towomen? First, there are various restrictionson market work, which, althoughindividually seemingly unimportant, whenaggregated they add up to a lot. Theseinclude flexibility in market work hours,flexibility in shop opening times, and theavailability of inexpensive childcare services(see Freeman and Schettkat, 2005). Thesetypes of facilities make it easier for womenwith children, and for those withoutchildren who have a household to run, toenter employment.Examples of European countries thathave liberalised restrictions and succeededin increasing women’s employment to theLisbon targets, include the Netherlands andthe UK. Both countries have very largenumbers of part-time jobs and, in the UKat least, evenings and weekends are thebusiest times in the shops. TheScandinavian countries have alsosucceeded in raising women’s employment.A factor here is not just widely availablechildcare, but also the fact that many ofthe community services marketised in theUnited States are provided by the state,which employs large numbers of women.Another important factor in theemployment of women is education.Employment differentials across countriesare lower at higher educationalattainments. Women with universitydegrees have similar rates of employmenteverywhere. Of course, it would take along time for substantially more women toacquire university degrees and gainemployment. But the impact of highereducation on women’s employment is notone-for-one. When more women acquireeducation and gain employment, theycreate demand for the services of otherwomen with less education. There is a‘multiplier’ effect of education, whichbrings to the market a larger number ofwomen than the ones leaving college withhigher qualifications.The initiative to increase education inEurope comes from the state. But for it tobe effective, two pre-conditions need to besatisfied. First, women need to know thatjobs will be available and that they wouldbe compensated as well as men’s jobs.There is EU legislation againstdiscrimination, but it is not alwayseffectively implemented (see Boeri et al,2005). Increasing the effectiveness oflegislation and making working conditionsgood for women will certainly improve thechances of satisfying the Lisbon targets. Inthe United States, there has been high-profile anti-discrimination legislation sincethe early 1970s and it has contributed tothe expansion of women’s employment.The second pre-condition is that highlyqualified women need to know that therewill be less qualified people around, mainlywomen, prepared to do the tasks normallydone in the home. This is where childcareservices are vital, but equally important(because they affect larger numbers ofwomen) is the availability of peopleprepared to work as cleaners and inrestaurants and laundries.To achieve this, the EU needs to thinkseriously about unskilled migration and itspotential contribution to the Lisbonagenda. In Cyprus, for example,employment levels are within the Lisbontargets. Educational levels and women’semployment rates are unusually high for aMediterranean country. These rates aresupported by large numbers of unskilledimmigrants on regulated fixed-termcontracts, working in business andcommunity services, mostly domesticservice, nursing and retailing.Making it easier foremployersJob creation needs to be attractive topotential employers too. An obvious policyreform here is that labour markets shouldbe liberalised, especially at the lower endof the skills distribution. This is not new: ithas been emphasised in numerous writingsby the OECD and the EuropeanCommission. But reforms have not beenforthcoming.The administrative burden oncompanies, especially new, smallercompanies, certainly explains some of thegaps in service jobs. Jobs in business andcommunity services are frequentlyperformed within small companies or byindividuals working on their own account.If these individuals are to be attracted tothe market, it is important that setting upa small company and running it should beeasy and inexpensive.For example, there should be onewindow for completing all the necessaryadministrative work for a new company,setting it up should be completed within aweek and the company should not berequired to report detailed accounts andregister for VAT if turnover is expected tobe below a certain (generous) limit. Directassistance from the state for newentrepreneurs is also important.A study of the French retail sector(Bertrand and Kramarz, 2002) finds thatbarriers to the setting up of supermarketshave a negative impact on the local labourmarket. And other studies find thatunimpeded entrepreneurship helps in boththe diffusion of new technologies and theadaptation of businesses to newchallenges. Diffusion and adaptability areimportant for Europe in a world with thetwin challenges of technological catch-upwith the United States and globalisation.Indeed, with these two challenges,adaptability is more important than R&Dgeared to new discoveries.Another obvious factor in theattractiveness of job creation that hasattracted a lot of attention recently istaxation, which can discourage bothemployers and employees. This followsEdward Prescott’s claim that the entire gapbetween European and American hours ofwork can be explained by taxation, whichmakes work in the home relatively moreattractive because it is not taxed.Econometric evidence has so far failedto find a large impact of taxation onemployment, and Prescott’s work has beencriticised for failing to distinguish betweendifferent types of taxation and the uses towhich the tax revenue is put, which mustinfluence the impact that taxation has onemployment. Nevertheless, taxation clearlyhas a bigger impact on economic activityat the lower end of the productivitydistribution. Profit margins and net gainsfrom employment are smaller whenproductivity is lower so a given tax takes abigger proportional slice of net gain.It is now widely accepted that capitalshould not be taxed much because it ismobile: if one country taxes it, capital willflee to another. The experience with homeand market work in Europe shows thatlow-wage labour is also mobile, betweenthe home and the market. Based on theEffective labour marketreforms include moreflexible employment and lower taxation oflow-wage jobs CentrePiece Summer 20069same principle, low-wage market workshould not be taxed much either.Otherwise, it will flee to the home.What can the EuropeanCommission do?The most important reforms needed toachieve the Lisbon targets are at thenational level. Not all EU countries needthe same reforms and it is up to individualgovernments to decide what is mosturgent for their situation. But can theCommission help in any way other thangiving advice and exerting moral pressure?The answer is yes – and althoughmuch has been done, much remains to do.The report of Wim Kok’s group (EuropeanCommission, 2004) highlights five areas ofpolicy that require urgent action. Four ofthem are firmly in the national domain:encouraging R&D; improving the businessclimate; improving the performance of thelabour market; and ensuring environmentalsustainability. But the fifth – thecompletion of the single market – mainlyrequires action from European institutions.Market integration is importantbecause European companies can takeadvantage of economies of scale. Prices ofgoods are generally lower in the UnitedStates than in Europe and the reason isthat US companies have better distributionnetworks and make better use ofdiversified locations within the UnitedStates. Europe can do the same, but it isnot doing it yet.The main benefits from Europeanintegration so far have been the benefitsfrom free trade. The Commission estimatesthat in the first 10 years of the singlemarket, European GDP gained about1.5%. This is not very much comparedwith the annual rate of growth of GDP,corresponding to about a year’s growth.There have also been some gains in jobcreation but with respect to services, thebiggest component of GDP, integration hasnot yet taken place.The Kok report rightly emphasises thatefforts towards completing the singlemarket should be stepped up, especially inthe liberalisation of services. Even financialservices are not fully integrated, althoughthere is an agreement that they should be.On paper, integration is complete in thegoods sector, but the large differences inprices that remain across Europe areevidence that it has not yet fully takenplace. The limits here may be due tocorporate policies and not a matter ofnational policies. If that is the case, theCommission can again take action toimprove integration.Beyond this channel, the Commissionhas mainly emphasised the need for reformand more effort to achieve the Lisbontargets. But it has not taken concreteaction. The failure to take the necessaryaction at the national level is partly theresult of countries not doing what theysaid they would do, and partly not sayingor doing what is needed.The Commission could work out asystem or incentives to make countriesmore willing to take on the necessarymeasures. For example, it could give somefinancial compensation for research andother spending that is now financed bynational budgets but which contributes tothe Lisbon targets. Financial aid orincentives have not been tied closely to thetargets. If the Commission wishes toaccelerate the reform process, this is onearea in which it could contribute a lot.Conclusions■ The job creation required to achieve theLisbon targets will be mainly in sectorswith low productivity growth: retailtrade, a variety of business services andcommunity services.■ European countries have been successfulat creating jobs in the ‘knowledgesectors’, such as financial services, buthave been unsuccessful at creating themin the more labour-intensive servicesectors.■ Most new employment will come fromwomen now outside the labour forceand it will ‘marketise’ many of theservices now done in the home, such aschildcare and other personal care,cleaning, shopping, etc.■ To achieve the new job creation,employment needs to be made morewomen-friendly through more flexibilityof working hours, more flexibility inshop opening hours and easieravailability of domestic service.■ Education needs to be further advancedand supported by less expensiveimmigrant labour in the labour-intensiveservice sectors, including the home.■ Other essential labour market reformsinclude an increase in the flexibility ofemployment, less taxation of low-wagejobs and fewer administrative burdenson new entrepreneurs.■ Finally, the failures of the Lisbon agendaare not due to a lack of knowledge ofthe principles behind the right policiesbut a lack of urgency in the reform andimplementation process needed to putthose principles into practice.This is an edited version of the keynoteaddress by Christopher Pissarides deliveredat the Austrian Presidency conference onInnovations in Labour Market Policies:Challenges in Times of Globalisation, Vienna,16-17 February 2006.

Most of the positivefindings are inferred from simplecorrelations between ICT and test scores.These cannot take account of unobservedschool characteristics – such as moremotivated teachers – that may lead to bothICT adoption and better attainments.Indeed, starting with work by JoshuaAngrist and Victor Lavy, a small number ofeconomic studies, applying more rigorousmethods of analysis, have found it hard touncover any evidence of a positive causalrelationship between computers (and/orcomputer software) and pupil performance.This has not stopped the UKgovernment seeing ICT investment inschools as ‘crucial to our drive to raisestandards’ (former secretary of state foreducation Ruth Kelly) and envisaging ICTbeing widely used across the wholecurriculum in all state schools (seeDepartment for Education and Skills (DfES),2003, and Office for Standards inEducation (Ofsted), 2001).The positive rhetoric has been backedup by considerable public investment.Between 1998 and 2002, ICT expenditurealmost doubled in English secondaryschools – from an average of £40,100 tojust under £75,300 per school, or 3% ofoverall expenditure – and more than trebledin primary schools – from £3,600 in 1998New technology in schools:is there a payoff?Economists have typically been sceptical that computers improveeducational outcomes. But research by Stephen Machin, SandraMcNally and Olmo Silva finds evidence that new technology canhave a positive effect on pupils’ performance.Table 1:How was ICT money spent in schools?Percentage devoted to different items1999/00 2001/02 Percentage Primary schools changeHardware 63 53 -16Software 10 10 0Internet 8 7 -12Training 7 11 +57Technical support 9 13 +44Administration + other 3 6 +100Total expenditure per school £10,000 £14,100 +41Secondary schoolsHardware 57 55 -3.5Software 9 9 0Internet 4 3 -25Training 4 6 +50Technical support 14 17 +21Administration + other 12 10 -17Total expenditure per school £56,500 £76,000 +34.5Source: Authors’ calculations from ICT Survey of Schools in England (DfES)Large increases in ICT funding have improved educationalperformance in primary schoolsCentrePiece Summer 200611to £12,900 in 2002, or 2% of overallexpenditure. Most of this dramaticacceleration took place from 2000 and theupward trend continued in 2003 and 2004.Table 1 shows how primary andsecondary schools used these resources in2000 and 2002. Between these years, theshare of ICT expenditure devoted tohardware and software actually decreased –by 16% in primary schools and 3.5% insecondary schools – but as the totalamount of ICT funding was increasing,overall expenditure in these two categoriesgrew steadily.Interestingly, the share of resourcesdevoted to teacher training rose by 57%for primary schools and 50% for secondaryschools between 2000 and 2002. Thissuggests that the extra funding may haveimproved the quality of ICT use in schools,not simply increasing the quantity of ICT equipment. Table 2 provides a more completepicture of schools’ ICT use, showing hownew technology and training grew inresponse to the extra resources. Althoughschools were already well resourced, therewere quite sizeable changes between 2000and 2003. For example, the pupils tocomputer ratio in 2000 was 10 to 1 inprimary schools and 7 to 1 in secondaryschools; by 2003, the respective ratios were6 to 1 and 4 to 1.The indicators of ICT use in theclassroom also show fairly high percentageincreases over this short time period. What’smore, the fraction of teachers trained touse ICT grew substantially. This confirmsour intuition that rather than just increasingthe quantity of ICT equipment, schools alsoinvested in the quality of ICT use.Although secondary schools werebetter equipped with ICT in 2000, thegreatest relative increase over time wasexperienced in primary schools. It is alsonotable that ICT is used regularly forteaching purposes in a much higherpercentage of primary schools thansecondary schools. Any effect of ICT oneducational performance is therefore likelyto be more evident in primary schools thansecondary schools.We also have evidence that ICT iswidely used in primary schools to teachEnglish: 65% of primary schools report thatthey ‘substantially use’ ICT for teaching thissubject. The next most important ‘ICT user’is Mathematics, where ICT is ‘substantiallyused’ in about 56% of primary schools,followed by Science (35%).So has the big increase in ICTinvestment made a difference toeducational standards? Our researchevaluates whether changes in ICTinvestment had any causal impact onchanges in educational outcomes in Englishschools between 1999 and 2003. To dothis, we rely mainly on administrative dataat the level of local education authorities(LEAs), focusing on average achievementsat the end of primary education in English,Mathematics and Science. Following DfEStargets, we look at the proportion of pupilsachieving level 4 or above in the threesubjects at age 11, the end of Key Stage 2.Inferring a causal relationship betweenICT investments and pupil achievementsfrom simple correlations can be misleading.For example, we could imagine that schoolsor LEAs with more motivated teachers andhead teachers are both more likely to adoptICT and to produce better attainments:then, if we did not control for motivations,and just related ICT use to pupil tests, apositive relationship may emerge justbecause of this unobserved common factor(motivation) driving both observedoutcomes.To overcome this problem and identifythe causal impact of ICT use on pupilachievement, we exploit a 2001 policychange that modified the rules for ICTinvestment in different regions of England.Table 2:Trends in ICT expenditure and use of ICT resources Primary schools Secondary schools1999/00 2002/03 Percentage 1999/00 2002/03 Percentage change changeComputers per pupil 0.10 0.16 +60 0.15 0.23 +53Percentage of teachers using ICT regularly 75 92 +23 38 55 +45Percentage of teachers trained to use ICT 81 95 +17 75 83 +11Percentage of teachers with recently updated training 57 85 +49 48 69 +44Percentage of schools connected to the internet 86 100 +16 99 100 +1Source: Authors’ calculations from ICT Survey of Schools in England (DfES)The positive impact ofICT investment is mostevident in the teachingof English CentrePiece Summer 2006Before 2001, funding was allocated fromcentral government to LEAs through abidding process, aiming to direct moneytowards LEAs with innovative andinteresting proposals for the use of ICT funds.From 2001 onwards, allocations wereinstead made according to a formula basedon school and pupil numbers in LEAs withan adjustment for population density. Thechange in the allocation mechanismcreated ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ among LEAs:areas that had benefited a lot under the oldsystem stood to lose from the transition toa formula-based system, and vice versa. In our analysis, we argue (and provideevidence) that money was reshuffled acrossLEAs in a ‘random’ way, that is, in a wayunrelated to unobservable LEAcharacteristics that may give rise to aspurious relationship between ICT fundingand test scores. We then use the changesin the ICT funding accruing to LEAs toestimate the effects of ICT expenditure oneducational standards. Our approachidentifies the effect of being a winner or aloser in the new system of ICT allocation. We estimate the effect of changes inICT funding per pupil on changes inachievements in English, Mathematics andScience at the end of primary education.We find a positive relationship between ICTfunding per pupil and performance inEnglish: a doubling of ICT funding per pupilin schools leads to a 2 percentage pointincrease in the proportion of pupilsachieving level 4 or above at age 11.Changes in ICT funding of thismagnitude really did happen for primaryschools over this period, and the impact onperformance in English is notable given thatthe average growth rate of pupils' scores inthis subject was around 7% between 1999and 2003. But it is important to note thatthis causal effect of ICT is not an averageeffect for all schools in England. Rather, it isthe causal effect of large changes in ICTinvestment for LEAs that were substantiallyaffected by the rule change – the winners.For Mathematics, the impact of ICT ontest scores is very close to zero. But there isa positive relationship between ICT andachievements in Science: in this case, a doubling of ICT funding per pupil leads to an increase of 1.6 percentage points inthe proportion of pupils achieving level 4 or above.So, unlike previous economic studies,we find evidence for a positive causalimpact of ICT investment on educationalperformance in primary schools. This ismost evident in the teaching of English,where we also find high use of ICT forteaching purposes. We also observe apositive impact for Science, though not forMathematics. How can we reconcile ourevidence with previous research that findsno effect? Our estimates identify the impact ofbeing a winner or a loser under the newsystem. After the policy change, theaverage growth rate of ICT funds amongLEAs mostly benefiting from the reformwas roughly 60%. This contrasts with amuch smaller change of 20% for LEAs thatlost more from the introduction of theformula-based system. Intuitively, it is thecomparison between these two groups thatdrives our identification of the impact ofICT on educational outcomes: our strategymainly captures the impact of largechanges in ICT investment on primaryschool performance. LEAs benefiting most from the policychange were LEAs with lower overallexpenditure per pupil but bettereducational standards (as measured byexam pass rates and truancy rates). Thissuggests that resources were redirected toareas that were in a better position to usethem efficiently. Furthermore, newtechnology was already in place in Englishschools since the mid-1990s, and moneyredirected after the policy change wasmainly spent in updating resources andteachers’ skills.So it appears to be the joint effect oflarge increases in ICT funding – and a fertilebackground for making efficient use of it –that led to the positive effects of ICTexpenditure on educational performance.This article summarises ‘New Technology inSchools: Is There a Payoff?’ by StephenMachin, Sandra McNally and Olmo Silva,Discussion Paper No. 55 from the Centre forthe Economics of Education at CEP(http://cee.lse.ac.uk/cee%20dps/ceedp55.pdf).The authors are all CEE researchers andactive members of CEP’s wider researchprogramme on education and skills.Further readingJoshua Angrist and Victor Lavy (2002), ‘NewEvidence on Classroom Computers and PupilLearning’, Economic Journal 112, 735-65.Department for Education and Skills (2003),Fulfilling the Potential: Transforming Teachingand Learning through ICT in Schools.Heather Kirkpatrick and Larry Cuban (1998),‘Computers Make Kids Smarter – Right?’,TECHNOS Quarterly for Education andTechnology 7(2), 1-11.Office for Standards in Education (2001), ICTin Schools: The Impact of GovernmentInitiatives: An Interim Report.BF Skinner (1954), ‘The Science of Learningand the Art of Teaching’, Harvard EducationalReview 24, 86-97.BF Skinner (1958), ‘Teaching Machines’,Science 128, 969-77.Schools have invested not just inmore ICT equipment but also,through teacher training, in betterquality ICT useThe pay gap betweenmen and women hasfallen quitedramatically over thepast 30 years thougha sizeable gap stillremains. But thisheadline figure masks some less positivedevelopments in recent years. We are usedto each generation of women makingprogress relative to the one before. But thisprocess has slowed substantially with thecurrent generation doing only slightly betterthan the previous one.Figure 1 shows how the gender paygap has evolved over the lifecycle of fourgenerations of women – from those bornin 1945-54 to those born in 1975-84. Forall four generations, the gender pay gapstarts off low (or even negative) and thenrises before falling somewhat for olderworkers.Each generation of women has donebetter relative to men than the previousgeneration, but the pace of improvementhas slowed. For example, women born in1965-74 have a gender pay gap 8percentage points below those born in1955-64. But the generation born in 1975-84 is only doing 2 percentage points betterthan women born in 1965-74. As thegender pay gap at the age of 30 is about20%, this suggests it will take 150 years atthe present rate of progress for this gap todisappear!It is very likely that the headline genderpay gap will continue to fall quitesubstantially for several years as womenretiring from the labour market (currentlythose born in the 1940s) will have muchhigher gender pay gaps than new entrants.But that change is more the product ofdiscrimination 30 or 40 years ago thanwhat is happening now. The slowing progress of women So why has the progress of womenslowed? There are two main explanations.First, discrimination against women used tobe blatant whereas it is now more subtle.Half a century ago, many employersoperated a marriage bar preventing womenfrom working once they were married.Before the 1970 Equal Pay Act, it wasroutine for collective agreements to havewomen’s pay rates below those of men.The abolition of such discriminatorypractices had a big effect on the genderpay gap. But it is much harder now to findpractices that have such a large effect andcan be directly influenced by policy.The second explanation for slowingprogress is revealed in Figure 2, whichshows the gender gap in employment ratesfor the same four generations of women inFigure 1. The generation born in 1965-74had much higher levels of labour marketattachment than previous generations. Butthe most recent generation of women –those born in 1975-84 – does not have anystronger attachment to the labour marketthan the previous generation.Although the gender gap inemployment rates for the 1975-84generation is small among young workers,it still grows fast. By the age of 30, theemployment rate of men is still 20CentrePiece Summer 200613-20%15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55-10%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%■ Born 1975-84■ Born 1965-74■ Born 1955-64■ Born 1945-54Figure 1:The gender pay gap and the lifecycle for different birth cohortsGender pay gapAgeThe gender pay gapIn its recent report on how to make further progress in closing the genderpay gap, the Women and Work Commission emphasises policyinterventions before women enter the labour market. Alan Manning issceptical about their likely effectiveness.CentrePiece Summer 200614available to those who want to workpart-time, extending the right to requestflexible working and helping womenreturning to the labour market with jobsearch and skill acquisition.What is different about theserecommendations is the emphasis onaction before or soon after entry into thelabour market. This contrasts with thegeneral thrust of policy over the past 30years to reduce women’s disadvantage atwork – including the Equal Pay Act, the1975 Sex Discrimination Act, strongermaternity rights and rights for part-timeworkers and the right to request flexibleworking – all of which have aimed toreduce inequalities within the labourmarket.But is the Commission right toconclude that action is now needed beforewomen enter the labour market? Theevidence of my research suggests weshould be sceptical.The gender pay gap amongyoung workersFigure 1’s depiction of how the gender paygap changes over the lifecycle does notsuggest that the biggest problem is onlabour market entry as the gap is very smallamong young workers. The Commission isright that there is occupational segregationeven among young workers – the jobsdone by young men and women are verydifferent. But the fact that there is only asmall pay gap at this time suggests thatwomen are not choosing occupations thatput them at a big immediate disadvantage. As an indication of the magnitudesinvolved, consider university graduates.Men and women continue to study verydifferent subjects at university and this isreflected in their occupations when theygraduate and enter the labour market. Ongraduation, there is currently a smallgender pay gap of about 2.5%, all ofwhich can be explained by the differentsubjects men and women study. Soeliminating this gender difference might beexpected to reduce the gender pay gap by2.5%. But when the gender pay gap is25% by the age of 35, this is a non-trivialbut small amount. From this, one might be inclined todismiss the Commission’s argument that weneed to pay more attention to whathappens prior to labour market entry. Butperhaps things are more subtle than that;perhaps women are choosing occupationsthat offer relatively good wages initially butlittle prospect for wage growth. Theevidence here is less clear. There is someevidence that the subjects studied bywomen offer lower wage growth thanthose studied by men but again, thecontribution of this seems to be quite small.One might also argue that policyshould not necessarily be directed wherethe problems are greatest but where thepolicy will have the most effect. But manyof the Commission’s proposals are forpolicies about whose effectiveness we haveabsolutely no evidence. In some cases, weprobably never will.For example, one recommendation is topercentage points higher than that ofwomen. The reason is that most womenstill take some time out of paidemployment when they have children.The Women and WorkCommissionThese facts are the backdrop to theWomen and Work Commission,established in 2004 to address the causesof the gender pay gap and recommendwhat to do about it. The Commission’sreport, published in February 2006,presented what it described as ‘a radicalprogramme to end decades of jobs andpay unfairness for women’. It concludedthat women are not making full use oftheir skills and the primary cause is theculture of schools and workplaces.The report makes 40 detailedsuggestions for tackling the problem. Verycrudely, these proposals are of two kinds:■ Policies for before (or very soon after)labour market entry, including reducinggender stereotyping in schools andencouraging women to study male-dominated subjects and undertakevocational training in male-dominatedoccupations. The intended aim here is toreduce occupational segregation amongyoung men and women entering thelabour market.■ Policies for after labour market entry,including making more senior jobs-20%15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55-10%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%■ Born 1975-84■ Born 1965-74■ Born 1955-64■ Born 1945-54Figure 2:The gender gap in employment and the lifecycle for different birth cohortsGender gap in employmentAgeThe current generation of working women is doing only slightly betterrelative to men than theprevious generationthey are continuing to choose family overcareer at some point in their life.What’s more, when they return to thelabour market, they often work part-time.Our labour market severely punishes thosewho at any point in their lives sacrificecareer for family. So people returning to part-time work often do so in lower-status jobs than they had previously. Veryfew high-level jobs are done on a part-timebasis.The Women and Work Commission isright to recommend that more should bedone to open up high-level jobs to flexibleworking arrangements. But it is not veryspecific about what should be done.For example, my research with BarbaraPetrongolo finds little evidence that the rightto request flexible working has had anyimpact on the incidence of the whole rangeof flexible working practices. It is likely thatpeople will always pay some price for takingperiods out of paid employment asexperience is valuable to employers. But theprice currently paid by women who takecareer breaks does seem to bedisproportionate.Why women don’t ‘get on’ inthe labour marketWhile career breaks clearly have an impact,my research with Joanna Swaffield finds thatmost of the gender gap in wage growthamong young workers cannot be explainedby differences in labour market attachment.For example, we estimate that a womanwho has worked full-time ever since leavingfull-time education can still expect to bepaid 12% less than an equivalent man after10 years. For some reason, women arefailing to ‘get on’.One way of seeing this is in the evidencethat women are much less likely to becomemanagers. Figure 4 shows the percentage ofmen and women of different ages who arein managerial occupations. A gap begins toopen up when people are in their mid-twenties but then widens very dramaticallyafter the late twenties. This is what iscommonly understood as the ‘glass ceiling’.Why do women fail to ‘get on’ in thelabour market? Some recent research train early years childcare workers to ensurethat 3-5 year olds do not have theirhorizons limited by gender stereotyping. Ifimplemented, this could only have an effect20 years down the line. Even then, wewould probably be unable to see its effectvery directly.There have clearly been huge changesin attitudes about the role of women andmen in society in the last 50 years. Butgovernment has primarily reflected notinitiated these changes. It may be thatpolicies like teaching maths and science togirls in single-sex classes is effective, but Idoubt if the gender pay gap will fall bymuch as a result. The gender pay gap afterlabour market entry The evidence in Figure 1 shows that thegender pay gap is small on labour marketentry but then widens quite rapidly. Thissuggests that what happens in the labourmarket is much more important than whathappens before entry. That is why myresearch with Joanna Swaffield tried tounderstand gender differences in wagegrowth among young workers. Thiswidening gap after entry is true whetherone looks at the pay gap or some othermeasures of differences between men and women. For example, Figure 3 shows howoccupational segregation evolves over thelifecycle. The measure of occupationalsegregation here is the Duncan DissimilarityIndex, which calculates the fraction of menand women that would have to changejobs for the proportion of women to bethe same in all jobs. Clearly, there isoccupational segregation on labour marketentry as emphasised by the Commission.But occupational segregation also growsvery sharply until the age of 35. So an awful lot is happening afterlabour market entry – what are the reasonsfor this divergence? Joanna Swaffield and Iconclude that approximately half of therise in the gender pay gap is the result ofdifferences in the labour marketattachment of women (indicated in Figure2) and differences in the receipt oftraining. The main cause of this is that manywomen continue to take breaks from paidemployment when they have children. Theproblem is not that women are choosingone career – such as hairdressing – ratherthan another – such as plumbing. It is thatCentrePiece Summer 2006150.300.350.400.450.500.550.6015 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55Figure 3:Occupational segregation and the lifecycleDuncan Dissimilarity IndexAgeThe gender pay gap is small when womenenter the labourmarket but thenwidens quite rapidly(see Babcock and Laschever) suggests thatsystematic differences in personality areresponsible – for example, that women areintrinsically less competitive than men, tendto be less self-confident and less effective innegotiation. This might be because ofintrinsic differences between men andwomen or because of gender stereotypingwithin the education system.Joanna Swaffield and I find that thishas little explanatory power. It is true thatadolescent women have less self-confidence than men and that the self-confident do significantly better in thelabour market in later life. But the effects we uncover are simply too small tobe an explanation.There is still considerable mysterysurrounding why women do not make asmuch progress as men in the labourmarket. And without a clear understandingof the reasons, it is hard to makerecommendations on policy.Equal pay auditsAs we need to know a lot more about whythe gender gap persists, one policy idea isto try to force information out into theopen through the use of equal pay audits.It is quite likely that without any consciouspolicy, the promotion decisions in millionsof companies add up to a big disadvantagefor women.Employers are very often shocked todiscover the size of this disadvantage asthey think of their policies as non-discriminatory. If statistics were publishedon the position of women within firms, thiswould bring the position out into the openand we would expect women themselvesto gravitate to firms where they appear todo better.Should such a scheme be compulsoryor voluntary? Employers do not have afantastic track record in supporting equalpay measures that few would now oppose:many predecessors of today’s executivesjustified the marriage bar and opposed theEqual Pay Act as being ‘bad for business’.But compulsion is perhaps too far: if weset up a scheme that encourages employersto publish statistics on the position ofwomen in their organisation and perhapsgives a stamp of approval to those who dowell, then people can draw their ownconclusions about the firms that choose notto publish such information.ConclusionThere is much that is sensible in therecommendations of the Women and WorkCommission’s report. But I am a littlesceptical about how effective theirrecommendations are likely to be for thesimple reason that it is now not so easy toidentify the remaining causes of the genderpay gap.And I have one concern that theCommission may make things worse. Thedominant impression from the report is thatwomen are not making full use of theirskills and this is bad for the economy as awhole. In phrasing things in these terms,there is a danger of setting ‘market work’up as the ideal, reinforcing our culture thatsays that rewards should godisproportionately to those who work hard,a culture that continues to be to theadvantage of men rather than women.Every time I sit in my garden enjoyingthe sunshine and ‘doing nothing’, I am notmaking full use of my skills and ‘UK plc’suffers as a result. But I choose to do thisbecause that is what I prefer. In makingthat decision, I am probably making a smallsacrifice in career terms, but career is noteverything.Perhaps the biggest culture change weneed is not in the attitudes and aspirationsof women but those of men. It is notmore women truck drivers that we needbut more male homemakers. On theproblem of men, the Women and WorkCommission is largely silent.Alan Manning is professor of economics atLSE and director of CEP’s researchprogramme on labour markets.Further readingLinda Babcock and Sara Laschever (2003),Women Don’t Ask: Negotiation and theGender Divide, Princeton University Press.Alan Manning and Barbara Petrongolo (2005),‘The Part-time Pay Penalty’, CEP DiscussionPaper No. 679(http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0679.pdf).Alan Manning and Joanna Swaffield (2005),‘The Gender Gap in Early Career WageGrowth’, CEP Discussion Paper No. 700(http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0700.pdf).The Women and Work Commission (2006),Shaping a Fairer Future(http://www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk/women_work_commission/).0%5%10%15%20%25%WomenMen15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55■ Men■ WomenFigure 4:Percentage of managers and the lifecyclePercentage of workforce in managerial occupationsAgeCentrePiece Summer 200616Since December 2003, UKlaw has protected lesbian,gay and bisexual workersfrom discrimination andharassment at theworkplace, giving themthe same employment rights as women,disabled and ethnic minority staff. Ourresearch contributes to the small butgrowing literature on the economics ofdiscrimination according to sexualorientation by presenting the firstassessment of the impact of thislegislation.As yet, economists are uncertain howreadily their models of discrimination bygender and ethnic origin apply todiscrimination by sexual orientation. Aswith religion or political affiliation, firmsmay not directly observe the sexuality ofworkers. And both the type and extent ofany discrimination by sexual orientationmay be different from discrimination bygender or ethnic origin.The likelihood of an employer, co-worker or customer discriminating againsta gay person could also vary withcharacteristics such as age, education andthe nature and location of the workplace.Equal opportunity policies, for example,were typically adopted earlier in the UK’spublic sector than in the private sector,allowing the possibility of differentialGay pay in the UKHas recent anti-discrimination legislation madea difference to the pay and employmentprospects of gay men and lesbian women in theUK? Reza Arabsheibani, Alan Marin andJonathan Wadsworth investigate.CentrePiece Summer 200617Gay men in couples earn6% less than comparableheterosexual men and areless likely to be in workCentrePiece Summer 200618The raw data show that gay couplesare typically younger, more educated andmore likely to live in London thanheterosexual couples. But we can controlfor any differences in pay and employmentthat may be caused by such differences inage, education, race and health as well asdifferences in regional settlement patterns,occupation or industrial affiliation. If, forexample, lesbian and gay individuals makedifferent investments in career paths, thenwe need to account for such differencesthat could otherwise show up asdifferential wage or employment rates.To test whether the anti-discriminationlaw had a discernable impact on the payand employment of homosexual couples,we simply compare the change in theiremployment and pay levels relative toheterosexual couples over the periodbefore and after the legislation.Heterosexual couples will not have beendirectly affected by this law and so theirpay and employment changes over thisperiod can serve as benchmarks. Bycomparing changes for same sex couplesagainst these benchmarks, we candetermine whether or not the legislationhad any effect.Table 1 shows the percentagedifferences in hourly pay betweenhomosexual and heterosexual couples.Gay men living in a couple earn, onaverage, around 1% less thanheterosexual men in a couple, notaccounting for any differences ineffects across the two sectors. And lesbian and gay individuals may locate inparts of the country that are perceived tobe more tolerant. The size of the homosexual populationrelative to the number of non-discriminatory employers could also havean effect on wage and employment rates.The smaller the size of the minority group,the easier it may be to find non-discriminatory employers, though a smallerminority group may find it harder to havean effective voice.We can start to explore these issues bymeasuring the extent of differences in payand employment across different groups.This goal is immediately confronted by theshortage of data on sexual orientation.Fortunately the Labour Force Survey has, since 1996, collected information onthe subset of homosexual individuals wholive together.The survey categorises peopleaccording to whether they are marriedand living with their spouse. Those whodo not belong to this group are thenasked whether they are living withsomeone as a couple and, if so, whetherthey are in a same sex couple. These samesex couples comprise just 0.2% of theadult working age population.This method of identifying thehomosexual population is not perfect as itdoes not include those who are marriedand living with an opposite sex partner orthose who do not live with a partner,whether they have one or not. Moreover,it does not include those who live with asame sex partner but do not reveal it inthe survey. There is also no information todistinguish between gays, bisexuals orother sexual minority groups.Although these exclusions may biasthe applicability of our results to the entiregay population, by comparing the samplepopulation to an appropriate samplegroup of non-gays, we can reduce any‘composition bias’. For this reason, wecompare the labour market outcomes ofhomosexuals in our sample with the set ofheterosexual couples, both married andunmarried, living together betweenJanuary 2001 and August 2005.This gives us 35 months ofobservations before the law came in and21 months after, periods that are not toolong to be affected by other changes andnot too short to prevent any relevantchanges showing up.Table 1:Pay and employment of individuals in homosexual couples bypersonal, location and job characteristicsMenSame sex relative to heterosexual before anti-discrimination legislation-1 -6 -5 -8 -7 +3 -3 -2 -4 -3Change in gap after law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0WomenSame sex relative to heterosexual before anti-discrimination legislation+35 +11 +14 +9 +6 +15 +12 +13 +12 +12Change in gap after law 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0No controlsControls Non-graduateAged 40 or youngerEmployedin theprivate sectorNo controlsControls Non-graduateAged 40 or youngerOutsideLondonHourly wage gaps (percentage) Employment gaps (percentage points)Lesbian women incouples are paid 11%more than comparableheterosexual women andare considerably morelikely to be in workCentrePiece Summer 200619characteristics.

Wethen check to see how robust thesedifferentials are to the addition ofcontrols for observable differencesbetween the gay and heterosexualgroups in a set of variables also known toinfluence wage levels.For example, since there are moregraduates among lesbian women thanamong heterosexual women, this couldhelp explain why there appears to be alarge pay premium for women in a same sex couple. Part of the estimated‘gay effect’ would be picking up the‘graduate effect’.As Table 1 shows, adding controls forage, education, region, occupation andindustry shows that the positive paypremium for lesbian women is muchreduced but still positive at 11%. Butthere is still little change in the periodafter the legislation. For gay men,controlling for differences in characteristicsmakes the negative pay penalty larger ataround 6%. So for the same observedcharacteristics, gay men appear to be paidless than their heterosexual peers.Since the legislation may have helpeddisadvantaged groups of homosexualworkers more, we split the data intogroups that could be more at risk ofdiscrimination, namely non-graduates,younger workers and those working in theprivate sector. This shows that the paygaps for non-graduates are similar to thetotal figure, but the pay penalty foryounger gay men is larger and the paypremium for younger lesbian women andthose working in the private sector is muchlower. But there are still no changes in thepay differentials after the law came in.Since discrimination can be manifestedin hiring rates as well as wages, it may bethat there are differences in employmentrates for the homosexual couples ordifferent sub-groups. It is possible that theresults for wage rates are, in part,influenced by ‘selectivity’ – differentialemployment probabilities mean theunobserved characteristics of those inwork could differ between thehomosexual and heterosexual couples. The raw employment rate differentialsin Table 1 suggest that gay men andlesbian women are more likely to be inwork than heterosexual couples. Butcontrolling for differences in characteristicssuggests that gay men are less likely to bein employment than heterosexual men,and that the employment premium forwomen is reduced substantially. There israther less heterogeneity in the same sexemployment gaps across different sub-groups than there is in pay. But onceagain, we find no discernable changes inany of these gaps after the anti-discrimination legislation. So more than two years after theintroduction of anti-discriminationlegislation, gay men appear to be paid around 6% less than theirheterosexual counterparts with similarobserved characteristics and are threepercentage points less likely to be inwork. Lesbian women, however, appearto be paid around 11% more thanheterosexual women living in a coupleand are 12 percentage points more likelyto be in work.Differentials of this magnitude couldbe observed before the legislation tookhold and it is hard to conclude that thelegislation has had much effect on theseoutcomes, though it may of course haveother effects in the workplace.The average pay differentials doconceal much variation across age groups,education, regions and sectors of theeconomy. Whether these differentialsreflect different discriminatory practices indifferent regions, in different sectors oracross different sub-groups within theminority population is a moot point,though again it is hard to discern adifferential effect of anti-discriminationlegislation across these groups.This article summarises ‘Variations in GayPay in the UK and USA’ by RezaArabsheibani, Alan Marin and JonathanWadsworth, forthcoming in SexualOrientation Discrimination: An InternationalPerspective edited by Lee Badgett and JeffFrank (Routledge).

Our study uses an innovative survey tool on over 700manufacturing firms in France, Germany, the UK and theUnited States to ask questions about managementpractices and work-life balance. We find that: ■ Well-managed firms do not work ‘harder’ but ‘smarter’– employees in well-run firms typically have a betterwork-life balance.■ In particular, management practices associated withgood ‘people management’ – such as fostering talent,rewarding and retaining well performing staff andproviding consistent training opportunities – are likelyto work in conjunction with good work-life balancepractices – family-friendly policies, flexible working,shorter hours, more holidays, childcare subsidies, etc.■ In well-managed firms, the hours worked by bothmanagerial and non-managerial staff are notsignificantly higher than those in badly run firms. Thisagain confirms the finding that working smarter notharder is the key determinant to successfulmanagement.■ The share of women in management relative to non-management is significantly higher in firms with betterwork-life balance. In other words, the ‘glass ceiling’does not seem to exist nearly as strongly in firms thattreat their employees well.We describe two opposing views on the effects andefficacy of good management practices on work-lifebalance – the pessimistic ‘trade-off’ view and theoptimistic ‘win-win’ view:■ The trade-off view is that ‘Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism’,encapsulated by tougher product market competitionand globalisation has undesirable consequences.Although these forces raise productivity, they come atthe expense of misery for workers in the form of longhours, job insecurity and intense and unsatisfyingwork.■ The win-win view argues that better work-life balancewill improve productivity and employers are mistakenlyfailing to treat their workers as assets and implementbetter work-life balance practices.This study finds evidence for a hybrid view between thesetwo polar extremes (see Figure 1 and Table 1):■ The evidence does not support the trade-off view:there is, in fact, a positive association between goodmanagement and work-life balance. Similarly, the viewthat competition and globalisation are bad for work-life balance is not supported: there is no relationshipWork-life balance:the links with managementpractices and productivityin brief...Employees in larger, more globalisedfirms seem to be much better off in terms of their working livesDoes good management and higherproductivity come at the expense ofwork-life balance? Or is good work-lifebalance an important component of themanagement of successful firms? Newresearch by Nick Bloom, TobiasKretschmer and John Van Reenenfinds evidence for a hybrid viewbetween these two polar extremes.CentrePiece Summer 200621between tougher competition and work-life balance.And larger firms – which are typically more globalised –also have better work-life balance practices.■ But the win-win view that better work-life balance willimprove productivity is also rejected: there is norelationship between productivity and work-life balanceonce good management is accounted for.■ Instead, well-managed firms can choose to introducebetter work-life balance practices or not. If they do introduce them, this neither penalises themin terms of productivity nor does it significantly reward them.Based on these results, it simply is not true thatglobalisation is such a disaster for employees. Employeesin larger, more globalised firms seem to be much betteroff in terms of their working lives than those in smaller,more national firms.This conclusion suggests that improving work-life balanceis socially desirable – workers obviously like it and firmproductivity does not suffer. For firms, this will be worthweighing up more seriously. Most of the best-run firms inour sample treated their employees very well.But we also need to be cautious before inferring that theresults give a carte blanche for governments to regulatefor better work-life balance. Good work-life balanceseems to be something that well-run firms in competitivemarkets do naturally. They need to treat their employeeswell to keep them – if not, their competitors will hirethem away. Government policies on work-life balanceshould take this into account.This article summarises ‘Work-Life Balance,Management Practices and Productivity’ by Nick Bloom,Tobias Kretschmer and John Van Reenen(http://cep.lse.ac.uk/management/worklifebalance_research.pdf).Nick Bloom is assistant professor of economics at StanfordUniversity and director of CEP’s research programme onproductivity and innovation.

Oneimagines, perhaps rightly, that these children arecondemned to a lifetime of poverty because of their lackof access to education and the permanent scars fromworking at an early age. Because of this, many peoplewould advocate policies banning child labour andestablishing compulsory school attendance.Economists are rather more cautious about suchconclusions. Yes, child labour is obviously bad but what isthe alternative for these children? If they were forced toattend school rather than going to work, would they ortheir families be unequivocally better off?Some amount of child labour might allow a child or hissiblings to afford an education or satisfy basic feedingneeds, in which case a ban on child labour would notnecessarily be desirable. Perhaps instead, it is parents whomight work more to sustain their children in school, whichwould provide some justification for public policyintervention.My research explores these issues, in particular analysingthe impact of working children on their parents’ work andtheir siblings’ work and education. Assessing empirically how parents and siblings respond toa child working is easier said than done. Both parents andsiblings from poorer families will presumably be morelikely to work. Hence, one will find a positive correlationbetween parents' and children's labour, which would behard to interpret as the ‘causal effect’ of child labour onhousehold labour supply. The solution devised in this paper is to look at the impactof child labour laws in 1920 urban America. What makesthis worth studying is that the minimum working agevaried across US states: some states imposed an age aslow as 12 while others prevented children younger than16 from working. This provides the opportunity for a‘natural experiment’.My research shows that the laws had an impact. Analysisof data from the 1920 US census shows that a childsufficiently old to work in his state of residence tended towork more than a child of the same age living in adifferent state where he was not allowed to work.To check that this difference does not reflect unobserveddifferences across states in children's work opportunitiesor their need to work – both of which might in turnexplain a lower legal working age – I compare thisdifference to the difference in participation between a pairof younger children living in the two states who are bothnot allowed to work. I then compare the difference in employment of theparents of the first pair of children relative to thedifference in the second pair. I attribute this ‘difference indifference’ in participation to the effect of the differentialeligibility for work of these adults' children. Using thisstrategy, I find no statistically significant evidence ofparents working less in response to their children enteringthe labour market.To infer the effect of child labour on siblings' work andschool participation, I use a slightly different strategy. Theidea here is to compare the effect of a child being eligiblefor work on both his own probability of work and theprobability of work of a child chosen at random from hishousehold (the child himself or one of his siblings). If thesecond effect is smaller, it implies that when a child worksin brief...When poor children are working rather than going to school, dotheir parents work less? And what happens to their siblings?Marco Manacorda looks for answers in the experience of childlabour in urban America at the dawn of the jazz age.It seems to be extreme povertyrather than parental exploitationthat lies behind child labourCentrePiece Summer 200623more, his siblings respond by working less. Indeed, this iswhat happened: the response to a child becoming eligiblefor work was for his siblings to work less and be morelikely to attend school.What do we learn from this analysis? Parents do notappear to adjust their work effort in response to theirchildren's change in labour market participation. This isconsistent with the notion that parents of workingchildren cannot possibly work more than they actually do.If one accepts this interpretation, it seems to be extremepoverty rather than parental exploitation that lies behindchild labour.A second and potentially more novel result is that thesiblings of working children appear to benefit from onechild in the household working in terms of increasedschool attendance and reduced labour. This raisesconcerns about the distribution of work and school acrosschildren within the same households: it appears that thecosts of sending some children to school in poor familiesare borne in part by their working siblings.This article summarises ‘Child Labour andthe Labour Supply of Other HouseholdMembers: Evidence from 1920 America’ by Marco Manacorda, CEP Discussion Paper No. 590(http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0590.pdf) and forthcoming in the AmericanEconomic Review.Marco Manacorda is at Queen Mary,University of London and a researchassociate in CEP’s labour marketsprogramme.Image: Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, National Child Labor Committee Collection,[reproduction number, LC-DIG-nclc-00744]The costs of sending some children to school in poor families are borne in part by their working siblingsCentrePiece Summer 200624to negotiate collective contracts and to be involved in the detail of paymentsystems. By contrast, the unions in ourthree cases played, at best, a peripheralrole in such matters.Chinese labour law now encouragesunions to sign and perhaps bargaincollectively to negotiate collectivecontracts. Both Pig Farm and CoconutPalm said that they do have such collectivecontracts but not as a result of negotiationwith the grass roots union branch. Rather,the contracts set out the minimumstandards in matters like minimum wages,working time and safety as required bynational and local law. Such collectivecontracts were referred to derisorily bymanagement at Coconut Palm as simplysetting out ‘themes’ but having no realcontent. Tinplate simply dismissed thenotion of collective contracts.Instead, all three companiesemphasised the importance of individualcontracts. Pig Farm uses the modelindividual contract issued by the labourbureau in Haikou City (the capital ofHainan Province) but with its ownamendments. This contract is re-signedevery five years. At Tinplate, the individualcontract is for one year. We were told thatthis short duration is a deliberate stick toelicit effort: ‘we could provide three- orTrade unions in Chinahave many members:137 million according tothe official figure fromthe All China Federationof Trade Unions (ACFTU)as indicated in Figure 1. But they arevirtually impotent when it comes torepresenting workers.Because the Chinese party-staterecognises that such frailty may lead toinstability, it has passed labour lawspromoting collective contracts andestablished tripartite institutions tomediate in individual disputes. But whilethese new laws and institutions arewelcome, they are largely hollow.Collective contracts are very different from collective bargaining and theincidence of cases dealt with by tripartiteinstitutions is tiny.Although China does not haveproperly functioning unions, it is worthremembering that the whole notion of a‘labour market’ is only a decade or so old,reflecting the previous Marxist aversion toexchanging labour for money.Since the 1994 Labour Law, whichintroduced labour contracts, the labourmarket has become firmly established inChina. But there is no evidencewhatsoever of a parallel development infunctioning unions. The inability ofworkers to develop proper representationfor their common interests, coupled withthe rapid spread and deepening of themarket mechanisms, implies that despitetheir huge membership, unions are likelyto remain largely nugatory in Chineselabour relations. In detailed case studies conducted in2004 and 2005, we looked at threecompanies in Hainan Province: a jointventure producing tinplate; the largestcoconut juice producer in the world; and alisted pig farm conglomerate. In all threecompanies, unions are a sideshow in termsof ‘voice’ and dispute resolution. AtTinplate, for example, voice arrangementsare entirely via frequent direct meetingsbetween management and workers, andthe union chair is the top sales manager.We were told the union ‘is only forshow… irrelevant… just organises sportand entertainment… will soon fade away’.At Coconut Palm, which is employee-owned, it is the shareholders committeethat filters management decisions. Theseare then validated by the workerscongress, a sort of works council and ahangover from when the company wasstate-owned. The union ‘just plays awelfare role’.In the West, a major role for unions isChina apparently has more trade unionmembers than the rest of the world puttogether. But as David Metcalf and Jianwei Lihave found, Chinese unions function verydifferently from unions in the West.Trade unions in hina CentrePiece Summer 200625two-year contracts but the one-yearcontract yields more discipline’.The reason that individual contractsare paramount is not hard to find. Allthree companies have powerful versions ofperformance-related pay. Our evidencemirrors the remarkable change from thetraditional system of an egalitarian, non-performance related pay systemtowards company, team and individualperformance pay with a low basecomponent. In the three companies, thesesystems were devised and implemented bymanagement with no real input fromunions or workers.Pig Farm sets team-level productiontargets with severe penalties for missingthe target and generous rewards forexceeding it. Tinplate has a company-wideperformance-based system such that, onaverage, production workers’ pay iscomposed of a base amount of 40% andan output-related amount of 60%. Moreimportantly, there is an ‘inversetournament’: each worker is given arigorous annual performance appraisal andthe worker with the lowest rating isautomatically dismissed.At Coconut Palm, the performancepay system uses salary, bonus, dividendsand fines. Quality control is achieved byteams monitoring the output quality ofthe previous team on the assembly line. A defective can would, for example, resultin a fine of more than one day’s pay.Managers and union officials emphasisedthat when this system was introduced inthe 1990s, many workers left becausethey could not cope with the risk sharingand extra effort required.In her stunning family history WildSwans, Jung Chan notes that during thefamine (1959-61), ‘telling fantasies tooneself as well as others, and believingthem, was practised to an incredibledegree… “self-deception while deceivingothers” gripped the nation’. If we turn theclock forward almost half a century,unions inhabit a similar dream world.The plain fact is that Chinese unionsare feeble. Thriving unions need, initially atleast, some common interest amongworkers to flower. This has not developed,and is unlikely to evolve for a number ofreasons:■ First, the basic union unit is theworkplace or enterprise, which makes itdifficult to develop the rallying cry ofFigure 1:Employment, union membership and union density in China, 2004Employment (millions)Total 752Urban 265Rural 487Unions (millions)Number of members 137.00Number of grass roots union branches 1.02DensityMembership as percentage of: Total employment 18.2%Urban employment 51.7%Chinese unions have manymembers but are virtuallyimpotent when it comes to representing workersCentrePiece Summer 200626western unions for much of the latenineteenth and twentieth century – ‘therate for the job’ or ‘common rule’.■ Second, the party-state does not recognise any conflict betweencapital and labour.■ Third, even if class consciousness isenhanced – by, for example, thedreadful and worsening safety record (in2002, workplace accidents caused140,000 deaths and 250,000 workerslost body parts and suffered otherinjuries), growing wage and incomeinequality and the exploitation ofworkers, particularly by foreign-investedfirms – any manifestations of commoninterests are likely to be suppressed bythe party-state.■ Fourth, even the ACFTU’s top officialsconsider the members to be entirelyseparate from ‘the union’. ACFTUchairman Wang Zhaoguo has said thatChinese unions must ‘forge closer linkswith workers’ and ‘consistently keepclose ties with the masses of workers asthe lifeline of trade union work’. Suchstatements confirm that members’interests are presently a low priority. Furthermore, the spread of the marketmechanism to product and labour marketsmeans that, whatever the law says, manyfirms do not wish to treat with unions.Under the market system, unions canthrive either if they can impose costs onthe employer or if they can demonstrablyprovide benefits by boosting the efficiencyof the enterprise. Unions are incapable ofimposing costs and all the evidencesuggests that managers in the growingnon-state-owned segment of the economybelieve that the efficiency of the enterprisedepends on their actions, utterlyindependent of any unions’ role.Thus, collective contracts and tripartiteinstitutions are treated with a shrug of theshoulders – implemented because it is thelaw but not embraced. And all the whileemployees have a low priority. A 2004survey of over 3,000 private sectorenterprises asked: ‘If you want to be agood employer in the private sector, whichkind of good things would you like todo?’ There were six items and theemployer could answer ‘yes’ to as many ass/he liked. Only 29% said ‘yes’ to ‘treatingworkers well’.Unions will remain nugatory whilethey rest content as a transmission beltThis article summarises ‘Chinese Unions:Nugatory or Transforming? An Alice Analysis’by David Metcalf and Jianwei Li, CEPDiscussion Paper No. 708(http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp0708.pdf) and forthcoming in Advances in Industrial and Labor Relations.David Metcalf is professor of industrialrelations at LSE and a research associate inCEP’s labour markets programme.Jianwei Li is a member of the Haikou Cityforeign affairs ministry and was a CEPresearch assistant 2003/4.ManyChinesecompaniesnow usepowerfulversions ofperformance-related paysuch that they convey government policiesto workers and enforce labour discipline topromote those policies, as opposed torepresenting workers in dealing withemployers and the government.Real wages have trebled in China inthe last 20 years. But collective action byunions is utterly irrelevant to this hugeadvance in workers’ well-being, whichsimply mirrors the very rapid growth ofproductivity. On the other hand,representation, voice, greater safety and atempering of exploitation surely do requireboth collective action and autonomousorganisation.If the Chinese government wants theunions to provide an effective safety valve,then it has to allow them a degree ofindependence and permit, if notencourage, them to play a representativerole. But the 2003 ACFTU Congressmarked a major setback for progressiveunion developments, with the installationof a more conservative leadership.The need for more effective collectiverepresentation is recognised by far-seeingalbeit cautious ACFTU officials. Their 2004report for the World Bank concluded withwhat is, in effect, a manifesto for reform,including the need to help workersdevelop their collective interests becauseunions are ‘the weakest ring’ in thelabour market; autonomous negotiationsand the right to strike; and a muchstronger labour inspectorate, to coversocial security payments, labour contractsand collective agreements (though notsafety). But such reasonable reforms doseem a long way off.CentrePiece Summer 200627Cycles of disadvantageThe fact that roughly 3.4 million children – or 27% of the child population – are living in poverty is a criticalpolicy issue. Much has been made of the government’scommitment to reducing child poverty, particularly its first target of a 25% fall in the numbers in povertybetween 1998/99 and 2004/05, which has just beennarrowly missed.This concern about child poverty relates not just to theimmediate effects of poverty. More importantly, theexperience of poverty in childhood may influence social,economic and health outcomes throughout later life,leading to the ‘persistence’ of poverty into adulthood andconsequences for the next generation.In order to investigate the long-term impact of growingup in poverty, we need to observe children’s familycircumstances and then return to see how they are doinglater in life. Such information can be found in the twoBritish cohort studies: the National Child DevelopmentStudy and the British Cohort Study. The availability ofthese two data sources – one a cohort born in 1958, theother a cohort born in 1970 – allows us to compare thefortunes of people who were teenagers in the 1970s andthe 1980s.Our initial estimates of the persistence of povertycompare the poverty rates of people in their early thirtiesbetween those who grew up in poverty and those whodid not:■ Of people whose families were poor when they were16 in the 1970s, 19% were poor in their early thirtiesand 81% were not. So the ‘odds’ against growing up to be poor if your parents were poor were overfour-to-one.■ Of people whose families were not poor when theywere 16 in the 1970s, 90% were not poor in theirearly thirties while 10% were poor. So the ‘odds’against growing up to be poor if your parents were notpoor were about nine-to-one.Persistence of poverty can be measured by dividing theodds of being poor if one's parents were poor by theodds of being poor if they were not – a number calledthe ‘odds ratio’.Calculations of this odds ratio show that for a teenager inthe 1970s, the odds of being poor as an adult weredoubled if his or her parents were poor. Similarcalculations for the later cohort who were teenagers inthe 1980s show that the odds of being poor inadulthood were nearly quadrupled by having poorparents (see Figure 1). Comparing these odds across thecohorts indicates that the strength of poverty persistencehas approximately doubled, with an increase for men thatis slightly greater than for women. For teenagers growing up in the 1970s, teenage povertydoubled the odds of being poor at age 33. For this oldercohort, it is also possible to observe their situations at age42. The impact of teenage poverty on poverty at age 42is very similar to its impact at age 33, also doubling thechances of being poor. For this group, teenage poverty istherefore as strongly related to middle-age poverty as topoverty in earlier adulthood.This is perhaps surprising: we might expect the influenceof teenage poverty to fade as the years go by. Oneexplanation could be that teenage poverty influencespoverty in early adulthood, and this then links through topoverty in later life. But accounting for poverty at age 33has very little impact on the odds ratios for poverty atage 42. The link between poverty in teenhood andadulthood continues through to middle age, regardless ofwhether or not an individual is recorded as poor in theirthirties. These results raise an important policy question: what is itabout growing up in poverty that makes it more likelythat poor children will experience disadvantage in laterlife? This is crucial in terms of putting in place effectivepolicies to alleviate the effects of early disadvantage. Forexample, if we can show that it is lack of money in itselfGrowing up in poverty makes it more likely thatchildren will be poor in later lifein brief...More than a quarter of Britain’s children are growing up in poverty.New research by Jo Blanden and Steve Gibbons measures the extent towhich children’s experience of relative financial hardship increases theirchances of being poor in adulthood – and whether that ‘persistence’ ofpoverty across generations has got worse.CentrePiece Summer 200628that is causing children to do badly, then redistribution isan obvious solution and reducing child poverty throughbenefits will have important effects.We know that poor families differ in many ways fromthose who are not poor: they are more likely to be headedby lone parents and/or parents with low education andemployment. Policy prescriptions are more difficult if it isthese factors that lead to disadvantageous outcomes forchildren, as they are much less subject to change. Thecohort studies include information on family characteristics,which makes it possible to measure the extent to whichthey are connected with poverty in later life:■ For the teenagers growing up in the 1970s, it seemsthat the impact of these factors on children can explainall of the higher later poverty rates for children whoexperienced poverty as teenagers. It was their familycharacteristics, in particular their parents’ lack ofeducation and work, that resulted in their later povertyand not the fact that their parents lacked income per se.■ For those who were teenagers in the 1980s, this is notthe case: even when taking account of their familycharacteristics, there is evidence that poverty in itselfputs these young people at a significant disadvantage. These results could be taken to imply that straightforwardredistribution would have had substantial benefits for theyounger group. But this conclusion is too simplistic as itdoes not take account of the ways in which poor andnon-poor families differ that are difficult to observe. For example, we do not have a measure of parents’ability to help and encourage their children to learn andpersevere. Evidence from other studies suggests thatpolicies to reduce child poverty through transfers must becoupled with policies that help children’s learning anddevelopment, particularly at early ages. The most striking finding from this research is that thepersistence of poverty from the teens into the earlythirties has risen over time, with teenage poverty havinga greater impact on later outcomes for teenagers in the1980s compared with teenagers in the 1970s. Thisfinding adds to the wider evidence that familybackground has had a growing impact on later outcomesbetween these cohorts.
