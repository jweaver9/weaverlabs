A significant part of this work has been to document the experiences of students, as well as to examine teacher beliefs and practices that can influence school climate. In 2005, GLSEN released From Teasing to Torment: School Climate in America, A Survey of Students and Teachers. Findings from From Teasing to Torment reinforced our awareness that bullying and harassment, especially those incidents which are based on bias and personal characteristics, are major challenges confronting all schools. Yet 10 years later, we believe bias-based bullying and harassment remain a significant concern of students, families, and schools all across the country. Furthermore, despite legal and cultural changes, we see that LGBTQ students continue to face hostile school climates, although there have been small, gradual improvements.1 However, there has been limited research that assesses how the school climate may have changed over the past decade for the general population of students in regards to bias, bullying,2 and LGBTQ issues. Furthermore, there is little information about the general population of teachers’ beliefs and practices as related to bias, bullying, or LGBTQ issues, and no information about how these beliefs and practices may have shifted over time. For these reasons, we felt it was important to reexamine the issues we explored in the 2005 From Teasing to Torment report by conducting a similar survey in 2015, exactly a decade after the initial report.From Teasing to Torment: School Climate Revisited, A Survey of U.S. Secondary School Students and Teachers affords us the opportunity to document the current state of safety, bias, and bullying in schools and assess potential disparities based not only on LGBTQ status, but also on race/ethnicity, sex, gender expression, and socioeconomic status. As school climate is determined not only by the existence or absence of victimization, we also explore students’ experiences with school disciplinary actions and extracurricular activities, seeking to develop a more complete picture of the student experience. In addition, we again document students’ access to resources that may improve school climate, such as student clubs that address LGBTQ student issues, inclusive curriculum, and anti-bullying/harassment policies. Moreover, in this report, secondary school teachers offer their perceptions on bias, bullying, and LGBTQ students’ safety, and provide valuable information about the preparation they may have received to address these issues. We also document teachers’ practices in regards to combating bias and supporting LGBTQ students specifically, including the potential barriers to doing so. Lastly, we offer recommendations for both further research and specific programmatic and policy strategies that may help schools reduce the risk of peer victimization, counter the damaging effects of bias, and provide safe and supportive learning environments for all LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ students alike. MethodsFindings in this study came from online surveys conducted by Harris Poll, on behalf of GLSEN, among 1,367 U.S. secondary school (middle or high school grades) students age 13-18, and 1,015 U.S. secondary school teachers. The national sample was drawn primarily from the Harris Poll Online (HPOL) opt-in panel and supplemented with a sample from trusted partner panels. For both the student and the teacher surveys, data was weighted to reflect the corresponding U.S. national population (i.e., middle/high school grade students, full-time teachers of middle/high school grade students). GLSEN is responsible for all data analyses, interpretations, and conclusions.Summary of FindingsSECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTSBiased LanguageOverall, students reported high levels of biased language in their schools from students and a sizeable number heard them often from teachers and other school staff. Furthermore, many students reported low levels of intervention by teachers and other school staff.FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY3Biased Remarks from Students• The most common types of biased remarks heard were: expressions using “gay” in a negative way, e.g. “that’s so gay” (55.0% heard often or very often), sexist remarks (56.0% heard often or very often), and racist remarks (55.4% heard often or very often).• 42.9% of students heard other homophobic remarks (e.g., “faggot,” “dyke,” “queer”) often or very often.• About a third of students (32.9%) reported hearing negative remarks about ability often or very often. • Less than a quarter (22.0%) of students heard negative remarks about gender expression from other students often or very often.• The least commonly heard remarks were negative remarks about transgender people (14.2% of students heard often or very often) and negative religious remarks (9.5% heard often or very often).• Students in 2015 reported lower incidence of all types of biased remarks, except racist remarks, than students in 2005.Biased Remarks from Teachers and School Staff• One quarter (25.5%) of students reported hearing school staff make negative remarks related to students’ gender expression.• Approximately one-fifth of students reported hearing school staff make negative remarks about students’ academic ability (22.5%) and sexist remarks (20.6%).• Students also reported hearing school staff make homophobic remarks (15.3%), racist remarks (14.4%), negative remarks about religion (14.1%), and negative remarks about transgender people (12.6%).Teacher and School Staff Intervention• Over a third of students reported teachers and other school staff intervened often or very often when they heard racist remarks (35.8%) or sexist remarks (33.9%).• Over a quarter of students reported that school staff often or very often intervened when hearing “that’s so gay” (27.6%), or other homophobic remarks (28.3%).• Students were least likely to report that staff intervened in hearing negative remarks about gender expression - 18.5% reported that they did so often or very often.• In 2015, students were less likely to report that school staff intervened in homophobic remarks and sexist remarks than in 2005.School Safety, Bullying, and HarassmentThe majority of students felt safe at school, however a sizeable percentage of students had reported feeling unsafe, often based on personal characteristics. Many students also experienced incidents of in-school victimization, such as bullying and harassment, based on personal characteristics. Lack of safety resulted  in many students missing school.School Safety• 9 out of 10 students felt safe at school with half of students (49.6%) reporting that they felt “very safe.”• The most common reason students reported feeling unsafe at school was related to their appearance/body size (33.3%), followed by sexual orientation (9.8%), and race/ethnicity (9.4%).• 17.7% of students reported missing one or more days of school in the past month because they felt unsafe  or uncomfortable.• Students reported feeling somewhat more safe in school in 2015 than in 2005; however, they were more likely to miss school because of feeling unsafe in 2015 than those in 2005.Bullying and Harassment• Students named the most common reasons other students are bullied, called names, or harassed as: their body size/appearance (36.2%), actual/perceived sexual orientation (19.2%), race/ethnicity (10.4%), academic ability (10.1%), and how masculine or feminine they are (9.2%).4FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY• Almost three-quarters (73.9%) of students reported personally experiencing some type of peer victimization in the past school year.• The majority of students experienced incidents of bias-based bullying, i.e., bullying based on personal characteristics: – Most commonly students experienced verbal harassment based on appearance or body size/type (50.9%) and actual/perceived race/ethnicity (30.3%). – About a fifth of students reported verbal harassment based on gender expression (21.9%) or actual  or perceived sexual orientation (19.4%). – Fewer students reported verbal harassment based on gender (18.1%), actual or perceived religion (18.0%), and actual or perceived disability (12.7%). – In general, incidents of bias-based physical harassment and assault were less common than verbal harassment, but followed the same pattern of prevalence.• Students reported experiencing other types of peer victimization, including: having mean rumors  or lies told about them at school (54.8%), property damage (38.9%), cyberbullying (33.8%), and sexual  harassment (28.8%).• Higher levels of in-school victimization were related to lower educational aspirations, higher rates of school discipline, and greater likelihood of missing school.From 2005 to 2015, we found no changes in students’ reports of their own personal experiences of bias-based victimization. However, their reports of frequency of bias-based bullying experienced by other students did change:• In 2015, students reported that other students were bullied less often than students in 2005 regarding their sexual orientation, gender expression, and appearance.• In 2015, students reported higher levels of bullying based on academic ability.Student Attitudes and Familiarity with LGBT PeopleOverall, the general student body appears to be relatively accepting of LGBT people, and most have LGBT people in their lives, either as peers, friends, or family members. • Most (88.0%) students indicated that they did not have a problem with people who are LGBT.• The vast majority of students (82.1%) reported knowing someone who was LGBT. Students were more likely to report knowing someone who was lesbian, gay, or bisexual than they were to report knowing someone who was transgender. – Almost three-quarters (72.6%) of students reported knowing an LGBT classmate (71.5% knew an LGB student, 15.9% knew a transgender student). – 22.5% of students reported having LGBT family members, including 2.2% with LGBT parents. • Students who knew someone who was LGBT held less negative attitudes towards LGBT people than students who did not know any LGBT people.LGBT-Related ResourcesLGBT-related resources have been shown to improve school climate for LGBTQ students by raising awareness about LGBT people and the issues they face, as well as by providing safe spaces and protections for LGBT youth to feel welcome and protected during the school day. Although these resources are related to more positive school climate for students overall, they may even be more critical for LGBTQ students. Unfortunately, most students do not have access to these resources.Supportive Student Clubs, i.e. Gay Straight Alliances (GSAs)• Over a third (35.8%) of students said that their school had a GSA or similar student club.• Students in schools with a GSA heard anti-LGBTQ remarks less often in school and had more positive attitudes towards LGBT people than students in schools without a GSA.FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY5• Students in schools with a GSA experienced less victimization based on race/ethnicity and based on appearance than students without a GSA; LGBTQ students also experienced less victimization based on sexual orientation.• The presence of a GSA was related to greater feelings of safety for the general student body, with an even greater improvement in safety for LGBTQ students specifically.• There has been a significant increase in the percentage of students who reported having a GSA in their school—from 21.2% in 2005 to 35.8% in 2015.LGBT-Inclusive Curriculum• One-fifth (20.8%) of students said that they had been taught about LGBT people, history, or events in any of their classes.• For LGBTQ students, being taught about LGBT topics in any of their classes was related to lower levels of LGBT-related victimization.School Anti-Bullying/Harassment Policies• The majority (87.4%) of students had a general anti-bullying policy. Among those who had a policy, 54.5% reported that their policy enumerated protections for sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.• Students attending school with an enumerated policy: – Heard homophobic and racist remarks less often compared to students with no policy;  – Were less likely to feel unsafe in school compared to students in schools with generic or no policies; and  – Were less likely to perceive bullying, name-calling, or harassment as a problem at their school compared to students in schools with a generic policy or with no policy.• More students in 2015 reported that their school had policy (either a generic policy or an LGBT-enumerated policy) than students in 2005.Differences in School Experiences between LGBTQ and Non-LGBTQ StudentsLGBTQ students face a more hostile environment than their peers. They experience higher rates of victimization and, as a result, they are at greater risk for lower educational outcomes.• Bias-based bullying. LGBTQ students experienced higher levels of bias-based bullying and harassment. Specifically, compared to non-LGBTQ students, they were more likely to be bullied or harassed based  on actual/perceived sexual orientation (67.0% vs. 13.5%), gender expression (59.7% vs. 17.6%),  gender (39.9% vs. 17.0%), appearance/body size (68.4% vs. 50.3%), and ability (26.7% vs. 12.2%).• Other harassment and bullying. LGBTQ students were also more likely to experience sexual harassment (43.6% vs. 26.4%), having rumors/lies spread about them (67.2% vs. 52.7%), property damage  (44.1% vs. 38.1%) and cyberbullying (40.2% vs. 32.8%) than non-LGBTQ students.• Safety and missing school. LGBTQ students reported feeling less safe at school, and were more than twice as likely to have missed school in past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (36.6% of LGBTQ students vs. 14.7% of non-LGBTQ students).• School discipline. Almost two thirds (62.8%) of LGBTQ students experienced school discipline  (e.g., detention, suspension) compared to less than half (45.8%) of non-LGBTQ students. • Educational aspirations. LGBTQ students were more likely to report that they did not plan to complete  high school (2.7% vs. 0.8% of non-LGBTQ students) or to continue their education past high school  (9.6% vs. 5.7%).• Extracurricular activities. LGBTQ students were half as likely as non-LGBTQ students to participate in both interscholastic (40.2% vs. 19.2%) and intramural sports (35.8% vs. 15.9%). However, LGBTQ students were more likely to participate in GSAs (37.8% vs. 12.3%), other types of social justice clubs (e.g., Amnesty International, diversity club) (13.5% vs. 6.2%), music activities (e.g., band, chorus) (49.1% vs. 39.0%), and theater activities (36.6% vs. 19.6%).6FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARYSECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS Biased RemarksTeachers report hearing many biased remarks from students; however, they do not always intervene, especially when hearing negative remarks about transgender people.• The most commonly heard biased language by teachers was the expression “that’s so gay” or “you’re so gay” (40.4% heard often/very often), followed by sexist remarks (33.8%), and negative remarks about other student’s ability (22.8%).• Although teachers generally intervened when hearing biased remarks, teachers intervened most often when hearing sexist remarks (57.2% often or very often) and least often when hearing negative remarks about transgender people (45.2% often or very often).• Overall, teachers reported being comfortable intervening in all types of remarks—although they were most comfortable intervening in negative remarks about ability and least comfortable intervening in negative remarks about gender expression and transgender people (59.8%, 49.3%, and 50.0% were very comfortable, respectively).• With the exception of racist remarks and negative remarks about religion, teachers in 2015 reported lower incidences of all other remarks than teachers in 2005.• Teachers reported a lower comfort level intervening in biased remarks in 2015 than in 2005.Bullying, Harassment, and Name-CallingMost teachers believe that bullying, name-calling, or harassment is a serious problem at their school. However, teachers are reporting less bullying based on appearance, academic ability, gender expression,  and sexual orientation than they did ten years ago.• Half (51.2%) of teachers believed that bullying, name-calling, or harassment was a serious problem at  their school.• Teachers reported that bullying, name calling, and harassment occurred most often based on students’ appearance, followed by academic ability, gender expression, and sexual orientation.• Teachers reported being most comfortable addressing bullying based on race/ethnicity or religion and least comfortable addressing bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression (53.6%, 52.6% and 48.3%, 44.9% reported being very comfortable, respectively).• Teachers in 2015 reported that other students were bullied less often regarding their appearance, academic ability, gender expression, and sexual orientation than teachers in 2005.Beliefs about School Safety for LGBT StudentsMost teachers believe they have an obligation to ensure safe and supportive learning environments for LGBT students. However, many teachers believe their schools are not entirely safe for LGBT and gender nonconforming students.• 83.3% of teachers agreed that teachers and other school personnel have an obligation to ensure safe and supportive learning environments for LGBT students.• Teachers believed that a variety of efforts would be helpful in creating safer schools for LGBTQ students: inclusive bullying/discrimination policies: 91.3%, administrator support: 89.2%, teacher training: 88.8%, GSA: 85.6%.• Teachers in 2015 believed that having each the following supports would be more helpful than did  teachers in 2005: teacher training on LGBT student issues, inclusive policies, GSA or similar student club, and a principal and/or superintendent who more openly addresses safety issues for LGBT students and supports educators.Engagement in LGBT Supportive PracticesWhether by providing direct support to individual students or taking proactive steps to create a positive environment, teachers can help to improve school climate. However, only about half of teachers reported engaging in LGBT-related practices.FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY7• 50.3% of teachers reported engaging in at least one LGBT-related practice.• Teachers were most likely to engage in practices involving direct individual interactions with students: 33.7% discussed LGBT issues with students, 28.1% provided one-on-one support to LGBT students.• Fewer teachers engaged in more visible activities: 14.9% included LGBT topics in their curriculum, and 11.9% displayed LGBT supportive materials (e.g., Safe Space sticker). • Teachers were least likely to work on more school-wide issues: 9.6% advocated for staff training,  or educated staff on LGBT-related issues, 8.5% advocated for LGBT-inclusive policies, and 4.1% served  as a GSA advisor.• Most teachers felt comfortable (somewhat or very) addressing LGBT issues with individual students, such as supporting LGBT students (60.2%) and responding to students’ questions about LGBT people (62.9%). Teachers were less comfortable with those activities that entailed more official or public roles: GSA (35.3%); incorporating LGBT topics into their teaching or curriculum (33.1%).Teacher Professional DevelopmentTeachers need to be adequately prepared to effectively address bias, bullying, and LGBTQ issues. Most teachers are receiving professional development on bullying and diversity issues. Teachers are less likely to have any training on LGBT student issues, though they indicate that they would find it helpful. • The vast majority of teachers had received some type of professional development (either pre-service and/in-service) on topics of bullying and harassment (85.1%) and diversity/multicultural education (76.4%).• Teachers were far less likely to have received professional development on LGBT issues, compared to bullying and harassment or diversity/multicultural education. Less than a third of teachers ever had any professional development on LGB student issues (32.9%); less than a quarter had any on transgender student issues (23.6%).• Teachers were least likely to have received professional development during their pre-service education, as opposed to in their current or former position. Bullying/harassment: 14.3%, Diversity/multicultural education: 18.9%; LGB student issues: 9.2%; Transgender student issues: 6.1%.• Professional development on diversity, LGB issues, and transgender issues were most closely related to greater involvement in LGBT-supportive practices.Anti-Bullying PoliciesAlthough most teachers reported that their school had an anti-bullying policy, considerably fewer noted that the policy was LGBT-enumerated. Teachers in schools with LGBT-enumerated policies were more likely to report biased language and bias-based bullying. This might be the result of teachers in these schools being more aware of bias-based bullying behavior.• Nine in ten (90.8%) teachers believed their school had an anti-bullying policy; over half of teachers (52.0%) reported that their school’s policy was LGBT-enumerated for both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.• Teachers in schools with an anti-bullying policy (regardless of type) reported hearing sexist remarks  and expressions using gay in a negative way (i.e., “that’s so gay”) more often than teachers in schools without a policy. • Teachers from schools with an LGBT-enumerated anti-bullying policy heard homophobic remarks, negative remarks about gender expression negative religious remarks, and negative remarks about transgender people, more often than teachers in a school with a generic anti-bullying policy. • Teachers in schools with LGBT-enumerated policy reported higher prevalence of bullying and harassment due to race/ethnicity, appearance, and academic ability than teachers in schools with no policies. • Teachers in schools with anti-bullying policies (regardless of type) reported higher levels of comfort addressing bullying based on sexual orientation compared to teachers in schools with no policy.8FROM TEASING TO TORMENT: SCHOOL CLIMATE REVISITED EXECUTIVE SUMMARYSchool policies appear to facilitate professional development, perhaps by mandating training for school staff.• Teachers in schools with an anti-bullying policy were more likely to have received professional development on bullying/harassment issues.• Teachers in schools with LGBT-enumerated policies were more likely than teachers in schools with generic policies and schools with no policies to have received LGBT-related professional development.MORE FINDINGS IN THE FULL REPORT ON:• Demographic differences in student experiences, including differences based on race/ethnicity, sex, gender nonconformity (based on gender expression), and socio-economic status.• Differences in teachers’ practices and beliefs based on years of experience, subject area, LGBT identity, and familiarity with LGBT people.• Differences in school climate based on school level (middle vs. high school), school type (public, private, religious), school socio-economic status, and geographic area, including region and local (urban, suburban, small town/rural)• Participation in extracurricular activities• Students’ experiences with school discipline• Prevalence and usefulness on sex education• Gender expression of students and prevalence of gender nonconformity• Barriers to teachers’ actions in support of LGBT students• Teachers’ comfort level addressing biased incidents and engaging in LGBT-supportive practices….and more….Conclusions and Recommendations Findings from From Teasing to Torment: School Climate Revisited demonstrate that although the overall landscape for secondary schools in the U.S. is gradually improving in regards to school safety and climate, the current educational environment for many students remains troublesome. Our results demonstrate that although most students feel relatively safe at school, secondary schools are still rife with bias—students and teachers alike report high levels of many types of biased language and many note that bullying and harassment are still significant concerns. This was particularly true for LGBTQ students who faced higher levels of victimization and poorer educational outcomes than their non-LGBTQ peers. However, findings comparing our 2005 surveys to the 2015 surveys illustrate some promising trends: students and teachers reported hearing fewer biased remarks, students felt safer in school, and students reported that their peers were more likely to speak out against homophobic remarks. Furthermore, students and teachers both reported less bullying based on sexual orientation, gender expression, and appearance. The availability of supports such as student clubs that address LGBT issues (e.g., Gay-Straight Alliances) and enumerated anti-bullying/harassment policies have increased in the past decade. Nevertheless, some of the findings on changes over time are concerning. Specifically, teachers were less likely to intervene in homophobic and sexist remarks in 2015 and they felt less comfortable intervening in all types of biased remarks than did teachers in 2005. In addition, the positive trends regarding decreases in student bias were not reflected in bias related to race/ethnicity. In most cases, there was either no change or an increase in these types of incidents.This report also brought to light the critical need to support effective teacher practices and implement supportive school resources and policies. Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) were related to fewer anti-LGBTQ remarks in school and more positive attitudes towards LGBT students. They were also related to greater safety and less victimization for the general student body, with even greater benefits for LGBTQ students. LGBT-inclusive curriculum was related to less victimization for LGBTQ students, although was not related to general student attitudes about LGBT people. LGBT-enumerated anti-bullying policies were linked to less homophobic and racist remarks and greater feelings of safety in school. However, despite their potential benefits, only a minority of students had access to these resources in their schools. 9Despite the increase in LGBT school supports, teachers themselves appear to face challenges when dealing with LGBT issues in their schools. Although teachers overwhelmingly endorsed the idea that they have an obligation to ensure safe and supportive schools for LGBT students, when it came to taking action to do so, many seemed to struggle. Overall, teachers reported relatively high levels of comfort addressing bias and bullying, but they were least comfortable addressing incidents related to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, in comparison to other types of bias, such as bias based on race, ability, or religion. Furthermore, only half of teachers reported engaging in specific efforts to support LGBTQ students, such as displaying visible symbols of support (e.g., Safe Space Sticker), incorporating LGBT topics into their teaching, or advocating for inclusive policies. Perhaps not surprisingly given their limited activities in support of LGBTQ students, most teachers had not received any professional development on LGBT student issues, neither in their pre-service education nor during their teaching career. Those teachers who had received LGBT-related training were more likely to intervene in biased remarks and more likely to engage in LGBT-supportive practices. In contrast, the vast majority of teachers had received professional development on bullying/harassment topics and on diversity/multicultural education. Yet, while diversity/multicultural education professional development was related to improved practices related to bias and LGBTQ student issues, professional development on bullying was not. In order to improve school climate and provide all students with the access to education they deserve, educators, policymakers, and advocates must take action. Based on our findings, we recommend the following measures:• Ensure adequate preparation for teachers through pre-service and in-service professional development that specifically addresses biased behaviors and LGBTQ student issues and provides opportunities for skill development. • Incorporate meaningful content on bias-based bullying into bullying/harassment education and training programs for both educators and students. Specifically address the victimization of traditionally marginalized students, such as LGBTQ students, gender nonconforming students, students of color, and students with disabilities.• Increase student access to curriculum that incorporates LGBTQ people, history, and topics. Provide resources for teachers of all subjects to integrate LGBT issues into their curriculum and effectively address bias in their classroom.• Support the implementation of student clubs such as Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs) that provide support for LGBT students and address LGBT issues in education.• Adopt and implement anti-bullying/harassment policies at the school and district level that explicitly enumerate sexual orientation and gender identity/expression as protected categories alongside others such as race/ethnicity, religion, and disability. Ensure fair and appropriate enforcement of these policies. Make certain that members of the school community are aware of the existence and content of such policies.• Engage in research to identify factors related to more positive student attitudes and decreased biased behaviors among students and develop best practices for fostering respect among secondary students.• Regularly assess school climate at the building or district level to identify potential areas of need and measure progress. Be sure to include ways to identify potential disparities among groups of students, such as LGBTQ students, gender nonconforming students, students of color, and students with disabilities.Together, our recommendations offer strategies to reduce bullying and harassment based on personal characteristics and ensure all students; including LGBTQ students, are afforded an equal opportunity to an education. Furthermore, we call for further research to help us continue to develop our understanding of bullying and harassment, and the resources and practices schools can utilize to reduce both its occurrence and its negative impact on student outcomes. Schools and school districts must work to eliminate hostile environments, and teacher preparation programs must equip teachers to effectively and confidentially address issues of bias and support marginalized students, such as LGBTQ students. The recommendations set forth in this report will help to create more safe and affirming school schools for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.110 William Street New York, NY 10038 Ph: 212.727.0135 Fax: 212.727.0254 www.glsen.orgGLSEN champions safe and affirming schools for all students.

    "abstract": "From Teasing to Torment: School Climate Revisited, A Survey of U.S. Secondary School Students and Teachers affords us the opportunity to document the current state of safety, bias, and bullying in schools and assess potential disparities based not only on LGBTQ status, but also on race/ethnicity, sex, gender expression, and socioeconomic status. As school climate is determined not only by the existence or absence of victimization, we also explore students' experiences with school disciplinary actions and extracurricular activities, seeking to develop a more complete picture of the student experience. In addition, we again document students' access to resources that may improve school climate, such as student clubs that address LGBTQ student issues, inclusive curriculum, and anti-bullying/harassment policies. Moreover, in this report, secondary school teachers offer their perceptions on bias, bullying, and LGBTQ students' safety, and provide valuable information about the preparation they may have received to address these issues. We also document teachers' practices in regards to combating bias and supporting LGBTQ students specifically, including the potential barriers to doing so. Lastly, we offer recommendations for both further research and specific programmatic and policy strategies that may help schools reduce the risk of peer victimization, counter the damaging effects of bias, and provide safe and supportive learning environments for all LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ students alike",
