Hodges settled a decades-long national debate over the legality of same-sex marriage.Since Obergefell, however, local and state legislatures in conservative and mostly rural states have proposed and passed hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills. Obergefell may have ended the legal debate over same-sex marriage, but it did not resolve the cultural divide. Many rural Americans,especially in predominately white communities, feel that they are under attack. Judicial opinions and legislation protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination are serious threats to rural dwellers because they conflict with several core tenets of rural identity: community solidarity, self-reliance, and compliance with religiously informed gender and sexual norms. This conflict is amplified by the relative invisibility of gay and transgender people who live in rural areas, and the predominately urban media representations of gay and transgender people. In several respects, the conflict is merely perceived and is not real. It is at these junctures of perceived conflict that we can draw important lessons for bridging the cultural divide, thereby protecting LGBTQ people across geographic spaces. This Article examines the sources and modern manifestations of rural LGBTQ resentment to provide foundational insights for the ongoing fight to protect all vulnerable minorities. Pro-LGBTQ legislation and judicial opinions symbolize a changing America in which white rural inhabitants see their identities disappearing, devalued, and disrespected. The left, popularly represented in rural America as a group of urban elites, characterizes anti-LGBTQ views as bigoted, and many people in small towns feel victimized by this criticism. Drawing on a robust body of social science research, this Article suggests that these feelings of victimization lead to resentment when outside forces, like federal judges and state and big-city legislators, tell rural Americans how to act, think,and feel. Rural Americans resent “undeserving” minorities who havegained rights and recognition, in contrast to the identities of, and at the perceived expense of, white, straight, working-class prestige. They resent                                                                                                                      * Visiting Professor, University of San Francisco School of Law.

Hodges1 that state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional.2 Obergefell settled a decades-long national debate over the legality of same-sex marriage that began in earnest in 1993, when the Hawaii Supreme Court in Baehr v. Lewin3 signaled that it would strike down its state’s same-sex marriage ban.4 In the decades following Baehr, anti-gay activists engaged in widespread and largely successful campaigns to ban same-sex marriage at the state level.5 The same-sex marriage debate had a strong geographic                                                                                                                      1. 135 S.

Id. at 58–68 (instructing lower courts to apply strict scrutiny).5. “In all, twenty-nine states, most of which already had legislative prohibitions on the books, passed state constitutional amendments limiting relationship recognition for same-sex 2Florida Law Review, Vol. 71, Iss. 4 [], Art. 1https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol71/iss4/12019] RURAL RESENTMENT AND LGBTQ EQUALITY 921component in that people living in rural areas were much more likely than urban dwellers to support the bans.6 Even after controlling for other factors, such as age, education, sex, and race, “[t]he odds of supporting an anti-gay marriage amendment are more than twice as high in rural communities of fewer than a thousand people as they are in cities of 250,000 people or more.”7The marriage debate was never just about marriage. Marriage symbolized a greater cultural clash over LGBTQ8 acceptance, tradition, and competing identities. Rural Americans, and white rural Americans in particular, feel that their distinctively rural way of life and their place-based identities are under attack.9 Judicial opinions and legislation protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination are perceived as serious threats to rural dwellers because they directly conflict with several core tenets of a shared rural identity: community solidarity, self-reliance, and compliance with religiously informed gender and sexual norms.10Heterosexuality and biologically congruent gender expression are interwoven into all three tenets. Pro-LGBTQ laws symbolize a changing America in which rural inhabitants see their identities disappearing, devalued, and disrespected in mainstream media and culture.11 Rural Americans once felt that opposition to homosexuality and gender nonconformity were shared American values, but now they feel that urban elites cast anti-LGBTQ views as shameful and bigoted.12 Many people in small towns feel victimized by this criticism.                                                                                                                      couples.” Stacey L.

This Article often uses “LGBTQ” as an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. “Queer” is a “multifaceted term that may refer to an attraction toward people of many genders, a challenge to the status quo, and/or a claim to not conforming to cultural norms around sexual orientation.” Erin S. Lavender-Stott et al., Challenges and Strategies of Sexual Minority Youth Research in Southwest Virginia, 65 J. HOMOSEXUALITY 691, 693 (2018). For stylistic breaks and diversity, and sometimes because not all members of the LGBTQ community are implicated by an issue, this Article also uses the acronym “LGBT” and the terms “gay” and “trans.”9.

In tandem with rural Americans’ feelings of social marginalization and victimization, they have also suffered real financial harm due to disappearing jobs and stagnant wage growth.21 Rural America thus feels socially and economically overlooked by those who hold power, and they resent their perceived invisibility.22 Meanwhile, Congress, under President Obama, passed legislation permitting gays to serve openly in the military23 despite rural opposition,24 the Supreme Court paved the way for same-sex marriage in all fifty states25 despite rural opposition,26and courts and legislatures are increasingly prohibiting sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in local workplaces and schools,despite rural opposition.27 The resentment stemming from feelings of invisibility has become exacerbated due to outside forces like big cities and state legislatures telling rural Americans how to act, think, and feel—                                                                                                                     belief that demands for LGBT-inclusive antidiscrimination laws “drive up the cost of government and create the need for higher taxes”).21.

Instead, it may have hardened opposition in some quarters and stoked the building resentment.29 For many rural Americans, opposing LGBTQ rights is an important mechanism to preserve a distinctively rural way of life, assert identities rooted in a rural place, and fight back against perceived victimization by urban elites. Historically, “the U.S. states that have the most intolerant laws related to gay and lesbian parenthood,” for example, “are disproportionately rural states.”30 In the last several years, legislators of predominantly rural states and small towns have channeled anti-gay resentment into hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills and proposals.31It is important to unearth and pay attention to rural anti-LGBTQ sentiment in the post-Obergefell era. In national discourse since the 2016 election and Donald Trump’s political ascension, LGBTQ issues have been somewhat muted in comparison to other important civil rights issues, such as the Muslim travel ban,32 anti-immigrant sentiment and policies,33 and sexual harassment of women in the workplace.34 The popular national narrative suggests an LGBTQ progress arc, with Obergefell symbolizing the ultimate victory in a long-fought struggle.

The same sentiment that fueled popularly enacted same-sex marriage bans still exists, and today it takes new and sometimes less visible forms. Dissecting rural resentment can help toforge a path that allows for the partial preservation of a distinctly rural way of life, while still protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination. Further, anti-LGBTQ resentment is part of a large social force in rural America that animates conservative politics across the United States. White rural Americans resent “undeserving” minorities who have gainedrights and recognition, in contrast to the identities of and at the perceived expense of white, straight, working-class prestige. In the rural “deep story,”35 to borrow a phrase from Arlie Russell Hochschild, undeserving minorities seek special benefits, special rights, and special protection from federal and state governments, while white and straight rural Americans foot both the economic and social bill.36 Resentment toward undeserving LGBTQ people who seek rights and protection from the government in various forms, including marriage, remains an important fixture of conservative political mobilization. This Article examines the sources and modern manifestations of rural LGBTQ resentment. Anti-LGBTQ resentment is one part of the story that explains our current national politics, and this Article provides insight that may be useful in the ongoing fight to protect all vulnerable minorities from a populist movement fueled in large part by white rural feelings of disenfranchisement. Part I lays the foundation for understanding the rural–urban divide as it relates to anti-LGBTQ legal mobilization by discussing two notable examples from different eras: Colorado’s Amendment 2 and North Carolina’s HB2. Part II identifies and explains three core tenets of rural identity that constitute a widely shared culture: community solidarity, self-reliance, and religiously informed gender and sexuality norms. Part III unpacks the disconnect between rural identity and LGBTQ identities. Part III.A explains how LGBTQ identities differ from rural identities, and why LGBTQ identities have urban connotations.

First, I draw heavily on and synthesize existing social science literature about rural America and the rural LGBTQ experience. Second, I am not an outsider to rural communities. I grew up in Washington, West Virginia (population 1,17539), which is just a short drive from Parkersburg, West Virginia (population 30,09640). Almost all of my family still lives in this area. I left West Virginia only a decade ago, which means I have spent most of my life in this predominately rural state. I came out as gay when I was twenty-three years old, while I attended the West Virginia University College of Law. My experiences both before and after I openly identified as gay provide direct insight into clashes between rural and gay identities. As in the tradition of feminist and critical race scholars,41 I share this small window into my background to position myself in this scholarly field as someone with a personal connection and perspective.

In the early 1970s, three cases produced written opinions regarding the constitutionality of statutes limiting marriage to one man and one woman: Baker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971); Jones v. Hallahan, 501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. 1973), abrogated by Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015); and Singer v. Hara, 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974). As Michael Boucai explains, however, these cases were different from those that movement activists brought beginning in the 1990s in that they “stood no chance of winning” and they were about radical liberation rather than formal equality.

In 1972, East Lansing, Michigan, home to Michigan State University, became the first municipality to adopt a pro-gay law, banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in hiring practices.43 By 1993, approximately 140 state and county laws, local ordinances, and executive orders prohibited certain forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.44 The brunt of these antidiscrimination laws were adopted in urban areas and progressive college towns.45 Today, twenty-one states and Washington, D.C. ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing, or public accommodations.46 Hundreds of localities do the same.47 In some states, however, protection is either non-existent or minimal. In Georgia, for example, only the major city of Atlanta has an ordinance prohibiting gender identity-based and sexual orientation-based discrimination.48 In Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Tennessee, no locality has any such ordinance.49During this longstanding and ongoing push for LGBTQ-inclusive antidiscrimination laws, two high-profile national controversies stand out as examples of a rural–urban divide over gay and transgender rights. These examples come from two different historical eras, one before marriage equality and one after, but both showcase an underlying sentiment that is relatively consistent across time.

When opponents and proponents of LGBTQ rightsclash, debates are rarely framed around issues of place. However, as Parts II and III discuss below, many rural inhabitants: (1) share identities strongly informed by small-town social and physical realities; (2) view LGBTQ issues and people as primarily urban; and (3) perceive rural identity as incompatible with, and under attack by, supposedly urban LGBTQ forces. This place-based divide serves as fuel in the national LGBTQ rights battle, particularly today as the religious right—a strong political force in small-town America—overtly deploys the rhetoric of victimhood in debates about religious liberties. Romer and HB2 thus offer two lenses for viewing some of the usually unseen geographic components of why LGBTQ equality remains so contentious. A.  Romer v. EvansColorado is a somewhat dichotomous state in terms of population density. Its western region has “a low population and is primarily rural agricultural,” whereas its eastern region “has a high population and is generally urban.”54 Colorado’s most progressive inhabitants live in large cities like Boulder and Denver, or in resort cities like Aspen, while the majority of Colorado’s conservative voters live in the state’s rural areas.55In 1977, Aspen became the first city in Colorado to pass an ordinance prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.56 In 1987, without much organized                                                                                                                      52.

A group called Colorado Family Values (CFV) formed, collaborated with well-known anti-gay televangelist Pat Robertson, drafted Amendment 2, and began the petition drive to get Amendment 2 in front of voters in the 1992 statewide election.59Amendment 2 purported to repeal all existing Colorado ordinances prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and it would bar all future “legislative, executive or judicial action at any level of state or local government designed to protect” homosexual or bisexual people.60CFV campaigned in support of Amendment 2 around the theme that gays should not receive “special rights” that would dilute legitimate discrimination claims by other marginalized groups.61 The argument suggested that gay people are not like racial minorities because gays already have economic and social privilege and are merely seeking protection to engage in immoral conduct.62 CFV published and disseminated a tabloid called “Equal Rights—Not Special Rights!,”63 in which it explicitly characterized gay people as wealthy, well-educated, more likely to hold professional or managerial positions, more likely totravel overseas, and regular attendees of (urban) gay pride parades and festivals that display “offensive” messages.64 This characterization of the                                                                                                                      57.

First, the special rights rhetoric stoked rural class resentment. Most rural communities are comprised of blue-collar workers who have seen manufacturing and natural resource-reliant jobs dwindle in recent decades.74 Many rural families are struggling financially and have difficulty paying for basics like food, clothing, mortgage payments, and health care.75 Meanwhile, Amendment 2 proponents painted gays as monied white-collar workers who have both the time and resources to live in comfort—and even take expensive international vacations.76 The image of international vacationers can be particularly galling to many rural inhabitants because it suggests cosmopolitanism and elitism, and because such an overt showing of wealth belies rural humility norms.77Second, the special rights rhetoric stoked gender resentment. For rural men, hard and dirty manual labor is often a core tenet of masculinity.78Many rural men view urban white-collar workers as reaping financial and status rewards by doing softer, less manly work. Moreover, rural class and gender resentment intertwine due to the material financial realities79of disappearing rural jobs and what those realities mean for rural men’s masculinity. Most rural families now require two wage-earners, and rural men can no longer satisfy the traditional masculine requirement of being the sole breadwinner for their families.80 While rural men’s sense of                                                                                                                      73.

The perceived power of urban gay men is particularly insulting to both rural men and women because rural gender norms value a male and female binary with congruent masculine and feminine gender presentation, and because those same gender norms equate homosexuality with gender inversion.81Third, the special rights rhetoric stoked religious resentment. A core part of rural identity is religiosity, particularly Christianity.82 Pursuant to most Christian teachings, sexuality is properly contained in a marriage between one man and one woman, while homosexuality is a sinful lifestyle from which individuals can be saved by prayer.83 Proponents of Amendment 2 stoked rural Christians’ worst fears about unrestrained sexuality by distributing literature and saturating small-town television sets with images of shirtless LGBTQ people kissing, dancing, and groping each other in public.84 It was no accident that much of the visual media saturation featured images specifically from San Francisco Pride; this confirmed, for rural people, that the deviant and immoral sexuality of LGBTQ people is an urban rather than rural phenomenon. After Colorado voters approved Amendment 2, litigation began that culminated in the U.S. Supreme Court’s Romer v. Evans85 decision. The Court in Romer held that Amendment 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause because it bore no rational relationship to any legitimate governmental interest.86 Instead, due to the law’s breadth and the gross mismatch between its effects and Colorado’s asserted interests,87 it raised “the inevitable inference that the disadvantage imposed is born of animosity” toward gays, bisexuals, and lesbians.88 The Court on multiple                                                                                                                      81.

First, Justice Scalia rejected the Court’s analysis that animus infected Amendment 2, instead characterizing those who voted for Amendment 2 as “tolerant Coloradans” seeking to “preserve traditional sexual mores” who were victims of “a politically powerful” gay minority group.90 Second, in casting gays as politically powerful, Scalia unambiguously adopted the CFV’s special rights depiction of who gay people are: “those who engage in homosexual conduct tend to reside in disproportionate numbers in certain communities” and “have high disposable income.”91 Scalia sympathizedwith the rural resentment of these urban outsiders, stressing that, not only had (rural) Coloradans been exposed to “homosexuals’ quest for social endorsement” in “newspaper accounts of happenings in places such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Key West,”92 but also gay rights had already arrived in nearby cities like Aspen, Boulder, and Denver.93 The ominous message seems to be: if it can happen there (big cities) it can happen here (small towns in Colorado and elsewhere). Playing again on the theme of victimization, Scalia concluded with regret that Coloradans’ modest attempt to “counter both the geographic concentration and the disproportionate political power”94 of gays and lesbians, and their “adherence to traditional attitudes,”95 were “verbally disparag[ed] as bigotry.”96Implied in both CFV’s rhetoric and in Justice Scalia’s analysis is the belief that gays are powerful, wealthy, and immoral urbanites. This representation pits gays directly against rural Americans’ self-concept as invisible to political elites, lacking in political power, hard workers of                                                                                                                      89.

This identity gulf is the crux of rural resentment. Notably, after Amendment 2 passed but before the Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional, conservative activists in Oregon deployed the special rights strategy and its attendant rural–urban divide component in attempts to block gay rights at the state level and in many small towns. As Professor Mary Gray explains, “[a]rguments that gays and lesbians might get a leg up through ‘special rights’ proved persuasive because they tapped into a palpable stress over status loss and a sense of disenfranchisement locals experienced across much of the economically depressed rural communities . . . .”97 Professor Arlene Stein elaborates that the Oregon anti-gay campaign hit all three strains of rural resentment discussed above: class, gender, and religion.98 Homosexuality “was a perfect ‘wedge’ issue” because, for rural Americans, it sanctions “the worst excesses of the permissive society: tolerance for a nonprocreative sexuality;” “lack of respect for men and women’s ‘true’ differences; and the rise of civil rights strategies that improved the position of women, minorities, and even homosexuals, purportedly at the expense of working families.”99 In the summer of 1993, six small towns and rural counties in Oregon voted to approve—some by a 2–1 margin—local ballot measures to prevent governments from spending money to promote homosexuality.100 By the end of 1994, twenty-six mostly rural localities had endorsed anti-gay initiatives, many barring special protections for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals in the same vein of Amendment 2.101The Amendment 2 campaign, the Oregon anti-gay initiatives, and Romer v. Evans are strong, yet somewhat rare, examples of how the rural–urban divide visibly motivates anti-gay politics. This geographic conflict remains at play today, but often in subtler ways than in the special rights campaigns of the ‘90s. B. North Carolina’s HB2North Carolina is a predominately rural state. After the 2010 Census, North Carolina ranked thirty-seventh among the fifty states for proportion of population classified as urban—with “urban” referring generally to                                                                                                                      97.

First, HB2 required that all North Carolina multiple-occupancy public restrooms and changing facilities be segregated by biological sex.123 The bill defined “[b]iological sex” as “[t]he physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.”124 In North Carolina, changing sex on a birth certificate requires sex reassignment surgery,125 which is a medical procedure that many trans people cannot afford or do not want.126 Second, HB2 preempted all local anti-discrimination ordinances by declaring that only the state can enact lawsaddressing discrimination.127 North Carolina state law, however, does not prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender identity.128 The intended effect of this part of HB2, then, was to repeal every aspect of Charlotte’s pro-LGBTQ ordinance, and to bar other liberal cities from including sexual orientation and gender identity as protected traits in civil rights laws. In this way, HB2 was reminiscent of Colorado’s popularly enacted Amendment 2, which similarly repealed several cities’ gay rights laws and barred future pro-gay efforts.129After just three hours of debate, the state House passed HB2 in an 84–25 vote, with all republicans voting in favor.130 HB2 then passed in the state Senate in a 32–0 vote, after all Senate Democrats refused to vote                                                                                                                      122.

The state legislature’s rapid response left little time for activists and politicians to overtly deploy the politics of rural identity and resentment and mobilize opposition to perceived urban overreach on gay and trans rights issues, unlike the lengthy public campaign that conservatives ran decades earlier in supportof Colorado’s Amendment 2. Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence suggests that small-town values fed the need to strike back at urban Charlotte and dictated the scope of the anti-LGBTQ backlash. First, the geopolitical makeup of the General Assembly offers one indication that the rural–urban divide was at play. Historically, small towns and their attendant socially conservative ideologies have dominated North Carolina state politics.134 That tradition remained strong in 2016, when Republicans hailing from small towns and rural areas across the state controlled the General Assembly with veto-proof majorities in both chambers.135 As the Raleigh News & Observerdeclared, “Rural legislators rule the roost in the General Assembly.”136The day following Charlotte’s approval of the gay and trans rights ordinance, the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Republican Tim Moore, vowed that North Carolina lawmakers would take steps “to correct this radical course.”137 Moore is from the small town of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, which has a population of                                                                                                                      131.

In one story about HB2 for the Raleigh News & Observer, a journalist explainedthat the state’s “skepticism of social movements is rooted in its Bible Belt, rural and small-town heritage,” and noted that gay and trans acceptance is “different in Charlotte than in [small-town] Rocky Mount” because it “depends, in part, on geography.”145 That journalist noted in an earlier News & Observer article that HB2 “underscored” the rural–urban cultural differences: “rural areas tend to be far more culturally                                                                                                                      138.

As this Article discusses more fully in Part II, a core tenet of rural identity is Christianity.149 In southern states like North Carolina, Christians are more likely to be evangelical fundamentalists,150 and many evangelicals view the Bible as the literal word of God.151In conflict with gay rights, most Christian denominations in the United States, and certainly fundamentalist denominations, teach that homosexuality is immoral, sinful, and should be discouraged in favor of heterosexuality.152 HB2’s provisions preventing large cities from protecting gay individuals from sexual orientation-based discrimination is thus one way for rural communities to project and preserve this central component of the self. In conflict with trans rights, most Christian denominations share a belief in “natural gender differences”153 that spring congruently from biological sex assignments made by anatomical                                                                                                                      146.

Christianity stigmatizes gender nonconformity and strongly encourages men and women to assume appropriate male and female roles.154 Requiring transgender individuals to use the restroom that matches their biologically assigned sex defeats trans individuals’claims to legally sanctioned gender differences, choice, and fluidity. HB2’s bathroom components are thus another way for rural residents to project and preserve their identities. After intense economic backlash against HB2 from outside businesses,155 this particular gay and trans rights controversy ended in compromise when Charlotte partially repealed its LGBTQ rights ordinance156 and North Carolina partially repealed HB2.157 At the national level, North Carolina as a whole took heat from LGBTQ rights activists as a backwards state.158 The story on the ground is far more geographically complicated. It is important to draw attention to the rural–urban divide because it silently, yet powerfully animates many remaining LGBTQ rights battles across the country today. II. RURAL IDENTITYTo discuss a shared sense of “rural identity,” it is important to first clarify what “rural” means. Many definitions focus on population size or population density,159 which is typically the approach that federal and                                                                                                                      154.

This Article does not seek to essentialize all rural people and places, and it acknowledges the vast diversity of small towns in America.164 Indeed, exurbs, small college towns, and resort communities look and feel very different from the average low population density environment.165 This Article deploys “rural” only to describe the social and economic commonalities of most,but certainly not all, rural areas.

Rural-specific identities include shared moral and cultural values.173 Often, these shared values form and operate in opposition to the actual or perceived values of urban areas.174 In fact, many people stay in or move to rural areas because they actively dislike big cities and what they perceive to be big city attitudes and behaviors.175 This Article heavily draws on both quantitative and qualitative social science work about rural America and the rural LGBTQ experience to identify three core tenets176 that constitute rural                                                                                                                      168.

A. Community Solidarity Rural identity includes the valued notion of community solidarity.177Community solidarity helps foster a sense of belonging and purpose in geographic locations otherwise physically isolated from the rest of society.178 Community solidarity forms due to a confluence of factors. First, although every rural community is unique in many ways, a nearly universal characteristic is the relative lack of individual anonymity.179People develop close personal ties with each other, and the community as a whole operates on a highly personalized basis.180 Even in small towns that are too large for people to know literally every resident, low population density means that “everybody knows everybody else” is a common rural sentiment.181 The relative lack of rural anonymity helps facilitate the dissemination and policing of shared and deeply held moral and cultural values.182Second, the fact that many rural inhabitants have deep family roots in the area amplifies feelings of familiarity.183 Some families have local ties dating back to the first white settlers, rendering rural areas internally homogenous in heritage and ethnic backgrounds.184 Most rural areas today are losing residents rather than gaining newcomers,185 which exacerbates the problem of racial and cultural homogeneity. This relative lack of diversity,186 paired with the sense that everyone knows each other,                                                                                                                      177.

Each rural community is somewhat different in terms of the specific traditions and values that its inhabitants share, but some values are relatively consistent from place to place. For example, many people in small towns point to “being known as a good person” as important, and this often goes hand-in-hand with having strong family connections and personal ties with others.191 Importantly, being a good person also means being humble and authentic.192Humility and authenticity in rural America can mean many things, including but not limited to: blending in,193 not calling undue attention to oneself, and not being “disruptive”194 (that is, being “normal”195);modesty and unpretentiousness about one’s skills and financial resources; honesty; and a down-to-earth style in daily interactions.196 Much of humility and authenticity is about class performativity, and many of the rural class markers at work embody an implicit or explicit rejection of the                                                                                                                      187.

Vance offers the rejection of elitism as one explanation for why so many rural people disliked Barack Obama: he is from Chicago, a graduate of two Ivy League schools, is “brilliant” and “wealthy,” has a “clean, perfect, neutral” accent, and “[n]othing about him,” including his race, “bears any resemblance” to most people in white rural America.198Further, people everywhere express identity and project their sense of authentic self through consumption-related activities. In rural America, those cultural activities include things like people’s “selection of music (country versus rap) and their choice of clothing (cowboy boots versus wing tips).”199 For men, this might mean avoiding certain “art, music, language[,] and culture” interests that do not comport with blue collarrural gender norms, while doing things that signal authentic rugged masculinity such as wearing “T-shirts” and “shorts” and “watching football.”200 Humility and authenticity in rural America, then, often require an identity performance that contrasts with urbanized connotations of class elitism and unfamiliar otherness,201 and are also inextricably tied to the core rural tenets of self-reliance202 and gender and sexual norm conformity203 as discussed below.In expressing her discomfort over Chaz Bono’s public statements on the prejudice he suffers as a transgender person, one rural woman nicely illustrated the value that small towns place on community solidarity—and by extension humility and authenticity: “Just be a regular person, go to work, mow the lawn, fish.

Self-RelianceRural individuals often depend on their families and the community for social, and sometimes economic, support.205 Somewhat paradoxically, however, rural communities strongly value independence and self-reliance—the second tenet of rural identity.206 While seemingly in tension, closer inspection reveals that community solidarity and self-reliance work well in tandem. For most rural Americans, independence expressed through self-reliance means hard work. In particular, men are expected to have a job and provide for their families (more on this later).207 Small towns subscribe very much to a pull-oneself-up mentality.208 Community solidarity comes into play here as well in a number of ways. First, the community ideally should give individuals the tools they need to succeed by their own merits: “‘help’ is about letting people work hard enough so that they can make it on their own.”209 The community can be a useful resource for creating and helping people find jobs.210 Second, hard work and the self-reliance that hard work brings confer honor, allowing the worker to identify as a good person and be received in that way by the community.211 Being a good person, as discussed above, is a commonly shared small-town value and a core component of community citizenship. Third, those who work hard and are self-reliant serve as examples and assurances to the community that rural identity is more natural than and perhaps morally superior to urban identity.To make sense of this third point, it is useful to underscore how rural identity and its constituent tenets are formed, at least in part, in opposition to urban identities.212 According to Professor Katherine Cramer, resentment of urban areas is part of rural consciousness.213 People living                                                                                                                      205.

C. Religiously Informed Gender and Sexual Normativity The third major tenet of rural identity could be spliced into multiple subparts or even other tenets. Instead, this Article pours religiosity, gender conformity, and heterosexuality into a single pillar because of the interconnected way in which these components work. Religion is the foundational material from which all else is built.Simply put, the “church is often the center of the rural community.”227On average, rural residents are more religious than their urban counterparts.228 Moreover, because individual rural areas see little in-migration and are home to many families with deep genealogical roots, each place tends to be religiously as well as racially homogenous.229 Most rural communities tend to be Christian, and rural Southern states include more fundamentalist strains of Christianity than do others parts ofAmerica.230 Churchgoing in rural communities is thus a core                                                                                                                      224.

Christianity does much good in the world, and many good people areChristians. However, two related aspects of Christianity tend to shape rural environments, and their effects can make life particularly difficult for many women and LGBTQ people who live in rural areas. In short, rural Christianity tends to be conservative and traditional with regard togender and sexuality.232 It largely promotes ideas such as: sex is a God-given trait determined at birth; gender differences are natural, rigid, and have widely-understood meanings; and sexuality is primarily about procreation and should be channeled into a marital relationship between one man and one woman.233 These religious beliefs are not uniquely rural, of course, but they guide rural life in a unique way because they are fundamental parts of the community’s social and cultural fabric.234 These religious beliefs also take on a secular nature in that they function alongside other factors contributing to rural community solidarity—such as lack of diversity, geographic and social insularity, and popular calls for sameness and blending in—to reinforce and even harden pre-existing attitudes about sex, gender, and sexuality.235In small towns, gender relations are still highly patriarchal.236 This patriarchal ideology and the primacy it gives to men and male power codes rural spaces as highly masculine.237 Although rural women have increasingly entered the workforce in the last few decades,238 the ideology of male dominance and separate male and female roles at work                                                                                                                      231. “Religious fundamentalism and an active churchgoing population in many small rural communities may . . . impose strong moral proscriptions against nonmarital sexual activity.” Daniel T.

Family is one of the most important things in rural communities because it provides the foundation for being seen as a good person with deep ties to the community and the church.255                                                                                                                     248.

Families also help in the production and enforcement of gender norms, and conforming to those gender norms is part of what community solidarity requires. 256In many rural areas, a sharp division still exists between men’s and women’s roles within the family, and declining economic circumstances may exacerbate the importance of those roles.257 Further, and to state the obvious, sex between men and women often results in procreation. Heterosexuality is thus literally key to traditional family formation, and symbolically key to how men and women should correctly perform masculinity and femininity.258 Consequently, gays and lesbians are more clearly marked in rural areas as gender nonconforming.259 Finally, churches teach that sex outside of marriage and homosexuality are sinful.260 Many people believe that homosexuality is particularly threatening because they see it as a selfish “choice” that eschews family obligations in favor of individual pleasure.261Professors Naomi Cahn and Julie Carbone identify a “red family paradigm,” which is more likely to be religious and rural,262 and which positions marriage as the most important institution.263 According to the red family model, “marriage channels sexuality, connects it to childrearing, and continues to be the foundation for community life in                                                                                                                      AND THE BOYS 102, 107 (2000) (identifying “family” as what working-class people value most in life).256.

It places greater importance for relationship stability on the presence of a biological father and mother, their modeling of complementary masculine and feminine roles, and the exclusivity of their relationship.”265 Traditional family formation, then, provides opportunities to perform clearly defined gender roles, steer sexuality into a morally sanctioned union, perform heterosexuality according to community solidarity demands and religious teachings, and identify a common threat in homosexuality. III. RURAL RESENTMENTIn November of 2016, Donald Trump stunned the world by winning the U.S. presidential election. Trump rode a populist wave fueled by economic and cultural anxieties in America’s rural working class. Exit polls showed that sixty-two percent of rural voters chose Trump, while only thirty-five percent of urban voters did so.266 My rural home state of West Virginia voted for Trump by a greater margin than “any other state.”267Leading up to and since the 2016 election, the nation has spent considerable time and energy dissecting Donald Trump’s working-class and predominately rural base. J.D. Vance discusses how factory closings and the loss of good, well-paying jobs in rural America “left behind” communities of truly disadvantaged and desperate poor people with few resources and support.268 The first episode of the temporarily successful2018 Roseanne reboot highlights the economic optimism that Trump offered his downtrodden supporters through the eyes of blue-collar matriarch Roseanne Conner, who, while fighting with her anti-Trump sister Jackie, states with exasperation, “[h]e talked about jobs.”269Professor Joan Williams likewise focuses on the economic hardships of rural working-class whites, but she suggests that more than economic                                                                                                                      264.

Professor Robert Wuthnow characterizes rural America’s “moral outrage” as two things: (1) fear that small-town values are disappearing, and (2) anger that small-town values are “under siege” because of outside forces seeking to change culture broadly.271 Katherine Cramer identifies three similar components in what she calls “rural consciousness”: (1) feelings of rural powerlessness to make meaningful change, (2) feelings that rural areas are distinct from urban areas “in their culture and lifestyle (and that these differences are not respected),” and (3) feelings that rural areas do not get their fair share of resources.272 Thomas Frank theorizes that rural Americans feel victimized, marginalized, and persecuted by arrogant elites who have all the power and do not like or understand rural cultures.273 Nancy Isenberg argues that “Make America Great Again,” Donald Trump’s campaign slogan, is essentially a dog-whistle to rural Americans who feel that their hard work is not rewarded, and who resent federal and state governments for giving special rights and handouts to undeserving minorities.274 And Professor Arlie Russell Hochschild, after spending years immersed in and studying one southern rural community, finds that rural America “seeks release from liberal notions of what they should feel—happy for the gay newlywed, sad at the plight of the Syrian refugee, unresentful about paying taxes.”275These and other social science sources suggest that many people who live in rural areas share a strong collective identity rooted in place. This Article organizes this shared identity, or culture, into three core tenets, as discussed above: community solidarity, self-reliance, and compliance with religiously informed gender and sexual norms. These core tenets converge as a broad cultural tableau from which rural inhabitants pull to shape their perceptions of both themselves and the communities in which they live. These tenets also fuel the growing resentment that rural America feels toward state and federal laws, regulations, and spendingthat purport to protect and help certain groups.276                                                                                                                     270.

Rural Identity Versus LGBTQ Identities This Part lays the foundation for understanding why much of rural America resents LGBTQ rights. This Article suggests that the seeds of resentment grow due to the ways in which LGBTQ identities conflict with the three core tenets of rural identity. Moreover, an embedded part of that conflict stems from the widely shared yet incorrect belief that LGBTQ people and identities are largely urban phenomena.277LGBTQ identities conflict in multiple ways with the tenet of rural community solidarity and the related tenet of religiously informed gender and sexual normativity.278 The most important aspect of community solidarity is assimilation to community norms by virtue of “being the same” as everyone else in the community and avoiding standing out.279Being the same as everyone else, in turn, tends to require community members to exercise humility, be genuine and authentic, and be good people. Heterosexuality and gender normativity are presumptively natural and therefore authentic.280 Heterosexuality as expressed by getting married to a different-sexed person and having children allows individuals to showcase traditional family values and abide by religiousteachings, all of which augment a person’s status as good.281When people in small towns come out and openly identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, the act of coming out is a direct affront to the myth of community sameness, and a clear violation of religiously informed sexuality norms that require heterosexuality. The act of coming out is a declaration of sexual difference to the world, which inherently breaks rules of sameness and blending in.282 Many straight rural people                                                                                                                      277.

Many queer people simply lead quiet, discrete lives in small towns.286 They may identify as gay, for example, but they largely live a “public secret” in which they privately participate in gay life and do not openly discuss it.287 Rural LGBTQ people often explain that their silence around their sexual orientation or gender identity permits tacit acceptance, even as the community denounces LGBTQ identities and queer people as a whole.288 Indeed, rural straight people are largely okay with “good gays” who do not “draw                                                                                                                      THE METROPOLIS 182, 193 (Richard Phillips et al. eds., 2000) (explaining that claiming a queer identity in rural areas is difficult due to heteronormative demands for sameness).283.

The legalization of same-sex marriage in all fifty states has complicated the relationship between queer identity and rural community solidarity. When the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges held that same-sex marriage bans violate the U.S. Constitution, rural communities were suddenly required by law to accept public manifestations of gay, lesbian, and bisexual identities in the form of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages. 292 Obergefell grants gay individuals the “special right” to be publicly different in rural communities that demand sameness. Obergefellencourages gay individuals to both ask and tell in defiance of community solidarity values that counsel silent obedience to the religiously informed norms of heterosexuality and gender conformity. From the perspective of small-town Americans, Obergefell is a particularly egregious example of how rural identity is overlooked and maligned in that nine unelected people—who live and work in Washington D.C. and were educated at Ivy League schools—have now dictated to rural citizens how they must act and, by implication, how they must think and feel. The Supreme Court disrupted the delicate balance between the gay public secret and rural community solidarity, fanning the flames of a long-burning fire over identity recognition. Beyond the mere claiming of queer identity as a direct marker of difference, rural areas also perceive LGBTQ identities as violative of the values that comprise community solidarity due to the urban connotations of LGBTQ issues and people. Historically, cities served as both imagined and real places where same-sex interested people and gender nonconformists could flee from hostile hometowns, come out, and form communities with other queer people.293 The sheer size of cities makes them likelier than small towns to host a critical mass of other like-minded people, and the anonymity of cities offers the freedom to explore sexuality and gender differences in ways unimaginable under watchful                                                                                                                      289.

Because rural LGBTQ people tend to be less out and open than their urban counterparts, rural Americans are primarily exposed via media to more visible urban iterations of LGBTQ people and culture.297 Simply put, “media play a central role in circulating the meaning of ‘LGBT’ identities,”298 and this meaning is widely received and understood.299 Urban gay “stock characters” have developed and become lodged in the national imagination.300 Those stock characters come loaded with a bevy of stereotypes. “The word on the street is that we look a certain way, dress a certain way, think a certain way, [and]consume a certain way.”301 Take Pride for example: both straight and queer rural people point to Pride parades and celebrations as something “extreme” that urban LGBTQ people participate in.302 The perception of Pride events as extreme comes in part from their “uniquely queer, transgressive, [and] carnivalesque contingents,” including drag queens, porn stars, “dykes on bikes,” and plenty of nearly naked men.303 These are not the kinds of folks who can typically be found in small-townparades because they are in open violation of rural gender and sexuality norms.                                                                                                                     294.

In rural areas, however, activism can be a dirty word.305Activism suggests questioning well-settled norms and calling attention to oneself—exactly the opposite of what community solidarity requires. Activism also conflicts with the rural identity tenet of self-reliance because activism often involves demands for help or protection from federal, state, or local governments. But in rural consciousness, hard work leads to dignity and respect, not appeals to the government for a handout.306Further, effective activism often takes time (off from work) and money, and thus “[w]orking-class and poor gay people are not the population to whom the gay and lesbian movement’s events, newspapers, magazines, enterprises, and efforts at political mobilization are aimed.”307In this way, the stereotype of the urban LGBTQ activist bleeds into the stereotype that gay people are wealthy.308 The rural line of thinking then goes something like this: if queer people can afford to go the gym, spend money in bars, take exotic vacations, buy stylish clothes and accessories, consume LGBTQ media, and donate both time and money to political campaigns and causes,309 then how are they so oppressed? By contrast, rural areas are financially struggling and have little free time or tangible resources to buy and do things that are not necessities.310 To poor rural ears, calls to end oppression sound in many ways like a request for “special rights” by already privileged queer people.311                                                                                                                     304.

First, many rural people—including rural gay people—perceive the urban LGBTQ community and especially urban gay men to be sexually promiscuous and non-monogamous.312 Thatperception is not entirely false: in one 2005–07 study of male same-sex couples living in the San Francisco Bay Area, forty-seven percent reported having some kind of non-monogamous agreement.313 The problem is that gay men in the Bay Area do not represent all gay men, yet media and popular discourse nevertheless tend to generalize and apply their experiences to gay men everywhere.314Second, many rural people—including rural gay people—perceive urban gay men as effeminate.315 Here, at least two other stereotypes work together to help create the effeminacy perception. One stereotype suggests that urban LGBTQ people are part of a creative class that ostensibly cares about culture and aesthetics more than the population at large.316 This stereotype standing alone is not necessarily harmful because it is arguably positive.317 However, a related stereotype suggests that urban gays’ attention to aesthetics leads to an excessive—and, to some, snobbish—interest in fashion, apparel, accessories, and personal grooming.318 Masculinity is highly valued and policed in rural areas, and rural men largely equate things like fashion and shopping with                                                                                                                      312. See, e.g., HOWARD, supra note 288, at 109 (explaining the disconnect between a sexually permissive urban gay culture and rural Mississippians who “clung to a belief in monogamy and to the values of a committed long-term relationship with a single life partner”). 313.

In sum, the visibility of urban LGBTQ people and culture can often emphasize for rural people the perceived excesses of urban queer life and their differences from rural norms. Notably, urban gay stock characters can have a decidedly affluent and freewheeling flavor. When rural inhabitants view representations of urban queerness from afar, they see examples of expendable income spent on unnecessary items and activities, relaxed and even “flamboyant” public gender presentations for both men and women, and laissez-faire attitudes toward sex. In this way, the LGBTQ community can be dismissed as just another subgroup of privileged urban elites who in many ways represent the antithesis of rural identity. B. Of Animus and Resentment Law and society often characterize discrimination against minority groups as motivated by animus. Indeed, the Supreme Court relied on the concept of animus in two important gay rights cases as a rationale for why laws violated the U.S. Constitution. First, in Romer v. Evans, the Court in 1996 struck down Colorado’s Amendment 2 as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.321 The Court inferred animus from the law’s structure and effect; in short, the law imposed a sweeping burden (no anti-discrimination protections) on a small group (lesbians, gays, and bisexuals) without any logical explanation.322 Second, in United States v. Windsor,323 the Court in 2013 struck down section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined “marriage” under federal law as between one man and one woman, as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.324 The Court inferred animus from both DOMA’s structure and effect and found direct evidence of animus in the statute’s text and                                                                                                                      319. See Annes & Redlin, supra note 195, at 282 (discussing how one “effeminate boy” felt anxious about his effeminate characteristics while growing up in a rural town and adopted “typical masculine behavior” and acted like a “real jock” as a result).320.

Instead, it focuses on resentment as a concept related to, and perhaps even part of, animus,330 but nevertheless worthy of separate discussion given the cultural ways in which it motivates widespread rural anti-LGBTQ attitudes and legislative actions. The Oxford Dictionary defines resentment as “[b]itter indignation at having been treated unfairly.”331 Resentment “reflects the sense that the victim of an injury is slighted if the source of injury is allowed to carry on unaffected—or worse yet, to profit.”332 In short, resentment is about                                                                                                                      325.

See, e.g., Russell K. Robinson, Unequal Protection, 68 STAN. L. REV. 151, 186 (2016) (noting that the Court “has never defined animus” and describing competing “‘thick’ and ‘thin’” interpretations of the concept).  328. Pollvogt, supra note 89, at 924. 329. Id. at 926. 330. Russell Robinson notes that the Court often employs a “thin” definition of animus, asking whether some action was motivated by a “bare desire to harm” the group in question. Robinson, supra note 327. The fear and anger that comprise resentment can likewise lead to a desire to harm the source of that fear and anger. The “thick” definition probes more deeply into the biases and stereotypes that support some policy affecting the group in question. Id. Fear and resentment can likewise stem from stereotypes and implicit biases about the source of that fear and anger. 331.

These are the perceived injuries and unfair treatment that unite much of rural America in our current political moment; white rural Americans believe that they are victims, and they resent their victimizers,whom they imagine to be profiting in various ways at their expense.Donald Trump has masterfully weaponized the concept of “unfair treatment”335—repeatedly tapping into the feelings of victimization shared by his predominately rural base. Regarding LGBTQ rights, rural communities and rural people do not necessarily hate all individuals who identify as gay or transgender,336especially those who actually live among them and have deep family ties in the community or follow most of the community solidarity rules.337Accordingly, a thin definition of animus as a “bare desire to harm”338 may not be a perfect fit to describe rural America’s relationship to LGBTQ people. Rather, small towns feel resentment toward the broader concept of gay and transgender equality, and they do so in large part because of the creeping presence of outside forces who are now telling rural people that they must accept LGBTQ people while disregarding the clash between rural identity and urban-infused LGBTQ identities.Justice Scalia subtly tapped into the cultural themes of rural identity and resentment in his Lawrence v. Texas339 dissent. Lawrence is one of the Supreme Court’s most important gay rights decisions because the majority held that states cannot criminalize private consensual sex between two unrelated adults.340 As Justice O’Conner noted in her concurrence, criminalization of sodomy made “homosexuals unequal in                                                                                                                      333.

Evans dissent,346 wherein he characterized “tolerant Coloradans” seeking to “preserve traditional sexual mores” as victims of “a politically powerful” gay minority group.347 In both cases, Scalia essentially accepted conservative arguments that gays are seeking “special rights” that they do not need because they already have resources and elite culture on their side.348 Conservatives can make persuasive arguments like this because of the specific ways in which LGBTQ identities and culture have been urbanized: if gay and trans people are largely features of big cities who defy rural community solidarity values of humility, authenticity, sexual conservatism, and gender conformity, and if gay and trans people have accumulated wealth and acceptance in these big cities, then why are rural Americans being asked to change who they are to accommodate people so fundamentally at odds with rural identity and                                                                                                                      341.

Simply put, rural Americans feel that they are falling behind while queer people are getting ahead at rural Americans’ expense. For many people in small towns, Obergefell was thefinal straw because the Supreme Court took from rural Americans one of the last things they felt they had left:349 the religiously informed legal commitment to the sanctity and preciousness of traditional marriage between one man and one woman.350National and local conservative activists, groups, and politicians have tapped into the resentment that much of rural America feels toward gay and transgender progress. Modern conservatives have appropriated the concepts of injury and unfair treatment that propelled LGBTQ legal victories in the past to now cast rural Americans and Christians as the real victims.351 If a “bare desire to harm” gays and trans people historically motivated anti-LGBTQ policies, resentment is the shield and sword that conservatives use today to protect themselves from LGBTQ progress.  C. Anti-LGBTQ Resentment at the State and Local LevelState and local anti-LGBTQ legislation serve as two close-to-home mechanisms that rural communities can use to shield themselves from,and fight back against, the perceived injustice of being told what to do by outsiders who do not consider their needs, wants, and collective rural identity.352 The Supreme Court’s 2015 pro-same-sex marriage decision in Obergefell seemingly sparked a legislative fury. The state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, Cathryn Oakley, recently commented that the three years following the marriage equality decision ushered in an “onslaught” of anti-LGBTQ legislation.353 In 2016, pro-LGBTQ activists identified over 200 newly                                                                                                                      349.

In 2018, at the state level, for example, republican state legislators in Wyoming and South Carolina introduced nearly identical bills referring to same-sex marriages as “parody marriages” and prohibiting state-sponsored recognition of such parody marriages.357 At the local level, in Starkville, Mississippi (population 25,352),358 the local governing Board in 2018 denied a request for a special permit to hold the town’s first Pride parade.359 The Board had not denied a special permit request in years, and it did not explain why it denied this request.360 Two residents spoke against the Pride parade at a town meeting, and one implored the Board to “not turn our city into a sin city.”361 As another example, in Portland, Tennessee (population 12,697362), the local governing Board in 2017 unanimously voted to proceed toward amending an existing ordinance dealing with adult-oriented businesses to include “male or female impersonators.”363 The amended ordinance would effectively prohibit                                                                                                                      354.

For example, some states have parroted North Carolina’s controversial HB2 by attempting to prohibit localities from enacting anti-discrimination protections which go further than existing state law. In February 2015, Arkansas enacted a law that prohibits any “county, municipality[,] or other political subdivision of the state” from adopting any law that “creates a protected classification or prohibits discrimination on a basis not contained in state law.”368 Arkansas state law does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.369Republican state senator Bart Hester from Cave Springs, Arkansas (population 3,811370) introduced the bill, explaining that state legislation is necessary to respond to Fayetteville’s “unfair” attempts to pass pro-LGBTQ anti-discrimination ordinances.371 In February 2017, the Arkansas Supreme Court struck down Fayetteville’s pro-LGBTQ ordinance as a violation of state law.372 Like in Arkansas, legislators in                                                                                                                      364.

Much of the proposed and enacted legislation flows directly from the Supreme Court’s marriage equality decision, evidenced by the wedding-specific services that the bills target: “bakers, caterers, florists, calligraphers, photographers, videographers, and venues,” for example.377 Other legal developments paint in much broader strokes, granting special protection to religious beliefs regarding housing, health care, and child welfare services.378 Since Obergefell, and as of July 2018, ten mostly rural states have enacted some new form of religious freedom legislation, presumably in response to recent LGBTQ legal victories: Alabama,Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.379For queer people, perhaps the most tangibly harmful iterations of religious freedom laws deal with child welfare. In 2018, for example, Kansas and Oklahoma both enacted laws that legally allow any state-                                                                                                                     Arkansas, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/fayetteville cityarkansas/PST045217 [https://perma.cc/AMM6-DKUG].373.

Religious objections to gay and trans rights thrive in cities,too. Religious freedom claims do, however, neatly align with core tenets of rural identity, particularly as those claims relate to children and family. For most of rural America, children are the center of a family unit structured around the marital relationship of one woman and one man. As Joan Williams explains, respect for traditional family values, especially monogamous heterosexuality, is a key part of working-class (rural) identities, yet liberals and the “elite class” now derive honor from embracing same-sex marriage and alternative sexualities.383 For rural America in particular, then, same-sex marriage and other gains in LGBTQ equality signal disrespect, and disrespect stokes resentment. In the summer of 2015, Kim Davis, an elected county clerk in Rowan County, Kentucky (population 24,517384), famously refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell decision.385 Davis subsequently went to jail for defying a court order to issue the licenses386 and in the process became a highly visible martyr for the conservative cause and a symbol of rural victimization.                                                                                                                      380.

They also send a punitive message about the perils of seeking “special rights” based on different and otherized identities tied to sexuality or gender. In this way, local and state anti-LGBTQ actions can serve as vessels for outward manifestations of rural identity and expressions of rural citizens’ deeply held feelings of victimization. D. Masterpiece Cakeshop and its Rural Symbolism Conservative activists at the national level have tapped into aspects of rural identity and resentment to channel anti-gay and anti-trans activism into arguments about religious freedom. As Professor Reva Siegel explains, opponents of LGBTQ rights have mobilized to seek exemptions from “the heavy hand of the law,” speaking as “religious minorities asserting full-throated objections to same-sex marriage that before Obergefell they asserted as legislative majorities.”388 The same-sex marriage victory for gay and bisexual people propelled the victimhood narrative on the right, with conservatives now increasingly fighting back against accusations that they are bigoted for opposing marriage equality. The litigation leading to the Supreme Court’s 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop decision directly implicates the tension between religious freedom and LGBTQ inclusive anti-discrimination laws.389 While it never explicitly mentions geography, Masterpiece Cakeshop serves as a nationalized symbol of the rural–urban divide undergirding much of the anti-LGBTQ activism today. On July 19, 2012, Charlie Craig and David Mullins visited Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Colorado and asked the owner, Jack                                                                                                                      387. For instance, the Arkansas Supreme Court held that a state law excluding a non-biological parent in a same-sex relationship from a child’s birth certificate, while simultaneously requiring a non-biological parent in a different-sex relationship to be included on a child’s birth certificate, did not violate the Obergefell mandate.

And to me it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to—to use their religion to hurt others.402Through a pro-LGBTQ rights lens, the commissioner’s comments about how religion has historically been used to harm others might seem relatively innocuous and even obvious. From American singer and political activist Anita Bryant’s 1977 religious crusade to overturn a pro-gay anti-discrimination ordinance in Dade County, Florida,403 to ubiquitous chants of “Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” at anti-LGBTQ rallies,404 queer people deeply understand the ways in which religion can be used to harm them. Justice Kennedy did not view these comments through a pro-LGBTQ rights lens, however. Instead, he sympathized with a Christian “victim,” characterizing this comment as “disparag[ing]” of Phillips’s religious beliefs.405 In this way, Justice Kennedy echoed Justice Scalia’s Lawrence and Romer concerns for average Americans who have seemingly lost the culture war to special gay interests. Indeed, several amicus curiae expressed similar sentiments about identity and victimization in briefs supporting Phillips. As one put it:Many Christians, like Petitioner Jack Phillips, find their identity in Jesus Christ and the ageless, sacred tenets of His Word memorialized in the Holy Bible. For followers of Jesus Christ, adhering to His commands is the most personal and central choice to define their individual dignity and autonomy.

There can be no doubt that the right of personal identity protects against government authorities who use public policy to persecute, oppress, and discriminate against Christians and their religious identity.406Masterpiece Cakeshop is not explicitly about place, but place is quietly present. The tension between LGBTQ rights and religious freedom represents the latest iteration of a longstanding culture war that is heavily fought on geographic lines. Because rural identity’s core tenets are connected in various ways to Christianity, and because most of rural America is politically conservative, rural identity and resentment serve as useful pieces of armor for conservative soldiers in the culture war.407Federal and state anti-discrimination laws—i.e., legislation stemming primarily from progressive urban centers—that prohibit individual florists and wedding planners, for example, from discriminating againstsame-sex couples are powerful examples of how outsiders force rural communities and religious dissenters to tolerate and even promote public displays of same-sex difference that contradict their values and signal disrespect for their way of life. CONCLUSIONThis Article is in some ways a counter-narrative to the linear assumption of LGBTQ progress. While LGBTQ rights have indeed moved forward in recent years, a stubborn resistance remains and may even be growing in some corners—particularly in white rural America. Since Obergefell, local and state legislatures in conservative and mostly rural states have proposed and passed hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills. Increasingly popular religious freedom rhetoric taps into traits and anxieties characteristic of white rural culture. For these reasons, anti-LGBTQ identity politics may be an overlooked component of Donald Trump’s political rise and eventual election as President of the United States. Remember that candidate Trump picked former Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running-mate, whose major claim to national fame prior to the Vice Presidency was signing and defending, amidst public                                                                                                                      406.

For rural Americans, however, accepting LGBTQ people and rights may require wrestling with and even rejecting parts of their own identity. Rural identity is comprised of at least three core tenets: community solidarity, self-reliance, and religiously informed gender and sexuality conformity. In many ways, these tenets directly conflict with calls for acceptance of LGBTQ difference, especially given the urban connotations of LGBTQ identities. This conflict can signal to rural Americans that their identities are diminishing in importance and are not respected. White rural Americans resent that liberal, largely urban outsiders have been telling them that they must change who they are to accommodate people whom they perceive as unlike them. We should strive to understand and, to the extent possible, respect rural identity. The failure to do so only increases rural feelings of victimization that lead to civil rights backlash more broadly. Understanding and respect, however, do not mean that rural identity and resentment should thwart others’ claims to be free from discrimination. Some of the conflict between rural and LGBTQ identities is fundamentally intractable. For example, it is unlikely that progressives and gay rights activists can change the rural identity tenet anchoring the belief that homosexuality is sinful. For people living in small towns who,                                                                                                                      408.

Similarly, laws that require individuals to house, employ, and serve openly gay and transgender people will perhaps always make many small-town people feel uncomfortable or complicit in sin. At this juncture between rural and LGBTQ identities, gay and trans rights should triumph. On balance, the law should protect the tangible housing and employment needs, and public accommodations access, of queer people over the feelings and beliefs that help to construct rural identity. At other points, however, the gulf between rural and LGBTQ identities is narrower. One important mechanism for softening rural opposition to LGBTQ equality is to draw more attention to the reality that small towns are home for queer people, too. As I have illustrated in previous work, many sexual minorities live in small towns either because they cannot leave or because they prefer to stay.413 Many stay by choice precisely because they appreciate and embody most of the core tenets of rural identity. A lesbian in rural Alabama nicely summed up the sentiment: “Folks ride by and wave at you when you are sitting on your porch. I like being involved in community things here. It is easy for me to do that in a small town.”414 To the extent that rural resentment is fueled in part by perceptions that outsider others are getting ahead while small-town Americans are falling behind, targeting the LGBTQ community across the board makes little sense when so many queer people live in rural areas and are just like their blue-collar, hard-working, humble, and good-natured neighbors. Another important mechanism for softening rural opposition to LGBTQ equality is to contest and combat the urban queer stock characters and the stereotypes that comprise them. Big cities are home to many gay and trans people, of course, but the LGBTQ people who live in them are not all white, wealthy, superficial, or unabashedly sexually liberated. Urban gay stock characters simply do not represent the whole community: they occlude the poverty that continues to plague queer people, on average even more than their straight and cisgender counterparts;415 they leave out the many gay and trans people who are                                                                                                                      412.

If rural resentment is fueled in part by the perception that LGBTQ people are monolithically both different and better off than rural people, highlighting how urban queer people are economically and culturally similar to rural Americans could help bridge the divide. Finally, and perhaps most controversially, if we are committed to easing rural opposition to LGBTQ equality, queer activists and advocates may need to resort to assimilation and respectability politics when pushing for social and legal change. This is a controversial strategy because many gay and transgender people are different from most rural Americans—by virtue of their sexual orientation and gender identity, of course, but also in terms of their culture. For example, many gay men arenon-monogamous; many gay and transgender people have rejected religion; many queer people do cast off gender norms of presentation and style; many LGBTQ people are immersed in popular culture regarding music, cinema, art, and fashion; and the identity marker “queer” is by definition about rejecting the status quo. As Professor Michael Warner warned in the 1990s, arguing for LGBTQ equality by using appeals to sameness alienates, isolates, and even puts at risk those among us whocannot or do not want to be just like everyone else.418 But as Mary Gray explained after conducting an extensive multi-year ethnography in rural Appalachia, small-town belonging does not turn “on appeals to difference deserving equal respect,”419 and in fact highlighting queer difference can “come at a cost.”420 Still, it is unclear how far assimilation and respectability politics can take us. After all, it was gays’ assimilative entry into the institution of marriage—a conservative institution rife with patriarchal and heteronormative meaning—that seemingly sparked much of the modern rural and conservative backlash.

    "abstract": "In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges settled a decades-long national debate over the legality of same-sex marriage. Since Obergefell, however, local and state legislatures in conservative and mostly rural states have proposed and passed hundreds of anti-LGBTQ bills. Obergefell may have ended the legal debate over same-sex marriage, but it did not resolve the cultural divide. Many rural Americans, especially in predominately white communities, feel that they are under attack. Judicial opinions and legislation protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination are serious threats to rural dwellers because they conflict with several core tenets of rural identity: community solidarity, self-reliance, and compliance with religiously informed gender and sexual norms. This conflict is amplified by the relative invisibility of gay and transgender people who live in rural areas, and the predominantly urban media representations of gay and transgender people. In several respects, the conflict is merely perceived and is not real. It is at these junctures of perceived conflict that we can draw important lessons for bridging the cultural divide, thereby protecting LGBTQ people across geographic spaces.\nThis Article examines the sources and modern manifestations of rural LGBTQ resentment to provide foundational insights for the ongoing fight to protect all vulnerable minorities. Pro-LGBTQ legislation and judicial opinions symbolize a changing America in which white rural inhabitants see their identities disappeqaring, devalued, and disrespected. The left, popularly represented in rural America as a group of urban elites, characterizes anti-LGBTQ views a bigoted, and many people in small towns feel victimized by this criticism. Drawing on a robust body of social science research, this Article suggests that these feelings of victimization lead to resentment when outside forces, like federal judges and state and big-city legislators, tell rural Americans how to act, think, and feel. Rural Americans resent  undeserving  minorities who have gained rights and recognition, in contrasts to the identities of, and at the perceived expense of, white, straight, working-class prestige. They resent that liberal, largely urban outsiders are telling them that they must change who they are to accomodate people they perceive as unlike them. Opposing LGBTQ rights is thus one mechanism to protect and assert rural identity. It is important to unearth and pay attention to white rural anti-LGBTQ resentment in the post-Obergefell era because it is part of a larger force animating conservation politics across the United States",
