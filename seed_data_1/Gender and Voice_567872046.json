GENDER AND VOICE  MAIA GARBRANDT  HONORS PROJECT   Submitted to the Honors College at Bowling Green State University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for graduation with  UNIVERSITY HONORS   APRIL 18th, 2023     Advised by:  Jason Whitfield, Ph.D., Communication Sciences & Disorders  Jeanelle Sears, Ph.D., Social Work  Abstract Gender dysphoria is a psychological condition characterized by distress or discomfort because of a disparity between a person's gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. The project’s goal was to find the relationship between voice and gender dysphoria using a case study approach with a small group of transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender fluid individuals using quantitative data and informal qualitative analysis. Four participants completed quantitative surveys that assessed their voice-related quality of life, and their speech was analyzed. In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted to contextualize participants' experiences with their voices and gender dysphoria. According to the findings and data analysis, participants with higher levels of voice-related gender dysphoria reported more negative impacts on their quality of life, and this was especially prevalent in the social-emotional domain for some participants. Acoustic analyses showed that some participants' mean fundamental frequencies (F0) were higher than the average for their self-identified gender, while others' F0s were in the expected range. The qualitative analysis of the interviews gave insight into the participants' experiences, which emphasized the importance of personal identity and societal expectations of voice and gender dysphoria. Overall, the finding suggests that voice-related gender dysphoria is a complex experience that needs an understanding of individual experiences as they walk through life.          Introduction Vocal Acoustics and the Impact of Sex Hormones  There are several features of vocal acoustics that sex hormones can influence, such as fundamental frequency and pitch. Fundamental frequency (F0) and pitch can be determined by the rate of vocal fold vibration and the mass of the vocal folds. Sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen can influence the maintenance and development of the vocal fold tissue during puberty. This can affect the perception of pitch and the F0 due to the change of mass of the vocal folds. Many studies about voice and the effect of sex hormones have shown that there are significant differences in the mass of vocal folds between female-sounding and male-sounding voices. Male-sounding voices tend to have heavier and longer vocal folds, whereas female-sounding voices have shorter and lighter vocal folds, resulting in the difference of F0 (Titze, I. R. 1994). Hormonal fluctuations that happen during puberty and beyond can influence changes in vocal pitch. For individuals whose sex is female, during the menstrual cycle, the estrogen levels will fluctuate, which can change the stiffness and mass of the vocal folds, resulting in a change of F0 (Abdelli-Beruh & Ternström, 2011). For individuals whose sex is male, testosterone can be linked to changes in the vocal pitch, as higher levels of testosterone can result in a lower F0 (Pisanski et al., 2016). Understanding the relationship between sex hormones and their influences on the perception of pitch can help us understand the importance of the biological factors that come into play when studying vocal pitch and sex differences in voice. Gender Dysphoria  For many individuals who identify as transgender or non-binary, their voice could be an impactful factor in their levels of gender dysphoria and the quality of life they experience. Gender dysphoria is when an individual experiences a sense of discomfort because there is a mismatch experience between their biological sex and the gender they identify with. Many aspects can affect the levels of gender dysphoria an individual can experience. In some cases, individuals who experience gender dysphoria can exhibit internalizing behaviors, which can lead to social withdrawal and isolation (Skagerberg et al., 2013). Despite the feelings of gender dysphoria being so impactful in the lives of individuals who identify as transgender and nonbinary, the conversation remains scant in the world of voice. Voice-Related Gender Dysphoria  Gender dysphoria related to voice is an occurrence that happens to many people who identify as non-binary or transgender. Voice is a crucial factor in gender perception and gender expression. When verbal communication occurs, gender cues occur during social interactions. In some patriarchal societies, acoustic predictors of speech can influence gender perception by indicating femininity or masculinity in the voice (Hardy et al., 2016). Because the perception of voice is crucial to gender identification within communication, closing this gap can lead to a societal acceptance of one’s transition into the gender they identify with. For individuals going through the transition process, the uneasiness of gender dysphoria may improve as they go through changes that affirm their gender. However, this process can take years, and their socioeconomic situation may affect the time it takes to complete their transition. During the transitional period and after, transgender and non-binary individuals will experience psychological and physical challenges that come from trying to gain access to societal acceptance of their gender (Şirin et al., 2019). The gender dysphoria they can experience can influence their quality of life negatively. This intense dysphoria can cause suffering, stress, and social isolation. Purpose The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship between gender dysphoria and voice in individuals who identify as non-binary or transgender. The goal is to better understand how voice and speech characteristics associated with gender identity affect gender dysphoria. This study is important because it aims to address an area that has been overlooked in discussions about gender dysphoria - the role of voice. By studying the relationship between gender dysphoria and voice, the investigators of this study hope to gain insight into how they can help individuals with gender dysphoria find a voice that they feel fits their identity. This could lead to better mental health outcomes for those affected by gender dysphoria.  Method Participants  There were four participants, aged 19 to 22. Three of the participants were white, while one was Hispanic. Two of the participants identified as genderfluid or gender non-conforming, and one transgender male and one transgender female also participated in this study. All data collection protocols were approved by the BGSU IRB. Protocol After being contacted by prospective participants, a member of the researcher team reached  out and described to study protocols to the prospective participants via email. The researcher shared the informed consent form with the prospective participants and indicated that to participate in the study, they would need to identify 3 to 4 people in popular culture who felt their voices aligned with how they would like to be perceived. Once they agreed, prospective participants were asked to bring the links to audio or video recordings of each exemplar person that were publically available online, such as interviews, speeches, podcasts, etc., from platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, etc. During the study, the participants were then asked to complete a set of standing speaking tasks. The entire session was recorded using a microphone and digital audio recorder, and the duration of the session did not exceed 90 minutes (about one and a half hours).  Questionnaires Following informed consent, participants completed a demographic questionnaire and two scales. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire comprising questions about Speech/Language/Hearing, general health, and demographic characteristics. Then, they completed two standardized questionnaires. Participants completed the Voice-related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) measure, which is a 10-item scale designed to capture self-reported physical and social-emotional impacts of voice problems (Hogikyan, 2004). The scale has been used in numerous studies of patients with voice disorders and is considered a well-established instrument in voice assessment. The scale included items that measure various aspects of voice-related quality of life, such as the impact of voice on communication, social interactions, and overall well-being. The responses to the VRQOL scale were used to gather data on participants' self-perceived voice and speech quality and informed subsequent interview questions related to participants' perceptions of their voice and speech characteristics. Table 1 shows the items included in the V-RQOL that are rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1 = None, not a problem; 2 = A small amount; 3 = A moderate (medium) amount; 4 = A lot; 5 = Problem is as \"bad as it can be.\").  Table 1 Items on the Voice-Related Quality of Life scale. Item Question 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I have trouble speaking loudly or being heard in noisy situations. I run out of air and need to take frequent breaths when talking. I sometimes do not know what will come out when I begin speaking. I am sometimes anxious or frustrated because of my voice. I sometimes get depressed because of my voice. I have trouble using the telephone because of my voice. I have trouble doing my job or practicing my profession because of my voice. I avoid going out socially because of my voice I have to repeat myself to be understood. I have become less outgoing because of my voice.   Next, participants completed the Transgender Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (TSEQ), which was adapted from the Trans Care Project. This scale includes 30 times that are scored on a five-point Likert scale that asks respondents to indicate how frequently they have these experiences (0=Never 1=Never 2=Sometimes 3=Almost always 4=Always). Table 2 lists the thirty items of the TSEQ.   Table 2  Items on the Transgender Self-Evaluation Questionnaire.

A second tabletop microphone was used to record the researcher who conducted the interview. Both microphones were recorded onto solid-state media using an 8-channel recorder (Zoom F8 Multitrack Field Recorder). Once the levels were set, the researcher conducted an interview using a series of questions related to the participant's perceptions of their voice and speech. These questions listed in Appendix A were developed from items on the V-RQOL and the TSEQ to inform the quantitative ratings given on the two scales. The interview was semi-structured in format, and the researcher followed the participant's lead and used the set of interview questions as a guide. Follow-up questions were used to allow the participants to clarify and elaborate on their responses.  Appendix A Interview Questions Item Question 1 2  3  4 5 6 7 8  How does your voice affect your day-to-day life? Are there any other aspects of your voice speech or communication that impact your day-to-day life? How does your voice and your perception of your voice affect communication in your personal life? How does your voice and your perception of your voice affect your social life? How does your voice affect you in professional or more formal settings? How does the perception of your voice impact or relate to your self-image or identity? Do you feel as if your voice portrays the way you would like to be perceived? If anything, what would you change about your voice or speech or communication?  Speaking Tasks Participants were then asked to read a standard reading passage (the rainbow passage) and complete an extemporaneous speech task. First, participants were asked to read a version of the Rainbow passage that had been modified to be more inclusive aloud (Dietsch et al., 2023). Next, participants were asked to talk about two self-selected topics for 2 to 3 minutes each. They were given a list of example topics to choose from. These speech samples were recorded.  Exemplar Speaking Samples  Finally, the researcher asked the participant to share the three to four media clips with exemplar talkers they identified before the data collection session. All four participants identified three exemplar talkers from popular media who they wanted to sound like. The researcher recorded the URL links and confirmed that they were accurate and working.  Acoustic Analysis  Acoustic analyses were performed offline for the reading and monologue samples produced by each participant and excerpts of the media clips of the exemplar speaker they identified. For the speech samples produced by the participants, each file was segmented using PRAAT. The reading passage in the speech sample was identified by scrolling through the file, and the full reading passage was highlighted by clicking and dragging. Next, the \"File > Extract Selected Sound (time from 0)\" option was selected to create a new file in the Praat Objects list, which was then renamed. Subsequently, the renamed file was selected in the Praat Object Window, and the second channel was extracted.   To record the excerpts from the exemplary talkers, the researcher navigated to the links provided by the participants. After examining the media clip, the research identified a segment that was between 40 sec and 2 min in duration during which the individual was talking, and there was no background noise. Once a segment was identified, the researcher recorded the audio stream using Audacity. For this process, the recording input was set to the stereo mix of the sound card of the computer, meaning that the audio was directly recorded from the computer’s sound card. The file was saved as a .wav file for later analysis.  Fundamental frequency (F0) contours were extracted from each file. For this analysis, the researcher selected \"View & Edit\" on the left menu in Praat which opened a waveform and spectrogram. To perform the pitch analysis, the researcher selected \"Show Pulses\" under the “Pulses\" item located on the top menu. This process performed an automatic acoustic analysis that marked each cycle of vocal fold vibration in the waveform. Then, the researcher selected \"Show Pitch\" under the “Pitch” menu item. The researcher then zoomed into a section of the speech sample and adjusted the pitch tracking settings to maximize the f0 tracking algorithm. The \"Cross-correlation\" method was used, and the pitch range was adjusted for each talker by visually evaluating the validity of the pitch trace and pulse detection algorithm. Once optimized, the pitch contour for the entire sample was saved to a text file.  Analytic Approach   For this investigation, I took a case study approach. First, the demographic information of each talker is presented and summarized, including the raw score on the V-RQOL and TSEQ. Next, the F0 distributions of the speech sample were visually compared to the exemplar talkers they identified for each participant. Finally, the F0 patterns were interpreted with respect to their degree of voice-related gender dysphoria as measured by the TSEQ and the V-RQOL. Responses from the interview were summarized using an informal thematic analysis to contextualize the data and provide a deeper understanding of their lived experiences with gender and voice.     Results The findings of Table 1 look at the Praat system's fundamental frequency (F0), F0 standard deviation (f0SD), and speech time. The study looked at these measurements during reading and conversational monologues for four subjects (ID 1001–1004) and the settings for each participant's minimum and maximum pitch. The findings showed that each participant's reading and monologue speech patterns differed in terms of F0, f0SD, and duration. In contrast to their mean F0 of 137.34 Hz during the monologue, ID 1001's mean F0 during reading was 142.06 Hz. Also, compared to their monologue, ID 1001's reading speech was shorter (77 seconds) (52 seconds). The mean F0 for ID 1002 was 204.46 Hz. ID 1002 also had a shorter duration of speech during reading (49 seconds) compared to their monologue (104 seconds). For ID 1003, the mean F0 was 117.8 Hz during reading, which was like their mean F0 of 119.75 Hz during the monologue. The results showed that there were some differences in F0, f0SD, and duration between reading and monologue speech styles for ID 1004. The mean F0 during reading was 112.784 Hz, which was slightly lower than their mean F0 of 115.96 Hz during the monologue. ID 1004 also had a shorter duration of speech during reading (47 seconds) compared to their monologue (140 seconds). In terms of pitch settings, the minimum and maximum values were 30 Hz and 250 Hz.

They were not taking any hormonal therapies that would affect their voice. Their VRQOL raw score was 34, and their TSEQ was 79. For V-RQOL, 8 of 10 items were rated as either a 4 or 5, which indicates they may have a poor voice-related quality of life. The total (standard) overall score was 60 on the VRQOL. The Social-Emotional Domain score was 69, and the Physical Functioning Domain score was 54. For the TSEQ, 66.3% of the items rated as either a 4 or 5, which indicates they may perceive their voice to be a factor of gender dysphoria in everyday life situations. Together these questionnaires indicate the participant is experiencing voice-related gender dysphoria.   Table 4 reports summary statistics monologue except produced by Participant 1001 and the three exemplary voices they identified. Figure 1 shows the distribution of f0 for the reading passage and monologue except produced by Participant 1001 (left pane) and a violin plot of the f0 distribution for Participant 1001 and the three exemplary voices they identified (right pane). As seen in the right side of Figure 1, Participant 1001 exhibited a bimodal f0 frequency distribution, with the first mode centered below 100 Hz and the second centered around 175 Hz. The highest mode and median f0 were higher than the three exemplary voices they identified, which ranged from 104.93 Hz to 124.17 Hz on average. The lower mode, which likely represented vocal fry, was closer to, but slightly lower than, the f0 distributions of the three exemplary voices they identified.    Table 4 [Audio Comparisons for ID 1001]   Monologues Pitch Settings Sample Gender Mean f0 f0SD Duration Min (Hz) Max (Hz) ID 1001 Male 137.34 52.6 52 50 470 Talker 1 Male 104.93 13.24 60 40 165 Talker 2 Male 115.6 19.9 60 40 170 Talker 3 Male 124.17 21.33 55 45 175   Figure 1. Fundamental frequency (F0) distributions for ID 1001. (a) shows histograms of the F0 values extracted from the monologue (top pane) and reading (bottom pane) tasks produced by ID 1001, and (b) shows violin plots and median f0 of the monologues produced by three exemplar talkers (Ex1-Ex3) the participant identified and ID 1001.   Based on these analyses, it is likely that Participant 1001 experiences voice-related gender dysphoria. This is corroborated by the acoustic findings, which indicate the median f0 is significantly higher than the three exemplary voices they identified. Additionally, the bimodal f0 distribution may indicate that they are vocally compensating to produce a vocal pitch that is better aligned with their voice-related gender identity. Thematic summary of the interview responses confirms this experience. During the interview, the participant was asked about the impact of his voice in day-to-day life. The participant responded by stating, \"I hate talking on the phone. It makes me very uncomfortable. If I had to record my voice, I hate that. If I am doing a video with other people, I am usually the cameraman instead of speaking. He was also asked, \" Does your voice affect your social life?\" He responded by saying, \"I am the quietest of my friends.\" A lot of my friends are talkative, so I am more of a listener.\" Finally, he was asked, “Do you feel as if your voice portrays the way you would like to be perceived?\" He responded, \"No. Like I said, I get a lot of ma'ams. I get people who first call me sir, but then when I talk, they apologize then say, \"ma'am.” The thematic findings of the interview can confirm voice-related gender dysphoria because the responses suggest an overall negative experience doing everyday tasks. The participant describes how he feels uncomfortable talking on the phone or in videos which can suggest a lack of confidence in that his voice portrays the way he would like to be perceived, which could cause a level of gender dysphoria related to his voice. Additionally, because of this dysphoria, he may experience limitations such as difficulty participating or communicating in everyday life.  Analysis for ID 1002 Participant 1002 was white, identified as gender non-conforming, and was assigned female at birth. They were not taking any hormonal therapies that would affect their voice. Their VRQOL t raw score was 15, and their TSEQ was 44. For V-RQOL, 9 of 10 items were rated as either a 1 or 2, which indicates their voice may not affect their quality of life. The total (standard) overall score was 13 on the VRQOL. The total score for the Social-Emotional Domain was 13, and the total score for the Physical Functioning Domain was 13. For the TSEQ, 46.6% of the items rated as either a 0 or 1, which indicates their voice may not be a factor of gender dysphoria in everyday life situations. Together these questionnaires indicate the participant is not experiencing voice-related gender dysphoria. Table 5 reports summary statistics monologue excerpt produced by Participant 1002 and the three exemplary voices they identified. Figure 2 shows the distribution of f0 for the reading passage and monologue except produced by Participant 1002 (left panes) and a violin plot of the f0 distribution for Participant 1002 and the three exemplary voices they identified (right pane). As seen in the right side of Figure 2, Participant 1002 exhibited a mode around 125 Hz, higher than the three exemplar voices they identified, ranging from 136.6 Hz to 155.45 Hz. This difference might suggest a cause for the participant's discomfort with their voice.

Based on these analyses, it is unlikely that Participant 1002 experiences a significant amount of voice-related gender dysphoria. This is corroborated by the acoustic findings, which indicate the mean f0 is not significantly higher than the three exemplar voices they identified. Thematic summary of the interview responses confirms this experience. During the interview, when asked, \"How does your voice impact or relate to your self-image or identity?” the participant responded, “It depends on what my voice is doing. I am comfortable with pitch or inflections, but when it gets higher, I am a little uncomfortable. Sometimes it gets higher and clashes with my identity a bit.” During the interview, Participant 1002 had a neutral stance regarding their voice in various life settings. However, they did indicate feeling more at ease when their voice had a deeper tone. The results of the interview, along with the acoustic analysis, suggest that the participant's gender dysphoria levels may be low, but they feel more comfortable with their voice when it sounds more neutral. It is worth noting that the average F0 of a male-sounding voice is 120 Hz, and while the participant provided exemplar talkers whom all identified as female, their voices had a lower pitch regarding the average for female-sounding talkers, which ranged from 165 Hz to 255 Hz. Overall, the analyses suggest that the participant may have a mild level of discomfort with their voice, but the discomfort may not be severe enough to classify it as an elevated level of voice-related gender dysphoria. The voices provided by the participant were lower than average for female-sounding voices, which suggests that the participant may be more comfortable with a lower, more neutral-sounding voice that aligns with their non-conforming gender identity. Analysis for ID 1003 Participant 1003 was white, identified as genderfluid, and was sex assigned at birth as female. They were not taking any hormonal therapies that would affect their voice. Their V-RQOL total raw score was 21, and their TSEQ was 50. For V-RQOL, 7 of 10 items were rated as either a 1 or 2, which indicates their voice may not affect their quality of life. The total (standard) overall score was 28 on the VRQOL. The Social-Emotional Domain score was 25, and the Physical Functioning Domain score was 29. For the TSEQ, 36.6% of the items rated as either a 0 or 1, which indicates their voice may not be a factor of gender dysphoria in everyday life situations. Together these questionnaires indicate the participant is not experiencing voice-related gender dysphoria. Table 6 reports summary statistics monologue excerpt produced by Participant 1003 and the three exemplary voices they identified. Figure 3 shows the distribution of f0 for the reading passage and monologue except produced by Participant 1003 (left panes) and a violin plot of the f0 distribution for Participant 1003 and the three exemplary voices they identified (right pane). As seen in the right side of Figure 3, Participant 1003 exhibited a mode around 125 Hz, which is not significantly higher than the three exemplar voices they identified, with means ranging from 104.68 Hz to 134.34 Hz.

Fundamental frequency (F0) distributions for ID 1003.

Based on the quantitative analysis, it is unlikely that Participant 1003 experiences a significant amount of voice-related gender dysphoria. This is corroborated by the acoustic findings, which indicate the mean f0 is not significantly higher than the three exemplar voices they identified. Participant 1003's mean is about in the middle of the means of the three voices they provided. In fact, the modes of the participant and talkers 2 and 3 all were in a similar range of about 120 Hz. Thematic summary of the interview responses may refute this analysis because the participant expresses a sense of dysphoria due to the inability to have a perceived gender-neutral voice. When asked, \"How does your voice affect your day-to-day life?\" they responded, \"I have noticed sometimes people perceive me as feminine, but depending on the time of day when I speak, it can change how people perceive me.\" Next, they were asked, \"How does your voice and the perception of your voice affect communication in your personal life?” they responded, “Around people, I know very well I will change my voice depending on how I feel, and I will use it as a way to express myself because I am genderfluid.” Finally, they were asked, “Do you feel as if your voice reflects the way you would like to be perceived?\" They responded, \"Not really, because it is hard to have a gender-neutral voice and be perceived as gender-neutral.” Although Participant 1003’s questionnaire responses and acoustic findings may suggest that they do not experience voice-related gender dysphoria, they seem to still experience negative feelings and experiences associated with their voice. The interview analysis may indicate that the participant does experience voice-related gender dysphoria that may relate to the inaccessibility of a gender-neutral voice which could clash with their perceived gender identity.  Analysis for ID 1004 Participant 1004 was white, identified as female, and was assigned male at birth. They were not taking any hormonal therapies that would affect their voice. Their VRQOL total raw score was 31, and their TSEQ was 70. For V-RQOL, 5 of 10 items were rated as either a 4 or a 5, which indicates their voice may affect their quality of life. The total (standard) overall score was 53 on the VRQOL. The Social-Emotional Domain score was 69, and the Physical Functioning Domain score was 42. For the TSEQ, 50% of the items rated as either a 3 or 4, which indicates their voice may be a factor of gender dysphoria in everyday life situations. Together these questionnaires indicate the participant is to be experiencing voice-related gender dysphoria. Table 7 reports summary statistics monologue excerpt produced by Participant 1004 and the three exemplary voices they identified. Figure 4 shows the distribution of f0 for the reading passage and monologue except produced by Participant 1004 (left panes) and a violin plot of the f0 distribution for Participant 1004 and the three exemplary voices they identified (right pane). As seen in the right side of Figure 4, Participant 1004 exhibited a mode around 120 Hz, significantly lower than the three exemplar voices they identified, with means ranging from 133.48 Hz to 174.73 Hz.

Based on these analyses, it is likely that Participant 1004 experiences voice-related gender dysphoria. This is corroborated by the acoustic findings, which indicate the mean f0 is significantly lower than the three exemplar voices they identified. Thematic summary of the interview responses confirms this experience. When asked, \"How does your voice affect your day-to-day life?\" She responded, \"I think that the main way it affects me is worrying how people perceive me, a lot of the time, that is talking on the phone, getting to know someone for the first time, I tend to be a little more self-conscious about it. In those earlier times, I tend to be more cautious.” When asked, “Do you feel as if your voice reflects the way you would like to be perceived?” She responded, “No. I tend to think I have somewhat of a masculine voice, but not completely masculine. I would like to be in the range of feminine. I would enjoy having a higher range and less resonance in my chest and throat.” These answers confirm her discomfort with her voice, and the negative feelings associated with them can indicate gender dysphoria. However, when asked, “How does the perception of your voice impact your self-image or identity?” She responded, “I feel like my voice has been a moving target as my gender identity has changed over the years, and with that, I think my voice has not changed that much. I have not gone through voice training or tried to adjust my voice in any way. I think it has always been a side factor in how I perceive my gender identity.” Even though ID 1004’s analyses suggest a prominent level of voice-related gender dysphoria, this may suggest she does not use her voice as a main factor in how she perceives her gender identity. This is worth noting because even though she may have prominent levels of voice-related gender dysphoria, her voice is not the primary way she perceives her gender. This could be because of her ability to accept her gender identity, other aspects of gender dysphoria that are more prominent, or her personal coping mechanisms.   CONCLUSIONS Investigating the connection between gender dysphoria and voice in people who identify as non-binary or transgender was the goal of this study. The objective is to have a better understanding of how gender dysphoria is impacted by voice related to gender identity. This study is significant because it focuses on the role of voice, a topic that has received little attention in discussions of gender dysphoria. The study included four participants, aged 19 to 22, including three white and one Hispanic individual. Two of the participants identified as genderfluid or gender non-conforming, one as a transgender male, and one as a transgender female. The participants were asked to identify 3-4 people in popular culture or media whose voice and speech characteristics aligned with how they would like to be perceived. They were then asked to bring the audio or video recordings of each exemplar person that was available online. During the study, participants completed a set of standing speaking tasks, and their speech was recorded using a microphone and digital audio recorder. Following informed consent, participants completed a demographic questionnaire and two standardized questionnaires, including the Voice-related Quality of Life (V-RQOL (Voice related Quality of Life) measure and the Transgender Self-Evaluation Questionnaire (TSEQ). After filling out the questionnaires, participants were interviewed by using a series of questions related to their perceptions of their voice and speech. These questions were developed from items on the V-RQOL and the TSEQ, and follow-up questions were used to allow participants to clarify and elaborate on their responses. The study's data collection protocols were approved by the BGSU (Bowling Green State University) IRB, and the entire session was recorded and did not exceed 90 minutes (about one and a half hours).  Participants 1001 and 1004 had the highest levels of voice-related gender dysphoria. This could have to do with the significant differences they had between their voices compared to the exemplar voices they provided. Based on the informal qualitative analysis of the study, both participants experience negative feelings associated with their voices. This could suggest a lower quality of life due to their perceptions of how their voice relates to their identity. It is worth noting that even with a prominent level of voice-related gender dysphoria, gender dysphoria is a spectrum, and some individuals may be more affected by their levels of dysphoria than others. However, a difference in the mean fundamental frequency (F0) of the participant’s voices compared to the ones aligned with their identity could impact the severity of voice-related gender dysphoria.  Based on the analyses, Participant 1002 experiences a mild amount of discomfort due to their voice. However, based on the acoustic analysis and the thematic summary of the interview, they experience a low level of voice-related gender dysphoria. They mentioned that they prefer their voice when it is low in pitch, suggesting that they are more comfortable with a more gender-neutral voice that aligns with their gender identity of nonbinary. The participant provided exemplar voices that were female but with low mean F0s. Based on Participant 1002’s sex at birth being female, they may have an easier time reaching the voices they feel that would align with their gender identity. Overall, Participant 1002 may experience mild discomfort with their voice, but it may not significantly impact their voice-related quality of life or identity. Participant 1003 also displays a unique finding because their quantitative data and the thematic summary of the interview responses contradicted. While the acoustic analysis and the questionnaire suggest that Participant 1003 does not experience a significant level of voice-related gender dysphoria, the analysis of the interview suggests a negative experience in everyday life due to the lack of accessibility of an accepted gender-neutral voice in our culture. This finding highlights the importance of using multiple methods of data analysis that emphasize the individual and their experiences when studying voice-related gender dysphoria. It is worth noting that Participants 1001 and 1004 exhibited VRQOL scores that indicate their voice negatively impacts their quality of life. For both, the impacts were greater in the Social-Emotional Domain than in the Physical Functioning Domain. This could suggest that the distress they experience from their voice-related gender dysphoria impacts their emotional and social well-being. This could indicate that they may feel disconnected or misunderstood in social settings due to their voice rather than their physical functioning hindering their experiences. The study emphasizes how important it is to address both the physical and psychosocial effects of voice-related gender dysphoria because they may have a major influence on an individual’s quality of life.  Future Direction Based on the findings of this study, there are many avenues that could be pursued. One suggestion is that this study could be done on a larger scale that includes more diversity of individuals who identify as transgender, non-binary, or queer. Future findings could help find strategies to better assist voice therapy techniques in lessening voice-related gender dysphoria and improving their client's quality of life. Further research could go in-depth on the psychological effects of voice-related gender dysphoria that, includes the effects on mental health. It may be useful to investigate individuals who have gone through gender-affirming surgeries or hormone therapy to see how they may impact voice-related gender dysphoria. Finally, it may be extremely useful to implement qualitative analyses when working with patients with their voices. Because gender is a spectrum, perceptions of voice can vary from person to person. Qualitative data will be able to provide the complexity an individual may experience because of their perception of their voice. Beyond what was revealed by the acoustic analysis and questionnaire data, the qualitative analysis of the interview in the context of this study assisted in offering additional insight into the experiences of the participants. Furthermore, qualitative analyses can offer a more comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon and support the development of research ideas for the future. Overall, it is important to note gender is a social construct, and societal norms and expectations influence gender dysphoria. It is critical to emphasize that an individual's experiences with gender and gender dysphoria are entirely personal in the context of this study.   References  Abdelli-Beruh, N. B., & Ternström, S.

    "abstract": "Gender dysphoria is a psychological condition characterized by distress or discomfort because of a disparity between a person\\u27s gender identity and the sex assigned at birth. The project’s goal was to find the relationship between voice and gender dysphoria using a case study approach with a small group of transgender, gender non-conforming, and gender fluid individuals using quantitative data and informal qualitative analysis. Four participants completed quantitative surveys that assessed their voice-related quality of life, and their speech was analyzed. In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted to contextualize participants\\u27 experiences with their voices and gender dysphoria. According to the findings and data analysis, participants with higher levels of voice-related gender dysphoria reported more negative impacts on their quality of life, and this was especially prevalent in the social-emotional domain for some participants. Acoustic analyses showed that some participants\\u27 mean fundamental frequencies (F0) were higher than the average for their self-identified gender, while others\\u27 F0s were in the expected range. The qualitative analysis of the interviews gave insight into the participants\\u27 experiences, which emphasized the importance of personal identity and societal expectations of voice and gender dysphoria. Overall, the finding suggests that voice-related gender dysphoria is a complex experience that needs an understanding of individual experiences as they walk through life",
