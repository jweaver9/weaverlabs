I was helped by a hardworking and dedicated committee. This has included:Catherine Butler, Sylvia Kapp, Sarah Zetler, Stuart Gibson, Barbara Hedge, Mime Matthews,Amanda O’Donovan, Claire Mariott, and Claire Stevenson. The work took the form of writing goodpractice guidelines for training and consolidation of clinical psychology practice in HIV and sexualhealth, including a curriculum around sexuality awareness training; sexuality awareness CPDworkshops; a survey of clinical psychology training courses provision in the area of sex andsexuality; a conference; and the editing of a teaching manual for self-reflection around issues ofsexuality (Butler et al., 2009). These guidelines were also part of the vision to facilitate thoughtful,best practice in the controversial area of minority sexuality and gender.Following discussion with Richard Toogood of the Professional Governance Panel of the DCP, theFaculty was asked to work with the Psychology of Sexualities Section in reviewing the status of theseminal APA 2000 Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Clients. A meeting washeld with representatives from the Faculty and Section. From this meeting it was recommendedthat the guidance would be timely; that the US guidance could be updated for the UK, filling ingaps, broadening the scope to other aspects of sexuality and gender; and that in order to make theguidance useful to all psychologists in clinical practice a Working Party with representatives fromrelevant Sections and Divisions would need to be formed. A proposal for the Working Party was put to Nigel Atter from the Professional Practice Board of theBritish Psychological Society. He has guided and encouraged the process ever since. On itsacceptance in April 2007 the core Working Party was formed with further representation invitedfrom the Division of Counselling Psychology, Psychologists Specialising in Psychotherapy,Psychologists working in the Charing Cross Gender Reassignment Clinic, Educational Psychologistsand Forensic Psychologists. I thank these individuals for their drive, lively discussion and belief inthe guidance: Meg Barker, Darren Langdridge, Catherine Butler, Stuart Gibson, Penny Lenihan,Roshan das Nair, and Christina Richards. Other contributors to the writing have included PeterHegarty, Allan Tyler, Damian McCann, LihMai Laoi, Sarah Davidson, Polly Carmichael, JeremyMonsen, and Neil Rees. In order to develop a structure and contents of the document experts outside the profession wereconsulted, as well as consulting Sections and Divisions at different stages. Their comments anddirection were greatly valued. Special thanks around this to: Dominic Davies, Jan Burns; MartinMilton; Alex Iantaffi; Matthew Waite; Jim McManus; Clinton Anderson; Kathleen Ritter; Ron Fox;Jinthana Haritaworn; Bobbie Petford; James Gray; Damien Riggs; Adam Bourne; Christine Burns;Melanie Steffens; Jan Schippers; Jane Stavert; Doug Ritchie-O’Dell; and Steven Whittle. Thanks arealso given to all the Sections and Divisions that helped with their encouragement and with theconsultation process.For their assistance in supporting the process of developing the guidelines I thank the Chairs of therelevant Sections and Faculties including: Lindsey Moon, Peter Martin, Jenny Taylor, PeterKinderman and John Hannah.Finally many thanks to the BPS Ethics Committee, Martin Crawshaw for his work editing in thefinal phases of the document, the Professional Practice Board and the Preparation for Print (P4P)team who work tirelessly behind the scenes and who made it possible to produce the document onthe web and publicise it.Liz Shaw (Chair of the Working Party)2 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsAcknowledgementsPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 3IntroductionPurpose and status of the documentThese guidelines have been developed in recognition of the importance of guiding andsupporting applied psychologists around their work with sexual and gender minorityclients in order to enable their inclusion in clinical practice at a high standard. They alsoaspire to engender better understanding of clients who may have suffered social exclusionand stigmatisation in order to reduce the possibility of this in the clinical arena. The guidelines reflect where psychologists and society in the UK have reached in terms oflegislation and advances in insight into the clinical issues faced by sexual and genderminority clients. This includes: new core training standards for sexual orientation trainingdeveloped by the Department of Health (DOH, 2006) for the NHS making it an essentialpart of diversity training for staff as a part of the knowledge and skills framework; thePublic Health White Paper ‘Choosing Health’ (DOH, 2004) and the Sexual HealthStrategy recommendations (DOH, 2001) identify training and workforce capacity issues asintegral to the sexual health agenda; guidance for GPs, other clinicians and healthprofessionals on the care of gender variant people (DOH, 2008) and guidance on clearsexual boundaries between health care professionals and patients: responsibilities of healthcare professionals in order to safeguard patients (CHRE, 2008). The Government at thetime of writing has also taken steps to ensure greater equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexualand Transgender People in terms of legislation (Government Equalities Office, 2010)Acknowledgement is also given to the ground-breaking American PsychologicalAssociation (APA) Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clientspublished in 1991, which provided the foundation upon which these guidelines are built.The APA document was written following the American Psychiatric Association’s 1973decision to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders and later evidence thatsuggested the implications of the resolution had not been fully implemented in practice.This document extends the APA guidance to include current fringes of commonunderstanding in the area of gender and minority sexuality, which may be challenging topractitioners, in order to provide Psychologists information, knowledge and skills whichare affirmative and growth oriented for both clients and practitioners. The APA hasrecently issued further guidance on: ‘Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to SexualOrientation’ (APA, 2009) and the Australian Psychological Society has issued ‘Guidelinesfor Psychological Practice with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Clients’ (APS, 2010) which cancomplement aspects of the guidance.How to use the documentThe document is set out as a series of guidelines statements that are linked to a moredetailed evidence-based document with references for personal instruction and reflectionby practitioners who wish to use it. They complement the Division of Clinical Psychology’sProfessional Practice Guidelines (BPS, 1995). The statements have overarching themes sothey are not bound to any one model of therapy and represent general affirmative goodpractice. Detailed guidance on how to undertake therapy is referenced. Central to this is acritical constructivist approach that assumes that beliefs around sexuality and genderevolve over time and that practitioners need to reflect on their own beliefs andassumptions on these issues in order to work ethically and effectively in this field. Thedocument is comprehensive but not exhaustive. It also does not state positions on medicalaspects of treatments but highlights issues that may be encountered related to these.The authors are psychologists from different sections of the Society working with clientswho have sexual and gender minority issues, led mainly by the Faculty of Sexual Healthand HIV and The Psychology of Sexualities Section (previously known as the Lesbian andGay Psychology Section). The inclusion of certain topics and the contents, although broadbut not definitive, has been widely consulted upon by experts within the Society andoutside the organisation (including relevant international organisations), and mirrorsknowledge and frontiers of awareness at the time of writing. This document consists offour parts:Part I describes the ethical requirements of the Health Professions Council on the need forappropriate sexual boundaries between health care professionals and their patients,Part II consists of the guideline statements;Part III, an extended text (which covers some of the latest literature and thinking in thefield); andPart IV, References and Appendix. The areas covered include: psychology and sexual andgender minority clients; the socio-political context and attitudes towards sexual and genderminorities; key issues in sexual and gender minority work (sexual and gender identitiesand practices; relationships and families and diversity); children, young people, schoolsand families; and education/training and professional development.ReferencesAPA (2009).

Factsheet: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and TransgenderEquality. 4 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsThe British Psychological Society advises that these guidelines are set within a context ofthe requirements of the Health Professions Council’s Standards of Conduct, Performanceand Ethics (HPC, 2008).These responsibilities are described in more detail in a report prepared for the regulatorsof health care professionals by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence entitled,‘Clear sexual boundaries between health care professionals and patients: Responsibilitiesof health care professionals’ (CHRE, 2008).It contains information about:● The importance of clear sexual boundaries between health care professionals andtheir patients;● The establishment and maintenance of clear sexual boundaries with patients;● The action that health care professionals must take if they are informed about of, or have concerns about, a breach of sexual boundaries.A summary of the advice notes that, health care professionals must not display sexualisedbehaviour towards patients or their carers, because doing so can cause significant andenduring harm. The health care professional/patient relationship depends on confidenceand trust. A health care professional who displays sexualised behaviour towards a patientbreaches that trust, acts unprofessionally, and may, additionally, be committing a criminal act.The report also provides a definition of sexualised behaviour, which is described as, ‘acts,words or behaviour designed or intended to arouse or gratify sexual impulses or desires’.An illustrative list of unacceptable ‘sexualised behaviours’ are listed in Appendix B of thereport. Breaches of sexual boundaries include criminal acts such as rape and assault butcover a specrum of behaviours including requesting details of sexual orientation, history orpreferences that are not necessary or relevant and telling patients about the clinicians ‘ownsexual problems, preferences or fantasies or disclosing other intimate personal details’.Practitioners are required to meet these standards.ReferencesCHRE (2008).

Standards of Conduct, Performance and Ethics. London: Health ProfessionsCouncil.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 5Part I: Ethical Standards and Responsibilities forPractitioner Psychologists6 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients1 Psychology and sexual and gender minority clients1.1 Psychologists are encouraged to remember that sexual and gender minority identitiesand practices are not in themselves indicative of a mental disorder.Since 1973, when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its listof mental disorders, it has been recognised that same-sex attraction is a normal variant ofhuman sexuality. Similarly there are diverse forms of gender identity none of which isspecifically related to psychopathology. Consistently found, however, is that stigmatising,stressful experiences for sexual and gender minority individuals, resulting from prejudice,can lead to increased risk of emotional problems, suicide attempts, and substance abuse. 2 The socio-political context and attitudes towards sexual andgender minorities2.1 Psychologists are encouraged to recognise that attitudes towards sexuality and genderare located in a changing socio-political context, and to reflect on their own understandingof these concepts.Social attitudes and therapeutic approaches to sexual and gender minorities have evolvedover time in the UK to become more accepting and affirmative rather than pathologising.To be able to undertake practice with such clients, psychologists are encouraged to reflecton how the process and history of social stigmatisation may affect both their clients andthemselves. For some individuals, societal negative attitudes may be internalised, such thatthey experience loathing and shame of their sexual or gender minority identities.Psychologists are also encouraged to recognise how their own attitudes, assumptions andknowledge may be relevant to assessment and treatment of these minority clients. 2.2 Psychologists are encouraged to reflect on the limits to their practice when workingwith sexual and gender minority clients and to consider appropriate referral and trainingwhen indicated.A psychologist unfamiliar with, or having insufficient training in, working with sexual andgender minorities can use their continuous professional development to overcome and/orrecognise the limitations they may have in helping their clients and to refer on to moreappropriate practitioners or agencies. Personal opinion may not be founded onpsychological literature and good practice; this can be acknowledged and explored insupervision. 2.3 Psychologists are encouraged to understand the ways in which social stigmatisation (e.g.prejudice, discrimination and violence) pose risks to gender and sexual minority clients.Psychologists are encouraged to integrate an affirmative stance to their models of practicewhen working with sexual and gender minority clients. Central to this transtheoreticalstance is an understanding of the adverse effects of social stigmatisation on clients’ identitiesand the distress caused to individuals who are seen as different. Interventions may need toPart II: Guideline Statementsacknowledge this explicitly. Psychologists are advised also to pay attention to their ownlanguage which could inadvertently be prejudiced, heterosexist or gender-biased. 2.4 Psychologists are encouraged to consider engagement with the wider socio-politicalcontext regarding sexual and gender minorities in order to reduce social stigma.Psychologists may consider working on an institutional level, such as by informing policy,supporting community groups, and in social action. Psychologists can be proactive ineffecting change, which ultimately will lead to improvement of quality of life and thepsychological well being of these minorities. Psychologists should be aware of Lesbian, Gay,Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) support systems within their workplace orlocally, as they may be a valuable source of information. 3 Key issues in sexual and gender minority workSexual and Gender Identities and Practices 3.1 Psychologists are encouraged to be knowledgeable of the diversity of sexual andgender minority identities and practices.There are many sources of information on sexual and gender minorities and psychologistscan strive to be aware of those beyond the standard academic/medical literature as it canstill be pathologising. They are advised to provide the space for clients to explore possible identities rather thanassuming a particular endpoint. They are advised to be aware that ‘bisexual’ and ‘queer’are possible identities for some that have same-sex attraction, as these are often less visibleand more discriminated against. Some sexual identities and practices do not refer to thegender that people are attracted to, for example asexuality, celibacy, and BDSM (bondageand discipline, dominance and submission, and sadomasochism), and people may adoptmore than one identity or practice.Gender identities intersect with sexual identities in that a transgender person may belesbian, heterosexual, bisexual, gay, queer, etc. Psychologists should be aware of thediversity of gender identities under the umbrella of ‘transgender’, not all of which involveany kind of medical intervention.3.2 Psychologists are encouraged to use the preferred language of sexual and genderminority individuals.Clients may use many different terms to refer to their sexual identities and practices andpsychologists are advised to use those that are used by clients themselves. Some people donot use the standard LGBTQ labels but may be comfortable with, say, MSM (men who havesex with men), WSW (women who have sex with women), culturally specific terms, or‘reclaimed’ terms like ‘dyke’ or ‘slut’.A client’s preferred name and pronoun should be used in person and, where possible, indocumentation. These may be gendered (he/she) or gender-neutral (they). Similarlypsychologists are encouraged to use the client’s preferred term for their relationship andto understand how they define it.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 73.3 Psychologists are encouraged to understand the unique and particular circumstancesand challenges facing clients with diverse gender and sexual identities and practices.When working with clients with specific sexual or gender identities, it is helpful forPsychologists to be informed about key issues relevant to that group, for example,assumptions of promiscuity amongst gay men, double discrimination experienced by manybisexuals (from both heterosexual and lesbian and gay communities), or transgenderpeople feeling pressure to pass as a member of their preferred gender. Psychologists areadvised to be careful not to perpetuate such assumptions or pressures.Relationships and Families3.4 Psychologists are encouraged to understand the diversity of forms of relationships andfamilies in gender and sexual minority clients.Like heterosexuals, many LGBTQ people are in long term-monogamous, or seriallymonogamous, relationships, but significant numbers are involved in openly non-monogamous relationships. These may take the form of casual relationships, open coupledrelationships, or polyamorous (multiple partner) relationships. Some formalise theirrelationships with civil partnerships or other forms of ceremony. Although ‘marriage’ isnot legal in the UK between same-sex partners, some regard, and refer to, theirpartnership as a marriage. Psychologists should check with clients what terms they prefer tobe used.Like any client, a sexual and gender minority client may or may not have children, or beplanning to have children in the future. They might be, or consider being, a single parent,or be in a ‘nuclear’ family, or an extended family where more than two adults are involvedsuch as co-parents or step-parents, or people brought in to enable a pregnancy to occur insame-sex relationships, adoptive children, etc. Psychologists are encouraged to be aware ofdifferent ways of having children, such as people having children in opposite-sexrelationships prior to forming same-sex relationships, sperm donation, gay male couplesparenting with a female friend, or adoption.People in these minorities may refer to their networks of friends, partners and/or expartners as family as well as, or instead of, their family of origin.3.5 Psychologists are encouraged to be aware of the potential challenges facing sexual andgender minority clients in their relationships and families.It is helpful to be aware of the diversity of relationships which may be important for sexualand gender minority clients. They could include sexual relationships that are not ongoingor intimate, or intimate but not sexual, as well as friendships (sexual or non-sexual) andfamily relationships.Relationship problems, including domestic violence and abuse, may be an issue for theseminority clients as much as for any other client. However, issues can sometimes be hidden,for example in a same-sex couple if there is an assumption that power imbalances andviolence only occur in opposite-sex couples, or where a transgender client feels unable tocomplain about a partner who has been accepting of their transition. 8 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsWhilst many relationship and family issues will be very similar to those of other kinds ofclient, there may be particular issues where one member has a change in sexual identity orgoes through a gender transition, or where there is a disparity, for example, where onlyone partner is asexual, non-monogamous or BDSM.Diversity3.6 Psychologists are encouraged to be mindful of the intersections between sexual andgender minority and sociocultural/economic status.Sexual and gender minority clients may be adversely affected by the additive, negativeeffects of having other minority status(es). Being from an ethnic minority, and/or being amigrant or refugee or asylum seeker may contribute to the challenges of being from asexual/gender minority. Some ethnic, cultural and religious communities may not beaccepting of an individual’s sexual preferences or gender identity, and mainstream LGBTQspaces may not always be welcoming, leading to alienation. Such instances have thepotential to stigmatise, and minority individuals may be eroticised or shunned.Similarly, the socio-economic status of individuals may limit access to LGBTQ spaces andservices. Psychologists should also consider the impact of age on individuals’ experiences.Issues related to coming out, parenting, and old age are particularly difficult, given theconstraints in negotiating these life stages. 3.7 Psychologists are encouraged to recognise the particular challenges experienced bygender and sexual minorities with physical and/or mental health difficulties.Sexual and gender minority clients who have a physical and/or mental health problem, or those living with limitations (disabilities) may experience multiple forms of oppression.Some sexual and gender minority communities emphasise the importance of physicalappearance, and they (and the spaces they occupy) may be experienced as exclusive. High rates of mental health concerns, particularly depression, anxiety, substance misuse,and eating disorders have been reported in lesbian, gay, and particularly bisexual andtransgender populations. The rates of deliberate self-harm and attempted and completedsuicide are also higher in these populations. The high rates of these problems are relatedto negative attitudes in society, and sometimes from prejudice and discrimination in healthcare and social services.STIs (including HIV) are prevalent in some, but not all, sexual minority communities.Lesbian, trans and bisexual women’s health tend to be sidelined. Practitioners areencouraged to be aware of the sensitivities inherent in discussing conventionally genderedbody parts and differing body morphologies of transgender people. These health concernsand associated problems of access to non-prejudicial, affirmative health care may prove tobe particularly stressful for sexual and gender minority individuals. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 94 Children, young people, schools and families41 Psychologists are encouraged to recognise the diversity of developmental pathways forsexual and gender minority children and adults.Young LGBQ people often describe feeling ‘different’ from a very early age but may beunable to identify and label it immediately. There are many developmental pathways forsexual minorities. For example, people may embrace an LGBQ identity and engage insame-sex sexual behaviour from an early age. Others may not explore the possibility ofsame-sex attraction until their 20s or later, some after having explored opposite-sexrelationships. It is also possible for people to live with two identities; one of which is publicand heterosexual and the other is private and includes same-sex activity. For many, sexualidentity formation creates a phase of confusion with possible isolation and distress followedby exploration to the point of integration and acceptance with healthy functioning and lifesatisfaction. Psychologists should be particularly careful not to assume that bisexuality is‘just a phase’ as, for many, it is a stable and lasting identity. Others may prefer to avoididentity labels entirely and/or see their sexuality as fluid or on a continuum.In common with sexual identity, transgender identity development may occur at differenttimes in life, with some being aware from an early age but for others, later. For transgenderpeople and those with diverse sex development, adolescence, with the body changes thatoccur during this period, may be a key time. Transgender clients may experience a ‘secondadolescence’ around transition, and the labels used for sexual identity may change.4.2 Psychologists are encouraged to recognise the needs and issues of young people fromgender and sexual minorities, and their particular vulnerabilities and risks.The developmental process of ‘coming out’ is not a single event but something that isrepeated throughout life as LGBTQ people encounter new situations and circumstances.The first few experiences of coming out (particularly to family) can be amongst the moststressful life events for LGBTQ people, however, for many it becomes easier as they getmore experienced, and can even become a non-issue. Despite positive trends, LGBTQ youth continues to fear rejection, intolerance and evenabuse when coming out. This can have a serious and lasting impact on their mental health,leaving them vulnerable to substance misuse, unsafe sex and other risky behaviours.Bullying, teasing and physical violence continue to occur in many UK schools and streets.In the end, LGBTQ youth can be vulnerable to depression, deliberate self-harm, suicide,substance misuse, homelessness, dropping out of school and failing to reach theirpotential. Psychologists involved with diagnosis should be aware of this since suchproblems may disappear when the underlying issues associated with being in a minorityhave been addressed. Transgender youth in particular may be vulnerable to beingostracised due to the social stigma attached to transgressing gender norms. However, wemust not forget the number of LGBTQ youth who are strong and resilient, living out theirlives with as much happiness and angst as anyone else.10 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients4.3 Psychologists are encouraged to support the self-determination of their clients in thedevelopment of their identities and practices.Young people can develop a vast array of sexual and gender identities and practices. This issomething that psychologists should acknowledge and support if they want to help youngpeople to reach their potential. However this may sometimes require psychologists to workwith people who are very different from themselves. Sometimes these differences may bedifficult for psychologists to understand or even appreciate. Therefore it is theirresponsibility to inform themselves about these differences so that they can become morecomfortable and familiar with them. However some psychologists may not value thesedifferences for various reasons. If this is the case, then they should refer people to othermore appropriate practitioners/services, rather than simply discharging them.5 Education/training and professional development5.1 Psychologists are encouraged to seek training in sexual and gender minority issues, how to work in an affirmative manner, and be encouraged to reflect on their own beliefsaround these issues. Continuous Professional Development is an opportunity for this.Psychologists are advised to be trained to work affirmatively and self-reflectively with sexualand gender minority clients irrespective of their main therapeutic approaches. Trainingcourses are advised to mainstream issues of gender and sexuality within their regularteaching, in order to avoid mere tokenistic inclusion of gender and sexuality issues.Psychologists can use CPD to develop self-reflection, skills and knowledge about issues ofsexuality and gender, especially if this was not encountered in pre-qualification training. All psychologists can use CPD in this way because there are no areas of psychology wheresuch clients will not be accessing services.5.2 Psychologists are encouraged to avoid attempting to change gender or sexualminorities on the basis that they can be ‘cured’ or because of stigmatising theory, personal,religious, and/or sociocultural beliefs.Attempting to change a client’s gender or sexual identities as the goal of treatmentbecause of the therapist’s religious, personal, or political beliefs contravenes internationalprofessional guidelines and can be damaging to the client. In the opinion of the authorsany Psychologist taking this approach would be adopting unethical and discriminatoryprofessional practice unsupported by the body of professional opinion in the field ofsexuality and gender. Clients may wish to examine aspects of their sexuality and gender identities and explorepossible tensions between these and other aspects of their lives. This exploration has adifferent goal from imposing a cure solely on the basis of their sexual desires, practices,and minority status(es).Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 1112 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients1. The sociopolitical context1.1 The overall contextPsychology, psychiatry, and other helping professions have a long history of pathologisingsexual and gender identities that do not conform to traditional heterosexual standards andfixed and binary views of sexuality. However, over the last 50 years there have beensignificant socio-political shifts towards greater affirmation and acceptance of people withdiverse sexualities that is mirrored in legislation and changes in psychotherapy practice.The concepts associated with what makes activities and experiences sexual can be seen ashistorically, culturally and regionally determined, and are, therefore, parts of a changingdiscourse involving social and moral judgements (Foucault, 1979). Sexuality is a bio-psycho-social construct. This means that in order to understand sexuality,we need to consider the biological and psychological makeup of an individual, and theirsocial background. Societal views on sexual and gender minority issues are constantlychanging. Affirmative therapists should be aware of the socio-political histories of clients,the society they come from and the society in which they live (see Appendix for a timelineof some of the major events in modern British history that have affected sexual and genderminorities). The socio-political context has the power to affect both sexual and gender minorities, andthe people and institutions they have to deal with in daily life. It can affect the individual’sunderstanding, expressions and acceptance of sexual desires; and access to sexual partners,socialising venues, and goods and services (including health services). The availability ofthese goods and services are in turn linked to societal permissiveness, civil liberties, andlegislation. Lack of support from social systems can have adverse effects on the physicaland psychological health of sexual and gender minorities (see Butler, 2004; King et al.,2003). Pathologising or criminalising people solely for being non-heterosexual may forcesexual minorities to go underground. This is problematic at many levels, as the needs ofsuch groups are not identified or met, and it has personal and public health implications.Personal health problems can include both poor psychological and physical health, whichgo undetected due to lack of targeted interventions and/or appropriate affirmativeservices. Public health concerns may similarly ensue, which may not be curtailed within thesexual minorities’ groups, particularly if people are forced to have double lives. Conversely,a social and political climate that affirms minority sexualities provides opportunities toassess needs and provide appropriate services. Affirmative societal positions on sexual minorities serve as a buffer for such individuals todeal with stress, related or unrelated to sexuality. Socio-political environments that areaffirmative also provide agency to individuals, to recognise their rights, assert them, andseek redress when their rights are curtailed or violated. Such an environment can informlegislative and judicial changes that target prejudice and protect individuals; for instance,in provision of goods and services, equal opportunities, etc. This may also promotevisibility of sexual minorities in society – creating role models for others. Overall, anaffirmative environment provides sexual minorities with formal and informal supportsystems and networks that they can safely access. Part III: The LiteratureSexual rights are human rights, and have been enshrined in the Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Rights ofthe Child. These declarations guarantee rights to personal freedom and choice, health,freedom from discrimination, equal access and opportunity, and protection from violence.These also incorporate sexual identities and behaviours. The United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recognises that the persecution some sexualminorities experience may make them eligible for refugee status for their ‘membership ina particular social group’ (UNHCR, 2002). The denial of sexual health and rights are atthe root of many health-related problems (Butler, 2004). HIV has played a major role in shaping policy related to sexual health and sexualorientation at a national and international level. Such policies have been essential inproviding appropriate services and support for sexual minorities. However, somecommentators have also warned that for further development in this area, we must ensurethat sexuality is not limited to an HIV ‘policy ghetto’ (Keogh, Dodds & Henderson, 2004).Despite this, health inequities related to minority status(es) (and metaminority statuses)exist in the UK. Such groups also have a predisposition to poor psychological health,inadequate pathways to health care, and negative experiences from accessing such servicesdue to their sexuality (King et al., 2003). Affirmative psychologists will, therefore, strive to understand the client’s, the society’s, andhis/her own understanding of, and attitudes to, sexual minority sexualities. If there is aclash of ideas regarding sexuality on the basis of the psychologist’s own personal, culturaland/or religious sentiments which hampers the therapist from providing a sexuality-minority affirmative environment for the client, he/she should consider other sources ofsupport for the client, including referring to another psychologist (e.g. Davies & Neal,2000). This approach provides support, and avenues to improve knowledge and skillsregarding sexuality, and enhances confidence in working with sexual minority clients (see sections on affirmative therapy, education and models of therapy for overlaps).Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 131.2 Phobias, stereotypes, prejudices and ‘isms’1.2.1 DefinitionsSocial psychologists define prejudice as unwarranted antipathy towards a social group(Allport, 1954; Fiske, 1998) and prejudice against lesbians and gay men and bisexualwomen and men has been defined as ‘homophobia’ (Weinberg, 1972), ‘heterosexism’(Herek, 1984) and ‘sexual prejudice’ (Herek, 1999). (The last of these terms will be usedhere). Social constructionists insist that ‘prejudice’ is a flexible concept that takes ondifferent meanings in different contexts. Strong versions of this argument insist that socialpsychological research on prejudice is typically counter to minority groups’ interests (e.g. Billig, 1991; Kitzinger, 1987). Weak versions of the argument point out that peopleconstruct the meaning of ‘prejudice’ in local conversational contexts (e.g. Speer & Potter,2000), and that people who espouse views that might be recognised as ‘prejudice’ by othersoften explicitly describe themselves as non-prejudiced (e.g. Gough, 2002). A small numberof researchers have been inspired by queer theory (e.g. Minton, 1997; Sedgwick, 1991[(but c.f., Shidlo, 1994]; Warner, 1993) to think of sexual ideologies as ‘heteronormative’,because these ideologies proscribe heterosexuality as the identity for all (e.g. Hegarty,Pratto & Lemieux, 2004; Kitzinger, 2004). ‘Prejudice’ can vary widely between majoritygroup definitions and minority group experiences; strategies that heterosexual peopleadopt to appear ‘non-prejudiced’ in interactions with Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual (LGB)people do not always work (Conley, Calhoun, Evett & Devine, 2001). Currently, less than 10 per cent of the heterosexual British public think that they are prejudiced againstlesbians and gay men (MORI, 2003). 1.2.2 HistoryResearch on sexual prejudice was scant prior to the depathologising of homosexuality inthe early 1970s (although see Smith, 1971). The term ‘homophobia’ became popularbeyond sexual minority communities through the work of George Weinberg (1972). 14 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsCase Study: Jo is a 20-year-old white woman who comes from a rural area. She and herfamily (who she lives with) are practising Catholics. Jo is torn between her love for hergirlfriend and her religious beliefs, which she believes are incongruent. The first personshe disclosed this to was the parish priest, who advised her to pray to overcome thisproblem and referred her to the local counsellor. The counsellor, also from the sameparish, was understanding and listened to her but Jo wondered whether she reallyunderstood her problem. The focus of therapy seemed to explore why Jo had thesefeelings, but Jo wanted to know how to deal with them, and how others dealt with similarfeelings. The counsellor admitted that she did not know anyone who had same-sex desires.Comment: Jo’s case illustrates the difficulties clients can face when attempting toassimilate two seemingly discrepant aspects of ones life. Her social environment couldbe alienating if there are no visible support systems or local role-models. Despite thecounsellor’s best intentions, she would not be able to help Jo in her quest to know howto deal with her feelings if she herself has no contact with, or knowledge of, supportsystems for sexual minority clients. She would also need to examine her own feelingsand attitudes towards same-sex desire if she is to work affirmatively with Jo.Like other theorists of this period, Weinberg understood ‘homophobia’ as related tosexual repression, such that both heterosexuals’ unwillingness to accept openly lesbian andgay people, and their unwillingness to accept their own same-sex desires were included inthe definition of ‘homophobia’ (Hegarty & Massey, 2006). Models of ‘heterosexism’ thatdeveloped in the 1980s re-conceptualised sexual prejudice as a prejudice against a distinctminority group defined by sexual object choice, often drawing analogies to ethnic andreligious prejudices (e.g. Herek, 1984). For different reasons, both questionnaireresearchers (Herek, 1984), and critics of questionnaire research (Kitzinger, 1987) arguedfor the term ‘heterosexism’ over ‘homophobia.’ Both rejected the association of sexualprejudice with pathological fear and mental illness (understood to reside in the suffix –phobia), and both called for more societal level analyses of prejudice against sexualminorities. Lesbians and gay men were understood to be the targets of ‘heterosexism’ andpsychologists’ theorising around prejudice against bisexuals developed only later (e.g.Spalding & Peplau, 1997). In the 1980s, researchers also examined the obvious stigmaattached to HIV/AIDS that was largely associated with gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals inpopular media (e.g. Herek & Glunt, 1988). While the literature on sexual prejudice hasgrown with each decade since the 1970s, this literature remains, like most of the literatureon LGB psychology, focused on men more than on women, and on homosexuals morethan bisexuals (see Lee & Crawford, 2007). Research on prejudice against transpeople israre and recent, but that research suggests that ‘transphobia’ is rampant (Hill &Willoughby, 2005; Tee & Hegarty, 2006).1.2.3 Heterosexist attitudesQuestionnaire research has painted a consistent picture of people with higher levels ofsexual prejudice as male, uneducated, religious, older, sexually conservative people whodon’t know any LGB people personally, and who think that sexual orientation is freelychosen rather than determined by biology (Herek, 1994, 1984; Herek & Glunt, 1996; Kite & Whitley, 1998; Whitley, 1990). Heterosexism is learned early, particularly amongboys who use gay slurs to insult each other in middle childhood prior to the emergence ofadolescent sexualities (Horn, 2006, Preston & Stanley, 1987). Although much attitudinalresearch assumes that sexual minorities are distinct bounded groups, and such researchoften draws analogies between sexual prejudice and racism, several findings trouble theseanalogies. First, unlike racism, sexual prejudice appears to be a form of within-groupprejudice, motivated by concern with moral authority and the policing of deviance, ratherthan an inter-group prejudice like racism (Whitley, 1999). Second, African-Americansexual minority individuals report that racism is a more pervasive prejudice than sexualprejudice (Battle et al., 2002). Third, sexual orientation is also understood to beconcealable, such that heterosexual people might be misperceived as lesbian or gay whileWhite people rarely express concern about being mistaken for members of ethnicminorities. In straight men in particular the prospect of being misrecognised as gayengenders particular discomfort (Bosson, Prewitt-Freilino & Taylor, 2005). 1.2.4 Modern prejudiceIn the UK, under New Labour, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) peoplehave benefited from a wide platform of new civil rights in family, employment,immigration, and educational contexts, leading some to describe Britain as ‘the world wehave won’ (Weeks, 2007). Patterns of sexual prejudice have also changed in WesternPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 15democracies in the last 25 years. Support for the civil rights and human rights of sexualminority individuals has increased. Heterosexual people report that they personally knowmore LGB people than they did in the 1980s. In contrast, emotional responses to lesbiansand gay men have shown less progress and attitudes toward the behavioural expression ofhomosexuality remain negative (Herek, 2006; Yang, 1999). The new norm of equality hasled some researchers to conceptualise sexual prejudice as a ‘modern’ prejudice (c.f.McConahay & Hough, 1976) that does not target sexual identity per se but particular formsof expression in behaviour (e.g. Hegarty, 2006; Morrison & Morrison, 2002). Support forsexual orientation equality in the abstract – while now common – often evaporates in thecontexts where it is most relevant. Many heterosexual people who support lesbian and gaycivil rights often reject concrete measures to bring those rights about (Ellis, Kitzinger &Wilkinson, 2002). Heterosexuals will continue to treat gay people negatively if given achance to do so that is about something other than identity (Moreno & Bodenhausen,2001; Morrison & Morrison, 2002), even in situations where they are concerned withfairness (Hegarty et al., 2004). In an era of equality, heterosexual people may harbourmore prejudice than they are willing to admit (Ratcliff, Lassiter, Markman & Snyder, 2006),and prejudice is subtly communicated through non-verbal channels (Hebl et al., 2002).1.2.5 Maintaining and reducing sexual prejudice This section discusses three processes related to prejudice reduction and maintenance.First, intergroup contact, under certain conditions, has long been argued to reduce manyforms of prejudice (Allport, 1954). Indeed, intergroup contact breaks down sexualprejudice more than most other form of prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). However,there can be psychological costs associated with such contact. Interactions between gay andstraight people are scripted (Hegarty et al., 2004) and play out (Miller & Malloy, 2003) withasymmetric rights and responsibilities for the management of discomfort. Sexual minoritypeople select whom they come out to quite strategically (Conley et al., 2002). Straightpeople can also experience ‘courtesy stigma’ or guilt by association as a result of knownfriendships with gay people (Snyder & Omoto, 2002; Sigelman et al., 1991; see alsoGoffman, 1963) A second strategy that has been much publicised is the changing of attitudes by changingbeliefs in the origins of human sexual orientation. Particularly in the US, heterosexualpeople who consider sexual orientation to be biologically determined tend to evince moretolerant attitudes (e.g. Haslam & Levy, 2006; Hegarty & Pratto, 2001a; Whitley, 1990).Members of sexual minorities sometimes report describing their sexual orientations asinborn to garner better reactions from others (Whisman, 1996). Several authors haveinterpreted these findings as meaning that biological beliefs cause differences in attitudes(e.g. Altemeyer, 2001; Jayaratne et al., 2006; Whitley, 1990). However, studies designed totest this specific claim have suggested that biological beliefs might just as easily rationalisepre-existing attitudes (Hegarty, 2002; Hegarty & Golden, 2008), have evidenced botheffects of attitudes on beliefs and the reverse (Haslam & Levy, 2006), or have demonstratedthe co-occurance of both ‘nature’ and ‘nurture’ theories in the same heterosexualindividuals (Sheldon et al., 2007). The correlation is not controversial; the cause of thecorrelation remains so. 16 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsA third factor which merits attention as something that might maintain sexual prejudice isdisparagement humour which targets discriminated groups and which allows the expressionof blatant prejudice to appear normal (Ford & Ferguson, 2004). British heterosexualsreport that they get their information about sexual minorities largely from television(MORI, 2003). This medium contains negative and unrealistic content about LGB people,including derogatory humour focused particularly on gay men’s sexuality and expressionsof gender (Cowan & Valentine, 2006). This topic merits further research, specifically in aBritish context. 1.2.6 StereotypesSocial psychologists understand stereotypes to be beliefs about the attributes of socialgroups (Fiske, 1998). These beliefs are distinct from negative attitudes, which are moreclearly evaluative. But stereotypes are thought to play an important role in the maintenanceof inequality, by justifying the status quo. Common stereotypes tend to centre on beliefsabout gender-inversion for lesbians and gay men (Deaux & Lewis, 1984; Kite & Deaux,1987), unfaithfulness for bisexual women and men (Spalding & Peplau, 1997), promiscuityfor gay men (Simon, 1998), and unattractiveness for lesbian women (Dew, 1985).People think that they can infer more about a person when they know they are lesbian orgay, than when they know that they are straight (Haslam, Rotschild & Ernst, 2000).Stereotypes do not always colour a perceiver’s judgments of individuals, but are more likelyto do so when the perceiver’s self-esteem is threatened (Fein & Spencer, 1996), and whenthe perceiver can construct reasonable grounds to justify the stereotype (Kunda & Oleson,1995). Several findings suggest that stereotypes lead to strategies of information processingthat maintain the illusion that they are useful guides about others. For example,heterosexual people call to mind knowledge about lesbian stereotypes only when theylearn that a woman has come out (Snyder & Uranowitz, 1978), selectively believe researchfindings about lesbians and gay men to be valid when they are stereotype consistent(Hegarty & Pratto, 2001b, 2004), and think that lesbian and gay people are moreprototypical when they conform to gender-related stereotypes (Fingerhut & Peplau, 2006). 1.2.7 Hate crimesThe most extreme form that sexual prejudice can take is the perpetration of hate crimes.Community surveys report that violent crimes are common experiences among lesbian,gay, bisexual and transgender (LGB and T) populations (Berrill, 1992; Lombardi et al.,2001; Oxfordfordshire HALT, 2005) with physical abuse and violent crimes beingexperienced by significant minorities, and verbal abuse being experienced by a majority ofthose surveyed. Studies that have used random-digit-dialing to access more representativesamples in the US have found that hate crimes are disproportionately targeted at gay menrather than lesbian women, or bisexual women and men (Herek, 2009). Perpetrators ofhate crimes are typically young males acting in concert, often men who understand theirattitudes to be ‘liberal’ (Franklin, 1998). Consistent with the view that homophobia ismotivated by conformity to authoritarian norms, this has led some researchers toconceptualise anti-gay prejudice as a ritual enactment of masculinity (Franklin, 2004). Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 171.2.8 Consequences of sexual prejudiceOne of the key assumptions of the ‘stigma model’ of LGB psychology is the idea thatmental and physical ill-health issues that are particular to sexual minorities follow fromexperiences of prejudice rather than from any inherent pathology. Research suggests thatLGB people face vexing double-binds about how to enact their identities, and thatdifferent strategies lead to different kinds of negative outcomes. For example, those whoare closeted are more likely to become physically ill (Cole, Kemeny & Taylor, 1997; Cole etal., 1996), while those who are ‘out’ are more likely to face stigmatisation and hate crimes(Herek, Gillis & Cogan, 1999; Waldo, 1999). Effects of perceived and enactedstigmatisation on mental health have been found in several large national studies (e.g. Bos et al., 2008; Sandfort et al., 2001; Warner, 2004; see Meyer, 2003; Ryan & Rivers,2003 for reviews). These effects may work through separating LGB people from socialcontacts – both sexual minority and heterosexual – that sustain mental health (Fingerhut,Peplau & Ghavami, 2005), as well as through the more controversial construct of‘internalised homophobia’ (c.f., Shidlo, 1994). 1.3 Psychological and psychiatric perspectivesFor the most part, the mental health professions have had some difficulties inunderstanding, accepting and responding to the vast range of sexual identities andexpressions. After first being considered as a moral sin and later as a punishable crime forcenturies, same-sex attraction and sexual activity became medicalised as a mental illness inthe late nineteenth century (Bayer, 1981; Drescher, 2002; King & Bartlett, 1999; Taylor,2002). Starting with Krafft-Ebing’s Psychopathia Sexualis (1886), homosexuality was firstcategorised as a pathological degeneracy along with criminality and other ‘perversions’such as paedophilia. Indeed, this movement towards medicalising many forms of deviancyand difference affected many groups of society, often in the most negative and persecutoryways (Foucault, 1979). However, same-sex attraction later became conceptualised as a formof developmental arrest by Freud (1905) who proposed that male homosexuality was theresult of an unresolved Oedipal Complex. Freud believed that a child’s psychosexual development started with an innate andimmature ‘bisexual’ state that developed naturally into a mature and healthy heterosexualorientation. Therefore, homosexuality was a possibility for anyone since it was an arrested,immature form of sexuality. As a result, Freud believed it to be problematic and difficultbut not evil or degenerate. In fact, his famous letter to an American mother has beensuggested as a reflection of his relatively benign acceptance of homosexuality, as acondition that could be tolerated and adjusted to. In the end, Freud’s ideas ofhomosexuality being a form of psychological immaturity proved unacceptable and/ormisguided by subsequent psychoanalysts. Psychoanalysts such as Rado (1940) and Beiber,Dain and Dince (1962) contended that homosexuality was an irrational phobic reaction toheterosexuality whereas others such as Socarides (1965) claimed it was an unconsciousreaction to the trauma and pain of maternal separation. Regardless of the specifics, thesepsychoanalytic views afforded the possibility and promise of reparation and growth towardsa heterosexual orientation as the one and only healthy norm of adult sexuality. Thesetheories had significant impact during the mid-20th century and provided the rationale forincluding homosexuality in the second edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual(American Psychiatric Association, 1968). As a result, scores of individuals received18 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientstreatment, sometimes with coercion, to cure their homosexuality with questionable results(Drescher, 2002; Smith, Bartlett & King, 2004).This approach to homosexuality dominated the mental health professions for decades yetthe evidence for the effectiveness of such ‘conversion therapies’ has never been able towithstand the scrutiny of science. This in conjunction with gay activism and the growingbody of scientific evidence that failed to link homosexuality to mental illness or emotionalinstability compelled the American Psychiatric Association to remove it from their officiallist of mental disorders in 1973 (Bayer, 1981; Drescher, 2002; Garnets, 2007). This boldmove signalled a change to view same-sex attraction and sexual activity as a normal variantof human sexuality. The significance of this turnaround and de-classification ofhomosexuality as a mental disorder has been immense. For example, it paved the way for anew legitimate and truly diverse field of theory and research: the experience of beingsomething other than heterosexual or straight (Garnets, 2007; Kitzinger & Coyle, 2002). It also provided the opportunity for mental health professionals to start developingsensitive, appropriate and affirmative psychotherapy guidelines (American PsychologicalAssociation, 1991; Davies & Neal, 1996; Milton, Coyle & Legg, 2002). However, reparative or conversion therapies based on psychoanalytic or behaviouralprinciples have become embedded within fundamentalist religious doctrine and continueto operate today despite being condemned by many professional organisations such as theAmerican Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, and AustralianPsychological Society. Examples of biased, inappropriate or ineffective psychologicalpractice continue to be observed (Bartlett, King & Phillips, 2001; Bartlett, Smith & King,2009; Garnets et al., 1991; Milton, 1998; Milton, Coyle & Legg, 2005). While this may bedisheartening and concerning for many, it cannot be that surprising given thatcontemporary society continues to promote heterosexuality as the standard of normalityand affords it with prestige and privilege (Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, 2000;Matthews, 2007; Taylor, 2002, see Section 4 for more on conversion therapies).2. Key issued in sexual and gender minorities work2.1 Sexual identities/Ways of beingSurveys and medical forms often ask for people’s sexual ‘orientation’ but, like the word‘homosexual’, this term is rarely used by people in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgenderand Queer (LGBTQ) communities themselves (Perez, DeBord & Bieschke, 2000). Theshift from ‘orientation’ to ‘identity’ is a move from a technical/medical language to onewhich reflects general Western understanding about the individual in society and links tothe idea of identity projects where people are working on their self-identities throughouttheir lives (Giddens, 1992). It is also important to remember that language of identities(including the very notion of identity itself) is historically and socially contingent (Weeks,2003; Faderman, 1984; Sophie, 1986). It may be advisable instead to focus on the way that a client describes him or herself and avoid the imposition of medical/technical language.For many people the concept of identity is important in terms of how they understandthemselves and how they communicate to others. There may be a sense of security andsafety in identifying with a fixed identity (Langdridge, 2007). There can be less work to doin communicating identity to others and less need for justification and explanation inidentifying with an established identity. This is perhaps less so for bisexual and transPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 19identities which remain less recognised in society than gay and lesbian identities (Barker &Langdridge, 2008). An important part of the therapeutic process may, therefore, be enabling clients to feel secure in their self-descriptions.In the past, and still today, people who work with sexual minorities recognise that there arepeople who do not subscribe to an identity even if their practices would suggest that theydo. This is about self-identity rather than giving someone a label. Terms such as ‘men whohave sex with men’ have been used in the sexual health arena as a way of including menwho do not identify as gay or bisexual even though their practices may be such that othersmay apply this label. Labels must be a self-ascription and some may not want to embracelabels for a variety of reasons including a deliberate choice not to live with fixed labels (see below) or due to cultural factors such as race and class, or because they may beengaging in practices in secret.There are increasing numbers of people challenging the notion of fixed identities. Peoplemay see sexualities as what they ‘do’ rather than what they ‘are’, or feel differently aboutdifferent identities (for example seeing Bondage and Discipline, Dominance andSubmission, and Sadomasochism [BDSM] as their identity but the gender of partner theyare with as something they practice, see below). ‘Queer’ for a growing minority is a way ofquestioning fixed and stable sexual identities (Jagose, 1996; Moon, 2008). Some clientsmay experience shifting identities through their lifetime and/or may be reluctant toembrace identity labels at all.For most people, identities are plural. Whilst some might be more important aspects thanothers, the intersection of multiple identities (such as sexual, gendered, classed and racialidentities) may well be crucial in terms of how a person identifies and understandsthemselves within a particular social context (Anthias & Yuval-Davis, 1983). Furthermore,other identifications, such as class or race, may be considerably more significant than aperson’s sexual identity and/or may be complexly related to it. It is important to work withclients such that they can be encouraged to elaborate their sexual identity in relation toother possible identities (see section on socio-cultural diversity).In this section we are dealing with the most common sexual identities in current UKsociety. However, some will see other sexual or relationship practices as key aspects of theiridentity (e.g. SM, non-monogamy, transvestism, drag) and increasingly people are definingasexuality as an alternative identity (www.asexuality.org).2.1.1 GayThere may well be an assumption that gay men coming for therapy will be presentingbecause they have issues with their sexuality, for instance developmental or coming-outissues. Whilst this may be the case for some gay men, it is likely that a significant numberwill be presenting to deal with everyday concerns with living and generic mental healthissues unrelated to their sexual identity (Davies & Neal, 1996). However, even in thesecontexts a client’s sexual identity is likely to influence their experience and potential,although this will not necessarily raise specific issues that the psychologist needs to addresswith the client.There are a number of significant issues that psychologists should be aware of whenworking with gay men. Many of these revolve around gay men’s understanding of what itmeans to be a man, especially notions of masculinity and femininity. Wider social20 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsunderstanding of gay men still tends to position them as feminine and passive (Gough,2002). This can be experienced as problematic, particularly for those who do notexperience their identity in this way. Living up to an ideal of what it means ‘to be a man’can be a key issue for many gay men (Connell, 1987). There is not just one masculinity butmultiple masculinities and ways of being a man, and these are changing and dynamicprocesses rather than being fixed within people (Connell, 1995).Gay men may take part in a variety of sexual practices and many of these practices may beconsidered abnormal outside the gay community but are actually considered normativepractices within it. Examples would include cruising/cottaging and non-monogamousrelationships, all of which are commonplace activities for gay men (see below, Heaphy,Donovan & Weeks, 2004).Gay men, like heterosexual men, will adopt a variety of different political and life positions.Not all want to be like heterosexuals and equally not all necessarily want to be differentfrom them (Coyle & Kitzinger, 2002). In recent years gay rights activists have fought forequality in terms of relationship recognition (civil partnerships), adoption rights and so on(Langdridge & Barker, 2006). It is important to recognise, however, that whilst numbers ofgay men will embrace these developments wholeheartedly, others may well express a desireto remain outside such heteronormative institutions (see above).2.1.2 LesbianTraditionally, both historically and in contemporary UK, lesbian identities are far lessvisible than gay male identities (Markowe, 2002). Partly this is due to being in a situation ofdouble oppression in society (being a woman and being non-heterosexual) (Kitzinger,1987). This is likely to have an impact on the experience of living as a lesbian and to showitself in the ways in which lesbians may present in the consulting room. It may well affectthe ease with which some women are able to own a lesbian identity and as a consequencesome may talk more of friendships between women, whilst others may project their identitystrongly due to the general silencing of lesbian sexuality.Part of the invisibility of lesbian experience is the common assumption that sex is notimportant, or even a priority, for lesbians and that they are more focused on emotionalaspects of relationships (Markowe, 2002). Whilst of course this may be the case for some,this can be a pernicious stereotype and many lesbians engage fully in a variety of sexualpractices. It is often assumed that lesbian sexual practices are entirely focused on oraland/or manual sex. However, there are many other common practices including the use ofPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 21Case Study: A gay male client was being referred to another psychologist and was askedif he particularly wanted to see a gay psychologist. He responded by saying: ‘No, justsomeone who isn’t freaked out by me having sex in graveyards.’Comment: The important issue here was to recognise that this gay man, like manyothers, was referring to cruising activity that often takes place in secluded areas such asgraveyards and constituted a normal and unproblematic aspect of his sex life. Hisexpressed concern represented his fear at being judged by psychologists projectingtheir own standards of normal sexual contact onto him.strap-on dildos and vibrators, fisting, anal sex and BDSM practices. (see sections on sexualpractices and relationships). Similarly not all lesbians are in monogamous relationships andsome may be in multiple relationships or enjoy casual sexual encounters (Newman, 2004).Another common stereotype of lesbian sexual identities is that either all lesbians aremasculine in outlook and appearance, or that lesbian relationships will pair alongbutch/femme lines embracing gender stereotypes of hard, active masculinity and soft,passive femininity. Whilst some lesbians embrace and/or play with such heteronormativedynamics, others actively reject gender stereotypes.Menopause and such specifically women’s health issues (e.g. breast cancer, hysterectomyand infertility) may differentially impact lesbians. For example, infertility may combinewith the difficulties already facing lesbians who want to have children. Many lesbians’identities are bound up in their gender, sexual practices, and/or reproductive capacitybecause their identities were formed in an inherently political way. For example, somewomen may have particular issues around their femininity which are significantlychallenged through the menopause and/or medical interventions such as hysterectomyand mastectomy which alter the body (Wilkinson, 2002).2.1.3 BisexualBisexuality can often be completely overlooked as a potential sexual identity becauseWestern culture is still prone to see gender and sexuality as ‘dichotomous’ (you are eithera man or a woman, you are either attracted to a man or a woman, see also section ongender minorities below) (Barker, 2007). Therefore, many people feel pushed towards agay/lesbian or straight identity rather than feeling that bisexuality is a legitimate sexualidentity in itself. Bisexuality is less established as a potential identity in wider society thanlesbian and gay identities and often perceived as a transitory stage in a person’s sexualdevelopment (Barker & Langdridge, 2008). It is, of course, important to recognise thatsome gay men and lesbians do identify as bisexual as part of their coming out process.However, many people may maintain a bisexual identity, and some may identify as gay orlesbian on their way to embracing a bisexual identity.There can be a tendency to refer to all sexual minority clients as ‘lesbian or gay’ and,therefore, subsume bisexuals, once again, within a lesbian or gay identity (Fox, 2006). For instance, if a client expresses same-sex preferences, it may be assumed that this meansthat they have a lesbian or gay identity without bisexuality being offered as a possibilityalongside lesbian and gay identities.Bisexuals often suffer ‘double discrimination’, being perceived as outsiders by both straightand gay/lesbian communities, sometimes to the extent of being banned from gay clubs andnot accepted on Pride marches (Ochs, 1996). This may be particularly pertinent to bisexualpeople with different sex partners who may feel ostracised by lesbian/gay communitiesbecause they are seen as possessing a degree of privilege not available to them and as beingable to ‘pass’ in straight society. Additionally there can be the common media representationof bisexual people as being greedy, sexual predators and amoral, hedonistic spreaders ofdisease and disrupters of families (Barker et al., 2008). It is possible that bi people will be onthe receiving end of both homophobia and biphobia, and research suggests that this may bewhy bisexual people suffer from higher rates of mental health problems than lesbians andgay men; who in turn have higher rates than the general population (e.g. Jorm et al., 2002).22 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsGender issues may also be involved in identifying as bisexual. People understand theirbisexuality in different ways. Some see it as being attracted to both men and women at thesame time, some recognise that attraction on the basis of gender may shift and change overthe life course whilst not diminishing the sense of being bisexual. Others regard bisexualityas being attracted to people regardless of gender (Petford, 2003). Gender identity andsexual identity can cut across each other for bisexual people in various ways. For example,bisexual women may be very aware of the ways in which they are eroticised in the mediawhilst bisexual men may feel the need to prove their bisexuality because of the popularnotion that bisexual men do not exist (Barker, et al., 2008).It may well be difficult for bisexual people to access a community, particularly those wholive outside large urban areas. Whilst there are established gay, and to some extent lesbian,communities across the country, bisexuality has no commercial scene and thereforecommunities are more grass-roots in nature. There are, however, several useful internetresources, magazines such as Bisexual Community News, and events such as local BiFests andthe annual UK BiCon.2.1.4 QueerLGBT people and communities are not unitary phenomena, rather there are manyoverlapping LGBT communities and identities. The 1990s witnessed the rise of people andcommunities who termed themselves ‘queer’ rather than LGBT. Queer as a concept arosewithin grass root politics with growing numbers of people dissatisfied with the notion offixed identities (Jagose, 1996). This was particularly prevalent amongst HIV/AIDS activistsand black feminist activists dissatisfied with the normativity of particularly lesbian and gayidentities and communities. Some embraced a queer label to encompass these differencesand (crucially) to emphasise the dissident nature of their sexualities. Queer may functionfor many as representing the bitchy, fractious, difficult, uncompromising, unapologeticaspects of the movement – the dissident or transgressive gay citizen. This is in contrast tolesbian and gay which is seen to represent the good gay citizen (Bell & Binnie, 2000).The label ‘queer’ also relates to the academic theoretical approach of queer theory(Seidman, 1996). This offers a radically different understanding of sex, gender andsexuality, refusing to accept simple dichotomies (like that between men and women orlesbian/gay and heterosexual) and instead poses a challenge to the dominant heterosexualfoundations of sexuality. It is a conceptualisation of sexuality which sees sexual powerembodied in different levels of social life (enforced through boundaries and binarydivides). Queer theory involves the problematisation of sexual and gender categories (andidentities more generally), a rejection of civil-rights strategies in favour of carnival,transgression and parody, and a willingness to interrogate areas not usually seen as theterrain of sexuality and engage in queer readings of such texts. At its strongest it entailstransgression of all conventional categorisations and the breaking of boundaries. Morecommonly (though much more narrowly) it entails the reclamation of the word queerfrom the oppressors by the (previously) oppressed (Seidman, 1996).People who engage with queer identifications, queer activism and/or queer theory mayrefuse to take up a fixed position with regard to sexuality, gender, race and so on. It is astrategy that may be politically motivated and/or one which simply represents a person’sunderstanding of how they wish to live (Moon, 2008). Therefore, they may not want toPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 23work towards establishing fixed identities or even fixed relationships as these may not bedesirable (Langdridge, 2008). For some, such a temporary and contingent identificationmay result in difficulties in terms of their own understanding of self, how theycommunicate with the outside world, and in terms of finding appropriate communitieswhere they feel at home. Others may find alliances with bi and trans communities and withspecifically queer groups. Some may identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay or heterosexual andas queer, recognising both the problems and potentials of identity labels.2.2 Gender MinoritiesGender minorities are often described as trans (Lev, 2004), people who are in some waytransgendered or who ‘transgress’ gender boundaries. Trans is generally perceived aspertaining to gender identity rather than sexual identity, but common experience (ofbeing similarly marginalised and discriminated against) has meant that trans agendas havebecome aligned with those of LGB communities in recent years. This has not been withoutsome resistance on both sides (Serano, 2007; Wilchins, 1997). In the past trans womenhave been excluded from women-only spaces and some still may find it difficult to beaccepted if it is known that they have chosen not to have genital reassignment surgery (Richards & Barker, 2012; Lev, 2004). Although the exact presentation of different transpeople is partially culturally determined, trans people have been found in all cultures andall times (Herdt, 1996).2.2.1 General IssuesIt is important for psychologists to be aware that, as with LGB people, many trans peoplecoming to therapy will want to discuss issues unrelated to their trans identities. It can oftenbe difficult for trans people to access non specialist services as it is assumed that theirneeds are a ‘specialist area’ just because they are trans, even though their issues may relateto bereavement, family, relationships, work, or children, areas within the scope ofcompetent psychologists who are not specialists in working with gender minorities. An accepting attitude is important and an avoidance of the assumption that being trans isthe problem. Trans men is a term often used to describe men who are living in a male gender role whowere natally assigned as women and trans women to describe women living the femalegender role who were natally assigned as men. People may describe themselves as transmen and trans women though still in their natally assigned gender role as essentially theyare still the same person in whatever gender role they adopt and their gender identity mayhave always been of a different gender to their socially assigned natal gender. Transgender(now also, increasingly, just ‘trans’) is a broad term encompassing a variety of genderedidentities including transsexual, genderqueer, third sex, androgynous, drag king/queen,transvestite (see practices below) and/or people who are undergoing, or have undergone,hormone treatment and/or surgery in order that their body form fits with their genderedidentity. Psychologically androgynous trans people can find they do not comfortably fit intodichotomous gender labels and experience themselves as neither male nor female nor both(Carrol, Gilroy & Ryan, 2002; Eyler, 2007). They may find it difficult to describe orcommunicate their experience within common discourses that assume only two genders.They may start seeking gender reassignment because, having found it difficult to live in one24 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsgender role, they consider that maybe they ‘should’ be in the other. This is often reinforcedby reactions from others who find it uncomfortable not to be able to label the person asmale or female. As with common therapeutic encounters it is therapeutically beneficial tolisten to the person’s actual experience (Cooper, 2008). In the face of continued socialemphasis on two genders some people do move down the path of gender reassignmentfinding it difficult to live in a non-specified social gender. Others find a more androgynouspath or a more comfortable compromise once able to explore their experience in atherapeutic space without being judged. When in therapeutic conversation with transpeople some researchers have suggested it is useful in creating rapport for psychologists tobe open to using the gender labels, names and pronouns used by the client themselves(Goethals & Schwiebert, 2005).Gender Dysphoria is a commonly used professional term used to describe experienceddissonance between gender identity and phenotype (the external characteristics of thebody) (Barrett, 2007). Clients may present stating they have ‘gender dysphoria’. It isimportant to explore what exactly that means for them and the implications it has for theirlives. For some gender dysphoria may mean to them an extreme state of confusion, othersmay have a clear gender identity which is simply incongruent with the body that is sociallyperceived as fitting that gender identity. The former may want psychological input andcounselling specifically around experienced gender dysphoria, the latter counsellingaround their options and the implications of those options for family, relationships,children, work, friends, etc. Gender dysphoria is usually more appropriate to describestages of life when distress and/or confusion is experienced in relation to gender identityand social gender role and phenotype. For example a trans woman with a strong femalegender identity may have reassigned gender role, be taking feminising hormonetreatment, have no gender related stress or dissonance, but have not chosen to havegender reassignment surgery. To describe such an individual as ‘gender dysphoric’ wouldbe unnecessarily pathologising.Gender dysphoria can fluctuate over years, not infrequently increasing or decreasing inmid life and it is not unusual for people to present for therapeutic discussion and supportlater in life (Blanchard, 1990; Barrett, 2007; Richards & Barker, 2012). Social stigma andfamily issues can also delay people expressing their gender identity. Counselling andpsychotherapy to ‘cure’ transsexuality has generally been unsuccessful and runs counter tocurrent professional knowledge and practice in the field. Indeed some research suggeststhat analytic psychotherapy prior to physical interventions to aid trans people may beunnecessary (Meyer et al., 2001; Seikowski, 2007) or even harmful (Lawrence, 2003;Loewenberg & Krege, 2007). If clients are referred by external agencies because they havepresented with gender related concerns it is useful to identify – with the client – whetherthey are seeking counselling or psychotherapy or whether referral to a Gender IdentityClinic (GIC) is being requested. The weight of current scientific evidence regardingtranssexualism suggests a biologically-based, psychosocial multifactoral aetiology (Cohen-Kettenis & Pfafflin, 2003). The question ‘Why am I the way I am?’ is a frequent and maybeimportant question. Focusing excessively on ‘causal factors’, however, can be pathologising,damaging to self-esteem and position the person not only other to the norm, but in someway defective relative to the norm. Counselling and psychotherapy can be useful in thisarea. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 25Some clients may have mild gender dysphoria and may eventually experience it as part ofwho they are, or develop a positive trans identity. Unfortunately some well-meaning people,trans and non-trans, can be quick to inform people presenting with gender related distressthat they ‘must be transsexual’ and should reassign gender and have gender reassignmentmedical interventions such as hormone therapy and surgery. This does not take intoaccount the broad range of people who experience gender confusion, for many of whomthis is not the appropriate path, and who can be left with extreme regrets and irreversiblephysical changes. Sometimes people experience mild or transitory gender dysphoria. It should not always be assumed that this indicates the person is definitely trans. In somecases the reported desire to change sex may be symptomatic of a psychiatric condition forexample psychosis, schizophrenia or a transient obsession such as may occur withAsperger’s syndrome (Barrett, 2007). Trans clients who have these diagnoses do gothrough gender reassignment, but careful assessment and discussion with the person andsignificant others will have established with them that the gender dysphoria is notsymptomatic of these things. The internet has enabled trans people to communicate moreeffectively and to support each other, this is a useful resource for a group of people whohave historically been marginalised; a list of resources can be found at the end of thischapter. The downside is that the lack of face-to-face information means that they do notalways have the full picture on who they are communicating with and may ‘coach’ peopleon what to say to obtain hormone treatment and genital surgery without any awareness ofthe real potential consequences for the individual involved (cf Dewey, 2008). 2.2.2 Coping strategiesDue to the chronic stress associated with living with hidden gender dysphoria, substanceabuse may be a coping strategy for trans people prior to coming out or receivingtreatment. There are not infrequently early histories of alcohol and drug abuse (Israel &Tarver, 1997). Alcohol and drugs may have been used to suppress the feelings of genderdysphoria and occasionally self-harming may be present. These behaviours often stop oncethe person starts addressing the gender issues but may need additional intervention ifthere is long-term dependency. Self-harming can continue to occur if there is acontributory psychiatric condition present in which case additional professional support toengage with the self-harming may be necessary on a longer-term basis.2.2.3 DiagnosisThe Department of Health has explicitly stated that being trans is ‘not a mental illness’(Department of Health, 2007). However, some psychiatric nosologies do include diagnosesthat would fall under the broad rubric of Trans. Transsexualism is defined in the ICD 10 as astrong and on-going cross-gender identification, i.e. a desire to live and be accepted as amember of the opposite sex. There is a persistent discomfort with anatomical sex and asense of inappropriateness in the gender role of that sex. There is a wish to have hormonaltreatment and surgery to make one’s body as congruent as possible with one’s psychologicalsex (WHO, 2000, p.215) (ICD 10. F64.0). Many trans people who fit this description dodescribe themselves as transsexual, however not all are comfortable with this label.Psychologists need to be careful in using popular terms to describe trans people whichmight be reclaimed and used by a community about themselves, but considered highlyoffensive if used by others (cf Kennedy 2003). Thus a person who may fulfil therequirements of the ICD 10 coding for Transsexualism, and who may be referred to as a26 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients‘Trans woman’ when it is particularly pertinent, may generally be referred to as a woman.Generally it is considered respectful for trans people to be addressed using their preferredterms.‘Homosexuality’ was removed from the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in1973 and the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in 1992 but trans identitiesremain under both manuals as Gender Identity Disorder (DSM IV-TR) and Transsexualism(ICD-10). ‘Gender Identity Disorder (GID)’ is defined in the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR, American Psychiatric Association, 2000) as ‘strongand persistent cross-gender identification and a persistent discomfort with the sex and asense of the inappropriateness of gender role’. Individuals experience their ‘genderidentity’ (psychological sense of self as male or female) as being incongruent with theirphenotype. This categorisation as a mental disorder is viewed as pathologising by manytrans people and professionals (trans and non-trans) involved in trans health care andresearch. The ‘Childhood’ categories of these ‘disorders’ are considered by many tocontinue to pathologise young trans people as well as some LGB people and others who donot express stereotypical gendered behaviour in childhood (Piontek, 2006).Many lay trans people, along with many professionals (trans and non-trans) working in thefield strongly challenge the psychiatric categorisations of transsexuality and transvestism.Removing Transsexualism and Gender Identity Disorder and Transsexualism from DSM-IVand ICD-10 raises more complicated issues than was the case with ‘homosexuality’. Theseissues, for example, include access to trans specific medical interventions, funding issuesand access to resources. Further information on the debate in this area can be found in(Karasic & Drescher 2005; Richards 2007). It is recommended that psychologists seeingtrans people presenting with stories fitting these diagnostic categories do not assume themto have a mental disorder and need to be proactively careful not to pathologise transidentities. Many people who have reassigned gender do not have a trans identity seeing themselves asjust men and women whose natally socially assigned gender role was incongruent with theirgender identity. They identify as men or women who have always been their sociallyreassigned gender. They may be clients with an atypical gender history but will not welcomeimposed or assumed labels or political identities. Others may have trans identities that arecomplex (e.g. Richards, 2009) and informed by a knowledge and interest in LGBT politics. Gender Reassignment refers to changing social gender role and often taking feminising ormasculinising hormone treatment and having surgery to alter the body to be morecongruent with the gender identity. Not all trans people who change gender role will electfor hormonal treatment or gendital reassignment surgery (Eyler, 2007). Those who do,seek the services of health professionals who specialise in the area. Once it has becomeapparent that the issue is specifically a trans issue and that the client would like to considera physical intervention, the client should be referred on to a Gender Identity Clinic. In linewith the World Professional Association for Transgender Health standards of care(WPATH, 2011) it is not always required for a client to have had a course of counselling orpsychotherapy before physical interventions are undertaken; rather the client must meetcertain criteria (see below and Barrett, 2007) and be assessed and counselled by twospecialist clinicians, with time between assessments, commonly at least three months. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 27It is useful for psychologists to appreciate the potentially difficult relationship betweensome trans people and health professionals who may act as ‘gatekeepers’ to treatment (for example, for trans people who reject pathologising diagnostic labels andpsychiatric/psychological discourse, but are seeking NHS care including hormonalmedication and/or gender reassignment surgery) (Hale, 2007). Historically some transindividuals have been thought to embellish or limit personal history information in orderto obtain desired treatments by fitting the history to standard clinical histories to elicit aquick diagnosis (Rosario, 2004). This dates back to when treatment paths were morerestrictive, the separation of gender identity and sexual orientation less clearly understoodand trans people were in a more disempowered social position, some using theirknowledge of the medical literature to provide clinical histories most likely to elicit accessto hormonal and surgical treatments. Trans clients are often well-informed, with manyfitting the profile of ‘expert’ patients, and now tend to be more challenging and proactivein their own treatment decisions and the relationship is rightly becoming morecollaborative between clinician and client. (Lenihan & Hegarty, 2007). The powerimbalance, inherent in the way in which dominant discourses frame and limit thediscussion and the subsequent decision-making, may be best avoided by building acollaborative relationship with the trans client. Stressing that the gatekeeping role is onewhich very few professionals are involved in, unless of course that is explicitly thepsychologist’s role, the purpose of the therapy is not a gatekeeping one. As with LGB identities, it would be useful for psychologists seeing trans clients to educatethemselves about trans experiences and terminology (Goethals & Schwiebert, 2005). Somebasic information is included here but psychologists ideally should seek further training.Whilst it can be necessary at times to identify natally assigned sex alongside gender this canbe done in a sensitive way. Referring to a trans person generally as ‘male to female’ or‘female to male’ or as ‘a female to male transsexual’ or ‘a male to female transsexual’ canbe considered offensive. Trans people are occasionally referred to in clinical reports asfemale to male (FTM) or male to female (MTF). In formal medical and psychologicalreports and documentation it sometimes causes confusion if someone is only referred to asa trans woman or trans man, so (FTM) or (MTF) may be added afterwards. This shouldnot be necessary where this abbreviation is not relevant. The terms trans man and transwoman alone are becoming increasingly used as these recognise the continued genderidentity throughout life. Psychologists are advised always to question whether it is necessary to identify someone’sgender history in their communication with others unless specifically requested by theclient or it is essential to their health care. Under the UK Gender Recognition Act (2004)people who have received a gender recognition certificate have the legal status of theirpreferred sex (e.g. the right to marry) whether or not they have undergone surgery. If someone holds this certificate, the information that they are trans is protected andpassing on this information or allowing it to be made available to others without consent isa criminal offence. This offence is an ‘absolute offence’ meaning that no excuse isacceptable. For example, explaining that the records system requires specific informationwill still result in a criminal conviction. The authors would suggest familiarisation with theGender Recognition Act 2004 and Section 5 of The Gender Recognition (Disclosure ofInformation) (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) Order 2005, or at the very least28 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientstaking legal advice prior to communicating this information. The psychologist should alsoassume that a trans person holds a Gender Recognition Certificate (and consequently isprotected under the Act), rather than asking them to provide it (cf Barrett 2007). 2.2.4 Gender Identity ClinicsPeople with gender dysphoria can present at any stage of their lives seeking the services ofspecialist health professionals and can have a diversity of presentation. They may or maynot want hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery, or not all the surgicaloptions available. Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic (CHX GIC) is the National UKGender Identity Clinic where the majority of trans people seeking NHS health care servicesfor specifically trans issues that cannot be dealt with in a general setting, such as specialistsurgery, will be referred. On arrival at CHX GIC each referred client will be offered twoinitial assessment appointments with two different GIC Consultants(Psychiatrist/Psychologist). There are then follow-up consultations with their primaryConsultant. The Consultant Endocrinologist oversees all hormone treatment and seesclients in clinic as necessary. Referral can also be made to a Specialist Senior SpeechTherapist on the team. For some clients these consultations will not involve a Real LifeExperience. For those clients seeking gender reassignment they include support andendorsement for medical interventions prior to, through and after a two year Real LifeExperience. Therapeutic group sessions and individual counselling psychology are alsoavailable.The Real Life Experience (RLE) is the formal transition of gender role for a specifiedperiod of time, usually a minimum of one to two years, before assessment for genderreassignment surgery. Clients will also have consultations around feminising ormasculinising hormone therapy. If they start hormone therapy after discussion of the risks,effects and ongoing monitoring, their hormone therapy will be regularly reviewedthroughout their care. Reproductive issues should always be discussed prior to startinghormone therapy and storage of ova or sperm offered. Referrals for speech therapy will bemade for those clients who desire this service. Funding for facial hair removal is requestedfor trans women, but is currently subject to local Primary Care Trust decision, as is genitalarea hair removal if recommended prior to genital reassignment surgery for trans women.Facial hair removal for trans women is usually by electrolysis, laser treatment or IntensePulsed Light (IPL). 2.2.5 SurgeryGender reassignment surgeries can include for a trans man:● bilateral mastectomy with male chest reconstruction ● phalloplasty (creation of phallus) ● metoidioplasty (creation of micropenis) ● urethroplasty (creation of urethra) ● scrotoplasty (creation of scrotum) and placement of testicular prosthesis ● implantation of penile prosthesis ● vaginectomy (removal of vagina) ● salpingo-oophrectomy (removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes) and ● hysterectomy. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 29Trans women may have:● a penectomy (removal of penis)● orchidectomy (removal of testes)● vaginoplasty (construction of neovagina)● labioplasty (construction of labia) and ● clitoroplasty (creation of clitoris). Some trans women who elect for genital surgery have the penectomy, labioplasty andclitoroplasty but do not want the neovagina or are unable to have a vaginoplasty on healthgrounds. Some trans women may also want chondroplasty (‘Adam’s Apple’ reduced), or after completing speech therapy with unsatisfactory results seek cricothyroidapproximation (vocal cord surgery). 2.2.6 Trans SexualitiesTrans people can identify as gay, heterosexual, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, or queer, etc., and may have multiple sexual identities. Sexual identity is usually associated with thegender identity, and it is recommended that the client is given the space to define theirsexual identity prior to any assumptions being made. For example, a natally assigned malewith a female gender identity may present in a male gender role and describe themselvesas being attracted exclusively to women. Sexual identity may be lesbian. The sex of any partner of the patient bears no predictable relation to outcomes of genderreassignment and should not be considered to be a measure for its effectiveness (Green et al., 1996). Some trans clients may experience confusion around sexual orientation andidentity at some stage in their lives and seek counselling or psychotherapy. A change ingender role can change how society views their partnership or sexual orientation. Partnersmay have to re-negotiate their relationship and the non-trans partner can feeluncomfortable if previously they believed themselves to be in a heterosexual relationshipand now they are in a partnership with someone of the same sex. They may not want to besocially perceived as gay or bisexual. This can affect the couple’s friendships, extendedfamily relationships and the future of the relationship. Sexuality may also be something that a client would wish to explore in therapy. As bodieschange sexuality and sexual expression can change also. People may become aware ofbeing attracted to a different gender to pre-transition, or their preference towards onegender increasing (Lawrence, 2005; Daskalos 1998). They may become more relaxed intheir changing bodies and more confident that prospective sexual partners perceive themas the gender congruent with their gender identity. Trans people may also be unsure as tohow to gain pleasure from their own bodies and to interact with others in a sexual way witha social identity and body that differs from the one they have been socialised with. It should be remembered that trans people often do not have the socialisation thatcisgendered (non-trans) people have in their preferred gender, and consequently areexpected to spring fully formed into an adult gender role in their preferred identity. Sometrans people may encounter challenges and difficulties in gender performance for a shortwhile after transition. Some organisations and websites offer advice and support. Thissupport should only be offered if the trans person expresses a wish for it. Many transpeople settle into a comfortable role quite quickly after having tried out various options. 30 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients2.2.7 ‘Cross Dressing’Cross Dressing is a term used to describe someone who dresses in clothes commonly wornby another sex. For example, someone who identifies as female may wear clothes moreusually worn by people who identify as male. Clearly what is and is not ascribed asbelonging to one sex is culturally determined and will vary over time along with fashion. In common with many of the items in this guide cross dressing has long been consideredto be psychopathological in its own right and is no longer considered to be. However,diagnoses do remain in the DSM and ICD. These diagnoses should not be used topathologise. Any distress caused by these behaviours should be attended to, assessing withthe client where the problem really lies, as often it can be concerns around friends, family,or social judgements, etc.Within the psychiatric nosologies ‘Fetishistic Transvestism’ is defined in ICD 10 as ‘thewearing of clothes of the opposite sex principally to obtain sexual excitement and to createthe appearance of the person of the opposite sex’ defined as differing from ‘transsexualtransvestism’ ‘by its clear association with sexual arousal and the strong desire to removethe clothing once orgasm occurs and sexual arousal declines’. It is described as sometimesoccurring as an earlier stage of Transsexualism. ‘Dual role transvestism’ is described as ‘thewearing of clothes of the opposite sex for part of the individual’s existence in order toenjoy the temporary experience of membership of the opposite sex, but without any desirefor a more permanent sex change or associated surgical reassignment, and without sexualexcitement accompanying the cross-dressing’ (ICD 10). The authors consider that these diagnostic categories are clearly pathologising in definingcross-dressing (wearing the traditional clothes of the opposite gender) as a ‘GenderIdentity Disorder’ (cf Lev, 2005; Richards & Barker, 2012). Some trans people do lead adual role lifestyle, and of these some move into a transsexual pathway, and of these asignificant proportion may have always sought hormonal and surgical gender reassignmentand/or identified as Transsexual. ‘Fetishistic transvestism’ is often thought to describe a natally assigned man who alwaysrequires to be cross-dressed for sexual arousal, but the majority of people who cross-dressdo not fall into this category. Cross-dressing may vary in frequency from daily, a few times aweek to a few times a year depending on opportunity and inclination. Cross-dressing often starts in childhood and as a result of social stigma, and the awarenessthat others will incorrectly see them as having a mental health problem, it may be hiddenfor years. The child can feel isolated, ‘abnormal’ and inauthentic, affecting relationshipswith friends and family (Lev, 2005; Richards & Barker, 2012; Hill, Rozanski, Carfagnini &Willoughby, 2005). In adulthood people can purchase their own clothing but still may keepit secret and disclose to partners and spouses only after the relationship has started,although people often gain confidence over time in discussing their cross-dressing withnew partners. A supportive new partner not infrequently is the catalyst which enables themto increase their time cross-dressed and go out in public in their chosen persona. Hidingcross-dressing from friends and family, and coming out to them about cross-dressing can beaccompanied by shame, guilt and fear of rejection. For those clients who do enjoy wearingeroticised clothing frequently in sexual activity and seek professional help, again it is usefulto explore with them where the problem lies and for whom it is a problem. In the pastPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 31there have also been legitimate concerns around being incarcerated in a psychiatrichospital or being seen as mad (e.g. Marks & Gelder, 1967). The media have oftenreinforced this simply incorrect stereotyping by portraying trans people as sad, mad or bad,or not uncommonly all three. In the 21st century the term ‘cross-dressing’ is itself starting to seem outdated. Trans menoften wear androgynous, unisex or masculine clothing from childhood, or for years priorto a social gender role transition, without encountering excessive social comment. Transwomen are more likely to appear to be wearing female clothes if the overall presentationeffect is female, but again can wear androgynous, unisex and odd feminine-appearingitems of clothing, jewellery and make-up without this being the case, which many are awareof if they are still being perceived socially as male and want to partially express their femaleside without changing gender role. General social dress is often not gender specific. Sometrans people would argue logically that for them it has been wearing the stereotypicalclothes of the natally assigned gender role which has been the real cross-dressing. 2.2.8 Trans parents Trans parents may have concerns around the effects of their being trans or of a gender roletransition on their children and/or partners. Parenting issues may need addressing over asignificant period of time. Although trans is not in itself a sufficient or necessaryrequirement to involve support agencies, there may nevertheless be a need for suchinvolvement, which as always should wherever possible be with the full support of theclient. The psychologist making provision at times to see other family members with theclient is often appreciated, as family support resources can be very limited in many areas.The reaction of children to a parent disclosing they are trans and/or transitioning genderrole can vary widely and be influenced by age. Younger children seem to find it easier toaccept than teenagers, but that would also be true of many parental decisions and changes.There is no doubt that the disclosure can be very distressing for some children but thedegree and quality of adult support can go a long way towards relieving this distress overtime. The attitude of the non-trans parent is extremely important here. Pre-adolescentchildren whose parents change gender role and divorce have been found to fare less wellthan those who stay together. They are not found however to fare less well than childrenwhose parents divorce for other reasons. Divorce and separation seem to be the risk factorshere, not the changing of gender role (Barrett, 2007).2.2.9 Trans youth and their familiesThere is a great deal of contention in the professional literature about the correcttreatment of young people who show atypical gender behaviours (WPATH, 2011; RoyalCollege of Psychiatrists, 2006; Gooren & van de Waal, 2007). Like all the other groups inthis document, young people with gender atypical behaviours may well present forcounselling for issues unrelated with their gender. The many issues attendant to growingup will be present with this client group. With specific regard to engaging with gender atypical behaviours there are some peoplewho take the view that all gender presentations should be encouraged, as the genderdichotomy is not inherently ‘right’ and indeed has caused a great deal of harm to manypeople. Some more radical versions of this stance insist that gender freedom of expressionshould be the case irrespective of the cost to the young person in terms of personal distress32 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsdue to bullying and social disapprobation, etc., as the benefit to society as a wholeoutweighs this personal cost in terms of the deconstitution of the gender binary.The alternative view supports the gender binary, believing that interventions should beaimed at facilitating young people in adhering to the sex roles that accord with theirassigned sex. In this way it is argued distress will be lessened as the young person will beable to blend in with others of the same anatomical configuration.A middle ground can be for young people expressing more severe gender dysphoria to beoffered a series of staged treatments, much as in the case of adult clients, in order ofincreasing irreversibility. With young people there is also the option of stopping pubertyusing Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Analogue (GnRHa) in order that the youngperson has a chance to mature, and they have a chance to consider if gender reassignmentis really something they wish to pursue. A sequence of treatment might look something likethis:1. Exploratory counselling and psychological input.2. Change of living arrangements to reflect the young person’s preferred gender.3. Administration of GnRHa.4. Administration of Cross Sex Hormones.5. Gender Reassignment Surgeries.Throughout stages 2 to 5, and afterwards if necessary, there will be ongoing supportivecounselling and psychological input. There is also the option for any stage to last as long asis deemed necessary by the patient, family and clinical team. All the stages other thanGnRHa may also be the final stage, again if this is deemed necessary by the patient, familyand clinical team. Some patients may be unable to undertake certain treatments due tophysical reasons, for example if someone has a cardiac problem they may not be a viablecandidate for surgery. Different clinics and clinicians have different ideas about when each of these stages shouldbegin. For example, in the Netherlands’ national clinic (University Hospital, Utrecht) forthe treatment of trans related issues GnRHa may begin quite early in puberty at TannerStage 2 (cf. Richards 2007, 2008). This is also the stage recommended by the WorldAssociation for Transgender Health, formerly HBIGDA (HBIGDA, 2000, p.10). Whereas inthe Portman Clinic – the usual place for English referrals – GnRHa has been prescribedmuch later in puberty at Tanner Stage 5 (See below). GnRHa cannot be used indefinitelyas the delay of puberty decreases bone mineral density, which can lead to brittle bones.The issue at contention, then, is how early one can tell if a person will continue to requestgender related interventions, or to be gender dysphoric, in adulthood. It is suggested bysome that the majority of gender atypical young people will go on to be gay or lesbian,rather than trans people who are desirous of medical interventions. For this group it isimperative that no irreversible decisions are made, by them or others, that they will later goon to regret. Balanced against that is the desire to curtail puberty early in those that willcontinue with their trans identity in order that they can be provided with cross sexhormones and surgery early and so inhabit a body that best accords with their genderidentity. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 3334 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsIt is suggested that clinicians working psychologically with children are aware of the broadspread of non-problematic behaviours shown by young people that may have, in the past,been deemed to be gender atypical. It is now quite usual for girls to play football, whereasthis was not the case as little as twenty years ago. It may also be the case that a behaviour isdeemed to be a gender atypical behaviour, but is actually related to an entirely differentissue, For example, a young boy’s father may be concerned that his son is ‘sissy’ oreffeminate because he is not keen on rough and tumble sports, but this is not properly agender issue, rather it is a sporting one. It follows then that it is incumbent on the clinician to determine, if the behaviour is indeedatypical, if the behaviour is actually a problem, and if so for whom? There is no reason that gender atypical behaviour that is not causing distress bediscouraged, or pathologised. If the behaviour is causing mild distress the clinician shouldbe reassuring to the young person and their carers and ideally have familiarisation with thediversity of gender present in culture (Herdt, 1996) and nature (Roughgarden, 2004).Interventions should not be aimed at this stage at changing the behaviour of the youngperson to be conforming to a cultural norm, but rather should be of a supportive nature tothe young person and the network of support that surrounds them, such as their familyand school. If the distress is marked then referral should be sought to a specialist in achildhood gender dysphoria clinic, where more intensive interventions can be given,possibly with a view to medical interventions. Specialist clinics and practitioners can varyon protocol, the UK protocol has been somewhat more cautious in this regard than theNetherlands. 2.2.10 UK Treatment of Gender Dysphoria in children and adolescents‘Gender Dysphoria’ in children and adolescents is a clinical term that is used to describesomeone who is so distressed about the incongruity of their sex and gender identity thatthey seek physical treatments to remedy this. For most children, gender dysphoric andotherwise, gender awareness develops early, commonly as children become socialisedaround the age of three (La Freniere, Strayer & Gauthier, 1984). At this point childrenwho feel differently from others of the same sex and who prefer playing with children ofthe opposite sex may become negatively labelled. As their preference for games andplaymates of the opposite sex continues into later school years, family and school staff maybecome concerned that they are different and the child can become stigmatised or bullied.Supporting a child’s gender development is important since gender identity is connectedwith all aspects of identity development, including a child’s sense of self and confidence. A sense of being different and of not conforming to stereotypical gender roles may emergeat any point in development. As secondary sexual characteristics emerge at the time ofpuberty, distress is frequently encountered. Young people whose gender identity is not inline with their biological sex find their changing body a cause of considerable distress andconfusion. Supporting the young person as they encounter such physical changes andresponses is imperative to their wellbeing.These young people unhappy with their gender can feel trapped in the wrong body withthe only solution being to change their body. Related aspects of identity, such as sexualityand changes in relationships associated with physical development, may be usefullyconsidered and explored; particularly since clinical experience and research has foundthat the majority of pre-pubertal young people who are referred to services for gender donot go on to change their bodies through surgery. In one long-term follow-up study in agender service many of the children referred later identified as gay or bisexual, but nottrans (Green, 1987).Helping young people and their families to consider a broader range of outcomes thanchanging their bodies is one of the therapeutic aims of psychotherapeutic assessment andintervention (De Ceglie & Freedman, 1998). However, this approach does not precludeeventual physical interventions if these are indicated. This approach is also recommendedby national and international guidance on working with young people who are unhappy intheir gender (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1998; Harry Benjamin International GenderDysphoria Association, 2001). Engaging family members, particularly parents and carers is important to promoteunderstanding and open communication about feelings and difficulties and avoid secrecyand shame (De Ceglie & Freedman, 1998). Since bullying and stigma is a significant risk inyoung people, also important is liaising with the systems and organisations surrounding theyoung person and their family, such as schools and other health or social careprofessionals. A range of toolkits and leaflets have been developed to increase awareness ofgender issues in schools (e.g. Press for Change, and Gender Identity Research andEducation Society [GIRES]). Additionally, network meetings which aim to find solutions toparticular challenges, such as which toilet to use and which PE kit to wear can be useful(De Ceglie & Freedman, 1998) to facilitate acceptance and support.Psychological interventions also aim to evaluate, in a collaborative way betweenprofessionals and young people and their families, the persistence of the diagnosticcategory of Gender Identity Disorder (APA, 2000a)Young people who have significant and enduring gender identity difficulties and who meetthe diagnostic criteria for Gender Identity Disorder (APA, 2000a) may requirepharmacological intervention such as GnRHa to provide a period without the influence oftheir biological sex hormone. Although, young people and families can find a psychiatricdiagnosis difficult; currently this is necessary in order to secure funding for specialistresources, although it should be unnecessary to refer to it in any great depth during theordinary course of counselling, psychotherapy or general psychological input. The decisionto pursue pharmacological intervention should be made with the young person,parents/carers and multi-disciplinary teams as per professional guidance (Royal College ofPsychiatrists, 1998; WPATH, 2011). A stage approach is recommended in terms of physicalintervention. The stages progress through reversible interventions, moving on, ifappropriate, to partially reversible and finally to irreversible interventions in adulthood(after the age of 18 years). Whilst there are differences between guidelines and standards ofcare in relation to the timing of intervention, they all support the combination ofpsychological, social and physical interventions, when appropriate, as the best therapeuticapproach for a carefully assessed and selected number of young people.It is important to note that the treatment of Gender Identity Disorder (APA, 2000a) inyoung people is largely experimental. In Europe there are only two countries (Britain andThe Netherlands) that provide a specialised service for young people. Research evidencefor the treatments adopted is still limited, although currently being developed.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 35As the objective of changing the body to adapt it to an enduring and stable cross genderidentity is a long term process with a number of stages, it inevitably carries with it a certaindegree of frustration. Therapeutic help is also aimed at helping trans-gendered youngpeople to bear this frustration without becoming involved in behaviours which are self-destructive, and to have adequate time to think through and assimilate the interventions todate.2.2.11 Diversity of sex developmentThe majority of people, regardless of age, race and sexuality, take entirely for granted thatthere are only two types of bodies – male or female. In reality, many people are born withbody parts that are male-typical, female-typical, both or neither. Here are just a fewexamples.Some women are born without a womb, cervix and vagina but with healthy ovaries andtherefore do not require exogenous hormones to maintain health. Some boys have theirurethral opening at the base of the shaft of the penis rather than the tip. Some men have asingle testis, and some have testes that are ‘vanishing’. Some babies present ambiguousgenitalia at birth, rendering it difficult for doctors and parents to assign sex; and some ofthese babies require lifetime steroidal management for survival. Some girls look typicallyfemale from birth then do not menstruate in their teens, only to find that they haveabdominal testes instead of ovaries, womb and vagina as expected, with a chromosomalmake-up typical for males. Some men look male-typical then upon fertility investigationsfind that they have a uterus and ovarian tissue and are potentially capable of menstruation.Some babies are born with their urogenital sinus outside the abdomen and, amidst otherfeatures, present two incomplete sets of genitalia; once associated with 100 per centmortality, multiple operations and treatment regimes nowadays enable the majority toreach adulthood.Advances in bio-technology have contributed to the identification of an increasing numberof genetic causes for non-standard sex characteristics. Some of these conditions used to becalled ‘hermaphroditism’ (see Dreger et al., 2005), however, this term is unhelpful to mostindividuals and does not provide a useful taxonomy for scientific research and medicaltreatment. The term ‘intersex’ (Hughes, 2002) has been coined, as well as more recently‘disorder of sex development’ (DSD) both commonly used in clinical settings and theliterature. These are umbrella terms that include a much broader range of diagnoses thatinclude all ‘congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal oranatomical sex is atypical’ (Hughes et al., 2006). It should be understood that all terms arepotentially pejorative and taxonomy could change. Within this document we have used theterms diversity of sex development, as well as non-normative sex development, and atypical sexcharacteristics. There are other more common situations associated with atypical sex characteristics thatfall outside the above definitions. These conditions may be congenital or acquired. For example, it is not uncommon for men with otherwise male-typical bodies to growbreasts. And, many women with otherwise female-typical bodies are capable of growingmore prominent facial hair. Furthermore, problems of pituitary function may inhibitspontaneous pubertal development in some boys and girls. And, for reasons not currentlywell understood, some boys and girls show signs of puberty in early childhood.36 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsAll skilled and reflexive psychological practitioners can contribute to the health and wellbeing of this broad client group. Whatever the specific medical diagnosis or biologicalbasis, psychosocially, people and close others thus affected share similar challenges. The key is to have a firm grasp of the major themes and develop a robust psychologicalresponse (see Liao & Boyle (2004) for an overview of key psychological perspectives), not to get lost in the complex if interesting biology.Diverse sex development may present in childhood or adulthood, sometimes alongsideother body differences or health problems. In case of childhood presentation, mostindividuals would have come under medical management. The paediatric specialists mostlikely to assume clinical responsibilities are paediatric endocrinologists and urologists.Where genital differences are detected, virtually all children with a known femalekaryotype are assigned female and feminising genital surgery usually ensues; children witha known male karyotype whose penis is absent or very small are also likely to be assignedfemale. (For an overview, please refer to Creighton & Liao, 2004.) Until relatively recently, patients discharged from paediatric services were lost to follow up,and little was known about how they fared in the adult world in terms of benefits andharms of corrective genital surgery, psychological well being, quality of life, relationshipsand parenthood outcomes. Although there are now a small number of designated adultclinics in the UK, people living with atypical sex characteristics may present to anypsychological service.2.2.12 Practice models and methodsDominant stories of ‘normality’ and ‘abnormality’ in the social world shape people’sexperiences of living with body differences. This also applies to living with diverse sexdevelopment conditions. Therapy models able to take account of the social context can beuseful for work in this field. However, although a robust personal identity may to someextent need to grow from alternative narratives of diverse sex development, thefundamental difficulties in creating entirely separate ideas and stories from the dominantones should be acknowledged in therapy.An important task, early on, is to engage with the client’s reality; shared attempts todeconstruct normalcy are only possible when founded on a strong therapeutic alliance.Any premature attempt at deconstruction, however well intentioned and skilfully carriedout, could make clients feel further diminished. People presenting diverse sexdevelopment conditions are not necessarily committed to sexual politics, and many do notfeel they have the personal resources to be catalysts in social change.Within a formulation that contextualises distress, a broader range of methods can beusefully applied, including techniques drawn on narrative, cognitive and behaviouralapproaches. Within this framework of technical eclecticism, the basis for selection isactuarial rather than theoretical, i.e. what works best from experience and availableliterature for similar types of problems of living (Norcross & Arkowitz, 1992).Individual face-to-face work tends to be the norm in psychological practice and this will betrue for people with diverse sex development. However, consultations may also be carriedout with couples and families. Groups are a useful forum for making apparent to theirparticipants diverse identities and positions, thereby deconstructing notions of normalcy.They can be an effective intervention for reducing distress (Weijenborg & Ter Kuile, 2000),Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 37though frequent attendance could be difficult due to the large geographical spread ofsome services.2.2.13 Engaging with patient needsAn important aspect of psychological work is to facilitate processing of the diagnostic andtreatment information in ways that are helpful to the individual or family. However, manypeople have never met a psychologist, thus the first questions may be concerned withthoughts and feelings about the consultation. In order for patients and parents to havegreater control of their health care, they need to become more expert about all aspects ofthe condition in question. But any of the following information, delivered in a clinicallanguage, can be shocking: ambiguous genitalia, absent vagina, absent menstruation,infertility, chromosomes, heredity, lifelong medication, hirsutism, obesity, and shortstature. An important first task then, is to develop a shared language with clients.Questions such as the following may be helpful for starting a discussion: ● What words would you use? ● Were these words given to you, by whom? ● Can you think of a different way of describing the situation? ● How should I say that? ● What’s the most challenging aspect of your situation to put into words? ● Can I check with you if I’ve got this right?Relating to the diagnosisAn important task even at the early stage is to help clients develop richer vocabularies anddrawing from alternative discourses aimed not only to increase medical knowledge but alsoto address the social, emotional and sexual aspects. Questions such as the following may behelpful for exploring the client’s understanding of the condition and, should they benecessary, treatment options: ● Can you tell me the name of the diagnosis? ● What kind of information have you been given about this? ● What other information would you like? The following questions may be helpful for extending the dialogue: ● These are some very clinical words, what do they mean to you?● What effects do these words have on you? ● How would you describe the way you’re feeling right now? ● Who is able to support you, and whose support would you like to seek? ● How do you see this affect how you feel about yourself (/child), or not? ● Is there another way of viewing the situation? ● In what way will your relationships change, in what way will they remain the same? ● How would you like other people to understand this?2.2.14 Psychological interventionAt any stage of the care episode, or independently from medical settings, people may seeksupport from a psychologist. When people do, there is sometimes a specific agenda, suchas managing self-disclosure, or decision-making regarding (more) complex treatment, orcounselling or psychotherapy for sexual difficulties. At other times, however, theconversations are more exploratory. The client may be the adult presenting with diversesex development, the couple affected by diverse sex development, or one or both parents38 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsof a child presenting with diverse sex development. Individuals may face very complexdecisions upon learning that they have a diverse sex development diagnosis concerningwhat to do about the information and how to decide about investigations and treatments.A most common concern relates to self-disclosure about non-normative sex developmentconditions in social and sexual contexts (Liao, 2003). Many feel challenged by ‘ethicaldilemmas’ about withholding information from significant others (e.g. sexual partners),and about the timing of information. Communicating to people about non-normative sexdevelopments may feel unsafe (e.g. ‘people would flip’), whilst withholding informationmay threaten personal integrity (e.g. ‘what kind of person does that make me?’).Information relating to infertility is often thought of as less risky to disclose thaninformation relating to a gender-incongruent karyotype (e.g. a self-identified female with akaryotype typical for males). Whereas a person can choose not to disclose in manysituations, given the physical signs, choosing not to disclose to sexual partners can bedifficult for some individuals, some of whom may withdraw from intimate relations inorder to avoid potential discussion.Early on, it may be important to enable clients to explore the difference between privacy,which all individuals are equally entitled to, and secrecy. People with diverse sexdevelopmental diagnoses should not feel obliged to share medical informationindiscriminately, any more than people with cancer, diabetes or sexual health problems.Some of these questions can help patients explore their feelings about disclosure: ● What kind of ideas do you have about sharing information with people? ● If you were to share something with one person, what and who would that be? ● How have you come to decide that? ● What other resources can you draw on? ● What are your hopes and fears? ● What could you say to let people know how you would like them to respond?For parents, information management is their responsibility. Provision of well timedinformation appropriate for different stages of development has been recommended(Carmichael & Ransley, 2002) but, without support, for many parents this is easier saidthan done. For the currently small proportion of parents who decide to defer correctivesurgery until their child can give consent, intensive professional and community supportmay be needed. These parents may need skills to educate not just the affected child butalso siblings and the extended family or wider community, to develop a more constructive,systemic approach for education about non-normative sex development.2.2.15 Medical/Surgical investigations and treatmentsWhere a gender boundary is blurred by characteristics deemed to belong to the ‘opposite’sex, individuals can become extremely preoccupied with fixing the problem. Many womenwith diverse sex development diagnoses speak of feeling like outsiders and feeling unentitledto relationships until they have had surgery to remove the obstacles for ‘normal sex’ (Boyle,Smith & Liao, 2005). When patients seek medical treatment, they may also be seeking‘normality’ in identity, relationships and sexual practices. Health professionals feel under agreat deal of pressure to ensure that diagnostic information simultaneously comes with offersof some form of a ‘corrective’ solution. But, whilst this may help to contain doctor andpatient anxiety, such action inadvertently comes with the subtext that body differences areunacceptable, indeed inconceivable. It is this subtext that is ultimately unhelpful.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 39Decision to undergo surgery is sometimes influenced by a perceived need for concealment.In these situations surgery can be an avoidant strategy, that is, avoidance of emotionalchallenges posed by body differences is accomplished via elimination of difference. It ispossible to further the client’s understanding of the benefits and limitations of anytreatment, for example, by asking: ● Can you repeat to me what the doctor has told you about the treatment? ● What do you understand to be the potential benefits? And risks?● Which aspects of your life are dependent on the operation? Which aspects are moreup to you? ● Who and what else can help you decide? ● What do you think the operation may not address? ● What else might be needed? ● Who and what else can help? The potential for some psychological approaches to enable patients to avoid certain formsof surgery has been clearly demonstrated (see Liao et al., 2006; Ismail-Pratt et al., 2007).However, these approaches would need to be endorsed by the multi-disciplinary team andclients’ engagement may need to be gently negotiated.With technical advances and the privileging of genetic research in Western sciences, therace to discover genes that cause non-normative sex development is on. The impact ofgenetic testing on family relationships is seldom attended to, and quality psychosocialsupport is seldom planned for. It is strongly recommended that psychologists providingcare for people with diverse sex development conditions also liaise closely with medicalresearchers. A well informed psychological opinion can be invaluable and this can be madeavailable even if the psychologist is working outside the specialist context, for example, in a service based in the community.Health professionals’ behaviours can be expected to be highly influential on their patient’ssense making of the situation. Preoccupation with the non-standard sex characteristic, withan eagerness to correct what is portrayed as an aberration, could inadvertently set off anegative chain reaction in the individual and close others. Avoidance may become themost common end point, when preparation to confront bodily differences might havebeen a more adaptive strategy (Simmonds, 2004). It is important to explore both thepositive and the less positive aspects of health care transactions, and to identify the impactthis might have on current adjustment.Non-normative bodies fascinate clinicians and researchers – including psychologists.Intimate examination, medical photography or indeed psychological research may nothave been optimally managed from the client’s perspective. If there have been adverseexperiences, the impact would require sensitive exploration. In her detailed study withclinical experts involved in medical management of children with non-normative sexdevelopment, Kessler (1998) concluded that whilst most doctors claimed that parents wereequal partners in decision making regarding sex assignment and corrective surgery, shecould not elicit from them clear examples of parental participation. Furthermore,inadequate psychological support at these times is likely to compromise parents’ capacityto take into account and prioritise the child’s potential future issues.40 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients2.2.16 Experiences and impact of family transactionsAdults with diverse sex development conditions suggest that parents need to ‘come toterms’ with the diagnoses themselves in order to help their children. Indeed theimportance of open communication between parents, children and doctors in adaptationhas been emphasised across medical contexts. When presented with a child with non-normative sex development parents can be expected to feel extremely confused andemotionally vulnerable. ‘Coming to terms’ may require sustained support, for coping withlosses and fears and for examining our taken-for-granted beliefs about ‘normal sexuality’and ‘normal life’.Many parents choose cosmetic surgery to ‘correct’ genital differences in infants andchildren with non-normative sex development. But whilst the alleviation of parentaldistress is often cited as a major reason for medically non-essential childhood surgery, it isnot clear to what extent such surgery mitigates distress or doubt over the sex of the child(Wilson & Reiner, 1998).For the children, multiple visits to hospitals, absences from school, treatment regimens,parental anxiety, invasion of personal privacy, pain and discomfort, and evasive responsesto questions can impact upon socialisation. There can be other repercussions for thefamily as a whole. Financial hardship may result as one parent gives up work. Siblings whohave to be repeatedly ‘farmed out’ to other caretakers may be emotionally distressed. Thepsychological well-being of all family members and their relationships with each other maybe negatively strained, with potentially long lasting consequences. Psychologists can have amajor role in prevention.2.2.17 SexualityPeople with non-normative sex development may identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay,heterosexual or any other sexuality. Research suggests that lesbian relationships are morecommon in some diagnostic groups compared to the general population. Regardless ofpartner preference, sexual difficulties are more common (Minto et al., 2003) compared togeneral population norms. Difficulties identified include: reduced sexual interest (Zuckeret al., 1996), sexual anxiety (May, Boyle & Crouch, 1996), impaired genital sensitivity(Crouch et al., 2008) and poor genital appearance outcome of often multiple operationsthat have begun in early childhood (Creighton, Minto & Steele, 2001).Within therapy a move in focus away from ‘normal sex’ and an increased emphasis insensuality and pleasure rather than gendered performance, can offer some clients greaterscope for pleasure as they explore what works best for them and to become more open toopportunities for good-enough sexual enjoyment and relating (Liao, 2007). Thustherapeutic exploration might focus on the developmental trajectories of the following(not in any particular order): 1. gender positioning of self; 2. gender(s) of preferred partners; 3. body perceptions; 4. sexual concerns and experiences – actual and fantasised; 5. sexual and relationship aspirations; and 6. knowledge and attitude relating to a range of sexual activities.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 41Therapy may also work towards one or more of the following goals: 1. expanding a shared understanding of past and present influences on the identifiedproblem(s); 2. increasing awareness of variations in male and female sexualities and de-centralisingheteronormative sex; 3. increasing control over social and sexual situations; 4. self-permission to explore a range of sexual activities – alone or partnered – with orwithout erotic material or mechanical aids; 5. self-permission not to pursue sexual activities where there is no identifiable barrierother than an absence of desire or even a wish to desire.Through shifts in emphasis, it may be possible for some individuals to begin to validate arange of consensual sexual activities (or inactivity) that has otherwise been constructed asinadequate or abnormal.The presence of non-normative physical sex characteristics de-stabilises gender, and genderinsecurity can profoundly shape choices in contexts across the lifespan. The importance ofpsychological support for people with non-normative sex development is frequentlyalluded to, even more so by doctors and patients than by psychologists. However, itsdelivery – remit, scope, theories, methods, accountability – is seldom coherently articulatedor adequately resourced, perhaps, at least partly, because it is not obvious how such workmay fit with the centrality of corrective treatment and concealment.With new resources being developed to tackle the issues at grass root (e.g. Error!Hyperlink reference not valid.) and more psychologists making a firmer commitment topeople with diverse sex development conditions beyond theoretical research, futuregenerations of psychologists can expect to contribute more usefully to the lives of peopleaffected by non-normative sex development.42 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsExample interventionDan was a 26-year-old man presenting a pre-pubertal hypogonadism syndrome. Thismeans that he had not gone into puberty spontaneously. He struggled to talk about hisdifficulties; he felt very ashamed about his body, in particular his breast development,sparse body hair and smaller than average-sized penis. He had been teased and bulliedat school, which he left at the earliest opportunity. He had never dated, although therehad been opportunities. During therapy, self re-storying was pursued where Dan’s exclusive focus on ‘deficits’was transformed into partial owning of some abilities. Also, hopes and fears aboutcommunicating with potential partners about any perceived physical differences wereexplored, and alternative ways of thinking about the situation were identified andrehearsed during sessions.Five months and six meetings on, Dan returned to say that his mood had lifted, thoughhe still did not consider himself ‘confident’. He had met a woman and fixed their thirddate. He had not told her about his condition and was apprehensive about it, thoughhe was excited about the dating and determined to continue with it.2.3 Other sexual practices and identitiesAs mentioned above some regard the sexual practices they take part in as (key) aspects oftheir identity, whilst others may see them as behaviours rather than integral parts of whothey are. Here we consider some of the main practices which may be important for sexualand gender minority clients.2.3.1 BDSMBDSM is considered to be a criminal activity in the UK if it causes the infliction of bodilyharm. Aspects of this situation continue to be controversial, as does the fact that sadismand masochism are listed in DSM-IV and ICD-10 despite evidence (Richters et al., 2008)that people in BDSM communities have no greater level of psychological problems thanthe general population. Many therapists hold negative assumptions about this sexualpractice (Bridoux, 2000) including, for instance, the ideas that it is based in early sexualtrauma and that it is abusive or psychologically harmful to the people who engage in it.Whilst, of course, any of these things may be true for particular individuals, the vastmajority of people who engage in these practices do so for the pleasure it affords and donot suffer any harm as a consequence (Moser & Levitt, 1995). There are, however,particular issues which may arise because this practice has been both criminalised andpathologised. For example, clients may present with concerns and confusion over theirsexual behaviour primarily due to stigma and stereotyping which exists around this issue. It is also worth noting that for others there may be no problem whatsoever and it maysimply be part of the broad sexual repertoire that they engage in. It is important not toascribe meaning beyond that provided by people with oppressed and stigmatised identitiesand practices such as these (Barker, Iantaffi & Gupta, 2008).Understanding of BDSM is broad and includes all sexual identities and practices involvingpain play, bondage, dominance and submission, and erotic power exchange. BDSM standsfor bondage and discipline, domination and submission, and sadomasochism, althoughsome shorten this just to SM or prefer the word ‘kinky’. Various words are used for thedifferent participants or positions in BDSM. Generally ‘sadist’, ‘dominant’, ‘dom/domme’,and ‘top’ are used for the person in the position of power or the one giving out thestimulation and ‘masochist’, ‘submissive’, ‘sub’, and ‘bottom’ are used for the person withless power or the one on the receiving end. A ‘switch’ is someone who takes both kinds ofroles. Often the words ‘dominant’ and ‘submissive’ are used for more psychological BDSM(e.g. that involving humiliation or servitude) and ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ for more physical(e.g. that involving pain or other sensations), although there is also often overlap betweenthe two. BDSM activity may be referred to as ‘play’ or a ‘scene’ and non-BDSM sex may betermed ‘vanilla’ (Langdridge & Barker, 2007).Many ‘BDSMers’ use the phrases Safe, Sane, Consensual and/or Risk Aware ConsensualKink to emphasise the importance of informed consent within their practices.Psychologists may encounter clients who are not happy with particular activities or feelthings have gone too far, and in such circumstances it is useful to help clients to negotiateboundaries and agreements which suit them (Barker et al., 2008).Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 432.3.2 Asexuality and celibacyAccording to Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), ‘an asexual is someonewho does not experience sexual attraction’. Many asexuals distinguish this from celibacy,which is seen as a choice rather than an inherent part of one’s sexuality. Some may engagein solo sex whilst others may have no sexual experiences at all. Bogaert (2004), in a nationalprobability study, found one percent of people to endorse the phrase ‘I have never feltsexual attraction to anyone.’ Particularly within the psychosexual therapeutic communitythere may be an assumption that sexual attraction and desire are a universal part of humanbeing, therefore, it is important to recognise that some may not experience themselves assuch. The website www.asexuality.org provides useful information on this topic.Asexuality may be distinguished from the ways in which some people may experiencethemselves as non-sexual during the process of coming out or transitioning. There aremany times in life when it is common to feel non-sexual, also many people decide not to besexual for political or religious reasons. Lack of sexual desire or arousal can beexperienced as a problem but may not necessarily be. Celibacy is an active choice to abstain from sexual practices which is particularly associatedwith membership of some religions. In a clinical context it is important to work with clientsto understand and respect their motivations for being celibate rather than view this asindicative of psychosexual problems. Whilst there are undoubtedly occasions when peoplechoose celibacy as a result of problems in relating or due to earlier sexual trauma this isnot necessarily the case as people may actively choose this option for a variety of reasonsunrelated to sexual or relationship difficulties and indeed even if people have sufferedsexual or relationship difficulties, celibacy may still be a positive choice which need not bethe focus of psychological intervention. 44 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsCase Study: A client presented having been seen by two previous therapists diagnosingsexual addiction because of his frequent visits to professional dominatrices. The clientpresented having been dissatisfied with his previous therapeutic experiences as he didnot feel he had an addiction but instead had problems with his current BDSMrelationship. For him, his presenting concern was clearly his current relationshipdifficulties and whilst he had frequented professional dominatrices for many years hethought this was his only option given his age, history and lack of knowledge about anyalternative ways of gaining the sexual satisfaction he desired. Comment: Putting aside the appropriateness of diagnosing clients, the other therapistsfailed to recognise the broader context involved in this client’s life. With littleknowledge of, or access to any BDSM scene, he perceived his visits as the only possibleoutlet for his particular sexual desires. Part of the therapeutic process involved thepsychologist and client working together to enable him to access virtual and real BDSMcommunities whilst also recognising that he may still wish to visit professionaldominatrices and that this may not be a problem for him and how he understands hissexuality.2.3.3 Solo sex, pornography, and eroticaMasturbation is still often pathologised and seen as less worthy than other forms of sex. In psychosexual therapy and sexual self-help books it is generally seen as part of a processtowards ‘proper’ sex: which is generally defined, heteronormatively, as penile-vaginalintercourse (Tiefer, 2004). However, masturbation (whether mutual or solo) constitutes amajor part of the sexual practices of many people (LGBTQ and heterosexual).Masturbation might be considered problematic or sinful by some cultural/religiousgroups. This links with the idea of sex for pleasure (in this case self-pleasure) being selfishor wrong. This view could make it difficult for clinicians working with clients using a sextherapy programme that would recommend masturbation as a step in self-learning andcontrol of one’s sexual responses. Clinicians could either forfeit this step, or some clientsmay be willing to use masturbation as part of the ‘treatment’ if it is put within a medicalframe – for example called ‘hand practice’ rather than ‘masturbation’. For example, thiscould be permissible in the same way that someone with diabetes regulated by food can eatduring Ramadan.Solo sex may also involve the use of pornography/erotica. Whilst legitimate concerns havebeen expressed around the objectification of women in much pornography/erotica,LGBTQ people frequently access pornography/erotica, much of which is producedspecifically for these communities. There is often widespread acceptance within LGBTQcommunities about the use of these materials and it may frequently form an integral partof people’s sexual practices.Pornography/erotica may be accessed, or produced, particularly in order to enable peopleto explore (often in creative ways) new and/or alternative sexual desires and possibilities.For example, there is an increasing amount of ‘slash’ fiction on the internet where authorsand readers write about same sex relationships between fictional characters from popularculture and may also use this to experiment with BDSM and other sexual practices at afantasy level (Barker, 2002). Use of online pornography, internet sex chat, and other typesof solo sex are, recently, being frequently pathologised under the label of ‘sex addiction’(Irvine, 2005). This may function as a continued stigmatisation and marginalisation ofLGBTQ groups, particularly a number of gay men, for whom this constitutes a major partof their sexual practice (Davies, Barker & Langdridge, in press).2.3.4 Sex workThere are a number of misconceptions about sex work. It is not illegal in the UK to sellsex, although national legislation and local by-laws impose many restrictions on it (Brooks-Gordon, 2006; Sanders, 2005). The profile of a person who sells sex may not comply withstereotypes of the vulnerable person who works in the street and is addicted to drugs.Much more paid sex takes place ‘indoors’, in private flats, saunas, or brothels, with moreand more people using the internet to advertise (Bernstein, 2007a; Bimbi, 2007; Sanders,2006). The needs of the client who presents as a sex worker will be dependent on anumber of factors influenced by their gender, sexual identities, gender identities,economic situation, age, race, nationality, migration status, relationship status, proximity todrug and alcohol use. Feelings of self-esteem, empowerment, and stigma will be keymediating factors to the client’s response between these variables and their needs fromtherapeutic intervention. The best advice to a psychologist who is seeing a client who hasPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 45presented as a sex worker is never make assumptions about the person’s background(Christina, 2004). The client who has presented as a sex worker will be more open toquestions than assumptions about their personal situation (Bernstein, 2007b). Whilst sex workers report being able to distinguish between sex-as-work from sexual-expression-of-intimacy, in the context of counselling, some may confuse professional carefor a more personal relationship if they are unused to emotional care without physicaldemands (Mai, 2008). Some may be more comfortable talking about sex than about theirpersonal lives, whilst others may be sexually aggressive to redress a perceived imbalance ofpower.2.3.5 Men who sell sexMost men who sell sex are hired by other men, since the female client base is small bycomparison. Whilst most men who sell sex to men identify as gay, some have a straight orbisexual identity in their personal lives, and are ‘gay for pay’ (Dorais, 2005). This maychange through their period of involvement in paid sex work, and some men may ‘comeout’ as bisexual or gay, whilst others will continue only to have sex for men for economicpurpose (Dorais, 2005). Some men do use sex work as a way of exploring their ownhomosexuality, justifying it through the financial benefits. Some young men may realisefinancial opportunities when they themselves are exploring the gay scene or public sexenvironments such as cruising grounds or public toilets (Mai, 2008).Clients may experience dissonance between their identity and their occupation, that is,between what they do and who they are. This may be true both for their sexual identities,and their identification as sex workers (Mai, 2008).Some men sell sex occasionally or part-time. Many have other employment in mainstreamjobs, or even professional careers. Most men sell sex because they have been faced withsome sort of financial crisis. Some men work in other areas of the ‘sex industry’ includingphotographic modelling, pornographic films, or stripping (Dorais, 2005). Issues of stigma tend to be common across all types of sex work and all profiles of sexworkers. Men who sell sex may either experience more stigma because of the doubletaboos of homosexuality (real or perceived) and selling sex; conversely, they mayexperience less stigma from gay men who may define ‘authentic intimacy’ differently(Morrison & Whitehead, 2007; Bernstein, 2007b).Some male sex workers will experience a level of esteem because of their physicalattributes, particularly their physique, penis, and face. Some young men who have not yetsold sex may aspire to become male escorts because they see the lifestyle as glamorous(Gaffney & Beverely, 2001). Men who have capitalised on their youthful looks and staminamay struggle with ageing (Dorais, 2005). Some sex workers may need help with an exit strategy from sex work, whilst others mayneed assistance with finding empowerment within their current situation (Gaffney &Beverely, 2001). Some sex workers may have experience of violence with clients (from ortowards). Issues of assertiveness may be paramount, particularly when the client isnegotiating boundaries of safer sex. Often, safer sex practices (condom use) will beforegone for financial compensation or whilst under the influence of drugs (Dorais, 2005;Jackson et al., 2005).46 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsSex workers who use condoms regularly in their professional lives may not do so in theirpersonal lives. This is one of a number of issues for sex workers who must negotiate paidsex as well as, or in secret from, their personal, intimate relationships (Jackson et al.,2005). Many male sex workers have personal romantic relationships with other men whosell sex. People who sell sex who have relationships with others who do not often havedifficulty gaining understanding of the contexts and meaning of sex within their personaland professional lives (Gaffney & Beverely, 2001). People who do not sell sex may havedifferent expectations from a relationship than a person who sells sex professionally(Gaffney & Beverely, 2001). People who sell sex in secret may not have disclosed the truenature of their professional activities to their partner, their families, or their friends(Morrison & Whitehead, 2007). For many sex workers, a primary concern is their fear ofbeing found out. Many sex workers use a pseudonym for their working relationships.Some sex workers will have multiple needs (eg drugs, homophobia, abuse). These needsare multiplied again if the person is foreign, as they may present issues of racism andxenophobia, alongside concerns about migration status (eg illegal migrants, migrants onholiday visas who are not permitted to work). Migrant sex workers may also feel the impactof assimilation into another culture. Cultural norms and attitudes may be quite different inthe client’s parent country, particularly if they are from religious or rural backgrounds(Mai, 2008).2.3.6 Lesbians and Bisexual Women who sell sexThe number of women selling sex to other women is relatively low. It is more likely that awoman who identifies as a lesbian in her personal life will be selling sex to men, as ‘straightfor pay’ (Shrage, 1999). Some women may have tentative or new feelings of same-sexattraction, which may or may not be related to their work (Gochros & Bidwell, 1996). Thisinvisibility may be seen as negative, as in wider considerations of lesbian invisibility, or as apositive method of managing stigma. Like other sex workers, these women may lead adouble life, to avoid the stigma of being labelled a ‘prostitute’ or a ‘whore’ (James, 1996).Some women may have identified as straight prior to taking up sex work, but developrelationships with other women as a way of separating their professional intimacies fromtheir personal relationships. Avoiding pregnancy will be a concern for women, as well assexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV (Jackson et al., 2005). Some womenhave children (Sanders, 2005). Issues of trafficking and coercion into sex work arereported to be much more common for women than for men (Agustin, 2007).2.3.7 Trans people who sell sexTrans men working as sex workers are comparatively rare. Trans women are much morecommon, particularly in some areas. Many trans women do sex work becausediscrimination has forced them to find alternative income, particularly during the initialstages of their transition if they are trans-sexual, or if they have difficulty ‘passing’ if theyare transvestites. Some people may have been forced out of home or housing. Many transwomen do sex work to pay for gender reassignment operations and related cosmeticsurgeries. Some will have issues with ‘passing’ as their new gender identity. People mayhave issues with body dysmorphia as well as gender dysmorphia. Others may not identifywith either a male or a female identity, and may wish to occupy an ‘other’ space that isneither male nor female. Additionally, they may feel pressure to conform to a single sexualidentity and ‘complete’ their transition through surgery, whilst paradoxically realising aPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 47higher market demand exists for ‘chicks with dicks’. Trans women sex workers have bothmale and female clients, although most are men.2.3.8 DragDrag (not to be confused with transvestism or transgender) encompasses drag queens anddrag kings. Drag queens are usually men who dress in a sterotypically female gender role,often exaggerating characteristics for dramatic effect. Drag kings conversely are usuallywomen who dress and may perform in a traditionally male gender role. ‘Faux’ or ‘Bio’queens are women who dress in the drag queen style and ‘faux’ kings are men who dress inthe drag king style. Drag is not necessarily for the purpose of performing. Drag events, such as drag balls andmore modern ‘drag races’, have long been a regular part of some social calendars. Formany years, such masquerade balls were the only opportunity for men to dress and behavea particular way in public (Cole, 2000). Drag queens have been a central part of thecommercial Western gay scene since its inception, although this may vary in different areasand eras. The drag king phenomenon is more recent and reasonably common in somemajor cities today. However, there are numbers of people who engage in drag in othercontexts, for instance for the pleasure it affords them personally or socially. Some dragqueens also identify as transvestites whilst, for most ‘transvestism’ and ‘drag’ are separatepursuits with quite separate identities (Bornstein, 1994). Drag king identities and practicesmay have some overlap with butch identities and be more focused on performativity ratherthan performance (Schacht & Underwood, 2005; Halberstam, 1998).2.4 Relationships2.4.1 Spaces for meeting (including internet spaces)Cottaging is a gay slang term referring to anonymous sex between men in a public lavatory.Cruising is a more general term for looking for potential partners, for example, in a wellknown area for meeting or a nightclub. Cottaging/cruising is engaged in for a variety ofreasons, not least of which is the pleasure it affords. It is commonly assumed that gay menengage in such practices because this is the only sexual outlet they can find. This may bethe case for some men, particularly those in isolated rural communities. However, it isimportant not to assume that this is the case for all. Many out gay men with access to acommercial gay scene will still cottage/cruise and not see this as a problematic aspect oftheir sexual behaviour.It is important to recognise that LGBTQ people are increasingly using the internet as theirprimary place for meeting and forging relationships, and, for many outside urban centres,for accessing communities. For example, the website ‘gaydar’ is an extremely popular placefor LGBTQ people to have a profile, to cruise and to meet other LGBTQ people. Thereare similar online sites for people who identity as bisexual BDSM and polyamorous. Thesesmaller groups who are often without a commercial scene are particularly likely to use theinternet to form and develop communities (Ritchie & Barker, 2006).2.4.2 Relationship formsWhilst, like heterosexuals, many LGBT people are involved in long term monogamous, orserially monogamous relationships, significant numbers of those in gay, bisexual, trans andto some extent, lesbian communities, are involved in openly non-monogamousrelationships (e.g. Adam, 2006; Klesse, 2005; Munsen & Stelboum, 1999). For example,48 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsnon-monogamy in the form of ‘fuck buddies’ and open relationships are well-establishedstories amongst gay men in the UK, with 56 per cent of UK gay men in openly non-monogamous relationships (Hickson et al., 1994). LGBTQ people are more likely to have‘open’ relationships rather than ‘secret infidelities’ (Nichols, 1990). Some have arguedthat open non-monogamy is more common in LGBTQ relationships because people arequestioning ‘the rules’ already around identity and this makes it more likely to questionother ‘rules’ around relating (Heaphy, Donovan & Weeks, 2004). The terms people use for relationships are different in different contexts. For example, gay men may be more likely to use the term ‘open relationships’ (Adam, 2004) whilstheterosexuals may be more familiar with ‘swinging’ (generally a relatively similarrelationship style involving sexual relationships outside a main couple and/or other peoplebeing brought into the couple for sex; DeVisser & McDonald, 2007). In bisexual, trans andlesbian communities the concept of ‘polyamory’ is more common, although this may bebecoming more widespread (Klesse, 2007). Polyamory refers to ‘a relationship orientationthat assumes that it is possible [and acceptable] to love many people and to maintainmultiple intimate and sexual relationships’ (Sexualities, 2003, p.126). There has been aproliferation of polyamorous communities and identities with the increase in internet usefrom the 1990s. Generally there is an emphasis on openness, communication andrelationship skills within such communities. Common models of relating include:somebody having one main or ‘primary’ partner and other ‘secondary’ ones, somebodyhaving multiple partners who they may or may not live within a triad, quad, tribe or family,and someone having multiple non-primary partners (Labriola, 2003). Polyamorous groupsmay be ‘polyfidelitous’ (with sexual contact only within the group) or open. Some feel thatpolyamory is an inherent part of their sexual identity; others claim it as a politically chosenway of relating in reaction against the norm of monogamy (Barker, 2004). Differentlanguages are emerging to describe the relationships, structures and emotions involved innon-monogamous relationships, so it is worth becoming familiar with these when workingwith openly non-monogamous clients (Ritchie & Barker, 2006).Therapeutic issues with openly non-monogamous people may include: the societal lack ofrespect and recognition of a diversity of possibility relationship structures, demands on thetime and communicative competence of those involved, difficulties arising from differentdesires and wants amongst partners, commitment issues, maintaining balance in triadic/quad/family relationships, explaining relationships to others (colleagues, family, friends),and jealousy and trust issues. People forging relationships which are different from traditional ways of relating maypresent with particular difficulties concerning their struggle to find satisfactory ways ofliving. Whilst this may offer considerable creativity and freedom for some, others may findthemselves engaged in complex living arrangements which do not necessarily meet theirneeds. Care must be taken to work with the client and their own desires in a constructiveway rather than assume that the unorthodox relationship/s is in itself problematic.Furthermore, it is important not to assume that relationship problems (such as thosementioned above) will necessarily be any greater in non-monogamous and/or non-traditional relationships than amongst traditional monogamous relationships. Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 4950 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients2.4.3 Marriages and civil partnershipsThe Civil Partnership Act (CPA) came into force in the UK on the 5 December 2005 andhas potentially affected thousands of people who are in same-sex relationships(Langdridge & Barker, 2006). The CPA gives formal recognition to same-sex couples and isthe second piece of legislation in Britain (following the Adoption and Children Act, 2002)that begins to redress the legal inequalities between opposite-sex and same-sex couples. In British culture (as in many cultures) opposite-sex interpersonal relationships are highlyvalued and are afforded an even higher financial, legal and social status once they areformally recognised through marriage (Herek, 2006). Same-sex couples on the otherhand, have not enjoyed the same level of social acceptance due to the socially stigmatisedidentity of LGB people and heterosexism in society. The legal recognition of same-sexrelationships has long been a sensitive and complex social and political issue, whereopposing views, ranging from extremist anti-gay religious groups to LGB human rightsgroups, have all been highly vocal. Some are still campaigning for full equality in terms ofmarriage whilst others are equally arguing that LGBTQ people should resist embracinginstitutions which may be deemed sexist, heterosexist and mono-normative.Exploring the decision to enter into a civil partnership, or not, can provide thepsychologist with an understanding of the meanings relevant to the client and the couple.This is in terms of the meanings of relationships, LGB rights, social recognition and status,the notion of ‘family’ and how concepts of religion and commitment might or might notfit. There are many potential therapeutic issues for people considering partnershipsincluding the involvement of families, the complexity of people living in non-monogamousrelationships, possible financial benefits, intersections with age and culture, child-rearingand the guaranteeing of security of partners.2.4.4 Partner abuseUnderstanding violence and abuse within the couple relationships of lesbians, gay men, bi and trans individuals requires an appreciation of the way in which prejudice anddiscrimination (i.e. homophobia, bi-phobia, trans-phobia and heterosexism) operate tocreate a context for isolation, rejection and disbelief, the very ingredients which increasethe risk of violence and abuse within these relationships (Ristock, 2002).Domestic violence and abuse within the relationships of sexual minorities is characterisedby conscious manipulation and control of one person by another through the use ofthreats, coercion, humiliation and/or force (Hart, 1986; Island & Letellier, 1991; Hester,Pearson & Harwin, 2000). Most definitions incorporate physical, emotional and sexualabuse and it is worth noting that in a recent UK study (Donovan et al., 2006) levels ofsexual abuse within same-sex abusive relationships were comparable to those of physicalabuse, particularly so for gay men in abusive relationships. Although, to some extent,violence and abusive behaviours within the relationships of sexual minorities mirror thoseseen in heterosexual relationships, some abusive behaviours are specific to LGBTrelationships. For instance, threats to:● reveal the sexual or gender identity of a victim to family, friends or work colleagues;● jeopardise the custody of one’s children or immigration status on grounds of sexualorientation;● reveal a partner’s HIV status, telling the victim that no-one will believe him/her giventhe level of prejudice within the agencies that exist to offer support.To date, the largest body of research on abuse and violence within same-sex relationships isthat relating to the prevalence of such abuse. However, given the level of shame and self-blame and the hidden nature of the phenomenon, Donovan et al., (2006) suggest that thisis a population who keep the abuse to themselves and as a result of this and differingthresholds and definitions of violence and abuse within the studies, findings varyenormously. For instance, Island and Letellier (1991) in their survey of violence and abusewithin gay male relationships place the rate of abuse at 15 to 20 per cent, whereas Waldner-Haugrud, Gratch and Magruder (1997) believe the figure to be as high as 29 per cent andin a comparison study conducted by Gardner (1989) rates of abuse for lesbian couples wasa high as 48 per cent and for gay male couples the figure was 38 per cent. Sigma, a Britishsurvey of gay men and lesbians (Henderson, 2003) found that one-in-four individuals insame-sex relationships experience domestic abuse, a ratio that is close to the figure forheterosexual domestic abuse against women. For trans and inter-sex people, Courvant andCook-Daniels (2000) found that 50 per cent of the respondents in their study had beenraped or assaulted by an intimate partner. There is currently a paucity of data relating tobisexual intimate partner abuse since bisexuals tend to be subsumed under lesbian and gaycouple relationships.As with all abusive relationships, one of the main challenges facing those in the helpingprofessions is that of intervening in a safe and effective manner. Unlike heterosexualrelationships, where a gender exclusive framework has been invaluable in supportingfemale victims at the hands of male abusers, in same-sex relationships power dynamics,such as financial advantage, physical size, status defined by employment and gender, playout differently since gender is a constant. Ristock and Timbang (2005) suggest that thepower dynamics may seem confusing, because same gendered partners might be the samesize and strength, and therefore physical appearance cannot be used to determine who inthe partnership, is actually the abuser. Furthermore, victims report using physical violencein self defence and/or even retaliating (Ristock, 2002; Marrujo & Kreger, 1996) and thiscan add a further layer of confusion. For that reason, the level of risk needs to be carefullyassessed to ensure that victims get the protection they need and that perpetrators in turnare encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and referred to appropriateperpetrator programmes, assuming they do want help.When it comes to seeking help, only 22 per cent of the subjects of the British study onsame-sex partner abuse (Donovan et al., 2006) sought help from anyone and of those whodid, the majority used informal networks of friends or private means, rather than turningto voluntary or statutory agencies. It seems that victims of abuse within same-sexrelationships are more likely to turn to individual counsellors, which, by its very nature, canunwittingly play into the dynamic of pathologising the victim, especially if the victimbelieves him or herself to be the cause of the abuse. Practitioners must, therefore, carefullyposition themselves and be mindful of the fact that many victims will be reluctant to namethe abuse and it may be the case that counsellors are primarily working with the symptomsand impact of the abuse, i.e. depression, low self-esteem, and fear, rather than the abuseitself. A central challenge facing professionals is that of reaching perpetrators and helpingthem face up to the consequences of their actions, with a view to offering some effectiveinput. Couple work is only indicated once the nature and extent of the abuse is clear, thevictim is safe and the perpetrator has taken responsibility for his or her actions and isPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 51motivated to change, otherwise the couple sessions may place the victim in further dangerof abuse and violence.As with all intimate partner abuse, a co-ordinated approach is recommended. To that endthe LGBT Domestic Violence Forum has been established to pool information and to co-ordinate initiatives on behalf of a population who, historically, have not been well servedby helping agencies that were established to tackle abuse of women by men. Russo (2001)suggests that the ethical challenges of developing appropriate responses to LGBTrelationship violence is to think through a framework of intersectionality (one thatconsiders the connection of relationship violence to all systems of oppression) and to keepthis work rooted in larger anti-oppressive and social justice efforts.2.5 Sociocultural diversityThe United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) describesculture as being the ‘set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotionalfeatures of society or a social group’, and encompasses ‘art and literature, lifestyles, ways ofliving together, value systems, traditions and beliefs’ (UNESCO, 2002). Within society thereare majority and minority groups, with the majority groups setting the (dominant) ‘norms’,which minority groups deviate from. Metaminorities are minorities within minorities, whowith ‘dual-minority’ or ‘multiple-minority’ statuses, separately or synergistically, arerestricted access into dominant groups and their discourse. For example, Black andMinority Ethnic (BME) people who are also sexual minorities are metaminorities ofethnicity and sexuality. As an applied psychologist you will be different and similar to yourclient on a number of different dimensions (as discussed below). You need to be aware ofthese similarities and differences and how they may influence your work. For instance, if you are a monogamous heterosexual, you should not make assumptions aboutmonogamy, or about the labels people use to describe their sexuality, sexual practices, or sexual partners.There are some overarching issues about being a minority within a minority that cut acrossthe separate socio-cultural differences listed below. These include feelings of isolation,feeling ‘aberrant’, experiencing low mood, cognitive dissonance, and anxiety. These issuesare discussed in more detail below and in the rest of this document. In addition, a numberof these socio-cultural variables described may apply to the same individual (e.g. an Asianlesbian with a disability), and these differences sometimes have interactive effects. It is,therefore, important for the clinician to keep these various dimensions in mind and let theclient privilege one above the others depending on their opinion as to which is morerelevant at any one time.2.5.1 Gender and sexualityAn individual’s gender will influence the meeting places they frequent, their socio-culturalnorms and their sexual practices. In general, lesbians have traditionally had less visibilitythat gay men, both in mainstream (predominately heterosexual) media and the genericgay press. Because of this, ‘lesbian visibility’ has been important for sexual minority womento make public their sexuality, with practices such as cutting hair short and not wearingmake-up (Clarke & Turner, 2007). These images of more ‘butch’ lesbians have become lessimportant since the early 1990s, when ‘lesbian chic’ or ‘lipstick lesbians’ brought the imageof lesbians into the public eye in a more mainstream feminine way. Today the appearance52 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients(or ‘performance’) of lesbians varies enormously from the butch/femme dichotomies ofthe 1950s.While many meeting places are for both men and women from sexual minorities, there area significant amount of same-gender functions, events, and venues. These serve animportant function in social and sexual networking, and developing and campaigning forcommon causes. Such events range from the lesbian separatism meetings of the 1980s(where women denounced all relationships with men) to the predominance of men-onlysex clubs and saunas in large British cities today.When trans people change their gender this can also change their sexuality label, and thatof their sexual or relationship partner or partners, which may or may not be acceptable tothe partner(s). This is discussed in more detail in the section on Trans issues.2.5.2 Ethnicity/raceHomosexual practices are found in many cultures/geographical regions historically andcontemporaneously (e.g. ‘motsoalle’ relationships between women in Lesotho, ‘two-spirit’individuals in Native North America, ‘kathoey’ of Thailand, ‘köçeks’ and ‘bacchás’ ofCentral Asia, etc.). A distinction should be made between sexual acts and sexual identities.Individuals may not always ascribe a particular sexual identity to their sexual practices oracts, therefore terms such as gay, bisexual, lesbian, etc. must be used with caution. Thereare varieties of sexual identities and sexual identity labels based on language, ethnicity,race, religion, culture, and socio-economic status (e.g. panthi, kothi, Down-Low/DL, gay-for-pay, etc.). ‘Coming out’ as belonging to an identity-affirming sexual minority may not always be anoption, or even desirable, for some BME people; and does not always lead to positiveexperiences in this group (Chan, 1987; Nair, 2006; Nair, in press). Therefore, while it isimportant for the psychologist to explore the client’s beliefs and expectations of ‘comingout’, it should not be considered as a vital milestone in the development of the client’ssexuality. There may be issues of visibility and invisibility for some BME sexual minority people. Theymay fear being exposed or ‘out-ed’ if they access mainstream LGBTQ venues. Others mayexperience alienation due to a lack of visibility of non-White people represented inmainstream LGBTQ press and other media and/or LGBTQ venues, as well as overt racism inthese contexts. Such exclusion could lead to confusion and distress, no sense of belonging,and poor social support/networks with other sexual minority people, who could be apotential support against homophobia. An attempt to integrate with dominant LGBTQcommunities may lead to internalised racism in BME sexual minorities (Chuang, 1999). Thisinternalised racism may further alienate the client from his/her own ethnic communities,which would normally provide solidarity and protection from wider societal racism. Peoplefrom sexual and ethnic minorities, therefore, face the potential for double discrimination onthe basis of racism and homophobia from the societies they are affiliated with. External and internalised homophobia among BME sexual minorities, and the widereffects of racism, may lead to stronger ties with their own ethnic groups, which mainlypromote reproductive heteronormativity and condemn other aspects of sexuality.Heterosexual marriage and reproduction are rites of passage in some such cultures, andhold high socio-cultural significance, placing sexual minorities under immense pressure toPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 53conform to these standards. There may also be stringent gender-roles and mores, andthese are linked to promoting compulsory heterosexuality and discouraging/chastising allother sexualities. People may find themselves agreeing to traditional marriages and living a secret (‘closeted’) life to express their preferred or alternative sexual identities.Both ethnic and sexual minorities report having negative experiences accessing mentalhealth services (King et al., 2003). Therefore, particular care must be taken to ensure thattheir (negative) expectations of psychologists are not confirmed. Understanding clients’previous experiences accessing mental health and/or psychological services is importantwhen establishing rapport at the start of working together.Some BME groups may be erotised by the dominant culture, reflecting colonial forms ofracism that were prevalent in the slave trade and can still be evidenced today (e.g. thecolonial and postcolonial stereotyping of black men having a voracious (animalistic) sexualappetite and prowess, and black women as being licentious).2.5.3 Migrants, refugees and asylum seekersIn countries around the world, people from sexual minorities are criminalised, tortured orill-treated because of their sexuality (see Amnesty International Campaigns atwww.amnesty.org.uk/). Migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers may experience difficultiesin being a visible sexual minority for fear of rejection (from members of their owndiasporic communities), and fear of persecution from the State because of their sexuality,based on previous negative experiences from their home countries. However, beinginvisible reduces the possibility of meeting other sexual minority people, and being seenwith visible sexual minorities may jeopardise their own invisibility. This conflict betweenbeing visible and invisible can be problematic. It requires the clinician to spend timedeveloping rapport and trust, being culturally sensitive to the meaning of the client’ssexuality in their sociocultural context and developing a language to discuss these issues ina meaningful way in therapy.Migrants, refugees, and asylum seeker clients who are also in sexual minorities may findadjusting to local sexual scripts, codes and practices difficult, and may find mainstreamsexual identity labels imposed on them. Alternatively, they may feel pressured to assimilate54 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsCase Study: Andrew, a British-Asian man, married a woman his parents ‘chose’ for him,which permitted him to come to England. He has always been attracted to men andenjoys sexual contact with them. He identifies as being heterosexual, and rejects anynotion of being ‘gay’. He repeatedly experienced erectile dysfunction while attemptingto have sex with his wife, which led her to ask for a separation. He wants to get marriedagain and to have children. He also attests that he wants to continue having sex withother men, but doesn’t feel the need to disclose this information to anybody else (fromNair, in press). Comment: Andrew’s refusal to accept the notion of being ‘gay’ is important, andhighlights how culturally loaded such a term is. Here, the therapist would benefit fromunderstanding what ‘gay’ means to Andrew, and how he can negotiate his sexualchoices without identifying as a sexual minority. with dominant sexual minority groups to gain acceptance, the values of which may be atodds with those of the client (e.g. Muslim sexual minorities having issues accessing ‘the scene’ where alcohol is served). Further complications and misunderstanding canoccur as a result of language barriers and difficulties.Limited financial resources may preclude some migrants, refugees, and asylum seekersfrom being able to access certain LGBTQ spaces and events, preventing them fromintegrating with other sexual minorities. Poor availability of the internet which can beaccessed in private, because of lack of funds, may further hamper possibilities of meetingother ‘out’ or invisible (‘straight acting’ or ‘discreet’) sexual minorities. The internet iswell used by sexual minority communities to find sexual and romantic partners, as well asto forge links with others.Refugees and asylum seekers may also find it difficult to access health services (e.g. Genito-Urinary Medicine clinics, Mental Health services, etc.) due to language barriers, lack ofinformation and knowledge about health conditions and available services, and poortargeting of such groups by health services. This places such individuals at higher risk ofmental health problems, and/or contracting and/or infecting others with sexuallytransmitted infections. Immigrants may lack knowledge or accurate information abouthealth problems, or not perceive themselves to be at risk (e.g. Chinouya, Davidson &Fenton, 2000). Furthermore, this group may not have adequate resources to treat ormanage health conditions, or to access psychological help. In addition, new refugees andasylum seekers may have difficulty distinguishing between the Home Office and the NHS,both being government agencies, and so have fears about confidentiality.2.5.4 Urban/rural issuesLiving in a small community can make it difficult to ‘come out’ or transition gender, asanonymity may be impossible and such changes may be met with hostility and lack ofacceptance. Similarly, same-sex partners living together or moving into the area may beconcerned about ‘coming out’ and being accepted in the new community. In addition,access to supportive communities or places to socialise and meet friends and partnersmight be limited in rural settings. Some people may move to urban areas due to thePsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 55Case Study: Musa, a young Muslim asylum seeker, fled from his country after beingattacked for having had sex with a statesman there. Living in Britain now, he findshimself unable to connect with gay men. He feels shunned by other black gay menbecause he doesn’t speak English well and cannot afford to dress ‘trendy’, and feelsthat only white men who are older than his father are sexually interested in him – thismakes him uncomfortable. He is also scared to disclose his sexuality to (heterosexual)people from his homeland, as he fears being cut off from them and the mosque – hisonly friends and community here. Comment: Musa’s predicament is not uncommon. He faces prejudice based on hismultiple-minority statuses. This highlights how an individual’s identities can be in theforeground or background, depending on circumstances. The therapist’s challengehere is to help the client understand and negotiate his/her various identities, tofacilitate coexistence with minimal dissonance.problems associated with being a sexual minority in a rural area. Rural-urban drift bringswith it associated difficulties (e.g. employment issues, housing, financial difficulties, etc.).However, there are also advantages to such moves as most of the services for sexualminorities are based in large cities. Information about these services is usually availablefrom local LGBTQ helplines. 2.5.5 Religion/faith/spiritual communitiesDominant interpretations of most religions admonish same-sex practices, but liberalinterpretations generally only reprove coercive sexualities. However, strong feelings of guiltand shame may be experienced by both believers/religion-practising individuals and forothers, for example, parents or siblings, for whom religion and culture exist as one entityand are a way of life. Therefore, rejection and acceptance by significant others may beimportant factors in the client’s decision to ‘come out’.People may find it difficult to negotiate sexuality with religious and cultural views, causingcognitive dissonance and distress (de Jong & Jivraj, 2002). Religious views may deter sexualminorities from accessing mainstream LGBTQ social venues, which predominantly tend tobe clubs and bars (e.g. venues with a ‘backroom’ where anonymous sex takes place). This ismore of a problem in smaller cities, where alternative meeting places are not alwaysavailable, such as LGBTQ-friendly cafes.Fortunately, many LGB faith groups exist as a resource: ● Jewish [www.jglg.org.uk] ● Muslim [www.imann.org.uk] ● Muslim women [www.safraproject.org] ● Christian [www.lgcm.org.uk] ● Catholic [www.questgaycatholic.org.uk] ● Buddhist [ www.sgi-uk.org ]. 2.5.6 AgeThere is a premium placed on youth in dominant LGBTQ cultures and social spaces. Thismakes it more difficult for older lesbian and gay people to meet friends or partners,particularly if they came out later in life (perhaps after having been married and/or havingchildren) and so do not have an LGBTQ social network. Older individuals may faceisolation and exclusion, leading to experiences of loneliness, with loss of friends andpartner(s), particularly in the absence of familial or other traditional support systems. In addition, some older adults have lived in a time when their sexuality was considered acriminal offence (until 1967 in England, 1980 in Scotland, and 1982 in Northern Ireland)and a mental illness (until 1973). This may have had a detrimental impact on theirformation of a sexual identity or have led to homophobic abuse (sometimes at the handsof mental or physical health professionals). This could have an impact on their trust in youas a psychologist and the service you work for. Older sexual minorities living in nursinghomes have concerns about their being accepted by staff and other residents. There areorganisations that work for better services for older sexual minorities, for example:● Polari [www.polari.org]● Age Concern’s Opening Doors programmewww.ageconcern.org.uk/AgeConcern/openingdoors.asp]● Alzheimer’s Society LGBT Carers [www.alzheimers.org.uk/Gay_carers/index.htm].56 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients‘Coming out’ (models of which include Cass (1979), D’Augelli (1991), and Rivers (1997))can happen at any age. It is a process that repeats itself in every new environment or withnew people, and might be particularly pertinent in adolescence where there is peer pressureon opposite-sex sexual experiences and relationships. For those living with parents, comingout to them might be problematic, particularly if the young LGBTQ individuals aredependents. There are organisations that work with young sexual minorities, for example,Alfred Kennedy Trust [www.akt.org.uk], gay youth UK [www.gayyouth.org.uk]. It should beremembered that while the age of consent for sex between men has been equal toheterosexuals (16 years in Great Britain, 17 years in Northern Ireland) since 2000 (SexualOffences (Amendment) Act, 2000 (Office of Public Sector Information, 2000), Alladolescents can be offered confidential sexual health services between 13 and 16 years, if assessed to be mature as rated by Fraser Guidelines and Gillick Competence in Englandand Wales (Department of Health, 2001), and the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act,1991 (C50) in Scotland (Office of Public Sector Information, 1991).Parenting issues in mid-life can be relevant for LGBTQ individuals, trying to find a donor,facing prejudice from family, friends, medical professionals, or even uncoveringinternalised homophobia within the relationship. Finding a psychologist to work with theseissues can also be a challenge, because of the strength of the assumptions of what a ‘family’consists of being based on heterosexist models.2.5.7 ClassClass can affect one’s sense of confidence and eloquence to speak about one’s sexualityand expect to be accepted. For those from lower class/socio-economic communities, accessto mainstream venues might be a problem, for example, Pride events, commercial LGBTQspaces and venues, private counselling, etc., and they are less likely to engage incommunitarian gay activities (Keogh, Dodds & Henderson, 2004). However, for someworking-class sexual minorities, financial autonomy may have resulted from having leftschool/college early to seek employment, which may create inroads to such spaces. Lack ofaccess to mainstream events and lack of opportunities to move to more gay-friendly areasmay result in isolation, hostility from heterosexual counterparts, or pressure to conform todominant forms/expressions of masculinity/femininity (e.g. ‘gansta’ machismo).Homophobic bullying is rife is British schools (Rivers & D’Augelli, 2001), and childrenfrom working-class backgrounds are often left to deal with the situation themselves withoutthe help of parents or school (Keogh et al., 2004; Henderson, 2004). Even after leavingschool, working-class gay men face more discrimination at work and from public andcommercial services, compared to gay men from other classes (ibid.).People may be eroticised for their class identity within sexual minority communities (e.g. ‘Chav Boi’, ‘hoodie lad’, ‘trackie boy’, etc.). Interestingly, in places with few LGBTQ-specific venues, class barriers may not be an issue, as people are brought together byhaving their sexuality in common. The association between working-class (lower socio-economic status) and limited access tohealth care has been repeatedly documented from the time of the Black Report(Department of Health and Social Security, 1980) and continue to be acknowledged inrecent times (e.g. Cattell, 2001; Scambler & Higgs, 2001). Finding access to a psychologistmay, therefore, be problematic.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 572.5.8 (Dis)abilitiesLGBTQ communities can be body fascistic in the extreme (with the dominance of onebody type that is considered attractive, for example, men in the gay press tend to be verymuscular). The importance of appearance associated with physique and style in dominantLGBTQ cultures may make connecting with able-bodied counterparts arduous andproblematic for people with physical disabilities. Thus, making friends and partners if anLGBTQ person has a physical or learning disability can pose a challenge. Sexual minorities with learning disabilities are less likely to have their needs recognisedbecause of social and practice disincentives (Cambridge, 1997). There is also evidence tosuggest that this metaminority also faces high HIV-related risks (Cambridge, 1994, 1996).Sexual minorities with learning disabilities may also not take on the labels of lesbian, gay,or bisexual, as these may be associated with discriminated groups. Adopting such labels inaddition to the label of learning disabled increases the likelihood of double-discrimination.As most sexual minority social or commercial meeting spaces (apart from virtual spaces)tend to be clubs and nightclubs, access could be a limitation for people with disabilities.This might have improved with new legislation, such as the Disability Discrimination Act(Office of Public Sector Information, 2005), but it is still a problem, particularly for peoplewith mobility restrictions. This is more of a problem in smaller cities, where alternativemeeting places are not always available. There are some LGB disability specialist groups,such as those for people who are deaf, but by and large the LGBT social networks aregeared for able-bodied people. Clients may find it beneficial joining organisations whichsupport LGBTQ people with disabilities, such as Regard [www.regard.org.uk].2.6 Health2.6.1 Physical HealthLesbian health can easily be sidelined as most literature (particularly sexual healthliterature) is aimed at gay men. There are also fewer specialised resources available tolesbians (e.g. lesbian sexual health clinics). However, there are a number of health issuesthat are highly relevant to lesbian and bisexual women, including high risk of breast,cervical, and ovarian cancer (Carroll, 1999; Bailey et al., 2000), and obesity (Boehmer,Bowen & Bauer, 2007). However, many lesbians do not visit a gynaecologist, viewing themas only relevant in cases of contraception and motherhood (ILGA, 2006). In mainstreamhealth services, lesbians, gay men and bisexuals may face prejudice and discriminationfrom medical staff. A lack of acceptance and knowledge of sexual minority lives and queersexual practices in health settings have been well documented (e.g. McFarlane, 1998).Health professionals often assume heterosexuality, as well as overtly or covertlydiscriminating against sexual minority patients.High rates of STIs are prevalent in sexual minority communities, particularly in gay malecommunities; with gonorrhoea having increased by 10 per cent between 2004–2005,syphilis by 66 per cent between 2001–2005, and herpes by eight per cent between2004–2005 (Health Protection Agency, 2007). However, as with other health conditions,the focus in sexual health has been on gay men and so lesbian sexual health and HIVissues are under-researched and under-resourced.58 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients2.6.2 HIVThere are high rates of newly acquired HIV infection among gay and bisexual men or menwho have sex with men (MSM) in general, when compared to heterosexual counterparts(although there have been more heterosexual people diagnosed with HIV in the UK since1999 (Health Protection Agency, 2007)). Being HIV positive can be an identity, as well asinfluencing sexual practices and forming new identities, such as ‘barebacking’. Knowledgeof Highly Active Anti-retroviral Treatment (HAART) and Post-Exposure Prophylactic (PEP)in gay communities can be well developed and expert patients are common. Lipodystrohy,a side-effect of anti-retroviral treatment, which redistributes lipids and changes body shapein characteristic ways, can be a prime concern for HIV positive gay and bisexual men onmedication, as it can potentially disclose their HIV status. Outside of sexual minoritycommunities, gay and bisexual men can be blamed for spreading disease, which can be afurther cause of distress and/or abuse.2.6.3 Mental HealthHigh rates of mental health concerns have been reported in LGBT populations (e.g. Kinget al., 2003a, 2003b). Some of these problems are related to homophobia andheterosexism from the wider society and from further prejudice and discrimination in theNHS (e.g. McFarlane, 1998). Frequently reported problems include: depression, anxiety,substance misuse, and eating disorders. There are also high rates (when compared toheterosexual counterparts) of deliberate self-harm, suicide attempts and completedsuicides, particularly in youth (Rivers, 1997). However, there is some evidence to suggestthat there may be over/under-diagnosis of conditions; this has been argued in particularfor Borderline Personality Disorder (Hagger-Johnson, 2007). Clinicians should also bewary of considering a diagnosis of ‘Sex addiction’ in sexual minorities, simply on the basisof any predefined ‘norm’, as this can vary with individual or group sexual identities andpractices.2.6.4 Substance use There are higher rates of drug and alcohol use in lesbian, gay, and bisexual communitiesthan in the general population (Hughes & Eliason, 2002), including the use of steroidsand recreational drugs. This has been suggested to be linked to comorbid conditions orpoor socio-cultural support against heterosexism and homophobia. However, it could alsobe attributed to the focus of the major socialising avenues open to sexual minorities, whichare connected to drinking and recreational drug use (i.e. bars and clubs). The use ofanabolic steroids has also been linked to the desire for the ideal mesomorphic body image,and also associated with ‘muscle dysmorphia’ (Pope, Phillips & d’Olivardia, 2000). 2.7 Children, young people, families and schools2.7.1 Sexual Development and Sexual Identity DevelopmentDespite the recognition that sexual desires and attractions form an essential part ofadolescent sexuality, very little attention is given to their origin or presence duringchildhood. It has been suggested that cultural norms maintain a silence around this topic(Savin-Williams, 2005). Research on the development of sexual attraction (e.g. Remafedi,Farrow & Deisher, 1992) suggests that young children can recognise attractions, but self-identity labels do not become consolidated until adolescence. However, young LGB peopleoften describe feeling ‘different’ from an early age but are unable to clearly label thisdifference (Flowers & Buston, 2001; Bell, Weinberg & Hammersmith,1981). Maguen et al.,Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 59(2002) found that the mean ages in their survey for first awareness of same-sex attractionwas 11 years, with 16 years for first same-sex sexual contact, and 17 years for first disclosureof sexual identity. Issues of identity and sense of self and self-esteem are relevant for adolescents in the widestsense (Erikson 1959, 1964, 1967) as they explore their relationships to develop a sense ofwho they are, how they can feel good about that, and the kind of future they would like.Erikson states that the unique developmental task of adolescence is to solidify a personalidentity. Sexual behaviour has been described as one of the key ways, in contemporarysociety at least, for adolescents to ‘de-satellise’ and begin, emotionally and physically, toleave the parental orbit and move toward independence (Selverstone, 1989). This processis challenging enough especially in a media focussed society which portrays very negativeimages of youth, and indeed, the future of society. Adding the developing sense of oneselfas LGB can add considerably to the stress of this process. All adolescents share the samephysical, cognitive, psychological, and social tasks of development, regardless of sexualidentity. However, if one of the primary psychological tasks of adolescence is thedevelopment and consolidation of identity, then LGB adolescents face many challengesthat heterosexual adolescents do not (Fontaine & Hammond,1996). 2.7.2 Identity and coming out for LGB YouthAn individual’s sexual identity as part of their overall identity is clarified and consolidatedthrough several processes; cohort comparisons, societal confirmation, and peer affirmation(Fontaine & Hammond, 1996). The systems around adolescents (families, schools,neighbourhoods, work places etc.) provide the contexts for these processes but for LGBadolescents they often, at best, fail to foster these positive processes. More often, however,the situation is harsher in that they provide negative and stigmatising contexts for sexualidentity formation. Therefore, many LGB adolescents develop a sexual minority identity in spite of the fact that the systems they live within promote the heterosexual norm.Of course, for many, the process of developing a LGB identity is completed afteradolescence. For others the questioning of sexual identity will never result in a LGBidentity, even though some may continue to engage in same-sex behaviour (Savin-Williams,2005). This brings into question the limitations of common usage sexual identities, as theselabels can be too reductionist to capture the full extent of people’s sexuality. It is importantto remember that although transitory same-sex behaviour can cause some confusion, it isthe minority of adolescents who go on to develop LGB identities (Savin-Williams, 2005). It has been suggested that fluidity of identity is more relevant to young women than youngmen, with the majority of college-aged, same sex-attracted women shifting sexual identities,sometimes multiple times (Diamond, 2003). However, it is safe to say that adolescence isthe usual period when sexual identity formation commences. Several models of thisprocess have been offered (Cass, 1979, 1996; Lewis, 1984; Troiden, 1989). All of thesemodels describe stages moving towards an increasing level of acceptance of a LGB identity,with a progression from confusion, through exploration, to integration (Fontaine &Hammond, 1996).For example, Cass (1979, 1996) describes six stages of identity formation: confusion,comparison, tolerance, acceptance, pride, and synthesis. At the first stage, confusion isgreat as heterosexual identity is called into question and the adolescent may seek60 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsinformation on being LGB, which is a difficult task given the dearth of accessibleinformation. In the identity comparison stage, strategies may be developed to reduce theincongruence between same-gender attractions and heterosexual identity. Such strategiesmay include believing a same-gender attraction to be a one-off, believing same-genderattraction to be a phase, and considering oneself to be bisexual (which provides thepotential for heterosexual behaviour). The identity tolerance stage means a move furtherfrom a heterosexual identity and towards a LGB one. This can often include seeking outthe company of LGB people to alleviate a sense of isolation. Identity acceptance suggeststhe development of a stronger LGB identity and increasing contact with LGB people.Accessing the company of other LGB youth can be extremely difficult however, especiallyfor those living in more rural areas. The identity pride stage often results in strongidentification with LGB culture and a devaluing of heterosexuality. This gives way to lesspolarising views in the final stage of identity synthesis when a realisation and acceptance ofthe similarities between LGB culture and heterosexual culture can be accommodatedthrough more inclusive behaviour.As is usual with psychological stage models, the stage theories of LGB identity formationhave attracted considerable criticism. These stages are considered to be clear and obvious,representing a universal, linear process that does not necessarily fit with reality because ofthe diversity of LGB populations (Savin-Williams, 2005). Troiden’s (1989) model, whichdescribes the four stages of sensitisation, identity confusion, identity assumption, andidentity commitment, is perhaps more realistic in being more spiral than linear, suggestingthat individuals move back and forth between stages and that not all will experience allstages or substages (Savin-Williams, 2005). It is recognised that development is moderatedby external factors (such as heterocentrism and prejudice) and internal factors (such asinternalised homophobia and personal strengths). Savin-Williams (2005) also stresses thatthe stage models are ethnocentric, and he suggests that in ethnic minority communities,sexual identity can be strategic and situational, being negotiated and renegotiated. Thestage models have also been described as a developmental psychology of the rememberedpast which fails to recognise that recollection may be affected by subsequent life events.For example, the experience of being different as a child may be an adult interpretation ofearlier life experiences. Little is known about how LGB youth experience their lives as theyare living them (Moore & Rosenthal, 1993).2.7.3 The process of coming outFor most, coming out is an ongoing process and not a one-off event. LGB people return toexplaining their sexual identity to others throughout their lives as heterosexuality is sooften assumed. The early coming out events to family and friends can be the most stressfulhowever, and are among the most stressful LGB related life events described by LGB youth(D’Augelli, 1991; Rotheram-Borus et al., 1995). Survey results (Fox, 1995; Savin-Williams,1998) are suggesting that the ages of disclosure of sexual identity are becoming younger,indicating that LGB youth are progressing through the process of sexual identitydevelopment at a younger age. Reasons proposed for this include increasing numbers ofadults identifying as LGB and hence an increase in positive role models, increased mediaattention, growing cultural acceptance, and growing opportunities for socialising withother LGB youth (Boxer, Cook & Herdt, 1991). Ryan (2001) suggests that, until relativelyrecently, most LGB youth ‘came-out’ in their late teens or early 20s when they were eitherPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 61working or attending college or university, rather than when they were at secondary school(see also Clarke & Broughton, 2005). More young people are ‘coming-out’ whilst atsecondary school, and, with few exceptions (for example, the charities Family and Friendsof Lesbian and Gay Men, in the UK, and Parents, Friends and Family of Lesbians and Gays,in North America), school and community support services have not kept pace with thisapparent cultural change.Not all LGB youth do come out of course (some never) and learn to live a life of dualidentities; one public and one private. Even for young people, the hiding of sexual identitycan cause insecurity, social withdrawal, and demoralisation (Hetrick & Martin, 1987).2.7.4 Risks of coming outThe disclosure of sexual identity is a stressful event for most LGB youth because of the fear,often justified, of negative reactions from those they disclose to. For many young people, a fear of rejection by parents appears to be well founded. A British survey of LGB youth inLondon (Trenchard & Warren, 1984) revealed that approximately 40 per cent of parentsreacted negatively to a child’s disclosure of LGB identity, with the most extremeconsequence being that some young people left home (11 per cent). Another commonparental response was to send their son or daughter to a doctor (10 per cent) or to apsychiatrist (15 per cent). In Wallace and Monsen’s 2004 study, (Personalcommunications) conducted in London, they found that, in comparison to 1984, moreyoung people were being rejected by family members when they came out (32 per cent)and more were being thrown out of home (27 per cent of those who disclosed toparents/carers were thrown out). Of those young people who reported experiencingviolence from family members as a result of their sexual orientation, over half still livedwith the violent family member(s). Finally, 23 per cent of the 2004 sample were ‘out’ totheir doctor, five per cent had attended a psychiatric unit and a further 42 per centreported that they had received a clinical diagnosis from medical staff focused aroundanxiety disorders and depression. Rejection by parents can have a particularly strongimpact because the maintenance of parent-adolescent bonds facilitates the achievement ofdevelopmental tasks for adolescents (Savin-Williams, 1989). The importance of coming outto parents in particular, despite the stress experienced, is indicated by the high percentageof LGB youth who succeed in the task. In a North American sample of LGB youth, 81 percent had disclosed to at least one family member (D’Augelli & Hershberger, 1993).As well as experiencing rejection from their families, many LGB youth receive direct abusefrom prejudiced and intolerant peers (Rivers & Carragher, 2003; Rivers & D’Augelli, 2001;Rivers, 2003; Reid, Monsen & Rivers, 2004). There is particular pressure to conform tocertain sex-role stereotypes in adolescence. Gonsiorek (1988) observed that failure toconform could result in cruel behaviour from peers. Savin-Williams (1995b) found thatadolescents (particularly boys and young men) are frequently intolerant of difference inothers and may actively punish and ostracise peers, particularly if the perceived differenceconcerns their sexuality (Gough, 2002; Phoenix, Frosh & Pattman, 2003). In Trenchard and Warren’s (1984) survey, 58 per cent of respondents reported verbalabuse and 21 per cent reported some kind of experience of physical assault. In a surveyconducted by the LGB political lobbying group Stonewall (Mason & Palmer, 1996), 48 percent of respondents aged under 18 had experienced violence and 90 per cent name-calling62 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsbecause of their sexuality. Of the violent attacks reported, 50 per cent involved fellowstudents and 40 per cent took place within school. In Wallace and Monsen’s (2004,Personal communications) study, about 66 per cent of respondents indicated that they hadexperienced bullying at school because of their sexual orientation. Ellis and High (2004)found similar patterns in their partial replication of Trenchard and Warren’s (1984) survey.About 31 per cent of respondents indicated teasing, 37 per cent had been verbally abusedand 15 per cent had been physically assaulted. These figures confirm that the fear ofviolence, intimidation and rejection reported by many LGB youth is indeed justified(Bontempo & D’Augelli, 2002; Garofalo et al., 1998).2.7.5 Sexual identity and ethnicity, culture and religionYoung people born within ethnic minority families often face the task of synchronisingcultural and religious identities from the country of the family’s origin with dominantcultural identities relating to the country of residence. For ethnic minority LGB youth thisprocess can be further complicated by having to co-ordinate minority sexual identities thatcan be in opposition to cultural and religious beliefs. This has been described as facingidentity barriers on many fronts simultaneously (Fontaine & Hammond, 1996). Researchin this area is sorely lacking, however (Maguen et al., 2002), especially in the UK. In NorthAmerica, Dubé and Savin-Williams (1999) and Loiacano (1989) suggested that AfricanAmericans may be less likely to come out to others for fear of disconnection from networksthat support ethnic identity. The importance of social networks that support thedevelopment of LGB identities has been highlighted here. The task of finding networksthat support numerous minority identities can be a difficult one. On the other hand, somestudies have failed to detect ethnic group differences in coming-out processes (e.g.Newman & Muzzonigro, 1993). 2.7.6 Vulnerability of LGB youthThe discrimination, rejection and victimisation that young LGB people frequently face canhave a major impact on their mental health. Most of the studies of LGB youth in the UKhave been small-scale but a consistent picture emerges from them of LGB youth facingparticular risks to their mental, emotional and physical health, safety and well-being(PACE, 2004). LGB youth are vulnerable to low self-esteem, self-harm, suicide, anddepression. A review of international research found that LGB youth were two to threetimes more likely to attempt suicide than other young people and probably account foraround 30 per cent of all completed suicides of young people, which is of coursedisproportionately high (Warwick, Aggleton & Douglas, 2000). Young lesbians in the UKmay be especially vulnerable regarding these mental health issues, including alcohol anddrug abuse (Bridget & Lucille, 1996). Indeed, higher prevalence rates for alcohol andsubstance misuse have been described in LGB youth populations (The Metro Centre,2005), as they have been for adult LGB populations in the UK. Several factors have beenassociated with this higher prevalence (PACE, 2004). A pressure to use alcohol and drugsremains in youth culture generally of course. Many LGB youth begin to participate in thelesbian and gay ‘scene’ which often accounts for higher levels of using alcohol and drugs.Many LGB youth use alcohol and drugs as a way of coping with their developing sexualidentities and the stressors that come with that.High rates of engaging in other ‘risky’ behaviours, such as unsafe sexual contact have beendescribed by LGB youth in London (The Metro Centre, 2005). There may be manyPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 63reasons for this. For instance, it has been suggested that LGB youth who find it difficult toaccess social networks which support their sexual identity may seek out social contact insituations that involve sexual or personal risk. The need for the provision of LGB-sensitivesexual health information has been highlighted accordingly (Blake, Ledsky, Lehman,Goodenow, Sawyer & Hack, 2001).Homelessness and running awayAs described above, LGB youth have increased vulnerability for homelessness. In a recentsurvey in London (The Metro Centre, 2005), one in five young LGB respondents had beenhomeless with half of these homeless at age 16 or younger and half have been madehomeless solely due to their sexual identity. This does not include those who were thrownout of their parent’s home. A quarter of respondents who disclosed their sexuality toparents whilst living at home were forced to leave. Of respondents who reported feelingunsafe at home three quarters still lived with parents (and siblings).Internalised HomophobiaLGB youth are vulnerable to developing negative attitudes about themselves and otherLGB people because of exposure to and internalising homophobia (PACE, 2004). In oneresearch study 10 per cent of young gay men describe realising they were gay as the firstnegative experience they could remember, and for a number of them their feelings werestill very negative about this (Warwick et al., 2001). Positive LGB role models may help todiminish this problem, but although increasing, their numbers remain minimal.2.7.7 Resilience of LGB youthWhilst recognising and stressing the vulnerability of LGB youth, recent thinking andresearch has brought into question the victimised and pathologised positions that are oftenascribed to LGB youth (Talburt, Rofes & Rasmussen, 2004; Youdell, 2004). This work hasasked whether, and under what conditions, a positive non-heterosexual experience of lifemight be possible and has actively fought against perpetuating a narrative of LGB youththat frames them as victims in need of tolerance and understanding (D’Emilio, 2002;Youdell, 2004). ‘Unencumbered with this knowledge about how they are supposed to feel,act, and believe, millions of teens with same-sex attractions continue to live their daily lifewith as much happiness and angst as any other teenager’ (Savin-Williams, 2005). It isdifficult to imagine practitioners (let alone the public) holding an image of LGB youth asvital, empowered, strong and sexual. Such an image is very difficult to accommodate formany schools, parents/carers and support workers. The focus has been on the image ofLGB youth as ‘victims’ of prejudice and bullying, ‘at risk’ of HIV/AIDS, substance abuse,alcoholism, depression and suicide, homelessness, violence, dropping out of school andfailing to reach their potential (D’Augelli & Patterson, 2001; Fikar, 1992; Garofalo et al.,1998; Savin-Williams, 1995a; Savin-Williams & Cohen, 1996). However, it is important toremember that those coming to the attention of psychologists in educational settings andchild and adolescent mental health services are usually those who are indeed vulnerable.2.8 Psychological interventions2.8.1 Individual interventionsSchneider (1998) provides a useful framework for thinking through the issues associatedwith managing the needs of LGB youth at an individual level. First, young people may seekassistance to obtain support for issues (such as confusion, isolation and distress) directly64 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsrelated to their developing sexual identity. These young people require connection withother young people like themselves so they can construct a positive identity. Second,adolescents may present with general issues that are related to and exacerbated by fearsand tensions surrounding their developing sexual identity (such as family and relationshipproblems). Applied psychologists need to facilitate the management of the immediatedilemma, in the broader context of distress associated with possible undisclosed sexualidentity. Third, young people may present with issues unrelated to their sexual identity.LGB Youth may well be referred to child and adolescent mental health services for any ofthe above reasons. However, adolescents will more likely not ask directly for psychologicalsupport or counselling. Any confusion about sexual identity may be reflected indirectly. It is also important to remember that at the time of the referral the young person may notyet have labelled their sexual identity and so the contribution of sexual identity to thepresenting problem can be unclear (Coleman & Remafedi, 1989). In the school context, it is unlikely (although not unknown) that a pupil will be referred to the school’s linkeducational psychologist as a result of concerns directly related to their sexuality. It is morelikely that LGB adolescents will be referred due to concerns regarding their behaviour,emotional well being and/or schoolwork. There is little or no information about theincidence of requests for referrals to educational psychology services for LGB adolescentsin the UK, and little in the way of specific recommendations for suitable interventions forthis age group (Comely, 1993; King & Bartlett, 1999; Radkowsky & Siegel, 1997; Smith,Bartlett & King, 2004). Psychologists’ hypotheses should allow for the possibility that sexualidentity may be an important aspect to explore with adolescents, even if not explicitlymentioned (Monsen et al., 1998; Monsen, 2001). The careful exploration of sexual identities and sexual behaviour should form part of allassessments conducted with adolescents, therefore. Many are of the opinion that it is thepsychologist’s responsibility to bring up this topic (Coleman & Remafedi, 1989).Assumptions of heterosexuality will discourage many adolescents from mentioning same-sex behaviour or feelings. It has been recognised that psychologists tread a thin linebetween not focusing too closely on sexual identity issues or pushing toward prematureresolution of identity development for fear of exacerbating adjustment difficulties, anddismissing the relevance of same-sex attractions, which could be as damaging (Coleman &Remafedi, 1989). It is easy to see therefore why many psychologists avoid exploring sexualidentities with adolescents altogether. Other adolescents may disclose their sexual identityto psychologists, in which case the psychologist must be sensitive to issues of confidentiality,especially because the young person might not have (and might have no desire to) comeout to their family, school staff or their peers. When working with LGB young people, as well as using generic psychological practiceframeworks (i.e., Problem-Analysis, Monsen et al., 1998; Monsen & Frederickson, 2008;Woolfson et al., 2003), the stage models of sexual identity formation have informed thepractice of LGB focused counselling approaches, with the primary task seen to besupporting LGB youth through these stages (Fontaine & Hammond, 1996). Otherindividual approaches to psychological intervention also have an important role to playwhen supporting LGB youth. While there is no reason to believe that Cognitive BehaviourTherapy (CBT) would be less effective with LGB youth, very little has been publishedabout how to integrate issues of sexual identity into therapy with younger people. However,Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 65there are unique clinical issues that need to be incorporated into thorough caseformulations and interventions when working with LGB youth (Safren & Rodgers., 2001).For example, from a cognitive perspective, exposure to negative attitudes about same-sexattractions can promote the development of negative core beliefs about the self (Safren etal., 2001). Narrative therapies (e.g. Freedman & Combs, 1996) may be particularly helpfulin co-ordinating stories of identity with the cultural and religious stories held by thesystems that LGB youth inhabit, and these approaches can be of particular relevance to theexperiences of LGB youth from ethnic minority communities. Narrative therapies arerecognised for offering interventions that are culturally sensitive and acknowledge the roleof power and privilege in the construction of stories about what it means to be LGB inparticular societies (Saltzburg, 2007).To sum up, in terms of interventions at an individual level, evidence suggests that workingto increase feelings of self-worth is more likely to reduce self-destructive attitudes andbehaviour. Much of the work with individuals is focused on creating a safe and supportiveenvironment so that they can feel good about themselves. There is also an emphasis onfinding social groups that can enhance self-acceptance and help the young person tounderstand that the stigma they experience is not intrinsic to them, and on buildingcoping skills and resilient attitudes and behaviours (including assertion and problemsolving skills).There are limitations when working at an individual level – for instance, sexual identity isperceived as being fixed. This kind of intervention prompts (and requires) a coming outstory that leads to a declaration of lesbianism, gayness or bisexuality. A story with an endpoint is seen as more conducive to the development and maintenance of positive mentalhealth than a story that is about ‘becoming’ and never quite getting to ‘out’. Anotherlimitation is that most psychologists outside of child and adolescent mental health servicesare unlikely to have time to work closely with one pupil (and their family) over anextended period. In educational settings, most tend to work through those adults who havedaily contact with the adolescent to develop supportive groups, and provide access toinformation and services designed for LGB pupils, such as youth groups, mentoringprogrammes and help-lines (Crowley et al., 2001). The most effective way for educationalpsychologists to increase self acceptance and resilience in LGB pupils (both those who are‘out’ and those still in the ‘closet’) is by directly working with school staff to challengeunhelpful practices. 2.8.2 Family Therapy Approaches – nurturing queer youthThe identity formation models have focused on the individual. The family therapyliterature is beginning to address family issues in the coming out process (e.g. LaSala,2000; Sanders & Kroll, 2000), but this remains limited. The issues are not adequatelyaddressed in family therapy practice. It has been suggested that this is because of atendency to confuse sexual identity with sexual practice. Adults are uncomfortable withtalking about sexual practice with young people (Stone Fish & Harvey, 2005). It has beenrecognised that family meetings can provide parents with the education, modeling andsupport they need to accept their child’s LGB identity (Saltzburg, 1996). It should beacknowledged that families can experience their own process of coming out as theyintegrate the child and family’s new identity (Coleman & Remafedi, 1989). Familymembers often desire a heterosexual outcome for their child. ‘We want our children’s lives66 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsPsychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 67to be easy and those who live on the margins know how difficult it is when the rulebookwas not written with you in mind’ (Stone Fish & Harvey, 2005, p.27).Narrative therapy has been used with parents who are coming to terms with their LGBoffspring’s coming out, providing a framework for reauthoring stories and adjustingidentities as they negotiate the challenge of becoming LGB-membered families (Saltzburg,2007). Stone Fish and Harvey (2005) have detailed an approach to family therapy whichthey call ‘nurturing queer youth’. They describe the therapeutic tasks as creating a refugethat can validate the unique pressures faced by LGB youth, lessen isolation by promotingidentification with similar others, and promoting a sense of uniqueness while improvingthe family context so that it can hold all of its members. Overall, the approach helps towork with families through the transition from a family of heterosexuals to multiple sexualidentities in the same household.2.8.3 Working at the institutional levelApplied psychologists can promote primary prevention activities by involving themselves inor supporting public and institutional policy decisions regarding LGB youth (Coleman &Remafedi, 1989). They can also support community groups for LGB youth which provideimportant sources of social networks and sometimes a necessary refuge from toxicenvironments. Research in the UK suggests that many schools do very little to counter prejudiceassociated with LGB issues, either directly through mentoring, counselling and equalopportunities policies, or indirectly through the curriculum and the general ethos of theschool (Adams, Cox & Dunston, 2004; Douglas et al., 1997). Until Section 28 of the LocalGovernment Act1 was repealed in 2003, many schools in England and Wales2 used thislegislation to justify a failure to address issues of homosexuality. Section 28 would not haveprevented an objective discussion of homosexuality within the classroom, or thecounselling of students concerning their sexuality (Department for Education and ScienceCircular, 5/94). In practice, Section 28 delivered the message that there were ‘legalrestrictions on the discussion of sexuality in schools and in reproducing inequality andprejudice more widely in society’ (Epstein, 2000, p. 387; see also Ellis & High, 2004). Eventhough Section 28 has now been repealed, a significant number of schools (and localauthorities) still operate as if it is still in place and seem unaware that their activities arenot as restricted as they might believe (Adams et al., 2004). 2.8.4 Positioning of Self (as a Psychologist)The appropriate use of therapist self-disclosure of personal information has the subject ofdebate for many years. However, most contemporary therapists agree that some degree ofself-disclosure can be therapeutically useful under specific conditions. This includes thejudicious use of disclosure of the therapist’s sexuality. Indeed, many aspects of thetherapists identity will, of course, already be apparent, for example, age, gender, skincolour and (unless otherwise explicitly addressed) there may well be an assumption ofheterosexuality. In considering disclosure sexual orientation it is important that clinicians1 Section 28 of the Local Government Act was a piece of legislation introduced by the ConservativeGovernment (1979–1997) that made it illegal for local authorities to ‘promote the teaching in anymaintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship’.2 Scotland and Northern Ireland had their own versions of this legislation, both of which have now beenrepealed.are fully aware of the requirements of the Health Professions Council Standards ofConduct, Performance and Ethics (HPC, 2008). These responsibilities are fully set out inClear Sexual Boundaries between Healthcare Professionals and Patients: Responsibilities ofHealthcare Professionals (CHRE, 2008) which is described in Part I of this guideline. Thereport also provides a definition of sexualised behaviour, which is described as, ‘acts, wordsor behaviour designed or intended to arouse or gratify sexual impulses or desires’.Therefore practitioners who disclose their sexual identity to their clients when motivatedby their own need for sexual arousal or gratification are violating professional boundaries.In view of the potential for misunderstandings, the Society has a duty to its members tohighlight the potential risks of self-disclosure of sexuality in relation to the possibility ofcomplaints being made against them.Practitioners considering disclosing their own sexual orientation to clients are advised toexercise appropriate caution by ensuring that they examine carefully their own motivesand also consider the possibility that the client could potentially misconstrue their reasonsfor making such disclosure.2.9 Ethical issues and the LawSpecific ethical considerations and legal issues hold particular significance when workingwith adolescents around their sexuality and sexual behaviour. The age of consent forsexual activity (now 16 for males and females) stands irrelevant to sexual identity.Psychologists working with LGB youth may find themselves cognizant of sexual activitytaking place between adolescents under this age, or more problematically, when onepartner is below the age of consent, and the other above it (the latter then legally holdsculpability). It is the psychologist’s task to make the adolescents involved aware of the legalposition, whilst assessing the situation to determine the competency of parties to consentto and enter into this activity. Competence would need to be examined, as well as theidentification of any possible coercion or abuse. Local child protection professionals canbe consulted to aid this process. However, prejudices and stereotypes about same-sexactivity can sometimes cloud the advice and judgements offered. The principles of Gillickcompetence and the Fraser guidelines (Wheeler, 2006) support the psychologist indetermining a client’s competence to consent to treatment in the form of psychologicaltherapies, particularly around issues of sexual identity. A young person under 16 mayrequest this work without the knowledge of parents or legal guardians. They may seek toprotect the confidentiality of this contact for many reasons. Often for fear of adults’reactions to the disclosure of a sexual identity this work would create or indeed, for fear ofadults’ reactions to the undertaking of this psychological work per se. Some parents mayfear that this work encourages the development of a sexual identity that they reject fortheir offspring. Advocating same-sex exploration for instance can be risky for theprofessional (Coleman & Remafedi, 1989). Sobocinski (1990) tells the story of a father of a16-year-old male in therapy who threatened to sue the therapist for negligence, forteaching his son to become a ‘social deviant’. Clearly, the assessment of risk around ayoung LGB person will be no different to any young person, where confidentiality can becompromised if risk to self or others is judged to be present. When working with sexualityand sexual behaviour, this can involve risk relating to unsafe sexual practice, as well aspossible coercion or abuse.68 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients3. Education, training and professional development3.1 Education, training and professional development needs of psychologistsThere is increasing consensus amongst trainers that self reflection about a psychologist’sown beliefs around sexuality and sex are essential for an applied psychologist to be able towork effectively with clients from sexual minorities irrespective of the setting andtheoretical approach (Davies & Neal, 2000, Murphy, Rawlings & Howe, 2002). Withinclinical psychology training there is some evidence that sex and sexuality training isprovided inconsistently (Shaw, Butler & Marriott, 2008) leaving qualified psychologists witha general lack of knowledge and confidence in discussing pertinent issues that might affectlesbian, gay or bisexual clients (Snowdon-Carr, 2005; Murphy et al., 2002). There havebeen some attempts to set minimum standards for training courses around sex andsexuality training by the Society’s Faculty of HIV and Sexual Health in their good practiceguidelines for the training and consolidation of clinical psychology practice in HIV/sexualhealth settings and provided sexuality CPD workshops (DCP, 2007; Butler & Shaw, 2007).The DH, the biggest employer of clinical psychologists in the UK, has recently issued core-training standards for working with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients in order to preventdiscriminatory practice (Department of Health, 2006) that reflects the Equality Act onsexual orientation (HMSO, 2007).● In this country there have also been some attempts to look at psychologists’ practiceand attitudes towards sexual minorities in the UK. Milton (1998) replicated a surveyundertaken by the American Psychological Association (APA; Garnets et al., 1991),which explored counselling psychologists’ views on good and bad practice whenworking psychotherapeutically with lesbian and gay men. Unhelpful practice included:● an overemphasis on the relevance of sexual orientation in evaluating the problems ofgay and lesbian clients;● trying to change a client’s sexual orientation;● applying heterosexual frames of reference;● clients were assumed to be heterosexual;● not underestimating the effects of prejudice and discrimination on a client’sproblems; and● lack of knowledge about gay and lesbian issues. More helpful practice included: ● not trying to change the sexual orientation of a client without their request orevidence that it is relevant to the client’s problems;● facilitating the development of the client’s gay or lesbian identity;● making clients feel positive about themselves. This can be facilitated by a psychologist’s openness, comfort with and acceptance of sexualdiversity, the non-use of assumptions and stereotypes, an acknowledgement of the effects ofsocietal discrimination and prejudice, and knowledge of the issues faced by lesbian and gaymen. Milton also provided a series of recommendations about psychology practice andtraining, including developing consistency in training, emphasising the need for traineesto look at their attitudes and prejudices and also that the Society establish a committee(like the APA) on lesbian, gay and bisexual concerns to review and monitor practice.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 69Murphy et al. (2002) surveyed 378 clinical psychologists’ on treating lesbian, gay andbisexual clients. The survey asked about psychologists’ caseloads, training, mental healthconcerns and future training needs. It found that LGB clients were a significant part of theaverage caseload and that training was at best partially addressing these concerns, leavingpractitioners seeking further training after qualification. Annesley and Coyle (1995)looked at 69 clinical psychologists’ attitudes to lesbians by adapting Herek’s attitudes tolesbians and gay men questionnaire (1984) and found that three-quarters of respondentsprovided answers indicating positive attitudes with 84 per cent reporting feelingcomfortable working with a lesbian client. Sixty-three per cent believed that lesbiansshould not be allowed to adopt children or have artificial insemination. Positive attitudeswere linked more to their social experiences and low religiosity, rather than training orclinical experience. They again suggested the need for attitude and intervention-basedtraining of clinical psychologists. Ellis et al. (2002) looked at 226 psychologyundergraduate students’ attitudes towards lesbian and gay men and their support forlesbian and gay human rights. The study suggested a prevalence of negative attitudes inheterosexual students.3.2 Models of affirmative practiceModels of therapy have a historical and social context that leaves their principles open tointerpretation and development depending on the position that a psychologist may havearound sexuality and gender. Some theoretical orientations clearly have a history in whichprinciples and/or assumptions have led to oppressive treatment of people from sexual andgender minorities. However, affirmative practice can be integrated across all theoreticalapproaches, although more easily with some models than others. The term, ‘gay affirmative therapy’ is used inconsistently in the literature (Harrison, 2000).It has come to be associated with therapy with sexual and gender minority clients (thoughmore usually the former) in which a minority sexuality/gender position is valued equallywith a dominant sexuality/gender position, with practice informed by appropriateknowledge of minority communities, their diversity and specific needs. Concerns havebeen expressed about the term and, in particular, the use of ‘gay’ to denote affirmativework with all sexual minority clients (e.g. lesbian or bisexual) and the clear failure to referdirectly to gender minorities in the label. However, this term has gained acceptance and isused widely in the literature for affirmative therapy with both sexual and genderminorities. Langdridge (2007) distinguished between two forms of gay affirmative therapy: a ‘weak’version and a ‘strong’ version. The former describes the most common approach toaffirmative practice where minority identities and practices are valued equally withdominant identities and practices, with due consideration for minority cultures and theissues that such clients may bring to therapy. This entails psychologists engaging in aprocess of continuing professional development to ensure they are aware of the relevantissues for the clients that they work with. This rarely involves any significant alteration topractice within the context of the theoretical model that they work with. The ‘strong’version is much less common, and indeed more contentious, and refers to versions oftherapy in which the psychologist not only values minority identities and practices but alsouses the weight of their authority to actively affirm minority identities and practices anddirectly counter the effects of heterosexism. This may also be extended to include some of70 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clientsthe more radical revisions to extant theory and practice, most notably psychodynamictheory in which fundamental theoretical principles have been re-worked using ideas fromsocial constructionism, feminism and queer theory (see, for instance, Isay, 1989; O’Connor& Ryan, 1993).The series of three Pink Therapy books (Davies & Neal, 1996, 2000; Neal & Davies, 2000)represent one of the most significant expressions of affirmative practice in the UK, and,along with the recent addition of the edited collection by Moon (Moon, 2008; Butler,O’Donovan & Shaw, 2010; Richards & Barker, 2012), probably represent the clearestexpression of affirmative practice. The books by Perez, DeBord and Bieschken (2000) andRitter and Terndrup (2002) are similarly important US statements on affirmative therapy.There is limited empirical support for affirmative practice, a notable issue for the ‘strong’versions in which substantive changes are made to theory and practice. There have,however, been a small number of qualitative studies which have sought to explore theexperience of clients who have had affirmative therapy (Lebolt, 1999; Pixton, 2003). Thesestudies have shown how clients valued affirmative approaches and, whilst more research isclearly needed, provide some support for the value of such developments.3.3 Therapies focused on attempts to change sexual orientation(reparative or conversion therapies)Therapy based on the premise that non-heterosexual sexuality is a mental illness,pathological, ethically or religiously wrong, or a client should change their sexualorientation to heterosexual is fundamentally counter to an ethical or human rightsapproach to therapy (APA, 2000b; Haldeman, 1994). However, it is increasingly becomingrecognised that sexuality can be seen on a continuum from heterosexual to homosexualinvolving some degree of flexibility and change over a lifespan (Kinsey, Pomeroy & Martin,1948; Kinsey, 1953). Clients may wish to review aspects of their sexuality and this needs tobe assessed on a case-by-case basis.There have been treatments applied to clients focusing on this, including:1. Reparative therapy (Nicolosi, 1991) that is based on the premise that gay or lesbianadjustment is never a satisfactory resolution of sexual identity. This has also been usedinterchangeably with the term Conversion therapy used to describe therapy aimed atchanging a person’s sexual attraction/arousal. Reparative therapy is invariably linkedto fundamentalist religious organisations, hence the notion of ‘repairing’ a‘damaged’ sexuality. ‘Conversion’ therapy is used by opponents of these positions tohighlight the fact that it more properly implies an attempt to engage in religiousconversion. This is particularly carried out in the USA and the National Associationfor the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality is the organisation that provides thisapproach. However there is a growing trend towards reparative therapy in the UK.2. Early psychoanalytic understanding was based on the notion that same-sexorientation resulted from developmental arrest (Freud 1905/1953). There have beenattempts among recent psychoanalytic writers to posit more progressive and positiveunderstanding of different developmental trajectories.3. Behavioural aversion therapy and systematic desensitisation using emetics andelectric shocks based on the notion that social learning results in sexual orientation(e.g. Barlow, 1973).4. Medical treatments such as sterilisation, lobotomy and clitoridectomy.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 71These were routinely offered when homosexuality was viewed as a mental illness prior tothe DSM-111-R revision in 1987 and are now mainly viewed as unethical on theoreticalgrounds with very little evidence for effectiveness and some for harm.The American Psychiatric Association (2000b) issued a helpful position statement ontherapies focussed on attempts to change sexual orientation suggesting:1. That homosexuality is not a diagnosable disorder and efforts to re-pathologisehomosexuality by claiming clients can be cured are often guided not by rigorousresearch but religious or political forces opposed to full civil rights of gay men andlesbians.2. That as a general principle a therapist should not determine the goal of treatmentcoercively or through subtle influence. 3. That the reparative therapy literature uses theories that make it difficult to ethicallyresearch the treatments proposed as it actively stigmatises clients.3.4 Therapies focused on attempts to change other aspects of sexuality or genderTherapy aimed at ‘normalising’ behaviour, reparative therapy, has also been unsuccessfullyattempted to address gender issues in trans youth and with trans adults. Other examples ofapplication of reparative therapy to well adjusted individuals have included people whopractice consensual BDSM; and people who have a fetish which is integrated into their liveswithout impairment to daily activities, social relationships or mental well-being. Motivations for therapy to address transgressive behaviour should be carefully considered,as the psychologist may be taking a moral or religious stance which is inappropriately beingbrought into the therapeutic space. In contrast some psychologists act, with apparentcompassion, to ameliorate the client’s distress at their practice or identity, or in the beliefthat that distress must inevitably follow from an act or identity that is subject to a great dealof opprobrium. Two issues are pertinent here: the psychologist’s understanding of theclient’s act or identity; and any internalised phobia that the client is experiencing. We shallexamine them in turn.The psychologist’s assumption that an act or identity is necessarily distressing may bewrong (see, for example, the BDSM section above) and the subsequent therapy forsomething that is not distressing to the client is of limited utility. The psychologist shouldnot bring assumptions into the therapy space and should instead either refer appropriatelyto a specialist practitioner, or support the client in accessing useful resources such asinternet sites, books and magazines. These resources can explore transgressive identitiesand practices from a less pathologising perspective, as the information within the generalmedia and even mainstream clinical professional literature can be somewhat limiting, andoften does not cover non-pathologising ideas and theories. Internalised phobia, such as internalised transphobia, may strongly motivate a client towardsreparative therapy. However it would be counter therapeutic for the psychologist to add tothat internalised phobia through therapeutic practice. Especially in the case of identities,cessation of practice is not the same as cessation of desire and the client will be left withunexpressed feelings that have the potential to be very damaging. Instead, the psychologistshould attempt to be non judgemental of the client’s practice per se and engage withattendant consequences, whether cognitive, affective or social. Should the client wish tomodify their practice that can be facilitated in a manner that does not denigrate it.72 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsIt is of particular importance in this area to establish for whom the difficulty is a problem.For some clients, coming to therapy is an attempt to please others or is on the instructionof others, as in the case of parents who bring their gender variant children to therapy to benormalised to gendered social roles. Or a man who has come to therapy to satisfy a femalepartner who does not like him wearing traditionally female clothing. Sometimes clientswho enjoy BDSM present in a clinical setting because their partners are unsupportive andwant them to change. In these instances psychologists should remember who the client isand to act in the client’s best interest, whilst taking into account their social and familyrelationships. The client should not be situated de facto as having the problem throughtheir coming to therapy (cf. Rosenhan, 1973). Applied Psychologists do need to carry outadequate assessment and identify those clients who may be better referred to a specialistpractitioner and service. They should not act beyond their competence if the presentingproblem(s) fall outside their areas of expertise. This is clearly distinct from the use of‘reparative therapy’, which is more motivated by social norms rather than significantclinical need. 3.5 Continuing Professional DevelopmentWorking with people with diverse sexuality and gender issues throws up manycontemporary, changing and often challenging concerns for psychologists who also have tonavigate a backdrop of many constructs around aspects of diversity that have beenentrenched in heterosexism, and which may connect to a broader socio-political climateand cultural issues, such as immigration. For this reason training and consideration ofclinical issues should continue post-registration, even for psychologists who may work withclients or settings that present more sexual and gender diversity issues. This could take theform of discussion groups, informal networks of psychologists working with similar issues,reading, supervision, research and training.Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority Clients 7374 Psychology and Sexual and Gender Minority ClientsReferencesAdam, B.D.
