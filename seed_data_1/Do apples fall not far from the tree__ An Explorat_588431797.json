Bayaua, Franz Joseph B. Beltran, and Rei Czelle M. Rodrigo  Abstract: The parent-child interaction is the first social connection a child would engage within their life. A part of this relationship is how parents develop their child in the physical, mental, and emotional aspects. These varying aspects then extend to the attitudes and perceptions the child may have toward different aspects of life, including social issues such as those concerning the LGBTQ+ community. The following study seeks to explore the influence of parents to their children’s attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. It is in this context that this study is proposed where the assumption is that the parents’ attitude towards queer identity and community will be shared with their child.  The study had gathered its data from 18 self-identified cisgender and heterosexual De La Salle University senior high-school adolescents in Metro Manila who are at or above the age of 18. Contrary to the research assumption, it was found that majority of the respondents had a positive perception of the LGBTQ+ community and its members despite some parents having homophobic or generally negative perceptions and tendencies towards the community. This implies that adolescents possess a certain level of agency when it comes to relating and empathizing with minority communities, particularly that of the LGBTQ+ community. Given these results, the researchers of the study recommend that future explorations on the subject delve into studying the thought process of those below the age of 18, particularly those who are 12-17 years old, in order to gauge the potential difference and similarity in perspective.    Key Words: queer, LGBT, family, relationship, attitude  1. INTRODUCTION The family is the most fundamental and simplest unit of society. More often than not, the parents are the first sources of information for a child, setting up the cornerstones of a child’s rudimentary education. Depending on the quality of the education that these parents have given their children, in a digital age where information on almost any topic under the sun is available to be perused by the general public, it may be up to the child and external educational institutions to fill in the blanks or completely revise these teachings. The article aims to tackle the impacts of the knowledge gained, particularly on the LGBTQ+ community, of a child from their parents and how the child utilized their parent’s teachings and perceptions to mold their own perception of the LGBTQ+ community. The researchers of the article attempts to establish their position on closing the gap on the scholarly pursuits of LGBTQ+ studies based in the Philippines and advocates for a more substancial and concrete pedagogy on queer literacy in the country.  2. METHODOLOGY The researchers commenced the data gathering process with a preliminary survey. The survey assessed the quality of parent-child relationship among 188 respondents ranging from the ages of 15-20 years old from a population of 1,143 De La Salle University-Manila Integrated School students. The researchers collated the gathered data and created a tabulation to determine which students met the set standards. Based on the relative average calculated from the responses, the high, middle, and low levels of parent-child relationship were established where six (6) self-identified heterosexuals aged 17-19 were chosen for the interview. The prospective subjects were then contacted through email with the provision of additional consent forms and interview schedules. From there, the researchers conducted 30-minute to one-hour one-on-one semi-structured interviews for a total of 13 interviewees. The said interviews were conducted with the aid of interview guides that assessed four key parts: (1) parental attitudes towards the LGBTQ+, (2) parent-child relationship, (3) child’s queer literacy, and (4) 241 GENDER, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE INDIVIDUAL  personal attitudes towards the LGBTQ+.  The interview transcripts then underwent the processes of coding, assimilation of themes, and definition of themes. The research proponents first highlighted several key points or codes that they deemed useful in relation to answering the questions of the study. From the created codes, themes were formulated from the patterns that have emerged. In this stage, the transcripts were reviewed once again to assess the consistency of the themes in relation to the declarations of the respondents. Finally, the meanings of the themes were defined relative to the whole of the informants’ statements on the basis of the researchers’ obtained knowledge from various literary sources cited in their review of related literature (RRL)  3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In the study, seven out of the thirteen informants have shown a close relationship with their parents. This closeness was accompanied by a sense of open-mindedness when it came to understanding personal, political, or social discourse. The respondents shared that their parents often encouraged values of open communication, transparency, and an exchange of ideas. Communication was frequent, and both parents and children sought each other out for companionship, comfort, and advice. Among the seven, four respondents had reported that their parents held positive attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. The parents expressed openness to discuss LGBTQ+ related topics and issues, where they all shared positive and welcoming perceptions. This was shown through their conversations and exchanges. This behavior was also exhibited when the parents were around LGBT relatives and peers, where the informants saw that they were welcoming, warm, and friendly.  Two of the seven respondents’ parents had ambiguous or tolerant attitudes that were neither fully accepting nor hostile. Their tolerance primarily entails acceptance towards the LGBTQ+ where they are treated with mutual respect to a point of peaceful and non-violent coexistence. The ambiguity of their parents’ tolerant attitudes lies in their casual discriminatory or stereotypical behavior. This kind of behavior refers to their casual comments, jokes, and name-calling. One of the respondents recalls her mother, albeit generally tolerant, pertaining to masculine gays as “sayang” or a waste for not adhering to heteronormative standards. For the rest, their parents were said to have passed off jokes ridiculing the members and using terms like “bakla” or “tomboy” with a negative connotation. Though these remarks were present, they would not be outrightly said to anyone in the LGBT spectrum, rather it is uttered to their children in private.  One had parents who had negative attitudes towards the LGBTQ+. For one of them, the interview found that they saw their LGBTQ+ identity as a cause of their shortcomings although the individuals’ negative traits may be unrelated to their sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression (SOGIE). Six individuals reported a neutral to low quality of the relationship, saying it was “civil” and “fine” to explain their parental relationships. They have explained that communication happens mostly out of necessity, and the parents are the sole party to seek out the other. As a result, the exchange of ideas, from personal advice to political discourse is seldom. One had even mentioned that they perceive parent-child interactions as solely an obligation and inherently takes away from their choices and self-autonomy. Of the six individuals, two observed the same positive attitude in their parents as those with close bonds. Three had parents with ambiguous and neutral attitudes, while one had a negative perception of the LGBT community. The characterizations of these informants of their parents’ attitudes were generally the same as those who had close relationships. On the part of the one informant with parents dismissive of the LGBT community, it was also reported that there were displays of hostility towards members of the community, leading the child to describe their parents’ attitudes as “toxic” and “alienated”. The researchers have also found that there was a case of selectivity for one of the respondent’s parents. According to the said respondent, their parents would only tolerate members who are part of their circle and usually only if they are within their presence.   In developing a child's personality, the influence of parental attitudes is an influential factor (Zunich, 2012). Similarly, a few traits that may be reflected in the child based on the parenting style may be their physical appearance, gender, and temperament. In contrast to this, parent-child relationships with negative connections create more emotional distance between the two parties. When a parent lacks action in certain aspects such as trust, respect, or communication, this may negatively affect the child's behavior and development (Altalib, 2013). Values and beliefs were shown to be attributed to adults' behavior and competence and their capabilities as children educators (Schaefer, 1991). The parent's own set of beliefs towards certain concepts are tailored from their behavior, among other factors. This is then reflected in how these parents molded the development of their children. Evidence is substantial that child development—and accordingly, children's skills—is influenced by family characteristics, such as 242 GENDER, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE INDIVIDUAL  parental education, income, and other factors contributing to parental quality (Rindfuss, 1992). Family-related factors contributing to parental quality seem to be particularly important, and it sets up child outcomes based on the quality of other caregiving and learning institutions, such as day-care centers or schools (Pew Research Center, 2015). Grusec and Danylluk (2014) examined how parents changed their behavior as they raisedchildren and how these behaviors impacted a child's development. They mainly concluded that a parent's attitude that can be described with warmth, along with reasonable levels of control, combine to produce positive child outcomes in terms of their attitudes.  Other than parental attitudes, the researchers also seek to discover whether 1evel of awareness on LGBTQ+ concepts and issues one has plays a significant role in adolescents' outlook on the LGBTQ+ community. This was tested to the informants by presenting different words, phrases, and sentences tied to the LGBTQ+ community and asking them to explain their understanding of it without any supplemental information. Out of all the respondents, 3 individuals showed a low level of such awareness. They were unable to clearly define gender and sexuality. The two individuals also failed to explain the concepts of social constructs, fluidity, and stated that they had no insight on how they perceived the representation of the LGBTQ+ community in mass media. There was a general lack of understanding in the concepts presented. One informant was even avoidant, saying that they did not want to learn queer concepts as they fear it would “make them queer”. This informant also called the concept of fluidity and intersectionality as “nonsense.”  Two individuals have exhibited a moderate level of such awareness. This meant that while they were familiar with the concepts presented, they were still unable to articulate its clear meaning, such as concepts like intersectionality and fluidity. Expressing a high level of LGBTQ+ awareness, 8 individuals were able to comprehensively explain all of the given concepts with ease. They were also able to add depth to merely explaining the textbook definition of the phrases by connecting them with their personal experiences, insights, and manifestations. The informants cited different sources of knowledge that have led them to such a level of queer literacy. For individuals with a high level of queer literacy, they have credited their knowledge to topics discussed at school, articles they read on social media, and most importantly, the insights they receive from their peers especially those who identify with the LGBTQ+ community. Liberal and inclusive spaces like universities also contributed to the high level of literacy. Nine of the informants said that though they learned some queer concepts at home and through their families, this knowledge was lacking and biased toward the attitudes of their parents. This prompted them to look for more sources of knowledge through alternative mediums. The informants who had a moderate to low level of queer literacy were unable to expound as  much on their sources of information. They have only gone as far as to cite subject topics and social media. Sj Miller (2015) coded the level of awareness towards the LGBTQ+ community as “queer literacy” or the ability to view gender and sexuality through a queer lens. In his work, he advocated for expanding knowledge on the LGBTQ+ community with the employment of a Queer Literacy Framework or QLF. According to him, a QLF will help teach students the empowerment of their sexualities and those of their peers. For this, Miller reasoned that gender and sex play significant roles in shaping students' perceptions of themselves and others. Furthermore, he stated that with the acceptance of sexual diversity, “violence would not prevail.” Ergo, conditions that encourage students to self-determine their gender and sexuality are vital in achieving gender and sexuality justice.  In essence, this means that a more comprehensive understanding and acceptance of the different LGBTQ+ identities would mean the lessening of gender-related crimes and abuse, leading to gender and sexuality justice. GLAAD’s 2016 survey on “Accelerated Acceptance” shows that education, increased knowledge, and consistent dialogue on LGBTQ+ identities and struggle is what leads to lower levels of discomfort towards the queer community, which in turn leads to less discrimination. Queer literacy examines one’s knowledge of gender and sex as constructs and fluid concepts, as well as its representation in mass media, and the importance of advocating for its equality.  Seven out of 13 informants have a positive attitude towards the LGBTQ+. They have all explicitly expressed their warm acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. A common theme was that they do not impose othering towards individuals from the said community. Instead, they believe that they should not be treated unfairly based on their SOGIE alone. Given this line of thought, they all share a strong advocacy of equity for the LGBTQ+ to a point where they educate themselves and the people around them. The five informants who have tolerant or ambivalent attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ essentially share the same beliefs with the rest. All of the interviewees have expressed their support over the community in the same ways. However, there 243 GENDER, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT, AND THE INDIVIDUAL  remains to be certain stereotypes and discriminatory characterizations that those with tolerant attitudes adhere to and exhibit. For example, one of the informants have said that they do not wish to fully immerse themselves among LGBTQ+ for it may change their SOGIE by way of influence. Another one has said that they find effeminate attitudes or expressions from males unbearable for being “weird” at some extent. Nonetheless, they claimed to still accept the LGBTQ+, including future children or intimate partners, and believe that they deserve the achievement of equity.  4.  CONCLUSIONS An individual’s childhood encompasses some of their most formative years. And so, for children who have lived said years under the care and influence of their parents, it is no question that their parents hold great responsibility in educating their children. In this day and age where the world is finally beginning to acknowledge the well-deserved rights of marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ community, it is only fair to adapt to such changes in ideologies.  The researchers’ study has found that the youth are generally more tolerating and positive towards the LGBTQ+ regardless of their parents’ notions. In other words, the results have shown an unpredictability in utilizing parent-child relationships as a sole determinant for adolescents' behaviors. However, the youth’s queer literacy remains contingent on their parents’ ideologies on the matter. This is because youth with parents who embody negative perceptions and attitudes require more intensive means and methods to gather information on queer knowledge. This conclusion then stands as an indictment of the intensely-lacking (or non-existent, perhaps,) LGBTQ+ positive pedagogy today. There is grave importance in establishing, supplementing, and supporting LGBTQ+ pedagogy founded on the premise of queer objectivity and literacy. As such, the inextricable link between knowledge and attitudes or actions must be utilized to empower the youth towards non-prejudicial and non-discriminatory principles as a means of protecting the LGBTQ+ community and standing as their allies. 5.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The researchers would like to express their gratitude to Dr. Madelene Sta. Maria, the adviser from Practical Research 1, for helping them set the foundation for what will be the center of the research. Through Dr. Sta. Maria’s contributions, the study was allowed to gain focus and clarity on a single feasible topic that could be continued by the research.  The researchers would also like to thank Dr. Malbarosa for expanding the knowledge on the philosophical aspects of research and why topics like that of what is being covered, is essential in contributing to a larger body of knowledge in the research and academe of the Philippines, especially in the LGBTQ+ studies, where localized studies are scarce. Lastly, the researchers would like to thank their mentor, Dr. Melvin Jabar, for helping them ground the objectives and methodology of the research and aiding in the rigorous revisions of the entire manuscript. Dr. Jabar’s contributions to the research are indispensable, with the aid in solidifying the structure and details of the research in its totality.  6.  REFERENCES  Alexander, J. (2008).

A part of this relationship is how parents develop their child in the physical, mental, and emotional aspects. These varying aspects then extend to the attitudes and perceptions the child may have toward different aspects of life, including social issues such as those concerning the LGBTQ+ community. The following study seeks to explore the influence of parents to their children’s attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. It is in this context that this study is proposed where the assumption is that the parents’ attitude towards queer identity and community will be shared with their child. The study had gathered its data from 18 selfidentified cisgender and heterosexual De La Salle University senior high-school adolescents in Metro Manila who are at or above the age of 18. Contrary to the research assumption, it was found that majority of the respondents had a positive perception of the LGBTQ+ community and its members despite some parents having homophobic or generally negative perceptions and tendencies towards the community. This implies that adolescents possess a certain level of agency when it comes to relating and empathizing with minority communities, particularly that of the LGBTQ+ community. Given these results, the researchers of the study recommend that future explorations on the subject delve into studying the thought process of those below the age of 18, particularly those who are 12-17 years old, in order to gauge the potential difference and similarity in perspective",
