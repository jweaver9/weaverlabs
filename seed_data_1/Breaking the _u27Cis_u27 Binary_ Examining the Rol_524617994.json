B ea i g he Ci  Bi a : E a i i g he R e M de  Effec  A g Ci ge de  Women and Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Individuals  An Honors Thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Honors in Political Science.  By Elizabeth Diamanduros Under the mentorship of Dr. Kate Perry  ABSTRACT While recent strides have been made regarding more transgender and gender non-conforming individuals (TGNC) running for and being elected to political office in the United States, only 64 individuals who identify as part of the community are currently serving elected office (LGBTQ Victory Institute 2021). Though cisgender women have also faced political underrepresentation, higher rates of cisgender women have campaigned for and won elected office at all levels of government in recent years. Previous research illustrates the differences between the political and societal situations of these groups, including drawing attention to the elements of visibility and viability the Role Model Effect and its impact on political engagement among cisgender women. However, past research has not examined whether the recent rise in cisgender women candidates has impacted the political interest of other marginalized groups. In my study, I address this gap and argue that active inclusion of issues relevant to the TGNC community is needed in order for the candidacies of cisgender women to have an impact on TGNC indi iduals  interest in running for political office. I designed an original experiment to test this theory, and initial results show support for this hypothesis, adding to research addressing the role of identity in politics.

Illustrati e e amples include Andrea Jenkins  in in Minnesota in 2017, making her the first openly transgender Black woman elected to office in the US; Sarah McBride s in in Dela are in 2020, making her the first transgender senator at the state le el; along ith Mauree Turner s in in Oklahoma, making them the first non-binar  indi idual elected to a state s legislature (Frost and Ngu en 2019; McDaniel and Garcia 2020). Despite this progress, there are only 64 individuals currently serving elected office in the US who identify as part of the TGNC community (LGBTQ Victory Institute 2021).  At the same time, the TGNC community, which consists of approximately 1.4 million adults in the US, continues to experience discrimination on the state and federal government level (Flores et al. 2016). In 2017, President Donald Trump enacted a ban barring transgender individuals from serving in the military, which was only repealed in 2021 by President Joseph Biden after taking office (Detrow 2021; Eltohamy 2021). 2021 also brought a rise in discriminatory legislation against the TGNC community, particularly regarding trans athletes and gender-affirming medical care. Ten states have signed legislation or passed an executive order that bars trans girls and women from participating in sports that reflect their gender identity, with 3 states passing similar bills which were later vetoed and 23 other states proposing similar legislation (Chen 2021).  Regarding healthcare, 20 states have proposed legislation that would bar youth from accessing medical treatment to affirm their gender identity in 2021 (Block 2021).  4 Gender-affirming medical care, which includes pubertal suppression or puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or surgery for those over 18 years of age, is supported by research finding that access to such care improves the mental health of TGNC individuals and is potentiall  lifesa ing  (American Ci il Liberties Union 2021; Block 2021; The Tre or Project 2020; Weber 2022). States have continued to propose legislation and opinions targeting the TGNC community in 2022. In February 2022, for instance, Texas state government officials aimed to target TGNC young people by calling on state medical professionals and teachers to report guardians of TGNC youth who have received forms of gender-affirming medical care (Torchinsky 2022). As of March 2022, approximately 58,000 TGNC young people live in states that have enacted legislation limiting young people from accessing gender-affirming medical care (Conron et al. 2022). In addition, rates of violence against the TGNC community have continued and even increased, with rates of murder or suspected murder of TGNC individuals as measured midyear in 2020 surpassing the total number in 2019 (National Center for Transgender Equality 2020).  While definitions of specific identities in this community vary, most current research similarly defines important terms and identifications. For instance, transgender persons are defined as those hose gender identit  differs from the se  the  ere assigned at birth  (American Ps chological Association 2015; Human Rights Campaign n.d. b; The Tre or Project n.d., 3). Genderqueer is often used as an umbrella term  to refer to indi iduals hose gender identit  does not align ith a binar  understanding of gender,  ith some genderqueer indi iduals also identif ing as non-binary, genderfluid, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, or other gender identities (American Psychological Association 2015, 31; PFLAG 2021).   5 Non-binar  indi iduals are defined as those hose gender identit  is not e clusi el  male or female,  hereas gender non-conforming persons are defined as those ho do not identif  in a a  that conforms to the traditional e pectations of their gender,  ith some also identif ing as transgender or non-binary (Fiani and Han 2019; James et al. 2016, 6-7; The Human Rights Campaign n.d. b; The Trevor Project n.d., 2). Similarl , genderfluid indi iduals do not identif  ith a single fi ed gender  and ma  mo e among genders  (PFLAG 2021; The Human Rights Campaign n.d.). Agender indi iduals do not identif  ith or e perience an  gender  (PFLAG 2021; Wamsle  2021). Two spirit is a term used among Indigenous and Native American communities to signif  Indigenous persons ho traditionall  ere considered neither men nor omen; they occupied a distinct, alternative gender status  (Indian Health Ser ice n.d.). Individuals who identify with one or more of these groups are therefore represented here under the umbrella term of TGNC. On the other hand, cisgender indi iduals, or people hose gender identit  aligns with the sex they ere assigned at birth,  maintain the majorit  of positions at all le els of government in the US (Fiani and Han 2019; James et al. 2016, 6-7; The Human Rights Campaign n.d. b; The Trevor Project n.d., 2). In particular, more cisgender women continue to be elected to office at all levels of state and federal government. Regarding the 2020 congressional elections, 143 women were elected to serve in Congress from the previous number of 127 in 2018 (Rutgers 2021).  Previous research on cis women in politics has looked into how the increase of cis women running for office contributes to a Role Model Effect, or an influence on the political interest of other cis women and men (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006). Regarding  6 TGNC individuals, past research addresses the political and societal challenges the TGNC community faces due to their gender identity, which undoubtedly differs to the challenges faced by cisgender women. However, there are openings for investigation into whether there are connections between more cisgender women running for political office and the political candidacies of TGNC individuals. Such connections are based on the discrimination, though distinct from each other, that cisgender women and TGNC individuals in US society and government. In my study, I examine the extent to which the rise of cisgender women running for and being elected to office has contributed to a Role Model Effect influencing TGNC individuals to run. I argue that recognition of issues relevant to the TGNC community is the vital factor in this relationship. Since TGNC individuals face different challenges in society and in the political sphere than cisgender women do, it is essential that cisgender women candidates focus on and make issues relevant to the TGNC community visible in order for the Role Model Effect to expand its impact to TGNC individuals.  While more people representing diverse and historically politically underrepresented communities are beginning to run for and be elected to political office, the path to full and significant representation is still a long road ahead, especially for the TGNC community. More TGNC individuals in positions of elected office would influence other TGNC individuals to run and would allow for their concerns and interests to be represented, both important objectives for this community (Phillips 1998). Thus, increases in the political representation of TGNC individuals is imperative. In the words of Andrea Jenkins during her campaign for office, I belie e that representation  7 matters...As grandiose as it sounds, we are fighting for our democracy. We are fighting for our li es  (Lang 2017). In my thesis, I discuss the current literature on my topic, drawing attention to the political situation of the Role Model Effect involving cisgender women candidates along with the societal situation of the TGNC community and the political challenges they face. I connect the existing literature to the opening of a new focus which my theory provides, that visibility and inclusion of issues and concerns relevant to the TGNC community is key for cisgender women candidates to impact the political interest of TGNC individuals. Finally, I describe my original experimental method for testing my theory, ending with an analysis of the results from my study and how it fits into the current literature regarding political representation.   The Political and the Societal: Differing Perspectives Regarding Cisgender Women and TGNC Individuals Considerable research examines the patterns involving cisgender women in politics, particularly in relation to increasing the political engagement and representation of other cis women. Regarding the TGNC community, the literature focuses on the societal situation of TGNC individuals, including the challenges they face as well as the strengths found in engaging in collective community, along with the political situation of transgender candidates. In bridging the different areas of focus to look at how cisgender women in politics affect TGNC political candidates, my research gives way to new avenues of investigation regarding the Role Model Effect. Specifically, my research considers how politically underrepresented groups can influence other such underrepresented groups in their paths to political candidacy.   8 The Role Model Effect and Cisgender Women Research into the presence of primarily cisgender women in US politics and their influence on increasing omen s o erall political participation follo s different a enues but considers similar outcomes. This influence  is referred to as the Role Model Effect,  characteri ed as the presence of descripti e representation  that ill transform the political engagement of fello  group members  (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006, 244). It is worth noting that the Role Model Effect captures both increases in numbers of women candidates as well as perceptions of these candidates by the public.  Previous literature focuses on the elements of visibility and viability within the Role Model Effect. The factors of visibility include how visible the campaign is due to media coverage or awareness, which is often influenced by the visibility of the position the candidate is running for (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017; Ladam, Harden, and Windett 2018). For instance, past literature centers on the effects of female candidates running for higher levels of office, like Congress or state governor, along ith the effects of no el  female candidates, such as non-incumbent candidates (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017). The factors involved with viability involve the likelihood of the candidate winning the election based on how competitive the race for office is (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017). However, researchers note the contradictory nature of the theory of visibility: in order for a female candidate to be isible, there must be a areness of or attention to the candidate s gender (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017).  Regarding the specific effects of visibility and viability involved in the Role Model Effect, previous literature offers mixed findings. With women running for offices  9 held by men, there is support for the Role Model Effect on increasing levels of political engagement, specifically among younger women (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017). However, research on the influence of women in higher levels of office provides mixed e idence that these omen influence omen s political engagement, hich includes voting in elections, discussing politics, and engaging in political activism or political campaigns (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017; Dolan 2006; Lawless 2004). While there are conflicting findings, it is important to note that much of this literature discusses the effects associated ith omen s political engagement. M  research, on the other hand, is concerned with the effects associated with political ambition, which is described as the interest in running for political office (Fox, Lawless, and Feeley 2001; Fox and Lawless 2004).  Regarding cisgender omen s political ambition and its connection to the Role Model Effect, the literature offers largely supporting evidence (Bonneau and Kanthak 2020; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; Costa and Wallace 2021; Ladam, Harden, and Windett 2018). For e ample, some researchers report an increase in omen s political ambition when presented with information on the rise of women running for office overall and on the rise of women running for higher positions, in relation to the visibility component of the Role Model Effect (Costa and Wallace 2021; Ladam, Harden, and Windett 2018). Looking at the impact of an actual candidate and their gender presentation on omen s interest in running, Bonneau and Kanthak (2020) note slight increases in political ambition among women who supported the candidate.  Research regarding female candidates  influence on men s political ambition also offers conflicting views (Bonneau and Kanthak 2020; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2017;  10 Costa and Wallace 2021). Some research indicates small increases on the political ambition of men with more women candidates, while other research indicates no effect or negative effects (Bonneau and Kanthak 2020; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2017; Costa and Wallace 2021).  Considering the role of gender, other research e amines the gender s influence on female candidates compared to male candidates, particularly in relation to the candidate emergence stage  (Fo  and La less 2004). This stage encompasses the phase in which a person makes the decision to declare a candidacy (Fox and Lawless 2004).  This candidate emergence stage is of particular significance given that previous literature has shown there are less differences between men and women who run for office (Fox and Lawless 2004). For instance, both men and women possess similar likelihoods of winning a primary election or a general election and possess similar levels of political ambition (Fox, Lawless, and Feeley 2001; Fox and Lawless 2004; Lawless and Pearson 2008). Despite this, there are some differences based on gender regarding this phase. Women candidates come up against more competition particularly in primaries (Lawless and Pearson 2008). Men are also still more likely than women to decide to run for office (Fox, Lawless, and Feeley 2001). With the consideration that gender differences are more salient in the candidate emergence stage, researchers also note the significance of self-perceived qualifications of women in their decision to run for office (Fox, Lawless, and Feeley 2001; Fox and Lawless 2004).     11 Society and the TGNC Community Regarding the TGNC community in the US, previous research not only draws attention to the identities held by transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, but also draws attention to the different societal barriers and struggles regarding discrimination that those in the TGNC community face. Past research highlights the importance of recognizing identity and accessing services through discussing how TGNC individuals face struggles with the legal recognition of their gender identity, particularly when completing legal documentation or forms (Fiani and Han 2019; Ryan 2020). Additional research discusses the struggles faced by TGNC individuals due to the overall lack of access  to healthcare ser ices, including mental health and gender-affirming care (Fiani and Han 2019; Grossman and D Augelli 2006; R an 2020).  Concerning issues involved with discrimination, previous literature gives light to the distinction between types of discrimination of TGNC individuals. These forms include discrimination related to unequal treatment as well as violence, whether verbal, physical, or sexual (Clements-Nolle, Marx, and Katz 2006; Miller and Grollman 2015; Testa et al. 2012). Among TGNC racial minorities, combined discrimination based on their gender identity and racial identity is a significant problem (Jefferson, Neilands, and Sevelius 2013; Wilson et al. 2016). The impact of discrimination against TGNC persons is immense, as transgender individuals who report facing more discrimination of any form are more likely to have attempted suicide, have stress related to suicidal thoughts, have a history of drug or alcohol abuse, and have symptoms of depression (Clements-Nolle, Marx, and Katz 2006; Jefferson, Neilands, and Sevelius 2013; Miller and Grollman 2015; Testa et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2016). For transgender individuals who  12 report that others can read  that their se , gender identit , and gender e pression do not align,  the impacts of this felt  discrimination is compounded (Bockting et al. 2013; Miller and Grollman 2015, 813).  The issues and discrimination experienced among different groups in the TGNC community can be compared to the overall issues faced by TGNC people as a whole. Many TGNC individuals, and particularly non-binar  indi iduals, note the in isibilit  of their gender identity and lack of similar role models in society (Fiani and Han 2019; Nicholas 2019). US Society is more attuned to binary categories of gender, as people often distinguish between men and women. As such, the larger public is more aware and often more easil  accepting  of binar  identified trans indi iduals (Fiani and Han 2019; Nicholas 2019). Thus, individuals whose gender identity does not conform to the binar  categories of gender, including non-binary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals, face differing challenges and discrimination from that of binary identified transgender individuals (Fiani and Han 2019; Nicholas 2019). For example, research reports that non-binar  indi iduals are less likel  to affirm  their gender identit  socially and are less likely to have support from family members regarding their gender identity (Reisner and Hughto 2019).  Despite these challenges, a sense of the shared importance of community as a type of resiliency or protective factor, including recognition and visibility of other TGNC individuals, is a common thread expressed by those in the TGNC community (Bockting et al. 2013; Fiani and Han 2019). Forms of support for TGNC individuals, including support from family and community, are also associated with being a protective factor  13 against ps chological distress  or mental health problems (Bockting et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2016).   Politics and TGNC Individuals Research focusing on the US political sphere and TGNC candidates centers primarily on support for transgender rights along ith potential oters  ie s of transgender candidates. Overall, cisgender voters view transgender candidates running for political office negati el , particularl  ie ing trans candidates as more liberal  and as less representative of their views (Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021). In addition, transgender candidates are less likely to receive support from cisgender voters, even if both voter and candidate share the same political party identification (Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021).  Despite these troubling points, women voters, particularly gender non-conforming women, as well as liberal or Democrat leaning voters are more likely to support potential transgender candidates, particularly if the candidates align with their own political views and political party identification (Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021). Women voters and Democrat leaning voters are also more likely to support transgender rights overall (Becker and Jones 2021; Harrison and Michelson 2019; Jones et al. 2018). Looking further into the types of groups who are more likely to support TGNC candidates, past research notes the influence of having experience with gender discrimination and views on differences between genders (Becker and Jones 2021). Specifically, those with experience of gender discrimination  14 and those who view there to be less differences among those of different genders are more likely to support transgender candidates. These individuals are also more likely to want additional protections and acceptance for transgender individuals in society (Becker and Jones 2021).   Opening for Further Investigation The ar ing characteristics of cisgender omen and TGNC indi iduals  paths to political candidacy leave room for different considerations. While the impacts of the Role Model Effect on cisgender omen s political engagement are mi ed, there is e idence of visible and viable women candidates having positive effects on the political ambition of other cis women (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017; Ladam, Harden, and Windett 2018). A comparison of the differences between cis women and TGNC individuals can also be drawn. While cisgender women face more barriers and challenges during the candidate emergence stage, transgender candidates continue to face challenges even during the election stage. Though cisgender women also face their own set of difficulties and struggles posed by society, TGNC individuals, despite progress in recognition and awareness of the community, continue to experience discrimination of their gender identity and an overall lack of awareness of their identity.  However, there are also points of convergence among cisgender women and TGNC individuals. While more cisgender women than TGNC individuals are running for and being elected to office, more political representation is needed overall for both groups, though especially for TGNC individuals. Though different, both groups have faced discrimination and issues of representation in politics and society. An important  15 consideration in comparing both groups is the literature reporting that women voters are more likely to support TGNC candidates (Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021). Experience of gender discrimination, which both groups share, is another factor influencing support for TGNC candidates (Becker and Jones 2021). Therefore, I take into account these differences and similarities, both political and societal, among TGNC individuals and cisgender women in order to identify whether or not the rise of cisgender women running for office affects the political ambition of TGNC individuals.  Theory  In examining the extent to which cisgender women running for office have influenced the candidacies of transgender individuals, it is apparent cisgender women and TGNC individuals both face difficulties during the process of declaring a candidacy, though there are unique challenges for TGNC individuals. Cisgender female candidates face more difficulty at the stage of deciding to run for office (Fox, Lawless, and Feeley 2001; Fox and Lawless 2004). On the other hand, TGNC individuals face challenges throughout the candidate emergence process, specifically during the election phase (Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021).  Despite these differences, both cisgender women and TGNC individuals still face underrepresentation and discrimination in politics based on their identity. Representation can be impacted in different ways, such as with the Role Model Effect of cisgender women candidates influencing the political engagement of other cisgender women  16 (Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006). The power of visible and viable candidates is of particular importance to this Role Model Effect (Atkeson 2003; Campbell and Wolbrecht 2006; 2017; Ladam, Harden, and Windett 2018). There are also other similarities among the political situation of cisgender women and TGNC individuals, including how women voters and voters with experiences of gender discrimination are more supportive of the TGNC community (Becker and Jones 2021).  Following Becker and Jones  (2021) research, I argue that omen are more supportive of TGNC candidates and rights for the TGNC community because of their shared similar experiences of gender discrimination. I extend the literature on the Role Model Effect by building on the presence of similar factors regarding representation between cisgender women and TGNC individuals. I propose that the power of visibility and viability of cisgender female candidates contributing to the Role Model Effect among cisgender female candidates can be transferred to TGNC individuals. While previous literature takes the factors of visibility and viability of candidates into account concerning  impacts on political ambition, I  offer a new area of consideration by looking into the issues prioritized by candidates. I argue that for the Role Model Effect to produce similar positive effects on TGNC potential candidates as on cisgender female potential candidates, the recognition and inclusion of TGNC indi iduals b  cisgender omen running for office must be added to this isibilit  and viabilit  component. More specificall , cisgender female political candidates must actively make space for and work with TGNC individuals. This includes having an active focus on issues and concerns relevant to the TGNC community in their campaign, employing TGNC individuals on their campaign staff, or working with and listening to  17 the responses and views of TGNC potential voters in order for there to be a significant effect on the interest of TGNC individuals in running for office. As such, I propose the following hypotheses: H1: If more cisgender women run for office regardless of whether they address the concerns of TGNC individuals, then the level of interest among cisgender women in running for political office will increase.  H2: If cisgender women running for office address the concerns and interests of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals, then the level of interest of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals in running for political office will increase slightly.  Research Design For my study, I conducted an original experiment involving political messaging b  a h pothetical cisgender female candidate to e amine ho  the candidate s issue prioriti ation influences cisgender omen and TGNC indi iduals  interest in running for political office. Following the precedent of Iyengar et al. (1982) in the development of e perimental research in the field, I conducted a stud  using e perimental in estigations  to test and e amine the potential Role Model Effect of cisgender omen running for office on the political ambition of TGNC individuals. As Druckman et al. (2006) define in their discussion of the development of experimental political science research, an e periment denotes a t pe of methodolog  ith an unri aled capacit  to demonstrate cause and effect  (627). Guided b  this, m  e periment seeks to in estigate or search  for facts to e amine the causal connection bet een m  groups of focus (Druckman et al. 2006). As part of my experiment, I used survey questions given to cisgender female and TGNC participants that included prompts of a hypothetical cisgender female candidate to examine this potential effect.  18 Dependent Variables The dependent variables of my hypotheses are the level of interest in running for political office among cisgender women and the level of interest in running for political office among TGNC individuals, respectively. In particular, question 16 listed in Figure 1 in the Appendix and question 13 listed in Figure 4 in the Appendix ask the respondent to rate their interest in running for political office in the future  using a Likert Scale of ratings from 0, signifying no interest, and 10, signifying strong interest. To measure the dependent variables, I examined the responses of the participants in the experimental and control groups on the pre- and post-prompt survey questions regarding their level of interest in running for political office. I measured their level of interest before reading the prompts involving the hypothetical candidate as well as after reading the prompts.   Independent Variables The independent variables of my hypotheses involve an increase in cisgender female candidates running for office overall and cisgender women running for political office who support the TGNC community through actively addressing the issues and concerns of TGNC individuals. For my first independent variable, regarding cisgender female candidates, my survey included a control prompt of a hypothetical cisgender female candidate running on a platform that does not mention TGNC issues. This control prompt is included in Figure 3 in the Appendix.  For my second independent variable, regarding inclusion of interests and concerns of TGNC individuals by cisgender female candidates, my survey included an experimental prompt of a hypothetical female candidate running on a platform that  19 specifically mentions issues and concerns of the TGNC community. Specifically, the e perimental prompt contained a discussion of increasing access to gender-affirming healthcare  and an e pression of support for the Equality Act. This experimental prompt is included in Figure 2 in the Appendix.   Control Variables The control variables of my experiment are political party identification, racial identification, importance of religion, and knowledge of TGNC individuals and are listed in Figure 1 in the Appendix. To control for political party identification, Question 9 in the pre-prompt sur e  asked the respondent hich political part  the  most identif  ith.  I e pected participants ho identify as liberal or with the Democratic party to be more supportive of TGNC individuals and issues as compared to respondents who identify as conservative or with the Republican party. I specifically expected liberal leaning participants to be more supportive of the hypothetical female candidate discussed in the prompt, particularly in the experimental prompt with mention of TGNC issues, as supported by the findings in previous research regarding liberal leaning respondents and support of TGNC individuals (Becker and Jones 2021; Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021). I controlled for participants  political party identification in my study in order to ensure that political party alignment is not affecting the results of the measurement of the participants  political ambition.  Regarding race, question 8 in the pre-prompt survey asked the respondent to list the racial or ethnic groups ith hich the  most identif  ith.  I controlled for the  20 racial identification of the participants so that it is also not a factor influencing the results of the study, given that previous research involving views of TGNC candidates also controlled for race as well (Becker and Jones 2021; Jones et al. 2018).  Concerning views on the importance of religion, questions 10 and 11 in the pre-prompt sur e  asked the respondent if the  ie  religion as an important part  of their lives and to rate how important religion is in their daily lives. I expected participants who identify religion to be important in their lives to be less supportive of TGNC individuals and issues relevant to the TGNC community. Past literature supports this expected result in ol ing religious indi iduals  ie s on TGNC candidates (Becker and Jones 2021; Haider-Markel et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2018; Jones and Brewer 2019; Magni and Reynolds 2021). I also expected respondents who view religion as important to be less supportive of the hypothetical female candidate in the prompt, specifically with mention of TGNC issues in the experimental prompt. Thus, I controlled for the importance of religion so that it does not affect my findings related to political ambition.  Regarding the last control variable of pre-existing knowledge of TGNC individuals, questions 4 and 5 in the pre-prompt survey asked the respondent if they had any prior knowledge of TGNC individuals before taking the survey as well as if they have any people in their lives who identify as part of the TGNC community. I expected participants who have knowledge of TGNC individuals prior to the survey to be more supportive of TGNC individuals and issues, and to be more supportive of the hypothetical female candidate and her focus on TGNC issues in the experimental prompt. This expectation is supported by previous literature researching connections between knowledge of TGNC individuals and views on TGNC candidates (Becker and Jones  21 2021; Jones et al. 2018; Magni and Reynolds 2021). Since prior knowledge of the TGNC communit  could affect the participants  responses in the survey, I controlled for this variable as well.    Method of Analysis To test my hypotheses, I developed an online survey experiment as my method of analysis. In the experiment, the population consists of cisgender women and TGNC individuals of at least 18 years of age in the US. Following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, number H22148, I conducted the survey using a random sample of adult cisgender women and TGNC individuals in the United States. The sample was taken from Georgia Southern University students, faculty, and staff who responded to posts and emails that shared the survey information and from those who accessed the survey information shared on the Research Participant Opportunities  ebpage of the Office of Research at Georgia Southern University.  To expand upon the sample of respondents, I also distributed the survey on social media websites including Discord, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and GroupMe. The survey received responses from 48 participants. The survey consists of a pre-prompt survey to establish a baseline of information from the respondents, followed by a prompt for respondents to read concerning a hypothetical cisgender female candidate running for office, and finally, a post-prompt survey to measure respondent reactions to the prompt. The full experimental materials were compiled using Qualtrics software to protect the anonymity of respondents and to allow for efficient distribution of the survey.    22 Experimental Design  For the pre- and post-prompt survey questions, I used a combination of Likert Scale questions and open-ended questions designed to establish the basic self-described identities, political leanings, and general social and political attitudes toward political candidates of each respondent. Specifically, the pre-prompt questions included in Figure 1 in the Appendix detail the general information of the participant, their level of political ambition prior to viewing the prompt, whether they have any existing knowledge of the TGNC community, and their views of TGNC individuals running for office. The post-prompt questions included in Figure 4 in the Appendix detail respondent views of the hypothetical candidate described in the prompt as well as their level of political ambition after reading the prompt and how the hypothetical candidate may affect their level of political ambition. Using the survey platform Qualtrics, I randomly assigned participants into a control group and an experimental group. The control group consists of TGNC individuals as well as cisgender women who were given the prompt as outlined in Figure 3 in the Appendix. This prompt discusses a hypothetical cisgender female candidate and issues relevant to her campaign as well as other information regarding her campaign, with no specific mention of the interests and concerns of the TGNC community. The measurements of how participants in the control group react to the prompt with no mention or recognition of TGNC individuals and interests relevant to the community in the post-prompt questions serve as a comparison to the experimental group. The experimental group consists of TGNC individuals along with cisgender women who were given a prompt discussing a hypothetical cisgender female candidate  23 and the issues relevant to her campaign along with other information regarding her run for office. However, this prompt included specific recognition of TGNC individuals and a focus on concerns relevant to the TGNC community as outlined in Figure 2 in the Appendix. I measured the responses of the post-prompt questions from participants in the experimental group and compared the results to those of the control group, in order to e amine ho  an inclusion and focus on TGNC indi iduals affects participants  le els of political ambition.  Analysis and Results Given my theory that visibility and viability of issues important to individuals in the TGNC community are integral to the Role Model Effect of cisgender women running for office on the political ambition of TGNC individuals, I expected the survey results to reflect this. Upon completion of the survey submission period and analysis of results, I expected to find an increase in the interest level in running for political office among cisgender female respondents who were given the experimental prompt and among cisgender female respondents who were given the control prompt. I also expected to find an increase in the interest level of running for political office among TGNC respondents who were given the experimental prompt.   Overview of Respondents After receiving IRB approval, I sent out my survey and received responses from 48 participants. 46 of the participants listed their assigned sex at birth as female, while 2 participants listed their assigned sex at birth as male. The survey also asked respondents  24 whether they self-identify as TGNC, and 17 respondents considered themselves as part of the TGNC community, while 31 respondents did not self-identify as TGNC. However, when asked about their gender identity, the identities of 18 respondents fall under the TGNC umbrella I use in this thesis, with participants identifying as transgender, non-binary, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, and genderfluid. In addition, many of these respondents, which I classify as TGNC, identified as multiple different identities, including respondents identifying as both transgender and non-binary among other identities. 26 of the participants identified as cisgender women, while 4 participants identified their gender identity as unsure/questioning. Respondents who identified as unsure/questioning, regardless of if they also identified as TGNC or as a cis woman, were categorized as unsure/questioning. The demographic characteristics of the total sample and of the control and experimental groups are listed in Table 1 in the Appendix.   Interest in Running for Office  Initial results regarding the change in political ambition of the respondents show support for the hypotheses. While the n is not large enough to run a logistic regression, I examined the responses to provide descriptive statistics of all variables, which are pro ided in Table 2 in the Appendi . Concerning the measurements of respondents  interest in running, as aforementioned, participants rated their interest in running for political office on a Likert Scale from 0 to 10 when asked in both the pre- and post-prompt survey questions. However, it must be noted that only 36 of the participants in the sample responded to the post-prompt interest in running question. By breakdown of group and gender identity, 9 cis women and 8 TGNC individuals in the control group as  25 well as 7 cis women and 9 TGNC individuals in the experimental group responded to both political ambition questions. As such, I only examined the measurements of the political ambition of the cis women and TGNC participants in the control and experimental groups who responded to the questions asking for their interest in running in both the pre-prompt survey questions and in the post-prompt survey questions.   Looking at the pre- and post-prompt mean scores of political ambition among cis women, these results show increases in the control and experimental groups and are included in Figure 5 below. Of cis women in the control group, the pre-prompt mean score averaged to around 2 and increased to approximately 2.75. In the experimental group, cis omen respondents  mean score interest in running as around 1.8 and increased to a mean score of around 2.7 in the post-prompt. Considering the average rate of change in cis omen s interest in running, these results also reflect an increase and are represented in Figure 6 below. Among cis women in the control group, the average rate of change was around .44. In the experimental group, the average rate of change in political ambition among cis women was around .28. Thus, while the average rate of change in political ambition among cis women respondents was lower in the experimental group than in the control, the results do show support for Hypothesis 1.       26  Figure 5. Comparison of means in pre- and post-prompt political ambition among control and experimental groups   Figure 6. Comparison of average change in political ambition from pre- to post-prompt among control and experimental groups  27 Moving to the pre- and post-prompt mean scores of TGNC respondents  interest in running, the findings also show increases in political ambition in the control and experimental groups. These results are included in Figure 5 above. In the control group, the mean score of TGNC respondents  pre-prompt interest in running was about 1 and increased to a mean of 1.4 in the post-prompt. In the experimental group, their pre-prompt mean was about 1.5 and increased to a post-prompt score of 2.25. Regarding the average rate of change in interest in running among TGNC participants, the results also show support for an increase as represented in Figure 6 above. Among TGNC respondents in the control group, the average rate of change in their interest in running was around .38. In the experimental group, the average rate of change regarding political ambition of TGNC respondents was around .5, higher than the rate of change in the control group. As a whole, the increase in political ambition among TGNC participants in the control group is unexpected, but the results of TGNC participants in the experimental group show support for Hypothesis 2.   Other Findings of Note The responses to the control variables of the control and experimental groups and the overall sample are included in Table 1 in the Appendix. Regarding my control variable of political party identification, I classified the respondents based on their open-ended responses to question 9 in the pre-prompt. I classified 39 respondents as identifying as liberal or left-leaning. Among the respondents in this classification include participants ho identified as Liberal,  Democratic,  Centrist Left-Leaning,  or Independent Liberal.  Other participants in this classification identified ith the Democrat,  Social Democrat,  Socialism,   or Anarchism  political parties or  28 ideologies. I classified 9 respondents as identifying as independent. Among the respondents in this classification include participants ho identified  as Independent,  No Part ,  or No identification.  No respondents identified as conser ati e or right-leaning. This could influence the results to be skewed to more favorable views of the hypothetical candidate in the prompts, as well as the mention of TGNC issues in the experimental prompt. Regarding my control variable of racial identification, 41 of the respondents listed their racial or ethnic identification. The majority of respondents identified as white, with 27 respondents listing their race as white. 4 respondents listed their race as Black and 5 respondents listed their race as Asian. Among the 6 Hispanic/Latino respondents, 3 of these respondents also identified as white, while 3 listed their ethnicity, including Me ican,  Caribbean American,  or Nati e Caribbean.  I classified 3 respondents as mi ed race, as these respondents listed their identit  as Black and hite,  African American and hite,  or Japanese and hite.  1 respondent identified as Jewish, while 1 respondent identified as White Middle Eastern. It is important to note that the results will likely be less reflective of the political interest and views toward TGNC individuals held by minority groups given that the majority of respondents in the sample identify as white.  Regarding my control variable of importance of religion, I analyzed responses asking whether the respondent views religion as important in their life, as outlined in question 10 in the pre-prompt. I also analyzed responses asking participants who do view religion as important to rate the importance of religion in their daily lives, as outlined in question 11 of the pre-prompt and included in Table 2 in the Appendix. 13 respondents viewed religion as an important part of their lives. However, 33 respondents did not view  29 religion as important in their li es, and 2 respondents chose the option of prefer not to sa .   Of the 13 respondents who viewed religion as important, 3 respondents viewed religion as slightl  important,  5 respondents ie ed religion as moderatel  important,  and 5 respondents ie ed religion as er  important  in their dail  li es. Interestingly, 7 respondents who did not view religion as important still rated the level of importance of religion in their daily lives. Of these 7 respondents, 5 selected the option unsure/prefer not to sa  and 2 rated religion as slightl  important  in their dail  li es. In addition, the 2 respondents who did not specify the importance of religion in their lives rated the importance of religion in their daily lives. Of these 2 respondents, both rated religion as slightl  important  in their dail  li es. While 17 total respondents ie ed religion as holding some importance in their daily life, 33 respondents did not view religion as important in their daily life. With most of the respondents not viewing religion as important, this could influence the results to be more favorable of the hypothetical candidate in the prompts and to be more accepting of the candidate s focus on TGNC individuals in the experimental prompt. Regarding my control variable of pre-existing knowledge of TGNC individuals, all 48 respondents indicated that they had knowledge of the individuals who identify as TGNC prior to taking this survey. That all respondents held prior knowledge of TGNC individuals is important to note, as this will likely influence the results to be more supportive of TGNC individuals and to be more supportive of the hypothetical candidate in the prompt as well.   30 Conclusion Building on previous literature on the Role Model Effect among cisgender women, I examined the impact of cisgender women running for political office on the political ambition of TGNC individuals. I designed and conducted an original survey experiment which divided participants into a control or experimental group. Participants in the control group recei ed a prompt of a cis oman candidate s campaign ith no discussion of issues of concern to the TGNC community, while participants in the experimental group received a prompt of a cis woman candidate campaigning on issues relevant to the TGNC community. The results provide support for both hypotheses: that cisgender women candidates increase the political ambition of other cisgender women regardless of the issues the candidate campaigns on and that cisgender women candidates increase the political ambition of TGNC individuals when campaigning on issues relevant to the TGNC community.  However, my research also offers surprising findings. When looking at the average rate of change in political ambition among cisgender women, the interest in running for political office was higher in the control group than in the experimental group. Although the political ambition of cisgender women increased in both groups, these findings suggest that the impacts of cis women candidates on the political ambition of other cis women may vary in strength depending on the issues the cis woman candidate campaigns on. Regarding TGNC participants, the average rate of change in political ambition increased not only in the experimental group but also in the control group. As expected, the average rate of change in interest in running among TGNC participants in the experimental group was higher than among TGNC participants in the  31 control group. However, the increase in political ambition for the experimental group was more than twice as large as the increase for the control group. These findings suggest that cis women candidates may impact the political ambition of TGNC individuals regardless of the issues they campaign on, but that an inclusion of issues relevant to the TGNC community may hold a much greater impact. Though this thesis provides promising results, there are also limitations to consider. Due to the small n of this research study, I was unable to conduct a logistic regression, which raises concern regarding the applicability of the results to a wider population. Considering the demographics of the respondents, the majority of respondents identified as white and considered religion to not be important in their lives. In addition, no respondents identified as conservative or right leaning, and all respondents had prior knowledge of TGNC individuals. Though these variables were controlled for, it s important to note that this survey sample may not be representative of the entire population of cis women and TGNC individuals in the US.  However, this thesis still provides encouraging results to study further and expand upon. Future iterations of this project could include a larger sample of respondents to allow for a logistic regression analysis and to capture a more diverse sample. Additional research can further the contributions of this thesis and of other literature on the Role Model Effect by examining the impacts of representation on the political interest and political ambition of other politically underrepresented groups. For instance, future research might  consider the impacts of representation regarding racial minority groups, such as the impacts of white women candidates on the political interest of people of color or specifically women of color.  32 In sum, this thesis considers a new avenue regarding the Role Model Effect by investigating the impact of cisgender women candidates on the political ambition of TGNC individuals. This thesis also recognizes the importance of political representation and efforts to increase it among underrepresented groups. I believe this research helps bring light to the societal and political challenges faced by the TGNC community. It is my hope that future research continues to build on the factors influencing political interest and political ambition to help bolster political representation among all politically underrepresented groups.    33 Works Cited American Civil Liberties Union. 2021.

    "abstract": "While recent strides have been made regarding more transgender and gender non-conforming individuals (TGNC) running for and being elected to political office in the United States, only 64 individuals who identify as part of the community are currently serving elected office (LGBTQ Victory Institute 2021). Though cisgender women have also faced political underrepresentation, higher rates of cisgender women have campaigned for and won elected office at all levels of government in recent years. Previous research illustrates the differences between the political and societal situations of these groups, including drawing attention to the elements of visibility and viability the Role Model Effect and its impact on political engagement among cisgender women. However, past research has not examined whether the recent rise in cisgender women candidates has impacted the political interest of other marginalized groups. In my study, I address this gap and argue that active inclusion of issues relevant to the TGNC community is needed in order for the candidacies of cisgender women to have an impact on TGNC individuals’ interest in running for political office. I designed an original experiment to test this theory, and initial results show support for this hypothesis, adding to research addressing the role of identity in politics",
