However, there is little agreement \nabout what the term actually means, whether it means different things for different groups, what \nendorsement of essentialism (or its sub-components) means for attitudes, and how much this \nvaries depending on the relevant social context. This underlying lack of clarity helps to explain \nsome of the difficulty in understanding the relationships between essentialist beliefs about sexual \norientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. In the current project, I suggest a \nfundamental shift in the approach to this issue. Specifically, I examine the effects of essentialist \nbeliefs related to gender (rather than essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation) on \nheterosexist attitudes. In study one, I explore the interrelationships among gender- and sexual \norientation-related beliefs and attitudes toward gays, revealing that essentialist beliefs about \ngender are more consistent and unitary in their relationship to heterosexism than the sexual-\norientation related analogues. In my second study, I demonstrate a causal link by manipulating \nessentialist beliefs about gender. Increasing the salience of gender essentialist beliefs produced \nhigher heterosexism scores relative to decreasing the salience of such beliefs. Taken together, \nthese studies demonstrate the interconnectedness of sexism and the gender hierarchy with \nheterosexism and discrimination against gays. More importantly, study two forecasts a possible \nintervention strategy for reducing anti-gay prejudice.\n1 \n \n \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nOver the last few decades, research on the topic of essentialism has expanded greatly, and \nresearchers have become progressively more attentive to the implications of essentialist thinking \nfor social psychology. At its most fundamental level, essentialism can be defined as a belief that \ncategories have a set of defining or ‘essential’ features, or (put another way) that each category \nhas an underlying essence. As this concept has been explored in psychology, however, the term \nhas been used in a variety of ways, and while some variations are quite subtle and perhaps purely \nsemantic, others hint at a true divergence in what the concept of ‘essentialism’ implies, as well as \nits effects (Haslam, Rothschild, & Ernst, 2000). Much of the terminology employed in this area \nderives from language that was originally used to talk about categories that exist in nature \n(‘natural kinds’), and this creates some ambiguity when adopted to discuss categories that are \neither entirely socially constructed or imbued with social meaning beyond what the ‘natural’ \ncategory requires. \nThis ambiguity may partially explain the striking inconsistencies that have been observed \nwhen examining the relationship between essentialist beliefs about sexuality and attitudes toward \ngay men and lesbians. However, I believe the problems in deciphering this link are more acute, \nsuggesting a deeper process at work. The current project aims to resolve this difficulty by \nconsidering the relationship between heterosexism and essentialist beliefs related to gender, \nrather than essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation. I propose that the link from these \nbeliefs to attitudes toward gay men and lesbians will be more reliable and coherent, and may \nhelp shed to new light on the roots of anti-gay prejudice. \n2 \n \n Essentialist Beliefs – Kinds and Consequences \nPsychological research on essentialism has been around for at least a quarter of a century \n(e.g. Medin & Ortony, 1989; Rothbart & Taylor, 1992), however in 2000 Haslam, Rothschild, \nand Ernst broke new ground by taking a more systematic approach. Synthesizing several authors’ \nincorporation of essentialism into the field of psychology, they distilled nine basic elements of \nessentialism:  \nDiscreteness:  Boundaries between categories are sharp and clear-cut, not \nfuzzy and indefinite. \nUniformity:   Category members are highly similar to one another (also \ncalled homogeneity) \nInformativeness:   Knowing someone’s category membership can tell you a lot \nabout that person (also called inductive potential) \nNaturalness:   The category exists naturally rather than being artificially \ncreated \nImmutability:   Members in the category cannot easily become non-members \n(e.g. when membership is attributed to a biological cause) \nStability:    The category has always existed and its characteristics have \nnot changed much over time \nInherence:   Under the surface, category members have an ‘underlying \nreality’ or sameness \nNecessity:   There are certain characteristics without which one cannot be \na member of this category \nExclusivity:   Someone belonging to this category cannot belong to another \ncategory (within the same domain). \n  \nThey then empirically examined these nine types of beliefs as they applied to forty different \nsocial categories (e.g. males, Republicans, homosexuals) along twenty different domains (e.g., \nsex, political party, sexual orientation). Participants each rated only one of the two categories \nwithin each of the twenty domains, and these were counterbalanced. First by examining item \ninter-correlations, and then using exploratory factor analysis, Haslam et al. (2000) discovered \nthat these nine elements could be grouped along two independent dimensions, the first of which \n3 \n \nmost closely resembled a perception that a given category is a ‘natural kind’ (including the \nelements of discreteness, naturalness, immutability, stability, and necessity), and the second \nreflecting a belief that the category represented a coherent entity (including the elements of \nuniformity, informativeness, inherence, and exclusivity). For brevity, they named the first \ndimension “naturalness” and the second dimension “entitativity”.  \nExamining the mean of all participants’ ratings, Haslam et al. found that while \nnaturalness perceptions on their own were not significantly linked to the evaluative status of \ndifferent categories, entitativity perceptions were. Groups for which mean-level ratings of \nentitativity were high were generally perceived as having lower status. Most interesting, the \nauthors found an interactive effect between naturalness and entitativity, such that (although \nnaturalness was not linked to status on its own) groups that were highly rated on both dimensions \nwere seen as having the lowest status. \nOther researchers have developed different taxonomies for describing the way essentialist \nthinking operates in response to social categories. For instance, rather than viewing entitativity as \none independent dimension under the broader umbrella of essentialism, Yzerbyt, Corneille, and \nEstrada (2001) instead characterize it as a separate but related construct to what they term \n‘subjective essentialism’. Never the less, they emphasize that the two go hand in hand. They \npresent evidence of a bi-directional relationship between perceiving surface similarities among \ngroup members (entitativity) and inferring an underlying ‘essential’ cause (subjective \nessentialism). There is a constant dialogue, they argue, between perceived evidence and \nattributional beliefs. They also suggest that people may selectively perceive information in order \nto protect and maintain their essentialist categories.  \n4 \n \nIn an earlier study, Yzerbyt and colleagues found that perceived entitativity exacerbates \nthe (well-documented) tendency to attribute outcomes to dispositional rather than situational \ncauses (Yzerbyt, Rogier, & Fiske, 1998). While in their study entitativity was manipulated, the \nauthors point out that the tendency toward this type of thinking is also an individual difference \nvariable. Consistent with this suggestion, Bastian and Haslam (2006) found that a tendency \ntoward essentialist thinking about human attributes was predictive both of greater stereotype \nendorsement and also the belief that stereotypes about certain groups persist because of factors \ninherent to that group (rather than environmental or social causes).  \nThere is an interesting parallel between this observation and the basic tenets of system \njustification theory. In their 2004 review article, Jost, Banaji, and Nosek (2004) present the \nvarious mechanisms through which system justification tendencies work to justify inequality. \nSystem threat, they argue, can lead to greater stereotype endorsement in order to justify and \nmaintain the status quo. The desire to rationalize group differences is so strong, the authors \nmaintain, that even people disadvantaged by the inequality will see explanations for the group-\nlevel differences as more legitimate than they actually are. While at this point we can only \nspeculate, it is possible that lay theories related to essentialism play a role in this process. That is, \nessentialist beliefs related to gender may persist in part because of the psychologically protective \nfunction they serve, and people (including women) may endorse essentialist explanations for \nwhy inequalities between men and women endure. \nFollowing up on their 2000 findings, Haslam, Rothschild, and Ernst (2002) extended \ntheir investigation beyond mean-level (i.e. shared) essentialist beliefs about groups (and the \nlinkage of these shared beliefs to group status) to individual differences in endorsement of these \nbeliefs, and the individual level relationship between such endorsement and negative attitudes \n5 \n \ntoward the group in question. This study focused specifically on essentialist beliefs about \nwomen, black people, and gay men. The same basic factor structure  as was identified in their \n2000 article (naturalness versus entitativity) was replicated here, for each of the three social \ngroups.  \nParticipant ratings along the naturalness dimension tended to be high for evaluations of \nwomen and black people, but barely above the midpoint for evaluations of gay men. Ratings for \nthe entitativity dimension showed the opposite pattern (ratings well above the midpoint for gay \nmen, but slightly below the midpoint for women and black people). Further, while essentialist \nbeliefs about race and sex were not reliably predictive of racism or sexism1, essentialist beliefs \nabout sexual orientation were strongly (though not uniformly) predictive of attitudes toward gay \nmen. Perceiving homosexuality as changeable and informative was related to more negative \nattitudes, whereas perceiving homosexuality as an inherent and historically stable construct was \nrelated to more positive attitudes.  \nThese findings are especially interesting because they show that the relationship of \nessentialist beliefs to heterosexism is not unitary even when the dimensions of naturalness and \nentitativity are considered separately. That is, one might make the argument on the basis of \nHaslam et al.’s (2000) findings that entitativity should predict negative attitudes while \nnaturalness (on its own) might predict positive attitudes. However, inherence (the perception that \nbelow the surface, category members have an ‘underlying reality’ or sameness) was consistently \nfound to load more strongly with the entitativity dimension in all of the factor analyses \nconducted by the authors, yet the relationship between this variable and attitudes toward gay men \nwas positive. The authors speculated that the inconsistency may stem from a perception that \n                                                 \n1 But see Brescoll and LaFrance (2004), who found that manipulating the proposed explanation for a trivial gender \ndifference (as biological versus social) predicted endorsement of gender related stereotypes. \n6 \n \ninherence implies a lack of choice, and that choice (and the culpability it connotes) is often a \nmajor component in the stigma attached to certain social categories.2 The authors conclude that \nthe relationship between essentialist beliefs and prejudice may not be as straightforward as early \ntheorists proposed, and that the role of these types of beliefs “may vary as a function of self-\ncategorization and social context” (Haslam et al., 2002, p. 98). \nThese inconsistencies in the relationships between various facets of essentialism and \nattitudes toward gay men and lesbians have been borne out by other researchers. Whereas the \nlink between positive attitudes toward gays and a belief that sexual orientation has biological \nroots or is otherwise immutable has been replicated with relative consistency (see e.g. Hegarty & \nPratto, 2001; Hegarty, 2002; Haslam & Levy, 2006; Jayaratne et al., 2006), other aspects of \nessentialism have more complicated relationships to attitudes. For instance, Hegarty and Pratto \n(2001) identified a ‘fundamentality’ dimension to essentialist beliefs, which they found to be \nnegatively correlated with ‘immutability’ beliefs, and negatively related to attitudes toward gay \nmen and lesbians.  \nSimilarly, Haslam and Levy (2006) found that essentialist beliefs classified under the \nlabel ‘discreteness’ predicted negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and that these \nbeliefs mediated the relationship between participant sex and attitudes toward gay men \n(specifically men’s greater negativity toward gay men), while a newly-defined ‘universality’ \nfactor positively predicted attitudes toward gays, and endorsement of these beliefs mediated the \nrelationship between race and attitudes (specifically, white participants’ greater positivity toward \ngays) as well as the negative relationship between attitudes and religiosity.  \n                                                 \n2 But see Demoulin, Leyens, and Yzerbyt (2006) who demonstrate that endorsement of the type of essentialist belief \ncaptured by the ‘inherence’ item is independent of whether the a group is generally considered to be a forced \nsocial category (FSC) or chosen social category (CSC), and argue that inherence beliefs should actually be \nconstrued as a separate (and more direct) measure of essentialism. \n7 \n \nFinally, Hegarty (2002) challenges the idea that immutability beliefs genuinely \ncorrespond with more positive attitudes toward gays by demonstrating that this link is actually \ndependent on the cultural construction that such beliefs are an expression of tolerance. In his \nstudy, he replicated the correlation between immutability beliefs and attitudes in an American \nsample, but showed that the correlation was absent in a British sample. Even more tellingly, he \ndemonstrated that in both cultures the correlation between immutability beliefs and attitudes was \ndependent on participants perceiving that gay-tolerant (rather than condemning) people were the \nones most likely to agree with the immutability items. Thus, Hegarty argued, “people may be \nconstructing their beliefs about brain nuclei, genes and hormones to fit their sexual politics rather \nthan the reverse” (p. 163).  \nOverall, there is very little consistency in the literature regarding the relationship between \nso-called essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay men and \nlesbians. This calls into question the idea that ‘essentialism’ is even a meaningful term under \nwhich to categorize the various belief statements that have traditionally made up this composite \nin reference to other groups, once these statements are translated into the sexual orientation \ncontext. Finally, this suggests that a new approach is needed in order to more fully understand \nhow essentialist ideology (in general) may interact with anti-gay prejudice. \nEssentialist Beliefs as Motivated Cognitions \nExtending this logic somewhat further, Verkuyten (2003) suggested that it may be useful \nto reconceptualize essentialism as a social practice rather than an internal psychological process \nor set of beliefs. This practice, they assert, can be deployed oppressively or progressively, \ndepending on the particular context and the way in which it is performed. For instance, \nessentialist rhetoric can be useful to minority groups attempting to defend against unrealistic \n8 \n \nassimilationist demands, and seeking to gain institutional acknowledgment of their cultural \npractices. On the other hand, de-essentializing language is crucial for defending against the \nnegative stereotypes and stigma that are often attached to minority groups by the majority, as \nwell as for guarding against attempts at discrimination or segregation. \nCastano, Sacchi, and Gries (2003) demonstrate an analogous point in their experimental \nstudy manipulating the perceived entitativity of the European Union (EU). They found that \nentitativity had a polarizing effect on perceptions of the EU’s actions between people who had \ngenerally positive or generally negative attitudes of the EU. Thus, it was not the case that \nperceived entitativity directly influenced judgments for good or ill, but rather that this perception \nheightened the attitude pattern that already existed. Analogously, participants were more \npersuaded by a research article purporting to have discovered important sex differences in \ncognition when the interpretation of the findings was affirming to their own gender (Morton, \nHaslam, Postmes, & Ryan, 2006). This pattern was enhanced when the type of research \ndescribed was based on neuroscience (which arguably enhanced the essentializing thrust of the \nfindings) compared to when it involved more mundane social psychology research methods (in-\ndepth interviews and surveys). \nAdding further complexity to an already complicated picture of the motivations behind \nendorsement of essentialist beliefs is the role of perceived system stability. Morton, Postmes, \nHaslam, and Hornsey (2009) manipulated perceptions of the gender hierarchy via fake news \narticles that either depicted the hierarchy as unstable (with women making gains), stable (with \nmen on top) or already changed (with women now holding higher status than men). They found \nthat sexist men were more supportive of essentializing research related to gender differences \nwhen the hierarchy was depicted as changing than when it was depicted as stable or already \n9 \n \nchanged. Consistent with the overarching themes from the work of Yzerbyt and colleagues \ndiscussed above, this implies a perception that essentializing gender difference can be a tool to \nprotect the status quo when it is under threat.  \nFurther demonstrating the effectiveness of essentialism as a defensive and system-\nlegitimizing tool, the authors’ third study showed that when participants were exposed to an \naccount of gender differences that attributed the variation entirely to evolved biological drives \n(versus an account that also included evidence challenging the importance of biology in creating \ndifferences), men were more likely to view the current system of gender treatment as fair and \nendorse the use of discriminatory practices against women. More striking, both men and women \nin the sample were more accepting of social dominance ideology in general, and were less likely \nto think that social change was likely, when exposed to the purely biological account. \nThe authors posit that essentialist beliefs should not be thought of merely as internal \nphilosophies that people hold ‘in and of themselves’, but rather as tactical arguments to be \nemployed selectively when a system is under threat. The link between essentialism and \nprejudice, therefore, is not one-to-one, but has to be considered in the context of who is \nessentializing whom, and for what purpose. That is, essentialism is employed strategically by \ngroups “to argue for or against particular visions of intergroup relations” (Morton et al., 2009, p. \n663). It is for this reason that I suggest gender essentialism may provide a useful avenue for \nunderstanding attitudes toward gay men and lesbians – and perhaps to a greater extent than \nessentialist ideas about sexual orientation. As I will describe in greater detail below, the \nmotivations behind gender essentialism (to preserve the status quo with regard to gender roles) \nare undermined by same-sex relationships, which could presumably open the door for anti-gay \nattitudes, whereas it is unclear what motivations essentialist beliefs about sexual orientation \n10 \n \nserve, or that these motivations are consistent enough across the different sub-domains of \nessentialism to even be properly categorized under a unified moniker.  \nGender Inversion Theory and Symbolic Beliefs \nA great deal of research has exposed the tendency to treat gender as a discrete category \nand to punish those men and women who blur the lines. In three studies, Costrich, Feinstein, \nKidder, Maracek, & Pascale (1975) demonstrated how gender role violators are punished in third \nparty evaluations. They also found that men were more consistent punishers, and more \nconsistently punished (specifically, women were less consistently punishing of norm violating \nwomen, Costrich et al., 1975). The tendency to view gender as a bipolar and unidimensional \nconstruct is theoretically entangled with the implicit inversion theory. This theory hinges on the \nidea that masculine and feminine roles and identity are categorical opposites sharing a one-to-\none relationship with biological sex and sexual orientation. Under this script, men must be \nmasculine and sexually prefer women, whereas women must be feminine and sexually prefer \nmen. If an individual violates one part of this script, an implicit inversion is imputed, and people \nassume consistent violation to other parts of the script (McCreary, 1994). Thus, people who \nviolate gender norms are assumed to be homosexual (Deaux and Lewis, 1984, McCreary, 1994), \nand homosexuals are assumed to have traits that are more like opposite-sex than same-sex \nheterosexuals (Kite & Deaux, 1987).  \nThis implicit connection seems to be stronger for gay men than for lesbians. There was \nsome ambivalence among participants in Kite and Deaux’s study about the link between sexual \norientation and gender performance for women – specifically, men in the study showed a strong \ncorrelation between the characteristics assigned to lesbians and to heterosexual males, whereas \nwomen in the study did not. Overall, gay men and straight men were viewed as more dissimilar \n11 \n \nthan lesbians and straight women. In McCreary’s (1994) study, a male target described with \nstereotypical feminine characteristics was judged more likely to be homosexual than a cross-\ngender acting female target. Consistent with these findings, Madon (1997) undertook a \npainstaking examination of the stereotype content related to gay men and found two over-arching \nthemes: 1) belief that gay men exhibit positive feminine-typed qualities (e.g., warm hearted, \ncompassionate, open about feelings); 2) belief that gay men violate acceptable norms for male \nbehavior (e.g., walk like girls, transvestites, limp wristed). The latter of these two sub-types was \nmore dominant. Furthermore, previous research has shown that negative attitudes toward gay \nmen and lesbians stem in part from the perception of these individuals as gender role violators \n(MacDonald & Games, 1974; Laner & Laner, 1979, 1980). \nProbably the single most consistent and robust predictor of attitudes toward gay men and \nlesbians, however, is endorsement of authoritarian beliefs – often called Right Wing \nAuthoritarianism, or RWA (Altemeyer, 1981). In my 2012 meta-analysis, I found a staggeringly \nhigh summary correlation between authoritarianism and heterosexism (?? = .62) with evidence \nthat the relationship is even growing stronger over time.3 Broadly defined, authoritarianism is a \nbelief system that promotes order and social cohesion by adherence to legitimate authorities and \ndenigration of individuals who disrupt the status quo. Haddock, Zanna, and Esses (1993) show \nevidence that the relationship between RWA and heterosexism may be driven by a specific set of \nsymbolic beliefs (which they define as “beliefs that social groups violate or promote the \nattainment of cherished values, customs, and traditions,” Haddock et al., 1993, p. 1106) as well \nas perceived value discrepancy (a perception that a group endorses values that differ from one’s \nown). The authors assessed participants’ symbolic beliefs about gays in two separate studies, and \n                                                 \n3 Notably, the next highest summary correlation observed in my meta-analysis was with gender attitudes: ?? = .44. \n12 \n \nin both cases beliefs that gays violate traditional family values were among the most common. \nWhile the authors did not give detail about participants’ specific responses to the symbolic \nbeliefs and value discrepancies items, there is reason to suspect that investment in the gender \nbinary may have been entangled with the concept that they labeled ‘traditional family values’.  \nEvidence from a 2007 meta-analysis by Sibley, Wilson, and Duckitt of the robust \nrelationship between Right Wing Authoritarianism and endorsement of Benevolent Sexism \nprovides tangential support for this theory. The authors explain that while RWA is not directly \nrelated to a desire to subjugate women, it corresponds with a belief that men and women fulfill \ncomplementary (if unequal) roles within society. The relationship between RWA and BS, \ntherefore, is the result of a motivational process in which people who are high in RWA seek to \n“maintain the cohesion of the ingroup and establish clear boundaries for the prescriptive roles \nthat men and women play within the contexts of the ingroup” (Sibley, Wilson, and Duckitt, \n2007, p. 163). Prejudice is to be expected, therefore, toward groups that threaten this cohesion \nand undermine these consensual ideologies. Brandt and Henry (2012) take this logic one step \nfurther, and assert that the psychologically protective function of RWA might be particularly \nalluring for women in individualist societies with high levels of gender inequality. The authors \nfound that within those societies, not only were women more endorsing of authoritarian values \nthan men, but that the degree of their endorsement was correlated with the degree of stigma \nagainst women. Conversely, in more egalitarian individualist societies, men endorsed RWA \nmore than women did. \nReturning to the results of Haddock et al. (1993), the authors discovered that for \nparticipants high in RWA, symbolic beliefs were more highly predictive of attitudes toward gay \nmen and lesbians than either affective responses or endorsement of negative stereotypes. They \n13 \n \nexplain that not only do people high in RWA tend to hold more traditional values, but they also \nassign these values more importance in their daily lives (Haddock et al., 1993, referencing prior \nwork). Interestingly, the correlation between RWA and heterosexism became small and non-\nsignificant after partialling out the variance attributable to symbolic beliefs and perceived value \ndissimilarity (strength of correlation reduced from .40 to .11). \nFurther, the authors demonstrated that not only was RWA (mediated by symbolic beliefs) \npredictive of more negative attitudes toward gays, but that this particular formula of attitude \nformation may lead to greater consequences for gay rights. Among participants who all held \nequally negative views toward gays, those who were high in RWA advocated a greater funding \nreduction for a gay rights group than participants low in RWA (45% compared to 25%). The \nauthors also found that it was those participants whose negative attitudes were driven by their \nnegative symbolic beliefs who advocated the greatest funding reduction (52%). Thus, greater \nunderstanding of the symbolic beliefs that undergird the relationship between RWA and \nheterosexism could be quite instrumental in helping to develop prejudice reduction strategies and \navert future discrimination against gays and lesbians. \nSummary \nPrevious research suggests that essentialist beliefs related to gender are more pervasive \nthan those pertaining to any other social category, and gender is perceived (to a greater extent \nthan other categories) to be a ‘natural kind’ rather than an artifact. When categories are perceived \nas natural, then differences between groups are ‘inferred to be fundamentally and even morally \ncorrect’ (Haslam, 2011, p. 819). Furthermore, essentialist beliefs lead people to view groups as \nnecessarily distinct and different from one another, while each group’s members remain \nfundamentally similar to each other. Because homosexuality both constitutes a per se gender role \n14 \n \nviolation regarding sexual object choice, and implies a host of other gender role violations via \nimplicit inversion theory, it poses a problem for the maintenance of gender as a natural and \ndiscrete category, fueling negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Considering the \nevidence that essentialist beliefs about a category become stronger when the status hierarchy \nwithin that category is under threat, it is possible that this attitudinal chain is strengthened by the \nrecent focus on women’s increasing equality in the workplace, and the fabled decline of the \ntraditionally masculine man.  \nEssentialist beliefs about gender, deployed to protect the status quo, are challenged by the \nexistence and increasing visibility of gay men and lesbians, and the gender flexibility they \nexhibit, imply, or with which society stereotypically imbues them. For these reasons, one could \nexpect a direct and consistent relationship between essentialist gender beliefs and heterosexism, \nwhereas the relationship of heterosexism with essentialist beliefs about sexual orientation has \nbeen inconsistent in strength and direction, fractured among the various facets of essentialism, \neven splintering those sub-domains of essentialist thinking that previous research has identified \nas hanging together. In drawing this connection, however, it will be important to distinguish \ngender essentialism from the more general endorsement of traditional gender role norms, and to \ndemonstrate that gender essentialism can contribute to the prediction of heterosexist attitudes \nbeyond just being a proxy for gender role ideology. Further, it will be worthwhile to specifically \ntest the proposed justification for why gender essentialism influences attitudes toward gays – that \nis, the symbolic belief that gays threaten gender-related values should mediate this relationship. \nA relationship between gender essentialism and heterosexism may help to explain why \nstudies frequently (though not universally) find that men have more negative attitudes toward \ngays, and in particular toward gay men. If the gender hierarchy is under threat, it is reasonable \n15 \n \nthat men should be more motivated and invested in its preservation. Indeed, research has found \nthat men are more likely to endorse essentialist beliefs about gender, and are more consistent in \npunishing gender role violators. The fact that attitudes toward gay men tend to be more negative \nthan attitudes toward lesbians is consistent also with the greater stringency in gender role norms \nfor men and the greater perceived link between sexual orientation and gender identity for gay \nmen than for lesbians. Based on this, we may expect essentialist beliefs about gender and \nsymbolic beliefs that gays threaten gender related values to mediate the sex difference in \nattitudes toward gays. Finally, symbolic beliefs related to ‘traditional family values’ have already \nbeen found to mediate the heterosexism-predicting effect of Right Wing Authoritarianism (the \nsingle most robust and consistent predictor of attitudes toward gays yet to be observed). \nConsidering that ‘family values’ are likely to be fundamentally tied up with traditional notions of \ngender, gender essentialism and more broadly construed symbolic beliefs about gays’ effect on \ngender issues might do so as well.  \nResearch examining the role of gender attitudes on heterosexism has not yet explored the \nrole of essentialism, and research examining the influence of essentialist beliefs on group-related \nattitudes has not yet tested a cross-domain relationship. In addition to demonstrating this \nrelationship, a further goal of this project will be to provide support for the specific causal chain \nimplied by the theory described above, by experimentally influencing the salience of gender \nessentialist beliefs. By testing if the effect is manipulable, it will illuminate a possible avenue for \ninterventions to reduce anti-gay prejudice.  \n16 \n \n \n \nStudy One \nPurpose and Hypotheses \nThe primary goal of the first study was to explore the relative strength of relationships \nbetween gender essentialism, endorsement of gender role norms, beliefs about sexual orientation \n(including symbolic beliefs and essentialist beliefs), and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. I \nexpected that gender essentialism would be positively related to the endorsement of gender role \nnorms, and that together these variables would account for a significant proportion of variance in \nattitudes toward gay men and lesbians, but was particularly interested in what gender \nessentialism could contribute in addition to or in combination with the influence of gender role \nnorms (Hypothesis 1). Second, I predicted that gender essentialism would uniformly predict \nattitudes toward gay men and lesbians, whereas essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation \nwould not be so consistent or reliable (Hypothesis 2).  \nThird, I predicted that the relationship between gender essentialism and attitudes toward \ngays would be mediated by symbolic beliefs that gay men and lesbians threaten gender-related \nvalues (Hypothesis 3), acknowledging the possibility that this pattern might only emerge \namongst those participants whose beliefs about gays were heavily influenced by the implicit \ninversion theory. Finally, I proposed that gender essentialism and symbolic beliefs about gays’ \ninfluence on values related to gender could account for a substantial portion of the influence \ntypically attributed to two of the most commonly observed predictors of heterosexism: \nparticipant sex and Right Wing Authoritarianism (Hypothesis 4).  \n \n17 \n \nMethod \nParticipants. Two hundred twenty-three participants were recruited from M-Turk4 (110 \nmale, 112 female, and 1 who did not report sex). The median age of the sample was 30, and \nparticipants self-identified as (non-Hispanic) White / European American (79.4%), Black / \nAfrican American / Caribbean (4.9%), Hispanic / Latino(a) (4.9%), Asian / Pacific Islander \n(7.6%), and Other (3.1%). Ninety-two percent of the sample identified as exclusively or \npredominantly heterosexual.5  \nMaterials and procedure. Participants completed each of the scales described below via \na survey linked through Qualtrics. Except where noted, each scale was presented on a separate \npage. In order to minimize the potential for systematic effects of exposure to any one scale’s \ncontent on responses to another scale, the order of presentation was randomized. All participants \nviewed the consent statement first and completed demographic information last, however. Each \nof these scales can be found in their entirety in Appendix A. The scale titles are for reference \nonly, and were not included in the materials presented to participants. \nEssentialist beliefs related to gender and sexual orientation. These items were adapted \nbased on prior work by Haslam, Rothschild, and Ernst (2002), Haslam and Levy (2006), as well \nas Hegarty and Pratto (2001), in order to efficiently cover the sub-domains of essentialist \nthinking which have been most fruitful in prior work, and are most likely to be relevant to the \n                                                 \n4 Twelve of these participants completed the survey twice, thus my initial dataset contained 235 cases. Only the data \nfrom their first survey attempt were retained, however, yielding the N of 223 reported above.  \n5 In both of my studies I elected not to exclude participants on the basis of sexual orientation. From a statistical \nperspective, this was done to preserve maximum power for the analyses and because sexual orientation did not \nindependently predict heterosexist attitudes in either study. From a theoretical perspective this was done because \nrestrictive attitudes about gender are influential within the LGBT community as well as without, and while it \nshould be expected that this group would exhibit less heterosexism and possibly be less endorsing of gender \nessentialism overall, this section of the sample still represents a meaningful segment along the spectrum of these \nattitudes and their interaction, thus I felt it would be both desirable and appropriate to capture these perspectives in \nmy data. I did, however, retest each of the analyses described below excluding participants indicating a sexual \norientation of 4 or higher (indicating bisexuality or homosexuality) and all significant effects remained significant.  \n18 \n \ncurrent examination: discreteness, immutability, uniformity, informativeness, and universality. \nThese sub-domains include two which fall under Haslam et al.’s (2002) original ‘naturalness’ \ndomain (discreteness and immutability), and two falling under the original ‘entitativity’ domain \n(uniformity and informativeness), adding the ‘universality’ component which was later identified \nas important by Haslam and Levy (2006) as a predictor of more positive attitudes toward gays \n(compared with the negative predictive power of ‘discreteness’). Note that while Hegarty and \nPratto (2001) arrived at an entirely different typology for essentialist beliefs about sexual \norientation (extracting an ‘Immutability’ factor and a ‘Fundamentality’ factor), the items selected \nfor the current project are poised to capture these opposing dimensions as well: informativeness, \ndiscreteness, and universality items all contributed to the Fundamentality factor in Hegarty and \nPratto’s analysis (though the loading for universality was negative).  \nAlthough the items related to gender were administered on a separate page from the items \nrelated to sexual orientation, and the order of these scales was randomized, the items for each \nscale were worded somewhat differently, in order to reduce the likelihood of response \ncontamination on whichever scale was completed second. Also, note that for the gender \nessentialism items, beliefs related to gender, not sex, are of interest. That is, most people quite \nlikely view biological sex as a discrete and immutable category, without this belief interacting \nwith gender role expectations and influencing attitudes toward norm violators. What is more \nrelevant to the current project is the idea that gender is a binary rather than a continuum, that \nmasculinity and femininity are immutable, and naturally follow from one’s biological sex, and so \non.  \nThe five gender essentialism items were averaged to form the Gender Essentialist Beliefs \ncomposite (GEB, α = .76). Higher scores on this composite mean greater endorsement of \n19 \n \nessentialist beliefs regarding gender. A five-item composite for Sexual Orientation Essentialism \n(SOE) was created in the same fashion, but because of the incredibly low reliability (α = .24), an \nExploratory Factor Analysis was conducted (using principal axis factoring and Oblimin rotation, \nallowing extracted factors to correlate) to determine whether the items should be treated as a \nunified composite, or if they would more accurately be characterized by two or more factors. \nResults suggested a two-factor solution, with items 1 (immutability) and 5 (universality) loading \non the second factor, and the remaining three items (informativeness, uniformity, discreteness) \nloading on the first.6 Importantly, this division among the items also reflects a division in their \nrelationship to Heterosexist Attitudes (see below for further description of that scale). While \nthose SOE items that loaded on Factor 1 are all significantly related to greater levels of \nheterosexism (rs between .24 and .47, ps < .001), the remaining two items correspond to more \npositive attitudes toward gays, thus negatively predicting heterosexism (rs = -.39 and -.46, ps < \n.001). I therefore created two additional composites: SOEPos (items 2, 3, and 4, α = .58) and \nSOENeg (items 1 and 5, α = .41). \nEndorsement of gender role norms. Three items were selected from the Gender Role \nBeliefs Scale (Kerr & Holden, 1996), and three items were selected from the Sex-Role \nOrientation Scale (Brogan & Kutner, 1976). These scales were selected primarily due to their \ncontent relevance, but secondarily due to their demonstrated association with attitudes toward \ngay men and lesbians. The particular items within the scales were chosen in order to include (in a \nvery limited number of items) perceptions of masculine norms, feminine norms, and norms \nregarding male/female interaction, with an eye toward avoiding items that used outdated \n                                                 \n6 By contrast, the same analysis when performed on the GEB items resulted in extraction of a single factor \naccounting for over 50% of the variance (Eigenvalue = 2.53, with potential remaining factors exhibiting \nEigenvalues of .81 or below). All five items were positively related to this dominant factor, with loadings ranging \nfrom .51 to .70. \n20 \n \nlanguage or expressed ideas that modern participants would be unlikely to endorse. Changes in \nwording were made to two of the items, so that each dimension would have one positively \nworded and one reverse-coded item. For the survey administration, these items were mixed in \nwith the GEB items on a page labeled “General beliefs about gender”. Responses to these items \nwere averaged, reverse-coding where necessary, to form the Gender Role Norms composite \n(GRN, α = .71). Higher scores on this composite indicate greater support for traditional gender \nrole norms. \nSymbolic beliefs. I generated this scale based on information from Haddock, Zanna, and \nEsses (1993) to serve as a direct measure of the degree to which participants view gays and \nlesbians as threatening the gender dichotomy. In order to reduce potential for demand \ncharacteristics, filler domains were included to reduce the focus on gender within this scale, but \nof particular interest were responses to item #2 (family happiness), item #5 (harmony between \nthe sexes), and item #9 (positive gender development). To determine whether the items of \ninterest formed a meaningful cluster as expected, a series of exploratory factor analyses were \nperformed, using principal axis factoring. The simplest factor structure was achieved when three \nfactors were extracted and the factors were permitted to correlate with one another (Oblimin \nrotation). This solution yielded minimal cross-loading (only one item produced a loading above \n.30 on more than one factor) and all but one item showed a strong loading on a single factor \n(loadings = .52 and greater). The three items of interest all loaded on the first factor, along with \ntwo additional items (health and public safety, and meritocracy). No theoretical justification is \napparent for why these two filler items should be conceptually related to the other three, and \nreliability analyses confirmed that among the five items, the two fillers showed the lowest item-\ntotal correlations. I therefore proceeded to create the initially intended Symbolic Beliefs \n21 \n \ncomposite (SB, α = .80). Higher scores on this composite indicate more positive symbolic \nbeliefs about gays (that is, that they contribute positively to, rather than threaten, values related to \ngender and the family). \nEndorsement of the Implicit Inversion Theory. I generated these items based on \ninformation from Kite and Deaux (1987) to construct a face-valid measure of the belief that gay \nmen and lesbians more closely resemble opposite sex heterosexuals than their same-sex \nheterosexual counterparts, and the endorsement of stereotypes about gays and lesbians that are \npredicated on gender-based assumptions. For the survey administration, these items were mixed \nin with the SOE items on a page labeled “General beliefs about gays and lesbians”. Responses to \nthese items were averaged to form an overall Implicit Inversion Theory composite (IIT, α = .82). \nAttitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The items within this scale come from a variety \nof sources, and were selected in order to efficiently capture attitudes toward gays along five main \nfacets: Affective; Aversive; Equality; Heteronormativity; and Perceived Threat. In my own \nresearch (Hettinger and Seybert, forthcoming) this scale has demonstrated high internal \nreliability (alphas ranging from .96 to .98) as well as concurrent and criterion related validity.  \nSpecifically, this scale has demonstrated very high correlations (rs ranging from .91 to \n.96) with Herek’s (1984) 20-item Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men scale, which is one of \nthe most frequently used scales within this area of research. It has also shown robust correlations \nwith the conceptually related Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (Glick and Fiske, 1996, r = .48) and \nRight Wing Authoritarianism scale (Zakrisson, 2005, r = .72), both of which very slightly \nexceeded the correlations of these measures with Herek’s scale (rs = .46 and .69, respectively). \nFinally, in a lab study, scores on this scale (administered separately as a part of mass testing) \nsignificantly predicted participants’ evaluations and hiring recommendations for job candidate \n22 \n \nwho was presented and recognized as gay. When presented with two candidates (one depicted as \nbeing in heterosexual marriage, and the other living with a same-sex partner), participants \nscoring higher on the 5-category Heterosexism Scale gave the gay candidate lower ratings (β = -\n.23, t(109) = -2.51, p = .01), and were less likely to recommend hiring or giving a second \ninterview to the gay candidate (β = -.27, t(109) = -2.89, p < .01).7 In the current sample the scale \nonce again showed exceptionally high reliability, and the items were averaged (reverse-coding \nwhere necessary) to form the Heterosexist Attitudes composite (HA, α =.98). Higher scores on \nthis composite indicate greater levels of heterosexism. \nRight Wing Authoritarianism. The items selected from this scale were derived from \nZakrisson’s (2005) version of the scale. This version was selected due to its enhanced brevity \nand reliability, as well for its more general conceptualization of the authoritarian concept; many \nRWA scales include items that specifically reference stigmatized groups, creating some \nambiguity as to whether it is truly authoritarianism or merely the preponderance of these items \nthat leads to correlations with prejudice. Five of the fifteen items were eliminated in order to \nfurther maximize these goals (one item was eliminated for lack of clarity, and four were \neliminated for their reference to religion and/or sexual conduct). The remaining items were \nedited where necessary for grammatical purposes. These items were averaged, reverse-coding \nwhere appropriate, to create the Right Wing Authoritarianism composite (RWA, α = .86). Higher \nscores on this scale indicate more authoritarian attitudes. \nDemographic items. Participant sex, age, race, sexual orientation, strength of religious \naffiliation / fundamentalism, and political orientation were also assessed as part of a \n                                                 \n7 Running these regressions with Herek’s scale as the predictor instead yielded similar, if slightly weaker, effects: \nfor ratings, β = -.19, t(109) = -2.05, p = .04; for recommendations, β = -.26, t(109) = -2.76, p < .01). \n23 \n \ndemographic questionnaire. For specific wording of the questions, see Appendix A. For the \npurpose of statistical analyses, participant sex (Sex) was dummy-coded 0 for female and 1 for \nmale. Based on previous research which has consistently indicated more positive attitudes on the \npart of White respondents compared to other races, and more negative attitudes on the part of \nBlack respondents compared to other races, Race in this study was divided into two dummy \ncodes, the first reflecting identification as White (0 = non-White, 1 = White) and the second \nreflecting identification as Black (0 = non-Black, 1 = Black). Thus, White participants were \nidentified by the codes 1, 0, Black participants were identified as 0, 1, and all other participants \nreceived the codes 0, 0. The items pertaining to religion were Z-transformed prior to being \ncombined to form the religiosity composite (Religiosity, α = .87). The three items pertaining to \npolitical ideology were averaged to form the Political Orientation composite (PO, α = .90). \nResults \nAs a preliminary matter, a regression analysis was conducted to determine which \ndemographic variables were substantially related to Heterosexist Attitudes (HA) and therefore \nshould be included as potential covariates. HA was regressed onto Sex, the two race codes \n(White; Black), Age, Sexual Orientation, Religiosity, and Political Orientation (PO). The full \nresults of this analysis can be found in Table 1.8 Sex, Age, Religiosity, PO, and identifying as \nBlack all significantly predicted HA. The failure of Sexual Orientation to emerge as a significant \npredictor is somewhat surprising, but (given the relative lack of non-heterosexual participants in \nthe sample) should not be over-interpreted. Unless otherwise noted, the five variables to emerge \nas independently significant predictors were treated as control variables in the subsequent \n                                                 \n8 Because many of the variables involved in this project have known relationships with one another, collinearity \ndiagnostics were requested for each regression analysis performed. Examination of Condition Indices, Tolerance \nand Variance Inflation Factors indicated that collinearity was within acceptable margins.  \n24 \n \nanalyses.9 This reduced the total number of participants included in the analyses to 220, because \nthree participants were missing data for one or more of these demographic variables. \nHypothesis 1a: Essentialist beliefs related to gender (GEB) will be positively related to \nendorsement of traditional gender role norms (GRN) as well as heterosexist attitudes (HA).  \nTo test this hypothesis, a partial correlation analysis was conducted, examining the \ninterrelationships among these variables both with and without the covariates listed above. In \nboth cases, the relationships with GEB were significant (GEB / GRN: r = .58, p < .001; rp = .45, \np < .001; GEB / HA: r = .54, p < .001; rp = .30, p < .001). \nHypothesis 1b: GEB and GRN will both positively predict HA (independently and/or \ninteractively), such that people who score highly on both of these scales will exhibit the greatest \nlevels of HA.  \nBefore proceeding to the next analysis, centered versions of the composites were created \n(to reduce potential issues of collinearity), and an interaction term was computed by multiplying \nthese centered predictors. HA was regressed first onto the covariates mentioned above, and (in a \nsecond step) onto GEBC, GRNC, and their interaction. Full results of this analysis can be found in \nTable 2, but both steps produced significant changes in R2. While GEB only marginally predicted \nHA in this model (p = .06), GRN and the interaction term were both highly significant predictors \n(ps < .001). Simple slopes analyses revealed that the effect of GEB was significant (p < .001) \nwhen GRN was high (+1 SD), but not when GRN was low (-1 SD, p = .36). Similarly, the effect \nof GRN was significant when GEB was high (p < .001), but was reduced to marginal \n                                                 \n9 To ensure that the observed results were not merely a product of suppression effects, these same analyses were also \nperformed with the covariates omitted. All significant effects remained significant. The main effect of GEB \n(Hypothesis 1b) and the main effect of SOE (Hypothesis 2) moved from marginally significant to significant when \nthe covariates were omitted. The direction of these effects was unchanged. \n25 \n \nsignificance when GEB was low (p = .06). Thus, the two constructs appear to work in tandem, \neach amplifying the effect of the other. Figure 1 shows the pattern of results.  \nHypothesis 2: GEB will be a stronger and more consistent predictor of HA than will a \ncomposite of essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation (SOE).  \nAs in the previous analysis, HA was first regressed onto the covariates, while GEB and \nSOE (total) were entered on the second step. Both steps resulted in significant changes to R2, and \nthe full model revealed the anticipated result: while GEB emerged as a highly significant positive \npredictor (p < .001), SOE emerged as a marginally significant negative predictor (p = .07, see \nTable 3 for full results). A dominance analysis (Azen & Budescu, 2003) confirmed that \napproximately 93% of the extra variance in HA explained by the second step of the model (∆R2 \n= .05) was attributable to GEB, whereas SOE contributed only 7%.  \nExamining the sub-divided SOE composite, however, yielded a different picture. \nRegressing HA on GEB, SOEPos, and SOENeg revealed that GEB was once again a significant \npositive predictor (p = .01). SOEPos also emerged as a positive predictor (p = .02), while \nSOENeg was a robust negative predictor (p < .001) of HA (see Table 4). A subsequent \ndominance analysis showed that 56% of the extra variance accounted for by the addition of these \npredictors to the model (∆R2 = .13) was attributable to SOENeg, while 22% was explained by \nGEB and 21% by SOEPos. For completeness, a third dominance analysis was conducted with \nGEB and SOEPos alone, revealing that 51% of the extra variance accounted for by a model \nincluding only those predictors on Step 2 (∆R2 = .06) was carried by GEB, while 49% was \ncarried by SOEPos.10  \n                                                 \n10 I continued to treat GEB as a 5-item composite in this analysis because each of the GEB items was correlated to \nHA in the same direction and with comparable strength, however results are similar (if not slightly more favorable \ntoward GEB) when a reduced composite mirroring that of SOEPos was used. This analysis, including a composite \n26 \n \nHypothesis 3: The relationship between GEB and HA will be mediated by endorsement of \nsymbolic beliefs (SB) that gay men and lesbians threaten important values related to gender.  \nFor this and subsequent mediation models, I used Preacher and Hayes’ (2004) \nbootstrapping method.  This method provides a non-parametric test of mediation that does not \ndepend on assumptions of normality. In this model, Symbolic Beliefs (SB) were examined as a \npotential mediator of the relationship between GEB and HA, while Sex, Age, Religiosity, PO, \nand identifying as Black were entered as covariates. Standard errors and confidence intervals \nwere estimated from 5,000 bootstrap samples created using random sampling with replacement.  \nWhen the 95% confidence interval for an indirect effect does not contain zero, the indirect effect \nis significant at p < .05. Results indicated significant partial mediation (see Table 5). Higher \nGEB predicted more negative symbolic beliefs (p = .02), SB in turn was significantly related to \nHA (p < .001), and significantly mediated the relationship between GEB and HA, though the \ndirect effect remained significant. Sex, Religiosity, and PO also significantly influenced HA. \nHypothesis 4: The predictive influence of participant sex (Sex) and of Right Wing \nAuthoritarianism (RWA) on HA can be partially explained by GEB and/or SB.  \nTo test this hypothesis, I performed two additional bootstrapping analyses, one with Sex \nas the independent variable, and one with RWA as the independent variable. In both analyses, \nHA was the dependent variable and GEB and SB were both entered as potential mediators. \nBecause I was not interested in demonstrating the independent predictive influence of Sex or \nRWA on HA per se, but rather with the potential for GEB and SB to account for variance that is \ntypically attributed to Sex and RWA, no covariates were included in these models. For the first \nanalysis, GEB (but not SB) emerged as a significant mediator of the relationship between Sex \n                                                                                                                                                             \nmade from GEB items 2-4 (α = .64) revealed that gender essentialism accounted for 54% of the extra variance \n(∆R2 again = .06, after covariates were accounted for) while sexual orientation essentialism accounted for 46%. \n27 \n \nand HA. That is, men more highly endorsed essentialist beliefs about gender (p < .01), GEB \npredicted greater heterosexism (p < .001), and although the relationship between Sex and HA \nremained significant with the mediators in the model (p = .04), GEB significantly mediated this \nrelationship (p < .05). Although SB was significantly related to HA (p < .001), Sex was not \nrelated to SB (p = .15), thus this variable was not a significant mediator. Table 6 shows the full \nresults.  \nIn the second analysis, both GEB and SB emerged as significant mediators of the \nrelationship between RWA and HA. Participants’ RWA levels were related to higher GEB (p < \n.001) and more negative SB (p < .001). In turn, both GEB (p < .01) and SB (p < .001) predicted \nHA. While RWA remained a highly significant predictor of HA with the mediators included, \nGEB and SB accounted for a significant portion of this relationship (see Table 7).   \nDiscussion \nResults of this initial exploration were generally consistent with hypotheses. Importantly, \nessentialist beliefs related to gender were reliably and consistently predictive of heterosexist \nattitudes, even after controlling for several influential covariates. Moreover, while there was \nsignificant overlap between gender essentialism and endorsement of traditional gender norms, \nessentialist beliefs were not merely redundant with gender role norm endorsement in predicting \nheterosexism, but rather the two acted to facilitate and amplify one another’s effects.  \nThe relationship of heterosexism with essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation \nwas, as expected, fractured between the immutability and universality items and the remaining \nitems. Treating the items as an undivided composite resulted in a marginally significant negative \npredictor of heterosexist attitudes, accounting for very little variance compared to the positive \npredictive influence of gender essentialism. However, dividing the composite in two revealed \n28 \n \nthat the sexual orientation essentialism items pertaining to discreteness, informativeness, and \nuniformity significantly predicted greater heterosexism at a more or less equal level as the gender \nessentialism composite, though both of these predictors were overshadowed by the strong \nnegative influence of the immutability and universality items. It would appear, therefore, that \nwhile essentialist beliefs about gender may be a better predictor of attitudes toward gays than \nessentialist beliefs relating to sexual orientation on the whole, this is entirely owing to the \ninconsistency in the influence of different sub-domains of essentialism when they are applied to \nthe context of sexual orientation. It may be unproductive, therefore, to think of essentialism as a \nunified construct when it comes to sexual orientation, and considering what was revealed in \nHegarty’s (2002) work, even when treating it as a multidimensional construct, there is reason to \ndoubt the reliability of the link between immutability beliefs and attitudes toward gays and \nlesbians, as this relationship may be dependent on a culturally bound perception that \nimmutability beliefs and tolerance go hand in hand. GEB, by contrast, does appear to be a \nunified construct, both with regard to its internal factor structure and the relationship of each of \nthe items to heterosexism. \nConsistent with my theory as outlined in the introduction, the relationship of gender \nessentialism to heterosexism was mediated by symbolic beliefs about gays – in particular, beliefs \nabout whether gays challenge or contribute positively to gender-related values. That is, it appears \nthat gender essentialist beliefs predict heterosexism in part because those who hold these beliefs \nalso tend to feel that gays pose a threat to societal values involving gender, and this in turn \ncontributes to greater negativity toward gays. These symbolic beliefs also significantly mediated \nthe relationship of authoritarian attitudes with heterosexism, consistent with the findings of \nHaddock et al. (1993). Gender essentialism, meanwhile, was a significant mediator for both \n29 \n \nauthoritarian attitudes and participant sex. Considering that these are two of the most frequently \ncited correlates of heterosexism, these results are particularly exciting, as they help to illuminate \n(albeit partially) the mechanisms behind these effects. \n \nTable 1 \nExamining Influence of Demographic Variables – Study One \n (N = 220; DV = Heterosexist Attitudes) \nVariable B SE β \nIntercept .68 .23  \nSex .23 .10 .12* \nRace (White) -.10 .13 -.04 \nRace (Black) .52 .25 .12* \nAge .01 .004 .11* \nSO -.04 .04 -.06 \nReligiosity .31 .06 .29*** \nPO .27 .04 .40*** \n   R2   .48*** \nNote.  *p < .05; ***p < .001.

There were three primary goals: 1) to minimize jargon and \nmaximize brevity in the materials so as not to jeopardize reader attention / understanding; 2) to \nclearly convey the intended message of each passage – one intending to highlight and maximize \nthe impression of fundamental differences between men and women, and one intending to \nchallenge and minimize the impression of these differences; 3) to enhance believability of the \nmeasures by referencing actual research from the literature surrounding evolutionary mating \npsychology, and by crafting the figures to plausibly resemble those one might encounter in a \nbulletin reporting on scientific research findings. In addition to these goals guiding modifications \nto the measures, a secondary purpose of this pilot was to test the efficacy of the finished \nmaterials in temporarily influencing essentialist beliefs about gender, as measured by responses \nto the GEB items.   \nMethod \nParticipants. A total of 63 participants (29 male, 34 female) were recruited for this study \nvia the USF Psychology Department SONA participant pool. The median age was 20 years old, \nand participants were primarily Caucasian (58.7%) with other participants reporting Hispanic / \nLatino(a) (14.3%), Black / African American / Caribbean (9.5%), Asian / Pacific Islander \n(4.8%), Indian / South Asian (3.2%), Arab / Middle Eastern (1.6%), and Other (7.9%) ethnicities. \n38 \n \nMaterials and procedure. The essentialism manipulation was devised based on \ninformation gleaned from Brescoll and LaFrance (2004) and Morton et al. (2009), in the form of \ntwo different ‘research summaries’ related to gender differences. Consistent with Morton et al., \nthese were not fictional accounts, but rather summaries of actually existing research either \nsupporting or contradicting an essentialist view of gender. Both articles begin by introducing the \nfamiliar evolutionary psychology argument that men and women evolved to differ in their \nmating preferences. The essentialism-enhancing stimulus then presented research supporting this \nclaim, whereas the de-essentializing stimulus instead presented research challenging these claims \nand highlighting the debate in the literature. Following the lead of Castano, Sacchi, and Gries \n(2003), these summaries were accompanied by a graphic that visually depicted the categories of \nmasculinity and femininity as fundamentally overlapping with very limited distinctiveness, or as \nfundamentally distinct with very limited overlap.  \nAltogether, this manipulation tapped into most of the sub-domains of essentialism that \nhave been identified in the literature: discreteness (highlighted by the amount of overlap depicted \nin the graphic), uniformity (highlighted by the spread of each curve in the graphic), \ninformativeness (if gender differences in mating preferences are evolved, then you can predict an \nindividual’s preferences within some margin of error just by knowing his/her gender), \nuniversality and stability (the concept of evolved differences implies that said differences should \nhold across cultures and across time), inherence and immutability (invoking evolution connotes \nan inherent cause for gender differences that should not be particularly amenable to change) and \nfinally necessity, naturalness, and exclusivity (asserting a biologically evolved cause for gender \ndifferences necessitates a one-to-one connection between biological sex and gender). A third \nsummary was also crafted to serve as a control. This summary was similar in length to the other \n39 \n \ntwo, and discussed the claim that the process by which calorie counts are determined for \nnutrition labels tends to overestimate the number of calories that are actually absorbed by the \nbody when food is consumed. This condition was included to serve as a neutral baseline for \nevaluating the effect of the critical stimuli on gender essentialist beliefs.  \nParticipants completed the materials individually in private laboratory rooms. After \ngiving consent to participate, participants first viewed the ‘Research Summary’, and were \ninstructed to open their door once they had finished reading. The investigator then took the \nsummary and gave the participant a questionnaire which first assessed their overall response to \nthe essay, via three items which were selected from a more extensive list included in Morton, \nHaslam, Postmes, and Ryan (2006), and can be found in Appendix B. The questionnaire \ncontinued with the same gender essentialism and gender role norms items as were included in \nStudy 1. These items were included to determine, first, if the manipulation influenced essentialist \nbeliefs in the predicted direction, and second, to determine if this influence held independently of \nany unintentional influence on reported endorsement of gender role norms. The last item of the \nquestionnaire asked participants to select the statement which most closely summarized the \nresearch synopsis they had read. This served as a manipulation check, and particularly to help \ndetermine if it the materials were being properly understood as written. Finally, demographic \nitems assessing participant sex, age, race, sexual orientation, religious fundamentalism, \nidentification, and frequency of church attendance, as well as political orientation were included.  \nAfter participants completed the questionnaire, the researcher debriefed the participants, \nfirst gathering overall impressions regarding the essay, and whether or not participants found the \nsummary convincing, then probing for suspicion that the research summary was not genuine, as \nwell as any difficulty understanding the materials. If the participants indicated any suspicion, \n40 \n \ndifficulty, or other issue with the materials, the researcher solicited advice about how the \nsummary could be improved. None of the participants indicated suspicion that the research \nsummaries were fake, but some did report finding the summaries (as initially written) \nunconvincing, due to the lack of formal citations within the text. At the end of the first week, it \nwas also apparent that the manipulation in the de-essentializing condition was not working \neffectively. Participants were misunderstanding the summary to support the idea of evolved sex \ndifferences rather than challenging them. Based on feedback obtained during debriefing sessions, \nthe materials were modified to try to rectify this issue. The finished versions of the stimulus \nmaterials can be found in Appendix B.  \nResults \nThe result of the modifications was successful, as all of the subsequent pilot participants \npassed the manipulation check for both critical conditions, and ultimately the materials produced \nthe intended effect. After excluding participants who failed the manipulation check (4, all of \nwhom viewed earlier versions of the de-essentializing materials), participants who read the \nessentializing stimulus were significantly more endorsing of the GEB items (M = 2.77, SD, = \n.72) compared to participants who read the de-essentializing stimulus (M = 2.25, SD = .72), t(37) \n= 2.24, p = .03. Comparatively, the difference between conditions for endorsement of the \ntraditional gender role norm items (GRN) fell just short of significance, t(37) = 1.92, p = .06.  \nThe strength of the difference between the critical conditions was amplified after \nexcluding two participants (one from each condition) whose responses to the sexual orientation \nitem on the demographics page indicated that they were not predominantly heterosexual: ME = \n2.85, SD = .64, MD = 2.28, SD = .73, t(35) = 2.55, p < .02. For participants in the control \ncondition, (N = 19 after 1 sexual orientation exclusion), GEB scores fell in between those for the \n41 \n \ncritical conditions (M = 2.69, SD = .73) but did not significantly differ from either (ts = 1.69 or \nlower, ps = .10 or higher). The correlation of GEB and condition (rank ordered: 1 for the de-\nessentializing prime, 2 for the control prime, and 3 for the essentializing prime) was significant \n(r = .33, p < .02) and remained marginally significant after controlling for responses to the GRN \nitems (rp = .25, p = .06). The bivariate correlation between GRN and condition was also \nsignificant (r = .27, p = .05), but became non-significant after controlling for the influence of \nGEB (rp = .17, p = .22). Thus, it seems that both stimuli influenced salience of essentialist beliefs \n(albeit slightly), and in the predicted directions. Based on these results, I felt confident \nproceeding to the main study, using the revised materials (excepting the control stimulus) to \nmanipulate the salience of gender essentialism in my sample.  \n  \n42 \n \n \n \nStudy Two \nPurpose and Hypotheses \nThe purpose of the second study was to lend support to a causal inference about the \nrelationship between gender essentialism and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, by \nmanipulating the salience of essentialist ideas about gender and examining the resulting effect on \nheterosexist attitudes. While essentialist beliefs related to gender are pervasive, this is also an \narea which has been apparently amenable to manipulation in previous research (Brescoll & \nLaFrance, 2004; Morton, Postmes, Haslam, & Hornsey, 2009). Based on this prior research, and \nmy own results from Study One confirming that gender essentialism and heterosexism were \npositively correlated, I predicted that participants exposed to the de-essentializing stimulus \nwould report more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians than participants exposed to \nthe essentializing stimulus (Hypothesis 5). I acknowledged the possibility, however, that this \npattern might be qualified by the perceived persuasiveness of the manipulation, which might in \nturn vary based on demographic variables (e.g. participant sex).  \nMethod \nParticipants. Two hundred twenty-six participants were recruited via SONA (33.2%) \nand MTurk (66.8%).11 The sample included 110 men, 115 women, and one person who \ncompleted only the first two pages of measures, and was therefore not included in any analyses. \nThe median age of the sample was 25, and participants identified as non-Hispanic White / Anglo \nor European American (66.7%), Black / African American / Caribbean (8%), Hispanic / \n                                                 \n11 The samples did not significantly differ with regard to the dependent variable, t(182.50) = .83, p = .41, and sample \nsource did not moderate the relationship between condition and HA described below: F(1, 218) = .37, p = .54). \n43 \n \nLatino(a) (12%), Asian / Pacific Islander (7.1%), Indian / South Asian (.4%), Arab / Middle \nEastern (1.8%) and Other (4%). Just over 91% of participants identified as exclusively or \npredominantly heterosexual. \nMaterials and procedure. The finished versions of the research summaries from the \npilot study were employed here. Participants (who completed the study online, at a time and \nplace of their choosing) were randomly assigned to either read the Essentializing Stimulus (ES) \nor the De-essentializing Stimulus (DS). After reading their assigned summary, participants \ncompleted the same comprehension check and essay evaluation items as were used in the pilot. \nOnce again, these materials can be found in Appendix B. The item assessing perceived bias in \nthe summary was reverse-coded. Because the items were on differently worded scales, they were \nZ-transformed before averaging to form the Essay Evaluation composite (EE, α = .75).12  \nAfter reading and evaluating the stimulus, participants completed the gender essentialist \nbeliefs (GEB, α = .71) and traditional gender role norm endorsement (GRN, α = .61) scales, \nwhich were administered in the same manner as in Study One, together on a page labeled \n‘General Beliefs about Gender’. Next, participants completed the Heterosexist Attitudes scale \n(HA, α = .98). Finally, participants responded to demographic items assessing sex, age, race, \nsexual orientation, strength of religious affiliation, and political orientation. The religiosity items \nassessing identity strength, frequency of religious service attendance, and religious \nfundamentalism (reverse-scored) were first Z-transformed and then averaged to form the \nreligiosity composite (α = .87), and the political orientation items were also averaged to form \ntheir own composite (PO, α = .91). \n                                                 \n12 The means reported below are from the untransformed composite, however, to facilitate interpretability. Results \nof the analysis were the same regardless of which composite was used.  \n44 \n \nResults \nBefore proceeding to test the primary hypothesis, I first compared the two conditions to \nensure that there were no significant demographic differences that might skew the results. The \ntwo conditions did not significantly differ in terms of age, Religiosity, or PO (all ts ≤ .37, all ps ≥ \n.71), and the gender, racial, and sexual orientation compositions of the conditions were very \nsimilar (see Table 8 for full summary). I also tested whether there was a difference in \nparticipants’ evaluations of the two summaries, and found that participants in the ES condition \nrated the summary equally as convincing, unbiased, and significant (M = 3.40, SD = .86) as did \nthe participants in the DS condition (M = 3.45, SD = .78): t(223) = -.45, p = .65. Next I examined \nthe demographic variables to determine which (if any) were significantly related to HA in the \ncurrent study. Age, Religiosity, and PO emerged as significant predictors while sex (dummy \ncoded), race (coded the same way as in Study One) and sexual orientation did not. Full results of \nthis analysis can be found in Table 9.  \nHypothesis 5: Participants exposed to the ES will exhibit higher HA scores than \nparticipants exposed to the DS.  \nA one-way ANOVA was conducted assessing the influence of research summary \ncondition on HA. As predicted, participants in the ES condition had significantly higher HA \nscores (M = 2.06, SD = 1.00) than participants in the DS condition (M = 1.70, SD = .91): F(1, \n223) = 7.25, p < .01, d = .37. The result was amplified when participants who failed the \ncomprehension check were excluded: MES = 2.00, SD = 1.00; MDS = 1.53, SD = .72; F(1, 166) = \n11.56, p < .001, d = .53. The effect of the manipulation becomes even more apparent after \ncontrolling for the variance attributable to age, Religiosity, and PO. For the full sample, HA \nscores in the ES condition (with covariates held at the mean) were significantly higher (M = 2.04, \n45 \n \nSD = .69) than scores in the DS condition (M = 1.72, SD = .69): F(1, 220) = 12.54, p < .001, d = \n.48. Once again, the pattern was magnified when participants who failed the comprehension \ncheck were excluded: MES = 1.96, SD = .63; MDS = 1.59, SD = .63; F(1, 163) = 13.18, p < .001, d \n= .57. Figure 2 shows the means for participants in each condition, separated by whether or not \nthey passed the comprehension check.  \nDiscussion \nThe essentialism-enhancing and essentialism-challenging research summaries had the \npredicted effect on participants’ heterosexism scores, and this effect not only held but actually \nbecame slightly stronger when several demographic variables (age, Religiosity, PO) were \nentered as covariates. While heterosexism levels were somewhat low overall in the current \nsample, the effect sizes for the difference between conditions spanned the medium range, \nindicating that this could be a fruitful avenue for future research into intervention strategies for \nheterosexism.  \nA substantial proportion of participants answered the comprehension check item \nincorrectly, which was surprising considering that all participants who viewed the final version \nof the stimulus materials in the pilot study passed this check. It is possible that the difference \nbetween the in-lab and online format contributed to this discrepancy, as participants taking the \nstudy online may have been less motivated or less able to give the study their full attention. \nIndeed, participants who answered the comprehension item incorrectly spent an average of one \nand a half fewer minutes taking the survey, and of the 58 participants who failed the check, over \n20% completed the survey in fewer than five minutes, compared to only 10% of participants who \nanswered the item correctly. While this occurrence did not unduly compromise the current \n46 \n \nproject (with the covariates in the model, the effect of condition was significant whether or not \nparticipants answered correctly), it may be important to bear in mind for future studies.  \nThere was one interesting and unexpected pattern I uncovered in the course of examining \npotential demographic differences between my conditions. As noted above, when taking into \naccount the whole sample, the conditions did not differ with regard to political orientation (PO) – \nhowever, once participants who failed the comprehension check were excluded, a significant \ndifference was revealed, with participants in the essentializing condition (ES) reporting more \nconservative attitudes (M = 3.53, SD = 1.60) than participants in the de-essentializing condition \n(DS, M = 3.08, SD = 1.25): t(165.30) = 2.07, p  = .04. Upon closer examination, this effect was \nrevealed to be primarily driven by responses to the item assessing participants’ political ideology \nwith regard to social issues: t(164.98) = 3.03, p < .01. Participants in the ES condition reported \nsignificantly greater social conservatism (M = 3.31, SD = 1.75) than participants in the DS \ncondition (M = 2.58, SD = 1.38), while effects for the other two items trended non-significantly \nin the same direction. This may have been merely a quirk of random assignment that \ncoincidentally was not apparent in the full sample; alternatively, given that all participants \nresponded to the demographic questionnaire last, and therefore after the manipulation, it may be \nthat the manipulation somehow influenced participants’ reported political attitudes, making them \nmore endorsing of social conservatism in general when gender essentialist beliefs were made \nsalient.

Rather than merely focusing on the within-domain \neffect of essentialist beliefs on these attitudes, I instead investigate essentialist beliefs related to a \ndomain that is highly theoretically entwined with sexual orientation – namely, gender. The \ntheoretical basis for the link I have suggested here was already substantially developed, and \nseveral pieces of empirical evidence provided abstract support for the purported connection. \nResults of the current project provide further support for the contention that part of the animus \ntoward gay men and lesbians is driven by a desire to maintain the gender status quo, and the \nessentializing ideologies that support it, and a perception that gay unions undermine this goal. A \nrecent illustration of this emerged in the months preceding the Supreme Court’s hearing of the \nCalifornia Proposition 8 case. In defense of his opposition toward gay marriage, Brian Brown \n(president of the nonprofit National Organization for Marriage) invoked the concept of essential \ndifferences between men and women: “The notion of the uniqueness of men and women is […] a \nkey part of our view of humanity: that there are two halves of humanity, male and female, and \nthat we complement each other…” (Stolberg, 2013). \nAs the results of Study One revealed, there is a significant relationship between this way \nof looking at gender and negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians – a relationship partially \ndriven by the belief that gays threaten or undermine these gender related values. Although the \nubiquity of system justification tendencies means that women as well as men are sometimes \ndisposed to support the gender status quo, men have more to gain in this process, and thus can be \n51 \n \nexpected to endorse gender essentialism more readily. Indeed, in the current project, men did on \naverage exhibit greater gender essentialism, and this partially mediated the sex difference in \nheterosexism. The relationship of authoritarianism to heterosexism was also partially mediated \nby essentialist gender beliefs and symbolic beliefs about gays’ threat to gender values, which \nhelps to illuminate the mechanisms behind this incredibly powerful and oft-cited predictor of \nheterosexist attitudes. Study Two provided further support for the proposal that gender \nessentialism gives rise to negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians by experimentally \nmanipulating the salience of essentialist ideas about gender, and observing the corresponding \ninfluence on heterosexist attitudes.  \nA possible limitation of the current project is that attitudes toward gay men and lesbians \nin both of my samples tended on the whole to be fairly positive. Even amongst participants in \nStudy 1 who endorsed gender essentialist beliefs more highly than their peers (those 38 \nparticipants scoring one standard deviation or more above the mean for gender essentialism), \nheterosexist attitudes were below the scale mid-point (M = 2.85, SD = 1.10), indicating either \nambivalence or indifference rather than negativity per se. The same was true for my Study 2 \nparticipants who received the essentializing stimulus: mean levels of heterosexism clustered \naround 2, the place on the scale that indicates ‘slight’ disagreement with items expressing \nnegative sentiments about gay men and lesbians / gay rights. Thus it may be more accurate to \nconceptualize the results of the current project in terms of those variables that predict greater \npositivity toward / acceptance of gay men and lesbians, rather than variables predicting more \nnegative attitudes. It should be noted, however, that there was not a complete lack of \nrepresentation at the more negative end of the attitude spectrum: 16.1% of the sample in Study 1 \n52 \n \nscored above the scale mid-point (these scores ranged from 3.04 to 4.68), as did 15.6% of the \nsample in Study 2 (scores ranging from 3.04 all the way to 5). \nExploring the Role of Implicit Inversion Theory \nReturning to the mediating effect of symbolic beliefs on the relationship between gender \nessentialism and heterosexism, in my original theorizing, I proposed that this pattern may only \nemerge amongst those participants who held beliefs about gays that were consistent with implicit \ninversion theory (that is, believing that gay men and lesbians are more like their opposite-sex \nthan same-sex heterosexual counterparts). Specifically, my logic was that the relationship \nbetween gender essentialism and negative symbolic beliefs about gays would be moderated by \nendorsement of the implicit inversion theory. When the initial mediation model was successful, I \ndiscarded this alternative hypothesis, yet I was still interested in exploring the relationship of the \nImplicit Inversion Theory composite (IIT) with these variables.  \nUnsurprisingly, IIT was positively correlated with gender essentialist beliefs (r = .60, p < \n.001) and heterosexist attitudes (r = .52, p < .001), and was related to more negative symbolic \nbeliefs (r = -.29, p < .001). Endorsement of IIT was greater amongst men (MM = 2.96, SDM = .73; \nMF = 2.44, SDF = .81; t[220] = -5.04, p < .001) and was positively correlated with both the \nreligiosity (r = .21, p < .01) and political orientation (r = .41, p < .001) composites. Controlling \nfor the influence of these demographic variables, the correlations with gender essentialism (rp = \n.50, p < .001) and heterosexism (rp = .37, p < .001) were attenuated but remained highly \nsignificant; the relationship with symbolic beliefs was reduced to marginal significance (rp = -\n.13, p < .06).  \n53 \n \nFollow-up analyses revealed a significant interaction between gender essentialism and \nIIT in predicting heterosexist attitudes (B = .16, p < .01),13 similar to the interaction between \ngender essentialism and traditional gender role norm endorsement. I also discovered that IIT \ncould serve as an alternative mediator of the relationship between gender essentialism and \nheterosexism (Bab = .14, p < .05), and that when IIT and symbolic beliefs were entered \nsimultaneously as mediators, they more or less accounted for the whole effect of gender \nessentialism on heterosexism, reducing the coefficient for that path from .27 (p < .001) to .08 (p \n= .16). My initial moderated mediation hypothesis, however, was not supported. Specifically, IIT \ndid not moderate the relationship between gender essentialism and negative symbolic beliefs \nabout gays (B = -.003, p = .96).  \nSignificance of Current Findings and Future Directions \nPrevious research has shown that manipulating domain-specific (specifically racial) \nessentialism can influence creativity through the domain-general mechanism of closed-\nmindedness (Tadmor, Chao, Hong, & Polzer, 2012) and also that manipulating essentialist \npatterns of thought in a domain-general way (by inducing nonfluid movement versus fluid \nmovement) can result in greater domain-specific essentialism as well as domain-general \nstereotype endorsement (Slepian, Weisbuch, Pauker, Bastian, & Ambady, 2014). However, \nprevious research has not examined the influence of essentialism across specific domains (that is, \ndomain-specific essentialist beliefs about one group had not been studied as predictors of \nattitudes toward a different social category). Results of the current project thus contribute to the \nbroad field of essentialism research, as well as contributing to our understanding of the roots of \nheterosexism. Based on the results of the current project, for instance, one can predict that if one \n                                                 \n13 For each of the analyses described in this paragraph, participant sex, age, religiosity, political orientation, and \nidentifying as Black were treated as covariates. \n54 \n \nmanipulated perceptions of gender status distributions such that the gender hierarchy was \ndepicted as unstable, with women making gains (as Morton, Postmes, Haslam, and Hornsey did \nin their 2009 study), this would lead to more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and \nparticularly amongst men, than if the gender hierarchy was depicted as stable. This is perhaps of \nparticular relevance at present because of the media preoccupation with the decline of \n‘traditional’ masculinity (Rosin, 2010; Salam, 2009). \nFinally, the results of Study Two are encouraging in that they may point the way toward a \npotential intervention strategy to reduce anti-gay prejudice. While the somewhat abstracted type \nof manipulation employed in this study is unlikely to produce lasting effects, a more structured \nand elaborate program aimed at decreasing essentialist beliefs about gender may be successful. \nFuture research should investigate this possibility, particularly focusing on the durability of \nattitude change, and what factors are necessary to facilitate acceptance of the de-essentializing \nmessage. Another possibility would be to directly challenge the symbolic beliefs (and / or the \nendorsement of stereotypes consistent with implicit inversion theory) that help to form the link \nbetween gender essentialism and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. This may in fact be \neasier to accomplish than breaking down such a comfortable and relied-upon structure as gender \ndichotomization; however, the ultimate interests of society may yet be better served by taking the \nmore difficult path, and fusing the causes of feminism and LGBT advocacy.   \n  \n55 \n \n \n \nReferences \nAltemeyer, B.

Why that Nutrition Label Might Not Be as Accurate as You Think. \n \nPeople who meticulously track their calorie intake should be cautious: their tallies may be \nwrong. Recent studies show that our current system for calculating calories, which dates back \nmore than 100 years, neglects several factors that influence the accuracy of these estimates. For \nthe most part, the inaccuracies are small, but some discrepancies are as high as 50 percent, \nexperts say.  \n \nHigh fiber foods, for instance, are not digested as well, so the number of calories we \nactually get from these foods is less than estimated. The degree of processing — eating a carrot \nthat's pureed rather than whole, for example — also changes the proportion of calories we get \nfrom a food. Food processing takes some of the work out of digestion, meaning that a processed \nfood will generally have close to the estimated number of calories, whereas whole foods will \n(functionally speaking) yield fewer calories than estimated. The difference is biggest (around \n20% - 30%) for starchy foods, like potatoes, and is lowest (5% - 10%) for meats. \n \nStructural differences in food also make some calories inaccessible to our bodies. For \nexample, some of the fat in whole almonds is locked away in a structure our bodies can't digest. \nWhile standard estimates say a serving of whole almonds has about 170 calories, more recent \nstudies find it actually yields about 130. When we digest food, we also give off energy as heat. \nThe amount of heat we radiate depends upon the type of food. For proteins, it's about 20 to 30 \npercent of the food's calories — so if we eat 100 calories worth of protein, we only absorb 70-80 \ncalories from it. \n \nSome researchers say these inaccuracies don't make much difference. People tend to eat a \nvariety of foods, so incorrectly estimating the calories in one particular food should have little \ninfluence on one’s daily calorie intake. Also, the current system tends to result in overestimates, \nmeaning it should only pose a problem for people seeking to gain weight. But other researchers \nsay the goal of a revision would be to give people as much accurate information as possible to \nhelp them make informed choices about food. Such a process could result in broad changes, \nincluding new numbers for the total calories people need in a day. \n66 \n \n \n \nFinal Stimulus for Essentializing Condition (ES): \n \nBelow is a brief research summary of the currently prevailing psychological theories regarding \ncertain behavioral and attitudinal attributes of men and women. Please read the summary \ncarefully, because you will be asked questions about it later. \n \nEvolved Mating Differences Between Men and Women – Research Suggests Fundamental \nDissimilarities \n \nEvolutionary mating theory (an offshoot of evolutionary psychology) suggests that men \nand women differ fundamentally in their sexual attitudes and mating behaviors, due to the \ndistinctive challenges men and women have faced throughout human evolution as a result of \ntheir different roles in reproduction (Buss, 1995). According to this argument, men have an \nevolved predisposition to seek a variety of sexual partners for short-term mating, in order to best \nenhance their chances of producing offspring. Women, on the other hand, must be more selective \nin choosing a mate, due to their greater obligatory investment in the reproductive process. \nIndeed, evidence from multiple studies suggests that men tend to exhibit more sexually \npermissive attitudes and behaviors than women do. For instance, men consistently report \nengaging in casual and extramarital sex with greater frequency than women do, and report \nhaving a greater number of sexual partners than women do (Brand, Markey, & Hodges, 2007). \nAdditionally, men's attitudes toward casual sex tend to be more positive than women's. These \ndifferences have been replicated in many studies and are statistically fairly large, according to a \nmeta-analysis by Petersen and Hyde (2010). \n \nSimilarly, evolutionary mating theory suggests that men are disposed to focus on the \nattractiveness of a potential mate, as a cue to fertility. Women, conversely, are disposed to focus \non cues that a potential mate will have adequate material resources to invest in any potential \n67 \n \noffspring. Evidence from multiple sources supports this proposed difference. For instance, some \nstudies have examined the content of personal ads and dating profiles created by men and \nwomen. They found that men were more likely to offer information about their status and \nresources, and mention information about desired physical traits in their prospective partner. \nWomen, on the other hand, were more likely to offer information about physical appearance, and \nmention status related traits as part of what they were seeking in a potential partner (see Geher & \nMiller, 2012, for a review). In sum, a growing body of research supports the evolutionary mating \npsychology perspective, and suggests that the male and female psyches may be hardwired to be \nfundamentally different. \n \n \n \nFinal Stimulus for De-essentializing Condition (ES): \n \nBelow is a brief research summary of the currently prevailing psychological theories regarding \ncertain behavioral and attitudinal attributes of men and women. Please read the summary \ncarefully, because you will be asked questions about it later. \n \nEvolved Mating Differences Between Men and Women? Research Suggests More Similarities \nthan Differences \n \nEvolutionary mating theory (a controversial offshoot of evolutionary psychology) \nproposes that men and women differ fundamentally in their sexual attitudes and mating \nbehaviors, due to the distinctive challenges men and women have faced throughout human \nevolution as a result of their different roles in reproduction (Buss, 1995). According to this \nargument, men have an evolved predisposition to seek a variety of sexual partners for short-term \nmating, in order to best enhance their chances of producing offspring. Women, on the other \nhand, must be more selective in choosing a mate, due to their greater obligatory investment in the \n68 \n \nreproductive process. Evolutionary mating theory also suggests that men are disposed to focus on \nthe attractiveness of a potential mate, as a cue to fertility. Women, conversely, are disposed to \nfocus on cues that a potential mate will have adequate material resources to invest in any \npotential offspring. However, many researchers have questioned the validity of this theory, and \nnow the evidence is stacking up against it. \n \nChallengers of evolutionary mating theory point out that while men report that they \nparticularly value attractiveness and women report that they value partners’ earning potential, \nthese reports often fail to predict actual behavior (Kurzban & Weeden, 2007), especially \nattraction to a live interaction partner, as opposed to photographs (Eastwick, Eagly, Finkel, & \nJohnson, 2011). Basic evolutionary psychology tells us that selection pressures work at the \nbehavioral level—they shape human psychology by favoring behaviors that yield certain \noutcomes. If, for instance, women claim that they value partners’ earning potential but do not \nactually select partners on this basis, then self-reports are a bad test for the predictions of \nevolutionary mating theory. Furthermore, studies have confirmed that men’s supposed tendency \nto assign greater importance to partners’ physical attractiveness than women do does not emerge \nwhen implicit measures are used (Eastwick et al., 2011). \n \nResearchers also debate the need to suggest an evolved cause when a more immediate \ncause will suffice: that is, obedience to social norms. In highly sensitive domains like sexuality, \nsocial norms are especially likely to influence explicit responses of men and women. For \ninstance, men will report earlier and more diverse sexual experiences than women mainly when \ntheir responses might become known to others. Conversely, in studies that motivated participants \nto be as accurate as possible, these sex differences in reported sexuality decreased and sometimes \nreversed (Alexander & Fisher, 2003). In sum, a growing body of research has challenged the \nproposition that the male and female psyches are hardwired to be different. Rather, men and \nwomen appear to be very similar, and the small differences that do exist are likely driven by \nsocial and cultural factors. \n \n \n69 \n \nEvaluation of Research Summary (items selected from Morton, Haslam, Postmes, & Ryan, \n2006): \n \n1) How convincing were the research findings in the summary you just read? \n \n1 2 3 4 5 \nNot at all \nconvincing    \nVery \nconvincing \n \n2) How biased was the presentation of findings in the summary you just read?* \n \n1 2 3 4 5 \nNot at all \nbiased    Very biased \n \n3) Would you agree or disagree that the research summary you just read makes a significant \ncontribution to the understanding of human nature?14 \n \n1 2 3 4 5 \nDisagree \nStrongly \nDisagree \nSlightly \nNeither Agree \nnor Disagree Agree Slightly Agree Strongly \n \nComprehension Check: \n \nWhich of the following statements most closely summarizes the research synopsis you read a \nfew minutes ago? \na.

    "abstract": "Social psychology researchers have become increasingly interested in the role of essentialist beliefs in predicting attitudes toward social groups. However, there is little agreement about what the term actually means, whether it means different things for different groups, what endorsement of essentialism (or its sub-components) means for attitudes, and how much this varies depending on the relevant social context. This underlying lack of clarity helps to explain some of the difficulty in understanding the relationships between essentialist beliefs about sexual orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. In the current project, I suggest a fundamental shift in the approach to this issue. Specifically, I examine the effects of essentialist beliefs related to gender (rather than essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation) on heterosexist attitudes. In study one, I explore the interrelationships among gender- and sexual orientation-related beliefs and attitudes toward gays, revealing that essentialist beliefs about gender are more consistent and unitary in their relationship to heterosexism than the sexual-orientation related analogues. In my second study, I demonstrate a causal link by manipulating essentialist beliefs about gender. Increasing the salience of gender essentialist beliefs produced higher heterosexism scores relative to decreasing the salience of such beliefs. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the interconnectedness of sexism and the gender hierarchy with heterosexism and discrimination against gays. More importantly, study two forecasts a possible intervention strategy for reducing anti-gay prejudice",
