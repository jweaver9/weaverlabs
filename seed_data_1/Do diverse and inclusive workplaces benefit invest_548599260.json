    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions slow down, employees start to return to\ntheir offices. Hence, the discussions on optimal workplaces and issues of\ndiversity and inclusion have peaked. Previous research has shown that employees\nand companies benefit from positive workplace changes. This research questions\nwhether allowing for diversity and inclusion criteria in portfolio construction\nis beneficial to investors. By considering the new Diversity & Inclusion (D&I)\nscore by Refinitiv, I find evidence that investors might suffer lower returns\nand pay for investing in responsible (i.e., more diverse and inclusive)\nemployers in both the US and European market",
