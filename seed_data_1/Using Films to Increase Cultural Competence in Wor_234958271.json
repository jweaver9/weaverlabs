Experiential learning activities, such as watching films, can increase \nstudents’ knowledge of their attitudes and beliefs about themselves and culturally diverse clients. This \nqualitative study explored, in the context of a sexuality and counseling course, how 27 students’ \nawareness, knowledge, and skills were influenced by the use of two films, For the Bible Tells Me So and \nNormal, which illuminate the experiences of LGBTQ individuals and their families. Results and \nimplications for counselor educators are provided. \nKeywords \nexperiential teaching, LGBTQ, cultural competence, films, counselor education \nThis article is available in The Journal of Counselor Preparation and Supervision: https://repository.wcsu.edu/jcps/\nvol9/iss2/8 \n Counselor educators are positioned to train students to work effectively and empathically \nwithin diverse populations such as the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) \ncommunities.  To accomplish this, counseling training must be informed by evolving cultural \ncompetencies, including issues involving sexual orientation and gender identity (Association of \nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in Counseling [ALGBTIC], 2009; ALGBTIC \nLGBQQIA Competencies Taskforce [ALGBTIC], 2013).  And, while counselor educators are \nrequired to include multicultural material in all courses (American Counseling Association \n[ACA], 2014), students often report feeling inadequately trained to work with LGBTQ clients \n(Bidell, 2005; 2013; Graham, Carney, & Kluck, 2012; Rock, Carson, & McGeorge, 2010).   \n Research indicates that students express more confidence in working with issues related \nto sexuality when they receive specific sexuality training (Miller & Byers, 2008; 2010), and it is \nrecommended that more specific training related to sexual orientation and LGBTQ needs should \nbe added to counseling curriculum (Biaggio, Orchard, Larson, Petrino, & Mahara, 2003; Dillon \net al., 2004; Frank & Cannon, 2010; Goodrich & Luke, 2010; Israel & Hackett, 2004; Long & \nSerovich, 2003; Luke, Goodrich, & Scarborough, 2011).  Moreover, it has been suggested that \nall counseling programs should require at least one graduate level counseling sexuality course, \nwith a focus on LGBTQ issues, because all counselors will work with non-heterosexual clients \nand the intense personal reflection required to work effectively with LGBTQ clients cannot be \nadequately piecemealed into other courses (Bidell, 2013; Irving, 2014).  Not all counseling \nprograms, however, offer courses specific to sexuality counseling (Kocarek & Pelling, 2003; \nMallicoat & Gibson, 2014), and there is a dearth of research on effective strategies for teaching \ncounselors-in-training how to work more effectively with LGBTQ clients (Chavez-Korell & \nJohnson, 2010; Walters & Rehma, 2013).   \n Experiential teaching methods have been found to be effective in enhancing diversity \nawareness (Lazloffy & Habekost, 2010) and cultivating clinical skills from theoretical \nknowledge (Knecht-Sabres, 2010; Yardley, Teunissen, & Dornan, 2012).  Therefore, the intent \nof this qualitative study was to explore, in the context of a sexuality and counseling course, how \nif at all, students’ cultural competence (awareness, knowledge, and skills) was influenced by the \nexperiential teaching method of using films that illuminate the experiences of LGBTQ \nindividuals and their families.    \nExperiential Teaching \n Counselors-in-training must increase their awareness, knowledge, and skills about their \npersonal values and biases, clients’ worldviews, and culturally appropriate interventions in order \nto become culturally competent counselors (Chao, Wei, Good, & Flores, 2011: Hipolito-\nDelgado, Cook, Avrus, & Bonham, 2011).  To accomplish this, counselor educators can use \nexperiential learning activities to increase students’ knowledge of their attitudes and beliefs \nabout themselves and culturally diverse clients (Council for Accreditation and Related \nEducational Programs [CACREP], 2009).  Experiential activities that incorporate student \nreflection on the connection between one’s self and those who are culturally diverse are one of \nthe best ways to impact student learning (Arthur & Achenback, 2002; Collins, Arthur, & Wong-\nWylie, 2010; Fawcett, Briggs, Maycock, & Stine, 2010).   \n Experiential teaching methods move beyond didactic teaching methods by broadening \nstudents’ learning from readings and lectures to lived experiences (Villalba & Redmond, 2008) \nin order to create cultural sensitivity (Kim & Lyons, 2003; Laszloffy & Habekost, 2010).  \nExperiential learning methods expand what students learn cognitively and move them into more \naffective learning, thus increasing their self-awareness of what personal beliefs impact their \nprofessional roles as counselors (Hipolito-Delgado et al., 2011; Loya & Cuevas, 2010).  Further, \nexperiential learning methods provide students a medium to learn through others’ lived \nexperiences (Laszloffy & Habekost, 2010; Perry & Southwell, 2011), develop empathy for \ndiverse clients (McDowell, Goessling, & Melendez, 2012; Villalba & Redmond, 2008; Walters \n& Rehma, 2013), and bridge the gap between theory and practice (Knecht-Sabres, 2010; Yardley \net al., 2012).   \n The use of films is one form of experiential teaching that has been found effective \n(Armstrong & Berg, 2007; Johnson, 2011; Koch & Dollarhide, 2000; Pierce & Wooloff, 2012; \nStinchfield, 2006; Villalba & Redmond, 2008; Whipple & Tucker, 2012) and used in various \ncounseling courses (e.g., ethics, multicultural counseling, group counseling, and theories).  Films \nprovide a means of contact with unfamiliar populations and controversial issues from a safe \ndistance (Chavez-Korell & Johnson, 2010; Higgins & Dermer, 2001), allow students to practice \nobservational skills, and are catalysts for class discussions about best counseling practices (Dave \n& Tandon, 2011; Villalba & Redmond, 2008).  Coupled with watching films, classroom \ndiscussions and reflective journal writing help students process their emotional responses from \nthe experiential activities, and transfer their personal reactions into professional application \n(Arthur & Achenbach, 2002; Whipple & Tucker, 2012).   \n Films also enable students to practice and increase empathy (Gerdes, Segal, Jackson, & \nMullins, 2011; Roell, 2010) because they allow students to respond to the character’s experience \nwhich triggers their imagination and affective associations and increases their cognitive \nunderstanding and emotional experiences (Ahn, Jin, & Ritterfeld, 2012; Igartua, 2010).  Further, \nwatching films and processing cognitive and affective responses are active learning methods that \nincrease diversity awareness (Loya & Cuevas, 2010; Villalba & Redmond, 2008) and improve \nperceptual, conceptual, and executive skills (Higgins & Dermer, 2001; Oh, Kang, & De Gagne, \n2012; Warren, Stech, Douglas, & Lambert, 2010).  Thus, students are better able to collect and \nobserve data (perceptual skill), understand data in a coherent manner (conceptual skill), and \ninfluence clients based on what was observed and understood (executive skill).   \nFilm Selection \n The use of films with LGBTQ content and characters has been recommended as a method \nof teaching about sexual orientation and the needs of the LGBTQ communities (Bidell, 2013; \nLong & Serovich, 2003).  For this study, two films were chosen that depicted potential \nchallenges individuals and families experience (e.g., family and community reactions, religious \nviews, etc.) in the process of coming out or transitioning.  At the time of this study, the authors \nnoted that it was difficult to find films that encompassed these experiences for all members of the \nLGBTQ communities; therefore, the selected films provide examples of what individuals who \nidentify as lesbian, gay, or transgender may experience.  For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, \n2007) is a 98-minute documentary about the lives of five Christian families whose children are \nlesbian or gay.  This film reveals the lived experiences of each family and offers diverse \ninterpretations of spirituality and sexuality by clergy and leaders from various religious \nbackgrounds.  The intention of using this film was to open dialogue about the following: (a) how \nreligion and sexuality play a part in LGBTQ clients’ lives, including societal support and \noppression; (b) how personal values may play a role when working with clients and their \nfamilies; and (c) how to work effectively and ethically without imposing these values and beliefs \n(ACA, 2014).   \n For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007), however, does not depict members of the \ntransgender community and students need additional information about contextual factors (e.g., \npsychological, political, historical) that influence transgender identity development (ALGBTIC, \n2009; Carroll, Gilroy, & Ryan, 2002; Preston, 2011).  Therefore, the second film, Normal \n(Busch, Brokaw, Pilcher, & Anderson, 2003), was selected to provide an example of what a \nperson might experience during transition, including emotional responses, clothing choices, \nvoice modulation, and changes at work, home, and in the community.  This 108-minute film is a \nfictional portrayal about a Midwestern family whose father figure decides to pursue sexual \nreassignment and the reactions from family members, co-workers, and the church community.  \nThis movie also portrays the evolving family dynamics around the father’s decision, all of which \nare important for counselors to be aware of when working with transgender clients and their \nfamilies.   \nMethod \n The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how, if at all, watching the movie, \nFor the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007), influenced students’ perceptions of the LGBTQ \ncommunities and what families experience when a child or family member is gay.  And how, if \nat all, watching the movie, Normal (Busch et al., 2003), influenced students’ perceptions of the \ntransgender community and how families cope with a family member going through transition.  \nThe authors adhered to ACA Code of Ethics research guidelines (ACA, 2014) and used the \nconsensual qualitative research (CQR) method to conduct a rigorous analysis of participants’ \nexperiences and make judgments about the meaning of the data (Hill et al., 2005).  The essential \nelements of CQR include the use of: (a) open-ended questions to capture participant experiences; \n(b) judges who analyze the data independently and work together as a team to reach general \nconsensus; (c) an external auditor who evaluates the findings generated by the primary research \nteam; and (d) data analysis procedures that generate domains, core ideas, and cross case analysis \n(Hill et al., 2005). \nParticipants  \n The recommended strong sample size for CQR is at least 8 - 15 participants (Hill, \nThompson, & Williams, 1997; Hill et al., 2005).  The participants in this study were a \nconvenience sample of 27 individuals; 24 women and three men.  Twenty-four participants \nidentified their ethnicity or race as Caucasian, one identified as African-American, one identified \nas Hispanic, and one identified as Latin.  Their ages ranged from 23 – 56 (M = 35).  Participants \nwere graduate students from counseling (N = 19), social work (N = 4), psychology (N = 3), and \ncollege student personnel (N = 1) programs, and all were enrolled in one of two sexuality courses \ntaught by the first author; one course was offered at a university in the Midwest, the other at a \nuniversity in the Southeast.   \nResearch Team  \n It is imperative for researchers to discuss their positionality and characteristics that may \ninfluence study design, data collection, and analysis (Merriam, 1998).  The team responsible for \ndata analysis included the three authors, who are three faculty members in a CACREP-accredited \ncounseling program.  The research team discussed their assumptions about the use of films in \nfacilitating professional competence in counseling and their beliefs about qualitative research.  \nAll team members use films in their courses and believe based on experience and student \nfeedback that this method of instruction serves to enhance students’ understanding of the \nmaterial taught in classes.  All three members also agreed an important reason for facilitating this \nstudy is their commitment to integrating student feedback in their evidence-based teaching \nstrategies.  Additionally, the authors discussed their assumptions that students may not receive \nadequate training for working with LGBTQ clients by having only one cross-cultural course or \nlimited references across counseling curriculum, and their biases that students need additional \ntraining to better serve this client population.  Discussions about assumptions and biases toward \nthis particular type of teaching tool and student outcomes were ongoing.  All team members \npreviously conducted qualitative studies using CQR.  Prior to beginning data analysis, members \nreviewed the Hill et al. articles (1997; 2005) and the general procedures for CQR analysis.   \nInstruments \n Research questions and questionnaires were developed after an extensive review of the \nliterature as recommended by the CQR founders, Hill et al. (1997).  Two interviews were \nconducted prior to the study and questions were revised based on those interviews (Hill et al., \n1997; Hill et al., 2005).  As is recommended, data was collected twice from each participant (Hill \net al., 1997; Hill et al., 2005).   \n Questionnaires.  The research team worked together to generate a series of open-ended \nquestions in a semi-structured questionnaire (see Appendix for pre/post questionnaires) to solicit \nparticipant perspectives on two films.  Students completed surveys on their thoughts, feelings, \nand reactions about LGBTQ clients and their families, the provision of counseling to LGBTQ \nclients and families, and general reactions to the films immediately before and after viewing each \nfilm.  Participants also received demographic forms attached to the questionnaires.  Participants \nwere asked to indicate age, gender, ethnicity/race, and graduate program (e.g., counseling, social \nwork, psychology, or college student personnel).  Participants also were asked if they had \npreviously viewed each film.  \n Reflection Journals.  In an effort to gather a more in-depth understanding of student \nperspectives and better ensure credibility of the findings, students were encouraged to fully \nelaborate on their perspectives and reactions to the films in a reflective journal.  Students \nsubmitted their journal reflections at the end of the week in which each film was viewed.  A final \nreflection summary paper with reflective prompts about both films was submitted at the end of \nthe course.    \nProcedure \n After approval from both university institutional review boards, the students were \nprovided with an informed consent form at the beginning of the course explaining the purpose of \nthe study and their rights as participants, emphasizing that their grades would not be influenced \nby participation (or non-participation) in the study.  Pseudonyms were used in place of \nparticipants’ names to protect their anonymity.  Additionally, students were informed that the \nfilm material could be considered controversial and that the purpose of showing the films was \nnot to change their personal or religious beliefs, but rather to create dialogue about what their \nclients may be experiencing and processing in therapy sessions.  Further, students were \ninstructed that class discussions were voluntary and a safe place to discuss thoughts and reactions \nto the films’ content, and that additional support would be provided for anyone that needed to \nprocess his/her experiences, individually (i.e., meet with the instructor, other faculty, or support \nservices).  The films were shown during two class periods where participants were provided \nquestionnaires before and after the films.  Class discussions followed each film; a film was \nwatched during the first half of a three-hour class and then students processed their reactions, \nquestions, and how to apply what they watched to counseling situations.  Participants also wrote \nweekly reflections to further process their thoughts and feelings, and then submitted summary \npapers of these reflections at the end of the course.  \n \nData Analysis \n Consensual qualitative research (CQR) methodology was used to derive meaning from \nthe data through a process of individual analysis followed by group consensus (Hill et al., 1997; \nHill et al., 2005).  At each stage of the data analysis process, the first two authors coded data \nindependently before meeting to reach consensus.  The third author served as an auditor who \nevaluated the data analysis.  Although three coders are recommended, two coders are considered \nacceptable (Hill et al., 2005).  Data analysis was done in two phases.  For the Bible Tells Me So \n(Karslake, 2007) was analyzed first.  Domains, core ideas, and cross-case analysis was \ncompleted before analyzing data from Normal (Busch et al., 2003).  The same data analysis \nprocedures were used for each film.  \nDomain Coding and Core Ideas \n Team members worked independently to generate domain codes for each film.  As a \ngroup, emergent domains were discussed and ultimately consensus was reached.  The domain \ncodes served as the conceptual frameworks for housing segments of data (Hill et al., 1997; Hill et \nal., 2005).  Domain codes were continually analyzed to best capture core ideas from the data.  \nNext, the team independently generated concise descriptions of the clustered data within each \ndomain.  The team then met and worked toward consensus.  Condensed descriptions were then \ncompared to the original narratives to ensure that the data were free of assumptions and \ninterpretations.  \nCross Case Analysis  \n For each film, team members worked independently to identify commonalities among \ncore ideas that could be grouped into similar clusters of meaning.  Once team consensus was \nreached, tallies were generated to determine the frequency.  The terms general, typical, and \nvariant are used to describe the frequency of each category (Hill et al., 2005).  A general \ncategory refers to all or all but one of the cases, a typical category refers to more than half of the \ncases, and a variant category includes more than two but less than half of the cases.  Categories \nwith less than three cases were not included in the analysis.   \nQuality and Trustworthiness \n The research team addressed credibility, dependability, transferability, and confirmability \n(Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 2009; Morrow, 2005) to enhance the rigor of this study.  In an \neffort to promote credibility, the following steps were taken: biases and expectations were \ndiscussed and noted; an auditor checked and provided feedback on the domains, core ideas, and \ncategories generated and tallied by the first two authors; and participants’ reflective journals and \nsummary papers were used to triangulate the findings.  Dependability was achieved by \nmaintaining a thorough audit trail of procedures, data collection, and analysis: team members \nworked independently to read surveys and generate domains, core ideas, and cross-case \ncategories; as a group, members discussed domains, core ideas, and cross-case categories with \nthe intent of developing a consensus; tallies were used to determine the frequency of cross-case \noccurrences; and how decisions were reached by the team (Merriam, 2009; Morrow, 2005).  \nAdditionally, efforts were made to increase transferability by providing demographics of \nparticipants, descriptive quotes from the data, and a clear description of procedures undertaken \n(Hunt, 2011).  Further, the research team addressed confirmability by discussing their \nassumptions and biases, maintaining an audit trail to promote transparency of the process, and \nhaving ongoing discussions to ensure emerging themes were directly supported by the data (De \nStefano, Atkins, Noble, & Heath, 2012). \n \nResults \n Final consensus among the research team identified three themes for both films: \nemotional reactions, new awareness, and counseling applications (see Table 1).  Following CQR \nguidelines (Hill et al., 1997; Hill et al., 2005), a general category represents all or all but one of \nthe cases (n = 27); a typical category represents at least half of the cases (n = 13); and a variant \ncategory represented less than half but more than two of the cases (n = 3 - 12).  Following, \nfindings are presented separately for each film.  \nTable 1 \nThemes and Frequencies of Participants’ Responses \nThemes For the Bible Tells Me So Frequency \nEmotional Reactions Typical (23) \nNew Awareness Typical (15) \nCounseling Applications Typical (18) \nThemes Normal Frequency \nEmotional Reactions Typical (17) \nNew Awareness Typical (18) \nCounseling Applications Variant (12) \nNote.  N = 27.  Typical = category applied to at least 13 or more of the cases; variant = category \napplied to fewer than half of the cases.   \n \nFor the Bible Tells Me So \n Emotional Reactions.  Of the three domains, the film had the most impact on \nparticipants’ emotions, with 23 participants reporting having both positive and negative \nemotional reactions to watching the film.  One participant stated “I felt moved.  I was amazed to \nsee how opinions can change with knowledge and how supportive some families were,” while \nanother stated “change and progress is happening faster than I expected.  [I am] thankful for the \nlanguage to integrate in future discussions with others.”  Conversely, a participant responded “I \nfeel like sobbing.  There is so much about my sexuality I have not worked through,” and another \nparticipant felt “angry that people can be so judgmental.”  Finally, one participant reflected that \n“my heart was made receptive to new thinking.”  With these mixed emotions, participants also \nreported changes in their perception of the intersection between religion and the LGBTQ \ncommunities, and how this new awareness would aid them when working with LGBTQ clients \nand their families. \n New Awareness.  After watching the film, 15 participants reported having a new \nawareness of experiences faced by the LGBTQ communities, including how religious beliefs can \nbe used in the form of support or oppression.  One participant reported before watching the film \nthat he believed “organized religion contributes to oppression,” and after watching the film stated \n“I feel less prejudice against Christianity because I realize it is not the religion that is the source \nof bigotry…I especially appreciated the interviews with the priests, reverends, and the Bishop \nwho beautifully articulated a loving stance…from the holy text.”  Another participant reported \n“[films] like this help develop awareness of issues surrounding homosexuals....I learned a lot \nfrom [the film]....personal beliefs should not infringe on others’ rights to be who they are and \ndevelop without discrimination.”  Further, one participant stated “[I] never thought about gay \nmarriage before [watching the film].  Now I think that God would honor any two people who \nloved each other and wanted that commitment.”  These new perceptions guided participants in \nnew ways to use counseling interventions that would be effective when working with LGBTQ \nclients and their families. \n Counseling Applications.  Eighteen participants articulated ideas of possible counseling \npractices after watching the film, such as fostering increased acceptance, using psychoeducation \nmaterials, identifying supportive people and systems, acknowledging discrimination, and \nadvocacy.  One participant explained “[my] ideas of how to talk with families has completely \nchanged.  I realize the need for support and psychoeducation...I look forward to being less fearful \nof this work.”  In addition, one participant suggested wanting to “provide a safe environment and \nidentify internalized messages of homophobia...discuss healthy self-image and assess for safety \nand suicide.”  Further, one participant reported feeling  \n better equipped to work with families with compassion...understand the role that fear and \n beliefs play in parents....be aware of groups who are disdainful toward LGBTQ and their \n effects on clients....address homophobic remarks, correct myths/stereotypes to create a \n safe space....engage in community....psychoeducation to promote acceptance. \nAfter watching For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007), participants experienced positive and \nnegative emotional reactions, an increased awareness of what lesbian and gay children and their \nfamilies experience when sorting through societal and cultural interpretations of religious text \nand the coming out process, which produced ideas for possible counseling interventions when \nworking with LGBTQ clients and their families.  Participants also reported emotional reactions, \nnew awareness, and counseling applications after watching the film, Normal (Busch et al., 2003). \nNormal \n Emotional Reactions.  After watching Normal (Busch et al., 2003), 17 participants \nreported having an emotional reaction and many identified having more feelings of compassion.   \nOne participant responded that watching the film “gave me empathy and compassion for \ntransgender individuals that I didn’t have previously.”  Another participant said “I have more \ncompassion now.  [Before watching the film] I wanted to judge transgender individuals as \nperverts or just confused.  The [film] really helped communicate that to feel complete a change is \nnecessary.”  Additionally, one participant stated she was “moved with emotion...stirred my \ncompassion...bravery to come out to loved ones is beyond my comprehension....Being who you \nshould be is greater than any rejection you might encounter.  That is phenomenal.”  Further, one \nparticipant reported that she “felt deeply moved...the movie changed me; moved me from pity to \nadmiration.  I needed to be humbled so that my compassion did not become condescension.”  \nSome participants reported that they needed to take a closer look at their preconceived ideas \nabout transgender individuals, such as a person may want to go through transition at any age, not \njust in their 20s.  One participant explained “I found myself semi-uncomfortable.  I had many \nstereotypes of what transitioning looks like and these were challenged....These emotions were \nunexpected for me.”  In addition to emotional reactions, participants reported having a new \nawareness of the transgender community. \n New Awareness.  Compared to the other two themes (i.e., emotional reactions and \ncounseling applications), 18 participants reported the film most increased their awareness and \nknowledge of the transgender community and the transition process.  One participant stated prior \nto watching the film that she was “not sure I have any thoughts [on transgender individuals]” to \nafter watching the film thinking “it’s more than just the clothing they wear.  No one would make \nthis decision…if it wasn’t a very big part of who they are.”  Similarly, prior to watching the film \na participant reported thinking she did not “know much about [transgender individuals] other \nthan feeling like they are in the wrong body and want to use the bathroom of the sex they are...[I] \nwonder if they are homosexuals too,” to after watching the film thinking that it is “heartbreaking \nwhat they go through....my biases have been shattered and I feel hope for those with gender \nconfusion.”  Another participant stated she had an “increase in awareness of the difference \nbetween gender identity and sexual orientation,” and another participant explained the film \n“heightened my awareness of the internal struggle, family process, and community reactions....I \nneed to overcome my own gender stereotypes and preconceived notions.”  Some participants \nnoted their new awareness included new empathy for what transgender individuals experience.  \nOne participant responded that the “movie challenged me to better empathize with a population I \nwould truly labor to understand,” and another participant explained that by feeling the “pain \nfrom each character’s point of view,” that she can “understand a little more what it might feel \nlike...builds empathy and understanding of the range of reactions and emotions a person might \nhave.”  This increase in awareness also aided participants in identifying ways of counseling \ntransgender individuals and their families. \n Counseling Applications.  After watching the film, 12 participants identified counseling \ninterventions they can use when counseling transgender individuals and their families, such as \nfostering acceptance, the need to identify or create clients’ support systems, offering \npsychoeducation materials about going through transition, and monitoring for suicidal ideation.  \nOne participant stated wanting to “prepare individuals and their families by educating [them] on \nwhat to expect....Help families who want to stay together identify ways to make it work.”  \nAnother participant wanted “to be sure not to position the gender change as the client’s entire \nstory.”  In addition, one participant wanted to “understand each person’s perspective in the \nfamily...find support systems, and discuss the risks of coming out [as transgender].”  These \nchoices of professional counseling interventions, coupled with their increased compassion and \nawareness of what transgender individuals may experience when going through transition, were \ngained by watching Normal (Busch et al., 2003).  Moreover, by watching both films about real-\nlife experiences and fictional portrayals of the LGBTQ communities, participants expressed \nhaving expanded what they learned from class readings to better understanding how to \neffectively work with LGBTQ clients and their families in counseling sessions. \nDiscussion \n This qualitative study examined if the experiential teaching method of watching topic-\nspecific films in a sexuality and counseling course would influence students’ awareness, \nknowledge, and skills in working with LGBTQ clients and their families.  Participants’ responses \nindicate that watching the films For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007) and Normal (Busch \net al., 2003) in a sexuality course are useful experiential teaching methods that serve to increase \nstudents’ cultural competencies (ALGBTIC, 2009; Chao et al., 2011; Hipolito-Delgado et al., \n2011; Long & Serovich, 2003).  This study’s findings support previous research that revealed \nthat observing films helped counseling students by eliciting reactions about themselves and \nothers (Arthur & Achenbach, 2002; Koch & Dollaride, 2000; Walters & Rehma, 2013), \nexpanded their cognitive learning into affective learning (Ahn et al., 2012; Arthur & Achenbach, \n2002; Igartua, 2010), and increased their empathy (Gerdes et al., 2011; Koch & Dollarhide, \n2000; Roell, 2010; Villalba & Redmond, 2008) for the LGBTQ communities.  Further, \nprocessing the films’ material through class discussions and reflective journals and papers \nincreased students’ diversity awareness  and sensitivity (Dave & Tandon, 2011; Laszloffy & \nHabekost, 2010; Loya & Cuevas, 2010; Villalba & Redmond, 2008), and helped them to process \ntheir emotional reactions and new perceptions into new professional application (Arthur & \nAchenbach, 2002; Whipple & Tucker, 2012).  The findings from this study also corroborate the \nposition that experiential learning methods help students develop new professional behaviors \n(i.e., executive skills) by improving how students observe and gather information (i.e., perceptual \nskills) about themselves and others, and how to make sense of clients’ lived experiences with \ntheir new awareness and knowledge (i.e., conceptual skills) (Higgins & Dermer, 2002; Oh et al., \n2012; Warren et al., 2010).    \n Based on these findings, it appears that students who had emotional reactions (i.e., \nincreased affective learning) and/or an increased awareness of the experiences of LGBTQ \nindividuals were able to translate these into counseling interventions for LGBTQ clients and \ntheir families.  More participants had an emotional reaction to watching For the Bible Tells Me \nSo (Karslake, 2007) than watching Normal (Busch et al., 2003).  One possibility for this is that it \npresents value-laden material and intense scenes of both support and hatred for the LGBTQ \ncommunities.  Additionally, students may respond more to documentaries (e.g., For the Bible \nTells Me So) than fictional portrayals (e.g., Normal) with recognizable, cisgender actors who are \nnot from the LGBTQ communities.  Notably, after watching these films class discussions \nevolved from how to avoid imposing personal views on LGBTQ clients, to how to avoid \nimposing personal views on those who are not accepting or welcoming of members of the \nLGBTQ communities, thus promoting ethical counseling practices (ACA, 2014).  The authors \nsuggest counselor educators use class discussions to process emotions triggered by images seen \nin the films and guide students through the process of turning emotions and new awareness into \neffective counseling interventions when working with clients (Arthur & Achenbach, 2002; Dave \n& Tandon, 2011; Higgins & Dermer, 2002; Oh et al., 2012; Warren et al., 2010; Whipple & \nTucker, 2012).  This guidance models for students how counselors can help clients with the same \nskills in regulating emotions, synthesizing new information with previously held beliefs, and \neffective decision making skills aimed toward beneficial counseling outcomes. \n More participants reported an increased awareness after watching Busch’s et al., (2003) \nNormal than watching For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007).  Prior to watching Normal, \nsome participants stated they did not know much about the transgender community, which could \nsuggest why there was a larger increase in awareness as compared to responses after watching \nFor the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007), where all participants reported knowledge and/or \nexperiences with lesbian and gay individuals.  There were fewer counseling applications \nreported, however, after watching Normal.  It is possible participants needed more time to \nsynthesize their emotional reactions and new awareness of experiences faced by transgender \nindividuals and their families before identifying possible counseling interventions and best \npractices (Chavez-Korell & Johnson, 2010; Villalba & Redmond, 2008).  Counselor educators \ncan expand students’ awareness into transferable counseling interventions by using class \ndiscussions, skills-based training, and other experiential activities such as role-plays, community \ninterviews, and discussion panels that include transgender individuals (Long & Serovich, 2003; \nPearson, 2003; Preston, 2011).  Additionally, students can have class discussions and \nassignments to increase their knowledge about local and national support networks (Carroll et \nal., 2002; Chavez-Korell & Johnson, 2010), community resources, and psychoeducational \nmaterials they can provide clients.  This may include information on the transition process, \ncoming out to family, friends, co-workers, and the community, and acknowledging the outcome \nmay not be as positive as the ending in Normal, and what interventions could be taken to address \nloss and grief. \nImplications for Counselor Educators \n It is important for counselor educators to understand that the students comprising their \nclasses can range from ultra conservative to extremely liberal in their values related to marriage, \nfamily, religion, and politics and these values may be deeply entrenched depending upon the \nenvironment in which they were raised and educated.  And, it is important that students feel safe \nto share their ideas and life experiences by hearing from counselor educators that all perspectives \nare valued, ridicule from others is not acceptable in the classroom, and that students have \nadditional support (e.g., speaking with the professor, other faculty, or support services) if they \nneed to process what they experience in class discussions.  Thus, whether using the \naforementioned material in a class devoted strictly to teaching about LGBTQ issues or \nincorporating it into an existing class (e.g., cross cultural), the authors have found the following \npractice helpful in increasing the likelihood that the purpose of showing and processing these \nfilms is more easily understood and fully considered.  First, ask students to briefly write about \nsituations when they were unfairly judged or ridiculed.  Then ask students to write about \nsituations when they unfairly judged or ridiculed others, even if they were quite young at the \ntime.  Once students complete these two brief written assignments, ask them to discuss their \ninsights and how this may relate to learning about LGBTQ clients and their issues.  The authors \nhave found that this exercise tends to decrease potential defenses and preconceived notions \nstudents may harbor about LGBTQ client issues by appealing to the larger argument that \njudgment in general, at least for professional counselors, is typically not conducive to successful \nclient outcomes.   \n The authors also have found it useful to make students aware that the class may be filled \nwith students who have a wide range of potentially conflicting beliefs and values related to \nreligion, politics, abortion, right to die, and LGBTQ issues, among many other topics, but a part \nof the responsibility of being a graduate student is to be able to rationally and intentionally \nconsider issues from multiple perspectives so that tentative decisions can be based on a broad \nbody of knowledge, not just opinion.  And, it should be mentioned that thinking systemically \ndoes not necessarily mean they have to sacrifice their values, unless with new evidence they see \nfit to do so.  Moreover, discussions should include how to effectively and ethically work with \nclients whom students hold negative impressions or beliefs by seeking supervision and additional \ntraining to prevent harming the client and counseling relationship (ALGBTIC, 2013).  Using \nthese strategies to position or “front-end-load” the purpose of viewing and processing these two \nfilms does not guarantee that students will engage in completely peaceful and respectful \ndiscussion, but the authors have found that it reduces defenses to the point where productive \ndiscussion can be facilitated. \nLimitations and Directions for Future Research \n Although this study provides insight into how the use of experiential teaching methods \nmay enhance counselor-in-training competency with LGBTQ clients, it is not without \nlimitations.  One limitation of this study was the use of a convenience sample that lacked \ndiversity which may have biased the results.  Additional limitations that could be addressed in \nfuture research include assessing the effectiveness of these films in more than two sexuality \ncourses, comparing films with members of the LGBTQ communities (e.g., bisexual, queer) that \nwere not included in this study, assessing students’ comfort and skill levels in working with \nLGTBQ clients while practicing in a counseling lab after watching films, and comparing various \nexperiential activities to determine the most effective method (e.g., films, role-plays, group \nactivities, etc.) in increasing students’ cultural competence in working with LGBTQ clients.  In \naddition, field studies need to be conducted to determine if students who view these two films \nbuild stronger therapeutic alliance with LGBTQ clients, the key ingredient to successful client \noutcome, relative to students who are taught with other types of sensitivity training modalities.  \nConclusion \n At its most fundamental level, the role of the counseling profession is to help clients live \nmore authentic and meaningful lives in accordance with clients’ own values and goals.  \nCounselor educators can play a pivotal role in this process by continually seeking effective \nteaching methods that expand counselors-in-training awareness of personal biases.  The use of \ntwo films, specifically For the Bible Tells Me So (Karslake, 2007) and Normal (Busch et al., \n2003), have proven useful as an experiential teaching method in a sexuality course.  The authors \nhope in presenting these findings is that the impact of using these films increases students’ \nawareness and fosters their growth as effective counselors for members of LGBTQ communities.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n References \n \nAhn, D., Jin, S.

    "abstract": "There is a dearth of research on effective strategies for teaching counselors-in-training how to work more effectively with LGBTQ clients. Experiential learning activities, such as watching films, can increase students’ knowledge of their attitudes and beliefs about themselves and culturally diverse clients. This qualitative study explored, in the context of a sexuality and counseling course, how 27 students’ awareness, knowledge, and skills were influenced by the use of two films, For the Bible Tells Me So and Normal, which illuminate the experiences of LGBTQ individuals and their families. Results and implications for counselor educators are provided",
