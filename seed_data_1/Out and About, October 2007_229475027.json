Like \nmarriage contracts, the \"brotherments\" had to be \nsworn before a notary and witnesses, Tulchin \nexplained. \n  continued on page 2\n    The same type of legal contract of the time also\ncould provide the foundation for a variety of non-\nnuclear households, including arrangements in \nwhich two or more biological brothers inherited the\nfamily home from their parents and would continue\nto live together, Tulchin said. \n     But non-relatives also used the contracts. In \ncases that involved single, unrelated men, Tulchin \nargues, these contracts provide “considerable \nevidence that the affrèrés were using affrèrements \nto formalize same-sex loving relationships.\" \n     The ins-and-outs of the medieval relationships \nare tricky at best to figure out. \n     “I suspect that some of these relationships were \nsexual, while others may not have been,\" Tulchin \nsaid. \"It is impossible to prove either way and \nprobably also somewhat irrelevant to understanding \ntheir way of thinking.

The HEI is a new annual survey launched by HRC's Family Project and the \nGay and Lesbian Medical Association that looks at how hospitals are responding to five areas of \ngreatest concern to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender patients: patient non-discrimination, \nvisitation, medical decision-making, cultural competency training for staff, and employment \npolicies.  \nThe full report can found at:  http://www.hrc.org/documents/HEI_Report_Oct_1_2007.pdf. \nFor more than a decade, state and local governments have been establishing legal mechanisms \nfor the recognition of same-sex couples. Whether referred to as “domestic partnerships,” “civil \nunions,” or “reciprocal beneficiaries,” many of these programs provide registrants with the right \nto visit their partners at hospitals. As of July 2007, the following eleven jurisdictions have some \nform of relationship recognition for same-sex couples:  \nCalifornia - Statewide domestic partnership registration available since 1999  \nConnecticut - Statewide civil unions available since 2005  \nDistrict of Columbia - Domestic partnership registration available since 2002  \nHawaii - Statewide reciprocal beneficiaries registration available since 1997  \nMaine - Statewide domestic partnership registration available since 2004  \nMassachusetts - Statewide marriage available since 2004  \nNew Hampshire - Statewide civil unions available effective 2008  \nNew Jersey - Statewide civil unions available since 2007  \nOregon - Statewide domestic partnership registration available effective 2008  \nVermont - Statewide civil unions available effective 2000  \nWashington - Statewide domestic partnership registration available since 2007  \nIn a 2007 poll, \n89 percent \nof Americans \nreported that \nthey believe gay \npeople should \nhave equal \nrights in job \nopportunities. \nPage 3 of 8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHomosexual behavior in the \nanimal kingdom has been \nscientifically observed among \nbirds, beetles, sheep, dolphins,\norangutans, penguins, \nostriches, macaques, and \nbonobos, to name just a few \nspecies.

The average lifespan \nis about 30 years.  \nArticle retrieved from Sky News at \nhttp://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,30100\n-1266787,00.html \nWWT spokeswoman Jane Waghorn \nsaid: \"Fernando and Carlos are a \nsame sex couple who have been \nknown to steal other Flamingos' eggs \nby chasing them off their nest \nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21113678/ \nENDA debate sign of Congress', public's gay comfort \nlevel\u001f \n     The final version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act is not likely to \ninclude transgender protections -- a reality that reflects where many members of \nCongress and the public stand on LGBT issues: They are aware of issues facing \ngays and lesbians, but not in tune -- yet -- with the problems of transgender \npeople, according to this article. LGBT activists have two weeks to lobby \nlawmakers to include transgender workers in the bill, according to out U.S. Rep. \nBarney Frank, D-Mass., ENDA's chief sponsor. \nPage 4 of 8 \n So You Want to Fight for Equality?  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     We are living in a time like no other for gay, \nlesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) \nAmericans. Never have the stakes been so high, and \nnever have the opportunities for real change been \nwithin our reach.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     The current generation is smart, driven and \ndynamic — and, straight or gay, they are more \naccepting of difference, and GLBT people in \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticular, than any generation before them.  There is \na wonderful world ahead if only we can outlive the \nbias, ignorance, and prejudice that have riddled our \nnation for decades. But wait it out?  No way!  There \nare many things you can do right now that would \nhave MAJOR IMPACT in helping to eradicate the \nvestiges of bias in your community, your state, your \nCongress, and your country.  \n     This is the generation that experienced Matthew \nShepard left to die on a fence in the middle of a \nWyoming prairie. These are the young people who \nhave grown up understanding that labels belong on \nrecords, not on people.  And we have all helped to \nbring our nation many miles along the path of \nfreedom and equality. More than three decades after \nStonewall, GLBT Americans are still standing \nproud, day after day, working at all levels to achieve \nequality. The gains are clear. Still, the journey to full \nequality is far from over.   \n     Until Americans can be safe at work and at home, \nuntil the HIV/AIDS crisis is over, and until civil \nmarriage equality is a reality in this country, it is up \nto ordinary citizens to use their voices and work for \nchange.   \nWhat You Can Do - GLBT Americans have made \nmany gains, but none were won without the hard \nwork of ordinary citizens with extraordinary voices. \nEvery time someone comes out of the closet, reports \na hate crime to police, joins a GLBT advocacy \ngroup, telephones a member of Congress to ask for \nsupport on legislation, or writes a letter to the editor, \nour community makes progress. Pointing to the \npower of individuals, the Dalai Lama said, “Since \nperiods of great change, such as the present one, \ncome so rarely in human history, it is up to each of \nus to make the best use of our time to help create a \nhappier world.”  \n     Won’t you consider becoming a part of the \nchange you’d like to see in the world? Are you ready \nto stand up and be counted?  \nSpeak Out! Activist Tools for GLBT Equality \nIs it right … \n¾ that families headed by same-sex couples \nare denied the basic protections taken for \ngranted by opposite-sex couples?   \n¾ that same-sex couples are taxed on domestic \npartner benefits? And that they’re taxed \nmore than opposite-sex couples on jointly \nowned property and on inherited retirement \nplans?  \n¾ that a gay survivor cannot receive his or her \npartner’s Social Security death benefit, no \nmatter how long their relationship?  \n¾ that there is no fundamental guarantee of \nhospital visitation or family leave in the \nevent of illness?  \n¾ that GLBT Americans cannot sponsor a \nsame-sex partner from another country for a \ngreen card, thus tearing many families \napart?    \n     There are more than 1,000 rights, benefits and \nresponsibilities on the federal level that married \ncouples enjoy, as well as several hundred on the \nstate level. The time for full equality is now.  \nSpreading the Word - It’s been said that if every \ngay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person \nsuddenly turned purple, the very next day we’d have \nequal rights. Why? Because people would realize \nthat someone they know and love is gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, or transgender — and that’s how hearts \nand minds are changed. Knowledge shatters \nstereotypes. And polling backs this up: People who \nhave a family member, a friend, a co-worker or an \nacquaintance who is openly gay, lesbian, bisexual or \ntrans-gender are more likely to support equal rights. \n     Coming out to yourself and to other people is an \nimportant step for any GLBT person. It’s also the \nfirst step toward being political.  \n                                                 Continued on page 6 \n \n “Evil triumphs when good \nmen do nothing.” \n  Edmund Burke (1729-1797) \nPage 5 of 8 \nSpeak Out!  Activist Tools – continued from page 5\n \n \n \n \n     It’s important to know when to speak up. You \ndon’t have to find a way to work gay issues into \nevery conversation. But be on the lookout for \nteachable moments.   \n \n \n \n \n \n     Visit HRC’s National Coming Out Project on the \nweb at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwho are passionate about civil rights are great places \nto post information about legislation, events and \nhow to take action. If you have a blog, make sure to \nmention online activism. If you read and comment \non someone else’s blog, do the same. \nAdvocating for Public Policy with Elected \nOfficials - Every time another governor issues an \nexecutive order to offer domestic partner benefits to \nstate employees, another city council votes to ban \ndiscrimination based on gender identity, or another \ncongressperson agrees to co-sponsor a bill, there is \nat least one ordinary constituent who can take credit \nfor helping to make it happen. Change does not \noccur in a vacuum. Only by speaking out for \nequality do we begin to see gains for our \ncommunity. \n \nwww.hrc.org/ncop for more information \nabout coming out and to download the Resource \nGuide to Coming Out and to learn about coming out \nin communities of color.  \n \n     There are many opportunities to come out:  \nCome out to family and friends - The most \nimportant conversations to be had are with family \nand friends — people who are close to us and will \nlisten to what we have to say.  \nCome out to co-workers - Co-workers often talk \nabout weekend plans around the water cooler. If you \nare safe at work, why not mention that your \nweekend plans include a same-sex partner or gay \nfriend or family member. (Obviously, you need to \nknow first that your employer has a policy or your \nstate has a law against sexual orientation or gender \nidentity discrimination. Visit www.hrc.org/worknet \nto find out.) \nCome out to clergy - If you attend a place of \nworship, make your views known to the religious \nleaders, as well as others who attend. Many \ndenominations are struggling with the issue of \nblessing same-sex unions as well as GLBT equal \nrights, while others have already made decisions.   \nCome out to community - If you attend meetings or \ngroups where fair-minded, GLBT or allied people \nare likely to congregate, tell them about your work \nfor GLBT equality and invite them to participate \nwith you in the discussion.  \nCome out on the Internet - The Internet has \nrevolutionized the way we communicate. If you \nspend time in chat rooms, talk about your views on \nequal rights and enlist people to get involved with \nHRC’s Online Action Center at \nwww.hrc.org/actioncenter and Million For Marriage \n— www.millionformarriage.org.  \nLetters and letter-writing campaigns - Due to the \nvolume of faxes and e-mails that members of \nCongress receive, a handwritten letter carries more \nweight than ever. Some representatives and senators \nhave told their staffs they want to see every \nhandwritten letter that comes into the office. So \nwhile it takes extra effort, hand writing a letter vastly \nincreases the likelihood that your elected official \nwill actually see your message. \nE-mail and HRC’s Online Action Center - Through \nHRC’s Online Action Center at \nwww.hrc.org/actioncenter, you can send a fax or an \ne-mail with the click of a button to your state or \nfederal elected officials. You can also sign up to \nreceive action alerts about breaking legislation and \nnews.  Tell your friends about HRC’s Online Action \nCenter!  \nPhone calls and phone-in days - Especially on days \nwhen a vote on legislation is imminent, a phone call \ncan make a great impact. Keep it short. Introduce \nyourself as a constituent, be prepared to give your \naddress, and tell the person who answers the phone \nthat you’re calling to urge the elected official to vote \nyes or no on the particular legislation.  \nLobby visits - Any citizen can seek a meeting, or \nlobby visit, with his or her members of Congress. In-\ndistrict (local) lobbying visits are one key to \nadvancing gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender \nequality. They put a face to the issue — the face of a \nconstituent, or someone who also has the power to \nvote for or against the legislator. Visit \nwww.hrc.org/actioncenter to learn how to set up and \nexecute an effective lobby visit.  \n                                                  Continued on page 7 \n     If you belong to e-mail lists, try including a blurb \nabout GLBT equal rights in your signature, with \nlinks to HRC’s Online Action Center and Million \nFor Marriage. Likewise, Internet bulletin boards that \ndiscuss issues of interest to GLBT people and people \n        Page    6 of 8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpeak Out!  Activist Tools – continued from page 6\n \nTown hall meetings - Town hall meetings are \nexcellent forums to educate and ACTIVATE people \naround an issue or legislation. They’re a great way \nto bring a diverse group of people together to learn \nand talk about an issue and how they can take \naction. Town hall meetings can vary widely in \nformat and content, but they should be free and open \nto the public. Contact HRC’s field organizers if you \nare interested in a town hall meeting in your area. E-\nmail field@hrc.org.  \nCandidate meet-and-greets - One of the best ways \nto introduce a new or incumbent candidate to voters \nis to organize a candidate meet-and-greet. These \nevents are not fundraisers — rather, they are a \nchance for candidates to meet the people they would \nlike to represent (or, if they’re seeking re-election, \nthe people they already represent). They are free and \nusually held in a private home. If you would like to \norganize a meet-and-greet in your area, contact \nHRC’s field organizers at field@hrc.org.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRallies and marches - Visibility events such as \nrallies and marches are excellent opportunities to \nenergize large groups of people and to get your \nmessage out in the media. Read the local GLBT \nnewspaper or visit GLBT websites to learn when \nsuch events are planned. Or get involved and help \nplan one yourself!  \nPetitions - Petitions can be an effective way to let \nelected officials know that a large group of people \ncare about an issue. And they can be useful for \nletting people know about an issue and soliciting \nthem to get more involved. \nVoter registration drives - Voters who identify as \ngay, lesbian or bisexual in exit polling typically \nmake up about 5 percent of the electorate — a \nsignificant proportion that has made the difference \nin many close races. That’s why it’s so important \nthat GLBT and allied voters are registered, because \nin most states you can’t vote if you aren’t registered. \nOrganizing a voter registration drive is something \nthat everyone can do, and HRC is here to help you. \nFor a voter registration kit, e-mail HRC’s field \norganizers at field@hrc.org. You can also hold a \n“virtual registration campaign” online using HRC’s \nOnline Voter Registration form at \nwww.hrc.org/actioncenter.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWorking on Political Campaigns - Anyone can \nvolunteer for a candidate or campaign. You can \nmake phone calls, organize fund-raising events, go \ndoor-to-door, help people get to the polls — the list \nof jobs that a campaign needs to have done is \nenormous! Creativity is essential, and perseverance \nis vital. If you are committed, hard-working and \nreliable, you are the kind of volunteer that all \ncampaigns need. No one person can do it all — \neveryone can make a difference! \nCandidate elections - HRC’s nonpartisan PAC \nmakes financial and in-kind contributions to fair-\nminded candidates running for Senate and the House \nof Representatives. For more information about \nHRC’s PAC and endorsed candidates, visit \nwww.hrc.org/pac.  \nBallot measure campaigns - In states that have the \ninitiative or referendum process, voters can put \nissues on the ballot if enough sign petitions. HRC \nworks to pass pro-GLBT ballot measures and to \ndefeat anti-GLBT ballot measures. Right-wing \nactivists have often been successful in using the \ninitiative process to deny equal rights to GLBT \npeople.
