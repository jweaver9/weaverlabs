He sat comfortably behind his desk, soaking up the sunlight beaming in from the window right beside him.As Cohen looked out-side to the students walking by Seventh Street Plaza, he recalled the day that Director of Choral Activities, Jeffrey Benson sought his approval to adapt two of the choir courses in the music department.“My response to him was, ‘It is about time,’” Cohen said.In 2017, Benson decid-ed to rebrand the Men’s Glee Club as the “Spartan Glee Club,” and the Women’s Chorus as the “Treble Choir.”Though he knew the tweak had to go through the school’s curriculum committee, Benson said he didn’t expect any con-troversy to arise. As it turned out, there were no objections to his proposal.“No one ever made a thing of it,” Benson said. “I think that’s why it went unnoticed by people out-side of the music depart-ment for so long.”The modification was approved by the commit-tee, but Benson still had to wait one year before he could see his efforts materialize. SJSU’s course catalog and class syllabus for that year had already been published.Cohen explained that renaming classes in the course catalog would be a lengthy process, but it was imperative to him that the course adequately recog-nize all of its students.“The catalog change was necessary since many stu-dents see the class name for the first time through the catalog,” said Cohen. Seemingly every human characteristic that people have no control over before they are born is controversial. Before birth, you were not asked what color you wanted your skin to be, yet racism exists. You were not asked what religion you wanted to practice, yet religious discrimination exists. You were not asked what gender you wanted to be, yet misogyny and misandry still exist.If you’ve watched the news and you live in the United States, you probably know that women and non-binary individuals are under attack in this country. Whether it’s in the state of Missouri where only one abortion clinic remains open in the state, or in Washington D.C., where the president has attempted to change laws and restrict the rights of LGBTQ people, there is no equality.Maybe I have been naive, but I never expected gender to be such a controversial topic. As a white male, it has been easy to disregard many of these issues on the news because they do not apply to me. However, that is no longer the case.   No matter what gender you choose to identify as, we are all human. It is imperative we fight together against anyone who degrades someone because of the way they identify. If we let this issue continue to proliferate, the repercussions will continue to grow.The Spartan Daily staff chose the theme of gender for this special issue because we noticed a negative trend in our country that needs to change. The staff has worked hard all semester to inform our readers about human rights issues currently happening around the world and we continue to discuss those matters.  In this special edition of the Spartan Daily, we delve into the ways gender is treated in the workplace, in legislature, and in pop culture.     According to the San Jose State University Executive Summary from spring 2016, 60.7 percent of the student body identified as female, 36 percent identified as male and 3.3 percent identified as non-binary.We cannot afford to continue to antagonize women and we have to put an end to the jokes that attack the LGBTQ community. More than half of our country’s population identifies as something other than male. The time for change is now.Music professor ditches gender in course titlesBy Vicente VeraSTAFF WRITER“We don’t want students to be discouraged from taking the class because their gender identity is not recognized in the title of the class.”As of fall 2017, Benson’s class syllabus for MUSC 51 and MUSC 151 no longer contain any references to gender.“Your voice and singing are a part of your identity, and the art form can be really personal,” Benson said. “We don’t want the name of the class to carry a negative connotation.”Before Benson made his idea known to the music department, Cohen was already warming up to the idea of forgoing gender exclusivity in class titles because of his own experiences.“Our department has hosted a recurring work-shop for local high school music students called ‘Real Men Sing’, and in an attempt to be more inclu-sive, we wanted to put together a similar work-shop for female students,” Cohen said.Cohen soon realized that replacing the word “men” to “women” in the name of the workshop would not read as well as the original classes’ title.The title of “Real Men Sing” is intended to be a play on the assumption that men don’t sing in choirs, therefore switch-ing the genders would also do away with the title’s original meaning.“Obviously, there was no way we could use that title and have it make any sense,” he said with a chuckle.During a faculty duty day on campus last year, Cohen participat-ed in a workshop that required participants to wear name tags with their preferred pronouns attached to them.“Those nametags really instilled in me that we should care about how people wish to be referred to, it matters,” he said.Many of the students enrolled in Benson’s men’s Choir class were vocally supportive of the change when it was announced in spring of 2017.“[Benson] is a pretty friendly guy. He always keeps the class in the loop on the things he’s doing,” said music senior Kevin Schoenfeld. “I’m happy about doing away with gender in music class titles, it’s harder to do that with some subjects.”Music composition senior Natalie Jessop played bass in the choir and she had anticipat-ed the name change when she heard rumors about it.“I didn’t know it was a thing until I actually saw it on the roster,” she said. “It was really nice to see that there is now recogni-tion that women sing bass in choir too.”Benson said though the process to amend a course name wasn’t a particularly difficult one, he is extremely happy the School of Music and Dance carried out the change.“College is already such a stressful experience for a lot of people and we want to do everything we can to accommodate all students.”VICENTE VERA | SPARTAN DAILYDirector of Choral Activities Jeﬀ rey Benson conducts his Spartan Glee Club class, formally titled “Men’s Choir,” on Nov. 12 in the San Jose State University Music Building.BEN STEINMANAGING EDITOR EDITOR’S NOTEWe don’t want students to be discouraged from taking the class because their gender identity is not recognized in the title of the class.

SJSU has 13 engineering disciplines offered, of which only three have a proportionate gender representation in class.T h o u g h  f e m a l e representation is rare in this college, women taking night classes are far more disproportionate.Civil engineering senior Crystal Perez said she feels unsafe every time she attends her night classes. “As women in engineering we don’t have much of a choice because some sections are only offered after 6 p.m., because our professor comes to lecture after work,” Perez said. Sheryl Ehrman, dean of the engineering department, said their department considers scheduling including availability of instructors, classrooms and labs for their undergraduate and graduate classes in the evening. However, she says security is a concern for all of their students in evening classes.“While the original ‘Evening Guide’ program was specifically intended for female students to be escorted around campus, male students also take advantage of it to ensure their safety,” University Police Department Lt. Michael Santos said. According to the UPD’s Records Unit, for the period of Aug. 1, 2017 to Aug. 1, 2018, there were 1,583 requests for escorts from females and 113 requests from males.  Women were 14 times more likely than men to request safety services.Though various robberies, kidnaps, shooting and bomb threats have happened in the SJSU campus, the UPD ensures the safety of each student.Santos said their responsibi l ity UPD’s the safety of the campus community, property and the surrounding community at all times.  The Campus Safety Plan states, “As a ‘city within a city,’ the university is committed to safeguarding members of the campus community as well as the large and growing number of visitors who come to the campus year-round.” The Safety Escort and Safe Ride programs offered by UPD allow students to safely get from class to class or from school to home.Civil engineering senior Juan Bermudez takes a night class because it is the only section offered. He said it would be better if it was earlier.“In my class there’s only one girl. I think women take classes during the day because it’s bright and so it’s assumed to be safer,” Bermudez said.Though night classes tend to help students achieve their degrees faster and more conveniently, it is concerning to students.Ehrman believes students attending classes together can also help increase safety when walking alone.  Perez said she has taken multiple night classes before. She has no choice and has learned to stay aware and safe. “I take these classes because they are the only sections offered for these engineering courses,” she said. “I usually have a friend walk with me,” she added.Students attending night classes learn to stay aware of their surroundings, especially women.  Fewer women take night classesAs women in engineering we don’t have much of a choice due to sections only being offered after 6 p.m., our professor comes to lecture after work.Crystal Perez civil engineering seniorBy Nora RamirezSTAFF WRITERWomen made history at the polls on Election Day. Hundreds of women nationwide ran for public office, and many won their races. Now, a record number of women will serve in the 116th Congress.San Jose State University accounting and women, gender and sexuality studies senior Kristen Flaten said she’s “incredibly proud” to see so many women elected to Congress. “Representation has a large impact on folks,” Flaten said. “Also, the fact that we now have openly queer and Native elected officials is something that many people thought they wouldn’t see in their lifetime.”News outlets including CNN and The New York Times have projected at least 102 women will hold seats in the House of Representatives. Of that number, 36 are serving in Congress for the first time. While four races were still undecided as of Monday, this is a historic number. Right now, only 88 out of 435 representatives in the House are women, according to the Congressional Research Service.Collectively, women made history by the sheer number of them voters elected to the House. Several women also broke other barriers. At 29 years old, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman to ever be elected to Congress. She will represent New York’s 14th District when the next session of Congress begins on Jan. 3. Ocasio-Cortez made headlines during the primary election when she ousted ten-term Democrat Joe Crowley.“There’s so many people Follow Sarah on Twitter@sarah_klievesWomen make waves at the pollsBy Sarah KlievesONLINE EDITORthat know that we’re going into the lion’s den, even within the party,” Ocasio-Cortez told The New York Times.Tanya Saroj Bakhru, SJSU associate professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, said one of the biggest challenges Ocasio-Cortez may face is opposition to change. “Election to office is a challenge to the status quo,” Bakhru said. She added it is “really encouraging and exciting that there were so many firsts” in the election, but there is “still lots of work we have to do to make sure that there’s fair representation in the government so the population of the United States is reflected in those officials elected to office.”Some progress was made in that regard. Several women of color became the first to be elected to the House. Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar became the first Muslim women to serve in the House. Both formerly served in their respective state House of Representatives.Representat ive-e lec t Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland will be the first Native American women to serve in the House.Davids is only one of a handful of Congressional representatives who identifies as part of the LGBT community. She will represent District 3 Kansas. Haaland will represent District 1 in New Mexico.SJSU political science professor James Brent said seeing these victories is important for two reasons. “Having a Congress that looks more like America is important because it means that there will be a more diverse range of ideas brought to bear on important national problems,” Brent said. “In addition, both children and adults from traditionally u n d e r r e p r e s e n t e d groups will now have an easier time envisioning themselves running and winning elections, meaning this trend is only likely to accelerate.”In two states, voters elected women to the Senate for the first time.In Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn became the state’s first Senator-elect. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema beat Republican challenger Martha McSally in the race for the late Senator John McCain’s seat, which is currently held by Senator Jeff Flake. It was a close race and the results weren’t announced until six days after the election.That race isn’t the only one that is too close to call and a winner has yet to be declared. In Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams held on for nearly three weeks before ending her bid for governor. Abrams ran against former Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who oversaw the election. Had she won, Abrams would have become the nation’s first black female governor. She would have also become one of just a handful of women to hold the highest office at a state level. Abrams gave a speech ending her bid on Friday, but would not call it a concession speech and alluded to what some have called voter d i s e n f r a n c h i s e m e n t by Kemp.“Make no mistake, the former secretary of state was deliberate and intentional in his actions,” Abrams said. “I know that eight years of systemic d i s e n f r a n c h i s e m e n t , disinvestment and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia.”According to the Georgia Secretary of State’s website, as of Sunday with 100 percent of precincts are reporting, the apparent winner is Kemp with 50.22 percent or 1,978,408 votes. Abrams got 48.83 percent or 1,923,685 votes. For weeks, the votes were too close to call a winner and a federal judge even ordered a delay in the certification of the race, according to The New York Times. In her decision, Judge Amy Totenberg cited concerns over Georgia’s voter registration system and how state election officials handled provisional ballots.Bringing the election results closer to home, The Washington Post reports California had 35 female candidates running in midterm races. Eighteen of them won, 14 lost and three are still undecided. Among those candidates was California Senator Dianne Feinstein. She has served in the Senate since 1992 and was re-elected in a “battleground” race against state senator and Democrat Kevin de León. The number of women headed to Capitol Hill is leading some news outlets to call this election year the second “Year of the Woman.” The first was in 1992 when voters sent 24 women to represent them on Capitol Hill – more than any previous decade. Bakhru said she’s hesitant to agree with that statement. “It’s awesome that there are so many more women running for office and participating in government,” Bakhru said.But she believes it is “important to continue to sustain political engagement on behalf of gender and racial minorities. We can’t stop supporting those people just because they’ve been elected.”SOURCE: CNN, NEW YORK TIMES, INFOGRAPHIC BY SARAH KLIEVESFollow Nora on Twitter@noraramirez27SOURCE: UPD’S RECORDS UNIT, INFOGRAPHIC BY NORA RAMIREZ, MELISA YURIAR, HUAN XUN CHANRequests for UPD escortsFrom Aug.1, 2017to Aug. 1, 2018• 1,583 escorts for women• 113 escorts for menNEWSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 20184Members of the LGBTQ community jumped into action on Sunday, Oct. 21, when The New York Times released a leaked memo from the Trump administration, implying that the transgender community would be defined out of existence.“The Monday after hearing the news, there was just a point where I couldn’t work anymore,” activist and community co-director of Microsoft’s LGBT Employee Resource Group, Sera Fernando said. The memo proposed that gender would be narrowly defined as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth, The New York Times reported. The decision would put the health protections of the transgender community at risk as it could eliminate federal protections for all gender identities under the Affordable Care Act.According to The Commonwealth Fund, in 2016, the federal government extended anti-discriminatory rules under the act thus prohibiting healthcare providers and insurance companies that receive federal funding from discriminating against transgender people. According to the director of the California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network Amanda Wallner, the proposals in the leaked memo would provide leverage for healthcare providers to continue denying transgender patients, many who as of right now already have to fight these denials by going through an independent medical review process.“We’re brought up in the ways of a heteronormative society, and doctors, just like most people, can inherit certain ideas of transphobia or homophobia,” The LGBTQ Youth Space drop-in center coordinator, Stanley Gaeta said.California’s Department of Managed Healthcare released a Director’s Letter in 2013 that would allow transgender people to access the department’s Independent Medical Review process if a health plan denied service or treatment, removing the classification of transition-related care as a coverage exclusively ineligible for the review. “It’s really scary, transgender folk in California and throughout the county were rightfully very nervous on what the memo might mean,” Wallner said. “But we have very strong state protection that would stand regardless of what the federal government said.” Fernando, who graduated from San Jose State University in 2008 with a degree in radio, television and film, organized Silicon Valley Pride’s first Trans and Friends Rally on Aug. 25 as well as the #WontBeErased rally in response to the memo on Oct. 23. “I’ve always wanted to be an activist and I’ve always wanted to share my story, as someone who identifies as intersectional,” Fernando said. “Not only am I trans, I’m also queer, very queer, I identify as pansexual, Filipina, I don’t necessarily have any religious affiliation, I consider myself very middle class.” Intersectionality is defined as a way of looking at one’s identity and its relationship with power, reflecting intersections of race, sex, economic class, gender identity, ability and more, according to The Washington Post.As an employee at Microsoft, Fernando receives health benefits under the company’s t r ans ge n d e r- i n c lu s ive healthcare coverage plan.“For folks to be able to fit in with society, how they choose to present themselves is a very personal journey,” Fernando said. “For me Microsoft paid for it, privileged right? But for people who don’t work in tech, those work in the arts, for the government or work for themselves, access to this healthcare, they have to spend so much just to live as their authentic self and to me that’s not fair.” Prior to the memo, the House of Representatives passed the American Healthcare Act on May 4, a plan that would undermine the Medi-Cal expansion and Covered California, which expands healthcare to more than 6 million Californians. According the California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network, the proposal threatens to stop the progress in improving LGBTQ health disparities achieved with the Affordable Care Act, which allowed the LGBTQ community to have  coverage for cancer screenings, HIV and STI testing, substance use treatment and other preventive care. Besides economic b a r r i e r s ,  T h e Commonwealth Fund reports that only 40 percent of trans people report disclosing their gender identity to their medical providers. Out of that number, half of them reported on their providers having a lack of training on transgender healthcare needs.“From the voices that I’ve heard, a lot of the time transgender folk are educating their healthcare providers,” Gaeta said. “In healthcare environments that’s one of the main things that are interesting to see because you go to them to seek services about health, seeking professionals.” The California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network, though it provides a guarantee for healthcare in the state to protect the transgender community from discrimination, finds challenges in the ability for transgender folk to find doctors, therapists or surgeons who are familiar with their needs.“It’s a big problem to tackle, there are a number By Winona RajamohanSTAFF WRITERFollow Winona on Twitter@winonarjmhWomen struggle for equality in technology industryBy Huan Xun ChanSTAFF WRITERThough there are more women joining the technology field, gender disparity in the industry is still evident in the statistics. According to the National Center for Women & Information Technology, women made up only 26 percent of the computing workforce in 2017. When men are sitting together and talking about their interests in gaming, sports and high-end technology, IBM Hybrid Cloud Senior Offering Manager Juanita Dion-Chiang said it is actually very hard for women to feel included. “Women never say no but that doesn’t mean they fit in,” Dion-Chiang said. Coming from a computer and software engineering background, Dion-Chiang has worked in program management at IBM for six years. “Women in the technology industry are constantly being reminded that they are women through different ways such as body gestures and opportunities,” she said.According to Catalyst, a nonprofit organization focused on promoting inclusive workplaces for women, work experiences such as isolation, hostile male-dominated work environments and ineffective executive feedback, negatively impact women who work in science, engineering and technology industries and eventually leave their jobs. In the United States, about one-third of women in the aforementioned industries intend to leave their careers within a year, according to Catalyst.“We as women have three responsibilities – ourselves, our husbands and our children – which are incredibly heavy and pressured,” Dion-Chiang said.In fall 2017, female students made up 23 percent engineering and computer science majors at San Jose State University, according to SJSU Office of Institutional Effectiveness & Analytics.“Definitely, female students are as capable and confident as most students are, but they are just less represented,” Darpan Goyal, Director of Student Engagement & Co-Founder of SJ Hacks said.SJ Hacks, a student organization dedicated to organizing Hackathons, collaborated with IBM to organize “Women in Tech” workshop. This was held not only to bring technology experts to campus, but also to bring female students together in an environment which allows them to share their achievements and frustrations with other peers. The workshop attracted female students and San Jose female residents. Eighty percent of the participants were women, according to SJ Hacks.“Events like this will help females feel that they are being recognized and seen as one of the important parts of the technology culture in Silicon Valley. We must keep motivating them and ensure that they know they are as capable as males,” Goyal said.Computer engineering graduate student Rishika Machina showed her passion for data science at the workshop.“It’s very challenging, you have to work for it and you have to prove yourself,” Machina said. “At the end of the day, when you complete a code or program, you will feel happy and you’ll discover that you really are capable of doing anything.” Machina added that the challenge posed to women is how to sustain a job in this field. “When I am doing projects, I see that females are assigned less important and productive parts compared to males,” she said.As a woman in the engineering industry, Dion-Chiang said she hopes to reverse an unfair situation. “We are being promoted based on our performances whereas men are promoted based on their potential. I would like to bring that to a reverse,” Dion-Chiang said. “I want women to show the world that we have potential, and for men to show us their support.”She added that women should not be judged by how they dress up and how they do their makeup. It is more important for people to pay attention to a woman’s intelligence and the ways they share information.HUAN XUN CHAN | SPARTAN DAILYDespite women being the minority in the tech industry, 80 percent of the participants at the “Women in Tech” workshop on Nov. 13 were females.Follow Huan Xun on Twitter@huanxun_chanGender identity fuels healthcare disparitiesof medical schools that are now adding courses on LGBTQ health and some of them have that as a requirement for graduation,” Wallner said. “But it takes a long time to realize that change in the workforce.” Santa Clara County announced in March that it will be opening up its first transgender health clinic inside the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center located in downtown San Jose. The clinic is expected to open this fall with no set date as of yet as the county is still hiring and training people to work at the facility, San Jose Inside reported.The facility is a step forward for the city of San Jose who Fernando said still has a lot of room for opportunity to increase accessibility for transgender folk.“I have to go as far as San Francisco to get my blood work done, to see my doctor for anything that’s wrong with me in terms of gender health,” Fernando said. Fernando has dedicated herself to being a resource for the transgender community to reach out to when they want to share their stories and get more people to become stronger allies to the transgender and nonbinary communities.“Any trans person’s first form of activism is just living and being out there and being public,” Fernando said.

Despite what society considers feminine or masculine, these artists – past and present – have had an androgynous approach to how they express themselves. Though this is not a new movement, it is imperative to take a moment to celebrate artists who have not let gender roles defy them.Prince was a creative individual who expressed himself through his iconic wardrobe. From his signature purple hue to his dazzling suits and makeup, Prince was not confined to particular gender norms – he looked to strut and style in the way he pleased. He redefined gender norms by unapologetically blurring the lines and encouraged others to authentically be themselves. “I’m not a woman, I am not a man. I am something that you’ll never understand” Prince sings in his 1984 hit “I Would Die 4 U.”PrinceSPOTLIGHTHarry StylesSince 2014, there has been a creative self-awareness shift with Harry Styles. He has ventured in the fashion world with his bell bottom silk suits and experimenting with soft hues and womenswear. Styles has always been known to wear his heart on his sleeve, even when he was in the boy band One Direction. His solo career has been based on being vulnerable and kind. The artist’s merchandise has the phrase “Treat People with Kindness” printed on them. In a recent phone interview with Timothy Chatelet for ID Magazine, Styles said, “I think there’s so much masculinity in being vulnerable and allowing yourself to be feminine. Growing up you don’t even know what those things mean. You have this idea of what being masculine is and as you grow up, you become more comfortable with who you are.” David BowieDavid Bowie was a musical legend who expressed himself through his alter egos such as Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane. His alter egos held an androgynous creative space as encouragement for others to find confidence in themselves. He introduced glam to rock with his flamboyant outfits in a time that conservatives governed society. He wore jumpsuits, catsuits, silk scarves and womenswear, and was also known for his theatrical costumes and use of makeup. In an interview with Vogue, Gucci designer Frida Giannini has said, “Bowie’s shameless androgyny helped women express their masculine strength without losing their feminine glamour and sensuality.” He also gave men an example of how to incorporate feminine glamour elements without losing masculinity aspects of themselves.PHOTOS COURTESY OF WIKIMEDIA COMMONS AND MELODY DEL RIO | SPARTAN DAILYBY MELODY DEL RIO,  STAFF WRITERMale musicians blur the linesARTS & ENTERTAINMENTsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 20186Follow Myla on Twitter@mylalabine25By Myla La BineSTAFF WRITERDisney princesses have been serving as role models for little girls since the early 20th century when “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” was released in 1937.Since then, the standard for Disney princesses has evolved. Each princess has become more independent than the last and demonstrated notable leadership skills. Th ough Moana is not on the offi  cial Disney princess list, she is the most recent “princess” featured in a Disney fi lm and arguably one of the most self-suffi  cient.A comparison of the first Disney prin-cess and the latest one reveals how Dis-ney has disregarded gender roles, stereo-types and society’s overall expectations of women throughout time.Snow White is the perfect example of a female character who adheres to all of these ideals.At the beginning of the fi lm, she sings “I’m Wishing,” a song about wanting to fi nd her one true love. Snow White wishes for a prince to sweep her off  her feet and take her away from her evil stepmother.When she ends up in the seven dwarves’ cottage later on, she immediately takes it upon herself to tidy up their home. She sees it as her duty to do so because she is a woman. She acts as a mother or wife to the seven dwarves and stays home while they work.Snow White doesn’t appear to be inde-pendent or ingenuitive for this reason. Th e only skills she possesses are baking, cook-ing and cleaning. She also cluelessly lets a stranger into the dwarves’ cottage and unknowingly accepts a poisonous apple from that individual.Th e prince ends up waking Snow White with “true love’s kiss” and they ride off into the sunset together.This is obviously an example of the “prince saves a damsel in distress” trope that is used way too often.Given the release date of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,” her characteri-zation is not surprising for that time.“Growing up and watching Snow White being taken care of by seven men gave me the impression that women were dam-sels in distress that needed to be saved by her Prince Charming,” psychology junior Elizabeth Craig said.“I never thought much of it to be honest, I just thought that was how things were.”Craig said she felt empowered the fi rst time she watched “Mulan” because of the character saving her country on her own. Princesses like Mulan, have cer-tainly paved the way for more modern princesses like Moana.Moana is the complete opposite of Snow White and takes initiative early on in her fi lm.Moana sets sail to fi nd Maui on her own in order to restore the heart of Te Fiti and save her island. She doesn’t think twice about doing so and ends up fi nding him. However, Maui needs to find his stolen magical fishhook to help Moana.While one could argue Maui is more powerful than Moana because he is a demigod, it is actually Moana who comes up with a plan to distract Tamatoa so Maui can retrieve his fi shhook.Her wit and determination are what saves them from Tamatoa. Moana, not Maui, also ends up saving Te Fiti aft er he runs away because his fi shhook gets partially destroyed by the evil Te Ka.She is an exceptional leader who never gives up, even if she is close to failure.“Independent princesses like Moana show me that we as women are capable of our own destinies and deciding what we like and don’t like,” child and adolescent devel-opment senior Chloe Orton Cartnal said. Moana’s gender isn’t seen as a weakness whatsoever and her family allows her to become chief without any objections.Unlike Snow White, none of the songs Moana sings are about wanting to find a prince.“How Far I’ll Go” is about Moana’s pride for her family, island and herself. She doesn’t need or want anything dif-ferent than what she already has in her life.Public health junior Halina Ho loves the character for that reason. “I am defi nitely more moved by Moana because she sets herself to become a savior for her island. And she bravely does so,” Ho said. “Although many other princesses such as Mulan and Anna save their families, I think the best part is that there isn’t an expected ro-mantic partner involved in ‘Moana,’” she said.It’s interesting how dissimilar two fe-male characters written in the 20th and 21st century are and how they measure up in terms of gender roles and expectations.Th ough one is technically not better than the other, it is clear that Moana is a much more modern illustration of women and Snow White is incredibly outdated.A look at the gender stereotypes presented in Moana and Snow White, the fi rst and latest Disney princessesvs. PHOTOS COURTESY OF FLICKR (MELISSA HILLIER) AND WIKIPEDIAMusical promotes individual freedomBy Paul Hang STAFF WRITERPerformers sing and act in “Gender Bender,” with some characters swapping their gender roles.PAUL HANG | SPARTAN DAILY“Gender Bender” was performed on Nov. 9 at the Music Concert Hall.PAUL HANG | SPARTAN DAILYSan Jose State Universi-ty professor in the depart-ment of voice and director Sandra Bengochea found inspiration in “Broadway Backwards,” a gender-re-versed musical that tells the stories of LGBT people, for the play “Gender Bender.” Similarly, “Gender Bender” had its actors and actresses play reversed genders. Th e play was developed in the beginning of the semes-ter and was performed on Nov. 9 at the Music Concert Hall. Auditions were held fi rst, and Bengochea would need to fi nd the right per-formers for the right roles.Bengochea wanted peo-ple to be themselves and not feel pressured to follow specifi c gender norms.“Just getting everybody on equal ground and just as blurred as possible. Every-one has something import-ant to do,” Bengochea said.Some male performers wore high heels and short shorts while some female performers were dressed as men by wearing suits and ties.All nine songs that were performed had their sepa-rate stories that were acted and sung by various per-formers. Around 80 people attended the show.Th e musical was fi lled with energy and humor. Performers sang and acted with emotions and the hu-mor came from some of the songs and choreography.Th e fi rst song, Gioachi-no Rossini’s “Come un’ape nei’ giorni d’ Aprile” trans-lated as “Like a bee in the days of April,” had the crowd laughing with joy when Don Ramiro also known as “Th e Prince,” played by Don Nguy-en, made his appearance.The clothes he wore were very funky from the fur-collared jacket to metallic futuristic pants. It got funnier when Don Magnifico, played by Jesse Guzman, a stepfather who wanted The Prince to marry either one of his two daughters ends up lay-ing on the Prince’s lap beg-ging him to do so.However, Th e Prince re-fused Don Magnifi co’s off er and ended up fi nding his true love who happened to be disguised as his valet.Th e humor continued to showcase in the fourth song which was Lucy Simon’s “Pretty Young Men.”Th e song illustrates three friends who go to a strip club and become fascinated by the male strippers they encounter. Th eir acting skills and enthusiastic sing-ing made it entertaining for the audience to watch.Not every song was fi lled with humor, however, the sixth song seemed to be more emotive and darker. William Finn’s “Th e I love you Song” is about a girl named Olive, played by Jasmine Reyes, who is iso-lated from her parents as she competes in the spelling bee.Olive’s mother was also played by a male perform-er in this piece. Her moth-er was played by Dario Johnson to stay true to “Gender Bender’s” theme.In this piece, Oliva was singing about her rocky relationship with her par-ents as they don’t get along with one other. Olivia lived with her abusive father and it aff ected her to need love from her mother.Music education fresh-man Brian You discovered the event through some of the members in choir. He decided to come to the show out of interest and to sup-port his classmates.“Gender Bender” was You’s fi rst opera show, and said he enjoyed it.  “It’s great to see many of these singing actors perform in gender reversals,” You said. “I think the men did great playing the female role and some of the actresses did great with the male.”Music education se-nior AJ Rodriguez, who was also one of the per-formers, found the show to help him market him-self and be able to use his major as a career.“It means more than just getting on stage and having a good time, it’s ex-perience,” Rodriguez said.Rodriguez showed content feelings toward the swapped gender role of the show.“I’m so happy that we decided to do this because it makes people think of traditional musical theater,” Rodriguez said. “We don’t have to be gender neutral.”Follow Paul on Twitter@iTz_BisyMonsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 2018OPINION 7asking at the end of the interview. Th e way I see it, adding pronouns to regular conversation seems a bit much. If I get your preferred pronouns wrong, I’m all for being corrected right away so I can fi x that mistake. However, in cases such as the group discussion I described, it seemed redundant to list our pronouns when the pronouns we listed in my group all matched up with our physical appearances. I have no issue with listing pronouns at the end of an email. However, asking me to state that I abide by he, his, him pronouns when it’s evident that I indeed identify as male to me seems like a waste of time. I’m confi dent and comfortable enough in my own skin that if someone assumes my gender without malicious intent I won’t hold any resentment toward that person the same way I hope they wouldn’t hate me if I assumed they answered to ‘his, hers or theirs.’Parents shouldn’t purchase toys based on genderEXECUTIVE EDITORJACKIE CONTRERASMANAGING EDITORBEN STEIN EXECUTIVE PRODUCERMARCI SUELAPRODUCTION EDITORELISE NICOLAS NEWS EDITORMELISA YURIARA&E EDITORWILLIAM DELA CRUZ OPINION EDITORJASMINE STRACHANSPORTS EDITORGABRIEL MUNGARAYPHOTO EDITORNICHOLAS ZAMORAMULTIMEDIA EDITORMAX RUAN MULTIMEDIA REPORTERNICHOLAS GIRARD ONLINE EDITORSARAH KLIEVES COPY EDITORSDOMINOE IBARRAJANA KADAH AMANDA WHITAKERSTAFF WRITERSHUAN XUN CHAN PAUL HANGCLAIRE HULTINMYLA LA BINEWINONA RAJAMOHANNORA RAMIREZMELODY DEL RIO VICENTE VERA HUGO VERA PRODUCTION CHIEFMIKE CORPOSNEWS ADVISERSNISHA GARUD PATKARSCOTT FOSDICKADVERTISING ADVISERTIM HENDRICKADVERTISING DIRECTORJESSICA EWINGCREATIVE DIRECTORKIMO PAMINTUANADVERTISING STAFFALAN CHOIKRYSTAL DANGSOMER  ELLISRICKY LAMCHRISTOPHER LAPENAPAWAN NARAYANLEANN MAE RACOMAJENNIE SINICOLAS SISTOKIANA UNTALANCONTACT USEDITORIALPHONE: (408) 924-5577EMAIL:SPARTANDAILY@GMAIL.COMADVERTISINGPHONE:(408) 924-3270EMAIL:SPARTANDAILYADVERTISING@GMAIL.COMMyla La BineSTAFF WRITERPHOTOS BY MYLA LA BINE, INFOGRAPHIC BY JASMINE STRACHAN AND MARCI SUELA | SPARTAN DAILYHugo VeraSTAFF WRITERFollow Hugo on Twitter@ HugoV_IIFrom the time we’re born, we’re expected to conform to certain gender expectations. Our parents buy us toys based on these ideals: boys tend to play with trucks and action fi gures, while girls primarily enjoy dolls.According to National Geographic, sociologist Elizabeth Sweet discov-ered in her examination of Sears catalogs from the 20th century that “gen-der-based toy ads from the 1920s to the 1950s pushed traditional roles for girls to be the ‘little homemaker’ and boys to be the ‘young man of industry.’ ”While this was an issue then, it still occurs today.Th ese types of toys reinforce dangerous gender stereotypes and make children be-lieve it is necessary to accept them.According to the Mayo Clinic, most children are fi xed on gender stereo-types by age 5 or 6.I think parents are to blame for continuing this trend and it needs to stop. Th ere is a great deal of harm in pushing chil-dren to like specifi c toys.Th e Institution for En-gineering and Technolo-gy stated in a study that science, technology, en-gineering and math toys were three times as likely to be marketed toward boys than girls. Th is is not only un-fair, but also detrimental because it makes little girls think they are not allowed to be interested in these subjects, which is simply not true.Th is implications of that notion are seen in the modern work-place, especially in STEM fi elds. A study done by Statis-ta stated that 26 percent of the total workforce at Microsoft  consists of women and 32 percent of Apple’s total workforce is women.I believe the prima-ry reason as to why this happens is because of they toys parents buy for their children. A perfect example of this is when par-ents take their children to McDonald’s. When purchasing a happy meal, a person is asked by the employee taking their order if it is “for a boy or girl.” A parent would ob-viously answer with the gender of their child; the belief is that a boy wouldn’t want a princess toy, nor would a girl want a monster truck. However, from my ex-perience that is not the case with every child.When I was growing up, I loved playing with baby dolls but also liked Hot Wheels. My parents had no problem with choosing, what many considered to be, a boy toy for me if I wanted it.Associate psychol-ogy professor Lisa Di-nella of Monmouth University, stated to Canadian Broadcast-ing Corporation Ra-dio that toy marketing is eff ective.  “Kids notice the sub-tle cues that are part of the toys that leads them to decide that a toy is a girl toy or a boy toy, and whether it’s for them or not for them. And it ac-tually changes their in-terest in the toy and so that is guiding kids’ play activities,” Dinella stated.However, that should not be the case. Chil-dren should be able to play with whatever they want.Children should not have gender forced on them through toys be-cause it can have an im-pact on them later on in life.Gender doesn’t have a single defi nition. Th ere isn’t anything specifi c that determines whether a child considers them-selves male or female. Regardless of wheth-er a boy wants to play with a tea set or a girl wants to play with a di-nosaur, parents should accept and support their child’s decisions.Follow Myla on Twitter@mylalabine25In today’s world, people have taken their political correctness more seriously than ever, and understandably so. In eff orts to decol-onize and tear apart racist, sexist and back-ward-thinking societal norms, marginalized groups have created and implemented a plethora of new terms that they identify themselves.  Terms such as “Latinx” and “non-binary” have created a better sense of identity to groups such as the Latin and LGBTQ community. However, not every advance to be as politically correct as possible has been well-received by individuals who want simplicity, not complexity. One of the newest trends in the war on ig-norance that has both heterosexual and pan-sexual people confused is the use of gendered pronoun letterheads. It’s typically seen at the end of a letter or e-mail below the author’s name, they list their preferred pronouns. Th ey oft en read “she, her, hers,” “he, him, his,” or “they, them, theirs.At fi rst glance, it’s nothing worth a second look, with all due re-spect. Letterheads are a direct refl ection of their authors and as is the case, people should be free to include whatever they wish in their letterheads. Th is ranges from mil-itary ranks to honorary degrees to one’s profes-sion. My own letterhead states that I am a mem-ber of the Eagle Scouts of America and it lists the three positions I hold on-campus at San Jose State University.Where things get com-plicated however, is when we attempt to integrate pronouns into regular everyday dialogue. At this semester’s discussion forum on the term “Latinx” put on by the Chicanx/Latinx Student Success Center, the audience was asked to introduce themselves by fi rst stating one’s name followed by their pronouns. As I expected, this task was puzzling to many in-cluding myself and was extremely time-consum-ing. As someone who has always been comfortable with their gender and their “own skin,” it nev-er occurred to me that I would need to make my pronouns known.I mistakenly said, “Hugo Vera, he … hers, I mean his … him” before I corrected myself and got it right. Others in attendance of this event also struggled to list their correct pronouns and many questioned if the action was even necessary at all. In fairness to those who like to establish their pronouns when in-troducing themselves, I want to say I understand. As someone described as a “bleeding-heart liberal,” I understand how important polit-ical correctness is to some people. Still, I cannot fully get behind the idea of making people verbally establish their pronouns at the start of every discussion, and again I say this respectfully.Th e trend of ending emails with pronouns was a topic of discussion in an interview I once conducted with Latinx and LGBTQ rights activist and stage actor Dan Guerrero who wrote and directed his own one-man biopic show, “¡Gaytino!” As a gay man who combated racism and homophobia his entire adult life, he shared the sentiment that ending letters with pronouns isn’t always necessary. “Like if they really want to know, can’t they just ask?” was a question we found ourselves both Regardless of whether a boy wants to play with a tea set or a girl wants to play with a dinosaur, parents should accept and support their child’s decisions.Gender pronoun letterheads are not necessaryThis fi gure of Mrs. Potts from Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” is  an example of a motherly character that exudes femininity. This dinosaur encourages fi ghting or action play, which is considered masculine.OPINIONsjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 20188A video at a Chicago Bulls game, a fi refi ght-er hose or spouting out pink water, opening the mouth of an alligator – gender reveal parties have grown into a cultural phenomenon far beyond the use of just a pink or blue balloon.Th e three scenari-os above were some of the gender reveals list-ed by CNN aft er they dominated social me-dia with waves of oohs and aahs. Th ese parties are noth-ing new on the agenda of expecting parents and quite frankly, I have nev-er seen them as a matter subject to public scrutiny up until recently when many of them started to emerge as viral videos on the internet. As our world shift s into deeper understand-ings of diversity in so-cietal climates putting the idea of together-ness to the test, gen-der identity has been a key discussion. Gender is no longer a concept that many com-munities want to confuse with the defi nition of sex, which is the biolog-ical makeup of a human at birth. As people become more aware of the need for elevated protections and rights for those in the LGBTQ communi-ty, the idea of a clearly divided party celebrat-ing an unborn baby as a boy or a girl is be-coming a debacle that many fi nd unsuitable in a world demanding gender equality.Coming across vid-eos of gender reveal parties not only unveil comments of awe mar-veling at the lengths some parents would go, but also comments of pure fury.Th e anger-fi lled ar-guments describe these parties as an act that con-tinues to promote social norms stigmatizing non-binary genders or those who identify as transgen-der, solidifying cultural expectations skewered into being a boy or a girl. A journal on gender studies by Carly Giesel-er, an assistant profes-sor at York University, dives into the notion of gender reveal par-ties being a reiteration of these expectations by making use of society’s increasing need to share their lives to the world through outlets such as social media. According to CNN, retail store Party City launched a gender reveal party line in 2016 because of the explosive popularity of these parties, with nearly one million of its party items being sold each year.In that sense, gender reveal parties are as-sumed to be a tool for the perpetuation of gen-der discrimination while feeding a selfi sh desire to turn everything into a celebration.I have one statement for that – it’s just not that deep. I don’t think that ex-pecting parents should be called selfi sh or ig-norant if they choose to celebrate a revelation about a child who they will soon welcome into the world. I believe that it is a cherishable moment that is worthy to be shared with as many people as they want. I don’t assume that wiping off  the existence of these parties would give rise to a new cultural awakening where every-body who is uncomfort-able with fl uid gender identities would just drop their prejudices. Neither do I assume that parents are more likely to reject their chil-dren making their own independent decisions about their gender be-cause they once threw a gender reveal party all those years ago. If there’s anything that I believe should be changed about gender reveal parties, it would not be the erasing it al-together but rather so smoothing the rough edges of this celebra-tion to paint it in a more inclusive light. Instead of being called a gender reveal par-ty, maybe it should be called a sex reveal party or a reveal party since parents are not celebrat-ing the social construct of gender identifi cation that is not determined by biological sex organs at birth. If these parties pose such a threat because it encourages people to conform to gender-spe-cifi c expectations, then perhaps the problem lies in the widespread generalization of blue for boys and pink for girls that are used in these parties.Th is celebration by itself should not be something to be looked at as the public enemy for progress because it was never brought into existence with any-thing else on the agen-da besides being a mo-ment of celebration for expecting parents.If I was expecting a baby, I would turn ev-erything into a party if I could because my child would mean the world to me.I would want to turn every milestone of my child’s life or my parenthood into a big deal. I understand that transforming a society to fully accept and respect all individuals regardless of their diff erences takes more than just chang-es in government pol-icies but also accounts for changes in day-to-day behavior. Th e rise of gender re-veal parties as a big and bold event for some families has little to do with their desire of raising children follow-ing the stereotypes that come with the color of smoke bursting out of a helium balloon.Th e rise of gender reveal parties has to do with more families willing to put in extra money and eff ort to ca-ter to their excitement of raising a child.

Th roughout the centuries, many Chi-nese families have faced disappointment when they had to welcome a baby girl to the family.I couldn’t imagine that a new life is not wel-comed because of the biological sex, a fact which is uncontrollable and unchangeable.According to medical journal the BMJ, Universi-ty College London global health professor Th érèse Hesketh wrote the histori-cal factor of son preference in China. In an agrarian economy that is based on producing crops and farmland, males are preferred because they are physically more capa-ble of farmworks and be-come the breadwinner of the family. However, society does not leave the ideology of gender preference behind aft er the male majority leaves the farms and work in other industries.In today’s male-domi-nated world, Chinese so-ciety remains patriarchal. Sons are able to continue the family line because they are generally the recipients of inheritance, according to BMJ.Chinese surnames are important identities, as many regard family names as a symbol of their blood relationship.Th ough looking back on its history, the surname identity and solidarity have declined in the past cen-tury. However, the feudal mindset is still deeply-root-ed in some conservative Chinese families.In order to prevent over-population from holding back China’s economic development, the govern-ment implemented the one-child policy in 1979, limiting the majority of families to have only one child. Because of son pref-erence in the society, many women had to abort fe-male infants.Even though I am eth-nically Chinese, because I was not born in China, people around me who favor sons do not abort when they have baby girls. Without the birth restric-tion, they give birth to daughters until they get a son. My elementary school classmate has three young-er sisters because her par-ents really wanted a son. I have another friend who has two younger sisters and fi nally, her younger brother joined the family. Th e son becomes the “prince” of the family and their parents overindulge them.According to the New World Encyclopedia, the decline of Confucianism and the rise of Commu-nism in mainland China undermine the importance Follow Huan Xun on Twitter@Huanxun_chanWinona RajamohanSTAFF WRITERIt’s a novelty: gender reveal parties are funof surnames. Th e infl ux of Western culture and forces of globalization have con-tributed to weakening the Chinese surname identity.Nevertheless, when we take a look at China’s 2010 census result, the statistics show the overall sex ratio at birth with 119 males to 100 females, which is higher than the standard ratio of about 105 males to 100 females, according to Population Reference Bu-reau. Th e result implicates that up to the past decade when one-child policy was enforced, son preference still exists.Th anks to the advance-ment of technology, which allows people to abort the fetus before they are born, the son preference is no longer violating women physically and mental-ly because the baby girls who are not being fa-vored do not even have a chance to brought into to this world.I did not experience the neglection of be-ing a daughter in my nuclear family. My parents raised my younger brother and me fairly and provided us with equal opportunities to learn as we grew. It was diff erent during my grandparents’ gen-eration. Sons had the opportunity to go to school. My grandfather and his younger brother went to elementary school, whereas his younger sis-ters and my grandmother were illiterate. I am lucky to be born in this generation when educational opportuni-ties are fair to both gen-ders. Son preference is no longer violating wom-en’s rights to be educated and putting women in a lower status.Th roughout the years, I believe son preference has declined but still exists in China’s male-dominated society. It remains as the fami-lies who still favor sons can make a choice before the baby is born or give birth until they have a son. The rise of gender reveal parties has to do with more families being willing to put in extra money and effort to cater to their excitement of raising a child. I am lucky to be born in this generation when educational opportunities are fair to both genders.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 2018OPINION 9Th ough it takes both a sperm and an egg to create a child, there is an unfair truth that the bur-den of contraception and pregnancy falls primarily on women.Women are expected to take all types of birth control, as well as car-ry and birth the child if they become pregnant. Why don’t men carry any responsibility?Women have the pain of having a menstrual cy-cle, carrying a child and all the side eff ects that come with both. Men hardly take part in the birthing process or endure the pain that women feel. In a survey done by the Kaiser Family Foun-dation called “Men’s Role In Preventing Pregnan-cy,” the results displayed that more than half of the men involved in the study did not know a lot about contraceptive options. One in fi ve of those men claimed to know little to nothing about the subject at all.Th is is a big issue and contributes heavily to the pressing stress that women face. According to Planned Parenthood’s website, there are fi ve options for male birth control. Th ese are condoms, abstinence, vasectomies, withdrawal and outercourse. Abstinence and outer-course involve not having intercourse, withdrawal has low rates of eff ective-ness, and a vasectomy is a medical sterilization procedure that is perma-nent. None of these are great options for men and women.On the other hand, women have 14 diff erent types of birth control. Th ese are female con-doms, tubal ligation, IUDs, the birth control, the NuvaRing, the Patch, dia-phragm, cervical cap, Plan B, spermicidal jellies and foams, the sponge, a small piece of white plastic foam that is inserted in the vagi-na, Depo-Provera, outer-course and abstinence. Female birth control is expensive. Th e pill costs anywhere from $15 to $50 a month. Th is is an expense that men will never have to encounter.It enrages me how much more women have to deal with, the expens-es and how mentally and physically tolling it is to be a woman.I do not think that it is a bad thing to have so many options for birth control, as each woman responds diff erently to each type. However, zoning in on how women can prevent pregnancy from occur-ring lessens the spotlight of the responsibility men should have.I also believe that men should be encouraged to take some type of contra-ceptive whether that is a pill, shot or a patch. Men should be able to truly understand how much work it can take to control and eff ectively manage your fertility.In a study done by the University of Washington, researchers came up with a pill for men to use as a contraceptive. Th e pill is called dimethandrolone undecanoate and it works to reduce the levels of hor-mones to amounts that are low enough to suppress sperm production.Since the researchers an-nounced the pill earlier in 2018, the majority of men who participated in a poll on the website Healthline said that they would not use the pill. Th e root of this problem is the reality that men do not want the responsibility on their hands and are un-willing to take something to prevent pregnancy, even though women have to and do so every day.Maybe things will change in the future, but it is doubtful. Seeing as women are still the only gender to be able to pro-duce a child, the respon-sibility may weigh on them forever.Bedridden and recov-ering from the fl u, I once saw the 2014 fi lm “Draft  Day.” Aside from the fact that it’s objectively one of the worst movies ever made, one of the many issues that stuck out to me is how the fi lm tries to downplay a clear elephant in the room. In the fi lm, Kevin Costner’s character is expecting a child with a female lead played by Jen-nifer Garner. Costner was 59 years old at the time. Garner was 42 years old. Watching the fi lm also reminded me of several other notable age gaps that are oft en presented in fi lm and television. In the Th or fi lms, Sir An-thony Hopkins, who is 80 years old, is married to Rene Russo who is 64 years old. In the hit-sitcom “Mod-ern Family,” Ed O’Neill’s 72-year-old character is married to Sofi a Vergara’s character who is 46 years old. Th e trend of older male leads being paired with signifi cantly young-er female partners in television and cinema is nothing new, but is surely something that needs to be addressed. In his compelling ar-ticle, “Leading Men Age, But Th eir Love Interests Don’t,” Vulture columnist Kyle Buchanan pinpoint-ed some of the most un-settling age-gaps present-ed in the media. One of the most startling was the 2013 fi lm “Th e Th ird Person” in which a then 61-year-old Liam Neeson sleeps with 29-year-old Olivia Wilde.Washington Post col-umnist Jeff  Guo’s article, “Why the age of 40 is so important in Holly-wood,” Guo examines the clearly-sexist trend in which female actors such as Meryl Streep and Sally Field were off ered signifi -cantly less roles aft er they each turned 40 whereas actors such as Neeson and Kurt Russell continue to be off ered roles well into their 60s. “I remember as I was hovering around 40, I thought each movie would be my last, real-ly,” Streep said during a 2016 interview with Th e Wall Street Journal. “Th e roles they write for women my age … usually they are sort of gorgons or dragons or in some way grotesque.”While older male ac-tors have a good chance of being paired with a much younger woman, female characters are al-most never paired with someone younger. In the biopic “Th e Iron Lady,” Streep’s on-screen husband Jim Broadbent is the exact same age as her. “It makes sense that this ideology is being translated on screen be-cause one of the main ways our society puts val-ue on women is through physical appearance and attractiveness,” psychol-ogy junior Jessie Tashi-nari said. “It comes to no surprise that women are objectifi ed and one way this plays out is by being arm candy, in a sense, for these much older men on screen.” Another issue with the age gap in media is that in the rare cases when older women are paired with younger men, it is usually meant to play on the “cougar” mental-ity that oversexualizes older women. In fi lms such as “Th e Graduate” and “Th e Door in the Floor,” young-er male leads Dustin Hoff man and Jon Fos-ter engage in lust-driven relationships with sig-nifi cantly older actresses Anne Bancroft  and Kim Basinger, respectively. Films such as these suggest that sex with older women is a kind of taboo, guilty pleasure which objectifi es older women dating young-er men rather than to portray them as sentient beings who just hap-pen to prefer a younger male partner. In short, gender-based age gaps in the media set a toxic example. Th ey reinforce “sugar dad-dy” and “MILF” tropes that have since evolved into sexist and danger-ous mindsets. Perhaps one day we’ll fi nally see a healthy on-screen re-lationship between say a 73-year-old Helen Mir-ren and 51-year-old Vin Diesel. Until then, it’s time to do away with projects in which the leading man is old enough to be his fe-male partner’s father.

Not only are women divided by the sport, but they are also divided by name.Women athletes are re-ferred to as ‘females’ or ‘ladies,’ only marginaliz-ing them from the rest of the world. According to the magazine Th e Week, traditionalist words are used to refer to women in sports. “Women are twice as likely to be referred to as ‘ladies,’ compared to ‘gentlemen,’ who are frequently referred to by the neutral term ‘men’ to make females stand out from their counterparts,” Th e Week explained.Growing up, I felt a bit marginalized by the use of the prefi x ‘lady.’ My mas-cot in middle school was a Bulldog. I was a Bulldog in and out of school, always proud to represent my school, however, the name “Lady Bulldog” was chosen for the girls.It angered me and I didn’t understand why only boys deserved to be called Bull-dogs, why not “Gentlemen Bulldogs” like the girls. Th is made me question my place in school, who was I? Did I have the same power as my male counterparts?Th is issue continued during high school where women were referred to as “Lady Bears” never as Bears. Th is disempowered me, it made me feel sup-pressed, held back from the world and from taking action. Sexism is a fact in school sports.During sporting events, all women sports teams were “ladies” a term that directly denied them from being ferocious and aggres-sive. I thought women can be fi erce in the game, how-ever, the schools disagreed.According to the Ten-nessean newspaper, using labels like “Lady” can be harmful to female athletes because it makes them feel as if their “physical appear-ance has to be in tune with the standards of what we call hegemonic femininity.” Distinguishing between male and female athletes can cause women to have to “worry about their at-tractiveness as well as their athleticism,” the Tennesse-an newspaper explained.According to Th e Week, the magazine showed that Linguists at Cambridge University Press analyzed the word and found that there are “higher levels of infantilizing or traditional-ist language for women in sports, who are more like-ly to be referred to as ‘girls’ than men are called ‘boys.’” In an article Th e New Republic magazine pub-lished, feminist linguist Robin Lakoff  said in a 1973 academic paper, “cleaning lady is at least as common as cleaning woman, salesla-dy as saleswoman. But no one says, normally, woman doctor. To say lady doctor is to be condescending.” Lakoff  notes that there are no prefi xes used to refer to women in higher pro-fessions rather a division between men and women is made to “distinguish” their abilities. Th e Univer-sity of Southern California refers to their male stu-dents as Trojans while they refer to female students as Women of Troy for its women’s teams.Fortunately, San Jose State University does not include any prefi xes for any of its female sports teams.“Female athlete” is as de-meaning as “Lady Bears” or “Lady Bulldogs.” All terms point women out giving them a certain distinction. We have to get away from the labels and stop margin-alizing women due to their sexuality or gender.It’s sickening to see a division between genders to distinguish what’s good from what’s not as good.

Women have been stigmatized with domes-tic behaviors. When they stand on the field or court, the athletes’ hard work and performances seem to be disvalued, partic-ularly by the mainstream sports media. Sports media helps pro-pel this stereotype in its unequal coverage of male and female athletes. According to the docu-mentary “Media Coverage and Female Athletes,” 40 percent of all sports participants are women. However, women’s sports receive only about 4 percent of all sports media coverage.San Jose State University women’s basketball junior guard Fa-Ko-Fieme’a Hafoka said, “Let’s just talk about ESPN or SportsCenter. The way that they talk about the WNBA compared to the NBA is not the same.” She said the highlights, the amount of time allo-cated and the accessibility for the NBA and WNBA is different.“I think it’s not fair. Many women’s sports should be equal as we’re doing the same thing, we’re compet-ing at the same level, we’re out here doing what they do. There should be no dif-ference,” Hafoka said.In sports publica-tions such as ESPN, the articles and the time devoted to cover women’s sports on the network are cynically low.The article “The Inequality of Sport: Women < Men” shows a five-year study on the ESPN show SportsCenter. Statistics showed that SportsCenter devoted only 2 percent of its airtime to women’s sports. The research in 2002 found the gender ratio of stories ran on ESPN was more than 48 to one, strongly favoring men.A group of SJSU kinesiol-ogy students did a research on “Gender Bias in ESPN vs. espnW Content.” The research group investigat-ed the articles about female and male sports posted on espnW and ESPN websites by analyzing the top stories in the home page of each site and “the buzz” located underneath the top stories section of espnW.Kinesiology senior Joanna Peet shared their findings during the student research fair. “On the espnW site, there is 25 percent of male articles but there is only 17 per-cent of female articles, on a website that is supposed to be a platform for women,” Peet said. Women’s basketball head coach Jamie Craighead said it is hard to judge whether there is a bias because bas-ketball seasons for men and women are different. However, she said, “When it’s NBA season, you can see highlights from all the games and all the scores. I don’t know that I will see that when it comes to WNBA.”Craighead said the rea-son for less coverage on women’s sports is partly because of the generally low interest.“Media is driven by what consumers want, so I think it would be nice if more females empowered other females. If there are women who are interested in sports, or even if they are not, they are just support-ing women, maybe then we would get more coverage,” she said.According to The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the imbal-ance in the quality and quantity of sports coverage between women and men still continues. “Two weeks of Olympic coverage are a rare time when sustained coverage of women sports stars hits the headlines,” stated in the organization’s website.In the “Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media” pub-lished by the organization, it provided several sugges-tions for media to decrease the gap between women’s and men’s sports. The suggestions include host-ing special “gender and sports” program, handing the mic to women and most importantly, bring-ing women’s sports to the forefront.Whether the media should give more expo-sure to women’s sports or sports fans should pay more attention to female sports, we may never know which needs to happen first. While the imbal-ance gap has improved throughout the years, there is still a distance to reach equality.Follow Huan Xun on Twitter@Huanxun_chanLet’s just talk about ESPN or SportsCenter.

I’m old,” Tobin said.D e s p i t e T o b i n ’ s uncertainty from the a t h l e t i c s perspective, Tobin noted the student’s m a t u r i t y t o w a r dgender.“The one beautiful thing that I’ve seen in col-lege athletics is students know so much and are more mature about differ-ent people and their sexual preferences,” Tobin said.Women’s volleyball senior outside hitter Giulia Gavio said she is open to coed sports like Khorami.“I think it’ll be interest-ing. Something that has never happened before, so it’s something new that we can look forward,” Gavio said.sjsunews.com/spartan_daily TUESDAY, NOV. 20, 2018SPORTS 11By Hugo VeraSTAFF WRITERINFOGRAPHIC BY HUGO VERA | SPARTAN DAILYOn a busy Sunday morning, I entered the last 90 minutes of my shift at a Starbucks in south Fremont. I thought to myself, “The good news is that I’ll be out of here in the time it takes to play a soccer game.”Strangely enough, that would not be my only reminder of the sport I so passionately love. In walked two-time FIFA Women’s World Cup champion and Olympic gold-medalist midfield-er Brandi Chastain. I almost could not believe it and I would not believe it until I rang her up in which I confirmed that her name was indeed “Brandi” spelled with an “i.” In addition to being bla-tantly starstruck, I aban-doned my post at the reg-ister to take a picture with Chastain before she left but the part that ultimate-ly surprised me was that no one else did the same. With the exception of one other coworker who knew who Chastain was, no one else at that packed cafe seemed to even notice the female global sports icon in the room that day.While not being able to recognize someone like Chastain is in no way a sexist act in itself, the situ-ation with Chastain at my Starbucks sheds a light on just how underappreciat-ed and plainly “unseen” women are in the sport of soccer.Chastain won two of the three FIFA Women’s World Cup titles secured by the United States Women’s National Soccer Team and yet the athletes on this three-time champion team aren’t treated nearly as well as the American men’s team.The U.S. Men’s National Soccer Team has never won World Cups and the team became a source for global ridicule when it failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia this past summer. Despite the men’s shortcomings, the American women’s team is still paid about four times less than its male counterparts, according to Sports Illustrated.Despite generating more than $20 million in tick-et and merchandise sales following their 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup championship, American women players still receive less money than the men by a margin of up to $15,000 when it comes to appear-ance fees and playing in friendlies. Sports Illustrated and ESPN report that for each friendly win, the United States Men’s National Team players are paid $17,625 whereas the wom-en’s players are only paid $1,350. In addition, a friendly loss still results in $5,000 in revenue for the men’s team. This means that the men make more money after a loss than the women do with a win. This is nothing short of a national disgrace. The sexism doesn’t just stop in the United States. Before stepping down in 2015 amid money laun-dering and extortion allegations, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter proposed to promote women’s soccer by over-sexualizing its players. In 2011, Blatter suggested that the women play in more “feminine” uniforms that included “tighter and shorter shorts.” While such plans for a uniform change never came to fruition, FIFA took money-saving liber-ties with the 2015 Women’s World Cup in Canada that they did not take in the 2014 FIFA Men’s World Cup in Brazil. In Brazil, the men played on real turf where-as every pitch during the Canadian tournament contained artificial turf which costs half as much as real grass according to Forbes. While play-ing on the artificial turf, female players report-ed sustaining skin burns and additional damage to their skin.“It is a gender equality issue. No chance would the men ever play a World Cup on fake turf,” U.S. Women’s National Team forward Sydney Leroux said in an interview with CBS News. Leroux posted pictures of her shins on social media which showed her legs swollen and red after sliding on the polyurethane turf.Despite the blatant dou-ble standard, women in soccer continue to make progress toward equal-ity. In 2016, prominent members of the Women’s National Team including forward Abby Wambach and midfielder Carli Lloyd filed a class-action lawsuit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against U.S. Soccer in response to the obvious wage gap. In June, women in Iran were allowed to watch the 2018 FIFA World Cup during a watch party held at Azadi Stadium in Tehran. It was the first time in the nation’s his-tory that women were not legally barred from attending a sporting event of any kind. Despite the progress made, there’s still far more to go on and off the pitch. “Those things take time. You don’t turn those things around overnight but I feel we’re clos-er than we’ve ever been and I feel in my lifetime, pretty soon, that will happen,” Chastain said in a 2017 interview with Larry King.Follow Hugo on Twitter@HugoV_IIAthletes are open to coed sports in NCAAMELODY DEL RIO | SPARTAN DAILYThe Nat ional Collegiate Athletic A s s o c i a t i o n (NCAA) cur-rently has gender-seg-r e g a t e d sports divi-sions. The NCAA has been a non-profit sports organization for male athletes since 1910.The NCAA did not support women’s ath-letics until 1980 when the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women governed it to existence in the United States.Fitness  website Livestrong states that at a young age female ath-letes can compete against male athletes.“Some girls devel-op faster than boys and may be able to compete with boys their age well into puberty.”Livestrong also men-tioned a 12-year-old girl Makhaela Jenkins who fought for her right to play on a boys-on-ly football team in court and won.Cerritos College news-paper publication Talon Marks ran an opinion piece on how co-ed sports shouldn’t be considered in colleges.“Men and women have different physical capabilities and it is a fact that the vast majority of men are stronger than women,” Marks said.Sports Illustrated’s “Can Female Athletes Win with a Coed Team?” supported the idea of having female athletes playing with male athletes.“It’s hard for a 140-pound girl to contend with a 240-pound guy on the football field just in sheer mass, but that doesn’t mean a 140-pound girl couldn’t compete on a baseball field where size is less of a determining factor for success.”Anya Alvarez from The Guardian mention in her article, “Men are stronger than women. But that doesn’t make them better athletes.”Alvarez quotes former US Open Champion Geoff Ogilvy’s thoughts on Lydia Ko as a professional female golfer to back up her statement:“I especially like to see [women] hit shots with hybrids. It’s a joke how talented they are with those clubs. I’m actually prepared to believe that Lydia Ko is better than the vast majority of male pros from, say, 200 yards out. She is ridiculously good. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that the top women players consistently hit closer to where they are aiming than do the top guys.”San Jose State University currently supports eight different sports for men while the women have 12 sports they can play at SJSU. The six exclusive women sports include gymnastics, soft-ball, swimming & diving, volleyball, beach volley-ball and tennis.Men’s soccer junior for-ward Suliman Khorami is open to the idea of colleges including coed teams. “It’ll be different. It’ll be just a new thing overall,” Khorami said.Follow Paul on Twitter@iTz_BisyMonBy Paul Hang STAFF WRITERLooking at the unlevel playing fi eldIt is a gender equality issue.
