Our analysis identifies a substantial group of gay men without parenting desires and intentions comparedto heterosexuals and bisexuals, and the lack of legal recognition of same‐sex families as a crucial barrier to gay parenthood.The qualitative enquiry, based on semi‐structured interviews with 23 self‐identified gay men aged 25 to 47 years, exploreshow they reflect on (not) becoming parents and contextualises those reflections. The deployed concept of “parental con‐sciousness” captures the variety of considered pathways to gay parenthood and proves itself useful in understanding thelow parenting desires and a generational shift among Czech gay men. We argue that men able to come out in their earlyadulthood in the post‐socialist context tend to have more diversified perspectives on possible pathways to parenthood.Among gaymenwithout children,we identified three distinct perceptions of the state: given childlessness, chosen childfreelife, and a life stage/indecision. The informants pursuing parenthood have seen identity‐specific barriers to parenthood ascrucial, which is discussed in the context of state selective regulations of the relational lives of persons with non‐normativeidentities. Although Czech gay men’s parental consciousness has increased, legal conditions remain crucial for increasingtheir real‐life options.Keywordsbarriers to gay parenthood; childlessness; Czechia; gay men; parenting desires and intentionsIssueThis article is part of the issue “Fragile Pronatalism?

IntroductionIn so‐called Western societies, the LGBTQ+ movementplayed an essential role in legitimising intimate rela‐tions and parenting constellations other than those prac‐tised by heterosexual individuals (Roseneil et al., 2013).Research carried out mainly in the Anglo‐American con‐text documented how lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB)parenting aspirations are shaped by the sociocultural,legislative, and institutional conditions (e.g., Baiocco &Laghi, 2013; Gato et al., 2017; Lasio et al., 2020; Lealet al., 2019; Riskind & Patterson, 2010; Shenkman et al.,2021). In some countries, the growing number of same‐sex families has been referred to as a “gay baby‐boom”(Johnson & O’Connor, 2002). However, other countries,including Czechia, show resistance to adopting legisla‐tion to support LGBTQ+ parenting rights (e.g., Guasti& Bustikova, 2020; ILGA‐Europe, 2021), and the parent‐hood of non‐heterosexual persons lacks recognition inthese countries (e.g., Mizielińska et al., 2015; Takács &Social Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 124Szalma, 2020). Thus, it is important to investigate howLGB parenting aspirations are shaped by conditions in dif‐ferent contexts.In this article, we focus on childlessness, parent‐ing desires, intentions, and the barriers to parenthoodamong non‐straight men in Czechia. Considering thetopic of LGBTQ+ parenthood is underresearched inpost‐socialist countries, and that there is a research gapin understanding gaymen’s parenting desires, intentions,and experiences of childlessness/pathways to parent‐hood, particularly in this region, we undertook an explo‐rative mixed‐methods study with a main focus on quali‐tative enquiry to obtain a comprehensive knowledge ofthe topic.While most research on LGB parenting desires andintentions is based on convenience sample surveys, ourresearch also demonstrates the advantage of combin‐ing qualitative data with a quantitative sample derivedfrom a country‐representative online panel. The quanti‐tative enquiry maps men’s parenting desires and inten‐tions by their sexual identities and perceived barriers togay parenthood, while the qualitative enquiry exploresgay men’s experiences and meanings of (not) becomingparents and contextualises them—resorting to the con‐cepts of “parental consciousness” and “heteronormativ‐ity.” The contribution our study tries to make is twofold:First, we endeavour to fill the knowledge gap on par‐enting desires, intentions, and the barriers to parent‐hood among gaymen in Czechia; second, wewant to vali‐date a research approach that allows the use of in‐depthknowledge of gaymen’s experiences of childlessness andbarriers to parenthood to better understand some ofthe differences in men’s parenting desires and inten‐tions according to their sexual identity. Finally, we dis‐cuss our findings with previous studies on LGBTQ+ par‐enting desires, intentions, and barriers to parenthood inneighbouring post‐socialist countries to indicate a possi‐ble avenue for future research.2. Theoretical BackgroundLate‐modern societies provide individuals with morefreedom for shaping their biographies. Widespread birthcontrol and assisted reproductive technologies havehelped decouple sexuality from reproduction and freereproduction from heterosexual intercourse. This hascontributed to an increasing acceptance of childlessnessas a deliberately adopted way of life—coined “child‐free” (Lunneborg, 1999)—and the simultaneous spreadof same‐sex families (Roseneil et al., 2013).Although becoming a parent is increasingly seen asnon‐mandatory, it remains an expected life transitionthat tends to be associated with heterosexuality as itsprivilege. There remains a tendency to stigmatise fami‐lies that deviate from the norm of heterosexuality (Lasioet al., 2020). Here, researcherswrite about heteronorma‐tively prescribed childlessness (Takács, 2018) and strate‐gic denial of and compensation for parenting desiresamong gay men and lesbians (Kuhar & Takács, 2007;Mizielińska & Kulpa, 2011).It does not mean that LGBTQ+ people do not expresspositive parenting desires and intentions (i.e., wishesand plans to become a parent). Besides various sociode‐mographic, personal, relational, ideational, structural,and cultural factors that influence parenting desires,intentions, and transitions to parenthood in general,studies have identified factors affecting non‐straightmen’s parenting desires and intentions in particular.They include heteronormativity in social institutions andinteractions (Mizielińska & Stasińska, 2018), internalisedheteronormativity (Pacilli et al., 2011), the legal condi‐tions of becoming a parent and the parenting rights ofnon‐straight persons (Takács, 2018), experiences of stig‐matisation (Baiocco & Laghi, 2013; Jeffries et al., 2020;Leal et al., 2019), minority stress‐related avoidance ofintimacy and interdependence (Shenkman et al., 2019),and the financial, time, and other costs of non‐straightmen’s pathways to parenthood by means of surro‐gacy, adoption, multiparenting (e.g., with a lesbian cou‐ple), and foster care (Golombok, 2015; Murphy, 2013).Country differences in parenting aspirations of LGB peo‐ple were also explained by individualistic or familis‐tic value orientations, pronatalism, and economic con‐straints at the societal level (Shenkman et al., 2021).Quantitative studies done mainly in so‐calledWestern countries demonstrate weaker parentingdesires and intentions among non‐straight persons anda greater desire‐intention gap among gaymen comparedto their straight and bisexual peers (e.g., Baiocco & Laghi,2013; Riskind & Patterson, 2010). Gay men thus con‐vert their desire into an intention to have a child lessoften than non‐gay men and are more likely to remainchildless (Gato et al., 2017). Furthermore, Riskind andTornello (2017) indicate more similarities between bisex‐ual and straight men than gay men because bisexualpersons are more likely to have children in different‐sexcouples. We were inspired by such studies and expectedto observe similar trends in our first quantitative map‐ping in Czechia. We anticipated low parenting desiresand intentions among gay men due to homophobia anda long history of selective pronatalism in Czechia thatexcludes certain groups from reproduction.To explain “how” gaymen “become aware” that theycan/cannot become parents in heteronormative soci‐eties, we were inspired by qualitative studies. Marsiglioand Hutchinson (2002) introduced the term “procreativeconsciousness” to conceptualise how men understandthemselves as procreative and nurturing beings throughsexual and romantic relations and fertility‐related events.Others explored howprocreative consciousness emergesamong gay men in the absence of a direct fertilityexperience through adoption agencies, fertility clinics,and a bureaucracy that mediates access to parenthood(Berkowitz & Marsiglio, 2007). Murphy (2013) used thesame concept to explore the pathways of Americanand Australian gay men towards surrogacy, revealingSocial Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 125that among the sources of their procreative conscious‐ness were the promotional strategies of surrogacy agen‐cies, media, their peers, and partners. Exposure to mes‐sages that promoted gay parenthood enabled them todevelop the procreative consciousness that had previ‐ously been unavailable to them. The findings are context‐specific and show that parenting desires are sociallyinformed and enacted through available discourses andresources. Exploring the emergence of procreative con‐sciousness among gay men in much less advanced coun‐tries in terms of LGBTQ+ rights, such as Czechia, ismissing. Thus, by exploring Czech gay men’s experienceswith the use of “parental consciousness”—a conceptbased on procreative consciousness that captures thevariety of pathways to parenthood beyond biogeneticreproduction—our study contributes to filling the knowl‐edge gap on gay men’s raising awareness of themselvesas parenting persons outside advanced societies regard‐ing LGBTQ+ rights.Overall, our mixed‐methods study examines thetopic of childlessness, parenting desires, intentions,and barriers to non‐straight parenthood through thelens of heteronormativity. Heteronormativity is basedon the assumption of two complementary genders as“normal,’’ “natural,” and “ideal.” From the heteronor‐mative perspective, being gay is associated with child‐lessness (Berkowitz & Marsiglio, 2007), and gay fathersare faced with “dual stigmatisation” associated withthe belief in the “naturalness” of heterosexual parent‐hood and the belief that men do not have a “natural’’caregiving ability and cannot be as competent at par‐enting as women (Stacey, 2006). Heteronormativitymanifests in a set of processes to re/produce het‐erosexuality on legal, cultural, structural, institutional,interactional, discursive, and individual levels (Lasioet al., 2020). Kimmel (2003) defines heteronormativ‐ity as an interplay of four social dynamics: misogyny(which marginalises femininity), bipolarisation (whichmarginalises non‐heterosexualities), essentialism (whichconstructs heteronormativity and the resulting marginal‐isation of non‐heterosexuality as “natural”), and reli‐gious prejudices. Although the last is relatively weakin Czechia, the Czech conservative gender regime and(internalised) homophobia (as signs of heteronormativ‐ity) have been fuelled by the medicalisation of sexualityvia sexology in the 20th century, which also strengthenedthe essentialising and bipolar substance of heteronorma‐tivity (Lišková, 2018; Sloboda, 2021; Sokolová, 2021).While LGBTQ+ movements have changed the “land‐scapes” of heteronormativity and transformed the insti‐tutions regulating non‐straight sexualities in some soci‐eties (Roseneil et al., 2013), heteronormativity remainsstrongly institutionalised through legal and social bar‐riers to same‐sex parenthood in Czechia and its neigh‐bouring post‐socialist countries (European Commission,2019; ILGA‐Europe, 2021; Takács & Szalma, 2020). Theirgovernments have applied selective pronatalist policiesto protect such values as heteronormativity and eth‐nic and national belonging. While supporting the fertil‐ity and parenthood of some persons, they hinder thefertility and parenthood of others via limited accessto assisted reproductive technologies, adoptions, child‐care support, and legal definitions of parents and fami‐lies (Hašková & Dudová, 2021; Takács, 2018). Our studythus also contributes to the knowledge about how gaymen’s parenting aspirations are shaped by a particularpost‐socialist context.3. ContextIn Europe, post‐socialist countries are in general lessaccepting of LGBTQ+ rights, with Czechia doing bettercompared to many neighbouring post‐socialist countries(European Commission, 2019). Civil unions have openedfor same‐sex couples in Czechia, Slovenia, Hungary, andCroatia but not in Poland and Slovakia. In Czechia,gays/lesbians are allowed to adopt children individuallyand, in contrast to Poland, research suggests this rightis not to be circumvented in Czechia (Nešporová, 2021).However, joint adoptions by same‐sex couples andstep‐child adoptions in same‐sex couples have remainedforbidden in Czechia, like in neighbouring post‐socialistcountries. Although neither assisted reproduction for les‐bian couples nor surrogacy is legislated for same‐sexcouples in post‐socialist countries, there is research evi‐dence of these practices, and, in Czechia, the knowledgeon how to proceed at fertility clinics is widely sharedamong lesbians (Nešporová, 2021). In same‐sex families,though, only one of the parents has parental rights andobligations, while their same‐sex partner remains legallyunrecognised as a parent in Czechia (Burešová, 2020).Some gaymen opt formultiparenting (Nešporová, 2021);yet again, no legal provisions for such families exist inCzechia (Burešová, 2020).Sokolová (2009) found that gay men in Czechia whogrew up under state socialism usually did not comeout until long after they had children in a heterosexualrelationship, while younger gay men typically came outbefore they reached the average reproductive age. As thestate socialist regime ostracised and stigmatised homo‐sexuality (Sokolová, 2021), it made it difficult for gay mento think about intimate relations outside the heteronor‐mative condition. Despite persisting stigmatisation, atti‐tudes towards LGBTQ+ rights have been improving inCzechia and coming out has become much easier in thelast twodecadeswith same‐sex parenting being positivelyportrayed in themedia in the last decade (Sloboda, 2021).In contrast, Hungary has experienced a strong neo‐conservative nationalist backslide towards LGBTQ+ rightssince 2010 (Kováts, 2021). In religious Poland, LGBTQ+and gender ideology are defined as a threat to thenation (Graff & Korolczuk, 2021), and a similar trendwas observed in Slovakia (Guasti & Bustikova, 2020).Although negative attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights andvisibility are identifiable all across the post‐socialistregion (Graff & Korolczuk, 2021), which is fuelled bySocial Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 126anti‐Western sentiments (Kováts, 2021), Czechia hasremained relatively untouched by this (Sloboda, 2021).Nevertheless, homophobia persists in Czechia. It mani‐fests itself in the fewer than two in three Czechs agreeingwith step‐child adoptions in same‐sex families and onlyless than half approving of same‐sex marriage or jointadoptions by same‐sex couples (Spurný, 2019).Gay fatherhood is moreover constrained by gender‐conservative essentialising attitudes of Czechs towardsparenting and gendered familialist policies that cementmothers as primary caregivers and constrain men’s par‐ticipation in care (Lutherová et al., 2017). In Czechia,mothers’ long, full‐time, intensive childcare and separategender roles in families with preschool children are dom‐inantly practised, leaving little space for fathers to partic‐ipate in care (Lutherová et al., 2017).Besides Sokolová’s (2009) qualitative study of Czechgay parenting desires, only a few studies focused onthe topic within the neighbouring post‐socialist coun‐tries. They include mainly convenience sample surveysof non‐straight people and rarely address both desiresand intentions. Polish mixed‐method study that startedin 2013 (Mizielińska et al., 2015; Mizielińska & Stasińska,2018) showed very low positive parenting intentions ofgay men (5% contrasting to almost a quarter among les‐bians) and a share of fathers among them (5%). Morethan half of those planning to have a child consideredsurrogacy and raising the child in a same‐sex couple, lessthan a third considered adoption, while other optionsreceived much less support. In Slovenia, almost 40% ofgay men desired to have children, with younger onesmore often postponing the decision and older onesexpressing more often resignation to parenthood (Švab,2007). In Croatia, researchers found lower parentingdesires in gay men (48%) compared to bisexual men(58%) and a preference for adoptions/foster care oversurrogacy, with raising a child in a heterosexual relation‐ship being the least preferred (Štambuk et al., 2019).In Hungary, before individual adoptions were bannedin 2021, Háttér Társaság (2017) indicated an increasingshare of non‐straight people wishing to parent with solidsupport for adoptions among gay men. Despite the factthat the samples andmethods of these studies differ, theshort overview indicates that there are country‐specificdifferences in the region.4. Data and MethodsWe apply a parallel mixed‐methods research with a mainfocus on qualitative enquiry. While quantitative enquirymaps the outline of gay men’s parenting desires, inten‐tions, and barriers to their parenthood, the qualitativeanalysis explores their experiences andmeanings of (not)becoming parents. Qualitative data alone could not pro‐vide enough information on the scope of gay men’s par‐enting desires and intentions and the extent to whichthey differ from men declaring other than gay identities.In contrast, quantitative data alone could not provideenough insight into gay men’s experiences and mean‐ings of childlessness and constrained pathways to parent‐hood. In both enquiries, we applied a broad definition ofparenthood that includes procreating and raising a childwho is genetically one’s own, adopted, a partner’s, or inone’s long‐term foster care.Considering it is difficult to collect a representativesample of persons with non‐normative sexual identi‐ties, studies have mostly relied on convenience sam‐ples (e.g., Baiocco & Laghi, 2013; Carneiro et al., 2017;Costa & Bidell, 2017). In Czechia, there are no rele‐vant census data, and general population surveys haveproduced extremely small samples of non‐straight men.In the absence of a sampling frame for a representativesurvey of persons with non‐normative sexual identities,we opted for an online survey using the representativeCzech National Panel in 2019. We asked 25,000 respon‐dents aged 25–49 (95% of people of this age use theinternet every day; see CZSO, 2019) to complete a screen‐ing questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics,including sexual identity. The screening clarified the dis‐tribution of persons by declared gender, sexual identity,place of residence, and age, helping us determine thequotas for our main sample that were allowed to pro‐ceed with the full questionnaire. As we focused on per‐sons with non‐normative sexual identities, those declar‐ing exclusively heterosexual identities were excluded.Themain sample thus consisted of self‐declared gaymen,lesbians, bisexual persons, persons declaring heterosex‐ual identity with romantic/sexual attraction to the same‐sex person in the last five years (predominantly straight),and persons declaring “other” identities. Given that wefocus on men in this article, the analysed weighteddataset consisted of 129 predominantly straight men,125 bisexual men, and 165 gay men. Another 22 menwho declared “other” identities were excluded fromthe sample because this was probably a heterogeneousgroup that could not be merged with any other groupnor analysed separately because of the small size of thegroup. The final sample of 419 men allows only descrip‐tive statistics; yet, it is on a topic that has not yet beenmapped in Czechia and the results complement the qual‐itative data.Our qualitative enquirywas based on semi‐structuredinterviews with 23 self‐identified gay men aged 25–47years in 2018–2020; nine of them were raising childrenand 14 were childless/childfree. They lived in a range ofsettlements from small villages to large cities, and theireducation ranged from apprenticeship to college. Theinterviews were on average 1.5 hours long and were tran‐scribed verbatim. The interviewees’ names are fictitious.The interviewees were askedwhether theywere con‐sidering having a child in the future or had raised/wereraising a child already. We then encouraged them toexplain their reasons for (not) considering a child in thepast/future and to explain the pathways and barriersto parenthood considered/experienced. Subsequently,we asked them about their childhood, formation ofSocial Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 127non‐straight identities, coming out, job and relationshiptrajectories, issues related to (pathways to) parenthood,discrimination, support networks, and engagement inLGBTQ+ movements.The analysis included several steps. We started withthematic analysis. Three of the authors were codingthe first nine interviews independently. Subsequently,we discussed the codes (repeatedly identified themes),produced a list of 45 codes and their “families,” andthen re‐coded these interviews and coded all theremaining interviews in the Atlas.ti software programusing the list. For example, the family of codes “path‐ways to parenthood” included not only codes such as“surrogacy,’’ “adoption,” and “child from previous rela‐tionship,” but also “not/importance of biological par‐enthood,” “not/importance of mother,” etc. Then, wesearched for further relations between the codes todevelop more complex categories such as “decliningparenthood.” Subsequently, we analysed the interviewsas “life‐stories’’ of childlessness or becoming a parent.Although life‐stories accentuate personal experience andsubjectivity, they contribute to the understanding of theformation of life‐paths beyond an individual case (Rustin& Chamberlayne, 2002). Each life‐story represents a frag‐ment within the mosaic of contextualised understand‐ing of gay men’s experience of (not) becoming parents.Finally, we merged our analysis of individual life‐storieswith developed categories to formulate collective stories(Charmaz, 2006). Collective stories do not capture thedetails of individual life‐stories. Theywere constructed tohighlight the main differences in the experience of child‐lessness and barriers to parenthood. In particular, weconstructed collective stories of those who have neverconsidered parenthood as their life option, those whochose to remain childfree, those who remain undecidedwhether to pursue parenthood, and those who havedesired parenthood and considered ways to achieve it.5. Quantitative EnquiryQuantitative data explore the “landscape” of heteronor‐mativity in Czechia by mapping the extent to which par‐enting desires and intentions of self‐identified gay mendiffer from those self‐identified as bisexual or predomi‐nantly straight and by mapping the perceived barriers togay parenthood.As Czechia belongs to a region known for limitedadvances in LGBTQ+ rights, we expect that only a smallportion of gay men would target parenthood. Our dataare in line with such an assumption. While 78% of thepredominantly straight men found it definitely or ratherimportant to raise children, the same was true for 62%of the enquired bisexual men and only for 26% of gaymen (Figure 1). Yet, social mechanisms leading to thereduced importance of raising children for gay men areto be explored with the qualitative data.As in other countries (Baiocco & Laghi, 2013; Kranzet al., 2018; Riskind & Patterson, 2010), gay men inCzechia too showed smaller parenting desires, inten‐tions, and transitions to parenthood compared to menin the other subcategories (Figure 2): Only 8% of gayrespondents were fathers in contrast to 48% of bisexualmen and 61% of predominantly straightmen. In addition,65% of gay men respondents reported not wanting chil‐dren compared to only 25% of their bisexual and 12%of their predominantly straight peers. Moreover, the par‐enting desires of Czech gay respondents led to parentingintentions less often compared to the others. What dis‐courses and barriers may contribute to these differencesare to be further explored.78%62%26%9%16%27%13%22%47%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Predominantly straight men Bisexual men Gay menDefinitely/ratherimportantNeither important norunimportantDefinitely/ratherunimportantFigure 1.

Parenthood, parenting desires and intentions, by men’s sexual identities. Note: Chi‐square test is statistically sig‐nificant (Sig. = 0.000).In all the three subcategories of respondents, con‐ception in a heterosexual relationship was the most fre‐quent pathway to fatherhood. Asmany as 60% of the chil‐dren of gay respondents were brought into the world inthis way. This may reflect the plasticity of sexual identi‐ties, difficulties of declaring one’s gayness, and inacces‐sibility of other pathways to parenthood for gay men.The last reason is supported by the fact that the majorityof gay respondents who wanted one/an additional childdid not consider getting the child in a heterosexual rela‐tionship. Despite the small number of respondents, ourdata also imply that Czech gaymen show neither a strongpreference for biological children nor for a single path‐way to parenthood (including adoption, surrogacy, fostercare, heterosexual relationship, multiparenting, and rais‐ing their partner’s children from their previous relation‐ships). Akin to other men, parenting with their partnersis themost considered childcare arrangement by gaymen(91%), followed by parentingwith the help of one’s family(58%) andmultiparenting (42%),while solo parenting andparenting with friends are the least considered options.Although in late‐modern societies, people are sup‐posed to decide rather freely whether to start a familyand, indeed, 92%of predominantly straightmen feel freeto choose, the same applies only to 87% of bisexual menand 69% of gay men (Figure 3).A few percentage points more gay respondents areconsistently single (23%) and fewer gay respondentshave long‐termmonogamous relationships compared toother respondents; yet, the differences are not statis‐tically significant. Therefore, relationship status cannotexplain the differences found in parenting desires, inten‐tions, and perceived freedom of choice. A range of barri‐ers to parenthood perceived by gay men seems to betterexplain such differences (Figure 4).Topmost amongst the list of factors influencing gaymen’s parenting intentions is their partnership situationwith their economic situation also playing an importantrole for many. However, before the economic situation,almost 50% of gay men declare the impact of legal uncer‐tainty of same‐sex families on their parenting intentions.Moreover, legal uncertainty of multiparenting, fear oflow acceptance of the child by society, and conditionsof surrogacy are also mentioned as influential by a signif‐icant portion of the participating gay men. In short, gaymen consider the mainstream factors influencing theirparenting intentions and, by and large, the barriers spe‐cific to gay men on top of that.6. Qualitative EnquiryThe qualitative enquiry examines how gaymen reflect on(not) becoming parents. First, three collective stories ofchildlessness are analysed. Second, barriers to gay path‐ways to parenthood are discussed.6.1. Childlessness as a GivenThe quantitative analysis showed a substantial group ofgay men wishing no children. The interviews illuminatewhy. Some gay men construct their childlessness as a“given,” a “matter of course”:Social Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 12992%87%69%0%4%5%8% 9%31%0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Predominantly straightmenBisexual men Gay menDefinitely/ratheragreeDon't knowDefinitely/ratherdisagreeFigure 3. Perceived freedom to decide whether to become a parent, by men’s sexual identities; percentages were calcu‐lated based on answers to the question: Would you say, about yourself, that you are free to decide whether to become aparent? Note: Chi‐square test is statistically significant (Sig. = 0.000).I think I can’t be a parent due to my orientation….Itwould also be against nature to be a parent when I’mwho I am. (Juraj, age 40, single)If nature had wantedme to have children, it probablywouldn’t have made me what it made me. (Nomád,age 40, partnered)These gay men’s rejection of parenthood refers to the“biologising discourse” of intimate relations. Their con‐siderations are informed by the privilege of heterosex‐uality over homosexuality achieved in this discourse byattaching significance to linkages between parenthoodand reproduction by heterosexual intercourse and byconstructing manhood and womanhood as two comple‐mentary halves of a “natural” whole. Their experiencemay be described in terms of internalised homonega‐tivity, manifested by self‐stigmatization and internaliza‐tion of negative societal attitudes towards homosexual‐ity into the system of one’s self‐concept, as a result ofprocesses of minority stress (Shenkman et al., 2019).However, as Kamil (age 40, partnered) shows below,the essentialising gendered view of caregivers is yetanother aspect of heteronormativity that represents animportant barrier to gay men’s parenting desires:I don’t know how a man, or two men, should takecare of a child. It’s the mother who takes care in themovies and fairy tales, she is the caregiver.Kamil refers to the pronounced cultural belief in Czechiathat women are always the caregivers and that femalebodies/minds are better equipped for childcare (Lišková,2018). When accepting this view, gay men do not per‐ceive themselves as those who should become parents.The norm of heterosexuality and the essentialising gen‐dered view of caregivers block the emergence of theirparental consciousness. They expect permanent child‐lessness as a “natural” outcome of their non‐normativesexual identity and assumed lack of disposition to care.These strains of heteronormativity contribute to produc‐ing childlessness as a given in the views of these gaymen;they lack the discourses for raising parental conscious‐ness and thus cannot choose parenthood.6.2. Childlessness as a ChoiceOther gaymen view their childlessness as a consequenceof “liberation” from a “duty to become parents” ratherthan a perceived “inability” to procreate and care. Theirnarratives suggest that homosexuality can be viewed asa source of greater freedom than heterosexuality regard‐ing the social pressure to become parents:In childhood…no one wanted children….But I knewthat one day I’d grow up and have children after all,but it’s not like I wanted it….It developed to the pointthat I never wanted children, that I’m content not tohave to. [For gay men], not wanting a child is proba‐bly easier to defend, work with, or live with. If I wasstraight and had to get a wife, a wife who might wanta child, then I would be under greater pressure tohave one.

Factors in the view of gay men that have affected their parenting intentions.For these gay men, childlessness is a preferred way oflife allowing them to focus on their professional careers,childfree relationships, hobbies, or a combination ofthese. They may be aware of their potential of becom‐ing parents. Their childlessness does not relate to anabsence of parental consciousness. Just as childless gaymenwho lack parental consciousness and see their child‐lessness as “naturally” given, childfree gay men considertheir childlessness as a permanent way of life; but asopposed to the former, they construct this way as theirgenuine choice (e.g., van Houten et al., 2020).6.3. Childlessness as a Life Stage and/or IndecisionOther childless gay men do not perceive their childless‐ness as a given nor do they adopt narratives of childless‐ness as a chosenway of life. Likemany heterosexual child‐less men (Maříková, 2021), they view their childlessnessSocial Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 131as unintended (but not given) or they are (still) unde‐cided about their pursuit of parenthood. “Being unde‐cided” relates primarily to younger gay men (mainlyunder the age of 30 years):It’s something I’ve been thinking about more oftenthanbefore but it’s not something I have clarity about.(Erik, age 25, single)I don’t know, I haven’t felt the need to have childrenso far, nor do I feel one at the moment, but I supposethis will change within a couple of years. (Jáchym,age 30, intermittently partnered)It’s a bit hard for me to tell if my reasons are rational‐isations of the fact that I’m being prevented by exter‐nal circumstances…orwhether they are a result ofmyway of thinking. But I believe there are economic rea‐sons and I’m not sure if the relationship I’m in…wouldbe good enough to take care of a child. (Boris, age 26,partnered)From a biographical perspective, they are still in the pro‐cess of clarifying their orientation in life; they thematisethe absence or quality of partnership, issues of studyand work, and housing and financial insecurity—just astheir heterosexual peers do (Maříková, 2021). In addi‐tion, they may face difficult relationships with their par‐ents following coming out that may hinder decisionsabout parenthood in relation to minority stress‐relatedavoidance of intimacy (Shenkman et al., 2019) and antic‐ipated lack of support (Mizielińska & Stasińska, 2018).From a generational perspective, they do not share therather older gay men’s a priori denial of gay parenthood.While conscious of their parental potential, they remainundecided about whether to pursue parenthood. Theydo not identify with permanent childlessness: Eitherthey do not (yet) view parenthood as personally rele‐vant or they view parenthood as a potential way laterin life.6.4. Barriers to Different Pathways to ParenthoodIn their narratives, many gay men detail their considera‐tions of different pathways to parenthood, although theyhave often resulted in perpetual/permanent postpone‐ment of parenthood. Only some accounted for real stepstaken towards parenthood, some of which again failed toachieve their goals.A few gaymen in their 40s stated that their parentingdesire had motivated them to have a child in a hetero‐sexual relationship. Yet for none of the younger gay menwho did consider parenthood, the pathway implied keep‐ing their gay status a secret. This is in line with the quanti‐tative data that indicated thatmost gay respondentswhowanted a child did not consider a heterosexual relation‐ship. Cyril’s (age 27, partnered) quote below illustratessuch a generational shift. Although barriers to gay parent‐hood remain enormous, given the (LGBTQ+ movementdriven) increase in knowledge about same‐sex familiesand the legislative and social acceptance of same‐sexcouples, young gay men’s contemplation of future par‐enthood is no longer compulsorily linked to different‐sexcouple life:I know people who have completely covered up theirtrue orientation to have their family….I considered itbut…such a life probably does not have the quality itshould have.Similarly, both types of data indicate that partner‐ship plays a major role in gay men’s parenting inten‐tions. In their narratives, the gay men thematised theabsence/existence of a partnership, its quality, and theirpartner’s parenting preparedness. The last was empha‐sised as few gay partners may be prepared for parent‐hood given the low share and visibility of fathers amonggay men. Although the country’s heteronormative legalsystem does not allow two men to become a child’s par‐ents, Czech gay men (akin to heterosexuals) prefer thebiparental model over solo parenting:A child requires some security, you can have that withyour significant other, I can’t imagine having a childon my own. (Tomáš, age 36, partnered)I could not make it on my own…also timewise…whenthere’s a couple…the other person can fill in for you.(Karel, age 41, single)Adoption and surrogacy are their preferred means tostart a biparental family while multiparenting (like soloparenting contradicting the biparental model) is less pre‐ferred. As for multiparenting, they pursue the more orless extensive parental role. The extensive role includes,for example, shared custody whereby the child spendsalternating periods in the gay father’s and the biologicalmother’s families. The minimal role foresees, for exam‐ple, being a distant biological father and getting irregu‐larly involved in childcare.The absence of legal regulation of same‐sex par‐enthood was considered a major barrier to gay par‐enthood. The men emphasised that only one of themcould become the child’s parent, while the other partnerwould remain devoid of any parental rights and obliga‐tions. They realistically anticipated problems due to suchlegal regulations combined with anticipated prejudicesagainst gay parenthood:This is a huge problem…that only one can be the par‐ent. This means that the child is cut off from half oftheir rights…inheritance, but also a representation ofthat child. Even if there are powers of attorney, aright cannot be 100% replaced by that. (Kamil, age 41,partnered)Social Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 132The gaymenwhowere considering the pursuit of parent‐hood were weighing the pros and cons of different path‐ways to that goal. Although the interviews suggest thatadoption tends to be the initial consideration, many gaymen are reluctant to accept a biologically unrelated childwho would have a disadvantaged start in life:For adoptions, I am worried that…there is no auto‐matic feeling that this is my child. (Boris, age 26,partnered)Some also anticipated prejudices from the adoptionbureaucracy, but adoptive gay fathers did not confirmsuch prejudices either in our study or in a recent study ofgay and lesbian families by Nešporová (2021). Eventually,adoptionwas only considered by thosewho did not insiston biological fatherhood and wanted to help an exist‐ing child.Surrogacy was only considered following thoroughmapping or failed pursuit of other pathways to par‐enthood, a process accompanied by a growing desireto have biological children; however, many gay menfound surrogacy unacceptable as “shopping” for childrenor “a breach of the bond” between biological motherand child:A child is not a thing that you buy at a supermarket orthrough an arrangement with someone: “Look, youwill carry my baby, I will then take it.” (Tadeáš, age 29,partnered)Surrogacy can’t have a good influence either on thebaby or on the children in the surrogatemother’s fam‐ily….The baby must sense being handed over by itsmother. (Kamil, age 41, partnered)I do not want to create a child in an unnaturalway….Regarding surrogacy…I cannot afford to pay amother…there are no legal provisions in Czechia and,above all, a woman has certain needs, hormones,potentially complicating the handing over of the child.(David, age 27, partnered)They further emphasised the absence of surrogacy pro‐visions in Czech law and the lack of financial, linguistic,or other resources for the pursuit of surrogacy abroad.Typically realised aftermany years of planning, surrogacywas an option only for stable couples of gay men whodesired their biological children, knew other gay coupleswho had succeeded on this pathway to parenthood andhad the above resources at their disposal.Whenmultiparenting was declined, this was typicallyin the context of the child‐raising norms of coupledomand parental cohabitation. More than two parents andone household were considered confusing for the childand associated with difficult negotiations between morethan two partners:I know how difficult it is to negotiate with two people,let alone three people….Disputes between theparentsare the worst thing the child can experience….I knowgay families of three or four adults…there are disagree‐ments…it is ideal when a child is raised by two people.(Kamil, age 41, partnered)Real steps towards multiparenting were taken only bythose willing to transgress the coupledom norm andview the existence of more involved parents as moreresources for the child, rather than confusion. However,some told us that their pathways to multiparenting hadfailed because they wanted a greater stake in childcarethan that offered by the prospective multiparenting les‐bian couple:Our idea was that we would be fully involved in thatparenting…and the idea of the lesbian couple wasthat wewould be involved just a little bit. It started tobe a drama…then they said “no.” (Libor, age 45, part‐nered, children bornwith the same surrogate abroad)Compared to heterosexuals, gay men’s pathways to par‐enthood are typically more complicated, longer, andnegotiated with more people. The negotiations involveinstitutions in the case of adoption, a surrogate mother,a co‐parenting lesbian mother/couple, and the like.All this renders the pathways highly planned, multilater‐ally negotiated, and consequently more prone to the riskof permanent postponement of parenthood. One has toovercome more obstacles and reconcile more intereststhan in the case of an unassisted conception by a hetero‐sexual couple:Many people in straight couples also feel they can’tafford a child, or [that] their relationship is notready…but to us, it can’t just happen. We are muchmore obliged to consider this and take rationalsteps….My pathway to parenthood is also influencedby the sense of having to be the perfect parent….It’sanother thing when having a child is a rational deci‐sion. (Boris, age 26, partnered)In sum, parenting desires and intentions are conditionalupon the existence of parental consciousness, whichhas grown in the new generation of gay men. However,their parenting desires and intentions often do not resultin actual parenthood because of the severe barriersto their parenthood, leading them to postpone parent‐hood permanently.The interviews also revealed important intersec‐tional differences among gay men—concerning not onlygeneration but also socioeconomic standing. High costsmake surrogacy available only for gay men with highincomes. Moreover, given the geographic location of sur‐rogacy agencies and the legal complexities of surrogacy,surrogacy seems also limited by communication skills.Moreover, multiparenting negotiations reflect the socialSocial Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 133location of all potential parents too, which is strength‐ened by the fact that a positive approach to multiparent‐ing is mostly related to the notion of increased resourcesfor the child. Similarly to Takács (2018), we may thusview gay parenthood as a feature of socioeconomic privi‐lege, whilemost gaymenwishing for parenthood remaindeprived of it.7. Discussion and ConclusionAkin to the foreign studies (Baiocco & Laghi, 2013; Kranzet al., 2018; Riskind & Patterson, 2010; Riskind & Tornello,2017), our quantitative data show that gaymen in Czechiadiffer from bisexual men and predominantly straightmenin terms of significantly lower parenting desires, inten‐tions, and transitions to parenthood. The data also indi‐cated that Czech gaymen turn their parenting desires intoparenting intentions less often than bisexual and predom‐inantly straight men and less often feel free to choosewhether to become a parent. This relates to a legal uncer‐tainty of same‐sex families in Czechia (Burešová, 2020)being perceived as one of the major barriers to parent‐hood by gay men and highlights the impact of heteronor‐mative state regulations on the relational lives of personswith non‐normative sexual identities. Compared to leg‐islative barriers, fears of low acceptance of a child in soci‐ety and opinions of those surrounding gay men did notmatter as much in their parenting intentions. Althougheven their impact must not be underestimated, theirlower rating may reflect that the neoconservative back‐slide towards the rights of LGBTQ+people observed in thepost‐socialist region (Graff & Korolczuk, 2021) may havebeen less pronounced in Czechia.Additionally, our quantitative and qualitative datacomplemented each other in showing that akin to het‐erosexual men (e.g., Zhang, 2011), Czech gay men attachthe greatest importance to their partnership situationbecause they also prefer to become parents while havinga partner. Rejection of solo parenthood could be indica‐tive of a conservative view of the family (in Czechia, how‐ever, not as a result of religiosity). The interviews showthis rejection to be more a result of the need for sup‐port though, in terms of practicalities (time, resources)and to overcome the stigma of gay parenthood thatman‐ifests in the minority‐related stress to undertake per‐fect parenthood.Moreover, in the conservative gender regime inCzechia (based on the essentialisation of gender rela‐tions and the societal support for separate gender rolesin families), all men are directed into the role of thesecondary caregiver (Lutherová et al., 2017). This belief(even institutionalised in policies discouraging men fromparticipating in care) contributes to the internalisation ofthe view of gay families as less competent in parentingand compromises gay men’s parenting desires.To better explain Czech gay men’s low parentingdesires and the generational shift in their approach toparenthood while embracing the variety of (considered)pathways to gay fatherhoodbeyondbiogenetic reproduc‐tion, we deployed the concept of parental consciousnessinspired by the concept of procreative consciousness(Berkowitz & Marsiglio, 2007; Murphy, 2013). The collec‐tive stories of childlessness illuminated how gay men’sparenting desires are conditioned by their parental con‐sciousness. Some (older) gay men internalised the beliefthat their sexual orientation is in contradiction with par‐enthood. In some countries, religiosity partially accountsfor the negative beliefs about gay families (Costa & Bidell,2017; Lasio et al., 2020) but in highly secularised Czechia,such beliefs are historically anchored in the biologis‐ing discourse on intimate relations (Lišková, 2018) andthe related essentialising gendered view of caregiving(Sokolová, 2021). Qualitative data thus show how theabsence of parenting desires may be coming from socio‐cultural contexts (Shenkman et al., 2021).Besides those whose heteronormatively prescribedlack of parental consciousness translated into the beliefin their childlessness as given, we identified childfree gaymen who defined their gayness as a source of freedomfrom the social pressure to become parents and thosewho remain undecided whether, how, and when to pur‐sue parenthood. The indecision may last long becausegay pathways to parenthood are highly planned, multi‐laterally negotiated, and full of institutional barriers, and,as a result, at risk of permanent postponement.Even if sharing knowledge of pathways to gay par‐enthood becomes a resource for increasing parental con‐sciousness of younger gay men, legal conditions remaincrucial for increasing their real‐life options. Moreover,due to the intricacies of gay men’s pathways to parent‐hood, gay men seem to be divided more than others intheir access to parenthood by their socioeconomic stand‐ing as was documented by Takács (2018) for Hungary.In the end, we see that very few Czech gay men pursueparenthood, and only a handful of them actually achievetheir goal.While Sokolová (2009) captured the shift in the tim‐ing of coming out in relation to parenthood, we capturedthe shift in parental consciousness of Czech gay men.While the older generation had to choose either father‐hood while keeping their gayness a secret or accept theirgay lives as inherently childless, younger generations(currently in the reproductive age) seem to be consciousof the various types of openly gay parenthood.This trend is in line with the studies for Poland(Mizielińska et al., 2015), Croatia (Štambuk et al., 2019),and Hungary (Háttér Társaság, 2017), wherein it wasfound that although most children in same‐sex fami‐lies were born in one of the parents’ previous opposite‐sex relationship, young gay men and lesbians preferother ways to parenthood. Despite the severe barriersto gay parenthood persist in these countries, informa‐tion on same‐sex families is becoming more accessible.Moreover, as Sloboda (2021) shows, same‐sex parent‐ing has been positively portrayed in the Czech media inthe last decade (in contrast to Hungary; cf. Takács, 2018),Social Inclusion, 2022, Volume 10, Issue 3, Pages 124–137 134which could have contributed to increased parental con‐sciousness among Czech gay men.The fact that neither the quantitative nor the qual‐itative data indicated either a clear preference for theonly pathway to parenthood or any clear preferencefor biological fatherhood among gay men may relate tothe context‐specific barriers to the various pathways togay parenthood. In contrast to some contexts (Murphy,2013), promotional strategies of surrogacy agencies areremote for Czechs (geographically and language‐wise)and surrogacy abroad is demanding and costly. Thiscould partly explain why Czech gay men do not showany clear preference for biological fatherhood. Genderedessentialising belief in the importance of the mother inearly childhood could also contribute to the distancing ofgay men from surrogacy in particular.Yet, in the context of other post‐socialist countries,such as Poland, with its severe social and legal barri‐ers to gay parenthood, a much stronger preference forsurrogacy over adoption has been identified among gaymen (Mizielińska et al., 2015). This might be becauseadoptions by gay men seem to be easier in Czechia thanin Poland. Czech Constitutional Court repealed the pre‐vious provision prohibiting adoption by a person in acivil union, which received wide attention in the media(Hašková & Sloboda, 2018). Nešporová (2021) also docu‐ments that Czech gay men do not have to hide their part‐ners during the adoption process. In contrast to Poland,preference for adoptions was identified also in Croatia(Štambuk et al., 2019). In this respect, our research alsocontributes to the knowledge about how geo‐temporalconditions shape LGBTQ+ relational lives in yet anothercontext beyond the dominant Western understandingof queer kinship (e.g., Mizielińska & Stasińska, 2018).Comparative international research is needed to explaincountry differences, though.Among the main limitations of our study are the lim‐ited number of respondents and the absence of exclu‐sively heterosexual men in the quantitative enquiry.While the limited number of respondents allowed fordescriptive analyses only, the other limitation did notallow direct comparison with exclusively heterosex‐ual men. Moreover, the focus on men alone doesnot allow potentially useful comparisons by gender.Finally, researchers in future should pursue internationalresearch to allow a direct comparison of how the vari‐ety of post‐socialist gender regimes (in their Hungarianpopulist‐nationalist, Polish and Slovak Catholicising, orCzech essentialising versions) shape the relational livesof persons with non‐normative identities.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the three anonymous reviewers for their con‐structive comments on themanuscript.

    "abstract": "This mixed‐methods article focuses on childlessness and barriers to parenthood among non‐heterosexual men in Czechia. On the quantitative sample of 419 men (165 gays, 125 bisexuals, and 129 heterosexuals with same‐sex romantic/sexual attraction), recruited on a representative online panel, we map the parenting desires, intentions, and perceived barriers to parenthood. Our analysis identifies a substantial group of gay men without parenting desires and intentions compared to heterosexuals and bisexuals, and the lack of legal recognition of same‐sex families as a crucial barrier to gay parenthood. The qualitative enquiry, based on semi‐structured interviews with 23 self‐identified gay men aged 25 to 47 years, explores how they reflect on (not) becoming parents and contextualises those reflections. The deployed concept of \"parental consciousness\" captures the variety of considered pathways to gay parenthood and proves itself useful in understanding the low parenting desires and a generational shift among Czech gay men. We argue that men able to come out in their early adulthood in the post‐socialist context tend to have more diversified perspectives on possible pathways to parenthood. Among gaymen without children, we identified three distinct perceptions of the state: given childlessness, chosen childfree life, and a life stage/indecision. The informants pursuing parenthood have seen identity‐specific barriers to parenthood as crucial, which is discussed in the context of state selective regulations of the relational lives of persons with non‐normative identities. Although Czech gay men's parental consciousness has increased, legal conditions remain crucial for increasing their real‐life options",
