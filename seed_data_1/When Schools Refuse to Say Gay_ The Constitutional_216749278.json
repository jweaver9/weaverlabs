McGovern*\nThe wave of very public Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and\nQueer (LGBTQ) youth suicides in recent years has become a source of\nnational attention. As a result, many parents, teachers, school boards\nand even the federal government have sought solutions to protect\nLGBTQ young people. There has been very little attention, however,\ngiven to a number of formal state and local so-called \"no-promo-homo\"\npolicies that formally proscribe a hostile, unwelcome, and unconstitu-\ntionally restrictive environment for LGBTQ youth in school.\nIn seven states and number of localities, these so-called \"no-promo-\nhomo\" policies explicitly prohibit teachers from discussing LGBTQ1\nlives and histories to students, even to address bullying. This note ar-\ngues that no-promo-homo policies are unconstitutional for the social\nmeaning that they convey, the widespread stigmatization they create\nagainst LGBTQ youth, and the unequal treatment that they encourage\ntowards LGBTQ communities.\nAs a result, advocates should rigorously challenge these policies in\ncourt and couple that litigation with rigorous educational advocacy that\nteaches tolerance and acceptance in schools, similar to the policies cre-\nated by California's new FAIR Education law. The alternative is grim,\n* J.D. Candidate, Cornell Law School, 2013; B.A. magna cum laude, Cornell Univer-\nsity, 2008. 1 would like to thank Professors Michael C. Dorf and Sidney G.

Although\nthis backlash presents a significant point of concern for LGBTQ people\ngenerally, LGBTQ youth are at a unique disadvantage by virtue of their\nsocial isolation, inaccessibility to role models, and the tacit approval that\n2 FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, IATE CRIME STATISTICS, 2009 Table 1 (2010),\nhttp://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc20O9/index.html; NATIONAL COALITION oF ANTI-VIOLENCE PRO-\nGRAMS, VIoLENcE AGAINST GAY, BISEXUAL, TRANSGENDER, QUEER, AND HIV-AFFECTED\nCOMMUNrrES (\"LGBTH VIOLENcE REPORT\") 7, 17 (2011), http://www.avp.org/documents/\nNCAVPHateViolenceReport201 I Finaledjlfinaledits.pdf (reporting a 13% increase in hate vio-\nlence on the basis of sexual orientation from 2009 to 2010); see also Lee Romney, Hate\nCrimes Against Gay, Transgender People Rise, Report Says, L.A.

In at least\nseven states, and a number of localities, school districts and state govern-\nments have adopted so-called \"no-promo-homo\" or \"don't-say-gay\" poli-\ncies.10 Under the harshest of these policies, teachers may only discuss\nLGBTQ people in class if they are portrayed as immoral, unhappy, or\ndisease-prone. 1i\n3 See Jason D.P.

This demographic is more likely to be open, and\nat a younger age, than any generation before them.' 3 As a result, they\nhave also become more visible as targets. Their openness has garnered\nnational attention and inspired a vocal counter-movement intent on lob-\nbying against laws and other initiatives that affirm, validate, and support\nAmerica's LGBTQ young lives.14\nPart I outlines the dangers LGBTQ youth face in their struggle for\ninclusion, acceptance, and tolerance in school. By understanding the\nways in which harassment, bullying, and school-sanctioned intolerance\npromote these dangers, the need for a solution will become clear. Part II\nexplores the policies themselves, explaining both the literal and social\nmeaning that such policies convey. This section draws important distinc-\ntions between gender identity and sexual orientation, and gives attention\nto the unique challenges transgender youth face, as well as the unique\nissues that LGBTQ youth of color, particularly those from low-income\nbackgrounds, experience.\nPart III discusses the legal doctrine underlying what some scholars\nhave called an emerging constitutional \"right to be out.\"' 5 This section\nwill apply this right to LGBTQ students in the school setting as it relates\nto no-promo-homo policies. This section will explore the landmark case\nof Tinker v. Des Moines and outline subsequent legal decisions that have\naffirmed and rejected elements of its holding. This section also outlines\narguments against the conservative narrative which asserts that allowing\nLGBTQ students to be open about their identities is a form of \"disruptive\n12 See STUART BIEGEL, THE RIGHT TO BE Our: SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER\nIDEN1ITY IN AMERICA'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS (Univ.

This section will then explore\nthe Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection arguments that have suc-\nceeded in many cases where students have lobbied courts and their\nschool districts to take their rights and their bullying seriously. This sec-\ntion concludes by arguing that, in light of the social meaning behind no-\npromo-homo policies and the emerging right for students to be out, no-\npromo-homo policies are constitutionally intolerable and must be sys-\ntematically challenged and overturned.\nFinally, Section IV discusses recent policy efforts to address\nLGBTQ student rights and argues that in many respects this political\nfight is intensifying, as state legislators continue, even this year, to push\nfor adoption of state-wide no-promo-homo policies. This section empha-\nsizes that legal efforts to strike down these policies on a constitutional\nbasis are necessary, but are also only one part of the struggle in shifting\nour culture of violence and disapproval towards LGBTQ people and\nLGBTQ youth in particular. Specifically, this section outlines federal\nand state initiatives that have been proposed to address LGBTQ youth\nsafety, with a specific focus on California's FAIR Education Act, which\nmade California the first state in the nation to require that public schools\nadopt textbooks which are inclusive of LGBTQ people and other\nmarginalized group histories. This section argues that the fight for\nLGBTQ youth in public schools (even in California) is far from done and\nthat a wide range of initiatives will be necessary to keep LGBTQ youth\nsafe, confident, and alive.\nI. LGBTQ YOUTH BULLYING IN CONTEXT\nAside from hurt feelings and bodies, physical and verbal harassment\ndirected towards LGBTQ youth has led to higher rates of substance\nabuse, sexual risk factors, and a highly publicized wave of LGBTQ\nyouth suicides over the past few years. 16 The social disapproval of\nLGBTQ people that inspires such behavior also accounts for a dispropor-\ntionately high level of suicides in the general LGBTQ population as\nwell.17 LGBTQ youth, like their adult counterparts, are disproportion-\nately more likely to be homeless and susceptible to mental illness and\n16 Daniel Bontempo and Anthony D'Augelli, Effects of At-School Victimization and Sex-\nual Orientation on Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual Youths' Health Risk Behavior 30(5) J.

(In a representative\nstudy, higher levels of an index of violence and victimization were predictive of suicide at-\ntempts. Among LGB youth, suicide attempters have also been found to be more likely than\nnon-attempters to report prior verbal insults, property damage, and physical assaults.).\n4692012]\n470 CORNELL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY [Vol. 22:465\nsubstance abuse as a result of peer and family rejection.' 8 LGBTQ youth\nof color face additional challenges in relation to their white peers, in that\nthey must confront homophobia from within their own racial or ethnic\ngroup, racism from LGBTQ people who identify with other racial or eth-\nnic communities, and endure a combination of both racism and\nhomophobia or transphobia from society at large. 19 Transgender youth\nalso face particular vulnerabilities, especially transgender youth of color,\nas authority figures, including teachers, are almost always complicit in\nthe gender policing perpetrated by peers as a result of their own misun-\nderstanding or bias about transgender identity. No-promo-homo policies\nnot only ignore these issues, they also reaffirm the sense of inferiority\nand disapproval that LGBTQ youth already endure by silencing their ex-\nperiences or explicitly disapproving of them.\nPhysical harassment and violence are a common reality for LGBTQ\nyouth.20 In 2008, Lawrence King, a Latino, gay and gender non-con-\nforming 2' 15-year-old in California was killed after being shot in the\nhead at close range by his classmate one day after coming out as gay in\nschool.22 This past year, an African-American transgender teenager's\ntorso was found in Detroit, burnt nearly beyond recognition, separated\nfrom the rest of her body, in one of many instances of the systemic,\nbrutal violence perpetrated against transgender people, particularly trans-\ngender women of color.23 Finally, in Tennessee, where the state senate\nrecently approved a no-promo-homo bill, 2 4 a 17-year-old white student\nwas allegedly assaulted by his school principal after wearing a t-shirt to\nsupport the creation of his school's first LGBTQ-positive student\n18 See Nat'l Mental Health Ass'n, Bullying in Schools: Harassment Puts Gay Youth at\nRisk, WWW.NMHA.ORG, http://www.nmha.org/go/information/get-info/children-s-mental-\nhealth/bullying-and-gay-youth.\n19 See Jason Cianciotto & Sean Cahill, THE NATIONAL GAY AND LESBIAN TASK FORCE\nPoIcY INsTIrUTE, EDUCATION PouIcY: ISSUES AFFECTING LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND\nTRANSGENDER YOUTH 17 (2003); KEVIN K.

The state of Louisiana's policies exemplify the \"neu-\ntral\" camp of no-homo-policies. In Louisiana, school officials are pro-\nhibited from distributing or discussing \"sexually explicit materials\ndepicting male or female homosexual activity.\"30 In 1994, a Louisiana\nstate court held that the policy was tolerable and that a guide book for\nteachers and parents-encouraging them to \"counsel\" LGB students to\nmake a \"choice that best serves the individual and the community\" and\n\"objectively discuss the wisdom of certain choices\" in relation to their\nidentity-was not a specific attack on same-sex sexual practice.3 ' Like\nLouisiana, South Carolina also requires teachers to remain \"neutral\" by\nprohibiting them from discussing \"alternate sexual lifestyles from hetero-\nsexual relationships including, but not limited to, homosexual relation-\nships\" unless the discussion is in the context of mentioning the risks of\nsexually transmitted diseases. 32 This bill also contains a provision stat-\ning that any teacher who does not comply with the policy will be\nterminated.33\nIn fewer states, legislators very explicitly require school officials to\ncondemn same-sex relationships and LGBTQ people.

Anoka-Hennepin School District No. I1, (No. I 1-cv-01999-\nJNE-SER) (2011).\nWHEN SCHOOLS REFUSE TO \"SAY GAY\"\noutside of the home (where, they argue, such discussions properly be-\nlong), 4 9 it is impossible for LGBTQ students to avoid degrading and un-\nwelcome scrutiny of their sexuality or gender. Harassment, whether\nsevere or mild, both inside and outside of the classroom, impacts\nLGBTQ students' ability to be effective in school. Over 72% of LGBTQ\nstudents surveyed in 2009 reported hearing homophobic remarks, such as\n\"faggot\" or \"dyke\" frequently or often while in school.50 Almost 30% of\nthem missed a class at least once as a result of safety concerns, compared\nto only 8% and 6.7%, respectively of a national sample of secondary\nschool students.5 ' According to the Gay and Lesbian Education Network\n(GLSEN), a leading advocate for LGBTQ-safe schools, the reported\ngrade point average of students who were more frequently harassed be-\ncause of their sexual orientation or gender expression was almost half a\ngrade lower than for students who were less often harassed. 52 Though\nthe policies themselves bear a significant responsibility for limiting the\nability of school officials to take action, the animus against LGBTQ peo-\nple that inspires and justifies their codification is at the root of the issue.\nIII. CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR LGBTQ STUDENTS IN\nSCHOOL: THE RIGHT TO BE OUT\nAn emerging constitutional right to be \"out\" stems from both the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments. 5 3 The First Amendment helps estab-\nlish a right for LGBTQ students to express their sexuality and gender\nexpressions openly, while the Fourteenth Amendment helps ensure that\nstudents are protected, and treated equally, in exercising that freedom.54\nA. Freedom of Expression for Students: Tinker and its Progeny\nIn 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines\nIndependent Community School District55 that individuals do not \"shed\"\ntheir federally guaranteed constitutional rights \"at the schoolhouse\ngate.\" 5 6 The Court held that students and teachers who were disciplined\nfor wearing black armbands in a public school, in protest of the Vietnam\nWar, were entitled to do so with impunity under the First Amendment's\nguarantee of freedom of expression.57 The Court went on to emphasize\nthat the ability to exercise one's First Amendment freedoms, even within\n49 Video: Family Research Council Supports the Stop SB 48 Referendum, supra note 28.\n50 Kosciw, supra note 4, at 16.\n51 Id. at xvii.\n52 Id. at 17.\n53 See BIEGEL, supra note 12, at 3-4.\n54 Id. at 4.\n55 Tinker v.

In the plurality opinion of Board of Education of\nIsland Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico,60 the Court in-\nvalidated a school's discretionary removal of controversial books from\nthe school library using Tinker's assertion that students do not shed their\nFirst Amendment rights while in school. 61 In Bethel School District No.\n403 v. Fraser,62 the Court found that the punishment of a student, who\nused sexist, offensive, and degrading language in reference to his peer, at\na mandatory school assembly, did not run afoul of the Constitution. 63\nThe Court argued that the First Amendment does not protect the use of\nlewd, obscene, and sexually \"vulgar\" language, and that the rights pos-\nsessed by students in public schools are not \"automatically coextensive\nwith the rights of adults in other settings.\"6^\nSeveral years later, in Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier,65 the Court found\nthat a school principal was justified in censoring a story about teen preg-\nnancy and divorce in a school newspaper, and did not violate the First\nAmendment. 66 The Court distinguished this case from Tinker by arguing\nthat Hazelwood involved the ability of schools to control curricular deci-\nsions. 6 7 Justice White pointed out that,\n[T]he question that we addressed in Tinker-is different\nfrom the question whether the First Amendment requires\na school affirmatively to promote [a] particular student\nspeech. The former question addresses the educators'\nability to silence a student's personal expression that\nhappens to occur on the school premises.

Frederick,6 9 the Supreme Court found\nthat the protections afforded to student speech established in Tinker do\nnot apply to speech that promotes illegal drug use. 70 Although there has\nbeen discussion about whether this case weakens the First Amendment\nprotections established in Tinker, two of the five justices joined this opin-\nion on the understanding that:\n(1) it goes no further than to hold that a public school\nmay restrict speech that a reasonable observer would in-\nterpret as advocating illegal drug use and (2) it provides\nno support for any restriction of speech that can plausi-\nbly be interpreted as commenting on any political or so-\ncial issue . 7. . .1\nAs a result of this caveat, the holding is clearly limited.\nTaken together, these cases demonstrate that Tinker is still good\nlaw, but with some notable restrictions. Though the Court in Bethel up-\nheld the decision of school administrators to punish a student for offen-\nsive speech, it appears they did so because the speech was sexist,\nobjectively crude, and threatening towards a female student. Although in\nHazelwood, the Court found a principal's censoring of the school's\nnewspaper articles to be constitutionally tolerable, this case can be distin-\nguished from the issue of whether LGBTQ students have a right to ex-\npress their identities, even if school administrators are morally or\npolitically opposed to them. The Court emphasized the legitimacy of the\nschool's fear that the opinion pieces may be confused inadvertently with\nan official statement from the school, because the paper bore its name.\nWhen students express their personal identity openly, it would be unrea-\nsonable and nonsensical for one to confuse that expression with an offi-\ncial statement by the school, since it is an individual identification.\nFinally, in the Morse plurality opinion, the Court explicitly sought to\nlimit the restriction on Tinker to speech involving illegal activities, such\nas drug use.\nAdditionally, although Rust v.

The rights asserted in\nboth cases, and the dignity at stake for each of the parties, are discernibly\ndifferent. In prohibiting doctors from discussing abortions with their pa-\ntients, the government clearly intended to limit the practice of abortions\nand stigmatize the procedure itself. When schools refuse to discuss sexu-\nality and gender identity, however, although they do stigmatize lesbian\nand gay sexual practices, they also demean an entire class of people and\nrelegate them to a form of second-class citizenship by implying they are\nnot deserving of mention, or worse, that they should be explicitly\ncondemned.\nFor example, although it can be a very impactful procedure, women\ngenerally do not define themselves by the abortions they receive. Al-\nthough women who have abortions may feel guilt if such procedures are\nstigmatized, they are not treated as second-class citizens in their every-\nday life, and the stigmatization of the procedure is not akin to the stigma-\ntization of an entire class of persons based on what is widely viewed as a\nfundamental characteristic to one's identity. By contrast, when LGBTQ\nyouth are denied the opportunity to be open about their lives, they, and\nthe LGBTQ communities of which they are a part, are stigmatized in a\nvery basic but systemic way that impacts their ability to navigate every-\nday life.\n73 Id. at 193.\n74 See id. at 178.\n75 Id. at 181.\n76 Id. at 196-98.\n77 Id. at 193.\nWHEN SCHOOLS REFUSE TO \"SAY GAY\"\nB. Tensions Between Parental Disapproval of School Curricula and\nStudents' Rights\nAlthough families have a strong right to control the upbringing of\ntheir children, public schools have an arguably broader and stronger right\nto create informative curricula and give children appropriate and impor-\ntant information that may curb violence or hate. Parents who challenge\ncurriculum-based decisions in court are rarely successful due to the sig-\nnificant deference courts typically give to school boards and districts in\ncreating curricula. This deference is at least partially because these deci-\nsions are often made by democratically elected officials, and parents\nhave the ability to vote those officials in or out of office if they so\nchoose.78 As the Supreme Court reaffirmed in Tinker:\nBoards of Education . . . have, of course, important, deli-\ncate, and highly discretionary functions, but none that\nthey may not perform within the limits of the Bill of\nRights. That they are educating the young for citizen-\nship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional\nfreedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the\nfree mind at its source and teach youth to discount im-\nportant principles of our government as mere\nplatitudes.79\nA case that typifies this line of decisions is Mozert v. Hawkins.s0 In\n1987, seven Tennessee families challenged school curriculum they found\nobjectionable to their religious and moral beliefs. The families did not\nbelong to a specific church, though they identified as born-again Chris-\ntians who outlined a long list of objections to certain curricula, ranging\nfrom \"such familiar concerns of fundamentalist Christians as evolution\nand 'secular humanism' to less familiar themes such as 'futuristic super-\nnaturalism,' pacifism, magic[,] and false views of death.\" 8' The Court's\nopinion, which has been taken as a national decision on this subject,\nruled against the families in question. 82 The court made an important\n78 BuGEL, supra note 12, at 81 (\"Although there is a concurrent right of families not to\nreceive information and ideas, buttressed by the long-standing right of parents to direct the\nupbringing of their children, the right to receive information is much stronger and much less\nlimited in its scope. Parents who challenge curriculum-related decisions in a court of law are\nrarely successful, with courts implicitly relying on the principle that members of the commu-\nnity have delegated the responsibility of developing curricular requirements and identifying\nappropriate instructional materials to duly elected officials at the state and local levels. Should\nfamilies become unhappy with these decisions, they are seen as able to replace the officials\nwith new representatives who can then change the status quo.\").\n79 W.Va. Bd. of Educ. v.

The\ncourt pointed out that,\nthe plaintiffs appeared to assume that materials clearly\npresented as poetry, fiction and even \"make-believe\" in\nthe Holt series were presented as facts which the stu-\ndents were required to believe. Nothing in the record\nsupports this assumption.83\nThe Court went on to emphasize the importance of religious and civic\ntolerance:\n[Tiolerance of divergent. . . religious views referred to\nby the Supreme Court is a civil tolerance, not a religious\none. It does not require a person to accept any other\nreligion as the equal of the one to which that person ad-\nheres. It merely requires a recognition that in a pluralis-\ntic society we must 'live and let live.' 8 4\nMost importantly, the Court concluded that there was no evidence that\nstudents were forced to participate in any way beyond reading and dis-\ncussing the materials-they were not disciplined for disagreeing with the\nlessons or reprimanded for posing opposing viewpoints.85\nThere are also a series of cases that firmly establish the right of\nGay-Straight Alliance groups to exist on public school campuses, even\nwhere there is some disapproval by teachers or parents. One such case is\nDowns v. LAUSD 86, where a school teacher, who opposed the school's\nrecognition of June as gay pride month, put up posters opposing same-\nsex relationships across from gay pride displays on campus.87 The court\nfound that as a government actor, the teacher could not engage in speech\non school grounds that ran contrary to the District's memorandum setting\nup the parameters of the event, which was meant to educate and inform\nstudents about LGBT history. The court notes that,\nAn arm of local government such as a school board may\ndecide not only to talk about gay and lesbian awareness\nand tolerance in general, but also to advocate such toler-\nance if it so decides, and restrict the contrary speech of\none of its representatives.8 8\n83 Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1063-64.\n84 Id. at 1069.\n85 Id. at 1063- 1064\n86 Downs v.

Board of Education, a group of\nconservative families challenged the constitutionality of a mandatory\ntraining program that addressed the issue of LGBTQ harassment and bul-\nlying in school.90 The school district was required to put on this training\nin response to a lawsuit filed against them due to incidents of harassment\nand abuse directed towards LGBTQ youth in the district.91 The district\nmade the programs age-appropriate, and also had separate trainings for\nstaff and students.92 Despite these efforts, the families still claimed that\ntheir children were being \"indoctrinated\" without receiving a counter-\nmessage that they viewed as morally appropriate, which was that\nLGBTQ identities are wrong.9 3\nThe court found that despite the families' claims, it was well within\nthe district's legal jurisdiction to develop programming that addresses\nLGBTQ issues in both middle and high school, even without securing\nparental permission. 94 They went on to say that by addressing the issue\nin a dispassionate and objective manner, even though anti-LGBT narra-\ntives were excluded, the district did not violate and rights of the families.\nIt was also clear to the court that no form of \"indoctrination\" took place,\nand that the right of the district to develop such programming out-\nweighed the objections of parents involving mere exposure to LGBTQ\nlives and histories.95\nC. \"Coming Out\" as Disruptive Speech?\nAnti-LGBTQ advocates often argue that limitations on speech cre-\nated by no-promo-homo policies are actually for the LGBTQ students'\n(and their peers') own good, because \"coming out\" is inherently disrup-\ntive process that violates the tenets of Tinker. Several lower court cases\nhave, using both First and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, concluded\nthat a student's right to be \"out\" outweighs a school's interest in using\nsilence or forced conformity as a means of \"protecting\" them from other\nstudents.\n89 See id. at 1016.\n90 See Morrison v.

Lynch,96 perhaps the first case to apply Tinker in an\nLGBTQ-specific context, a federal court in Rhode Island rejected a\nschool principal's claim that two boys could not attend prom together\nbecause their peers' reaction could \"lead to disruption . . . and possibly to\nphysical harm.\" 97 The court found that even though the principal had a\ngenuine concern for the student's safety, prohibiting these students from\nattending prom would give those who might attack or harass them a\n\"heckler's veto\" by allowing the harassers \". . . to decide-through pro-\nhibited and violent methods-what speech will be heard.\"9 8\nSince Fricke, a number of First Amendment cases in lower courts\nhave established the right of students to form Gay-Straight Alliance\n(\"GSA\") clubs on public school campuses. 99 These lawsuits have been\nalmost universally successful in establishing that students have a right to\nform these clubs, despite the potential controversy that might result. In\none such case, a federal court in Kentucky used both Fricke and Tinker\nto establish that a disruptive response (i.e. a student harassing another\nstudent) was not a relevant Tinker consideration because such a limita-\ntion, again, would give those opposing certain speech a type of veto\npower. Instead, the court stated that \"only upon a showing that Plain-\ntiffs' own disruptive activities have interfered with Defendants' ability to\nmaintain order and discipline\"\"oo should the Tinker rule apply. In a simi-\nlar case, one federal court even concluded that the GSA clubs actually\nhelp avoid educational disruptions that occur when students are harassed\nas a result of their sexual orientation because the clubs help create a more\ntolerant school environment-a finding that is confirmed by relevant\ndata. 101\nD.

This stigmatization locked an entire segment of the population into a\nsubordinate status and often forced such individuals either to transform or to suppress impor-\ntant dimensions of their identities in order to escape second-class treatment in the public\nrealm.\").\n106 Romer, 517 U.S. at 632-33.\n107 Id.\n108 Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 560.\nI09 Id. at 575.\n1 10 Id.\n2012] 483\n484 CORNELL JOURNAL OF LAW AND PULIC POLICY [Vol. 22:465\nO'Connor's concurrence emphasized the importance of respecting the\ndignity of lesbian and gay people by respecting their private choices and\nlives.\"' In Romer, the court emphasized that \"if the constitutional con-\nception of 'equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the\nvery least mean that a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular\ngroup cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\"' 12\nAs Professor Michael C.

REv. 1267, 1269 (2011)\n1]3 Id. at 1275 (2011) (\"Although this Article ultimately concludes that laws withholding\nthe term marriage from same-sex couples unconstitutionally convey the message of second-\nclass citizenship, that concrete doctrinal point merely illustrates a broader argument. This\nArticle aims chiefly to shed light on the general problem of the social meaning(s) of govern-\nment acts, statements, and symbols. It considers both positive and normative questions. The\nmethodology could be best characterized as \"interpretive\" in the Dworkinian sense. It articu-\nlates and unpacks the thesis that the Constitution forbids government acts, statements, and\nsymbols that label some persons or relationships as second-class-with a special focus on\nthose government actions, like the denial of the term marriage to some but not all couples, that\nhave \"only\" a symbolic impact.\").\nWHEN SCHOOLS REFUSE TO \"SAY GAY\"\nfederal benefits), it is clear that the label \"civil union\" is meant to convey\na form of inferiority as compared. to the label \"marriage,\" thus its use\nshould be constitutionally suspect.\" 14\nAlthough some advocates may argue that this is not the social\nmeaning such distinctions are meant to convey, Dorf argues that it would\nbe most useful to have a constitutional standard that asks what a reasona-\nble victim would perceive the social meaning of a law to be. If that\nidentifiable victim group perceives a law to be a degrading and inten-\ntional way to promote their \"inferiority,\" it should be subject to height-\nened scrutiny.\"l5 In the case of same-sex marriage, same-sex couples\nwould clearly view this linguistic distinction as a way to mark them as\ninferior or undesirably different, because of the social meaning and moti-\nvation behind the distinction. In fact, much of the language used by anti-\nsame-sex marriage advocates admits that marriage is superior-and that\nit must be \"preserved\" and \"protected.\"I 16\nAlthough Professor Dorf discusses this test and this idea in the con-\ntext of same-sex marriage, it is also helpful in analyzing the social mean-\ning behind no-promo-homo policies and crafting an appropriate\nconstitutional test. It is clear, both in the explicit language of the policies\nand the implicit disapproval they are founded upon, that the laws them-\nselves aim to relegate LGBTQ people and their relationships to an infer-\nior status. Even if reasonable minds could differ, however, it seems clear\nthat LGBTQ youth and LGBTQ people, who are victims of these laws,\nwould view them as based solely on animus and as an intentional state-\nment about their perceived inferiority. Because students have a right to\nbe out in school, no-promo-homo policies cannot be sincerely portrayed\nas anything other than based upon animus and disapproval of LGBTQ\npeople and their identities. As a result, they are constitutionally imper-\nmissible, should be subject to heightened scrutiny, and systematically\noverturned.\n114 Id. at 1267, 1315.\n115 Id. at 1332, 1337.\n116 PROTECTMARRIAGE.COM, http://protectmarriage.com/about (last visited March 24,\n2012) (\"ProtectManiage.com is a broad-based coalition of California families, community\nleaders, religious leaders, pro-family organizations and individuals from all walks of life who\nhave joined together to defend and restore the definition of marriage as between a man and a\nwoman.

POLICY INITIATIVES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS\nA. Possibilities for Change\nThere are many opportunities for change through legal and policy-\nbased initiatives. Despite the number of states that have no-promo-homo\nlaws on the books, there are many more that do not have such laws, and\nare limited legally only by federal law and the Constitution. As this note\ndiscussed in the previous section, courts tend to defer curricular decision-\nmaking to school districts. Accordingly, there is ample room for creativ-\nity at the local, state, and federal level to create change.' 17\nB. Changes in Federal Policy: Punitive Measures\nInvalidating no-promo-homo policies is only one step of many in\nthe effort to protect LGBTQ youth from bullying and suicidality. While\ninvalidating these laws will make a positive difference, the social mes-\nsage of inferiority and stigma that motivates anti-LGBTQ advocates to\npush for such laws will exist even if the policies are overturned.\nIn recent years, activists and governmental agencies have developed\nboth punitive and preventative policy initiatives in order to address\nLGBTQ bullying. Punitive measures have included statewide anti-bully-\ning statutes,1 t LGBTQ inclusive federal hate crimes legislation, 119 and a\nnumber of recent federal policy changes which allow the Department of\nEducation and the Department of Justice, for the first time in history, to\nbroaden their jurisdiction to pursue claims of bullying and harassment\ndirected towards LGBTQ youth.120 Although these changes are very sig-\nnificant, the discretion given to federal agencies means that any un-codi-\nfied changes are vulnerable to elimination if an unfriendly administration\ncomes into power.\nAs a result, activists have been pushing for a federal statute that\nwould solidify these protections, using the measures available in federal\n117 See BIFiL, supra note 12, at 81.\n118 Fourteen states prohibit bullying based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Criticisms of Punitive Remedies\nThere has been significant criticism of measures that punish young\nbullies with prison sentences or other criminal fines. The most vocal of\nthese criticisms come from activists who favor some form of prison abo-\nlition or mass-reformation, as a result of the racial and socio-economic\ndisparities and discrimination that exist within the criminal legal sys-\ntem.122 They argue against putting any young people in jail due to the\ndisproportionate impact such laws have on poor people, particularly poor\npeople of color. They also tend to assert that prisons are violent and\nproblematic spaces for members of the LGBTQ community, particularly\ntransgender people, therefore it is problematic to expose even non-\nLGBTQ youth, to these institutions in the name of LGBTQ equality and\njustice. 123 It is also not clear whether punishment is the most effective\nway to remedy the root causes of bullying and violence: heterosexism\nand trans-phobia.12 4\nFederal punitive laws, like the recently passed Hate Crimes Act, 125\nprovide federal authorities with the ability to intervene in the criminal\nprocess where homophobic and transphobic local authorities will not.\nUltimately, however, prison sentences for perpetrators of hate and igno-\nrance-motivated violence will not remedy oppression and hate, and can-\nnot be the sole or even a primary solution for LGBTQ bullying and\nsuicide.\n121 See Jason A. Wallace, Bullycide in American Schools: Forging a Comprehensive Leg-\nislative Solution, 86 Ind. L.J. 735 (2011) (\"It seems possible that the more 'cosmopolitan'\ngathering of national legislators would be likely to pass a federal LGBT-inclusive anti-bullying\nbill, even if their insular counterparts at the state level would not necessarily enact such a\npolicy. Ultimately, senators and representatives would be wise to view a comprehensive anti-\nbullying bill as protecting children of all races, genders, religions, and sexual orientation, but\nmost importantly as a bill protecting all children.\")\n122 See Dean Spade and Craig Willse Confronting the Limits of Gay Hate Crimes Activ-\nism: A Radical Critique, 21 CHICANo-LATINo L.

The California FAIR Education Act: A Preventative Step\nIn a study of five hundred young adults by the American Psycholog-\nical Association, four distinct motivations for anti-LGBTQ aggression\nwere identified: perceived self-defense, enforcement of gender norms,\npeer dynamics, and thrill seeking.1 26 The study concluded that anti-\nLGBT violence \"can be seen primarily as an extreme manifestation of\npervasive cultural norms rather than as a manifestation of individual ha-\ntred\" and that those \"who have assaulted homosexuals typically do not\nrecognize themselves in the stereotyped image of the hate-filled extrem-\nist.\"127 A more recent study done in 2007 indicates that young men in\nparticular-the group most likely to commit anti-LGBTQ violence-feel\nstrongly that they must constantly \"prove\" they are not gay.128\nEfforts to address anti-LGBTQ violence must aim to change and\nchallenge these cultural norms, which are directly responsible for anti-\nLGBTQ violence and the codifications of anti-LGBTQ laws. To this\nend, in July 2011, California became the first state in the nation to pass\nan educational policy that requires public schools to adopt textbooks that\nare inclusive of, and affirm, the contributions of LGBTQ people and\nother marginalized groups.129 In relevant part, the FAIR Education Act\nmade substantial amendments to the California Education Code, requir-\ning schools to adopt textbooks that include the histories of LGBT people\nas well as the histories of various racial and ethnic minorities.130 The\nAct also ensures that state and local school boards and districts may not\ninclude any material in their curricula that portrays the lives and histories\nof LGBTQ people or racial minorities in an objectively negative light.' 3 1\n126 lEGEL, supra note 12, at xviii (citing Karen Franklin, PSYCHOSOCIAL MOTIVATIONS\nor HAni CRIME PERPEITRNroRS: IMPLICATIONS FOR PREVENTION AND PoLicy 5-6 (1998)).\n127 Id.\n128 See C.J.
