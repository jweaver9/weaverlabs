A thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Psychology At Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand  Darya Fedchuk 2017     ii   Abstract Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a maladaptive behaviour, defined as the purposeful destruction of one’s own body tissue performed in absence of suicidal intent or social custom. Research suggests that NSSI is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Research also suggests that LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) identifying individuals are at a higher risk for experiencing mental distress, NSSI and suicidality. Within Aotearoa/New Zealand, the Youth’12: Health and Wellbeing of Secondary School Students survey found that LGBTQ adolescents had significantly higher rates of NSSI and were five times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual and/or cisgender counterparts. This thesis addresses these concerns through a qualitative approach, guided by the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. This research examines how LGBTQ individuals who have previously engaged in NSSI make sense of their experience. The six individuals interviewed share their background histories, the process of coming out, and their experiences with NSSI. Participants further comment on the various ways in which existing ideologies within their social climates impacted their overall health and wellbeing.  There were numerous challenges faced by the participants. Some experienced discriminatory behaviours from family, friends, and health professionals. The process of coming out as LGBTQ was a difficult time for many. Participants experienced stigma and discrimination in association with both their identity, and the self-injurious behaviour. NSSI was seen largely as a coping mechanism, and participants displayed resilience in light of their circumstances.  Self-esteem and self-acceptance increased as participants acquired a stronger sense of belonging through meaningful connections. Building supportive friendships, and finding a   iii  community contributed to positive health outcomes. However, despite a solidified identity, societal pressures remained.  The results of this thesis suggest that education and tailored support from health professionals is of utmost importance. The ongoing challenges experienced by the participants are reflected in research, and signify that educating families, health professionals, and the wider society is a crucial step in assisting this at-risk group. Implications for future directions are discussed.      iv  Acknowledgements  They say it takes a village to raise a child, and in a lot of ways the sentiment rings true about this thesis. The work started as a passion project, and I did not anticipate the effect this fulfilling, albeit arduous, journey would have on me. Although I am the author who birthed and nurtured this work, it would not have survived without the following people:  My participants, without whom I would have no thesis. Thank you for allowing me into your world, sharing your most private experiences and speaking with such sincerity. To my fellow psychology friends Tamyra, Irie, Gloria, and Jasmine. Thank you for letting me vent, injecting humour into my life, and inspiring me with your ideas. Thank you to Boris, Tracey and Deanna who have brought me back from despair by providing sustenance to continue my journey. Dean, your cooking has kept me going.  My consultants: Kassie, Jean, and Gwyn, thank you for your feedback and your time. To my supervisor John, thank you for your guidance and endless patience. Thank you to the late Harry, and Bella for endless hours of entertainment and providing your soft feline fur on which to rest my weary head after long days. And finally, my partner Hannah, without whom this project would not have seen the end of its completion. Your support and unconditional love has been paramount to me getting up each morning and continuing this thesis. You are my anchor in turbulent times and my most illustrious companion. I have no words to describe my gratitude. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  This thesis is dedicated to my communities; the shoulders of giants on which I stand, the lives lost, and the hope that our pain will be superseded by benevolent tenderness.    v  Table of Contents Abstract .......................................................................................................................... ii Acknowledgements ....................................................................................................... iv Table of Contents ........................................................................................................... v List of Tables ................................................................................................................ ix List of Figures ............................................................................................................... ix Introduction .................................................................................................................... 1 Defining LGBTQ in this thesis .................................................................................. 1 Chapter 1: Literature review .......................................................................................... 5 Overview .................................................................................................................... 5 1.
