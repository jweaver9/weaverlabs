On average, less than one half of one percent of foundation funding for health is for LGBTQ communities. $8,645,407$23,200,000$4,113,557$3,570,900$4,467,421$3,382,775$1,959,965HEALTH ISSUES FUNDEDNearly half of LGBTQ health funding was for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment,with significant portions also devoted to primary care, mental health and substance abuse, cancer, and insurance coverage.Build Capacity of the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ Health Services Sector.Of U.S. funding for HIV/AIDS, only 21% targets LGBTQ communities - although LGBTQ people account for the majority of new infections.4    Vital  Funding INTRODUCTIONThe movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) rights has seen amazing progress in recent years, on issues ranging from the freedom to marry to inclusion in the military. Yet even with these advances in legal equality, many LGBTQ people still face basic challenges when it comes to quality of life. LGBTQ people are at greater risk for mental and behavioral health challenges, and for diseases such as HIV/AIDS and cancer. Many of us lack health insurance and face other barriers to accessing health care—especially among those who are transgender, people of color, undocumented or economically disadvantaged. In short, we are more likely to get sick, and we are less likely to get the care we need.This report, Vital Funding: Investing in LGBTQ Health and Wellbeing, assesses the scale and character of foundation funding for the health and well-being of LGBTQ communities. Drawing on the data collected for our annual tracking reports on LGBTQ funding, we find that domestic foundation funding for LGBTQ health totaled $50.4 million for 2011 - 2013. Considering the magnitude of the health disparities facing LGBTQ communities, this is a fairly modest amount – and it is highly dependent on a small set of dedicated funders.When it comes to LGBTQ health, we face daunting challenges, but we also have impressive assets to build on. As a community and as a movement, we have time and again demonstrated our ability to come together to support one another, to advocate for ourselves, and to build lasting institutions. Across the country, there are hundreds of LGBTQ community centers, health centers, and HIV/AIDS service agencies, and other community groups advancing LGBTQ health. There are also a growing number of non-LGBTQ-focused institutions—from hospitals to research centers—seeking to improve their competence, expertise, and effectiveness in working with LGBTQ communities. In the philanthropic sector, LGBTQ health offers a unique opportunity for LGBTQ funders, HIV funders, and health funders to come together, to learn from each other, and to leverage grant dollars in creative ways. We are honored to have the support of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for this effort, and to have wonderful allies in organizations such as Funders Concerned About AIDS and Grantmakers In Health. We hope this report will provide a starting point for a broad and diverse group of funders to develop strategies for lasting and powerful impact on the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ communities.Take care, Ben Francisco Maulbeck President2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013200525M15M3MTable of ContentsTHE NEED 6OVERVIEW OF LGBTQ HEALTH FUNDING 10WHO IS FUNDING LGBTQ HEALTH? 12WHAT IS BEING FUNDED IN LGBTQ HEALTH? 15FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES 232004 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013200525M15M3MLGBTQ Health Funding2004-2013* Includes both domestic and international health funding.6    Vital  Funding The NeedVital  Funding    7HEALTH DISPARITIESLike other minority groups, the LGBTQ community faces significant health disparities, particularly  around issues of HIV, cancer, cardiovascular health, and mental health. These disparities tend to be especially severe among various LGBTQ subpopulations such as people of color, youth, older adults, and transgender people. HIVDespite decreasing HIV incidence rates in the general U.S. population, rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women have continued to rise. In 2010, there was an estimated 12-percent increase in new infections among men who have sex with men, who accounted for more than three-quarters of new infections among men and nearly two-thirds of all new infections. There is an especially high prevalence among youth between 13-24 years of age, Black men, and Latino men.1 Young Black gay and bisexual men showed the greatest increase of new cases from 2008-2011.2 Among transgender women, the incidence is more difficult to estimate because gender identity is not tracked by most data collection sources. Still, we know that transgender people, and African American trans women in particular, face severe risks of HIV. Based upon a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 studies focusing on trans health, 28 percent of trans women tested positive for HIV. When adjusted for population size, trans women are nearly twice as likely as gay and bisexual men to contract HIV.3 Gay men and trans people not only face these higher rates of infection, but are also more likely to face obstacles to diagnosis and treatment.CancerDue to higher rates of obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and delayed engagement in preventative healthcare, LGBTQ people are at increased risk for developing various types of cancer. LGBTQ people are at higher risk for both colon cancer and lung cancer. Lesbians and bisexual women are at increased risk for breast cancer and gynecological cancers. Gay and bisexual men face increased risk for both prostate cancer and anal cancer. One major contributor to increased risk for gynecological cancers, anal cancer, and, in some cases, oral cancers is HPV. Many members of the LGBTQ community perceive low risk regarding HPV and are less inclined to have Pap smears or anal Pap tests, which is critical to detecting potential symptoms of HPV, gynecological cancers, and anal cancer.4 It is hard to assess the specific numbers of cancer-related cases in the LGBTQ community, given that no large national data has been collected on sexual orientation or gender identity among the major cancer-related entities; improved data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity around cancer would enable development of more targeted strategies for prevention and early treatment of cancers in LGBTQ communities.Substance AbuseDisparities around HIV, cancer and other health conditions can be attributed in part to behavioral risk factors such as substance use and addiction, particularly tobacco and alcohol use. LGBTQ people are 2-3 times more likely to be addicted to tobacco compared to general population. It is estimated that over 30,000 LGBTQ people die annually because of tobacco-related causes. A recent adolescent health survey found that same-sex attracted individuals were more likely to smoke (45 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys) compared to other youth (29 percent).5 Additionally, it is estimated that approximately 30 percent of gays and lesbians have substance abuse problems related to alcohol. LGBTQ youth are almost 200 percent more likely to use substances compared to heterosexual youth.6 This contributes to various types of cancer, cardiovascular health concerns, and sexual health risks resulting from behavioral choices made while under the influence.8    Vital  Funding Percentage of Youth Who Smoke, by Sexual Orientation29%35%45%Lesbian/Bisexual GirlsGay/Bisexual BoysStraight YouthMental HealthIn part, higher rates of substance abuse among LGBTQ people are tied to coping strategies in the face of discrimination and stigma, as well as historical socialization processes and community-building opportunities that most often occurred in bars and clubs. LGBTQ individuals are more likely to report feelings of depression and anxiety. In fact, it is estimated that close to 720,000 LGBTQ community members suffer from serious mental illness.7 LGBTQ people have higher rates of suicide and attempts, especially among transgender people—41 percent of whom report attempting suicide at some point in their lives, compared to 1.6 percent of the general population.8 These mental health challenges are even more prevalent among youth and elders. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTHSocial determinants are environmental factors—whether place-based or sociocultural—that contribute to health outcomes. Many of the health disparities faced by LGBTQ communities are due to inequities related to social determinants. The LGBTQ community has been subjected to a long history of legal inequality, social marginalization, and other forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These systems of discrimination have resulted in inequities around housing access, employment and socioeconomic status, and other stresses, which in turn contribute to poor health.HomelessnessIt is estimated that LGBTQ youth make up to 40 percent of the homeless youth population.9 Within this population of LGBTQ homeless youth, nearly two-thirds are people of color.10  Many more LGBTQ youth are also in the fostercare and the juvenile justice system. The high rate of homelessness among LGBTQ youth is in part attributable to lack of family acceptance and fears of repercussions for coming out. Family RejectionNot only can family rejection directly lead to problems such as homelessness, it also has long-term health consequences. Researchers have found that LGBTQ people who are rejected by their families in adolescence are more likely to experience depression, low self-esteem, substance abuse, and other health problems in adulthood. LGBTQ people who feel rejected by their families in their youth are more than twice as likely to have suicidal ideations in their adulthood.11Poverty and UnemploymentLGBTQ people are more likely to live in poverty compared to the general population. Thirty-two percent of LGBTQ individuals have household incomes of less than $24,000, compared to 24 percent of non-LGBTQ people with incomes of less than $24,000.12 Transgender people, youth, women, and African Americans face particularly severe income disparities.12 A large segment of the LGBTQ community is also underemployed or unemployed. Transgender individuals are the most impacted, as they are often discriminated against by employers or potential Vital  Funding    9employers and lack explicit legal protections in most jurisdictions. In fact, 44 percent of transgender individuals are underemployed, and they are twice as likely to be unemployed.13 LGBTQ individuals also have higher living costs because they are often ineligible for various incentives and tax breaks afforded to heterosexual married couples. Additionally, gay families on average have the lowest annual incomes and often do not qualify for some federal assistance programs like WIC.14Violence and BullyingBased on reports from LGBTQ-focused anti-violence programs, more than 2,000 LGBTQ people were the victims of hate-motivated violence in 2013. Only 45 percent of these survivors of violence reported the incident to the police; of those who did report, nearly one-third reported hostility, being unjustly arrested, being subjected to excessive force, or other forms of police misconduct.13 LGBTQ people also experience high levels of intimate-partner violence. Forty-four percent of lesbians and 61 percent of bisexual women have experienced intimate-partner violence, compared to 35 percent of heterosexual women.14 LGBTQ youth are also more likely to face violence and other forms of bullying. Eighteen and a half percent of gay and lesbian high school students and 15.5 percent of bisexual students reporting threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, compared to 6.1 percent of heterosexual students.15 These experiences of bullying, hate violence, and intimate partner violence are likely to contribute to depression and other mental health challenges, difficulties accessing care, and to other social determinants such as economic security.Delayed CareLGBTQ individuals are less likely to engage in preventive health and treatment services. Delayed engagement in health care is a leading cause for many of the poor health outcomes plaguing the LGBTQ community. LGBTQ individuals report feeling their healthcare providers are less culturally responsive and understanding of their needs. This causes some to avoid healthcare engagement or for those engaging in care to not disclose their sexual and/or gender identity for fear of discrimination. HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE Lack of health insurance is another major factor contributing to poor health outcomes for LGBTQ people. Nearly 18 percent of LGBTQ adults have no health insurance compared to about 13 percent of non-LGBTQ adults.16  Legal inequality contributes to this gap; in states that do not recognize marriage equality or same-sex partnerships, LGB people are unable to attain health insurance through a same-sex spouse’s employer. Advancements in marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have helped increase the number of LGBTQ people with health insurance. Among LGBTQ people living below 400 percent of federal poverty guidelines, the ACA has decreased the uninsured population from 34 percent to 26 percent.17 Despite this progress, LGBTQ people face discrimination and unique barriers to accessing health insurance coverage in many jurisdictions. Transgender people face particularly severe barriers when it comes to insurance; more than one-third have no health insurance, even after the first year of the ACA’s full implementation. Even among those who do have health insurance, they are often denied coverage by health plans that exclude necessary medical care for transgender people.18Percentage of Uninsured Adults, by Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity18%13%LGBTQ AdultsNon-LGBTQ Adults10    Vital  Funding Overview of LGBTQ Health FundingVital  Funding    11U.S. FOUNDATION FUNDING FOR LGBTQ HEALTH ISSUES In 2011-2013, foundations awarded 1,757 grants totaling $50.4 million for LGBTQ health in the U.S. Nearly half (46 percent) of these grant dollars were for HIV/AIDS, and the remaining 54 percent addressed health issues ranging from breast cancer to mental health and suicide prevention.Health captured about 17 percent of the total $301 million in domestic LGBTQ funding for 2011-2013. This makes health the second most-funded LGBTQ issue—though it is a distant second, capturing a much smaller portion than the 41 percent for civil rights.Civil rights41%Health17%Violence, Homophobia,& Transphobia 4%Economic issues 4%Other issues 10%Education 8%Building Communities,Families, & Visibility17%2011-2013LGBT Grant Dollarsby Issue In the context of overall foundation funding for health, only a tiny fraction specifically targets LGBTQ communities. In 2011, foundations awarded $3 billion in grants for health in the U.S.19  Domestic LGBTQ health funding that year was approximately $16 million, or about one half of one percent of the total. Even in the context of HIV/AIDS, only about 21 percent of HIV/AIDS funding targets gay, bisexual, and transgender communities, even though LGBTQ people account for the majority of new infections in the U.S.2012    Vital  Funding Who is fundingLGBTQ health?Vital  Funding    13SOURCES OF LGBTQ HEALTH FUNDING As with LGBTQ funding overall, the majority of domestic LGBTQ health funding (51 percent) is provided by private foundations. The second largest share of LGBTQ health funding (24 percent) comes from various public funders—including public LGBTQ foundations as well as public HIV/AIDS foundations, such as the Elton John AIDS Foundation.Notably, a larger share of LGBTQ health funding comes from corporate funders, which provide 13 percent of domestic LGBTQ health funding but only 6 percent of LGBTQ funding overall. This trend is largely driven by several corporate funders that are among the top HIV/AIDS funders, such as Levi-Strauss & Co., the M.A.C. AIDS Fund, and Wells Fargo.   Community foundations also provide a larger share of LGBTQ health funding (9 percent) than they do for LGBTQ funding overall (4 percent). This is largely because a number of community foundations have invested in health services for LGBTQ communities in their local area, both for HIV/AIDS and for health needs more broadly.Sources of LGBTQ Health Funding by Type of Funder2011-201313% Other Funders4% Community Foundations6% Corporate Funders22% Public Funders54% Private Foundations3% Other Funders9% Community Foundations13% Corporate Funders24% Public Funders51% Private FoundationsAllLGBTQFundingDomestic LGBTQ Health FundingDomestic LGBTQ Health Funding All LGBTQ FundingPrivate Foundations $25,730,262 $220,873,346Public Funders $12,276,686 $90,066,522Corporate Funders $6,545,284 $25,757,222Community Foundations $4,504,809 $17,308,575Other Funders $1,740,000 $53,422,810Grand Total $50,797,041 $407,428,475 *This chart includes funds intended for regranting.14    Vital  Funding The top 25 funders awarded a total of $35.6 million in grants for LGBTQ health, accounting for about 70 percent of all LGBTQ health funding in 2011-2013.

Komen Foundation. ) More than $3.3 million were devoted to activities related to insurance coverage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, largely for outreach to enroll LGBTQ people in new insurance coverage options and for advocacy for LGBTQ-inclusive policies in the establishment of state health care exchanges. ) More than $3.5 million were devoted to primary care, largely for general support of LGBTQ health clinics and other primary care providers specifically targeting LGBTQ communities. ) Cultural competence and data collection received almost $2 million for data collection on LGBTQ health care needs and training of health care providers on effectively serving LGBTQ communities.  ) Smaller amounts were devoted to sexual and reproductive health ($682,981), child welfare/foster care ($465,073), smoking cessation ($191,271), and food and nutrition ($108,520). The above breakdown, however, may underestimate the level of support for certain health issues. In particular, a significant portion of HIV/AIDS grant dollars by their nature also address other health issues affecting LGBTQ communities. For example, HIV/AIDS prevention activities often address issues of mental health, addiction, and sexual and reproductive health. Similarly, many primary care providers and health service providers also offer HIV/AIDS treatment. The wide range of issues addressed are reflected in the list of top 25 LGBTQ health grantees for 2011-2013, which include organizations addressing issues such as HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, health care reform, primary care, aging, suicide prevention, and breast cancer.LGBTQ Health Funding by Specific Health Issue Fundedexcluding HIV/AIDS, 2011-2013General Health Services &Health Promotion $8,645,407Mental health, substance abuse,& suicide prevention $4,467,421Cancer $4,113,557Primary care $3,570,900 Insurance Coverage &ACA implementation $3,382,775Cultural competance &data collection $1,959,965Vital  Funding    17Top 25 LGBTQ Health Grantees, 2011 - 20131.

Illinois Caucus for Adolescent Health, Chicago, IL $402,00018    Vital  Funding TARGET POPULATIONSLGBTQ health funding is exceptionally likely to target specific populations: 77 percent of LGBTQ health grant dollars are directed toward a specific racial group, sexual or gender identity, age group, or other demographic. This reflects philanthropic responses to specific health disparities faced by particular identity groups.For sexual orientation and gender identity, gay men and men who have sex with men were the target population of the largest share of dollars—$10.8 million.  Ninety-six percent of these dollars were for HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. The second largest share of LGBTQ health funding targeted lesbians and other queer-identified women: $4 million, 83 percent of which was for breast cancer. About $2.9 million targeted transgender people, 34 percent of which was to advance inclusive health insurance coverage and health care reform implementation. Only $82,500 targeted intersex communities. No known LGBTQ health grants explicitly targeted bisexuals, although some of the funding targeting gay men and men who have sex with men undoubtedly supported services for significant numbers of bisexual-identified men.LGBTQ Health Grant Dollars Targeting Specific Sexual & Gender Identities2011-2013$10,790,616Gay/Queer Men/MSM$4,015,200Lesbian/Queer Women$2,850,414Transgender$82,500IntersexNearly $11.4 million—or 22 percent of LGBTQ health funding—targeted LGBTQ communities of color. Approximately $4 million targeted African Americans, and another $5.2 million targeted communities of color broadly, with smaller amounts focused on Latinos, Asian American/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans. HIV/AIDS funding accounts for the majority of LGBTQ health grant dollars targeting communities of color.LGBTQ Health Grant Dollars Targeting People of Color2011-2013$5,228,423People of Color - General$4,072,683African American/Black$1,287,464Latino$644,955Asian/Pacific Islander$247,594Native AmericanSignificant LGBTQ health grant dollars targeted several other key population groups. In particular, $9.8 million targeted LGBTQ children and youth, and nearly $3 million targeted LGBTQ older adults.

The geographic focus of LGBTQ health funding is closely tied to the strategy funded; 80 percent of local dollars are devoted to direct services, and 41 percent of national dollars are devoted to advocacy.In contrast, for all LGBTQ funding overall, a full half of dollars are devoted to national work, much of it for policy and advocacy.Distrubution of Grant Dollars by Geographic Focus2011-2013NationalRegionalStateLocal Domestic LGBTQ Health Funding All Domestic LGBTQ Funding  Domestic LGBTQ Health Funding 2011-2013  All Domestic LGBTQ Funding 2011-2013 Local $35,970,099 71% $99,813,753 33%State $3,474,128 7% $43,166,929 14%Regional $332,325 1% $9,467,561 3%National $10,712,452 21% $147,743,087 50%$50,489,005 100% $300,191,330 100%Of the approximately $40 million awarded to LGBTQ health at the local, state, and regional levels, the largest share ($17.5 million) was devoted to the Northeast region.

In the Northeast, the majority of funding ($11.1 million) was focused on New York. More than 88 percent of funding for the Pacific was for California—three-quarters of which was provided by funders based in California, such as The California Endowment and The California Wellness Foundation. Nearly half of Midwest funding went to Illinois, and nearly 60 percent of Southern funding focused on Florida or Texas. Each of these relatively well-funded states is home to major urban centers with large LGBTQ communities and a number of HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ-focused service providers. The disparities between states points to the challenges of addressing LGBTQ health issues outside of urban centers, and to the need for deeper engagement of more local funders in states beyond the coasts.State and Local Funding for LGBTQ Health by Target State2011-2013<100K0100-200K200-500K500K-1M1M-3M>3MAlabama $34,000Alaska $500Arizona $66,650California $7,904,237Colorado $213,226Connecticut $403,906District of Columbia $1,546,271Florida $1,401,500Georgia $821,429Hawaii $6,073Idaho $32,500Illinois $2,600,698Indiana $145,500Iowa $1,000Kentucky $408,015Louisiana $306,000Maine $138,780Maryland $1,805,532Massachusetts $1,131,790Michigan $977,552Minnesota $408,369Mississippi $170,000Missouri $262,352Montana $28,100Nevada $50,855New Jersey $399,122New Mexico $336,338New York $11,121,399North Carolina $146,850North Dakota $60,000Ohio $102,951Oklahoma $158,500Oregon $362,806Pennsylvania $885,307Puerto Rico $40,000Rhode Island $23,650South Carolina $25,000Tennessee $46,000Texas $2,630,548Utah $201,164Vermont $74,500Virginia $381,341Washington $624,392Wisconsin $945,510Note: Does not include $14,015 awarded to anonymous individuals in undisclosed regions.22    Vital  Funding STRATEGYLooking at LGBTQ health funding by the types of strategies funded, direct services garnered the majority (62 percent) of grant dollars. This was followed by advocacy (17 percent), capacity building and training (8 percent), research (5 percent) and culture and media (5 percent). In contrast, advocacy is the predominant strategy for LGBTQ funding overall, followed by capacity building, and then by direct services.Distribution of Grant Dollars by Strategy2011-2013All LGBTQFunding Domestic LGBTQ Health Funding 62% Direct Service 15% Direct Service17% Advocacy 47% Advocacy8% Capacity-Building 15% Capacity-Building2% Philanthropy 3% Philanthropy5% Culture & Media 7% Culture & Media5% Research 8% Research1% Multi/Other 4% Multi/OtherDomestic LGBTQ Health Funding All LGBTQ FundingDirect Service $31,052,701 62% $54,413,570 15%Advocacy $8,465,454 17% $177,332,672 47%Capacity Building $4,108,713 8% $55,790,537 15%Culture & Media $2,730,268 5% $25,635,432 7%Research $2,453,134 5% $31,474,497 8%Philanthropy & Fundraising $930,475 2% $12,774,393 3%Multiple/Other Strategies $748,260 1% $13,670,682 4%$50,489,005 100% $371,091,783 100%Vital  Funding    23Funding Opportunities24    Vital  Funding RECOMMENDATIONSThis report is largely intended as a starting point for a longer assessment and series of conversations about potential high-impact funding strategies to improve the health and well-being of LGBTQ communities. However, the data herein do highlight several key gaps and opportunities for funders seeking to advance health and wellbeing in LGBTQ communities.Explore Collaborative Efforts to Address Mental and Behavioral Health and Other Social Determinants Related to StigmaLGBTQ communities face an especially severe disease burden in mental and behavioral health. These challenges are driven by the stigma and marginalization related to homophobia and transphobia, which are also key social determinants of HIV/AIDS and other health disparities. This is an area that relates to the priorities of a range of funders, including LGBTQ-focused funders, HIV/AIDS funders, and funders broadly concerned about health disparities and inequity.Increase Access to Insurance Coverage for LGBTQ PeopleThe Affordable Care Act is rapidly shifting the health policy landscape and increasing access to health insurance. Funders have an opportunity to assure that coverage outreach efforts reach LGBTQ populations, and that insurance providers do not discriminate against LGBTQ people—especially when it comes to medical care for transgender people.Build Capacity of the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ Health Services SectorThere is a rich array of community-based organizations providing health services specifically for the LGBTQ community, including HIV/AIDS service organizations, LGBTQ health centers, community centers, and counseling and referrals hotlines. These service providers have unparalleled cultural competence when it comes to serving LGBTQ communities. However, many lack the resources to meet the full range of needs of their communities or are heavily reliant on one or a handful of government contracts. Particularly given the current shifting health policy climate, funders have an opportunity to build the capacity of these agencies, to expand the scope of their work and to develop sustainable revenue strategies.Increase LGBTQ Cultural Competence of Health Service Providers and SystemsMany LGBTQ people may never be able to take advantage of LGBTQ-focused service providers, particularly in rural and less densely populated areas. Funders have an opportunity to support training, curriculum development, and other efforts to increase the cultural competence of hospitals, health centers, and other mainstream health care providers, so as to maximize their ability to effectively serve LGBTQ communities. Key areas include increasing competence in providing transition-related care for transgender people and providing sexual health and HIV prevention services that are sensitive, relevant, and empowering for LGBTQ communities.Strengthen HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ Health Policy and Advocacy InfrastructureThe LGBTQ movement has built a fairly robust set of organizations for policy advocacy at the national and state levels, but much of this infrastructure has focused on civil rights issues such as marriage equality and protections from discrimination. Much of the HIV/AIDS infrastructure in the U.S. has shifted to a services focus, with only a small number of organizations focused on advocacy for people living with HIV. Funders have an opportunity to support LGBTQ and HIV/AIDS organizations in building advocacy programs around the health policy issues that affect LGBTQ communities, including inclusive implementation of ACA exchanges, repeal of HIV criminalization laws, improving data collection on sexual orientation and gender identity, and providing government funding for health services for LGBTQ communities.Vital  Funding    25NOTES1.

For these reports, requests for grant information were sent to nearly 700 grantmakers. All types of foundations were surveyed - private, public, community, and corporate - as well as nonprofit organizations with grantmaking programs. Information was obtained predominantly through self-reporting by grantmakers, as well as a review of 990s and annual reports.This report specifically focuses on funding for LGBTQ health issues in the United States and captures grants made to support organizations as well as programs and projects.The data does not include health grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTQ populations unless they explicitly target LGBTQ communities or address an LGBTQ health issue. For example, a grant awarded to a local community center to support a breast cancer awareness campaign, open and welcoming to lesbians, would not have been included in the data. If that same center was funded to launch a breast cancer awareness campaign specifically targeting lesbians, then the grant would have been included.Re-granting dollars are included in charts that rank individual grantmakers to accurately show the overall level of LGBTQ funding provided by each grantmaker. As a result, the charts that rank grantmakers “double-count” re-granting when aggregated. However, for all other tabulations and charts, we have not included dollars awarded for the purpose of re-granting, so as to avoid double counting.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThank you to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, whose support made this report possible.Many thanks to our LGBT Health Funding Summit Planning Committee, who guided the development of this report and provided helpful feedback on early drafts. We would also like to acknowledge member and long-time board member Andrew Lane, who also provided helpful feedback and guidance.

    "abstract": "This report assesses the scale and character of foundation funding for the health and well-being of LGBTQ communities. Drawing on the data collected for annual tracking reports on LGBTQ funding, we find that domestic foundation funding for LGBTQ health totaled $50.4 million for 2011 - 2013. Considering the magnitude of the health disparities facing LGBTQ communities, this is a fairly modest amount -- and it is highly dependent on a small set of dedicated funders. When it comes to LGBTQ health, we face daunting challenges, but we also have impressive assets to build on. As a community and as a movement, we have time and again demonstrated our ability to come together to support one another, to advocate for ourselves, and to build lasting institutions. Across the country, there are hundreds of LGBTQ community centers, health centers, and HIV/AIDS service agencies, and other community groups advancing LGBTQ health. There are also a growing number of non-LGBTQ-focused institutions -- from hospitals to research centers -- seeking to improve their competence, expertise, and effectiveness in working with LGBTQ communities",
