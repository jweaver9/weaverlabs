A LETTER FROM OURDIRECTORDr. Wendy Hoofnagle Greetings! I hope you are all enjoying the emergence of spring weather at last.It seemed like a very long winter this year, but we were very busy in WGS allthe same (as this newsletter can attest to!).This past year has seen enormous growth for the program – we have welcomedtwelve new members to the Advisory Board, including an elected graduatestudent member; staff from the Center for Multicultural Education and theGender and Sexuality Center; and faculty from the Rod Library and severalcolleges across campus. We are also pleased to introduce our new graduatestudent cohort: just this past spring, we had three new students join mid-year(one of whom is a Fulbright scholar) in addition to admitting eight newstudents for the coming year (four of whom are Fulbright scholars). It is anexciting time for the WGS Program, to be sure! To encourage participation in WGS-related activities on campus and promotethe creation of classes focusing on sexuality and gender, we created two newawards that we hope to begin granting next year: the WGS Faculty and StaffExcellence Award and the LGBTQ* Curriculum Award. Along these lines, wealso revised the format of the annual CROW (Current Research on Women)Forum to the SWAG (Sexuality, Women and Gender) Forum, in order toencourage a wider variety of subjects and presentation styles (includingworkshops) to appeal to a more general audience and increase participation.This new format is more inclusive and embraces research on gender andsexualities through multiple perspectives. It is my hope, moving forward, thatthese initiatives will increase the visibility of the program and its activities aswell as recognize the efforts of faculty, students, and staff in these areas;without their support and enthusiasm, none of this work would be possible. We have a busy summer ahead in the WGS office as we begin work on othercurricular and programmatic initiatives, so I look forward to sharing moreprogress with you in our fall newsletter. I welcome your questions, thoughts,and suggestions as we move forward during this crucial period in our history,both inside and outside the university. Please feel free to stop by the WGSoffice and chat, give me a call, or send an email. I would love to hear fromyou! Best wishes for a summer of fun and relaxation, wherever your travels may takeyou! Wendy Marie Hoofnagle   WHY WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES?(continued from front page) When we consider the continuum of violence andoppression in our societies, it is vital to critically analyze these issues from differentperspectives. Our program and those l ike it undoubtedly offer a wider view of suchissues and expand into other areas where oppression is highly present such as sexism,racism, exploitation and socioeconomic differences. Our Women’s and Gender Studies classes explore the social, political, and culturalconstruction of gender, as well as the history, experiences and achievements ofwomen and other marginalized populations. For instance, our “Comparative FeministTheories” core class assists students in understanding past and present feministtheories and in evaluating practices, beliefs, and standards about gender that shapeour daily experiences. The program also highlights critical thinking across disciplines,and so the knowledge and skil ls our students gain are applicable to a variety of otherstudies, programs, and careers. Our students respect and have insight intodifferences, a trait that is a key to success in any career path.  By engaging in Women’s and Gender Studies, you not only find a more accuratepicture of history, but also become aware of the ways in which we can learn, developand move things in the right direction from here on, for future generations.  Careers in WGSA degree in Women’s and Gender Studies preparesyou for a myriad of professions! The interdisciplinarynature of the program introduces students tohistorical events, engages them in exploring complexsocial structures, and addressing injustice andoppressive systems. Undoubtedly, many employersprefer liberal arts graduates, knowing that liberalarts education focuses on critical thinking, writing,and presentation skills. A Women’s and GenderStudies degree provides all these and many otherbenefits.sexual assault/domestic violence advocatedirector of human rights organizationk-12 teachervictim counselortherapist specializing in LGBTQ+ or sexual violencesocial workerprofessor or academicnon-profit or foundation directoruniversity diversity and inclusion  coordinator human rights lawyer shelter manager PROGRAMMINGNEWSGalentine's Day Galentine’s Day is about women celebrating eachother and their friendships.
