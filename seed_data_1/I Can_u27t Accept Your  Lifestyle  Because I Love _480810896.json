I analyze how Mississippi Christians make sense of theirrelationships with gay and lesbian friends and family members and how this differs based on their religious identity. I then consider how these beliefs and attitudes are influenced by social contact with gays and lesbians. I find Mississippi Christians’ views toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights vary widely from rejection to acceptance.  The most conservative views are held by evangelical Protestants who set themselves apart from society through their beliefs about homosexuality.  They feel that homosexuality is always sinful and describe almost complete opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights. On the contrary, mainline Protestants continue to move towards full assimilation with secular society. Many believe the Bible does not say anything about homosexuality and that the church should be accepting of gays and lesbians. Mainline Protestants also largely support gay and lesbian civil rights. Catholics fall in the middle          of the continuum.  They describe a greater degree of ambivalence about the sinfulness of homosexuality and describe conditional acceptance of gay and lesbian civil rights. Social contact with gays and lesbians did not influence evangelical Protestants beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality or gay and lesbian civil rights.  Similarly, conservative Catholics continued to hold on to their more conservative religious beliefs about homosexuality despite social contact. Conservative Christians’ subcultural identity which stands in opposition to homosexuality is stronger than the effects of social contact for evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. On the other hand, social contact is often a strong enough influence to change beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights for mainline Protestants and more liberal Catholics. This study demonstrates that conservative religion acts as a negative feature that deters the positive benefits of social contact to overcome prejudice.

I consider how these beliefs and attitudes are influenced by social contact with gays and lesbians. Through surveys and in-depthinterviews, I demonstrate how Mississippi Christians think about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights based on religious affiliation. I analyze how they make sense of their relationships with gays and lesbians while simultaneously practicing a religion many respondents interpret to condemn homosexuality. Then I examine whether having a gay or lesbian friend and/or family member affects these beliefs and attitudes. Social contact theory suggests when members of an ingroup have adequate social contact with members of an outgroup, they will develop more positive beliefs and attitudes toward thatgroup.According to Hogg and Abrams (1988), when individuals share some type of social identification (e.g. religion, race, sexuality) they often view themselves as part of a shared social category, or ingroup. They develop a sense of membership in these groups, and based on these feelings, see those who differ as members of the outgroup. This social categorization process often leads to negative attitudes and stereotypes toward outgroup members. Allport (1954) suggests the negative effects of categorization can be overcome when outgroups engage in social contact with each other.1                             Here, I examine Mississippi Christians as an ingroup. I consider how MississippiChristians other gays and lesbians as an outgroup and how this often leads to negative beliefs and attitudes toward this population. I first look at how Mississippi Christiansunderstand their religion and how this influences their beliefs about homosexuality. Ishow Mississippi Christians have varying beliefs about the sinfulness of homosexualitybased on religious affiliation. Next, I explain how these religious beliefs are translatedinto opinions about gay and lesbian civil rights. Specifically, I discuss MississippiChristians’ beliefs about same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement more generally. Finally, I turn to social contact with gays and lesbians and attempt to show how these relationships affect Mississippi Christians’ views of homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Based on previous research, increased social contact with gays and lesbians should lead to less prejudicial beliefs and attitudestoward this population, as well as increased support of gay and lesbian civil rights (e.g. same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, the right of gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military, etc.). I explore whether the positive effects of social contact are strong enough to overcome conservative religious beliefs that often condemn homosexuality.Changing attitudes towards gays and lesbians in the United StatesApproximately ten years ago, attitudes towards gay and lesbian civil rights in the United States began to shift toward greater support for more rights. The attitudinal shift became obvious in 2003 when the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled only marriage could provide same-sex couples with equality in the Goodridge et al. v. TheDepartment of Public Health. This decision meant same-sex couples in Massachusetts2                 could begin legally marrying in May 2004 (HRC 2013a). After this decision, public opinion began to shift rapidly.For the first time in 2010 and then again in 2011, CNN and Gallup Polls recorded a slight majority of Americans in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage (CNN 2010; Gallup 2011). In addition to marriage equality, on September 20, 2011 the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, signed by President Obama, took effect, making discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation illegal in the military (CBS News 2011).On June 26, 2013 with Windsor v. United States, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitutional, providing legally married same-sex couples federal marriage benefits (Freedom to Marry 2013a).Now, a little over a decade after the Massachusetts decision took effect, 37 states and the District of Columbia have authorized same-sex marriage as legal (Freedom to Marry 2015b). Today, 72 percent of people in the United States live in a state with marriage equality (Freedom to Marry 2015b). In addition to these rapid changes in marriage equality on a state-by-state basis, the United States Supreme Court is set to make a ruling on same-sex marriages in June 2015. The expected outcome is federallegalization of same-sex marriage throughout the United States. These are only a few of the many changes that have taken place over the last decade that indicate a rapid shift in beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian civil rights.Despite the tremendous gains for gay and lesbian civil rights, there remains a substantial minority who continue to oppose these rights. The most vocal among these opponents are conservative Christians (Saucier and Cawman 2004; Olson et al. 2006; Fetner 2001, 2008; Sherkat 2009). From radical opponents such as Fred Phelps’ 3                  Westboro Baptist Church picketing funerals and holding public protests with signs thatread, “God hates fags” or “Death penalty for fags”, to relatively more moderate Christian organizations such as Concerned Women for America whose brochures promote “traditional” marriage between a man and a woman, the Religious Right continues to oppose gay and lesbian equality (Fetner 2001, 2008; Schreiber 2008).Why do conservative Christians oppose gay and lesbian equality?In spite of the numerous accounts showing religion, especially conservative Christianity, increases prejudices towards certain groups (Johnson, Brems, and Alford-Keating 1997; Duck and Hunsberger 1999; Werum and Winders 2001; Finlay and Walther 2003; Schulte and Battle 2004; Olson et al. 2006; Rowatt et al. 2006; Fetner2001, 2008; McVeigh and Diaz 2009; Scheitle and Hahn 2011), there has been little effort to understand this prejudice. Preconceived notions of religion as unchangeable and always salient have lead scholars to stop short of understanding why Christians continue to hold increased prejudice towards outgroups. Biblical passages are quoted as justification for opposition to homosexuality, but few have stopped to examine the mechanisms that lead conservative Christians to oppose gay and lesbian civil rights.Taking Biblical literalism as a complete justification for opposition to homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights has halted further investigation into the reasons behind conservative Christians’ arguments. Accepting this singular argument of opposition leaves use with only a partial understanding of this topic at best. This study seeks to remedy this problem by considering the justifications behind the opposition.Conservative Christians’ explanations of their religious beliefs, and how these relate to gay and lesbian civil rights, shows a much more detailed and ambiguous view of 4                    homosexuality than previous research. Conservative Christians’ nuanced understandings and explanations of how they overcome the inconsistencies between their personal relationships with gays and lesbians and their conservative religious beliefs about homosexuality reveals a much more in-depth thought process than merely acceptance or rejection. Overcoming the cognitive dissonance between religious beliefs and personal relationships leads to ambiguous and complicated belief systems that need furtherexploration and explanation. By examining this topic more carefully, I argue it is not ‘hate’ (hostility or intolerance towards gays and lesbians) per se that drives most Christians to oppose gay and lesbian civil rights or homosexuality more generally. However, the mechanisms thatlead other Americans to have more positive attitudes towards gays and lesbians, such as social contact, do not produce the same positive effects among Christians, specifically conservative Christians. These mechanisms are insufficient due to conservativeChristians’ religious beliefs, not merely fear or hate of gays and lesbians. Certainly, there are those driven to oppose gay and lesbian civil rights by homophobia and hatred, but they constitute only a minority of a larger population opposed to gay and lesbian equality.Many conservative Christians who oppose gay and lesbian civil rights argue they do so from a place of love and compassion. Since many conservative Christians truly feelhomosexuality is sinful and harmful to the individual and society, they sincerely believeit is their Christian duty to help gays and lesbians overcome this “sin”. At this important time in American history when gay and lesbian civil rights have taken center stage, it is critical to understand those who continue to oppose civil rights for this population. In order for advocates of gay and lesbian equality to effect change it is 5                  helpful to understand the beliefs and attitudes of their opposition. Since conservative Christian groups take a lead role in speaking out against equal rights for gay and lesbian individuals (Fetner 2008) it is important to consider what factors are effective in decreasing inaccurate beliefs and negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians among this population. Reducing prejudice based on sexuality is vital because individuals who arestigmatized due to their sexual orientation have less access to resources and less control over their own lives (Herek 2011).Many have attempted to understand the mechanisms that lead to prejudice oracceptance of others, who are different from oneself in a variety of ways including race, ethnicity, religion, etc. (e.g. Wittig and Grant-Thompson 1998; Tavares 2011). The two mechanisms I explore are religion and social contact, and how they work together or contradict one another in regards to prejudice and oppression. I chose to examine these mechanisms in the South, specifically Mississippi, due to the larger proportion of adherents to conservative religion and because the South is a location where gays and lesbians are often vilified or made invisible (Howard 1999; Johnson 2008; Pew Forum 2008). Through measures of religious identity, beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, and social contact, I am able to answer my primary research questions: What do Mississippi Christians believe about homosexuality and how do these beliefs vary based on religious affiliation? What do Mississippi Christians believe about gay and lesbian civil rights and how do these beliefs vary based on religious affiliation? What influence does social contact with gays and lesbians have on these beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights? How do Christians reconcile their religious beliefs with their personal 6                           relationships with gay and lesbian individuals? Finally, how does this reconciliation work similarly or differently based on religious category? I attempt to understand how social contact with gays and lesbians interacts with religious beliefs to influence Mississippi Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality, as well as gay and lesbian civilrights. I expand previous research by offering a more complete measure of social contact.In addition, I allow interview respondents ample opportunity to explain the nuanced reasons having a friend or family member who is gay or lesbian affects or does not affecttheir opinions about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights.Drawing from 144 surveys and 40 in-depth interviews with Mississippi Christians, I argue for a reconsideration of what leads to Christians’ opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights and how to properly address this issue. I attempt to provide a clear explanation of why social contact with gays and lesbians alone is not sufficient for changing many Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality. Although I do not argue my results are generalizable to all Christians, or even all Mississippi Christians, I do believe they provide an exploratory look into the beliefs and opinions of Christians more generally.The ambivalence and contradictions that appear to be inherent within religion indicate we have to dig deeper to truly understand what an individual or group believes about moral and social issues. We cannot simply rely on what an elite leader says or whatwe interpret the Bible to say to understand the stance a Christian will take on an issue.We must heed the advice of Smith (2000) and others that in order to truly understand Christians’ beliefs and practices we have to talk to them and observe them. While survey data helps to provide a broad picture of the effects of social contact on Mississippi7                         Christians, interviews capture the complexity and ambivalence prevalent in Mississippi Christians’ beliefs.Overview of study In Chapter II, I clearly define the religious categories being used for this study. As any type of labeling can be problematic, I take care to explain the reasons and ways Icategorize individual respondents in order to gain a more general understanding of how religion affects various groups. I then lay out the theoretical background for this study. I begin by exploring the current research on religion and prejudice in the United States. I provide an overview of the data concerning Christians’ beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Next, I turn to the literature on social contact theory (Allport 1954; Pettigrew 1998) and subcultural identity theory (Smith et al. 1998) to provide a framework for understanding why social contact does not have the same effects on conservative Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality that it has on the population more generally. In Chapter III, I provide an overview of the data and methods for this study. I begin by describing the religious landscape in the United States, the South, and Mississippi. I explain my justification for using Mississippi as a location of analysis. Next, I give a detailed description of survey and interview participants and explain my methods for analysis.In Chapters IV through VI, I present the findings from the surveys and interviews with Mississippi Christians. Chapter IV explores Mississippi Christians’ views about the Bible and their religious beliefs about homosexuality using both survey and interview data. Specifically, I attempt to show how Mississippi Christians form their religious 8                        views about homosexuality. I examine how individuals and groups differently interpret what the Bible and church doctrine says about homosexuality.Chapter V provides an overview of Mississippi Christians’ beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights. Using both survey and interview data, I show overall Mississippi Christians are more opposed to gay and lesbian civil rights than the general population.Additionally, I look at how these beliefs and attitudes differ based on religious categories.I specifically examine respondents’ answers for three issues dealing with gay and lesbian civil rights: same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and beliefs about the gay and lesbian civil rights movement.In Chapter VI, I explore the survey and interview results concerning socialcontact and how social contact works differently based on religious categories. Based on interview data, I explain how subcultural boundary work overrides the positive effects of social contact for many Mississippi Christians. I provide examples to show the nuance and ambiguity of Mississippi Christians’ belief systems about homosexuality and examine how some respondents attempt to overcome the cognitive dissonance created by believing in a conservative Christian ideology while simultaneously having a friend or family member who identifies as gay or lesbian.Chapter VII explores what these findings mean for gay and lesbian civil rights in the United States and provides recommendations for how this information can be used to bring about positive social change for gays and lesbians in America. Overall, I findMississippi Christians’ views toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights vary widely from outright rejection to unqualified acceptance.  The most conservative views are held by evangelical Protestants. They set themselves apart from society through their9                   beliefs about homosexuality. Evangelical Protestants usually argue homosexuality isalways sinful and believe gays and lesbians should attempt to change their sexuality. According to Smith et al.’s (1998) subcultural identity theory, evangelical Protestants conservative beliefs set them apart and allow them to thrive as a religion. They use thisdistinction as an important identity marker. Mainline Protestants, on the other hand, continue to move towards full assimilation with secular society. Many believe the Bible does not say anything about homosexuality and that Christians should fully accept gays and lesbians. Catholics fall in the middle of the continuum.  They describe a greaterdegree of ambivalence about the sinfulness of homosexuality and neither fully accommodate with the larger society nor do they appear to be embattled by it. The same continuum is evident when it comes to the issue of gay and lesbian civilrights. Mainline Protestants largely support gay and lesbian civil rights. Catholics again inhabit the middle ground; most attempt to balance the competing ideas of equality with the conservative teachings of the Catholic Church.  This often leads to conditional acceptance of gay and lesbian civil rights. On the other end of the spectrum, evangelical Protestants describe almost complete opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights. While Mississippi Christians report high levels of social contact with gays and lesbians, the effects of this contact varied based on religious affiliation. Social contact with gays and lesbians did not influence evangelical Protestants beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian civil rights.  Similarly, conservative Catholics continued to hold on to their more conservative religious beliefs about homosexuality despite social contact.  Despite having family members and friends who are gay or lesbian, evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics continue to argue homosexuality is sinful and 10                    either oppose or only conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights.  Conservative Christians’ subcultural identity which stands in opposition to homosexuality is stronger than the effects of social contact for evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. On the other hand, social contact is often a strong enough influence to change beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights for mainline Protestants and more liberal Catholics. It is only with these groups that we see the positive effects of social contact that previous literature suggests.  Therefore, this study demonstrates that conservative religion acts as a negative feature that deters the positive benefits of socialcontact to overcome prejudice.This study is important because previous research has not sufficiently shown the nuanced reasons Christians hold more prejudicial beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. In addition, this study shows attempts to change conservative Christians’ beliefs about this topic by encouraging gays and lesbian to come out or attacking homophobia will remain futile. A new approach is needed for reaching conservative Christians who oppose gay and lesbian civil rights. New strategiesare necessary for conservative Christians that enable them to hold onto their strong religious identity without limiting equality of their gay and lesbian friends and family members. 11               CHAPTER IILITERATURE REVIEWI begin this chapter by clearly defining the religious categories I use for analysis in this study. Defining religious categories has received much attention within the sociology of religion (Smith 2000; Hempel & Bartkowski 2008). Scholars stressresearchers must be absolutely clear how they are classifying individuals and groups into religious categories; therefore, I explicitly explain my classification system here. Next, I provide the theoretical framing for this study. In order to understand the ways various groups of Christians in Mississippi address the issue of homosexuality, I review the literature on the correlation between religion and prejudice. Here scholars point to the fact that religion, particularly conservative religion, leads individuals to hold moreprejudicial attitudes towards outgroups. This increased prejudice towards individuals who identify as gay or lesbian often leads conservative Christians to oppose gay and lesbian civil rights.Finally, I discuss the implications of both social contact theory (Allport 1954) and subcultural identity theory (Smith et al. 1998) for explaining how individuals form their identity based on group memberships and how contact between various groups can lead to improved relations between categories. I examine subcultural identity theory (Smith et al. 1998), as a type of social identity work, in order to explore how opposition to homosexuality is used as a boundary for Christian identity among conservative 12                    Christians. I then turn to social contact theory which suggests having contact with members of an outgroup improves relations with that group and question whether this theory’s explanatory power is reduced among conservative Christians.By considering how social contact impacts Mississippi Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward gays and lesbians, this research challenges the understanding of social contact as an always sufficient means of overcoming prejudice. As Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) explain, most previous research has shown only the positive effects of social contact in overcoming prejudice and failed to consider social contact may not beadequate in all instances. They call for further analysis to explain what factors prevent social contact from having a positive impact. In addition to the research that only focuses on the positive effects of social contact, this theme is also evident within the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. Activists often call on gays and lesbians to come out the closet in order to overcome prejudice (Lewis 2011). The assumption behind this push for gays and lesbians to reveal their sexuality to their family members and friends is that it will always have a positive effect in reducing prejudice and overcoming stereotypes.However, if social contact does not always lead to improved beliefs and attitudes, thiscould be an inadequate strategy at best.Many studies have considered separately how religion leads to prejudice and howsocial contact has the ability to overcome prejudice, respectively, but few studiesconsider what happens when social contact and religion are combined (but see Baunach, Burgess, and Muse 2010; Bramlett 2012; Baker and Brauner-Otto 2014). Does social contact continue to challenge prejudice? Or does religion overpower social contact and support prejudice? Does social contact have the same impact on all categories of religious 13              people? By focusing on Mississippi Christians, I examine how religious identities andbeliefs interact with social contact with outgroups, specifically gays and lesbians, to influence views about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Defining religious categories Religion is a complex and multifaceted social institution. Even within denominations and congregations beliefs vary tremendously. According to Smith (2000:17), there are no direct variables to measure religious group affiliation, “only proxy measures that work more or less well to mark them.” Therefore, any study of religionmust begin with a clear description of the categories being examined. For this study, Mississippi Christians are divided into three key categories: evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, and Catholics. Below I provide a brief description of each category.Evangelical ProtestantsThe current form of evangelicalism, or neo-evangelicalism, began in the early 1940s (Smith 2000, Hankins 2008). Evangelicalism is a transdenominational Protestant movement (Smith et al. 1998). According to Hankins (2008:1), approximately one-third of Americans identify as evangelical or conservative Protestants. Smith (2000) argues although evangelicalism is difficult to measure, there are three principal ways to measure this movement – denominational affiliation, theological belief, and self-identification.Bartkowski (2001, 2004) explains conservative Protestants’ epistemology, ontology, and soteriology are distinctive from other Protestants. Conservative Protestants’ epistemology (assumptions about knowledge and truth) holds scripture is the inspired word of God and without error. The ontology (assumptions about human nature and the nature of the 14              world) of conservative Protestants’ suggest sin is “the pervasiveness of evil and punishment of sinners” (Hempel & Bartkowski 2008:1649). Finally, conservative Protestants’ soteriology (assumptions about how to be saved) advocate salvation can only come through Jesus. Evangelical Protestants believe the only way to be saved and go to Heaven is through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. This means it is not a person’s works, or good deeds, that save them. Rather, a person gains salvation by accepting that Jesus died on the cross for them and only he can save them from their sinful nature.Mainline ProtestantsMainline Protestants belong to “a branch of Protestantism encompassing what are considered theologically liberal and moderate denominations” (ARDA 2014).Approximately 18 percent of religiously affiliated individuals in the United States are members of one of the 23 mainline denominations (Pew Forum 2008; ARDA 2014). In contrast to evangelicals, many mainline Protestants “[do] not express clear and straightforward commitments to traditionally orthodox Christian theological beliefs and ethics” (Smith et al. 1998:52). For example, Smith et al. (1998:52) found some mainline Protestants felt “ultimate religious truth was essentially a matter of personal taste,” not an objective fact based on theology. In addition, mainline Protestants also held different views about salvation and many tend to minimize or erase the differences between Christianity and other religions (Smith et al. 1998). Smith et al. (1998:55) also find for many mainline Protestants’ “faith was often conceived of as a rather taken-for-granted aspect of a general lifestyle, not as an intense personal commitment that provided indispensable order and meaning to their lives.” 15                     Overall, mainline Protestants differ from evangelicals in their beliefs about scripture, sin, and salvation. They hold a much more loose and flexible understanding of faith and morality that leads them to question the absolute truth or fact of Christian theology. These differences help to explain why evangelicalism continues to thrive, while mainline Protestantism is on the decline. Smith et al. (1998) argues evangelical Protestants thrive because of the boundaries and distinctions they create between their group and other groups. Mainline Protestants, on the other hand, do not attempt to setthemselves apart from society in the same way. Rather, mainline Protestants engage with society and are more open to differences in beliefs and ideology. Smith et al. (1998)suggest by not distinguishing themselves from the larger society, mainline Protestantismhas lost its distinctiveness, which has led to its decline. A recent study conducted by the Pew Research Center (Pew Forum 2015) found mainline Protestants have declined by 3.4 percent as a share of the US population between 2007 and 2014.  During this same period, evangelical Protestants declined less than one percent.  I will return to this point below.Catholics Catholicism is the largest denomination in the United States (Konieczny 2013).Approximately 29 percent of religiously affiliated individuals in America claimmembership in a Catholic church (Konieczny 2013).  However, the share of Catholics in the US is declining at a similar rate to mainline Protestants.  Between 2007 and 2014, the share of Catholics in the US declined by 3.1 percent (Pew Forum 2015). UnlikeProtestants who divide into different denominations based on specific theological and social beliefs, Catholics pride themselves on remaining one officially united Church 16                     (Manning 1999; Konieczny 2013). Because of this there is a wider range of beliefs and opinions within Catholic churches – when differences in belief occur, Catholics do not splinter off into separate churches. Manning (1999) clearly describes in her book God Gave Us the Right that both liberal and conservative Catholics work side by side within the same church organizations. Konieczny (2013:1) suggests this “historically valued and maintained unity among diverse peoples with a plurality of perspectives, traditions, and ways of living” makes Catholicism a fertile ground for studying controversial socialissues.Despite diversity, Catholics do have a central set of theological beliefs they hold as the core to Catholic identity (D’Antonio, Dillon, and Gautier 2013). For example, about 75 percent of Catholics indicate a belief in Jesus’s resurrection from the dead is important to them personally (D’Antonio et al. 2013). However, today the majority of Catholics across the United States do not feel the Vatican’s teaching authority is necessary for Catholic faith; for most, what it means to be a good Catholics is notdependent on the Church’s authority or hierarchy. D’Antonio et al. (2013) find only 35 percent of Catholics indicate the Church’s opposition to same-sex marriage is very important to them. Only about one-quarter to one-third of Catholics continue to accept the complete authority of the Church (D’Antonio et al. 2013).With these categories in mind, I now consider how individuals form social groups and how social contact between these groups has the potential to improve relationsbetween groups. Then, I explore how subcultural identity theory may be used to explain why social contact does not have the same positive benefits for conservative Mississippi Christians. In addition, I examine how conservative Christian gender ideology is related 17               to beliefs about homosexuality for Mississippi Christians. I argue sexuality, specifically opposition to homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, is being used by conservative Christians as a revised gender boundary to set them apart from the rest ofsociety. Since conservative gender ideology is becoming less practical in the United States, I argue opposition to homosexuality is replacing this ideology. The close link between gender and sexuality enables conservative Christians to hold on to conservative gender ideology through opposition to homosexuality, while letting go of the less practical standards of wifely submission and single earner households.Religion & prejudicePrevious research indicates Christians are typically more prejudiced than the general population (Duck & Hunsberger 1999; Emerson & Smith 2000; Rowatt et al.2006; Hill et al. 2010; Bramlett 2012). The more a person believes their religion holds absolute truths, the more likely they are to hold negative views towards gays and lesbians (Rowatt et al. 2006). A large body of research links negative beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality directly to one’s religious identity and beliefs (Johnson, Brems, and Alford-Keating 1997; Duck and Hunsberger 1999; Werum and Winders 2001; Finlay and Walther 2003; Schulte and Battle 2004; Olson et al. 2006; Rowatt et al. 2006; Fetner2001, 2008; McVeigh and Diaz 2009; Scheitle and Hahn 2011). Of those with Christian identities, evangelical Christians are more likely to condemn homosexuality and express prejudice towards gays and lesbians (Duck & Hunsberger 1999; Hill et al. 2010) and are less likely to support gay and lesbian civil rights than mainline Protestants (Sherkat et al. 2011). Similarly, Hinrichs & Rosenberg (2002:79) find “those who belong to morefundamentalist religious groups, who have a higher level of traditional religious beliefs,18                and/or who attend religious services more frequently have more negative attitudes toward gay, lesbian, and bisexual persons than those with lower religiosity.”Mechanisms by which religious belief turns into prejudiceHow, then, does religion translate into negative beliefs and attitudes towards gays and lesbians? Scholars point to three important mechanisms through which religious beliefs shape prejudice: 1) individuals’ overall belief systems, 2) specific beliefs about the origins of an individual’s homosexuality, and 3) perceived threat (Wilkinson 2004; McVeigh and Diaz 2009; Whitley 2009; Hill et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011). Since many religions condemn homosexuality, individuals within these belief systems often internalize these negative beliefs toward gays and lesbians (Hill et al. 2010). That is, because their overall belief system indicates homosexuality is sinful, these individualstranslate these beliefs into actions, or prejudice, against gays and lesbians.A religious group’s beliefs about the nature of homosexuality, whether being gay or lesbian is a choice, a biological trait, or caused by the social environment, has a tremendous effect on prejudice towards this population (Whitley 2009). The belief that a person chooses their sexuality, which is promoted by some Christian churches, is highly correlated with anti-gay beliefs and attitudes. If a person or group believes a behavior perceived to be deviant could be controlled, they hold more negative attitudes towards people who engage in that behavior (Whitley 2009). Lastly, if Christians perceive gays and lesbians to be a threat to American and/orreligious values, which many evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics do, this perceived threat increases negative attitudes (McVeigh and Diaz 2009). For example, conservative Christians generally view same-sex marriage as a threat to their religious 19                        beliefs about what a marriage is supposed to be. Conservative Catholics, specifically those who continue to uphold the authority of the Church on social issues, view those acting on homosexual desires to be in conflict with the Church’s teachings as the Vatican continues to disapprove of individuals who act on homosexual desires. As of 2011, the majority (52 percent) of Catholics continued to agree with the bishops’ opposition to same-sex marriage (D’Antonio 2013).Many also feel same-sex marriage is a threat to American values, specifically what is often referred to as the “traditional” family. Based on the view men and women complement and even complete each other in marriage, conservative Christians often feelas if marriage between two partners of the same-sex threatens the entire foundation ofsociety, which they argue is the nuclear family. Seeing gays and lesbians as a threat toAmerican and religious values, which they hold in such high regards, can greatly increase their negative beliefs and attitudes toward this population.However, it is important not to lump all Christians into a single category on any issue (Smith 2000). Within the categories of evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, and Catholic there are varying degrees of discomfort and acceptance of homosexuality.Similarly, even within denominations or single congregations, beliefs and attitudes about this topic run the gamut (Manning 1999). In a study of mainline Protestant, evangelicalProtestant, and Catholic clergy, Cadge, Girouard, Olson, and Lylerohr (2012) find ambivalent beliefs about homosexuality, both in beliefs about gay and lesbian people and how homosexuality should be addressed to their specific congregations. Even within the Southern Baptist denomination (evangelical), which outsiders have labeled as being fully 20               intolerant of gays and lesbians, pastors indicate uncertainty about the topic (Cadge et al. 2012).Nonetheless, Adler (2012) suggests a more daunting picture, arguing the changing composition of Christian congregations will probably slow the rate of acceptance of gays and lesbians. As mainline Christian churches continue to decline, conservative Christian churches have witnessed growth (Adler 2012) or maintained size. Simultaneously, church-goers are becoming older and more politically conservative. To Adler (2012), these trends indicate the rate of change in attitudes towards gays and lesbians among Christians will slow. Overall, it is clear Christianity is directly linked to more prejudicial attitudes, specifically towards the gay and lesbian community. The question then becomes, why do Christians, specifically those with more conservative ideologies, hold more prejudicial beliefs and attitudes towards gays and lesbians than non-Christians or those with less conservative beliefs? More importantly, what can be done to reduce this level of prejudice? In order to address these questions, I explore how individuals form their identities within groups and how social contact across groups has the potential to reduce prejudice. As Pettigrew et al. (2011:278) explain, “cross-group contact is an essential, if insufficient, component for lasting remedies.”Subcultural identity theorySocial identity theory Before turning to social contact across groups, it is important to understand how individuals develop a coherent identity based on group membership. Social identity theory takes a macro approach by arguing a person’s identity is based on the social 21                     categories or groups they belong to, rather than the roles they occupy (Hogg, Terry, &White 1995; Stets & Burke 2000). According to this theory, a social group is made up of individuals who share a social identification and see themselves as part of a socialcategory. Based on these feelings of likeness with a social category, groups form a sense of ingroup membership and, thereby, recognize those who are different from the group as the outgroup (Hogg & Abrams 1988).Social identity theory, as explained by Hogg and Abrams (1988:7), proposes aperson’s identity is formed by their knowledge of the groups they belong to; “identity, specifically social identity, and group belongingness are inextricably linked in the sense that one’s conception or definition of who one is (one’s identity) is largely composed of self-descriptions in terms of the defining characteristics of social groups to which one belongs.” They stress belongingness to a group is psychological in nature and has important ramifications on how people evaluate themselves. Hogg and Abrams (1988) argue traditional social psychology has been reductionist in many ways by trying to explain group behavior in terms of the individuals rather than the whole. Out of a critique of this reductionist approach, Hogg and Abram (1988) construct social identity theory which holds society is make up of social categories that stand in relation to each other.Overall, social categories create social structure that precedes the individual.  Social identity theory is based on a cognitive process of categorization that has the ability to simplify perceptions, which is necessary for people to function withoutbeing overwhelmed (Hogg & Abram 1988). This theory purports categorization of people is almost always in reference to the self – “people tend to classify others on the basis oftheir similarities and differences to self; they constantly perceive others as members of 22                           the same category as self (ingroup members) or as members of a different category to self (outgroup members)” (Hogg & Abram 1988:21). Once an individual divides society into ingroups and outgroups social comparison can begin. Individuals then develop asubjective frame of reference – “the set of comparison others that are subjectively available to the individual in making a particular judgment” (Hogg & Abrams 1988:22).Social identity theory suggests all knowledge is gained by social comparisons. Peopleemphasize the differences between groups and hold their group’s views as better (Hogg & Abram 1988). It is through the processes of categorization and social comparison group behavior is created.Religion as an important social identityExamining religious identity provides a clear example of social identity theory.Smith et al.’s (1998) theory of subcultural identity plainly demonstrates how evangelicals use religion to form their social identity. This theory illustrates that evangelicals rely heavily on social comparisons between themselves and outgroups (mainline or liberal Protestants, Catholics, other religions, atheists, etc.) for the construction of their identity.Smith et al. (1998) argue evangelicals thrive because they distinguish themselves fromothers. Just as evangelicals compare themselves to other groups, mainline Protestants and Catholics compare themselves to evangelicals and others in order to form a coherent identity distinct from one another. However, as Smith et al. (1998) clearly show, evangelicals stress distinction far more than other Protestants and Catholics, which leads to a stronger, more salient religious identity for evangelicals. This is a circular process, asevangelical Protestants often already show signs of stronger religious identities by attending church more often, reading the Bible more frequently, and praying more than 23                          other Christians (Pew Forum 2008). It is difficult to determine which comes first, but it is clear the salience of their religious identity is reinforced through the process of distinction from other outgroups in society. Without the formation of ingroups and outgroups, group identity would not be meaningful. Social identity theory is important when considering Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward gays and lesbians, because gays and lesbians form an outgroup which many Christians, specifically evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics, set themselves in opposition to in order to create their identity.Emerson and Woo (2006) argue social ties between individuals – interpersonal relationships – provide a fundamental way of understanding groups and society at large.Specifically, Emerson (2006) explains social ties are essential for forming social capital.According to Coleman (1988:98), social capital is a resource that “inheres in the structure of relations between actors and among actors.” This type of capital differs from other types of capital because “it is not lodged either in the actors themselves or in physical implements of production” (Coleman 1988:98). Social capital is about whom you know, not what you know. It is gained through relationships with others and can be increased or decreased through a person’s position in society. To illustrate how individuals with greater resources in turn compile larger amounts of social capital, Coleman (1988)explains social capital through the metaphor of a credit slip. If A does a favor for B, then they expect a favor in return, thus individuals with more resources are able to build moresocial capital than those with less resources.Putnam (2000) argues there are two types of social capital: bonding and bridging.Bonding social capital occurs within groups. Specifically it “comes from the micro-bonds 24                    between individuals within already well-established groups” (Putnam 2000; Emerson & Woo 2006:93). On the other hand, bridging capital entails the bonds between people across various groups. There is “an inherent dilemma in attempting to foster these two types of social capital – developing one curtails developing the other” (Emerson & Woo 2006:93). As the social identity literature shows, bonding capital is often associated with increases in prejudice because one must favor their ingroup over other outgroups (Hogg & Abrams 1988; Emerson & Woo 2006). The negative effects of bonding capital on bridging capital can most clearly be seen within the subculture of American evangelicalism.In the landmark book American Evangelicalism, Smith et al. (1998) argue for a new theoretical model for understanding evangelicalism. This model suggests evangelicalism “is strong not because it is shielded against, but because it is – or at least perceives itself to be – embattled with forces that seem to oppose or threaten it” (Smith et al. 1998:89). Smith et al. (1998:89) argue American evangelicalism “thrives on distinction, engagement, tension, conflict, and threat.” The authors use subculturalidentity theory to explain the religious persistence and strength of American evangelicalism. Specifically, Smith et al. (1998:118) argue “religion survives and can thrive in pluralistic, modern society by embedding itself in subcultures that offer satisfying morally orienting collective identities which provide adherents meaning and belonging.” They continue by explaining, “in a pluralistic society, those religious groups will be relatively stronger which better possess and employ the cultural tools needed to create both clear distinction from and significant engagement and tension with other 25                       relevant outgroups, short of becoming genuinely countercultural” (Smith et al. 1998:118-119).Smith et al. (1998) also suggest subcultural identity theory can explain the strength of other Protestant groups including fundamentalists, mainlines, and liberals.Smith et al. (1998) argue fundamentalism fails to gather the strength of evangelicalismdue to its tendency toward defensive separatism. He calls this distinction-without-engagement because it reduces the group’s engagement with the broader society.Mainline and liberal Protestants face the opposite problem according to Smith et al. (1998). Mainline and liberal Protestants use an engagement-without-distinction strategy which appears to be even less adequate than the fundamentalists’ strategy. Through nearly complete accommodation to mainstream society, mainline and liberal Protestants lose a strong sense of Christian distinctiveness. Although Smith et al. (1998) focus exclusively on Protestant groups; I argue this theory can be expanded to include Catholics. Konieczny (2013) shows, unlike evangelicals’ engagement with the broader society, conservative Catholics’ engagement appears to be more contextual and focused on distinction from Catholics at large. Themembers of the conservative church in Konieczny’s (2013:9) case study work hard to “construct identity boundaries against other Catholics in ways that are strongly emotional.” She finds extreme polarization on social issues “even in a church that hashistorically tolerated pluralism and where the impulse is to remain unified rather than toseparate” (Konieczny 2013:9). On the other hand, liberal Catholics appear to face the same dilemma as mainline and liberal Protestants – that is, through near complete accommodation to mainstream society they lose a sense of distinctiveness. In sum, rather26                         than creating subcultural identity boundaries with the rest of society as evangelicals do, conservative Catholics are more concerned with distinguishing themselves from othermore liberal Catholics who they feel have undermined the authority of the Church.Conservative Catholics feel the Catholic faith is being threatened by overly individualistic Catholics who argue they no longer need the Church to make moral decisions, especially those concerning human sexuality (Konieczny 2013). Granted, the issues that set conservative Catholics apart from liberal Catholics are issues that set themapart from society at large. Issues such as homosexuality and abortion align conservative Catholic politics with evangelical Protestants. However, unlike evangelical Protestants, Catholics are less concerned with what society as a whole believes and are moreconcerned with other Catholics’ beliefs.Based on subcultural identity theory (Smith et al. 1998), strictness alone is not the cause of religious strength but a consequence of some religions’ engagement and tension with outgroups. According to Smith et al. (1998), it is only evangelicals who create an ideal subcultural identity through distinction-with-engagement. I suggest conservative Catholics do not gain the same benefits from distinction-with-engagement as evangelicalsbecause they primarily engage other Catholics. Therefore, it is only for evangelical Protestants, whose strength lies in distinction from society at large, that when one boundary weakens it must be reinforced or a new boundary must be formed in order for their religion to thrive. In this study, I argue as gender boundaries weaken, sexuality is being used to bolster and reinforce conservative Christians’ beliefs and ideology about gender. Consequently, in order to understand the importance of conservative Christians’27             opposition to homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, we must first examine the changing meaning of gender within conservative Christianity.The effects of gender ideology on beliefs about homosexualityGender ideology is a major contributing factor to the condemnation ofhomosexuality within conservative Christianity, both evangelical Protestantism and conservative Catholicism (Gallagher 2004; Konieczny 2013). Individuals who hold strong beliefs in traditional gender roles and family structures (i.e. malebreadwinner/female homemaker) are less accepting of breaks in gender specific behavior and expected sexual behavior (Bartkowski 2001; Hinrichs and Rosenberg 2002; McVeigh and Diaz 2009; Baunach et al. 2010). Since evangelical communities are far more likely than the general American population to stress the importance of traditional gender rolesand family structure, these communities are also more opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption and gay and lesbian civil rights generally. Heterosexual families who hold rigid gender expectations remain the ideal within the evangelical Christian community (Gallagher 2004; McQueeny 2009). Consider the continued ideal of wifely submission within evangelical Protestant households (Griffith 1997; Brasher 1998; Gallagher & Smith 1999; Bartkowski 2001).Hankins (2008:119) explains, “the ideal undergirding the Southern Baptist submission statement… known as the complementarian view… [is] the idea that men and women areinherently different by nature and have different roles in families, churches, and societies.” In short, men and women are thought to complement each other so that after marriage they become whole. Supporters of a complementarian view, typically evangelicals, argue men and women are created equal but different based on gender and 28                “God ordains the distinctions between the roles of men and women” (Hankins 2008:120).This rigid ideology that remains the dominant ideal within conservative Christian communities excludes gays and lesbians from an image of a healthy family (Manning1999; Gallagher 2003). The only way for a person to become whole, according to this conservative view, is to marry someone of the opposite sex. By marrying someone of the same sex, one role will go unfulfilled and, therefore, the family will not be healthy and as God intended. Conservative Catholics who are opposed to same-sex marriage base these views on the historical teachings of the Catholic Church in regards to gender and sexuality.Conservative American Catholics, especially pre-Vatican II Catholics, adhered closely to the Church’s call for intimacy to be within marriage and for the purposes of reproduction (Konieczny 2013). In addition, like evangelicals, contemporary marriage within Catholicism is based in Catholics’ understanding of “how particular gender roles and relations in marriage have been religiously supported historically” (Konieczny 2013:105). Just as we see a divide between evangelical and mainline Protestants over the issue ofmarriage and family, Konieczny (2013) finds a similar division between conservative and progressive Catholics. Using a case study, Konieczny (2013) demonstrates how at the more conservative Catholic Church authority relations to the Church and beliefs about gender roles are intertwined with the Church’s teachings about contraception and together these influence how families are formed and what constitutes family. On the other hand, at the more liberal Catholic Church, the emphasis is on egalitarian family relations and they have various responses to the authority of Church teachings, specifically when it comes to marriage and family.29              Reinforcing the gender boundary with sexualityGender ideology has long been a critical boundary for evangelicals, who consistently support more traditional gender norms than mainline Protestants orAmericans more generally and are keenly aware of this difference (Griffith 1997; Brasher 1998; Gallagher & Smith 1999; Bartkowski 2001; Gallagher 2003). In fact, evangelicalsoften blame various social problems on weakened gender boundaries and promote traditional gender roles and family structures as a panacea for these problems (Bartkowski 2004; Schreiber 2008; Kelly 2012). Over the past two decades, however, scholars have uncovered an increasingly egalitarian model of gender and family within conservative Christianity, even as rhetoric has remained largely constant (Griffith 1997; Brasher 1998; Gallagher & Smith 1999; Bartkowski 2001; Gallagher 2003). The shift from “pure” wifely submission and husband headship to a growing acceptance of mutual submission (Griffith 1997; Brasher 1998; Manning 1999; Bartkowski 2001; Bartkowski & Read 2003) has slowly weakened the subcultural identity boundary of gender. Even men and women who continue to rhetorically support pure wifely submission and husband headship within families fall short of this standard in practice. The growing necessity for women to work outside of the home and the push for men to be moreinvolved fathers and husbands has led to remarkable changes in gender relations within the family (Bartkowski 2001, 2004).Gallagher and Smith (1999:217) find while the vast majority of evangelical respondents agree with traditional views of gender and family, over 90 percent combine egalitarian and traditional ideas while continuing to emphasize male headship “as a core family value.” They find most evangelicals view women’s employment as necessary and 30                  do not view joint decision making as conflicting with the ideology of male headship -“support for symbolic male leadership is exchanged for practical reciprocity in addition to mutual respect” (Gallagher and Smith 1999:225). Overall, Gallagher and Smith (1999) conclude symbolic traditionalism and pragmatic egalitarianism best describes how traditional values have been internalized by both men and women, but are increasinglydifficult to obtain. The continuance of symbolic ideals enables men to deal with the loss of ability to be the primary breadwinner and women to feel like “good wives.” On the other hand, pragmatic egalitarianism enables the family to function within a changing society that encourages women to join the formal workforce and generally necessitates it for financial reasons. As American society moves towards gender equality, evangelicals continue to hold onto the ideals of male headship and wifely submission as boundary markers fromsociety at large. Their stance against feminist efforts to bring about gender equality in society (Schreiber 2008) and continuance of traditional gender ideologies in spite of theirrationality in society today (Gallagher and Smith 1999) indicate gender is a symbol for something deeper and more important than a surface level analysis suggests. Traditional gender ideologies separate conservative Christians from the broader society at large, and specifically from their more liberal counterparts – mainline Protestants and liberalCatholics.As conservative gender ideology becomes less and less practical, conservative Christians are attempting to reinforce the gender boundary by focusing on sexuality.Although gender and sexuality differ, they are strongly related concepts, especially within conservative Christianity. The new focus on sexuality as a boundary between 31                conservative Christians and society at large appears to be an attempt to maintain elements of traditional gender ideology, while simultaneously letting go of those elements that are impossible to live out. This trend is most evident among evangelical Protestants.Although the majority of evangelicals continue to support the idea of wifely submission (Griffith 1997; Brasher 1998; Gallagher & Smith 1999; Bartkowski 2001; Wellman 2008), this subcultural identity boundary has been substantially weakened by changinggender relations in the larger culture and the shift among many evangelical Protestants to an idea of mutual submission that makes them less susceptible to critiques of sexism and chauvinism from the larger society. Therefore, in the midst of this weakening boundarymarker, especially for evangelical Protestants, I argue beliefs about homosexuality have in many ways reinforced the strong gender boundary.The story is slightly different for Catholics, because the Catholic Church has historically used sexuality as a boundary marker from society (D’Antonio et al. 2013; Konieczny 2013). While evangelical Protestants focused on wifely submission and maleheadship, Catholics stressed the importance of sexuality issues such as birth control and abortion with the focus on reproduction. However, even as the Catholic Church continues to take an official stance against homosexual relations, individual Catholic attitudes have shifted closely with the larger society. For example, D’Antonio et al. (2013) find in 1987 only 20 percent of Pre-Vatican II Catholics (born in 1940 or earlier) surveyed indicated the moral authority on homosexual behavior should rest with the individual. By 2011, fully half of Pre-Vatican II Catholics answered moral authority on homosexual behavior was fully an individuals’ decision. Overall, between 2005 and 2011 D’Antonio et al. (2013:79) find an 11 percent increase in the proportion of Catholics who “assert the 32                moral primacy of the individual in decisions about same-sex relations.” In addition, Catholics are more likely than other religiously affiliated Americans to support same-sex marriage (D’Antonio et al. 2013). Therefore, homosexuality is not a new boundary within the Catholic Church – it is a component of a continuing boundary of human sexuality which conservative Catholics use to set themselves apart from more liberal Catholics.By drawing a hard line against homosexuality within evangelical Protestantismand conservative Catholicism, while mainline Protestants and liberal Catholics provide a more accepting stance on this issue, conservative Christians have successfully protected their subcultural identity from assimilation with the larger society. Wellman (2008:175) explains within evangelicalism today, gender is being downplayed – gender is no longer “the burning issue.” What evangelicals do emphasize, and see as key issues today, are their opposition to gay marriage and the “normalization” of homosexuality (Wellman 2008:175). While in the past upholding traditional gender roles, such as women raising children and obeying the authority of their husbands, was seen as a critical issue for evangelical Protestants, today this has shifted to gay and lesbian civil rights because “intheir minds it undermines their values, the teachings of scripture as they interpret them, and the strength of the family” (Wellman 2008:175).Similarly, conservative Catholics use the issue of homosexuality to distinguish themselves from liberal Catholics who have become more individualistic in their faith and less likely to uphold the moral authority of the Church when it comes to making decisions about sexuality (Konieczny 2013). Therefore, as mainline Protestants, liberal Catholics, and Americans at large become more accepting of gays and lesbians, conservative Christians are able to keep their embattled status outside of the mainstream33                     by opposing rights for this population. With an understanding of how social identity forms and how conservative Christians use this identity to distinguish themselves fromothers, I now turn to the literature on social contact to determine how ingroups and outgroups interact and the effects of these interactions.Social contact theory Research from the mid-1990s to present consistently finds social contact with gays and lesbians, particularly having a gay or lesbian friend, reduces heterosexuals’negative beliefs and attitudes towards this population (Herek and Capitanio 1996; Bowen and Bourgeois 2001; Hinrichs and Rosenberg 2002; Finlay and Walther 2003; Hodson etal. 2009; Barth and Parry 2009; Baunach et al. 2010; Lewis 2011; Bramlett 2012). This is important because gay and lesbian activists continue to argue coming out to friends and family will have positive political impacts for gay and lesbian civil rights (Lewis 2011).Beginning in the mid-1950s, social contact theory became an influential theory to explain how intergroup relationships can be improved. Allport’s contact hypothesis, introduced in The Nature of Prejudice (Allport 1954), has become the most influential theory of understanding relationships between groups (Pettigrew 1998; Wittig & Grant-Thompson 1998). The contact hypothesis suggests contact between individuals in different groups has the potential to encourage more accurate and positive beliefs and attitudes towards that group (Allport 1954). Allport (1954) indicates there are four essential features which lead to the positive effects of social contact with outgroups.These features include: equal status between individuals in the groups, common goals, cooperation between groups, and support of authorities, laws, and customs. More accurate beliefs and attitudes toward outgroups can lead to more positive relationships 34                   between groups. By exposing negative stereotypes as false and providing a more nuanced understanding of the group the individual represents, social contact can lead to improved relations between groups. Therefore, many scholars have studied the effects of social contact as a potential factor that can reduce prejudice (Allport 1954; Pettigrew 1998; Wittig and Grant-Thompson 1998; Hodson, Harry, and Mitchell 2009; Baunach, Burgess, and Muse 2010; Tavares 2011).Allport examines optimal conditions under which contact improves relations between in and outgroups, but does not systematically explore the processes through which contact actually changes attitudes and behaviors (Pettigrew 1998). More recentsocial contact research lays out four connected processes that lead social contact to change attitudes: learning about the outgroup, changing behavior, generating affective ties, and ingroup reappraisals (Pettigrew 1998). The initial mediating process, according to Pettigrew (1998), is learning about the outgroup through social contact. This learning process helps to correct negative stereotypes about that group and, in turn, reduce prejudice. However, some research has shown stereotypes are only disconfirmed undercertain circumstances, which limits the applicability of social contact theory. Pettigrew (1998) argues although the ideal circumstances are not always present, there are othermediating factors that also improve the ability of contact to overcome prejudice. The second mediating process, according to Pettigrew (1998:71), is “optimal intergroup contact acts as a benign form of behavior modification.” Put simply, as people interact with outgroups they are forced to change their behaviors in those situations which leads to changes in attitudes. This is especially true when there is repeated contact with outgroup members. The third factor that leads to changes in attitudes and behaviors is 35               affective ties. Continued contact with an outgroup can reduce anxiety and increase positive emotions. For example, empathy can help to improve attitudes towards an entire outgroup (Pettigrew 1998; Pettigrew et al. 2011). Finally, social contact with an outgroup can lead to reappraisal of the ingroup. By having social contact with an outgroup, ingroups begin to broaden their worldview. Another way this works is increased outgroup contact may mean less ingroup contact, this allows individuals to reexamine their views and beliefs separately from their own group.  Social contact also has the ability to be generalized from one individual to an entire group through three processes of generalization (Pettigrew 1998). First, individualswho have contact with an outgroup member may generalize that positive contact to othersituations with that individual. Second, positive social contact with an outgroup member can be generalized to the entire outgroup. Lastly, improved attitudes towards an immediate outgroup can be generalized to other outgroups (Pettigrew 1997, 1998, 2009).In a meta-analysis of 696 samples, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) find an inverse relationship between social contact and prejudice for 94 percent of the samples. Although previous social contact research has labeled Allport’s optimal conditions essential, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) argue these conditions indeed facilitate prejudice reduction, but are not vital. While contact situations that meet the optimal conditions of contact “achieved a markedly higher mean effect size”, these conditions “should not be regarded as necessary for producing positive contact outcomes” (Pettigrew & Tropp 2006:766).Additionally, this research shows the effect of social contact between groups is regularly generalized to other group members beyond the immediate contact (Pettigrew & Tropp 2006). This means not only is prejudice toward the individual reduced, it also extends to 36                    the entire outgroup, outgroup members in other situations, and even sometimes to other outgroups not involved in the contact. This critical finding indicates social contact withoutgroups members has the potential to reduce prejudice across groups, not just with a particular person. Based on these findings, we can predict if a conservative Christian (either an evangelical Protestant or a conservative Catholic) has a gay brother, for example, this contact will reduce the conservative Christian’s prejudice toward gays and lesbians in general and potentially even other outgroups.Initial studies of social contact theory focused primarily on race; however, recent research has begun to expand to other intergroup relations, specifically the gay and lesbian population. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) argue this application of the theory to new empirical topics is justified and suggest social contact theory may now be applied as a general social psychological theory. They suggest the research is conclusive, contact generally reduces prejudice and this effect occurs across various types of groups, not just racial or ethnic groups (Pettigrew & Tropp 2006).My friend is gay, but…Two decades of research on the effects of social contact with gays and lesbians have produced varied results. Lewis (2011:235) finds “even controlling for many factorsthat might influence both support for LGB [lesbian, gay, bisexual] rights and probability of having LGB friends, knowing a lesbian or gay man has a noticeable impact on supportfor gay rights.” Interestingly, Lewis (2011) goes on to explain although the effects are weaker, this relationship even holds for political conservatives and evangelicalProtestants. However, in a study of the influence of contact with gays and lesbians on religious American’s opinion of same-sex marriage, Bramlett (2012) finds social contact 37                 does not have a positive effect for white Protestants. Bramlett’s (2012:30) study suggests having a gay friend or family member increases the likelihood of supporting same-sex marriage among individuals with unaffiliated religious traditions, Latino Catholics, black Protestants, and to a lesser degree white Catholics. However, she finds no positive impacts of social contact on either white mainline Protestants or white evangelical Protestants. Similarly, Baker and Brauner-Otto (2014) find the positive influences of social contact are smaller among evangelicals with gay or lesbian friends than society at large. This study shows evangelicals with gay or lesbian friends are only half as likely as non-evangelicals to believe homosexuality is morally acceptable and social contact has no effect on beliefs about the origins of homosexuality for evangelicals (Baker and Brauner-Otto 2014).Research on race has also provided support of the argument that social contact may not be enough to overcome negative beliefs and attitudes for some subgroups. For example, Hughey (2012) finds social contact with minority races is often insufficient inovercoming negative beliefs about race, especially for white nationalists. Despite social contact, white nationalists, and to some extent white anti-racist group members, continue to hold stereotypical beliefs about members of minority races.This project seeks to expand social contact theory by focusing on “the negative features that deter intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice” (Pettigrew & Tropp 2006). As Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) explain, previous research has primarily focused on specifying the positive features that reduce prejudice; however, the vast body of research on social contact has ignored factors that cause social contact to be ineffective.Similarly, Hodson, Harry, and Mitchell (2009:510) explain “explicit consideration of38                     individual differences in the contact literature has been minimal, leaving relatively unaddressed the issue of intergroup attitudes among prejudice-prone individuals who report outgroup encounters.” If there are negative features that render social contact less effective, previous literature may “have underestimated contact effects, particularly among people most in need of prejudice interventions, those higher in prejudice”(Hodson, Harry, & Mitchell 2009:509). For that reason, I attempt to determine whatfactor(s) render social contact ineffective (or at least less effective) among evangelical Christians and conservative Catholics.I propose one possible negative factor that deters prejudice reduction for this population is subcultural identity. My argument is since conservative Christians are using anti-homosexuality as a subcultural identity boundary to separate themselves fromsociety, having social contact with gays and lesbians will not produce the same positive effects as it does with the rest of the population. Opposition to homosexuality is such an integral part of their religious identity, which is highly salient among these populations, even having a close friend or family member who is gay or lesbian will not change beliefs and attitudes about homosexuality (or at least not to the same degree). I argue when balancing the importance of these personal relationships with their religiousidentity, adherence to strict Biblical literalism for evangelical Protestants or Church authority for conservative Catholics will outweigh the positive effects of social contact with gays and lesbians.Effects of social contact within a conservative Christian subcultureIn an ethnographic study of faith-based poverty relief, Bartkowski and Regis (2003:17) clearly explain the difficulties of balancing two “countervailing ethical 39                  imperatives.” Bartkowski and Regis (2003:16) argue, “Religious narratives of congregational benevolence are replete with the motifs of judgment and compassion which, when woven together in distinctive ways, produce variegated religious conceptualizations of social and economic justice.” The moral imperative of judgment within Christianity is based on social distinctions constructed through boundaries, i.e. subcultural identity. In contrast to the distinctions set through judgment, compassion is based on principles of equality and mutuality (Bartkowski & Regis 2003).When considering beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, the same balancing of judgment and compassion is present. Where compassion for gay and lesbian friends and family members may lead mainline Protestants and liberal Catholics to accept gay and lesbian civil rights, the need for distinctive identities and boundary work may lead evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics to draw the line at gay and lesbian civil rights. Therefore, social contact continues to play an important role for Christians who weigh the moral imperative of compassion over judgment, but for those Christians who thrive on an embattled identity (Smith et al. 1998), outgroup labeling and condemnation often outweighs compassion in the battle for morality.ConclusionOverall, I attempt to determine if social contact with gays and lesbians has positive effects among Mississippi Christians. Given what previous literature says, I aminterested in determining if social contact has the same effects in this specific contextand, if not, what factors lead social contact to have weaker or no effect among Southern Christians. I expect social contact will be less beneficial in the South than previous40                            research suggests due to the more conservative nature of religion and the high correlation between conservative religious ideology and prejudice towards gays and lesbians.Additionally, this research adds to the current conversation surrounding religion and prejudice by expanding the sample to include Catholics. This allows the study to go further by determining if it is Christianity in the South or only Southern Protestantismthat negates the positive effects of social contact.Despite the importance of social contact for improving intergroup relations, Isuggest social contact may not be adequate across all subgroups of the population. In line with Hodson, Harry, and Mitchell (2009:509), I expect “increased contact may fail to reduce prejudice among highly prejudiced persons.” Specifically, I predict the positiveeffects of social contact will not be strong enough to counter evangelical Christians’ or conservative Catholics’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality.An understanding of the importance of subcultural identity boundaries for conservative Christians greatly expands our ability to explain why social contact with gays and lesbians may not have the same positive effects on this population. I anticipatewhile social contact with gays and lesbians may have the potential to overcome negative stereotypes and attitudes toward homosexuality for mainline Protestants and liberalCatholics, it will fail to counteract the importance of maintaining a subcultural identity for evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. I predict the ineffectiveness of social contact theory when addressing conservative Christians’ views of gays and lesbians is related to the boundary work conservative Christians engage in when trying to balance judgment and compassion. With these predictions in mind, I now turn to ChapterIII, which explains my methodological approach for answering these questions.41            CHAPTER IIIDATA & METHODSUnderstanding how social contact mediates beliefs about homosexuality and attitudes towards gay and lesbian civil rights among Mississippi Christians calls for amixed methods study. For this study I rely on both mail surveys and in-depth interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of how Christians’ views are affected by social contact with a minority population. The surveys provide a broader understanding of how religion, social contact, and support for gay and lesbian civil rights interact for Mississippi Christians. Respondents for the interviews included a subset of survey respondents. Interviews provide the opportunity to speak directly with MississippiChristians to have them to expand on their answers, which provides more detailed information about the ambivalence and contradictions that occur when they attempt to make sense of their personal relationships with gays and lesbians and a faith that is not always accepting of homosexuality.Mississippi: A conservative Christian mecca Mississippi provides fertile ground for studying conservative Christianity. I begin this chapter by providing justification for choosing Mississippi as a research location for this study. Mississippi is an ideal location to conduct a study about the interactions of religion and support for gay and lesbian civil rights because of the religious and political42                   conservatism of the state, as well as the state’s lack of supportive policies and legal protections for the gay and lesbian community. Understanding Mississippi Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian civil rights expands the existing literature and demonstrates the relevance of these issues in the South at large.As a whole, 78.4 percent of American adults identify as Christian (Pew Forum2008). Of those who identify as Christian, 26.3 percent belong to an evangelical Protestant church, 18.1 percent belong to a mainline Protestant church, and 23.9 percent belong to a Catholic church (Pew Forum 2008). However, when we turn our attention to the Southern region of the United States we see the number of evangelical Protestants riseconsiderably. According to the Pew Forum (2008), 83 percent of adults who reside in the Southern United States identify as Christian and the number who identify as evangelical Protestant is far greater than any other area of the country. While 37 percent of Americans in the South identify as evangelical Protestant, only 13 percent of those in the Northeast, 26 percent in the Midwest, and 20 percent in the West identify this way (Pew Forum 2008). Additionally, survey results show 17 percent of Southerners identify as mainline Protestant and 16 percent identify as Catholic (Pew Forum 2008).When specifically considering Mississippi, we see these numbers become even more concentrated within evangelical Protestantism. According to The Pew Forum onReligion & Public Life’s (2008) “U.S. Religious Landscape Survey,” 47 percent of Mississippians identify as evangelical Protestants as opposed to only 26 percent nationwide. At the same time, only 11 percent of Mississippians identify as mainline Protestants and nine percent identify as Catholic (Pew Forum 2008). A recent Pew Research Report (Pew Forum 2014), “Changing Attitudes on Gay Marriage,” shows 43              white evangelicals’ support for gay marriage remains lowest of all other religioustraditions at only a 23 percent support rate as compared to Catholics at 59 percent and white mainline Protestants at 62 percent.In addition to the conservative religious nature of the South, a largely due to this conservatism, the South is also a context where gay and lesbian experiences have been marginalized. Previous research on gay culture and life has all too often focused only on larger, urban areas outside of the South (Howard 1999; Johnson 2008). Through studies of queer Southerners, Howard (1999) and Johnson (2008) challenge the idea of the gay culture is restricted to urban areas or does not exist in the South. Both scholars provide compelling evidence for why researchers would be remiss to limit studies of gay culture to a specific context, and the need to expand our understanding about gay and lesbian experiences by considering other components such as rural life, religion, and race. The goal of this project is to provide a more in-depth understanding of how religion and social contact with gays and lesbians impacts beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian rights in the South. I attempt to illuminate the unique circumstances gays and lesbians encounter in a location that is often understudied. The media frames the South, and specifically Mississippi, as a single-minded location where conservative Christianity reigns and gay and lesbian rights is a non-issue because it is already settled in favor of few rights (Howard 1999). However, recent events in Mississippi show this is not the case. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) opened astate office in Mississippi in 2014 to advocate for gay and lesbian equality across the state. The presence of the HRC in a Southern state indicates that gays and lesbians in the South are no longer being ignored and rendered invisible. On October 20, 2014 two 44                   same-sex couples filed the first federal challenge the same-sex marriage ban in Mississippi. Additionally, Mississippi is one of six states with an anti-marriage constitutional amendment that has been ruled unconstitutional, but is currently pending further action (Freedom to Marry 2014b). The high correlation between evangelical religion and increased prejudice towards gays and lesbians makes Mississippi a keybattleground for gay and lesbian rights and an exemplar for the study of social contact and support of this population.In sum, the combination of conservative religion and the move for gay and lesbian civil rights within the state of Mississippi make it an ideal location for this study. As Mississippi moves toward equality for gay and lesbian citizens, it is important to understand the barriers to gay and lesbian rights. The high correlation between religion and prejudice, especially toward gay and lesbian individuals, means the South and Mississippi in particular, is an excellent context to explore the importance of social contact in bringing about gay and lesbian civil rights.Data To gather my sample of Mississippi Christians, I contacted pastors and priests to ask for permission to recruit members of their congregations for my study. The initial sample of churches was gathered by taking a systematic sample of all Mississippi Christian churches. Using ListGrabber Standard 2012 (a software program that captures contact lists from online directories and enters them into an Excel spreadsheet), I compiled a comprehensive list of all Mississippi Christian churches listed on YellowPages.com (an online telephone and address directory of businesses) and conducted systematic sampling of the list after narrowing it down to only Protestant 45              churches in Mississippi. In this first sample, I contacted only Protestant churches with the intention of gathering an equal sample of evangelical and mainline churches. The total population of Protestant churches in Mississippi with valid addresses on YellowPages.com was 6,329. I used Excel random number generator to order the churches. For each church selected by the random number generator, I then reviewed thewebsites and information about the churches, in order of their randomly generated identification number, until I had a sample of 22 evangelical Protestant churches and 22 mainline Protestant churches. In addition to the 44 sampled churches, I oversampled mega-churches in Mississippi (4 evangelical mega-churches and 1 mainline mega-church) using the Hartford Institute for Religion Research (2012) list of mega-churches in Mississippi. This provided me with an initial sample of 49 churches. I classified churches as evangelical Protestant if their website indicates they adhere to a literal interpretation of the Bible, the church self-identifies as evangelical, suggests Jesus was the only way tosalvation, or fall within a strictly evangelical denomination. Churches with websites indicating they are open to all people, follow a non-literal interpretation of the Bible, or who fall into a mainline denomination were classified as mainline Protestant. Of the 49 churches I initially contacted to request participation, only three churches agreed to participate in the study. This is telling of the climate in Mississippi when addressing the issue of religion and homosexuality. The majority of churches (approximately 84 percent)failed to respond, even after sending follow up letters. Five churches declined to participate; one of which sent a note that stated they are a very small church which currently does not have a pastor and they “try to go strictly by what the Bible tells us – please mark our church off your list.”46                 Due to the low response rate to my systematic sample, I relied upon snowballsampling to increase my sample size. The three pastors who originally responded were asked if they could recommend other churches that may be willing to participate. Fromthe snowball sampling process, I was able to locate an additional 10 Mississippi churches willing to participate in the study for a total of 13 churches. When I added the name of the pastor who recommended I contact the church to the recruitment letter, responses to my letters increased.After gathering my sample, I contacted pastors/priests of the 13 churches and requested access to their church directory to draw a sample of congregation members.Some pastors/priests did not feel comfortable giving me contact information for theirmembers and opted to distribute the surveys themselves. Of the 13 churches that agreedto participate, six sent directories from which I drew a systematic sample of congregation members to survey. I selected the first participant at random then sampled every kth member from the directory. I sent the remaining seven churches a package of 30 surveys to distribute to congregation members of the pastor’s or priest’s choosing. The churches in the sample consist of one Non-denominational Protestant church, one Lutheran church, seven United Methodist churches, three Catholic churches, one Baptist church, and one Episcopalian church. Protestant churches are divided between evangelical and mainline based on The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life’s (2008) classification of Protestant denominations in the “U.S. Religious Landscape Survey.” The United Methodist churches and the Episcopalian church are coded mainline Protestant. The Non-denominational Protestant church, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist church are coded as evangelical Protestant.47                     Despite my initial efforts to gather a sample of Mississippi churches using an equal probability method, I found snowball sampling was the only feasible option for this project in Mississippi. Pastors, priests, and congregation members are reluctant to discuss these issues. Therefore, I had to rely on the rapport of other Mississippi pastors and priests in order to increase my sample size. Although the sample is not random or necessarily representative of the larger population of Mississippi Christians, I argue the variety of religious backgrounds allows me to gain a general understanding of MississippiChristians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights.Additionally, the sample was spread across the state and in both rural and urban areas.Finally, in a state known for conservative politics and religion, I argue if anything my sample will be less conservative than the general population (since they were willing to participate in this project), thus I am more likely to understate than overstate the strength of my findings. In a state where almost half of religiously affiliated individuals identity as evangelical Protestants (compared to only 26 percent nationally; Pew Forum 2008) I was unable to gather a representative sample of evangelical churches. Only three evangelicalchurches were willing to participate in this study.SurveysIn total, I mailed 163 surveys directly to congregation members and 240 for pastors/priests to distribute (403 surveys total) on April 29, 2013. A follow-up letter was sent to individuals on May 30, 2013, and a follow-up email was sent to the pastors/priest to distribute the surveys, as well as remind their congregations to return them. In order to increase my response rates, I attempted to reduce the costs to the respondents byproviding addressed, stamped return envelopes and offered an incentive. Respondents 48                   were informed in the letter requesting their participation that if they provided their contact information for a potential follow-up interview they would be entered into a drawing to win one of six $50 gift cards. I mailed the gift cards to six winners on July 12, 2013.I received a total of 144 surveys for my study; a response rate of approximately 36 percent. This response rate is lower than the average of approximately 50 percent for mail surveys that recent research has suggested (Shih & Fan 2007; Baruch & Holtom2008). Yet, it is not surprising considering mailed survey response rates are on the decline (Dey 1997; Sax, Gilmartin, Bryant 2003). Dey showed the average response rate for national mail surveys had decreased from about 60 percent in the 1960s to about 20 percent by 1997. Based on this finding, my results appear to fall within an acceptable response range. There are several factors that could have affected my response rate. First, it isclear no individuals from a number of churches (who previously agreed to participate)returned the surveys; therefore, these surveys were not distributed or the participants were not encouraged to complete them. (One church also informed me the surveys were never distributed which accounts for over seven percent of failed responses.) Anotherlimitation is that some of the addresses in the church directory were outdated (mail was returned and I was unable to find an updated address) and some of the congregation members had passed away or were unable to complete the survey due to health problems (this was noted on returned surveys by the respondents’ family member or caretaker) which again lowered my potential sample size. The number of letters returned to me for 49                        these reasons were fairly low, only about two percent, but I predict others simply threwthe letters out rather than returning them.The survey included questions in four categories: religious beliefs and practices, social contact, social beliefs and attitudes, and demographics (See Appendix A). The purpose was to gain an understanding of respondents’ religious beliefs and then to determine how these beliefs and the respondents’ demographic characteristics affect theirsocial contact with gays and lesbians and beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights.Quantitative Analysis Survey results are used to describe my sample and compare them to the broaderpopulation of Mississippians. Specifically, I use descriptive statistics from the 144 surveys to paint a picture of my larger sample and how this subset of the population of Mississippi Christians differ from the overall population of Christians living in the state.Then I examine how interview respondents are similar or different from the overall sample.For the purpose of this study, I classify respondents’ into one of three analytical categories: evangelical Protestant, liberal Protestant, and Catholic. Protestant respondents are classified as evangelical or mainline based on their denominational affiliation using The Pew Forums' (2008) classification system. Based on this classification system, the respondents who attend the non-denominational Protestant churches, Lutheran churches, and Baptist churches are considered evangelical. The respondents who attend the United Methodist churches, Episcopalian churches, and Presbyterian churches will be considered mainline. Catholics, on the other hand, do not divide into different denominations based on beliefs. As Konieczny (2013) indicates, Catholics make up a single denomination.50                Therefore, Catholic respondents are classified based on affiliation with a Catholic Church.Overall, 34.1 percent of survey respondents claimed religious affiliation with an evangelical Protestant church, 38.2 percent with a mainline Protestant church, and 22.9 percent with a Catholic church. Over half of respondents (60.4 percent) self-identified as religiously conservative. (Note: Of the 55 respondents who claimed religious affiliation at a mainline Protestant church, 30.9 percent classified themselves as religiously conservative.) More than 90 percent of the sample answered they know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Approximately 40 percent of the sample claimed to have a gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) family member and 70 percent indicated they had a GLBfriend. Over half of the sample (53.5%) of Mississippi Christians disagree gays and lesbians should have the right to marry. Only about 30 percent indicated gays and lesbians should have the right to marry and 15.3 percent said they neither agree nor disagree (See Table 1).Demographically the sample was predominately female (70.8%), white (86.8%), and married (78.5%). The Pew Forum (2008) indicates approximately 46 percent of Protestants are men and 54 percent are women. Within the Catholic Church the rates are the same - 46 percent of Catholics are men and 54 percent are women. In addition to women having higher rates of church membership than men, women are generally moreinvolved in church activities than men (Brasher 1998). These factors may help explainwhy the majority of respondents are women.While almost 90 percent of the sample identified as white, eight percent identified as black/African American, and a little over four percent identified themselves as another 51              race (one person identified as American Indian/Alaskan Native and five people identified as ‘other’ without indicating a specific race or ethnicity). The percentage of black/African American respondents is much lower than the percentage of black/African Americans living in Mississippi (37.4%; U.S. Census Bureau 2014). This discrepancy occurred because of the 13 churches that agreed to participate in the study only one was predominately black. Since religion continues to be a highly segregated institution in the United States (Emerson & Smith 2000; Emerson & Woo 2006) the percentages of blacks in other predominately white congregations were low or non-existent.The majority of the sample was married and approximately half of the sample had children less than 25 years of age. About 35 percent of respondents had a high school diploma or some college, 35 percent held a two or four year college degree, and the remaining 29 percent held a Masters, Doctoral, or Professional degree. Almost 70 percentof the sample was born in the South and 58 percent identify their political affiliations as conservative. The average age of the sample is 56.6 years old with a minimum age of 20 and a maximum age of 88. Only 11.8 percent indicated they were politically liberal and about a quarter of respondents identified as politically moderate.Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for each of the three religious categoriesunder analysis. I provide percentages for demographics, religious beliefs, amount of social contact with gays and lesbians, and beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights.52                                                                                                                              Table 1 Descriptive Statistics, Percentages by Religious CategoryVariables Evangelical Protestants (N=49)Mainline Protestants (N=55)Catholics (N=33)SexFemale 67.3 80.0 66.6Male 32.7 20.0 33.3Total 100.0 100.0 100.0EducationHS diploma/GED 16.3 3.6 6.1Some college 34.7 18.2 33.3Associate’s Degree 10.2 5.5 9.1Bachelor’s Degree 20.4 30.9 30.3Master’s Degree 16.3 30.9 15.2Doctoral/Professional Degree 2.0 10.9 6.1Total 100.0 100.0 100.0Marital StatusSingle, never married 6.1 7.3 0.0Married/partnered/cohabiting 81.6 72.7 84.8Separated/divorced/widowed 12.3 20.0 15.2Total 100.0 100.0 100.0RaceBlack/African American 2.0 18.2 0.0White 87.8 80.0 100.0Other 8.1 1.8 0.0Total 98.0 100.0 100.0Political AffiliationLiberal 2.0 23.6 3.0Moderate 10.2 38.2 24.2Conservative 81.6 32.7 72.7Other 6.1 5.5 0.0Total 100.0 100.0 100.053                                                                                                                  Table 1 (Continued)Knows someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual 81.6 90.9 97.0Yes 16.3 7.3 0.0NoTotal98.0 98.2 97.0Gay family memberYes 28.6 34.5 39.4No 53.1 56.4 57.6Total 81.6 90.9 97.0Gay friendYes 38.3 72.7 72.7No 40.8 18.2 24.2Total 79.6 90.9 97.0Allow same-sex marriageAgree 10.2 54.5 18.2Neither agree nor disagree 6.1 21.8 18.2Disagree 81.6 21.8 63.6Total 98.0 98.2 100.0Allow same-sex adoptionAgree 2.0 63.6 51.5Neither agree nor disagree 12.2 14.5 18.2Disagree 85.7 21.8 30.3Total 100.0 100.0 100.0The Bible is the infallible Word of God 95.9 54.6 84.8Agree 2.0 3.6 3.0Neither agree nor disagree 2.0 40.1 12.1DisagreeTotal100.0 98.2 100.0Table 1 shows clear differences between religious categories. Evangelical Protestants demonstrate the lowest percentage having any form of social contact with54                   gays and lesbians. However, the vast majority of all three religious categories indicatethey at least know someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual (81.6% of evangelical Protestants, 90.9% of mainline Protestants, and 97% of Catholics). Only 38.3 percent of evangelical Protestants claimed to have a gay, lesbian, or bisexual friend. This is compared to 72.7 percent of Catholics and mainline Protestants. While over half (54.5%)of mainline Protestants agreed same-sex couples should have the right to marry, only 18.2 percent of Catholics and 10.2 percent of evangelical Protestants agreed gays and lesbians should have the right to marry. In line with these statistics, 81.6 percent of evangelical Protestants and 72.7 percent of Catholics claim a conservative political affiliation compared to about a third of mainline Protestants (32.7%).InterviewsOf the 144 surveys completed, 60 participants provided contact information indicating their willingness to take part in an interview. Of the 60 respondents who provided contact information, 55 reported some type of social contact with gays and/or lesbians. From these 55, I initially selected 37 potential participants for face-to-face interviews based on degree of social contact with gay and lesbian family members and friends. Of the 37, I invited all respondents who provided contact information and had a gay or lesbian family member to participate in the interviews, as well as a group of respondents who had a friend who was gay or lesbian. I mailed the request letters on August 13, 2013 and potential respondents were asked to choose a location and date that best worked for them. Out of the 37 individuals invited to participate in face-to-face interviews, 19 individuals signed up by returning the sign-up sheet indicating the location and time most convenient for them. All 19 individuals who signed up for face-to-face 55              interviews completed the interviews. The interviews were conducted across the state at three different churches, on September 21st, September 28th, and November 2nd. Thelocations were chosen to allow the easiest access for the most respondents – there were locations across the state in south, central, and north Mississippi. The face-to-face interviews were conducted with everyone who signed up, not just the members of the particular churches who allowed me to use their facilities.After the face-to-face interviews, on November 6, 2013 I sent 30 lettersrequesting participants sign up for phone interviews. I sent these letters to the 18 individuals who did not sign up for face-to-face interviews from the original sample of 37 and to an additional 12 individuals. In total, 49 survey respondents were asked to participant in an interview. Between November 4th and December 10th, I completed 21 phone interviews, for a total of 40 interviews. As with the surveys, respondents were informed if they participated in the interview they would be entered into a drawing for one of six $50 gift cards. The gift cards were mailed to 6 winners on January 8, 2014.Interview respondents claimed membership at 12 different churches (note: some respondents indicated they attended a different congregation now, but continued to hold membership at one of the 13 churches in the original sample). Each respondent identified the denomination of the church they currently attend (or are a member of for the two respondents who no longer attend services). Although some respondents were now attending a different church, no respondents changed religious categories from the time of the survey to the time of the interview. Based on The Pew Forum’s (2008)classification of Protestant denominations, 25 percent of interview respondents attend evangelical Protestant churches and 47.5 percent attend mainline Protestant churches.56                       The remaining 27.5 percent of the interview respondents indicate they attend a Catholicchurch. Of the respondents, 70 percent are women. This figure is consistent with researchthat shows women are more involved in religious activities. Ten percent of the sample identify as black/African American while the remaining 90 percent identify as white/Caucasian. The average age of the sample is 51 years old, with a range of 23 to 75 years old. Approximately 67 percent of the sample is age 51 or older. According to the Pew Forum (2008), the age of the sample supports national statistics which indicatesreligious individuals, especially Protestants, are older than the general population. For example, over 51 percent of Protestants are age 50 or older compared to only about 40percent of the general population. Additionally, the Pew Forum (2008) reports while 25 percent of adults under the age of 30 are not affiliated with a specific religion, only eight percent of adults over the age of 70 are not affiliated with a religion.The interview schedule included questions about respondents’ religious beliefs and practices, social contact with gays and lesbians, and social beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian civil rights (see Appendix B). The interview process included asking respondents a set of open-ended questions, then after their initial response following those questions up with more specific questions. The goal was to determine the respondents’ overall religious beliefs and practices, how these beliefs translated into response to gay and lesbian civil rights, and how these effects were mediated (or not) by social contact with gays and lesbians. Specifically, I designed the interview schedule to gain a more detailed view of actual social contact with gays and lesbians. Moving beyond “Do you know someone who is gay or lesbian?” and “Do you have gay or lesbian friends?” this project attempts to understand the nature of those friendships and familial 57                         relationships with gays and lesbians. By having respondents explain the details of theirrelationships with gays and lesbians (“How and when did you meet?”, “How did you find out they were gay or lesbian?”, “How much time do you spend with this person now?”, “Did their sexuality have any effect on your relationship?”) allows this project to move beyond others which have studied social contact with gays and lesbians through singlevariables of social contact or friendship.Interview times ranged from approximately fifteen minutes to almost two hours in length. Typically those with more conservative views about sexuality took a much longertime explaining their beliefs and attitudes. Interviewees with who are most supportive ofgay and lesbian civil rights finished their interviews more quickly and generally spent far less time explaining their religious beliefs and attitudes. Each respondent signed an informed consent form and agreed to have the interviews recorded.Qualitative analysisInterviews are systematically analyzed with the use of qualitative data management software (MaxQDA). Each interview has been transcribed in full. The interviews are analyzed based on the existing theoretical arguments of social contact theory and subcultural identity theory using sensitizing concepts. I begin my qualitative analysis by using a number sensitizing concepts including: social contact with gays and lesbians, theological beliefs, beliefs about homosexuality, beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights. After coding survey responses into initial sensitizing concepts, I move to more nuanced axial coding. In addition, I pay close attention for emergent themes (themes that had not been anticipated). By coding each interview into these topics and themes, I uncover a broader picture about the unique experiences of Mississippi 58             Christians. These unique experiences and meanings are placed into the larger context of the surveys and the overall connection between Christianity and gay and lesbian civilrights.Additionally, I compared survey respondents who were interviewed and who were not interviewed to ensure there was no selection bias into interviews. I found thatsurvey respondents who were interviewed and those who were not were similar across religious and political beliefs. Although there may have been selection bias into surveys, interview respondents did not differ vastly from those survey respondents who were not interviewed. Table 2 provides sample characteristics for each of the 40 interview participants.59                                                                                                                                                                              Table 2 Interview Sample Characteristics 60 Kids ≤Marital Gay Gay # Denomination Sex Age Education 25 Status Race Friend Gay Family Marriage Non-Master’s Strongly 1 denominational Male n/a Degree Yes Married White Yes No disagree ProfessionalStrongly 2 Catholic Female 44 Degree Yes Married White Yes disagree Sibling, Cousin Non-Bachelor’s Strongly 3 denominational Female 60 Degree Yes Married White Yes disagree No Non-Master’s Strongly 4 denominational Male 61 Degree Yes Married White No disagree Yes Non-Master’s Niece/Nephew, Strongly 5 denominational Female 63 Degree Yes Divorced White Yes Cousin agree Non-Strongly 6 denominational Female 50 Some College Yes Divorced Yes Son disagree Black Bachelor’s Strongly 7 United Methodist Female 28 Degree Yes Single White Yes Cousin agree Strongly 8 United Methodist Female 23 Some College No Single White Yes Cousin agree Doctoral9 United Methodist Female 75 Degree Yes Black Yes No Neither Married Master’s Strongly 10 United Methodist Male 55 Degree Yes Married White Yes Cousin agree Master’s Strongly 11 United Methodist Female 32 Degree Married White Yes No agree No Master’s Strongly 12 Episcopalian Male 60 Degree Yes Married White Yes No agree Associates 13 Episcopalian Female 69 Degree Yes Divorced White Yes No Neither 14 Episcopalian Female 50 Yes Married White Yes No Neither Master’s Degree    Strongly  15 Catholic   Male  72 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  disagree  Professional Moderately  16 Catholic   Male  43  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree Bachelor’s Moderately  17 Catholic  Female   60  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  disagree Bachelor’s  18 Catholic  Female   63  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  Neither Master’s Moderately  19 Catholic  Female   52  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  Cousin  agree Bachelor’s Niece/Nephew, Moderately  20  Baptist Female   53  Degree  Yes  Married  White  No  Cousin  disagree Bachelor’s Strongly  21  Episcopalian Female   55  Degree  Yes  Divorced  White  Yes  Cousin  agree Bachelor’s Strongly  22  Episcopalian Female   39  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree  23  Episcopalian Female   45 Some College   No  Divorced  White  Yes  Aunt/Uncle  Neither Master’s Strongly  24  United Methodist  Male  55  Degree  No  Married  Black  Yes  Niece/Nephew  disagree Strongly  25  Episcopalian Female   70 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  Cousin  disagree Master’s  26 Catholic  Female   53  Degree  Yes  Married  White  No  Brother  Neither Bachelor’s Strongly  27  United Methodist Female   37  Degree  No  Single  White  Yes  No  agree  Strongly  28 Catholic  Female   36 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  Cousin  disagree Bachelor’s Strongly  29  Baptist Female   43  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  Step-brother  disagree Master’s Moderately  30 Catholic  Female   40  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree Table 2 (Continued) 61    Table 2 (Continued)Strongly  31 Catholic   Male  51 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree Master’s Moderately  32  United Methodist Female   66  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree Brother-in-law, Strongly  33  Baptist Female   65 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  Half-brother  disagree             Doctoral 34  United Methodist Female   66  Degree  Yes  Widowed  Black  Yes  Sibling  Neither Strongly  35 Catholic   Male  40 Some College   Yes  Married  White  No  Cousin  disagree Master’s Moderately  36  Episcopalian  Male  43  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  agree Bachelor’s  37  United Methodist Female   53  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  Neither Moderately  38  United Methodist  Male  56 HS  Diploma   Yes  Married  White  Yes  No  disagree Aunt/Uncle, Non-Associates Cousin,  Aunt-Strongly  39  denominational  Male  26  Degree  Yes  Married  White  Yes  in-law  agree Non-Aunt/Uncle, Strongly  40  denominational Female   26 Some College   Yes  Married  White  Yes  Cousin  agree  62              Locating the authorMany feminist scholars have focused on how a person’s standpoint or location within a given set of social conditions affects how they view different oppressions (Collins 1986; Smith 1987; Haraway 1988; Acker 1990; Solinger 2005). Additionally, research has shown objectivity is an unreachable status (Collins 1986; Smith 1987; Haraway 1988). Smith (1987) argues it is time researchers stops approaching subjects asunchangeable objects under investigation. Researchers must acknowledge the agency of the subjects under consideration and the biases inherent in our logics and methods (Smith 1987; Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva 2008). Situated knowledge allows us to understand the location and the perspective of actors within a given social phenomenon (Haraway 1988).It is through the viewpoints of multiple actors at different positions in the matrix of privilege that researchers can gain a clearer picture of what is actually happening.Unlocatable knowledge that presumes the world is static and can be studied from only one viewpoint leads to “irresponsible knowledge claims” (Haraway 1988). Haraway (1988) suggests the ability to state knowledge claims without situating them is a “god trick” that those in positions of power play to claim they understand various oppressions fully. Those in positions of power present their knowledge as completely objective and use it to support the current system of power and hierarchy within society (Collins 1986; Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva 2008).This is why it is of utmost importance that all researchers locate and state the viewpoint of our research in order for it to be legitimate (Collins 1986). The understanding of oppressions and social phenomenon depends on a person’s position within the privilege matrix (Collins 1986). In order to explain standpoint theory, Collins 63                    (1986) uses the example of black, female professors within sociology. This group has a unique standpoint of being an outsider within the dominant or privileged group ofsociologists and the academy. This unique perspective enables them to see the world and oppression through a different lens. According to Collins (1986), established sociological insiders are predominately white men and usually of higher social classes. Since those in power have the ability to influence and shape knowledge, what is considered sociology is really only sociology from the perspective of the powerful insider group. Collins (1986) argues the outsider within position in the discipline is essential to understanding society and gaining different viewpoints of multiple truths. The best option, based on this theory, would be to get rid of outsider and insider statuses and learn to take multiple perspectives and viewpoints into consideration when examining a social phenomenon. The problemwith this approach is that in our society it seems there must always be an outgroup orOther.If the perspective of the dominant group is the only one taken, then researchersdevelop a skewed picture of reality and the existing inequalities continue uninterrupted.This is why both Haraway (1988) and Collins (1986) argue for the importance of understanding all viewpoints in the matrix of privilege and situating our knowledge inlocation and time. Researchers must move away from only “marking” that which is different from the privileged group and begin to mark everyone and locate everyone within their respective viewpoints. Each person’s position within the matrix of oppression must be acknowledged and researchers must take into account different standpoints in order to begin to even approach truth.64               Based on this reasoning, I think it is of utmost importance to locate myself within the matrix of domination and explain my standpoint relative to this context. By understanding my position and my struggles in this research, the reader can gain a morecomplete understanding of the story this research tells. I was drawn to this topic of inquiry because of my background growing up in a Christian church in a conservative Southern town and then coming out as a lesbian in my late teens. This background led me to ask a number of questions. How could this social institution, which had such an important impact on my life, be a core source of my oppression and self-questioning?How could the people who watched me grow, watched me preach in front of my church, watched me become a productive adult citizen now judge me based on my sexualityalone? Would knowing someone personally who identities as gay or lesbian change these beliefs?I was born and raised in a small, rural town in South Carolina. I was baptized into a small United Methodist Church as an infant and raised in that church until I left for college. Although my family attended a mainline denomination, being in small town South Carolina meant religious and political conservatism ran through the majority of churches despite denominational teachings. As a white female in this town I had the privilege of being oblivious to racial problems, at least until I got to high school and began dating an African American boy. I grew up in a divorced, working class family, which also affects my worldviews.When I left home for college at 18 years old, I finally realized why I felt“different” from others throughout my teenage years. I began the long coming outprocess, which never really ends, during my first year of college. Now, over a decade 65                 later, I am still not out to my entire family for fear of being ostracized due to their religious convictions. This standpoint of being a lesbian woman raised in the Deep South lead me to question why it is that many Christians are so opposed to homosexuality. I questioned why people take homosexuality to be a grave sin, yet ignore the numerous other Old Testament teachings (such as prohibitions against eating shrimp – Leviticus 11:9-12 and wearing clothing made of mixed fabrics – Leviticus 19:19, or commands to feed the poor - Isaiah 58:10-11). Beginning in my undergraduate work I started to question why knowing someone who is gay or lesbian often does not improve outgroup relations for many Christians. Having friends who were kicked out of their homes and estranged from their families for being gay or lesbian did not make sense to me. This iswhere this project began. It began out of my personal desire to understand how a religion ostensibly based on tolerance and forgiveness could breed so much fear and prejudice. It began out of my need to understand how friends and families could ostracize someone close to them because of who that person falls in love with. This is my unique standpointfor understanding this topic.I have strived throughout this project to be as balanced and fair as possible. Frommy subjective location within the matrix of domination, I offer here an explanation of the reasons I find Christians can, at times, use their own religion to turn away those they love and care for. As difficult as this project has been, I believe I now have a greater understanding of why some Christians are opposed to homosexuality and feel if theycannot encourage gays and lesbians to try to change their sexuality, it is best to separate themselves from them. I feel this study may help the reader to gain some insight about 66                         Christians who cannot accept their own friends and family members’ sexuality and relationships.However, it is not my intention to stand up for this viewpoint or to justify it.Although I may better understand their reasoning, I cannot condone a religion which leads to the pain and suffering of others. As Barton (2012:4-5) explains, “because most Christian churches in the Bible Belt construct homosexuality as sinful, lesbians and gay men from the region must choose between staying in… the ‘toxic closet’ or risk rejection and ostracism from the people who are supposed to care for them most – their families, friends, and neighbors.”Overall, my personal ties to this research have allowed me to more thoroughly understand the topic and to ask better questions of my respondents. However, at the same time, my insider position in this topic made the research process extremely stressful.Many of the interviews were difficult to sit through. This project has taught me how complicated qualitative research can be. From the assumption of one interviewee who started the interview with, “You’re gay right? … I’ll do the interview if you think you can actually be objective”, to the continuous attempts to devalue the lives of gays and lesbians, including my own life, because of their sexuality, I found this project to be rewarding while simultaneously emotionally draining. I think it is important to note most respondents did not realize they were devaluing me personally; the majority of respondents assumed I am heterosexual and Protestant. Many respondents spoke in terms of us (the respondent and I) versus them (gays and lesbians). They assumed I held thesame or similar beliefs to them as well. For example, one Catholic respondent explains,67                   “I'm not Protestant, so I'm not a memorize the Bible kind of person like you guys do. You guys are so good at that.”I must also note many of the interviewees from the Deep South were verysupportive of gays and lesbians. They spoke of Christianity’s mandate to love one’s neighbor and spoke of a God who was not judgmental. Although Mississippi still has pockets of conservative religion that specifically preach against homosexuality and recommend turning away gays and lesbians, a growing portion of Mississippi Christians wish to open their doors to gays and lesbians and leave the judging to their God.Overall, by situating myself in this research project, I demonstrate my accounthere is not completely objective, yet it is an account that strives to be balanced (Bartkowski 2004). As Bartkowski (2004:18) explains, it is impossible for social scientists to “treat their subject matter like an ‘object’.” To the contrary, we can only strive to provide a balanced appraisal of the subject. Just as other scholars attempt to provide a balanced picture of religious movements, such as Bartkowski’s (2004) account of the Promise Keepers and Kelly’s (2012) account of crisis pregnancy center activists, I attempt here to balance a sympathetic understanding of Mississippi Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward gays and lesbians while simultaneously “placing these firsthand accounts in a broader context and examining the social forces that bear down upon [them]” (Bartkowski 2004:18).68                      CHAPTER IVFOR THE BIBLE (OR MY PASTOR/PRIEST) TELLS ME SO: MISSISIPPI CHRISTIANS’ BELIEFS ABOUT THE BIBLE & HOMOSEXUALITYWhat do Mississippi Christians believe the Bible says about homosexuality? Ishomosexuality an ultimate sin or not a sin at all? Should Christian churches accept gays and lesbians fully or insist they turn away from their “sin” before they can be consideredtruly Christian? This chapter seeks to provide an understanding of what Mississippi Christians believe the Bible says about homosexuality and how they believe the issueshould be dealt with in Christian churches. I begin by discussing what Mississippi Christians think about the Bible generally and how they believe it should be interpreted. I use results from both survey data and interviews to provide an overview of what the Bible means to this sample. Next, I lay out the six biblical passages commonly used byChristians to explain their opposition to homosexuality. I then examine what Mississippi Christians believe the Bible actually says about homosexuality using interview responses.Next, I consider how – and if – interviewees perceive these passages or others as relevant to homosexuality. I show whether they adamantly oppose homosexuality or believe Christian churches should welcome all people regardless of sexual orientation, most are unable to tell me specifically where the issue of homosexuality is discussed in the Bible.Instead, Mississippi Christians depend on the beliefs of their denomination or specific pastor/priest for guidance. Finally, I consider what the conflicting views of opposition to 69                      homosexuality versus acceptance of homosexuality means for Christians and how thisissue often creates discomfort between churches who do not agree.The BibleFor most Christians the Bible provides a framework and guidebook for living a moral life. While the majority of survey respondents suggest being a true Christian one must believe the Bible is infallible (incapable of mistake), interview responses indicate various groups interpret the meaning of the Bible differently. Some Christians, especially evangelical Protestants, argue the Bible should be taken literally. They suggest because God does not make mistakes, Christians should take the scriptures at face value. Manyevangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics feel there is only one true meaning ofscripture that should be apparent from reading the text literally. This subset of Christians also believes the Bible is the inerrant (without error) word of God. On the other hand, some Christians view the Bible as a set of guidelines for living, but do not suggest it iswithout error or must be taken literally – this is the belief of most Catholics and mainline Protestants.To clarify, infallible is a broader term used to explain that the Bible is incapableof mistake.  This does not necessarily mean there are no errors in the Bible; rather it indicates that the message of the Bible cannot be mistaken. Even if error is present in the Bible, the message is clear. Inerrancy refers more directly to the actual text and argues there are no errors in the facts of the Bible. In addition, inerrancy suggests there are no contradictions in the Bible. Therefore, it is possible to believe the Bible is infallible, without believing it is inerrant. On the other hand, the belief that the Bible is inerrant implies infallibility. Despite these differences, many Christians use these terms 70                 interchangeably. Biblical literalism is a closely related term and is used to mean biblical passages should be interpreted at face value. While most conservative Christians believe all three, that the Bible is infallible, inerrant, and meant to be interpreted literally, more moderate and liberal Christians usually move away from biblical literalism. That is, Christians usually believe the Bible, or at least the message of the Bible is infallible or incapable of mistake, however, it is only the more conservative Christians who believe the actual text is without error and contradiction and the most conservative Christians who believe all passages in the Bible should be taken literally. Therefore, it is possible for Christians to believe all, some, or none of these things about the Bible.Most Mississippi Christians (76.9 percent) surveyed indicate they agree with the statement, “It is very important for true Christians to believe that the Bible is the infallible Word of God.” When we break down agreement with this statement by denomination we see 54.5 percent of mainline Protestants agree, 84.8 percent of Catholics agree, and 92.7 percent of evangelical Protestants agree. Only 8.4 percent of the sample indicated they agree with the statement, “The Bible may be an important book of moral teachings, but it is no more inspired by God than were many other such books in human history.” Despite religious affiliation or denomination in this sample the Bible is considered by most to be a significant guide to life as a Christian.Despite the high rate of consistency on surveys, interviews reveal in actuality there is more variance among Christian beliefs about the Bible than is evident at first glance. The most frequent terminology used to discuss the Bible is “the inspired word of God”, inerrant, and literal within context. Literally within context may sound to some like an oxymoron; however, to this sample it made perfect sense. For example, one mainline 71                   respondent, Kelsey, explains, “I think [the Bible] should be taken literally, but I think that you have to… take into account their intentions and what it was about when it was written and the genre.”All in all, beliefs about how the Bible should be understood range along a continuum from completely inerrant and literal to only a book written by men a long time ago. Gabby, a mainline Protestant who has not attended church in four years yet remained an official member of her congregation, is one of only two respondents who believe the Bible is only a book written a long time ago. When I asked her to tell me what she thinks about the Bible she says, “[The Bible] is fake. Well, I mean, it's not fake. I'm sure it was written.” Her statement makes clear she does not agree with the majority of respondents who, as a minimum, believe it is the inspired word of God. Most respondents hold morecomplex views somewhere in between the two extremes of completely inerrant and literal versus only a book. The bulk of interviewees agreed with Victor, a mainline Protestant, who believes the Bible is “basically a written record of God's account of how we are to live our lives.” The individuals who fall in the middle take more time to explain the nuance of their beliefs and understanding of the Bible.The terminology used and the beliefs about biblical inerrancy largely fall along the lines of religious identification. Although, approximately half of the sample (52.5 percent) agrees the Bible is inerrant, this belief varies widely by religious identification.While all evangelical Protestants interviewed claim the Bible is the inerrant Word of God, only 36.3 percent of Catholics and 36.8 percent of mainline Protestants use this terminology when asked to share their beliefs about the Bible. As previously mentioned,those between the extremes take more time to fully explain their views. For example, 72                   when I asked Kelsey, a mainline Protestant, if she thought the Bible was inerrant, she yes, but then clarifies it depends on what I mean by inerrant. I ask for her definition ofinerrant and she responds, “To me it means that its God's word and God doesn't mess up on that. Are there editing mistakes? Yes. Are their contradictions? Yes.” Therefore, for many Mississippi Christians how the Bible should be understood and interpreted is not a straightforward topic. Although Kelsey believes God’s message is inerrant, this does not mean to her the Bible itself is without mistakes. The few questions asked about the Bible in the survey obviously limit respondents and lead them to put themselves into a box thatmay not represent fully the complexity of their beliefs. In reality, people’s views and beliefs are much more complex than they appear on the surface.This ambivalence again was evident in discussions about whether the Bible should be taken literally. In addition, interview respondents’ religious affiliations wereeven more influential when it came to this issue. The majority of both mainline Protestants and Catholics interviewed agreed the Bible should not be taken literally. Of the mainline Protestants asked to tell me their views about the Bible, 68.4 percent indicate the Bible should not be read literally. Only one out of 19 mainline Protestants suggests the Bible should always be taken literally. Nine out of 11 Catholics (81.8 percent) agree the Bible is not meant to be taken literally. On the opposite end of the spectrum, 80 percent of evangelical Protestants explain the Bible must be taken literally.For instance, Regina, an evangelical Baptist, explains the Bible is “totally truth.” She argues it is the inerrant Word of God and should be taken completely literally. However, it is important to point out most evangelical Protestants argue scripture must becontextualized before it can be taken literally; that is, the literal interpretation must occur73                    within the context the passage was written. Had this question not been asked in interviews, readers could assume all respondents who call for a literal interpretation of the Bible mean scripture should be taken completely at face value. However, most respondents who call for the literal interpretation of the Bible acknowledge we must take into consideration the context and the style of writing before we can interpret the true intent of a verse.Despite the nuances, mainline Protestants and Catholics agree more closely on how the Bible should be understood and interpreted and this differs from evangelical Protestants’ views. Where Catholics do diverge from mainline Protestants is some Catholics feel the Bible is not for laypeople to interpret. Manning (1999) explains within the Catholic Church conservative and liberals are divided over where they locate moral authority. She describes a conservative Catholic as “one who accepts the authority of the magisterium [the authority of the pope and bishops, within the Catholic Church, to define the authentic teachings of the church] and feels that a good Catholic should be obedient to all church teachings” (Manning 1999:64-65). On the other hand, a liberal Catholic “questions the church, locates authority in herself [or himself], and only selectively adheres to church doctrine” (Manning 1999:65). Based on these definitions, most Catholics in this study fall into the conservative category, they feel the Bible should be interpreted by the Church authority, not individuals. This differs from evangelical Protestants; Catholics believe the Bible must be interpreted by the authority of the Catholic Church, whereas, many evangelicals argue all individual laypeople have the ability to understand the Bible by taking a literal understanding of the passages. That is, no interpretation is necessarily needed for evangelical Protestants because the Bible can 74           be understood verbatim. This difference also leads to different emphasis placed on the Bible by Catholics and evangelical Protestants.Since the Bible is not directly for laypeople in the Catholic Church to interpret, according to some respondents, they discuss a lack of connection to the Bible or express their difficulty in understanding the Bible. For example, Hillary describes it this way, “There is really one interpretation of the Bible… It’s meant to be the truth. It’s meant to be a certain thing, not for all to interpret it in the way it speaks to us. That’s why I’mCatholic.” Hillary is clear the Bible is not meant to be taken literally in all places, what she is referring to is the authority of the Vatican to define the one true meaning of the Bible. Therefore, it is important to decipher between this one true interpretation she speaks of and evangelical Protestants’ belief in a literal interpretation of the Bible. Along the same lines as Hillary, Brenda says, “This might be the Catholic [in me]… I just don’tfeel connected to the Bible.” Likewise, when I ask Kristina what the Bible says about homosexuality she indicates she does not know and she is “resorting back to that the Catholics don't know the Bible like they should [excuse].” These findings are important because D’Antonio et al. (2013) show most Catholics today do not feel the Catholic Church’s authority is necessary. Therefore, Mississippi Catholics interviewed in this study fall into the minority of Catholics across the United States who continue to rely on the Vatican’s teaching authority, rather than their own authority to interpret scripture and Church doctrine. However, this does not mean Mississippi Catholics do not find the Bible important. Generally, they feel the Bible’s teachings are important, but rely on theauthority of the Catholic Church to interpret the meaning. 75                Even for those who “don’t know the Bible like they should”, the Bible is an important guide for most Christians. Whether they read it directly or have it interpreted by their denomination or specific pastor/priest, the Bible is at the core of their understanding of religion. In this study, I am particularly interested in what Mississippi Christians think the Bible, their congregation, and their denomination say about homosexuality. I now turn to this more specific topic.Homosexuality & Christian churchesSince the majority of Mississippi Christians hold the Bible to be of importance, it is crucial to understand what they believe the Bible says about homosexuality and how Christians should interpret these passages. Over 75 percent of those surveyed indicatethey agree with the statement, “The Bible is the final and complete guide to morality; it contains God’s answers to all important questions about right and wrong.” Therefore, we must consider what Mississippi Christians believe the Bible says about homosexualityand how Christians should deal with this issue.Six Bible verses used to condemn homosexualityWithin Christianity there have been six primary biblical passages used to condemn homosexuality. Three of these passages are found in the Old Testament and three are found in the New Testament. Here I use the King James Version of each passage. Christianity Today reports, according to data collected from the General Social Survey and the National Congregations Survey, the King James Version (KJV) is the most highly read Bible in the United States today (Zylstra 2014). Fifty-five percent of Bible readers report using the King James Version of the Bible compared to the 19 76                   percent who use the New International Version (NIV) (all other versions have readerships in the single digits) (Zylstra 2014). The passages below are KJV translations; however, I footnote where there are major discrepancies in language between the KJV, the NIV, and the New American Bible (NAB). I believe this is necessary because the KJV of the Bible has been largely associated with evangelical Protestant traditions. The NIV, the NAB (used in Catholic mass in the United States), and other translations are more widely used in mainline Protestant and Catholic traditions.The most widely quoted condemnation of homosexuality is the story of Sodomand Gomorrah from Genesis 19 (excerpt, KJV):1 And there came two angels to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate ofSodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people fromevery quarter: 5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know 77                                                                      them.1 6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door. 10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.This story is taken by many evangelical Protestants to mean God destroyed the city of Sodom because the men had sex with other men. The men refused to have sex with Lot’s daughters and instead forced themselves upon Lot’s male guests. Evangelical Protestants argue it was the homosexual acts that occurred that lead to the destruction of the city.1 The NIV translation of verse 5 reads, “They called to Lot, “Where are the men who have came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.” The NAB translation is the same as the NIV except uses the term sexual relations instead of sex.78                                                                       In addition to this passage, other Christians quote Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 as justification for condemning same-sex sexuality. Leviticus is one of two books of law in the Old Testament. It provides regulations and laws for Jews; it explains the rituals and practices necessary to live a moral live. Leviticus 18:22 (KJV) reads: “Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.”2 Leviticus 20:13 (KJV) states: “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed anabomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.” These scriptures are read to mean if a man has sexual relations with another man, instead of a woman, they are sinning against God and will suffer the consequences of these sins, which is death.In the New Testament there are three passages that have been interpreted by some Christians to justify condemning homosexuality. These passages include Romans 1:26, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and 1Timothy 1:10. All three books of the New Testament used to condemn homosexuality are attributed to the writing of the Apostle Paul. In Romans, Paul explains to Rome his theological beliefs and how to live life as a Christian. First Corinthians is a letter to a church Paul founded in Corinth explaining to them it is time to turn away from their sins. Finally, 1 Timothy is the first of two letters from Paul to one of his delegates in Ephesus, Timothy, which provides instructions for leading his church.  2 The NIV translation of Leviticus 18:22 reads, “Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.” Similarly, Leviticus 20:13 in the NIV translation uses the word detestableinstead of abomination. The NAG translation of Leviticus 20:13 reads, “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, they have committed an abomination; the two of them shall be put to death; their bloodguilt is upon them.”79                                                                                     Romans 1:26 (KJV) states: “For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections:for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.”3 1 Corinthians 6:9 (KJV) reads: “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.”4 Finally, 1 Timothy 1:10 (KJV) explains laws are not made for innocent people, but rather “for whoremongers, for themthat defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers5, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.” In these New Testament passages, Paul condemns those who trade “natural” sexual relations with women for those with men. He explains to his churches that those who do not follow what God has intended for sexuality, man and woman for the purpose of procreation, will not go to heaven.What the Bible means about homosexualityThe interpretation of these stories and passages are important to understanding Christians’ views about homosexuality. Many respondents continue to believe Christians must take both the Old and New Testament passages literally which suggests, to them, same-sex relations are always sinful and against the will of God. All evangelical Christians interviewed argue the Bible says homosexuality is always sinful. Most (8 out 3 NIV translation of Romans 1:26, “Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.” NAB translation of Romans 1:26, “Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural.”4 NIV reads “nor men who have sex with men” and NAB reads “nor boy prostitutes” rather than “nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.”5 The NIV translation reads, “for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders…” and NAB translation reads, “the unchaste, sodomites, kidnappers…”80            of 10) rely on both Old Testament and New Testament scriptures to support this argument. Only two evangelicals explain Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament so we must base the judgment that homosexuality is sinful on Paul’s letters in the New Testament. In addition to 100 percent of evangelical Protestants, almost half (45.5 percent) of Catholics also agree the Bible says homosexuality is always sinful. In comparison, only two (10.5 percent) of mainline line Protestants fell into this category.Some Christians suggest the Old Testament passages are no longer relevant to modern day Christians because Jesus fulfilled the scriptures and made the old laws obsolete (Hebrews 8:13; Romans 10:4). Brad, a mainline Protestant, explains Christians today are “more New Testament people.” This leads some to argue the Bible says little or nothing about homosexuality today. Over a third (36.4 percent) of Catholics explain the Bible says little or nothing about homosexuality today. A fifth (21.1 percent) of mainline Protestants agree. These interviewees often suggest the passages are not meant to condemn loving same-sex relationships. They discuss how the scriptures were written in a specific historical context and must be interpreted accordingly. For example, Barbara, a mainline Protestant, explains she thinks the passages are for practical purposes during a specific time in history. Barbara says: Overall, I think a lot of the guidelines from the Old Testament, such as not sleeping with the same-sex are put there for health reasons... and for thecontinuance of the population and procreation. I believe also that God is against promiscuity whether you're straight or homosexual and I think God wants us to be in monogamous relationships... I just don't think it's biblically correct either to select a certain segment of society and be so rejectful of them in general... To me 81                     [the Bible] has scriptures against it, but I don't think it has anymore consequence than the scriptures against having meat products with milk products, because you could end up with a disease. I just think it was for practical purposes.However, another mainline Protestant, Ervin, feels Jesus fulfilled some of the laws of the Old Testament so Christians are no longer obligated to sacrifice animals or becircumcised, but he feels the laws about homosexuality remain unchanged. He explains: I think the Bible is pretty clear on homosexuality… Leviticus talks specifically about homosexuality being an abomination… when [God] gets to homosexuality,or what we call homosexuality, he specifically says that a man should not lie with a male as with a woman... So to me that's very clear, I don't see any other way of interpreting that other than the Bible saying, or specifically [God's] saying, don't do these things... God is sending people and having his prophets and messengers and angels and different people to say don't do these things, and so from thatstandpoint I don't think that I'm misinterpreting that at all in saying essentially no homosexuality.Andrew, an evangelical Protestant, seems to agree. He tells me the “ceremonial laws are fulfilled in Christ,” but still uses the Old Testament as evidence that homosexuality is sinful.Others respondents argue Jesus’ commandments to love one another and not judge outweigh the few verses of scripture that speak about homosexuality.Approximately half (47.4 percent) of mainline Protestants explain the overarching theme of the Bible is to love one another and leave the judgment to God. Casey, a mainline Protestant, describes her feelings about the issue by saying: 82               I feel like you have to look at the Bible and its message as a whole, and Jesus' life and what he left us and apply those. So what do I feel like the Bible says about homosexuality? I feel like the Bible tells us that every person is a child of God and every person should be loved equally.As with most topics in this study, Catholics seem to fall between evangelical Protestants and mainline Protestants. However, interpreting what the Bible says about homosexuality is one of the few instances where Catholics align more closely with evangelical Protestants than with mainline Protestants. As stated, over half of the Catholics interviewed indicate homosexuality is always sinful. Nevertheless, as I will show later in this chapter, Catholics’ views shift back towards mainline Protestants when it comes to how Christians should deal with this issue. Before we turn to beliefs about how Christians should deal with homosexuality, what Bible verses are the 42.5 percent of Mississippi Christians sampled referring to when they argue homosexuality is always sinful? Are they using the six most popular verses quoted above or something else?Quote that verse… The majority of arguments against homosexuality today ultimately revolve around religion and specifically the Bible. There is a clear link between the belief that one’s religion holds absolute truths and the negative beliefs about homosexuality (Rowatt et al. 2006). Even in politics, where there is ostensibly a separation from religion, the majorargument against gay and lesbian civil rights remains religious in nature. Therefore, it is important to understand where exactly in the Bible Mississippi Christians find their justification for opposition to homosexuality. 83                 Although many interview respondents indicated homosexuality is sinful and “against the will of God”, most were unsure of exactly what the Bible says abouthomosexuality. Over a quarter of respondents (27.5 percent) admit they do not know what the Bible actually says about homosexuality. Some vaguely discussed Old Testament passages about homosexuality while others indicated they believe Paul discussed the issue in the New Testament, but most admitted they could not quote a scripture verse that discussed the topic. Therefore, within this sample of MississippiChristians, the idea that homosexuality is sinful is prevalent, however, why this is theheld belief is less certain. “For the Bible tells me so” may be the common refrain of Mississippi Christians, but what the Bible actually says is less clear. Many hold same-sex relations are not natural or what God intended, but the specifics of why have been lost in translation.So, what do Mississippi Christians say when asked to provide specific places the Bible references homosexuality? Many respondents agree a prohibition against homosexuality is in the Old Testament. Twenty-three of the 40 interviewees (57.5 percent) mention the Old Testament when discussing what the Bible says abouthomosexuality; though most respondents did not know where in the Old Testament the verse(s) were found. Seven respondents indicate they believe there is some prohibition against homosexuality in either Deuteronomy or Leviticus, the books of law. Some mainline Protestants quoted or paraphrased Leviticus 18:22 when I asked if they knew of any specific places the Bible talks about homosexuality; yet, they did not know the chapter or verse where the quote was located. Two evangelical Protestants mention thestory of Adam and Eve as a story to show homosexuality is not natural. For example, 84                 Angela, an evangelical Protestant, argues the prohibition against homosexuality begins with Adam and Eve (Genesis 1). She says, “The Lord tells us that he made Adam, and Eve for Adam, and he said that a man should not lust after another man nor a woman lustafter another woman. And that's just going against what God has said in the Bible.” All in all, respondents were sure the Old Testament says homosexuality is a sin, but where it says that is a different question.Evangelical Protestants were the only respondents to mention books in the New Testament where there were references to homosexuality. The books in the New Testament they indicate that prohibit homosexuality are Romans, Corinthians, and 1st Timothy. One evangelical respondent, Darlene, paraphrases 1st Corinthians 6:9 which she interprets to say homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of God. She explains:It's in a number of places… it says in one part that those who practice homosexuality cannot inherit the kingdom of God… it says that you can't be a believer and follow that because… being a Christian you inherit the kingdom of God. How can you inherit it if you're doing exactly what it says you cannot?... [Also] Paul talks a lot about it, I think it's in Corinthians... it's in a couple of the letters. A few other respondents from each category (evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, and Catholic) indicate they believe Paul mentions homosexuality in a letter, but are not sure where this is found in the Bible.Some mainline Protestants and Catholics indicate they do not know of any place in the Bible that speaks directly to the issue of what we call homosexuality today. Over one quarter of mainline Protestants (26.3 percent) and Catholics (27.3 percent) explain 85                   the Bible does not directly address the issue of homosexuality today. No evangelical Protestants agreed with this sentiment. Kelsey, a mainline Protestant, tells me the Old Testament speaks about homosexuality, but “Jesus didn't even mention homosexuality. I think it was more of a non-issue. As you know I'm Methodist and we talk about all people being of sacred worth… everybody is created in the image of God and also itdoesn't really give us a clear answer on why are people homosexual.” Along the same lines, Peter, a Catholic, explains:There's a lot of one-liners in the Old Testament about sexuality that have to be taken pretty much in context, but overall I'm not all that aware of many things in scripture that address homosexuality blatantly unless you go into the Old Testament and find some things during the time of the ancient Hebrew life that have some words about it.Another Catholic respondent, Rick, says he does not think the Bible has anything to say about homosexuality, rather he believes “what the Bible does is it gives us a framework within which our own sexuality can be rightly expressed and that framework would bewithin marriage, but does it say anything about homosexual persons per say or homosexuality? No.”Finally, there was one Catholic respondent, Hillary, who tells me she does nothave the verses memorized; however, she has a list of all the verses she can read to me.She explains “I'm not Protestant, so I'm not a memorize-the-Bible kind of person like you guys [Protestants] do. [Protestants] are so good at that, but I've got like a kind of listing here, I've got a little cheat sheet here.” She goes on to list Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, Deuteronomy 22:5 (“Do not wear opposite sex clothing.”), Jude 1:7 (discusses86                 Sodom and Gomorrah, “how they gave themselves up to several immoralities, how they gave themselves up to sexual immoralities and perversion.”), and Romans 1:24-27 (“men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.”).Whereas, most respondents were unsure of the Bible verses about homosexuality, others went further than the typical six verses listed above. These few individuals usually conflated gender and sexuality. For instance, the passage pointed out above, Deuteronomy 22:5, is about wearing the opposite sex’s clothing. Obviously thisrespondent believes dressing in opposite sex clothing means the person is gay or lesbian.To the contrary, most cross dressers identify as heterosexual (Docter and Prince 1997).Also one evangelical Protestant explains that many verses speak of “the feminine.” She implies men acting feminine equates to homosexuality in the Bible. This makes sense when we consider the strong relationship between conservative Christians’ genderideology and their condemnation of homosexuality (Gallagher 2004; Konieczny 2013).This lack of specificity regarding what the Bible actually says abouthomosexuality may not be as surprising for mainline Protestants and Catholics who donot find the Bible as essential or feel it is not within their authority to interpret. However, the fact that many evangelical Protestants are unsure what the Bible says about homosexuality is unexpected. Evangelical Protestants’ belief that everyone can and should read and understand the Bible for themselves combined with their staunch opposition to homosexuality would suggest they would be more aware of biblical passages than the data shows. 87              So, if Mississippi Christians at large are not sure exactly what the Bible says about homosexuality, where do these beliefs stem from? How can people so uncertain about what the Bible says on the topic be so adamant homosexuality is either a sin or not a sin? I find most respondents’ beliefs rely more on the teachings and authority of their denomination or pastor/priest than directly on the Bible.For my pastor/priest told me so…Respondents largely appeared to trust their denomination’s stance or their pastor/priest’s interpretation of the Bible on this issue. As previously mentioned, conservative Catholics often base their opposition to same-sex marriage on the Catholic Church’s stance on gender and sexuality which indicates sexual intimacy is only for the purposes of reproduction within marriage (Konieczny 2013). Tim, a Catholic, says “I haven't actually read [what the Bible says], but I mean I've always been taught that [homosexuality] is wrong.” Another Catholic, Whitney, tells me she believes being homosexual is not sinful; however, acting on those desires is a sin. When I asked herwhere in scripture it says homosexual acts are sinful, she responds, “I know there are scripture passages... [but] I'm not a real big quote scripture, remember scripture verbatimgirl.” Similarly, Regina, an evangelical Protestant, tells me homosexuality is “not the norm” and she believes it is a sin, but when asked to provide a biblical justification for this belief she says, “I don't concentrate on that. All I do is the love of God.”Only a handful of respondents indicate they hold beliefs that are not directly in line with their church’s position on this issue. One such respondent was Leo, a mainline Protestant, who says his church is “evolving. The church I believe wants to find ways to grow and it wants to find a way of doing what we’ve always said we do which is that we 88                      accept all persons and all persons are a child of Jesus Christ regardless of their backgrounds.” However, he says even though his church is changing, he believes his views about homosexuality are more progressive than his church’s current position.Likewise, Marie, a mainline Protestant, explains even though she would like to think herchurch feels the same way she does about homosexuality, one situation made her think she may have a different opinion about the topic than her church. She describes the situation this way, “a gay man that I know wanted to go into the priesthood and ourbishop advised him not to… I think they should have accepted him and encouraged himto join the priesthood.” These were the exceptions to the rule because most respondents said they think or hope their views are the same as their church’s views. Despite the factmost respondents feel they agree with their church’s position, it is clear from the interviews that this may not always be the case. Even when respondents hold an opposingview to a member of their own congregation, they continue to believe their views are the views of their pastor/priest and their church at large.Obviously homosexuality is a contentious issue in Christian churches in Mississippi. Even within the same congregation, members hold conflicting views and beliefs about homosexuality. When we look across religious ideologies these divides become even greater. How do Mississippians who claim a Christian identity based on the same sacred text, the Bible, come to such diverse opinions on the issue of homosexuality?Additionally, what does this mean for Christian churches? Does this issue lead to division among Mississippi Christians?89                    Conflicting interpretationsThose who do not interpret the Bible to condemn homosexuality use the same Bible to support their position that gays and lesbians should be accepted or even embraced in Christian churches as those who see homosexuality as always sinful. For instance, many mainline Protestants and Catholics point to passages about love and judgment that they argue override the few misinterpreted (in their opinion) Bible passages used to justify positions against homosexuality. For example, Isabelle, a mainline Protestant, explains “any of us sitting in the church wanting to deny someone because they’re homeless, homosexual, or black, or white then we shouldn’t be thereeither.” Rick, a Catholic, agrees with Isabelle. He states “I’m very hesitant because I’mnot God and I have absolutely no intention to judge whether someone else is in a state of sin or not because I don’t know that person’s conscience.”This is not to say evangelical Protestants, or those who believe homosexuality is sinful more broadly, are ignoring biblical passages about love and judgment. In reality, both groups indicate it is love that leads them to hold their position so strongly. Those who argue homosexuality is sinful suggest it is from a position of compassion they preach the “truth” and it is because of this compassion they feel it is important to help those “struggling” with homosexuality. Candace, an evangelical Protestant, argues “I think it’s so important for Christians to be able to reach out in love to anybody who is walking in sin because if you see someone whose like caught in a trap and you don’tmake an effort to help them get out then what kind of love is that?” Along the same lines, another evangelical Protestant, Erica, said her church’s position on homosexuality is “the 90                      same as the Bible’s position. Love people, but tell them the truth. Tell them the truth and love.”This is an extremely important caveat because evangelical Protestants are often painted by more liberal factions as approaching the issue of homosexuality out of irrational hate or fear. Evangelical Protestants’ answers often displayed an intense fear surrounding the issue of homosexuality; however, most answers did not seem to come from a sense of hatred or a desire to punish gays and lesbians. Many evangelical Protestants who wholly opposed homosexuality felt it was truly in the best interest of gays and lesbians to tell them they were sinning and to help them overcome this sin.When the topic of homosexuality is viewed through an evangelical Protestant lens, theirstance seems to be more consistent and internally rational. Since evangelical Protestants truly believe someone who does not turn away from homosexuality will suffer the consequences, hell, it would indeed be in the best interest of gays and lesbians that Christians attempt to stop that from happening. This is not to validate those beliefs;however, seeing the world through this lens suggests opposition to homosexuality can come from concern for the well-being of others. Despite where the beliefs about homosexuality come from, it still raises an interesting dilemma. It positions Christians today into two camps when it comes to the issue of homosexuality. On the one hand, there are those who condemn homosexuality and believe it is Christians’ duty to teach others about the sinfulness of homosexuality.On the other hand, there are those who believe Christians must accept gays and lesbians with open arms. Some of those who are accepting believe homosexuality is a natural and 91                 normal part of humanity, while others are less sure and simply feel they must leave thejudgment of homosexuality to God.   How should churches handle homosexuality?Since Christian’s views about homosexuality largely fit into one of theseopposing sides, Christians hold very different views about how to address gays andlesbians. When discussing how Christians should deal with the issue of homosexuality, Mississippi Christian’s answers displayed high levels of ambivalence. Their answers confirm and extend Cadge et al.’s (2012) findings of ambivalence about the issue of homosexuality. Cadge et al. (2012) found mainline Protestant, evangelical Protestant, and Catholic clergy hold ambivalent beliefs about homosexuality and how to address thisissue within their church. Interviews with Mississippi Christians indicate this ambivalence extends beyond clergy to laypeople across religious category.Most, but not all, interview respondents agreed gays and lesbians should be welcomed into their church, however, the degree of their acceptance and the reasons for welcoming this population varied. For evangelical Protestants, welcoming gays and lesbians into Christian churches is a way to reach them and attempt to change their behaviors. Eight out of the ten evangelical Protestants interviewed say they would welcome gays and lesbians to attend their church so they could understand that their behavior is sinful and repent of this sin. For example, Angela, an evangelical Protestant,explains, “I guess we should welcome then with loving arms and uh, then therefore they… grow closer to the Lord then they would hopefully learn more about God’s word and that this lifestyle is a sin and then they would hopefully turn from that and want to please the Lord and not do that anymore.” One evangelical Protestant, Andrew, believes 92                  anyone should be welcomed at his church, “but in terms of to be considered a member, Ithink there needs to be an acknowledgement of biblical standards of morality.” For clarity purposes, Andrew does not believe gays and lesbians meet this standard of morality.Other respondents indicate gays and lesbians are welcome to attend their church as long as they are not “flaunting their sexuality” or as Brenda, a Catholic respondent, puts it, “as long as they're not trying to convert the church or change the fundamental values of our church with their beliefs.” Over a third (36.4 percent) of Catholics describe a conditional welcome to gays and lesbians. Only one mainline Protestant, Paula, agrees gays and lesbians should be allowed to attend church “as long as they didn’t flaunt their homosexuality, just like I don’t want someone to flaunt their alcoholism… I don’t want that sort of thing flaunted as the accepted way to live because I don’t really think it is.”As opposed to evangelical Protestants welcoming gays and lesbians to change them and Catholics conditionally welcoming gays and lesbians as long as they do not display signs of their sexuality, the majority (78.9) of mainline Protestants indicate gays and lesbians should be fully welcomed into churches without condition. Those Mississippi Christians who call for full acceptance (either because they do not believe homosexuality is sinful or because they do not feel it is their place to judge), primarilymainline Protestants and some Catholics, acknowledge they are probably in the minority.Jason, a mainline Protestant, explains “I would vote to ordain United Methodist clergy who are lesbian or gay. I’m probably in the minority here in Mississippi but I would vote for it.” In addition to being a minority within mainline Protestantism in Mississippi, Adler (2012) also indicates mainline Protestant churches in general are on the decline.Since only 11 percent of Mississippi Christians identify as mainline Protestant and these 93                    numbers continue to decline at the same time evangelical Protestantism grows or remainsconstant, the acceptance of gays and lesbians by mainline Protestants may not be as beneficial as these data suggest. The shrinking number of mainline Protestants in the United States means that trends towards full acceptance of gays and lesbians within Christianity will be slow (Adler 2012).Where beliefs diverge even further is on the issue of whether gays and lesbiansshould hold leadership positions in Christian churches. All evangelical Protestant respondents explain gays and lesbians should not be allowed to hold leadership positions in a church because they are choosing to continue living a “lifestyle” of sin. Caleb explains he objects to gays and lesbians holding leadership positions in his church because:I don’t think that it’s pertinent to a Christian lifestyle. I don’t think that homosexuality is acceptable in a Christian lifestyle so for them to hold leadership in the church would say that the leadership isn’t leading a Christian lifestyle. Our leaders in our church are people that I look to be someone an ideal to be sought after.In the same way, Darlene says gays and lesbians cannot be leaders in a church because “I think that they’re living in sin and you can’t live like that. How can you uphold the beliefs if you don’t really believe it?”Catholics again take the middle road on this topic. Over a third (36.4 percent) of Catholics interviewed suggest gays and lesbians should be completely welcomed and allowed to hold leadership positions in churches. About a quarter (27.3 percent) of Catholic respondents argue gays and lesbians should be allowed to hold all leadership 94              positions if they take a vow of celibacy or are not acting on their desires. A few say gays and lesbians should be allowed in some positions of leadership but not others. For example, gays and lesbians should be allowed to teach Sunday school classes/catechismclasses, but not be allowed to hold positions that require ordination. Others suggest gays and lesbians can be priests or nuns because this requires a vow of celibacy; therefore, their sexuality is irrelevant. Here we see again the conditional acceptance of gays and lesbians in the Catholic Church. Finally, some agree with evangelical Protestants that gays and lesbians should not be allowed to hold any leadership positions. For instance, Tim explains he cannot justify gays and lesbians holding leadership positions in his church if he disagrees with the way they live their lives. He says:That’s a question there; kind of loaded. You know if you, I don’t really know howto answer that one. To be such a simple question, it’s kind of a hard question, because if you believe in gays being wrong well then you shouldn’t believe that they should hold a leadership role in the church. I mean it’s kind of a hard stand to say yeah that’s fine and then you believe against what they do.When discussing why gays and lesbians should not hold leadership positions in Christian churches, many Christians compare homosexuality to other sins. For instance, Candace, an evangelical Protestant, argues against gays and lesbians holding leadership positions by comparing homosexuality to adultery and stealing. She states, “People look to leaders as examples and to me that would be like putting someone who is an adulterer in a leadership position in the church or someone who was a thief, a well-known thief in a leadership position in the church, and that wouldn’t be wise.”95                 Although this is used as justification for exclusion, most indicate homosexuality is no worse than other sins. Like David, an evangelical Protestant, who says he treats homosexuality like any other sin, “it’s not any worse, it’s not any better. God considers sin, sin.” However, these interviewees have a difficult time explaining why, if all Christians are sinners, gays and lesbians should be excluded from leadership positions in churches. The most common answer is gays and lesbians are choosing to continue to live a “lifestyle” of sin. When I asked Caleb, an evangelical Protestant, why gays and lesbiansshould not be allowed in leadership since all Christians are sinners, he responds, “It depends. If somebody is striving after any sin I don’t think they should be in leadership… I think leadership should be held to a higher standard so it’s not necessarily that they’re homosexual per say. I think it’s that they’re living a sinful lifestyle as a Christian.”Here it is important to point out many Mississippi Christians do not feel being gay or lesbian is the sin; rather it is acting on this desire that is sinful. A Catholic respondent, Kristina, explains, “Being homosexual is not the sin, the sin is the act of acting on being homosexual.” Therefore, most Christians who believe homosexuality is sinful suggestgays and lesbian can and should try to change their sexuality to heterosexuality or should remain celibate, especially if they wish to serve as leaders in a church. Another Catholic, Susan, sums this perspective up succinctly. She argues:If you’re a married person, a male-female married person, you know in a heterosexual relationship and you are having an affair you’re living in a state of sin. And if you continue in that state of sin, and this is my opinion and I think that’s what my church teaches, then I think it disqualifies you from someleadership roles. So, if that’s true then I think if a homosexual person is in a 96                   sexual relationship that would disqualify them too. But, if they’re in a celibate state, I don’t think that disqualifies them.Again we see a continuum forming, with mainline Protestants encouraging full acceptance of gays and lesbians, Catholics moving toward acceptance but continuing to place special conditions on gays and lesbians, and evangelical Protestants allowing gays and lesbians to attend their churches in order to change them but unwilling to grant themequal rights within their church. So, what do these opposing beliefs mean for Mississippi Christians? How do these religious ideologies and denominations interact in the public sphere? Do they ignore the other’s beliefs and practices or does it lead to division between churches?Beliefs about churches with opposing viewsDuring interviews, one of the questions that seemed to arouse the most feeling oremotion involved asking respondents about churches in conflict with respondents’ own.For instance, when I asked David, an evangelical Protestant, how he felt about churches that do not believe homosexuality is a sin he responds, “I think they’re apostate and they’ve fooled themselves into a belief that is contrary to what God has said.” Frances, an evangelical Protestant, agrees saying “I don’t think they’re following the Bible. Theycan’t truly believe in God’s words, because otherwise they’d believe that homosexuality is a sin.” In fact, 80 percent of evangelical Protestants argued churches who do not believe homosexuality is sinful were misinterpreting or ignoring the Bible.Mississippi Christians who do not feel homosexuality is sinful, or at least not a major issue for Christians to deal with, hold similarly strong beliefs about churches who feel homosexuality is always wrong and preach about this issue as a major part of their 97                message. About a third (31.6 percent) of mainline Protestants explain they take issue with churches who overemphasize the issue of homosexuality. Mainline Protestants explainchurches they do agree with as: making sexuality iconic, overemphasizing the issue of sexuality, not acting Christian, being defensive, or being fearful of change. Victor, a mainline Protestant, explains:I think churches that do that overemphasize that part of what’s going on in society now when other social issues should be focused on like inequity and income and race and access to healthcare. And I think it’s easy to preach against something that you perceive to be a sin that someone else seems to be doing and not focusing on working on what your own shortcomings are and so I have a negative view ofthat. Kelsey, a mainline Protestant, expounds:I think that they are really getting manipulated by conservative republicans politics, by taking an issue that, not that it doesn’t affect everyone but that only taking a small percentage of the population and saying “well they’re the worstsinners”… why don’t we talk about sins that everybody does like greed, envy, slander, you know all that stuff?Previous research supports Kelsey’s claim that individuals’ religious beliefs are being directed toward opposition of gay and lesbian civil rights through ties with evangelical political organizations and the Republican Party (Sherkat et al. 2011).Similarly, 27.3 percent of Catholics believe other churches are causing more problems than they are solving by focusing so heavily on sexuality. When asked about churches that focus significant attention on homosexuality, one Catholic, Tracy, explains, 98                “It saddens me because I think it boils down to attacking individuals and it smacks of homophobia to me… It’s like we’re on the right side and you’re on the wrong side and I don’t think that’s what Jesus came to talk about.” Other Catholics who disagree explained they believed these churches were being judgmental, fearful, and divisive.Clearly, Christians are nowhere near a consensus on the issue of homosexuality.Both sides of this divide have fairly strong and negative opinions of the other. What this means for Christians is less clear, but we can safely say Mississippi Christians have verydifferent perspectives on the issue of homosexuality and how (or if) it should be addressed in their church or denomination.ConclusionOverall, there are contradictory opinions around the issue of homosexuality across different churches in Mississippi. Mississippi Christians’ views about homosexuality vary widely from complete rejection of gays and lesbians to complete acceptance. A review of the issues in this chapter also provides a clear indication that evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, and Catholic views on issue of homosexuality are divergent. In sum, evangelical Protestants only welcome gays and lesbians in order to change their sexuality and argue they cannot hold leadership positions. Catholics offer conditional acceptance to gays and lesbians in the Church.  Gays and lesbians should be welcomed as long as they keep their sexuality quiet and do not try to change the Church’s teachings.  Finally, mainline Protestants offer a more complete acceptance of gays and lesbians into the church. They argue it is not their place to judge and believe gays and lesbians should be allowed to hold leadership positions within their churches. 99                     This chapter clearly shows, evangelical Protestants are by and large the most conservative of Mississippi Christians. They seek to set themselves apart from the rest of the world by showing Christians are, or should be, different from others. Caleb clearly articulates the importance of Christians setting themselves apart from society and refusing to compromise when it comes to their beliefs. He says: To not acknowledge what the Bible says is to lie to God and lie to yourself… this may sound terrible but I think that a lot of churches are so worried about not offending someone… and they’re so worried about how many people are in attendance and showing them love, but that’s not true love I don’t think… There shouldn’t be compromise in the gospel; there shouldn’t be compromise in the beliefs of God. But there also shouldn’t be compromise in the way that we approach people with love.This supports Smith et al.’s (1998) thesis of subcultural identity theory. Evangelical beliefs about what the Bible and their church say about homosexuality continue to support an embattled identity which separates them from the rest of society. As Smith et al. (1998) explain, this allows evangelical Protestants to thrive as a religion because the distinction they feel in comparison to the rest of the population gives them an important identity marker. This is especially evident in the South where evangelical Protestants outnumber all other religious groups. On the opposite end of the spectrum, mainline Protestants continue to move towards full assimilation with secular society. Many mainline Protestants feel the Bible does not say anything about homosexuality and Christians must open their arms in love and acceptance to gays and lesbians. Finally,Catholics in Mississippi appear to fall somewhere in between evangelical and mainline 100              Protestants. Overall, they show more ambivalence surrounding the issue of homosexuality. Catholics neither fully accommodate with the larger society in the United States nor do they appear to be embattled by it. However, the Catholics in this sample appear to be leaning more towards mainline Protestant beliefs and accommodation of gays and lesbians than they do towards evangelical Protestants’ more conservative beliefs.All in all, these interviews show clearly views are changing and Mississippi Christians are struggling to understand the issue of homosexuality. Even evangelical Protestants, who the media has painted as wholly opposed to homosexuality, show some degree of unsureness and inconsistency in their answers. These findings make evident thoughts about this topic are shifting and being transformed in a time where gays andlesbians are at the forefront of media attention and political debates. This ambivalence and uncertainty becomes even more evident when it comes to gay and lesbian civil rights.The next chapter lays out the state of opinions on gay and lesbian civil rights among Mississippi Christians from differing denominations and churches.101                 CHAPTER V“ALL [WO]MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL”, OR ARE THEY?: GAY & LESBIAN CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATESMississippi Christians’ beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights (e.g. same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, right to serve openly in the military, etc.) are highly variable and ambivalent. Many of the responses seem contradictory and unsure when itcomes to what rights should be granted to gays and lesbians in the United States. Beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights fall broadly along a continuum from full acceptance tocomplete opposition. On one end of the continuum, respondents feel gays and lesbians should have full civil rights. Most respondents who fully support gay and lesbian civil rights feel homosexuality is not sinful and gays and lesbians should be treated equally. A few respondents who fully support gay and lesbian civil rights continue to feel homosexuality is sinful and against their religion, but argue for complete civil rights because they feel strongly religion should not influence politics in the United States. Those respondents who fall in the middle of the continuum indicate they accept somerights, such as teaching in public schools or serving in the military, while other rights such as marriage and adoption should be restricted to heterosexual couples. Finally, on the opposite end of the continuum, some respondents oppose most or all gay and lesbian civil rights. They believe recognition of any civil rights for this population indicates102                 acceptance of the “lifestyle” of gays and lesbians and teaches others being gay or lesbian is an acceptable way of life.It is important to understand how Mississippi Christians view gay and lesbian civil rights because discrimination and denial of equal rights for subgroups of a population lead to serious societal consequences. Social structure and policies in the United States continue to perpetuate sexual stigma and prejudice (Goffman 1963; Herek 2011). Herek (2011) explains sexual stigma against gays and lesbians continue to lead to oppression and disempower this population. Negative beliefs and attitudes have been proven to be dependable predictors of voting behaviors surrounding gay and lesbian policies (Herek 2000; Saucier and Cawman 2004). Additionally, those groups in opposition to gay and lesbian equality have continued to have disproportionate success in terms of passing legislation (McVeigh and Diaz 2009), at least until very recently.  In this chapter I look at the diversity and nuances in Mississippi Christians’ views toward gay and lesbian civil rights. I first provide an overview of where survey respondents fall on the issue of gay and lesbian civil rights in the United States. Then Ilook at how these beliefs vary based on the survey respondents’ religious identification.Following this description of the overall sample of Mississippi Christians, I turn to interview responses on three issues: same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and beliefs about the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. These three issues demonstrate the range of beliefs surrounding the topic of gay and lesbian civil rights. While the first two topics, same-sex marriage and adoption, refer to specific rights being sought by gays and lesbians in the United States, the third topic, the gay and lesbian civil rights movement refers to the social movement more generally. I show beliefs and attitudes toward same-103                       sex marriage and same-sex adoption fall largely along the lines of religious ideology.However, beliefs about the overall gay and lesbian civil rights movement seem less predictable based on religious categorization (although the extreme negative attitudes toward this movement continue to be held primarily by evangelical Protestants). While Mississippi Christians have formed more complete views and opinions about specific rights being sought by gays and lesbians, they hold more negative and ambiguous opinions and attitudes toward the gay and lesbian social movement for equality moregenerally.Gay & lesbian civil rights in the United StatesMississippi Christians’ views differ widely based on the specific right in question.Of the survey respondents from 13 churches across the state, I find variation from high support of gays and lesbians being protected by hate crime legislation to low support for the right of gays and lesbians to marry. Figure 1 provides an overview of Mississippi Christians’ beliefs about a number of gay and lesbian civil rights.104        Figure 1 Mississippi Christians’ beliefs about gay & lesbian civil rights           Overall, the majority (71.5 percent) of Mississippi Christians surveyed believegays and lesbians should be protected by hate-crime legislation making it one of the mostwidely supported civil rights of gays and lesbians in Mississippi. Not only do 71.5 percent of respondents agree with hate-crime legislation, 51.4 percent strongly agree. On the opposite extreme, 16 percent of Mississippi Christians surveyed continue to believe homosexuality should be illegal in the United States. Of those holding more restrictiveattitudes, approximately 30 percent agree gays and lesbians should not be allowed to teach school-aged children; a landlord should be allowed to refuse to rent a house or an apartment to somebody who is gay or lesbian; and if the military discovers a servicemember is gay or lesbian, the organization should be allowed to discharge them from105                      service. In sum, about a third of Mississippi Christians surveyed believe gays and lesbians should not be afforded any protection or access to civil rights in America.When we turn to the issue of whether gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, a civil rights issue that has been at the forefront of American conscience over the past decade, we see only minimal support. Unlike the United States at large, which reached a tipping point on the issue of same-sex marriage, only 30.3 percent of Mississippi Christians surveyed believe gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry.Almost half (45.8 percent) strongly disagree gays and lesbians should have the right tomarry. Similarly, 52.1 percent of survey respondents believe gays and lesbians should not be allowed to adopt children. In contrast, only a quarter of respondents (25.7 percent)strongly believe gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt children. Slightly morerespondents indicate they are accepting of same-sex marriage than those who supportsame-sex adoption.These statistics make sense when we consider of those surveyed 55.6 percent indicate the gay rights movement signifies a decline in morality in the United States.Along the same lines, 35 percent agree if the United States gives gays and lesbians the same rights as heterosexuals, then we will have to give rights to other ‘alternative lifestyles’ including incest, bestiality, and polygamy. Therefore, with over half ofrespondents believing gay and lesbian civil rights indicates a decline in morality and overa third believing it will lead to rights for other ‘alternative lifestyles’, it is clear Mississippi Christians continue to hold more opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights than the United States as a whole. The most recent Gallup Poll results from May 2014 indicate 55 percent of Americans believe same-sex marriage should be recognized as 106              Figure 2 Support for same-sex marriage & adoption by religious category  valid and granted the same rights as “traditional marriages” (Gallup 2014). Furthermore,beliefs and attitudes differ greatly based on respondents’ religious affiliation.Civil rights by religious affiliationAlthough the Mississippi Christians overall are more opposed to gay and lesbians civil rights than Americans in general, these findings vary depending on religious affiliation. Findings show evangelical Protestants are the most opposed to gay and lesbian civil rights while mainline Protestants are the least opposed. Figure 2 provides a visualization of support for same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption by religious category.107             As shown in the graph above, when asked if gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, 83.3 percent of evangelical Protestants indicate their disagreement. Of the Catholics surveyed, 63.6 percent also suggest gays and lesbian should not be allowed to marry in the United States. On the contrary, over half (55.6 percent) of mainline Protestants say they believe gays and lesbians should have the right to marry. These findings hold for adoption as well. Of the mainline Protestants surveyed, 63.6 percent indicate they believe gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt children in the United States. Only 30.3 percent of Catholics and two percent of evangelical Protestants agree gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt children. Most (63.6 percent) evangelical Protestants strongly disagree with gay and lesbian adoption.Catholics’ responses fall between evangelical Protestants and mainline Protestants, however, for this sample Catholics’ opinions were more closely aligned with evangelical Protestants’ views of gay and lesbian civil rights than with mainline Protestant views. This is important to note because the opposite seems to be true when interview responses are analyzed, a point I will discuss shortly. When Catholics are forced to place themselves in a box or check the best answer that applies their answers appear to be far more conservative than when they have a chance to explain in detail their thoughts on a subject. In reality, Catholics’ answers are far more ambiguous and complex than the survey tool was able to capture. Therefore, I now turn to the interview data to try to provide a more complete picture of how Mississippi Christians feel about gay and lesbian civil rights.108                         Making sense of gay & lesbian civil rightsHow Mississippi Christians make sense of these beliefs is an important part of this project. Why do mainline Protestants largely agree gays and lesbians should be granted the right to marry and adopt children, while most Catholics and evangelical Protestants do not? Interview respondents were given the chance to expand on their beliefs and justify their position in regards to gay and lesbian civil rights. Similar to theirdiscussion of what the Bible and their church says about homosexuality, Mississippi Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward gay and lesbian civil rights are far more complex than survey responses indicate. Here I examine how interviewees make sense of theirbeliefs about certain gay and lesbian civil rights. Although respondents discuss beliefsabout many issues surrounding gay and lesbian civil rights, the most intricate and elaborate responses were in regards to three topics: same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. During interviews, most respondents agreed gays and lesbians should be protected from hate-crimes, allowed to teach in public schools, and serve openly in the military, however, when it came to marriage, adoption, and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement in general their responses were highly varied and complex. As you will see, the ambiguity and difficulty respondents had speaking about these issues indicate they are often conflicted about theirideas and their views are in the process of change, even as the respondents speak. I will now consider each of these three issues in turn showing the complexity and uncertainnessthat surrounded many responses.109        Figure 3 Interview responses to support for same-sex marriage      Same-sex marriageOpinions of same-sex marriage seem to fall within three different camps: first, those who are opposed to same-sex marriage, including civil unions; second, those who fully support same-sex marriage; and third, those who support gays and lesbians receiving the benefits of marriage, but oppose it being called marriage. The break down based on religious category is depicted in Figure 3. The majority of evangelical Protestants (60 percent) fall into the first camp.Andrew explains this opposition to same-sex marriage. He says:In other societies there have been homosexual and lesbian relationships, but it's never been called marriage. I think to redefine basic human relationships isdifferent than letting people have relationships that they want, but to redefine 110                    marriage, I think is a problem....you're losing the foundation of society... weakening the foundation of a community. Another evangelical Protestant, Erica, explains same-sex marriage is “just another waythat the nation is going against God’s will and it leads to death.” When asked if she would support same-sex civil union she responds, “I couldn’t, I don’t think, because then tax payer’s money and all of those things would be going against what God says.” Other evangelicals, such as Frances, explain they oppose same-sex marriage because it would add to the “downward spiral” of marriage or it would lead down a “pathway” of destruction. For instance, Angela explains: God is not going to allow the sin to continue like it is going, and if our country votes to let gays and lesbians be able to get married and all this mess then it’s justanother slap in God’s face and I mean he’s going to put his hand down and say, you know ‘enough is enough and you’ve turned your back on me enough’, and he will call those home who have accepted him and he will let the others go where they have chosen to go… I mean it’s like [the world] is going to be destroyed… because when God made the world and he said that marriage is between a man and a woman, it’s not between you know two men or two women.Even though most evangelical respondents agreed same-sex marriage should be strongly opposed, two evangelical respondents did fall into the second camp. These respondents felt marriage in our society is no longer sacred and the state has no right to control an individual’s choices. Caleb explains, “My marriage, the promise that I made to my wife, the covenant that I made before God, really has nothing to do with American 111                     government. That’s just a tax rate write off. So yeah, I see no problem with homosexuals being allowed to get married in America.”Those most supportive of same-sex marriage are mainline Protestants. Fifteen outof the 19 mainline Protestants (78.9 percent) express complete support of same-sex marriage. Only one mainline Protestant interviewee expressed complete opposition. The remaining three explain they do not believe it should be called marriage, but gays and lesbians should have rights equal to those of heterosexual couples. Many mainline Protestant respondents describe the benefits of allowing gays and lesbians to marry. Jason explains same-sex marriage would bring about positive change in this country, especially when it comes to “taxes and equality.” Victor agrees same-sex marriage would lead to “significant economic benefits.” He continues, “And I think within a few years it will be much more accepted than it is now, just like interracial marriage was a generation or two ago…but now not many people think very much about it.” Kelsey’s idea of the benefits of same-sex marriage is more ideological, she states, “I do think [same-sex marriage] might promote marriage. I think it might strengthen people's opinion of actually getting married... I feel like people are realizing it's not really that big of a deal.” Finally, other mainline Protestants explain they support same-sex marriage because it will make it easier for gays and lesbians to adopt children if their relationships are legally recognized and in turn make it easier on the children of same-sex parents.Over half (54.5 percent) of Catholics fall into the third camp; they believe gays and lesbians deserve legal protections and benefits, but cannot bring themselves to call itmarriage. One Catholic, Brenda, explains: 112                 I struggle with that. I think that there should be some inherent rights preserved for traditional family… I can't say I'm opposed to marriage but I think, again going back to Christianity and maybe the Bible, that marriage is something that should be reserved for husband and wife for the sake of having children, biological children... [gays and lesbians] can do what they do but you know being that I'm a taxpayer and supportive of all the insurance things, you know I think marriage still probably, as an institution, should be reserved for heterosexual couples for the true purpose of having biological children.Brenda is supportive of civil unions and the benefits of marriage being applied equally to gays and lesbians, but believes the institution of marriage is reserved for heterosexualcouples. Along the same lines, another Catholic, Peter, says:To me marriage is a very specific thing and I don’t think marriage as I believe in marriage and understand marriage, I don’t think that applies to people of the same sex. So I believe that they should be allowed to form civil unions, which is a word that I’ve read a lot in recent history that I think I somewhat understand and agree with. They’re free to choose the way they want to live any way they want to live. But to elevate that union to the same level as a covenantal relationship in marriage, I don’t think they’re the same thing. There really is a difference, but they’re free to live however they choose.Catholics’ insistence that same-sex marriage should not be allowed, but that same-sex couples deserve some form of legal recognition seems to be directly tied to their belief in marriage as one of the seven sacraments in the Catholic Church. Susan most clearly articulates this point. She explains:113                    I think that there could be civil laws that would cover any kind of civil union. Ijust feel like marriage is a sacrament and I know that that’s getting religion mixed up in politics and public life and all, but I just feel like for centuries marriage has been a sacrament, and it’s been understood that way and it should stay that way. But I don’t think that there’s any reason why we can’t have civil union laws that would you know meet the requirements that homosexuals would need for legal status.However, some Catholics disagree with this sentiment. Two Catholic respondentswere completely opposed to same-sex marriage while three were completely supportive.Kristina’s answer on this question seems to mirror evangelical Protestant’s answers more closely than other Catholics. When asked if gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry she says no, because:In God’s aspect, and the religious aspect of it that’s just one more way that we are falling away from God and falling away from the morality that he set forth for usnot only to function in a worshipping community but as a functioning society. You know first it’s okay to marry the same sex. Second, it’s okay to, I don’t know do the purge day… [one day a year you can commit any crime that you want to commit]. You now I just think that it opens a gateway into making anything and everything that we want to do ok and that’s just not what God wants for us.Overall, when it comes to the issue of same-sex marriage we begin to see the ambivalence and struggle Christians today have in reconciling their religious beliefs and the changing social and political values around them. Here we also begin to see clearlyhow subcultural identities (Smith et al. 1998) shape respondents’ answers. Evangelical 114                         Protestants stand on one end of the spectrum fighting to maintain the boundaries that setthem apart from the rest of the world, while on the other end of the spectrum mainline Protestants have almost completely assimilated into the larger culture around them(Smith et al. 1998; Wellman 2008). This overall trend of acceptance also holds for the issue of same-sex adoption to which I now turn.Same-sex adoptionThe issue of same-sex adoption appears to be even more complex than marriageto Mississippi Christians. Many who oppose same-sex marriage nonetheless supportsame-sex adoption, even if they do not find it ideal. Like beliefs about same-sex marriage, beliefs about same-sex adoption fall broadly into three camps. The first group of respondents indicate full acceptance of same-sex adoption. This group does not feelsame-sex adoption will be detrimental for children or it will affect the child’s sexuality.The second group is completely opposed to the idea of same-sex adoption indicating itwill harm the children and make them more likely to identify as gay or lesbian when they grow up. Other respondents fall somewhere in the middle on this issue. This group feelssame-sex adoption is not an ideal situation; however, they support it because they feel itis better than a child having no parents. Again these groups were generally divided along the lines of religious identity. Mainline Protestants show support for same-sex adoption, evangelical Protestants are overall opposed to same-sex adoption and Catholics fall somewhere in between.Of the 19 mainline Protestants interviewed all but three indicated full acceptance of same-sex adoption. Only one mainline Protestant was opposed to same-sex adoption and two indicated it was not an ideal situation. Most mainline Protestants agree with 115             Isabelle who says she’s fine with same-sex adoption; “There are so many children that need homes and if they’re willing to give a child a home, I don’t know why not.” Another mainline Protestant, Kelsey, agrees gays and lesbians should have the right to adopt children. When asked what effect she believes this will have on children she explains, “[children] will probably be a lot more affirming of who they are and they’ll feel a lot more free to be themselves you know. But I don’t think that it’s going to like create more gay kids or whatever.”Despite their acceptance of same-sex adoption, some mainline Protestants still raise concerns. For example, Barbara explains she does not have a problem with same-sex adoption because there are a lot of children that need a good home and “I think always err on the side of love.” However, she goes on to say that she is against in-vitro fertilization because parents are consciously choosing to deprive their child of the opposite sex parent:I believe the best option for a family unit is to have a male and female and children. Because I think each person, each sex adds to the equation because males are different, females are different and each one um, adds to the family unitin a way that the other one cannot… they would miss the characteristics that are inherent in the sex they’re missing… I would assume in a same sex marriage there would be some disruption of those normal patterns of families.So while Barbara would vote in favor of legalizing same-sex adoption, it is clear she does not think same-sex parents are the ideal families for children and in an “ideal world” this would not be necessary. Clearly, the issue of in-vitro fertilization and adoption of two 116                   separate issues, but Barbara’s opposition to in-vitro elucidates her views on same-sex parenting as less than ideal.In addition to this type of qualification around acceptance, the primary issue mainline Protestants raised about same-sex adoption is the child may be picked on by other children or other children’s parents. This is one point they tended to agree on withboth evangelical Protestants and Catholics. All three groups said “children can be cruel.”However, for mainline Protestants this was not enough of a justification to disallow same-sex couples to adopt.Eighty percent (8 out of 10) of the evangelical Protestants interviewed describe a complete opposition to same-sex adoption. The only two evangelical Protestants who were not completely opposed still held this was not an ideal situation for children.Andrew clearly sums up the argument of those who oppose same-sex adoption. He explains:I think again [same-sex adoption] is redefining basic community terms. Children are a product of man and woman coming together… I think it’s disjointed emotionally, physiologically; it’s like wanting the benefit of the union of man and women but not wanting to unify men and women. Children come about from men and women coming together… I think [same-sex adoption] will confuse sexual identity [for children].Along the same lines, Candace tells me she is against same-sex adoption. She states:We learn from our parents… you’ve got a female who’s trying to fill the role of a father then I just don’t believe there’s any way that that person can adequately do that, especially if they have a son or even a daughter, because the daughter’s 117                        relationship with her father is so key as far as how she will look for a husband and how she will even treat her husband when she gets married… I think it opens the door for confusion.Erica concurs same-same parents raising children is “not God’s best” and will lead to confusion. Regina elaborates on this explaining children will not know if they are “supposed to be masculine or feminine” if they are raised by same-sex couples. She explains if gays and lesbians are allowed to adopt they are “going to do more damage to that child and it’s a selfish move.” Likewise, Darlene argues against same-sex adoption.She explains by “choosing” a homosexual relationship, gays and lesbians “give up that natural right” to have children. Only one evangelical Protestant interviewed agreed that gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt; however, he explains this is only from apolitical standpoint – the government should not be allowed to interfere in such personal decisions. As a religious persons, “I would want [same-sex adoption] not to happen,”says Caleb.Catholics primarily fell into the middle camp on the issue of same-sex adoption.Seven out of 11 Catholics interviewed (63.6 percent) explain same-sex adoption is notideal and place restrictions on same-sex couples who wish to adopt children. However, despite Catholics’ belief that same-sex adoption is not ideal, no Catholic interviewees arecompletely opposed to same-sex adoption or indicated they would vote against it. Thissentiment is parallel to Catholics placing conditions on gays and lesbians who hold leadership positions in the Church. Many of the Catholics interviewed are committed to conditional inclusion; they place conditions which gays and lesbians must meet before they qualify for the same rights as their heterosexual peers.118                   As Hillary explains, “If this was a perfect society where everybody had a momand dad then we wouldn’t need that,” but she goes on to explain since this is not a perfect society and children need family she would accept gays and lesbians adopting children.Catholics feel sympathy for children who need a home, but temper their full acceptance of same-sex adoption with things they feel gays and lesbians should do if they adoptchildren. For example, Brenda tells me gays and lesbians should “not push their homosexual values” on children and they must ensure they have an opposite sex influence in their lives. She says: I don’t have a problem with [same-sex adoption] really, especially given all the kids that need good homes. I really don’t. Again as long as they don’t try to push their homosexual values on them... I would also hope that if it was a male or female couple they would try to bring other outside influences, other family members whoever so that the child if it was a male child [who] had two moms [he] could be exposed to the male you know genre.Whitney agrees same-sex adoption is acceptable, but once more adds a stipulation - “as long as two same-sex parents ensured that child had exposure to a good opposite sex role model. Because I think we drive so much as people you know to have a female influenceand a male influence. You become a little more holistic person.”Peter’s answer shows the uncertainty that characterized many Catholics’ opinions about gay and lesbian civil rights. Although ultimately he disagrees with other Catholics that gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt, he is very torn and has difficultyexplaining why he feels the way he does. Peter explains: 119                That’s a really hard question. I don’t know that I’ve come to any… clear cut direction on that question because I’m torn like a dichotomy here. I see the sense of compassion for how many of the kids that really need to be adopted there are in this world and I guess I need to know more about that particular issue. But I just don’t know. That’s a hard one for me to answer. Although my inclination withoutmaking any kind of clear cut choice, my inclination is to say no. My inclination is to believe that it wouldn’t be good for the kid long term. It might provide a home, it might provide some security. But I don’t know that it’s going to provide… the kind of psychological and emotional growth that a person needs to really be whole, I guess… I think that what I just talked about is pretty much the crux of it. I think there’s a, I like the word I just used “whole”. I think there is a wholenessto a man and a woman in a marital relationship versus you know two partners of the same sex… but one just seems more whole than the other, fuller than the other. And why settle for so much less when there is so much more?On the other hand, Rick, a Catholic, believes gays and lesbians should be allowed to adopt, because “everybody's screwed up to some extent. I screw up my kids… Every parent screws up their kid to some extent.” Likewise, Tracy, who does not agree with same-sex marriage, explains same-sex couples should have the right to adopt because “studies have shown that children in a homosexual, stable, loving household are just as well off as kids in heterosexual, stable, loving households, and better than kids in other situations.” Although views about same-sex marriage and adoption seem complicated, answers become even more convoluted when respondents discuss their views of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement.120            The gay & lesbian civil rights movementThis third topic, the gay and lesbian civil rights movement, gave rise to strong feelings and opinions. While same-sex marriage and adoption are specific rights being fought for within the gay and lesbian civil rights movement, this topic was more general referring to the social movement at large. Interviewees were asked to explain their thoughts about the movement; whether they thought it was having a positive or negative influence on society; and whether they thought the movement influenced children. As expected, the answers range from completely positive views of the movement to opinions that the movement will lead to disastrous consequences. Across the board, many Mississippi Christians agreed the movement is divisive and could be more productive if it were carried out in a different way. Peter, a Catholic, tells me he feels the movement is “creating polarization more and more and that's never going to be the answer.”Although answers do not fall as neatly along religious identification as the issues of same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption, a trend still emerges. Like in most other issues discussed to this point, evangelical Protestants hold the most negative opinions, Catholics are more indecisive, and mainline Protestants show more support for gay and lesbians issues. In total, all but one evangelical Protestant interviewed argued the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is bad for society. The only evangelical Protestant who did not describe the movement in negative terms says she does not know enough about it to speak on the topic. Catholics were divided on this topic. Out of the 11 Catholics interviewed, 18.2 percent explain some aspects of the movement are positive while othersare negative. About a quarter (27.3 percent) suggests the movement will have only positive influences on society. On the other hand, approximately a third (36.4 percent) 121               describes the gay and lesbian civil rights movement as negative. Finally, two out of the 11 Catholics do not know what effects the movement will have on society. Only one out of 19 mainline Protestants described the movement in completely negative terms. Over half (57.9) of mainline Protestants only discuss positive benefits of the movement, while 21.1 percent explain the movement will have both positive and negative consequences.Three mainline Protestants say they do not know what effects the movement will have in the United States.For those who believe the movement has both positive and negative consequences, most appreciate the need for the civil rights movement, but feel it crosses the line when it tries to impinge on their religious beliefs. Therefore, they support the fight for equal rights under the law, but when gays and lesbians seek to have equal recognition within their church or denomination some Mississippi Christians draw theline. Ervin, a mainline Protestant, held this view. He states, “If you're pursuing something civilly I have no beef against that… but if you're talking about other aspects of the movement in terms of you know an acceptance, or if you're talking about the fight against the church's perspective then I would be on the other side of that line.”Additionally, some respondents have concerns about what this movement means for children in the United States. For example, a Catholic, Brenda, says she supports part of the gay and lesbian movement, however, “I don't know if we need to bring it down to the high school levels, as far as this gay alliance movement... We don't have heterosexual movements in schools, the gay and bi alliances aren’t necessary at a high school level.”In the same way, Ervin and others explain this movement will cause children to be moreopen to homosexuality as an “easy alternative.” Lauren, an evangelical Protestant, 122                  expands on this sentiment, “from what I've noticed around here, a lot of younger people are choosing to become homosexual and sometimes it scares me because they're so young. I feel like they're influenced by their schools… sometimes I wonder if it's morelike teen smoking, it's cool to do it.”Nevertheless, there are a number of Mississippi Christians, predominately evangelical Protestants, who feel the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is sign of disaster on the horizon. Sixty percent of evangelical respondents used the terminology dangerous, detrimental, or extreme when discussing the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. To the contrary, no mainline Protestants used these terms and only two Catholics discussed the movement using the similar terms of “militant” and “scary.”Erica, an evangelical Protestant, explains she understands why gays and lesbians are fighting, but even though she cannot think of a specific example, she is sure “the more you go down that road it’s going to lead to more and more destruction.” Darlene, an evangelical Protestant, believes the movement will lead to “more extreme groups would want to get rights, like, you know, polygamist or pedophiles.” Candace, another evangelical Protestant, explains we are entering a “dangerous season.” She says:I feel like we're really entering a real dangerous season because it seems like the direction they want to go is making it illegal for me to express my belief on that lifestyle and how I believe it's unhealthy... I've sure watched a lot of pressure being applied to companies like Chick-Fil-A and I can only believe that if this keeps going on like this, you know we won't be able to stand on what we believe is true.123                  In her interview, Candace displays great fear due to the gay and lesbian civil rights movement that she will no longer be allowed to express her religious beliefs. She feels if things keep progressing towards equality for gays and lesbians she will eventually end up in prison for her belief that gays and lesbians are living a “lifestyle” of sin. She is not alone in these beliefs, David, an evangelical Protestant, explains the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is:… detrimental to the US. I think it's detrimental to any society. They're wishing to demand special privileges for a class of people and economically speaking thelesbian, gay section of the country make much higher salaries on average than the normal heterosexuals do. So to say that they are a class that's being discriminated against economically is a bunch of bologna. David believes gays and lesbians are not fighting for equality; rather they are fighting to have more rights than heterosexuals. As a point of clarification, gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are more likely to live in poverty in the United States than are heterosexual people as confirmed by a study by The Williams Institute (Badgett, Durso, and Schneebaum 2013). (This argument is similar to the arguments made by anti-feminists against feminism or whites against racial equality.) Another evangelical Protestant, Regina, shows her degree of frustration with the movement in her comments. She rants, “I'm tired of getting it stuffed down my throat… So you're homosexual. Does that give you a special class? You're saying like ‘I'm special.’ You're just like anybody else. It amazes me. I really can't get over that.” Finally, one evangelical Protestant, Angela, even goes as far as to suggest the movement is another indication the end times are near. She explains:124               I feel that things that happen to this nation like earthquakes and hurricanes and all of that kind of stuff, I feel like that God allows those things to happen because he’s trying to get our attention and so I feel like that some of those things would be happening just like how Katrina hit New Orleans and almost wiped it out. You know, God was trying to get the people in New Orleans attention and the people down on the coast. So I think some of those things would continue happening.After this statement I asked if Angela was referring to indications of the end times discussed in the Bible and she confirmed that is what she means.Another point of contention among interviewees was whether the gay and lesbian civil rights movement was similar to the African American’s civil rights movement of the 1960s. I did not directly ask if respondents felt the gay and lesbians civil rights movement is similar to movements of the past, however, nine out of the 40 respondents spontaneously mentioned the civil rights movement of the 1960s. A little over a fifth of mainline Protestants (21.1 percent) suggest the movement is the same or similar to theAfrican American civil rights movement. One Catholic agreed with this comparison.Isabelle, a mainline Protestant who identifies as African American, tells me she believes gays and lesbians are “piggy-backing on the civil rights from the 60s with, you know, the black issue and having the freedom to be able to have equal access to everything. I think if they don't speak out, they won't be heard… I would hope that we could all live here as human beings and respect each other.” Kelsey, a white mainline Protestant, agrees with Isabelle that the movement is similar to the racial civil rights movement of the 1960s and it gives her a “really joyful, hopeful feeling.” Finally, Leo, another white mainline Protestant, explains, “I wish it weren't necessary but it's time… if Martin Luther King125                     was with us he'd be saying okay, it's time to hit the repeat button. Doing it in a nonviolentmanner, but doing it as a form of teaching the evolution of society, and just making it okay.”On the other side of the aisle are those who feel this movement is not as difficult or serious as the African American civil rights movement. One Catholic respondent, one mainline Protestant respondent, and two evangelical Protestant respondents, all of whomare white, tell me comparing the gay and lesbian civil rights movement to the African American civil rights movement is problematic at best. One Catholic, Rick, says he feels gays and lesbians are not “going to have as much struggle or at least I hope they’re not going to have as much struggle as African Americans did… I mean it’s more of a ‘Hi,we’re here’ kind of thing which I think is a good thing. I mean I think we’ve progressed a lot.” In a more negative manner, one evangelical Protestant, Caleb, tries to explain he is not concerned with the movement or American culture, but his answer indicates his level of frustration with the gay and lesbian movement, and especially with it being compared to the African American movement of the 1960s. He says:I think it's slightly ridiculous because I don't want to say they have an agenda but it feels like that sometimes because I am a straight heterosexual conservative Christian that I feel like I'm looked at as ignorant because of it sometimes. Also the fact that they compare themselves to the civil rights movement of the 1960s I'm kind of offended by that because in that case there were open hangings of black people. There were riots in the street where police were setting dogs on people and spraying them down with water hoses. I don't see that happening to gay people in America. So I don't like the extremism that they take in comparing 126                        themselves to the civil rights movement of the 60s, but if they feel strongly about it then by all means. I'm not concerned with the culture of America per say.As previously mentioned, feelings about the gay and lesbian civil rights movement seem more varied even within one of the three broad categories of evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, and Catholic. For instance, one mainline Protestant,Jason, who was fully supportive of same-sex marriage and adoption, had negative feelings about the civil rights movement more generally. He explains: I have some resistance… I don't want to use the word flaunting, but I don't flauntmy sexuality… Public displays, phallics and that sort of stuff, I'm opposed to thatkind of glorification. I would want you to have equal rights. I would want you to be able to be married and have a partner… [but] I think it's superfluous and I think it denigrates... and sexualizes it more than it's necessary.As this comment suggests, it seems a lot of resistance to the gay and lesbian civil rights movement stems from the fact it is fully conflated with the gay pride movement and parades.When people hear the term gay and lesbian civil rights movement they often think of what is to them eccentric or even offensive parades. In addition to using the termflaunting, respondents explain they feel the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is too outlandish. They describe feeling like gay and lesbian rights are being “stuffed down their throat” or they are “slapped upside the head” with gay and lesbian sexuality. For example, when I asked Hillary, a Catholic, for her views about the movement she explains to me how she asked her brother, who is gay, “‘why do you guys have to be so flamboyant?’, you know, ‘why do you have to go out there and have this parade, and 127                            dress weird, color your hair weird?’. I said ‘if anything it just makes you look like you're weird’... I just wish they would keep quiet about it and go about their own business. I don't go out there and advertise my sexual relationships.” Another Catholic, Susan, agrees “some demonstrations and stuff for gay civil rights and stuff are just so outlandishly out there. It's just like, you feel slapped upside the head with it.”Clearly, there are some extremely negative beliefs about and attitudes towards the gay and lesbian civil rights movement in the United States. Only 35 percent of respondents overall describe the movement in a completely positive way. Exactly the same about of respondents believe the movement is fully negative and detrimental to the United States. Even many of those who support gay and lesbian civil rights take issue with the movement, or at least how it has been framed.ConclusionIn sum, Mississippi Christians are divided over what rights gays and lesbiansshould be entitled to. Answers suggest unsureness and shifting opinions toward gay and lesbian civil rights. However, with the issue of civil rights we see the same pattern emerge as when respondents are asked how their church should deal with the issue of homosexuality. Generally, mainline Protestants advocate complete and equal civil rights for gays and lesbians in the United States. Catholics offer a conditional acceptance of gay and lesbian civil rights. While many Catholics still feel homosexuality is sinful, they hold that gays and lesbians should be treated fairly. They seek to grant gays and lesbians civilrights, but continue to place limitations on these rights to try to align them with theirconservative religious views. Finally, evangelical Protestants largely oppose all gay and lesbian civil rights and feel threatened by these rights.128                           Mainline Protestants indicate support of gay and lesbian civil rights and, as described in Chapter IV, mainline Protestants’ answers line up more closely with secular society. As Smith et al. (1998) describe, these respondents’ answers show engagement with society, but not distinction from it. The do not place conditions on gay and lesbian civil rights and are more likely to argue that the gay and lesbian civil rights movement has positive benefits for society. Their religion is not used in any way to distinguish themfrom gays and lesbians or to justify different rights for themselves that gays and lesbiansare not entitled to.Catholics’ answers also show their engagement with society, however, they have a higher level of distinction from secular society than mainline Protestants. Catholics are torn on how to approach gay and lesbian civil rights. Most Catholics indicate the desire to grant gays and lesbians equality, nevertheless, they also wish to hold onto the conservative teachings of the Catholic Church with indicates the act of homosexuality is sinful. In line with Konieczny’s (2013) study, I find when Catholics strongly believe they must uphold the Church’s teachings they are more likely to oppose same-sex marriage, and gay and lesbian civil rights more generally. Catholics’ competing ideologies, desire for equality along with the conservative teachings of the Catholic Church, often lead respondents to a place of conditional acceptance. Like in the Church where they placeconditions on gays and lesbians in leadership positions, Catholics take the middle road on gay and lesbian civil rights. Often they support civil unions, but not marriage in the Church. They support same-sex adoption, but place conditions on how gay and lesbian parents should raise their children. Finally, they are divided on whether the gay and lesbian civil rights movement has a positive or negative influence on society. 129                          Finally, when it comes to the issue of gay and lesbian civil rights, evangelicalProtestants again show a high level of engagement with but distinction from secular society (Smith et al. 1998). In this sample, they indicate almost complete opposition to same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement.They strive to set themselves apart from gays and lesbians. The issues surrounding gayand lesbian civil rights are used as a boundary to protect their embattled Christianidentity. They describe great fear and concern about what gay and lesbian civil rights means for society. Whether this concern is minor or means the end of time is near, mostevangelical Protestants remove themselves from gays and lesbians and even from thosewho are supportive of gay and lesbian equality. This finding is in line with previousresearch that shows evangelical Protestants are more likely to condemn homosexuality, more likely to hold prejudicial attitudes towards gays and lesbians, and less likely to support gay and lesbian civil rights (Duck and Hunsberger 1999; Hill et al. 2010; Sherkat et al. 2011; Bramlett 2012). Now the task at hand is to determine what may change or soften these views and make evangelical Protestants more open to gay and lesbian equality. Previous research reviewed in Chapter III indicates knowing someone who is gay or lesbian should have the effect of overcoming these negative perceptions and attitudes towards gay and lesbian civil rights. The next chapter examines how social contact with gays and lesbians influences Mississippi Christians’ views about gay and lesbian civil rights. Specifically, I attempt to examine if having a gay or lesbian family member or friend changes perceptions about the issues discussed to this point.130                     CHAPTER VISOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS ARE GAY… THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIALCONTACT ON MISSISSIPPI CHRISTIANS’ VIEWS TOWARD HOMOSEXUALITYAs social identity theorists argue, social groups are made up of individuals who share some sort of social identification and view themselves as part of a social category (Hogg & Abrams 1988). This feeling of likeness leads to ingroup membership and the othering of those in outgroups (Hogg & Abrams 1988). Individuals define their own identity based on the groups they belong to and those social categories from our larger social structure.Smith et al. (1998) use this idea of social comparison to develop a theory ofsubcultural identity. They show how Christians, specifically evangelical Protestants, use their religion as a foundation of their social identity. Evangelical Protestants compare themselves to other outgroups which enables them to thrive. Although mainline Protestants and Catholics also engage in this process of social comparison, they use theirreligious identity to a lesser degree than evangelicals to distinguish them from otheroutgroups. Smith et al. (1998) explain mainline Protestants lose their distinctiveness fromthe rest of society because they focus on engaging with outgroups, rather than differentiating themselves from those groups. Finally, Catholics fall somewhere in between evangelical Protestants and mainline Protestants; while most liberal Catholics 131                        appear to face the same dilemma as mainline Protestants, engagement-without-distinction, more conservative Catholics seek some form of distinction. As previously shown, the difference is conservative Catholics in Mississippi appear to be moreconcerned about distinguishing themselves as good Catholics, rather than distinguishing themselves from non-Catholic outgroups. They focus more on shaping their identitiesbased on Church teachings, rather than shaping their identities in comparison to the outgroup, in this case gays and lesbians.Social contact theorists suggest contact between members of different groups hasthe ability to overcome prejudice and lead to more positive beliefs and attitudes towardoutgroup members (Allport 1954). A large body of research has indicated social contactbetween Christians and gays and lesbians reduces negative beliefs and attitudes towards outgroup members. However, when considering a subgroup of the Christian population, some research has raised questions about the effectiveness of social contact in overcoming conservative religious beliefs about homosexuality (Lewis 2011; Bramlett 2012; Baker and Brauner-Otto 2014).  In this chapter, I explain how religious identity and social contact work together or in opposition to overcome negative beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Does subcultural identity, especially among conservative Christians, outweigh the positive effects of social contact? Is conservative religious identity a negative feature (Pettigrew & Tropp 2006) that prevents social contact fromovercoming prejudice? Or is close social contact enough to overcome conservative religious beliefs that condemn homosexuality? Finally, if social contact is not sufficient 132                     for overcoming negative beliefs and attitudes, does this lead to cognitive dissonance and, if so, how do Christians overcome this dissonance?For the purposes of this research, I define social contact as any communication between Mississippi Christians and those gays and lesbians they identify as friends orfamily members. Although I acknowledge various degrees of contact have differing effects, I argue any communication combined with the acknowledgement of relationships with gays and lesbians should be sufficient to decrease prejudice and lead to morepositive beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality. While the majority of respondents indicate contact with gay and lesbian significant others is limited to face-to-face communication and talking via telephone, some respondents also stay in contact withtheir gay or lesbian friend or family member through email or other social media (i.e. Facebook). One interesting finding is some Christians, especially conservative Catholics, who fall in the middle on issues of homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights face some level of cognitive dissonance. The theory of cognitive dissonance suggests people feel psychological discomfort when they are faced with two conflicting realities (Festinger1957; Mahaffy 1996). The cognitive dissonance I examine here is the clash between individuals’ religious beliefs and values, believing homosexuality is sinful and wrong, and their behaviors, loving and spending time with people who identify as gay or lesbian.While this dichotomy did not lead to cognitive dissonance for all respondents, some interviewees expressed sincere discomfort and struggle with merging these two realities.Previous research has examined the cognitive dissonance between Christian beliefs and homosexuality for women who identify as lesbian (Mahaffy 1996). Mahaffy 133                  (1996) finds lesbians are more likely to experience cognitive dissonance, a struggle tomerge their Christian beliefs and sexuality, if they identified as evangelical prior to (or even after) coming out. I argue this can be expanded to individuals who identified withconservative Christian beliefs prior to their relationships with a gay or lesbian family member or friend. That is, respondents who hold more conservative Christian beliefs prior to social contact with a friend or family member they know to be gay or lesbian may experience higher levels of cognitive dissonance between their religious identity and their behaviors of caring about a person who identifies as gay or lesbian. There are three primary ways to overcome cognitive dissonance: changing the behavior that leads to dissonance, add new cognitions to reduce or eliminate dissonance, or change the social environment that causes dissonance (Festinger 1957; Mahaffy 1996). Additionally, there is the option to live with or ignore the dissonance which appears to be the choice of many conservative Christians, especially evangelical Protestants. I now turn to the surveys to provide an overview of the amount of social contact with gays and lesbians reported by Mississippi Christians. Then, in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of these relationships, I examine data from in-depth interviews. I am specifically interested in how Mississippi Christians make sense out of their relationships with gays and lesbians and their religious beliefs and identities simultaneously. The interviews allow the reader to see more closely how respondents struggle with this topic and attempt to make sense of what seems, at least on the surface, as competing and contradictory identities.134                      Social contact between Mississippi Christians and gays & lesbiansOnly 8.3 percent of Mississippi Christians surveyed indicate they do not knowanyone who identifies as gay or lesbian. The majority (61.8 percent) say they have at least one friend who is gay or lesbian. Of those with a gay or lesbian friend about half (48.9 percent) indicate they spend time with this friend(s) at least once a month. Over athird (36.4 percent) of respondents say they spend time with their gay or lesbian friend(s)a couple times a year. However, 14.8 percent who say they have a friend who is gay orlesbian suggest they never spend time with this friend(s).In addition to social contact with gays and lesbians via friendship, 35.4 percent of those surveyed disclose they have a gay and/or lesbian family member(s). Of those, 15.7 percent have an immediate family member who identifies as gay or lesbian. That is, their parent, child, or sibling is gay or lesbian. About a fifth (20.1 percent) of respondents have a gay or lesbian cousin. Finally, 8.4 percent state they have a niece, nephew, aunt, or uncle who is gay or lesbian. The amount of time spent with a gay or lesbian family member appears to be even less than that spent with gay and lesbian friends. The vastmajority of respondents who have a gay or lesbian family member reveal they only see this family member a couple times a year or less (90.2 percent). Only 9.8 percent of those with a gay or lesbian family member indicate they have contact with this family memberonce a month or more.Overall, most Mississippi Christians at least know someone who is gay or lesbian, but there is a wide range in the amount of social contact they actually have with people who identify as gay or lesbian. One important aspect to consider is whether the amount of 135              social contact differs based on religious ideology. Do evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, or Catholics have more or less contact with people who are gay or lesbian?Social contact based on religious identityWhile 75 percent of Catholics and 80 percent of mainline Protestants state they have a gay or lesbian friend, less than half (48.7 percent) of evangelical Protestants claimto have a gay or lesbian friend. When it comes to family members, evangelical Protestants, mainline Protestants, and Catholics report similar numbers of relationships with gays and lesbians. Therefore, this implies the evangelical Protestants surveyed were different in some way when it came to chosen social contact. They were much less likely to have friends who were gay or lesbian, which is a choice, whereas, having gay or lesbian family member is not a choice. The question then is whether evangelical Protestants hold more negative views about gays and lesbians because they have less social contact, or do their negative views lead them to have less social contact with gays and lesbians? How does social contact influence beliefs and opinions about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights for Mississippi Christians? I now turn to interview data to provide a more complete image of how Mississippi Christians make sense out of their relationship with gays and lesbians, some of whom continue to harbor extremely negative feelings even after repeated social contact.Making meaning: How interviewees describe relationships with gays & lesbiansOf the 40 Mississippi Christians interviewed, 18 respondents report having a gay or lesbian family member. These relationships range from as close as respondent’s own child to as distant as their stepchild’s relative. Four interviewees indicate having a gay or 136                 lesbian child or sibling. Sixteen gay or lesbian cousins, aunts/uncles, and niece/nephews are described. Four interviewees say their wife or husband has a gay or lesbian sibling or cousin. Finally, one respondent tells me about his godmother and another about her stepson’s aunt.Of those interviewed, 31 respondents claim to have at least one gay or lesbian friend. Although interview participants were chosen based on the fact they had either a friend or family member who identified as gay or lesbian, when asked about relationshipswith gays and lesbians six respondents only discussed acquaintances and colleagues, but indicated they have no friends who identify as gay or lesbian. Three evangelical Protestant interviewees also discussed their relationships with “former” gays and lesbians (friends who have “struggled” with homosexuality, but now identify as heterosexual). Most respondents describe distant relationships with their gay or lesbian family members and friends. Even a number of those who say they have a close relationshipwith their gay or lesbian family member or friend report little actual contact. They report communicating with gay and lesbian friends or family members only rarely. Many see their family members once or twice a year at family gatherings and others report only occasional communication via telephone or social media.Some of the respondents also discuss how their family members and friends were or are afraid to come out to them. For example, Brenda, a Catholic, explains her brother-in-law is gay, but has never felt comfortable coming out to the family. She says:He was never comfortable enough to reveal his sexual orientation to our family, to my husband’s family. So I think it’s always been kind of implied, I don’t think I ever was told ‘oh, you know he’s gay’. But, just getting to know him, and know 137                the family, and know that he’s had a roommate the last fifteen years and knowing his roommate and knowing his interactions it’s pretty obvious that he is [gay]although he’s never come out to me.Another Catholic, Hillary, says her brother delayed telling her he was gay because he was afraid of what she would think. She explains, “I have twelve brothers and sisters and Iwas the last one that he called. I guess he was most fearful of telling me. I don’t know why because that’s my little brother, the one that I always looked out after. I guess he didn’t want to disappoint me, you know?”When a gay or lesbian family member does decide to come out to their family, many Mississippi Christians do not accept they are actually gay or lesbian. For example, Erica, an evangelical Protestant, explains her thoughts about her niece who came out. She tells me: I’ve got a great niece who has just said that she thinks she’s gay. I don’t exactly like the comment that ‘I am gay’ because I don’t think she knows what she isright now. I think she’s confused, you know. And I feel like what it is, it’s gay tendencies, those kinds of things. But yeah, she just went to college and she’s you know struggling with that or maybe not struggling. I don’t know.Similarly, Frances, an evangelical Protestant, explains her son is gay and she does notaccept his “lifestyle”. When I asked Frances if she was embarrassed to tell people her son is gay she explains:I wouldn’t say embarrassed. No. There was a different reason I didn’t want to tellthem, it wasn’t because of embarrassment... Because my thought was this issomething he’s gone through school, ninth, tenth grade being called gay because 138                 he didn’t participate in sports, and then so many years of being called that I guessyou get to the point where you believe it like everything else… I say he’sconfused and I didn’t want to um, tell any and everybody and have it be out there and then when he comes to the realization of … the life that he’s supposed to live then he’d have to go back and you know face these people… when they assume he’s one thing and he’s not. You understand what I’m saying? ... It's out ofprotection.These respondents feel their gay or lesbian friends or family members are confused and just need help realizing they are not actually gay.Another interesting point that came up when talking about social contact with gays and lesbians is most interviewees explain their family member or friend never came out to them, they just knew. Again we see interviewees conflating gender and sexuality.If the boy/man does not act masculine enough or the girl/woman does not act feminine enough then many interviewees explain this is a sure sign they are gay or lesbian. For instance, Angela, an evangelical Protestant, tells me she always knew her nephew was gay. She says:He just kind of grew up that way, acting sissy or whatever and so we just all kind of always assumed he was like that [gay]… Not really sissy, he just always was, you know he wanted to bake and he wanted to act, and he wanted to. Anyway, I don’t know, his mannerisms just always seemed very, not manly. Feminine, yeah.Deborah, a mainline Protestant, also explains her aunt did not have to come out to her because she already knew she was a lesbian. She says, “I knew she was gay before she knew she was gay… She didn't tell me, she doesn't have to tell me.” Along the same 139                   lines, Ervin, an evangelical Protestant, tells me he knows his nephew is gay even though he has not admitted it. He explains:I don't think he's admitted it yet. He hasn't come out and publically said it… [but] there's little doubt… I’m just saying that um, all of his friends, like most of hisfriends, are [gay]… and his mannerisms and activities and everything else so, it’s something that I’ve, you know, pretty much seen.Kristina, a Catholic, explains she knew her husband’s cousin was gay the first time shemet him; “My parents having gay friends when I was younger I kind of knew the tale tell signs of it and just even as young as ten and eleven years old he had homosexualtendencies.” When he finally came out to her she told him she knew all along.When interviewees were asked if they are embarrassed by their gay or lesbian family member or friend, a handful indicate they are not embarrassed, but to prove this they use examples of asking others to pray for them or bringing them to church. For instance, Angela explains she is not embarrassed by her gay nephew, “in fact, I brought his name up to my Sunday school class and asked them to pray for him and all.” While respondents do not feel embarrassed by their gay or lesbian friend or relative, it is also worth noting they only present them to other Christians in the context of asking for help to ‘fix’ the friend or family member while implicitly claiming heterosexual privilege for themselves.Finally, many interviewees try to explain why they are not close to or are no longer close to their gay and lesbian family members and friends. Although some of the reasons seem unrelated to sexual orientation, others appear to be a justification for no longer wanting to spend time with friends or family members after discovering their 140                     sexuality. Lack of closeness is explained away by distance, age, change in interest, and children. For example, Caleb, an evangelical Protestant, tells me he used to be very close to his wife’s cousin. He says they are no longer close, but it is not due to his sexuality.Caleb explains, “It doesn’t affect our relationship um, the fact that he’s gay, it’s more that our interests have changed.”How should Christians handle the issue of homosexuality?When asked if knowing someone who is gay or lesbian changed their view of how Christians should deal with the issue of homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights the answers vary widely, but again we see a general pattern begin to emerge. When interviewees were asked about the effects of social contact on beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality responses fell into one of four categories: Yes; Yes, but…; No; and No, because… I explain each of these categories and provide examples of interview responsesfrom each.YesThe first category is made up of those respondents who fit the typical pattern we expect of social contact from the literature. They describe holding conservative and stereotypical beliefs about homosexuality and gay and civil rights prior to social contact.After personally getting to know someone who identifies as gay and/or lesbian, the respondents in this category fully support gay and lesbian civil rights. Additionally, these respondents no longer feel homosexuality is sinful or at least not an issue for them to judge. Overall, 15 percent of interviewees fall into this category. With the exception of one Catholic, all of the respondents in this category are mainline Protestants. Notably, no 141                    evangelical Protestants interviewed fell into this group. Social contact clearly had the greatest positive effects for mainline Protestants, 26.3 percent of whom indicate socialcontact led them to be more open-minded and supportive of gay and lesbian civil rights.Kelsey, a mainline Protestant, provides an excellent example of this category. She explains how her views shifted after getting to know gays and lesbians and how she believes social contact can change Christian’s views more generally. She states:In high school I was hanging out with some more conservative Christians, that’s a nice way to put it… that was like a couple of years… and the more I got to know [gay and lesbian] people and know their stories and figure out what was important and also the more I thought about the political side of it and all that, it changed my mind... It’s not a personal struggle for me. It’s easy for me to get married, which I also feel guilty about… Because I have the privilege, I guess it’s something like white privilege, you know or hetero privilege or whatever… But once getting to know [gay and lesbian] people I think that [change] went across the board... I think it [getting to know gays and lesbians] will wake up Christians across the board you know.Kelsey and others in this category believe in the positive effects of social contact. They indicate getting to know gay and lesbian individuals should have a positive effect on Christians and lead to a reduction in prejudice.Yes, but…The second category of respondents consists of those who indicate social contact with gays and lesbians had a positive effect on them, but they continue to either fully oppose or only conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights. This “Yes, but…” 142              category makes up 20 percent of the overall sample. Thirty percent of evangelical Protestants and 27.3 percent of Catholics fall into this group. Only 10.5 percent of mainline Protestants fit into this “Yes, but...” category. Most respondents in this category indicate social contact with gays and lesbians made them approach this population in amore empathetic manner; however, their conservative religious beliefs continue to outweigh the positive effects of social contact when it comes to changes in beliefs. This group continues to hold that homosexuality is sinful or “not natural” and continues to oppose or only conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights. Despite this, respondents in the “Yes, but…” category do feel social contact has the positive consequence of reducing negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. Respondents in this group indicate they learned how to approach the subject more from a “place of love” after knowing someone who identifies as gay or lesbian.Andrew, an evangelical Christian, explains getting to know gay and lesbian individuals helped him to see “we don't need to speak judgmentally, divisively, in a way that shuts people down. And we need to be very careful to be open-armed with folks.”Although he continues to feel strongly that homosexuality is sinful, social contact made him less judgmental in his approach of the subject. Another evangelical Protestant, Candace, describes a similar effect of social contact. She explains, “Hopefully people react with the fact when talking to someone who’s walking in that lifestyle they’re talking to a human being you know and show respect for that person as a human being. But also reach out to them in a way that you know they can be helpful in some way.” Susan, a Catholic respondent, also fits into this “Yes, but…” category. When asked if getting to know someone changed her opinion of gay and lesbian civil rights, she says, “Probably. I143                         probably didn’t even think they should have civil unions… It's mellowed me a bit.” Here again we see the positive effects expected from social contact, however, the conservative religious beliefs continue to temper acceptance of gay and lesbian civil rights.Hillary provides the most vivid representation of the “Yes, but…” category.While social contact had a positive effect on Hillary’s beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality, she still struggles to overcome the dissonance between her conservative Catholic beliefs and loving her brother who identifies as gay. As previously shown, many Catholics inhabit the middle ground between acceptance and condemnation. The Catholics interviewed for this project displayed higher levels of ambivalence thanevangelical or mainline Protestants. They often struggle to settle the discord between what the catechism says about homosexuality and their relationships with gays and lesbians.Hillary, a white woman in her mid-50s, clearly displays the ambivalence and dissonance some conservative Catholics face. While social contact has had a positive effect on her beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, it has not had a strong enough influence to change her conservative religious beliefs about the topic. Prior to social contact, Hillary was secure in her belief homosexuality is wrong and sinful, and then her brother came out to her. She explains:Before my brother had his out of the closet experience to us, I thoughthomosexuality was wrong. You know all the verses in the Bible points towards [homosexuality] being wrong. But then when my brother announced that he was gay, I guess it really made me think about what I was reading. And if I truly am a Catholic, and I truly believe the catechism, the catechism teaches that 144                   homosexuality is wrong. But the thing that just keeps coming back in my mind is that our God is a God of love, and when in doubt, love.She discusses praying to God and asking why the Bible is not clearer on the issue of homosexuality. She seeks a straightforward answer and in its absence clings to the idea of love. However, even this is not a comfortable solution to Hillary because she believes the true interpretation of the Bible is found in the catechism which condemns homosexuality.She finds it extremely difficult to merge these differing beliefs about her religion and her brother. Her ambivalence is clear when I ask if she agrees with the Catholic Church’steachings on homosexuality. She responds, “Yes. Yes. Do I sound like I do? Based on the answers that I give, or am I on the fence?”Hillary explains how social contact with her brother changed her opinion about homosexuality being a choice, because she knows he did not chose to be gay; “I used to think that it was chosen, a chosen way of life, but I know with my brother, it was not, because even when he was little he had female tendencies… I know he didn't choose that way of life… but that's just the way God made him.” She says this is her “dilemma”, how can she condemn something if it is the way God made him.Hillary’s beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights shows the same level of ambivalence and dissonance. When asked if gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, Hillary answers, “I don’t know. Now I mean there’s a part of me that says no, thatit does not lead to a good family life. But yet, you know how can [gays and lesbians] be denied the wonderful gift of a family?” Ultimately, she believes gays and lesbians getting married will devalue the institution of marriage and instead explains civil unions are abetter option in her opinion; “I like the idea of keeping it a civil union... I think it comes 145                        down to defining what is a marriage and most churches define marriage as between a man and a woman. So let’s not get that confused. Let’s not expand that definition. Instead, let’s make a new word for it.” Similarly, when it comes to same-sex adoption Hillary holds a middle ground. She believes gays and lesbians raising children is not anideal situation, but it is better than children not having parents at all. She says, “if this was a perfect society where everybody had a mom and a dad then we wouldn’t need that.” Additionally, she qualifies her acceptance of gays and lesbians adopting children by saying they must make sure to have opposite sex mentors in the child’s life, otherwise, the child will not know how to properly be a man or a woman.Hillary believes her brother coming out to her had mainly positive effects on their relationship. She feels closer to him now; however, she explains one negative impact isshe feels somewhat embarrassed by his sexual orientation. She explains she does not want to tell her children. Despite her reservations, Hillary does feel knowing her brother is gay has changed the way she sees homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. She explains she is more “lenient” about civil rights than she was before she knew about her brother’s sexuality. Additionally, she tells me as a Christian she focuses more on love now than on the prohibitions against homosexuality.Overall, social contact has had positive effects on Hillary’s beliefs about homosexuality. However, this close contact has not been enough to completely override her religious beliefs that homosexuality is sinful. Hillary continues to live with the dissonance and ambivalence some Mississippi Christians experience when they care deeply about someone who is gay or lesbian, but cannot find a place within their faith that will allow them to be completely accepting of homosexuality.146              NoThe majority of Mississippi Christians interviewed indicate social contact did notinfluence their beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality or gay and lesbian civil rights.Though the reason for denying the positive effects of social contact vary, 65 percent of interviewees say social contact with gays and lesbians had no influence on their beliefs and attitudes toward the topic. A quarter of the respondents interviewed fall into the third category of analysis, “No”. This group continues to argue homosexuality is always sinful and they continue to fully oppose or only conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights. Social contact did not have positive effects on their beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality. Six out of ten (60 percent) of evangelical Protestants fit this description (although one of these respondents states she supports gay and lesbian civil rights, it is only because she does not believe government should interfere with marriage and adoption). Additionally, 18.2 percent of Catholics and 10.5 percent of mainline Protestants suggest social contact did not affect their beliefs and they continue to oppose or only conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights. This category clearly suggests conservative religion is a negative feature that deters the positive benefits of social contact. When one evangelical Protestant, Erica, was asked if knowing someone who is gay or lesbian made her think differently about certain civil rights she says, “I always kind of felt like whether I knew people or not that was wrong and it shouldn’t be happening. So I don’t think it’s changed just because I got to know people that are.” Another evangelical Protestant, Darlene, discusses how having a very close friend in high school did not have the effect of making her more accepting of147                     homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. When I asked her if having a close gay friend changed her beliefs about homosexuality, she says:Not really. It did make it hard because I would never try to come at him that he was wrong. But I still, as a Christian, I think that Jesus offers us a lot of good things and I wouldn’t want him not to know that. But he was always uncomfortable with that because of his lifestyle and he knew that the church doesn’t necessarily uphold that. Most of them [gays and lesbians] as a wholedon’t [want to talk about it] and so he kind of just got quiet and would just change the subject type of thing if that ever came up like religious beliefs and stuff.Darlene’s religious identity and beliefs were more important to her than her identity as a friend to someone who identified as gay. While she tried to be considerate of him, she feltit was important to tell him her beliefs.Along the same lines, Ervin also holds conservative religious beliefs despite the fact he attends a mainline Protestant church. He is one of two mainline Protestants who fall into the “No” category.  Ervin has a nephew who identifies as gay and a niece who identifies as lesbian. Despite close social contact with his family members, he stronglybelieves churches should accept gays and lesbians only in order to help them change.  He explains, “You have to say everything about this particular behavior [homosexuality] is unacceptable… if you say this behavior is acceptable, your religion means pretty much nothing, if you simply accept everything that’s going on out there.”Clearly close family relationships with gays and lesbians may not have the positive effects we would expect if the respondent holds conservative religious beliefs. If the respondent’s religious identity is their primary identity, social contact may have no148                           influence on beliefs about homosexuality. It is evident those in the “No” category do not experience the same type of dissonance we saw in Hillary’s story. These respondents arenot ambivalent or confused in their beliefs; they are sure their religion is correct and gays and lesbians need to hear the “truth” to be set free.Frances in particular exemplifies the ‘No’ position. She is an evangelical Protestant. She is a black woman in her early 50s. About seven years ago her son came out as gay to her when he was 18 years old. Despite this extremely close social contact, she continues to believe homosexuality is always sinful; she says it is “not God’s way.”Frances is fully opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption and argues the gay and lesbian civil rights movement is bad for society. She describes a close relationship withher son before finding out he was gay, yet she does not feel their currently strained relationship is a result of her feelings about homosexuality.Frances’ interview shows how religious identity can outweigh the positive benefits of social contact. Despite knowing her son is gay, Frances continued to hold negative beliefs about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. She argues same-sex marriage would add to the “downward spiral” of marriage. Frances also explains she does not support civil unions between same-sex partners. Additionally, she is completely opposed to same-sex adoption. She believes other people will be cruel to the children of same-sex parents and same-sex adoption would lead to confusion for children.When she talks about her relationship with her son, Frances explains, we are “not as close as we used to be and it has nothing to do with his lifestyle.” However, as she continues it becomes clear her son’s sexuality is a barrier in their relationship. When I ask if her son’s sexuality affects their relationship she says, “As far as he’s concerned it did… 149                   Because I don’t believe what he believes in. He felt distant… He was upset because Ididn’t accept it. So I mean it’s gotten better, our relationship, but it’s not the way it was.”She tells me she was not embarrassed to tell people he was gay, but did not because she thought it was just a phase.It is clear Frances loves her son; however, social contact is not enough to change her religious beliefs about homosexuality or to justify support of gay and lesbian civil rights. Frances hopes her son will recognize homosexuality is sinful and he is merely reacting to the social conditions of bullying he faced in high school. She openly tells meher son’s sexuality has in no way changed her beliefs about gay and lesbian civil rights or how a Christian should deal with this issue. She says, “He knows I feel like… the life he leads is not according to the Bible and he knows that I don’t believe in it.” Clearly, Frances does not believe her religious beliefs should be questioned. It is her son who is confused, not her. Her son is struggling because of his own choice to be gay, not because he is rejected by his mother. Close social contact over an extended period of time failed to have the positive influence research would lead us to believe it would. Frances’evangelical religious beliefs hold strong despite social contact. Frances believes caring about her son means showing through her actions what it means to be a Christian and hoping her son will eventually recognize his sin and repent.No, because…The remaining 40 percent of interview respondents fit into the “No, because…”category. These respondents suggest social contact did not affect their opinions about homosexuality or gay and lesbian civil rights for a number of reasons. The reasons stated include: I always knew someone who identified as gay or lesbian; I never considered the 150                          issue before social contact with someone who is gay or lesbian; I’ve never judged or“hated” people because they were gay or lesbian; and, I’ve always been accepting of gay and lesbian civil rights. Unlike the respondents in the “No” category, these respondents do not deny the effects of social contact due to their religious beliefs and identity. They clarify reasons why social contact did not influence their beliefs beyond the fact that homosexuality is wrong. No one in the “No, because…” category fully opposes gay and lesbian civil rights.A quarter of respondents in this group conditionally support gay and lesbian civil rights while 75 percent fully support gay and lesbian civil rights. Only one evangelical Protestant falls into this category. About half of Catholics (45.5 percent) and mainline Protestants (52.6 percent) fit into this group. Therefore, while most of the respondentsindicate knowing someone gay or lesbian did not change their beliefs and attitudes it is not for a reason we may assume. Rather this portion of the sample has always known someone or has always been supportive, therefore, the influence of contact with this outgroup was not needed to improve attitudes and reduce prejudice for most.While responses in this category vary, Brenda’s reaction to the effects of social contact provides a general understanding of those who fit into this group. Brenda is a Catholic respondent who describes conditional support for gay and lesbian civil rights. She explains social contact with gays and lesbians has not influenced her beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian rights because she has always beenopen-minded and accepting. She says:I grew up in a household that was very… understanding of different cultures and respectful of different opinions as long as it wasn’t infringing on someone’s151                 rights, so I don’t know that [social contact] really shaped [my opinions] necessarily. I think I already had the inherent perspective and appreciation for different values from my home life, maybe not really for gays and lesbians specifically, but just in general.Another Catholic, Tracy, offers a similar response. She explains she never thought aboutgay and lesbian civil rights before social contact with gays and lesbians. Tracy also says social contact did not change how she felt Christians should address the issue of homosexuality because she “never harbored any real prejudices.” Many of the respondents in this category provide similar responses. Social contact did not change their beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality because they have always beenaccepting of gay and lesbian equality, or at least conditional inclusion.Along the same lines, a number of respondents describe close social contact at such a young age that they had not considered the issue before knowing someone who identifies as gay or lesbian. For instance, Deborah, a mainline Protestant, explains, “I was twelve years old… the first time I realized [I knew someone who was gay] and I neverthought of anything [before]. When you’re twelve years old you don’t think about things like that, you think about going and playing.” Overall, the respondents in the “No, but…” category describe always being open-minded about homosexuality or forming theirbeliefs and opinions after acknowledging they had a relationship with someone who identifies as gay or lesbian. Social contact may still have had a positive effect on these respondents; however, it is impossible to test since their beliefs were formed after the initial contact. That is, social contact cannot be viewed as a mechanism of change in 152                    these cases although it may be partially or fully responsible for the more accepting and supportive attitudes held by those in the “No, but…” category.   ConclusionOverall, Mississippi Christians report high levels of social contact with gays and lesbians. However, it is clear social contact is not always enough to overcome prejudice. Despite the many positive benefits of social contact between in and outgroups (Allport 1954), Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) are correct that there are negative features that deter the positive benefits. This supports previous studies which indicate conservative religion is clearly one of those negative features (Bramlett 2012; Baker and Brauner-Otto 2014). Social contact with gays and lesbians did not lead any evangelical Protestants to fully support gay and lesbian civil rights. Additionally, social contact did not have a strong enough effect to change the minds of Catholics who hold more conservative religiousbeliefs. Despite having family members and friends who are gay or lesbian, evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics continue to feel homosexuality is sinful and gays and lesbians should attempt to overcome this sin. This supports Smith et al.’s (1998) theory of subcultural identity. While being the friend or family member of someone who identifies as gay or lesbian is usually enough to change beliefs and opinions abouthomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights for mainline Protestants and more liberal Catholics, conservative Christians’ religious identity appears to be more important than these relationships. The need to set themselves apart from society at large for evangelical Protestants (Smith et al. 1998) or as good Catholics for conservative Catholics(Konieczny 2013) seems to outweigh the positive benefits of social contact with gays and lesbians.153                 Conservative Christians either weigh their religious identity above their relationships with gay and lesbian friends and family members or accept the cognitive dissonance that comes with believing in a religion that condemns homosexuality while maintaining close social contact with gays and lesbians. Many respondents admit they had not even considered there was a discord between their beliefs and behaviors before speaking to me. Some choose to keep the two things separate; they have gay and lesbian friends and they go to a church that condemns their sexuality. They do not perceive these positions as contradictory. Others believe the only way to show compassion to their gay and lesbian friends and family members is by trying to help them see the error of theirways. They feel loving someone who is gay or lesbian means changing them, not theirown religion. Finally, some conservative Christians, particularly conservative Catholics, do notice the dissonance between their beliefs and behaviors. They struggle to merge their beliefs and relationships (Festinger 1957; Mahaffy 1996). Hillary’s example shows one primary way conservative Catholics overcome dissonance, they focus on “love.”In conclusion, the positive effects we expect from social contact with gays and lesbians based on previous research (Herek and Capitanio 1996; Bowen and Bourgeois2001; Hinrichs and Rosenberg 2002; Finlay and Walther 2003; Hodson et al. 2009; Barth and Parry 2009; Baunach et al. 2010; Lewis 2011) are only evident with mainline Protestants and some Catholics. These respondents focus on biblical passages about love and being non-judgmental. They ignore or reinterpret passages others use to show homosexuality is sinful. They feel their loved ones are more important than a few biblical passages that condemn homosexuality. Getting to know someone who identifies as gay or lesbian has the ability to overcome prejudice and lead to support of gay and lesbian civil 154                      rights for those who do not hold conservative religious beliefs. For those who place theirconservative religious identity at the forefront, social contact is not sufficient for overcoming prejudice. Their subcultural identity (Smith et al. 1998) as Christians is moreimportant than their relationships with gays and lesbians. Although it is unclear from this data if there are other ways to overcome this prejudice and opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights, opportunities seem slim. If having a gay or lesbian child or sibling cannot override conservative Christian beliefs about homosexuality I’m not sure what can.Hopefully, circumstances are not as bleak as one mainline Protestant put it, “I believe thatfor your generation and my son’s generation, [homosexuality] is not even an issue. And I think it will ultimately change but I think there will need to be a few more funerals.”When I asked what he means he continues, “People of my generation and older need to die.”155                             CHAPTER VIICONCLUSIONThe goal of this study was to provide a more complete understanding of Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Through surveys and interviews with Mississippi Christians, I examined how Christians make sense of their relationships with gays and lesbians in light of their religious beliefs.Conservative Christians are often vocal opponents of gay and lesbian civil rights in the United States. However, activists and proponents of gay and lesbian civil rights rarely take the time to truly listen to these beliefs and fully understand them. I provided a morenuanced perspective of how these beliefs are formed and what they mean for gay and lesbian civil rights. I then examined how social contact with gays and lesbians influenced Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Understanding how religion and social contact work together or contradict one another when it comes to prejudice against gays and lesbians provides valuable information for those seeking equality. I examined these two mechanisms in the South, specifically Mississippi, because there are a larger number of conservative Christians and it is a location where gay and lesbian civil rights are the most opposed. By talking to Mississippi Christians about their religious identity, beliefs and attitudes towardhomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, and social contact with gay and lesbian friends and family members, I am able to provide a more nuanced understanding of the 156                interactions between religion and prejudice towards gays and lesbians and how this is influenced by social contact.  Increased social contact, measured in this study by communication with gay and lesbian friends and family members, should lead to more positive beliefs and attitudestoward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. However, this study shows the positive effects of social contact are not necessarily sufficient for overcomingconservative religious beliefs which condemn homosexuality. I expanded previousresearch on this topic through a more complete measure of social contact and by allowing respondents sufficient opportunity to explain the reasons having a friend or family member who is gay or lesbian affects or does not affect their opinions about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Overall, I argue scholars and activistsneed to reconsider what leads Christians to opposition of gay and lesbian civil rights and how to properly address this issue. I examined why social contact with gays and lesbiansis not an always sufficient means of overcoming prejudice towards gays and lesbians. I show the ambivalence and contradictions apparent in Mississippi Christians’ responses call for a more in-depth analysis than has been previously completed. Chapters IV and V address the research questions regarding what Mississippi Christians believe about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights and how these beliefs and attitudes vary based on religious affiliation. These chapters provide a general picture of the state of opinion about homosexuality among respondents. They show beliefs about homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights among Mississippi Christians are far more complex and diverse than previously indicated.  157                     When it comes to beliefs about homosexuality generally, Mississippi Christians’views vary widely from complete rejection to complete acceptance. Of the three categories of analysis, evangelical Protestants hold the most conservative views aboutreligion and homosexuality. Supporting Smith et al.’s (1998) theory of subculturalidentity, evangelical Protestants use the issue of homosexuality to set themselves apart from the rest of society. Evangelical Protestants’ beliefs about homosexuality create an embattled identity for this group and lead them to fight against a society that is, in their opinion, moving away from God. This struggle with the larger society provides an important identity marker for evangelical Protestants and allows them to thrive based on their distinction. Like on most issues considered in this study, Mississippi Catholics fall somewhere in between evangelical and mainline Protestants on the continuum of acceptance to opposition. Catholics show more ambivalence surrounding issues of homosexuality; they do not fully accommodate with the larger society, however, the do not appear to be as embattled with it as evangelical Protestants. In this study, when it comes to the topic of homosexuality Catholics seem to lean more towards acceptancethan towards to the more conservative beliefs of evangelical Protestants. However, Catholics’ acceptance is not complete; they describe a conditional inclusion of gays and lesbians into the Catholic Church.Mainline Protestants’ beliefs about homosexuality align more closely with secular society. Most mainline Protestants argue homosexuality is not sinful and the Bible sayslittle or nothing about the issue. Mainline Protestants argue gays and lesbians should be accepted fully into their churches and it is not the place of Christians to judge sexuality. 158                       Despite the divergent beliefs about homosexuality across religious identity, we see changes occurring in all categories. This increased ambivalence and uncertainty is even more pronounced when it comes to the issue of gay and lesbian civil rights. While Mississippi Christians’ opinions of gay and lesbian civil rights are shifting,the continuum of acceptance to opposition still emerges along religious identity in the same way as with beliefs about homosexuality. On one end, we see mainline Protestantsare generally supportive of gay and lesbian civil rights. They show the highest levels of support for same-sex marriage and adoption. Additionally, mainline Protestants generally see at least some positive benefits of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement moregenerally.Catholics are divided on how to best approach gay and lesbian civil rights. MostCatholics interviewed continued to uphold the conservative teachings of the Catholic Church, however, they simultaneously sought to grant gays and lesbians conditional acceptance. Catholics again take a middle ground, while they grant some civil rights they do so conditionally. Catholics interviewed frequently supported civil unions betweensame-sex partners but not marriage; supported same-sex adoption but only out ofnecessity and when certain conditions were met; and divided over the influence of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement more generally.  Finally, evangelical Protestants largely described complete opposition to same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. Again they use the issues surrounding gay and lesbian civil rights as a boundary to protect theirembattled Christian identity. They explain how allowing gays and lesbians more rights is an indication that Christians and society more broadly are moving away from God’s plan. 159                        Although their opposition does not appear to stem from a place of hate, there is surelyevidence that evangelical Protestants are fearful of what gay and lesbian civil rights mean for the future.After understanding what Mississippi Christians believe about homosexuality and gay and lesbian rights, I sought to determine if social contact had any effect on these beliefs. Chapter VI answers the research questions: What influence does social contact with gays and lesbians have on these beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights? How do Christians reconcile their religious beliefs with theirpersonal relationships with gay and lesbian individuals and how does this reconciliation work similarly or differently based on religious category?While Mississippi Christians report high levels of social contact with gays and lesbians, it is clear conservative religion counterbalances the positive effects of this social contact. Therefore, conservative religion is a negative feature that deters the influence ofsocial contact to overcome prejudice. Despite having family members and friends who are gay or lesbian, evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics did not change their opinions about the sinful nature of homosexuality or become more supportive of gay and lesbian civil rights. While mainline Protestants’ and more liberal Catholics’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights began to shift after social contact, conservative Christians hold strong to their opposition.Overall, conservative Christians’ subcultural identity appears to be moreimportant than their relationships with gays and lesbians. Some Catholic respondents do experience cognitive dissonance when trying to live with this contradiction of having gay and/or lesbian friends and family members while adhering to a religion that condemns 160                     their sexuality. On the other hand, most evangelical Protestants do not experience this dissonance. They are confident in their religious beliefs and question their friend orfamily members’ sexuality, not their own beliefs about homosexuality.In sum, the positive influence of social contact with gays and lesbians is only evident with mainline Protestants and some Catholics. However, for conservative Christians whose religious identity is paramount, social contact is not a sufficient means for overcoming prejudice and leading to support of gay and lesbian civil rights. Their subcultural identity overshadows their relationships with gays and lesbians.  LimitationsAs with any project, there are some limitations to this study that should be pointed out. First, I would like to note the difference between phone and face-to-face interviews.As previously discussed, 19 of the interviews completed for this study were face-to-face interviews while 21 were conducted via telephone.  Two limitations arise from this variation; the first limitation being the influence of the researcher. While I attempted to present myself as neutral as possible in both dress and expression, there is always an influence between individuals when talking face-to-face. However, from my participants’responses it seemed that each assumed I was similar to themselves in sexuality, religious beliefs, and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights.  Either way, this face-to-face interaction surely effected respondents’ answers in some ways that were not present in phone interviews.  The second limitation that arises due to these two different types of interviews is my interpretation of what the respondent was saying or meant. With the 19 face-to-face interviews I was able to read facial expressions and other non-verbal cues that I missed in phone interviews. This was not a complete difference as 161                       I was able to hear changes in voice tone, pauses, and able to read discomfort in answering some questions even via telephone. Despite these differences and limitations, respondents’ answers were similar and consistent with the categories I presented in thisstudy whether they were interviewed face-to-face or via telephone.  In line with this limitation, it is important to point out another way future qualitative research on this topic can be improved. As noted in my data and methodschapter, one of the most challenging tasks for this project was gathering a sample of Mississippi churches and individuals willing to discuss religion and homosexuality. I recommend future researchers take time to develop relationships with more pastors and congregations in order to gather larger samples. The conservative nature of the South combined with the current framing of evangelical Protestants as homophobic and closed minded made it very difficult to get conservative Christians to speak to an academicabout sexuality, specifically homosexuality. I feel the only way to overcome this limitation is through building more rapport with conservative Christians and representing them in respectful ways.  Trust is paramount for studying this topic, especially sinceevangelical Protestants have a high level of fear surrounding homosexuality and how they are being framed in the media. Therefore, scholars and activists alike must continue to listen and take a more respectful tone if we want to gain access to this population andtruly understand their beliefs and attitudes. DiscussionThis study is important for a number of reasons. First, research has conclusively shown religion, specifically conservative Christianity, increases prejudice towards gays and lesbians (Duck & Hunsberger 1999; Emerson & Smith 2000; Rowatt et al. 2006; Hill162                   et al. 2010; Bramlett 2012). However, most research has not expanded upon this point to understand the nuanced reasons Christians hold more prejudicial beliefs and attitudestoward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. Biblical literalism is often seen as the root of the problem, specifically when it comes to the issue of homosexuality, and further investigation is ceased. This study clearly shows it is impossible to gain a true understanding of Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality using this simple argument. While biblical literalism may be a part of the puzzle, I show most Christians in Mississippi do not even know what the Bible says about homosexuality. The minority who do knowwhat the Bible says, or what they interpret the Bible to say about homosexuality, still hold very diverse perspectives about the topic. In addition, I argue those promoting or accepting equality for gays and lesbians have painted a rather limited image of conservative Christians. My conversations with evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics indicate it is their sincere convictions which leads them to opposehomosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, not homophobia. Generally, conservative Christians hold much more ambiguous beliefs about homosexuality than most previous research has indicated. Conservative Christians value their personal relationships withgay and lesbian friends and family members, but sometimes struggle to reconcile this with their religious beliefs.Overall, the findings in this study suggest fighting opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights by encouraging gays and lesbians to come out of the closet (reveal theirsexuality) to conservative Christians or by attacking homophobia and hatred will not provide the results expected. At this important stage in the gay and lesbian civil rights 163                      movement when the Supreme Court is months away from a crucial decision that will render gays and lesbians equal citizens through their right to marry in the United States, we must find a new way to approach the vocal minority of Christians who continue tohold strong opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights. To move forward at this moment in history means to stop painting caricatures of conservative Christians and begin to listen.It means acknowledging that coming out to conservative Christians may not provide the results scholars and activists have predicted.. It is time for a new way of approaching the countermovement of conservative Christians who oppose gay and lesbian civil rights.Minimizing conservative Christian beliefs to homophobia and hate is only exacerbatingthe problem. Conservative Christians do not identify with these labels; they truly believe the only way to love someone who is gay or lesbian is to help them overcome this sin. By offering a more complete understanding of conservative Christians’ beliefs and attitudestoward homosexuality, this study takes a step towards uncovering new approaches toreaching this population and showing the harm they are doing to their gay and lesbian friends and family members. These new strategies for reaching conservative Christiansmust allow them to hold onto their strong religious identity without limiting the resources and access to equality of their gay and lesbian friends and family members.Based on these findings, this study poses a number of new questions. What, if anything, has the ability to overcome conservative Christians’ negative beliefs abouthomosexuality and lead them toward greater acceptance of gays and lesbians? Is thereanything that can lead conservative Christians to support gay and lesbian civil rights and not merely grant gays and lesbians conditional inclusion because marriage is already ruined or same-sex parents are better than nothing? If close relationships with gays and 164              lesbians is not enough to overcome these stereotypical beliefs, what steps can be taken to ensure equality? Obviously blanket statements about coming out to improve the position of gays and lesbians in society are not working. So where do we go from here?The magnitude of this dilemma is well beyond the scope of one study or a list of recommendations, however, based on this study there are a few steps I would recommend. First, scholars and activists must stop placing all Christians into one category. There are a large number of Christians who strongly support gay and lesbian civil rights, even in a state such as Mississippi which is portrayed as being wholly conservative. Mainline Protestants and liberal Catholics in Mississippi appreciate their Christian faith while simultaneously supporting their gay and lesbian friends and family members. They argue the Bible says little to nothing about homosexuality and it is theirduty to love and leave to judgement to God. Additionally, some conservative Catholics are working hard to align their religious beliefs with their relationships with gays and lesbians. While they may be struggling with this middle ground, their compassion and conditional inclusion may be a guide to reaching others who hold more conservative Christian beliefs. Interviews showed many evangelical Protestants had not considered the dissonance between their religious beliefs and loving someone who was gay and/or lesbian. Some acknowledged during the interviews this is the first time they had thought about many of the topics. To me this suggests more open and honest conversations are a good place to start. Writing off evangelical Protestants as homophobic and hateful halts further conversation. Nevertheless, as a sociologist who understands the importance of structure in oursociety, I also believe the changing laws and policies surrounding gay and lesbian civil165                     rights may be the only logical move forward. While individual level change is great, I argue those who support gay and lesbian equality must continue to fight for equal rights. Ibelieve beliefs and attitudes of conservative Christians may have to change overtime due to larger structural changes. Historically, conservative Christians held strong oppositionagainst interracial marriages; however, since anti-miscegenation laws were ruledunconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1967 we have slowly seen those beliefs disappear.  I am hopeful my respondents who argue we just have to wait for the oldergenerations to pass away are being too pessimistic. I argue as laws change and scholars and activists begin to approach those opposed to gay and lesbian equality as peoplewhose religious identity holds precedence, rather than as homophobic individuals, we can begin to see change in beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. The pessimistic side of this argument, however, is as conservative Christians become more accepting of homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights, they will have to take up a new issue to maintain their subcultural identity. For conservative Christianity to continue to thrive, they must protect their embattled status and separate themselves from the larger society with some marker (Smith et al. 1998). If sexuality is no longer this boundary, what will it be next?Future researchThere are many directions for future research on this topic. To begin with, it is of utmost importance that longitudinal data begin to be collected on this topic. While cross-sectional data provides a starting point for analysis, it is important we measureindividuals’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights 166                 prior to contact and then following contact to determine the true influence of socialcontact between Christians and gays and lesbians. A second direction that would be beneficial to this topic is to study the effects of social contact with gays and lesbians on Christians more generally. While Mississippi is a great starting point for research on the effects of conservative Christianity, it will be interesting to see how Christians in other areas of the country compare to Mississippi Christians. In addition, future research should seek to determine what other negative features deter the positive influence of socialcontact. This study shows conservative Christianity is one negative feature when it comes to improved relationships between Christians and gays and lesbians. So, for example, areconservative politics also a negative feature that deters the positive effects of socialcontact with gays and lesbians? Finally, I believe this research also leads to a further question of how gay and lesbian Christians deal with the cognitive dissonance between what they have been taught in church and their own sexuality. Although some researchhas initially begun to explore this topic, further research is necessary. There is a need to talk with gays and lesbians and understand how they negotiate their religious identity and their sexual identity. Do some gays and lesbians continue to hold conservative Christian beliefs? Does this lead to internalized homophobia? What is the identity work process for these individuals? 167                            REFERENCESAcker, Joan. 1990. “Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations.”Gender & Society 4(2):139-159.

    "abstract": "Using surveys and interviews with Mississippi Christians, this study provides a more complete understanding of Christians’ beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights. I analyze how Mississippi Christians make sense of their relationships with gay and lesbian friends and family members and how this differs based on their religious identity. I then consider how these beliefs and attitudes are influenced by social contact with gays and lesbians. I find Mississippi Christians’ views toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights vary widely from rejection to acceptance. The most conservative views are held by evangelical Protestants who set themselves apart from society through their beliefs about homosexuality. They feel that homosexuality is always sinful and describe almost complete opposition to gay and lesbian civil rights. On the contrary, mainline Protestants continue to move towards full assimilation with secular society. Many believe the Bible does not say anything about homosexuality and that the church should be accepting of gays and lesbians. Mainline Protestants also largely support gay and lesbian civil rights. Catholics fall in the middle of the continuum. They describe a greater degree of ambivalence about the sinfulness of homosexuality and describe conditional acceptance of gay and lesbian civil rights. Social contact with gays and lesbians did not influence evangelical Protestants beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality or gay and lesbian civil rights. Similarly, conservative Catholics continued to hold on to their more conservative religious beliefs about homosexuality despite social contact. Conservative Christians’ subcultural identity which stands in opposition to homosexuality is stronger than the effects of social contact for evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. On the other hand, social contact is often a strong enough influence to change beliefs and attitudes toward homosexuality and gay and lesbian civil rights for mainline Protestants and more liberal Catholics. This study demonstrates that conservative religion acts as a negative feature that deters the positive benefits of social contact to overcome prejudice",
