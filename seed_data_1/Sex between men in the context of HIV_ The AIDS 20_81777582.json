Evidence from a wide\nrange of studies show that these men remain at the highest risk for HIV acquisition in both\ndeveloped and developing countries, and that despite three decades of evidence of their\nvulnerability to HIV, they remain under-served and under-studied. Prevention strategies targeted\nto MSM are markedly under-funded in most countries, leading to limited access to health services\nincluding prevention, treatment, and care. We explore the global epidemic among MSM in 2008,\nthe limited funding available globally to respond to these epidemics, and the human rights contexts\nand factors which drive HIV spread and limit HIV responses for these men.\nWhat do we mean by the term MSM? MSM is a construct from the 1990s that tries to capture\nbehavior and not identity. It was crafted to avoid stigmatizing and culturally laden terms such as gay\nor bisexual, which do not capture the wide diversity of orientations, sexual practices, cultures, and\ncontextual settings in which male same-sex behaviors occur, and where HIV transmission and\nacquisition risks are centered. MSM includes both gay and non-gay identified men, bisexual men,\nand MSM who identify themselves as heterosexuals. It also includes men engaging in \"situational\"\nsex between men, such as can occur in prisons, schools, militaries or other environments; and it\nincludes male sex workers who may be of any orientation but are often at very high risk for HIV.\nMSM may include some biologically male transgender persons, though some do not identify as male.\nAnd MSM includes a wide array of traditional and local terms worldwide–with enormous cultural\ndiversity in Asia, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. We use the term MSM here at its most\ninclusive.\nReview\nEpidemiology of HIV among MSM\nWhile cultural and human rights contexts, as well as prej-\nudice, misconceptions and ignorance, are clearly impor-\ntant for understanding HIV/AIDS among MSM, risks for\nacquisition and transmission are grounded in individual\nbehavior. At the individual level there are a number of\nknown risk factors for HIV infection among MSM. These\ninclude unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), with the\ngreatest risk being for receptive UAI; a high frequency of\nPublished: 24 December 2008\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 doi:10.1186/1758-2652-11-9\nReceived: 17 October 2008\nAccepted: 24 December 2008\nThis article is available from: http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9\n© 2008 Saavedra et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9male partners (>3 per week); high numbers of lifetime\nmale partners (>10); and a history of injection drug use\n(IDU)–these are individuals with dual MSM and IDU risk,\nand we see these where IDU and MSM epidemics overlap.\nThere also is emerging evidence of the role of non injec-\ntion drugs, especially methamphetamines, which likely\nincrease sexual risks for MSM. In the United States, Black/\nAfrican American race is associated with much higher\nodds of being HIV infected even when controlling for such\nfactors as socio-economic status and educational level [5].\nCountry-level population estimates for HIV among MSM\nreveal a number of trends. Figure 1 shows 2002–2006\nUNAIDS data on HIV rates among MSM from Western\nEurope and Canada–the trends are generally either stable\nor increasing [4]. But if we compare MSM HIV infection\nrates and the rates of HIV among the general population\nof reproductive age adults in selected countries in Western\nEurope, we see that MSM are at much greater risk for HIV\ninfection (Figure 2) [4-6]. These much higher levels of\nHIV prevalence among MSM are seen in Southeast Asia\n(Figure 3) [7-9], as well as in Latin America, where we see\nmuch higher rates of HIV among MSM in contrast to\nreproductive age adults in Mexico, Peru, and Argentina\n(Figure 4) [10-12]. This epidemiologic scenario holds true\neven in generalized epidemics in the world's most HIV\naffected region, Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 5) [13-15].\nAfrican MSM populations are among the most hidden\nand stigmatized worldwide, and the data are sparse, but\nnevertheless, this same epidemiologic pattern holds.\nTo further explore this global trend, Baral, et al, conducted\na systematic review of the global literature from 2000–\n2006 and calculated adjusted odds ratios for MSM com-\npared to reproductive age adults by region and by preva-\nlence (Figure 6)[16]. In Latin America, MSM were 33\ntimes more likely to have HIV infection; in Asia, more\nthan 18 times; and in Africa, 3.8 times as likely. These\nodds ratios were statistically robust despite the fact that\ndata were available from only 38 low- and middle-income\ncountries, and from only 4 African studies. Whenever HIV\nprevalence studies have been done among MSM the same\nconsistent results appear. Yet, global responses have not\nbeen commensurate to these realities. MSM remain\nunder-studied, under-served, under-funded and fre-\nquently ignored or denied by governments. We must ask\nwhy.\nMSM, HIV, and human rights\nA number of factors that influence risk and vulnerability\nfor MSM are contextual–they impact individual men in\ncomplex ways, but they are fundamentally social and\nstructural realities. These include human rights violations,\nthe criminalization of sexual orientation and same-sex\nbehavior, and social stigma. UNAIDS has recognized that\nrealizing human rights is an essential component of suc-\ncess in responding to HIV/AIDS: \"Long-term success in\nresponding to the epidemic will require sustained\nprogress in reducing human rights violations associated\nwith it, including gender inequality, stigma and discrimi-\nHIV infections newly diagnosed in men who have sex with men, by cou try, and year f report, 2002–2006Figure 1\nHIV infections newly diagnosed in men who have sex \nwith men, by country, and year of report, 2002–2006. \nUNAIDS 2008 Global Report.\nHIV Prevalence rates in 4 EU Countries: MSM and General Adult prevalence ratesFigure 2\nHIV Prevalence rates in 4 EU Countries: MSM and \nGeneral Adult prevalence rates.\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations in selected Southe st Asian countriesFigur  3\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations \nin selected Southeast Asian countries.Page 2 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9nation.\" While this statement does not explicitly address\nMSM, it certainly includes them.\nHow do rights limitations affect MSM vulnerability to HIV\ninfection \"on the ground?\"\nMost obviously, where same-sex behavior is criminalized,\nMSM remain hidden, they will be very cautious or refuse\nto get an HIV test, even if they feel they need it, and those\nseeking to reach them with services, from condoms and\nlubricants to education and treatment outreach, can be\nharassed for supporting illegal activities. A recent example\nis from Nepal, where police have beaten peer outreach\nworkers for attempting to distribute condoms. In the\nIndian situation as well, police have used the fact that\nsame-sex behavior is illegal to harass outreach workers\nand interrupt prevention activities. This is the case despite\nthe fact that India's National AIDS Control Organization\n(NACO), which receives substantial government funding,\nhas been strongly supportive of MSM prevention activities\nIn fact, NACO has filed a court challenge to India's sod-\nomy laws on the basis that they are a barrier to HIV pre-\nvention. (Personal communication from Sujata Rao (08/\n05/08). Head of NACO (National AIDS Control Program\nof India).\nAnother recent example of state-sanctioned homophobia\nimpacting HIV programs for MSM comes from Uganda. At\nthe recent PEPFAR Implementers meeting in Kampala,\nUganda, three LGBT activists were arrested and charged\nwhile peacefully demonstrating for access to HIV services\nfor MSM. On 25 July, 2008, the Ugandan police arrested\nand tortured one of the three (the only man) for his con-\ntinued call for access to health services [17].\nThese are not isolated incidents, unfortunately, but exam-\nples of the continued limitation on the rights to freedom\nof expression, privacy, and the rights of consenting adults\nto choose their sex and life partners. The international les-\nbian and gay association, ILGA, maintains a website with\nthe status of rights and protections worldwide [18].\nEighty-six countries in the world criminalize sex between\nconsenting adult men, and more than half of all African\ncountries do so. Nine States have death penalties for\nhomosexual relations between consenting adults includ-\ning: Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,\nSomalia, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen (laws\nin existence in 2004).\nFor example, in Senegal the law states that: \"Without prej-\nudice to the more serious penalties provided for in the\npreceding paragraphs or by articles 320 and 321 of this\nCode, whoever will have committed an improper or\nunnatural act with a person of the same sex will be pun-\nished by imprisonment of between one and five years and\nby a fine of 100,000 to 1,500,000 francs. If the act was\ncommitted with a person below the age of 21, the maxi-\nmum penalty will always be applied.\"\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations in selected Latin-American countriesFigur  4\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations \nin selected Latin-American countries.\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations in selected African cou triesFigur  5\nHIV Prevalence among MSM and general populations \nin selected African countries.\nSystematic Review of HIV among MSM compared to repro-ductive age adults prevalence: adjusted odds ratios by regi n and preval nce levelFigur 6\nSystematic Review of HIV among MSM compared to \nreproductive age adults prevalence: adjusted odds \nratios by region and prevalence level.Page 3 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9From Senegal, is the following personal communication\nto one of the authors (JS): \" I am HIV positive man. Here,\nin my country, to be gay is against the law. The ones who\nare, like myself, we cannot say it openly. In order to social-\nize or meet other gay people, or to dance and be with our\nboyfriends, we need to go to clandestine places, these\nplaces are frequently closed by the police or city authori-\nties, therefore every three months we need to look for the\nnew one. When we go out of the clandestine gay bar, most\nof us will separate and take different roads to our own\nhomes, in order to return to \"normal\" life, with our wives\nand kids. The only possible way to have a socially accept-\nable life, here in Senegal is to marry and have children\"\nPersonal communication with Jorge Saavedra by JOPH,\nperson living with HIV in Dakar (December, 10, 2003).\nHow do these laws compare to international human\nrights standards? The International Convention on the\nEradication of All Forms of Discrimination Against\nWomen (CEDAW) states that: \"Nobody should be forced\nto marry against their will and people should have the\nright to choose who they marry.\" Surely this basic right to\nchoose one's spouse, which was gained by the women's\nmovement, should apply equally to men, including when\ntheir choice is a same sex spouse.\nThe XVII International AIDS Conference began with the\nworld's first international march against homophobia. In\nadvance of the march one of the authors (JS) alerted LGBT\nactivists and the government of Panama that the march\nwould highlight Panama as the only Latin American\ncountry still criminalizing homosexuality. That law was\nchanged by executive order two days before the march,\nmaking Latin America the first region of the once called\nthe third world, to be completely free of these discrimina-\ntory laws. (Belize and Guyana, although they are part of\nthe American continent, are not Latin countries, and are\ngenerally grouped as part of the Caribbean.)\nAs part of honoring Dr. Jonathan Mann, who pioneered\nwork on the interface of HIV and human rights, the HIV/\nAIDS community needs to address the human rights pro-\ntections for MSM and other sexual minorities. The Inter-\nnational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)\nguarantees human rights \"without distinction of any kind,\nsuch as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or\nother opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or\nother status\" [19]. In 1994 the Human Rights Committee\nheld that, under the ICCPR, sexual orientation was a sta-\ntus protected from discrimination, with reference to \"sex\"\nincluding \"sexual orientation.\" This ruling has made clear\nthat discrimination based on sexual orientation is a fun-\ndamental human rights violation. Realizing this right, and\nending discrimination, will likely be essential to achieving\nuniversal access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care for\nMSM. This is a key part of the response, particularly in\nthose settings where social stigma and isolation for MSM\nremain the most marked.\nThe response: Marginalization of MSM in the global \nresponse to HIV/AIDS\nThere is evidence of the marginalization of MSM in the\nglobal response from the United Nations Joint Program\non AIDS (UNAIDS) annual survey conducted among the\nUNAIDS country coordinators in low- and middle-\nincome countries [20]. Indeed, when probed about the\nlevel of participation of the organizations representing\nMSM in national AIDS planning and reviews, most coun-\ntries did not even report on MSM participation (Figure 7)\n[20]. Full participation was reported in 24% of these\ncountries; in 15% there was \"insufficient, yet increasing\nparticipation\". However, this global average blurs impor-\ntant geographical differences. For example, the lowest\nlevel of participation reported was in West and Central\nAfrica, where 0% reported full participation of MSM\norganizations, only 8% of countries reported having\n\"insufficient, yet increasing participation\", and 15%\nreported \"insufficient participation with no sign of\nimprovement\". The region reporting the highest level of\nparticipation was Latin America, with 50% of countries\nreporting full participation and 19% reporting \"insuffi-\ncient, yet increasing participation.\"\nThe reports cited above would seem to warrant some opti-\nmism given that a reported 72% of national AIDS action\nframeworks included prevention programs for MSM.\nHowever, this finding seems to be at odds with other\nresults from the same survey. For example, only 31% of\nnational reports on the epidemic produced globally in\n2007 included government publication of \"a surveillance\nreport that includes MSM\". There was only one country in\nsub-Saharan Africa that included such a report, and one\ncountry in the Middle East and North Africa region that\nNational Planning – Level of participation of the organistions representing MSM in national AIDS reviews in 38 low and middle i come cou triesFigure 7\nNational Planning – Level of participation of the \norganistions representing MSM in national AIDS \nreviews in 38 low and middle income countries.Page 4 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9did so. While half of the countries in the Asia Pacific\nregion reported that they had a government surveillance\nreport disaggregating HIV or AIDS data for MSM in 2007,\nonly 38% of Latin American countries and 25% of Carib-\nbean countries had such a report.\nThis lack of participation has been matched by very lim-\nited funding for MSM-specific programs. United Nations\n(UN) Member States are required to submit country\nprogress reports to the UNAIDS Secretariat every two years\nto monitor progress towards the goals established in the\nUN General Assembly's (UNGASS) 2001 Declaration of\nCommitment on HIV/AIDS (DoC). In adopting the 2001\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, UN Member\nStates obligated themselves to regularly report on their\nprogress to the General Assembly. The Secretary-General\ncharged the UNAIDS Secretariat with the responsibility\nfor developing the reporting process, accepting reports\nfrom member States on his behalf, and preparing a regular\nreport for the General Assembly. These progress reports\ninclude data on HIV spending (by activity and source) as\nthe first indicator of national commitment. This indicator\nmeasures total HIV expenditures, as well as separate\nexpenditures for HIV prevention (and other seven other\ngroups of services and programs). The specific expendi-\nture targeting MSM is to be disaggregated from of the sub-\ntotal for prevention [21].\nUnfortunately, not all countries have been able to report\nwith precision their disaggregated expenditures. A total of\n109 country reports included HIV expenditure informa-\ntion for 2006 [4]. However, of this total, there were only\n55 low- and middle-income countries where the preven-\ntive expenditure could be disaggregated by population.\nThe disaggregated data indicate that a mere 0.6% of pre-\nvention expenditures were actually spent on targeted pre-\nvention for MSM.\nHow do the expenditures relate to the needs? A prelimi-\nnary analysis of country reports on MSM expenditures, as\nreported for the monitoring of the Declaration of Com-\nmitment (DoC) signed during the Special Session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly in 2001 (UNGASS\n2001), could be compared with the 2006 country resource\nneed estimates that UNAIDS previously developed for its\nreport on Global Resource Needs 2006–2008 [22] using\nthe National AIDS Spending Assessments (NASA) classifi-\ncation [23]. Such an analysis demonstrates the existence\nof a substantial financing gap (defined as the difference\nbetween the resource needs and the actual spending) in\nthirty-eight (38) countries with data on MSM financing,\nindicating that while there was an estimated financial\nneed of US $29 million in 2006 (assuming 80% coverage\nof an essential prevention package among the population\nof MSM in each country), the expenditure in these coun-\ntries was estimated at just US $3 million. (The selection of\nthe 38 countries for the comparison between resource\nneeds and expenditures in 2006 was based on the availa-\nbility of data at the time of the XVII International AIDS\nConference in Mexico in August 2008. The expenditure\nreports are owned by reporting countries. The resource\nneeds estimates have not been validated by country offi-\ncials.)\nFigure 8 shows data on the reported prevention expendi-\ntures aimed at MSM in this subset of 38 countries–and\nthis is unacceptably low [23]. Even if slightly different\nfrom the larger set of countries presented above, in this\nsubset of countries, just 1.2% of prevention expenditures\nwere aimed at MSM, with 1% aimed at commercial sex\nworkers, and 2% at harm reduction programs and inject-\ning drug users. The remaining 96% of prevention expen-\nditures were dedicated to non-targeted prevention efforts.\nPreventive expenditures on MSM in countries with gener-\nalized epidemics accounts for 0.1% of total prevention\nefforts (or US $0.001 per inhabitant), while in countries\nwith low level epidemics it represents 2.9% of prevention\nspending (or US $0.004 per inhabitant), and in concen-\ntrated epidemics, 3% (or US $0.01 per inhabitant).\nWhat are MSM receiving as preventive services?\nBased on country reports to monitor progress in the\nimplementation of the DoC, the percentage of MSM in 27\ncountries who report knowing where they could receive\nan HIV test, and who received condoms between 2005\nand 2007 was 40%. Although this was an improvement,\nsince only 9% of MSM responded similarly just two years\nearlier. Nevertheless, this very basic and limited measure\nof access to services still is extremely low.\nWhat is the effect of stigma and discrimination on \npreventing, or in failing to prevent, HIV transmission?\nCountries where non-discrimination laws and regulations\nexist show higher coverage rates of prevention services\nReported expenditures for programs specifically aimed at/involving men who have sex with en (million USD)Figu e 8\nReported expenditures for programs specifically \naimed at/involving men who have sex with men (mil-\nlion USD).Page 5 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9among MSM. The median percentage of MSM who\nreported receiving condoms and knowing where they\ncould be tested was almost 60% in countries with protec-\ntive laws or regulations, compared with countries that do\nnot have such policies (38%) [4].\nWhen countries are classified according to the ILGA clas-\nsification of the policy environment with respect to MSM\n[18], there is a directionally indicative correlation\nbetween higher expenditures from in-country resources\nand MSM supportive policies. Expenditures are lower or\nnot reported in countries classified as having homopho-\nbic policy environments.\nWhat is needed for a more complete response?\nBoth individual and structural level actions are called for.\nA minimum package of services would include: educa-\ntion, behavioral interventions, peer outreach, condom\npromotion and social marketing, lubricants, HIV volun-\ntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infec-\ntions diagnosis and treatment, antiretroviral treatment,\nand access to care and support. Addressing homophobia\nand providing MSM-friendly services in health services\nwould also be required, along with efforts to reduce the\nsocial-structural determinants of HIV risk and vulnerabil-\nity for these men including decriminalization, addressing\nstigma, discrimination and homophobia, and making\nconcrete advances in human rights. This requires funding\ncommensurate with need.\nIn the National AIDS Program of Mexico, expenditures for\nHIV have increased overall from 2001 to 2005. They have\nalso expanded for MSM specific programs (Figure 9). This\nis both good public policy and good evidence-based deci-\nsion making, since MSM remain by far the most at-risk\ngroup in Mexico [10].\nConclusion\nHIV continues to disproportionately affect MSM world-\nwide. The exclusion of MSM from surveillance, targeted\nprevention, and treatment and care still limits the global\nresponse to HIV/AIDS. To improve the human rights and\nhealth of MSM comprehensive advocacy efforts are\nneeded. In the third decade of AIDS it is time to realize the\nequal rights of MSM to access health and other services in\nenvironments that are friendly to their sexual orientation,\nand to recognize that meeting these needs is both a global\npublic health priority, and a compelling human rights\nissue. To achieve the latter, there is a clear need to signifi-\ncantly increase the proportion of HIV resources targeted\ntowards MSM.\nThis paper derives from the plenary speech of the same\nname, presented during the XVII International AIDS Con-\nference (AIDS 2008). AIDS 2008 was perhaps the most\ncomprehensive and intensive International AIDS Confer-\nence focusing on the realities of MSM and HIV globally.\nThe events began with the first International March\nAgainst Homophobia. In the Opening Session of the Con-\nference UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated: \"I urge\nnations to pass laws against homophobia\". Immediately\nafterwards, both the President and Minister of Health of\nMexico addressed directly and openly the need to eradi-\ncate homophobia. The aftermath has been far reaching:\nbefore the finalization of this paper, one of the authors\n(CB) was notified that, because of the denouncement of\nthe violation of the rights of MSM activists in Uganda dur-\ning this plenary, the charges against the detained activists\nwere dropped by the authorities [24].\nThe XVII International AIDS Conference was a milestone,\nwhere the MSM community, along with policy- and deci-\nsion-makers, said: Enough! Evidence must inform poli-\ncies. The epidemiological evidence is striking; it has\nexisted for a long time; and we cannot continue failing to\nrespond. Despite the occasional mention in national\nplans, the inadequate response to MSM has been demon-\nstrated by low coverage rates of basic preventive services\nfor these men, and by the scarcity of targeted spending, –\nstill reaching only one tenth of the estimated resource\nneeds. Such data underscore the urgent need to act now to\nstop homophobia, stigma and discrimination in order to\ndeliver quality and effective services to MSM. When coun-\ntries, international agencies and donors begin to target\ntheir efforts and resources based on the epidemiological\nevidence, and adjust funding levels to be commensurate\nwith the HIV burden among MSM, we will see dramatic\nchanges in the response to HIV in multiple settings. Fund-\ning efficiency can only increase when flows are directed\ntowards populations with the greatest unmet HIV preven-\ntion needs.\nHIV spending on prevention, treatment and care, Mexico, 1995–2005 and detail d spending for programs specifically aimed at men who have ex w th enFigure 9\nHIV spending on prevention, treatment and care, \nMexico, 1995–2005 and detailed spending for pro-\ngrams specifically aimed at men who have sex with \nmen.Page 6 of 7\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nJournal of the International AIDS Society 2008, 11:9 http://www.jiasociety.org/content/11/1/9Publish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours — you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nJose Antonio Izazola-Licea was an employee of the Joint\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) as\nchief of the AIDS Financing and Economics Division at\nthe time of the writing of this paper.
