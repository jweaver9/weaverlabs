Ginsberg’s words echo a sentiment that Generation Z (thoseof the passionate Generation proceeding 1997) are all too familiar with3. Brought up in apost-9/11 world, the weight of a violated nation and an economic crisis became the first birthdaypresents of many ‘Gen Z’ children. However, their unfortunate circumstances are comparable toGinsberg's generation’s adoption of being ‘Beat’ as both generations utilized their young voicesto question social adherence to the norm. Both generations uphold the ‘Dionysian andApollonian’ relationship as employed by William Everson who discusses the necessity ofnonconforming and exuberant Dionysian personalities in the face of an overwhelminglyApollonian and rational society. Everson argues that the vitality of empires rests on the ability tochallenge its institutions - or embracing the Dionysian spirit in balance with Apollonian views -collating the unsuccessful Roman Empire with the similar trajectory of the United States4.Although his analysis focuses on 1950s America, the relationship still remains relevant forGeneration Z among the social conservatism associated with the Trump Administration5.Overwhelmingly, both generations face this Grecian grapple and navigate their respectiveAmerican social environments with similar approaches mirrored in free love and sexuality,5 Barber, Michael, and Jeremy C.

Post-WWII, threats ofcommunism rattled bombs at the democratic foundations of the US, launching Americans intodistress with the rise of McCarthyism. While the constructs of the Red Scare had many politicalimplications, the surge of communism prompted a questioning of sexuality that followed theLavender Scare6. These conditions coupled with the rise of mainstream counterculture, jingoism,and drug use filling the petri dish of individuality upon which the Beats were cultured.Generation Z has employed its generational legacy in an era of increased socialawareness. The introduction of technology has promoted activism between the young generationwhich has brought about a second civil rights movement, prompted legislation targeting theLGBTQ+ community, and strengthened feminist campaigns7. The differences in the culturalcontexts of both generations thus do not follow a linear form of development but rather one thatis parallel with social movements running along with each other amongst the perpendicularattacks of varying historical events.Previous studies about the Beat generation lack the Apollonian and Dionysian dynamicsin conjunction with a comparative analysis between these similar generations. However,highlighting the resemblance of both generations can ultimately provide insight into theproblems plaguing current society. In shedding light on these issues, we can collectively work toremedy them. I assert that there are many parallels between the two considering the socialconcerns affecting both eras and thus, it is important to distinguish the Dionysian and Apollonian7 Ray Brescia.

All in all, while the efforts ofGeneration Z coupled with technology have been more successful in establishing socialrevolutions, the Beat Generation better embodies the Dionysian spirit in their empirical thoughtsand actions.Queer EyesThe technology of the 21st century has ushered in a heightened sense of acceptance andvisibility accompanying the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, questioning, and other sexualidentities (LGBTQ+) community. The adoption of the internet has allowed more exposure tosexuality branding Generation Z as socially progressive8. In a mythic sense, Dionysian values areparticularly evident in the sexual exploration of homosexuality - apparent in both generationsalbeit unequally. Finally, as evident in the prolonging of literature describing homosexualrelationships in the Beat generation, the Dionysian value of sexual exploration is being moredeliberately endorsed by Generation Z.The Dionysian value of sexual exploration was investigated in both generationsdisproportionately. Among the Beat generation, sentimentals of homophobia were still incrediblystrong. The stigma surrounding sexuality in 1950s America prompted William Burroghs to writeQueer9, “as a response to homophobic American culture’s deployment of ‘spectrality’”10. Hisproposed iconoclasm, however, was heavily delayed as his book was mutilated by10 Trask, Michael. “Review of Queer Experimental Literature: The Affective Politics of Bad Reading, by Bradway,Tyler.” College Literature, 2018.https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/2161089966?pq-origsite=primo&accountid=11836.9 Burroughs, William.

The delay inpublishing may have meant that Burroughs avoided public controversy but the late author wasnot immune to the exaggeration and stereotyping that followed Queer with its roots in pedophiliaand toxic masculinity12. As a result, the Beat generation, while attempting to dismantledestructive systems preventing sexual liberty ultimately died at the hands of the societal norm ofthe time. Contrarily, LGBTQ+ representation in media with Generation Z has encouraged aheightened allowance of sexual exploration than what was given to Burroughs. Generation Z haspaved the way for media depictions of homosexuality in TV shows and movies such as QueerEye and Call Me by Your Name. Queer Eye, acclaimed for, “celebrating queer identity”13premiered on Netflix in 2018 and gave viewers a normalized view of LGBTQ+ - not asassimilation but as acceptance. The 2017 movie Call Me by Your Name based on the 2007 novelof the same name by André Aciman 14 drew some parallels to Burrogh’s Queer through themes ofpedophilia but was ultimately praised for its scenic and narrative beauty. Its intense and realisticdepiction of gay lovers further catapulted the film career of Timothée Chalamet whose actingprowess has reverberated throughout Generation Z. The extent of the movie to deliver itsmessages to audiences invested in diverse stories has allowed Generation Z to embrace thedepictions of the LGBTQ+ community far more than in Burroughs’ time. The forthcominginclusion of queer material suggests that sexual exploration led to more discoveries withinGeneration Z than in the Beat Generation.14 Albertsen, Lise.

This is evident from the wayboth Burroughs and Aciman discuss pedophilia but Burroughs’ depiction was used as a weaponagainst homosexuality while Aciman was criticized for his storyline.This Dionysian value of proposed promiscuity due to sexual unconformity is thus moreevident in Generation Z which has uplifted LGBTQ+ preferences throughout social, visual, andliterary media. It is important to note that the stigma surrounding sexuality in the BeatGeneration was heavily tied to political factors. When comparing the political contexts of theBeat Generation and Generation Z, the Red Scare of the 1950s massively contributed to a fear offemininity and associated weakness that accompanied sexual dysphoria. The Red Scare gave riseto the ‘Lavender Scare’ during the Cold War where homosexuality was deemed a national threatfor its supposed ties to communism15. This rampant and idle paranoia plagued the LGBTQ+community of the Beat Generation in a way that has not penetrated the negligible communisticfear of Generation Z. Therefore, this Grecian ideology follows a more classic American fearwhen placed in the circumstance of sexuality among the Beat Generation which providesreasoning for the way Generation Z has a better grasp of the Dionysian value.Overwhelmingly, the use of technology has garnered more acceptance of the LGBTQ+community and thus, upheld the Dionysian value of sexual exploration and unconformity moresuccessfully than the Beat Generation.15 Shibusawa, Naoko. “The Lavender Scare and Empire: Rethinking Cold War Antigay Politics.” DiplomaticHistory, November 2012. https://www.jstor.org/stable/44376170?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents.Isha Chauhan 8Kinsey’s “WAP”: Women and PleasureThe constitutional value of freedom of speech was gratingly tested during the Beatgeneration with the dissemination of sexually charged literature in the form of explicit storiesand promiscuous research. Generation Z, once again strengthened by technology, has alsoembraced the sexual uncensored nature of the Dionysian spirit. The balance between Dionysianand Apollonian constructs is ardently tested in the hypersexualization of women and Blackpeople, education in schools, and the question of pornography as art in both generations. Withthe demand for sexually graphic material spanning decades of history, it comes as no surprisethat both generations have suffered similar reactions of backlash. However, there is a level ofdisparity accompanying how sexual material is portrayed in Generation Z versus among the Beatgeneration.In the Beat Generation, sexual material was faced with much retaliation. Just asBurroughs waited 30 years to publish Queer16 to avoid public harassment, female Beat writerDiane DiPrima took detours in the publishing of her Memoirs of a Beatnik by going through aFrench publishing company for her erotic novel17. The inherent rejection of DiPrima’s work inthe US provided evidence of the conservative culture accompanying the 1950s. DiPrima’srevolutionary erotica thoroughly embodied the sexual and licentious aspects of the Dionysianspirit especially in the face of strong counter-active Apollonian forces in her home country. Toadd to the feminsit ‘love’ movement, Lenore Kandel offered her contribution to the Beatmovement by creating The Love Book which explored spirituality and obscenity to the point of17 DiPrima, Diane.

Furthermore, the release of Kinsey Reportfurther contributed a Dionysian spirit in the face of an Apollonian worldview. The infamousKinsey Reports included the books Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior inthe Human Female and included statistical ‘sex research’ surrounding sexuality, premarital sex,and female pleasure - all true and all appalling to 1950s America19. The Kinsey Report waspossibly more Dionysian than DiPrima’s publication in that it contributed to epiphanies amongthe population who began to realize that women could actually experience pleasure. Kinseyfaced a slew of Apollonian retaliation and was even labeled “demonic”20 with his researchconstantly being discredited and associated with the threat of communism. Similarly to DiPrimaand Kinsey’s Apollonian pushback, Ginsberg faced an obscenity trial with the publication ofHowl and Other Poems. Its provocative material in reference to discussions about homosexualityled to an ‘obscenity trial’ in 1957 against Ginsberg’s publilshing company, San Francisco’s CityLights21. The implication of the subtle sexual material (which was not remotely as profound asDiPrima or Kinsey) was not only a case of conservative Apollonian and sexual Dionysiantensions but a branch of the Red Scare- as if there is anything more ironically American thanrestricting the first amendment for fear of communism. This constant power struggle betweenDionsyian sexual liberty and Apollonian conservatism defined the extent to which sexual activitycould be discussed throughout the Beat Generation. And although the Beat Generation attempted21 Black, Joel Elan. ‘Arrested for Selling Poetry!’ or ‘You Wouldn't Want Your Children Reading This’: TheHistorical Significance of the “Howl” Obscenity Trial.

The 2020 release of “WAP” by artist Cardi B raised manyApollonian retaliation as the sexually unrestrained song became the Tik Tok anthem ofGeneration Z22. Vulgarity in the media has been criticized for decades (see above) but manyconservative listeners took “WAP” as an excuse to demean the feminist movement. As notoriousconservative Ben Shapiro sarcastically stated, “this is what feminism fought for”23. Regardless,radio stations streamed the ‘clean’ version despite public reprisal. Furthermore, the rise of sexualmovies such as the After and 50 Shades of Gray series have accompanied Generation Z into theirsexual maturity. And furthermore, media outlets such as Snapchat have allowed for sexualtransparency - whether welcome or not24. The openness of media to Dionysian sexuality despiteApollonian critique sets Generation Z apart from the Beat Generation. Whereas Apollonianviews often demonized and implicated writers in the Beat Generation, Generation Z haswelcomed more open discussion of sexual topics -for better or for worse. But while bothgenerations have overcome challenges within the sex department, education has been onestationary hurdle in the complete embrace of sexual conversation.The instruction of abstinence in schools from the 1950s well into Generation Z, however,serves as a continuous reminder of conservative Apollonian ideals. Abstinence - deeply rooted in24 Kaviani, Christina Farrah. The Impact of Smartphones on the Sexual Behaviors of Generation Z College Males.Fielding Graduate University, PhD dissertation, 2019.

Whereas this ideal has remained well-founded due to political and religious push inGeneration Z, the Beat Generation was encouraged to embrace abstinence due to societalpressure and conformity. As exemplified in the backlash following the Kinsey report,conservative 1950s American society had a strong disdain for unmarital sex and discussion ofpleasure in conversation. Although rebellious, even the Beat Generation’s sexual rollickingscould not overcome the strong Apollonian values that eventually put their endeavors to bed.Thus, while both generations have made considerable feats in open discussion of sexuallyexplicit material, the reliance on abstinence in education based on societal pressure in the BeatGeneration and religious and political influence in Generation Z has overcome both Dionysianattempts.Moloch and Cop-italismDionysian-prompted inquiry of socio-political climates in both generations hascontinually questioned the capitalistic order that has governed America. The Red Scareencouraged debate about traditional political ideologies during the Beat generation which wasantagonized in Beat literature. Even now, Generation Z is questioning the ethicality of capitalismfor social reform with the rise of billionaires and racial inequalities. But the overwhelmingconformity of American Apollonian society has remained on the side of conventionalgovernance.25 Santelli, John, et al. “Abstinence-Only-Until-Marriage: An Updated Review of U.S. Policies and Programs andTheir Impact.” Journal of Adolescent Health, November 2017. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2017.05.031.Isha Chauhan 12Even in the witch hunt of the Red Scare, the Beat Generation maintained their boldnessby discussing the faults of capitalism in literature. Allen Ginsberg notoriously wrote about thechild-sacrificing deity ‘moloch’ in Howl to describe the monstrous tendencies of capitalism totear into the youth by sending them off to war on the basis of efficiency over humanity26. Amongthe rampant McCarthyism of the era, Ginsberg’s poem was highly controversial. Ginsberg’swords faced harsh criticism during the obscenity trial he faced as well27.Just as Ginsberg’s poem uncovered a universal truth, recognizing the danger of capitalismis a deep rooted concept in American politics that has transcended well into the 21st century withGeneration Z. The ‘internet revolution’ has allowed capitalism throughout online forums tospringboard into institutions like Craigslist and Amazon28. But the internet has also revitalizedawareness surrounding capitalism being integrated in the privatization of prisons. Racialcapitalism is a combination of racist policies among the justice system in order to preservecapitalistic practices including unequally-charged punishment at a price29. American greed ischaracterized in even its most obscure lockboxes as prisons have become corporations tostimulate the ‘criminal justice-industrial complex’30. Many of these tenants of racial capitalismarose among the Black Lives Matter movement, largely headed by Generation Z31. Followingthis revelation, many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have called for defundingthe police in order to sever the direct connection between police corruption and capitalism.31 White, Khadijah. “Black Lives on Campuses Matter: Reflecting on the Rise of the New Black StudentMovement.” Journal of Politics and Culture, September 21, 2016. https://muse.jhu.edu/article/627926.30 Selman, Donna, and Leighton, Paul.

Poetry Foundation, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl.Isha Chauhan 13It is important to mention that while Ginsberg and the Beat Generation tackled capitalismupon exploring communism or defying uniformity, Generation Z’s opposition to capitalism isfocused on the aspects that correlate to deceit among the justice and racial systems present withinthe US. That is not to say that the Beat Generation was unaware of this ever present connectionbut that the observation of capitalism as “blind capitals! demonic industries! [and] spectralnations!”32 was more outstanding than those under the surface.Beyond racial tensions, Generation Z has used technology to reveal the corruption ofcapitalism to uplift the wealth of the upper class while simultaneously promoting poverty. Thesaying ‘eat the rich’ embodies the collective view Generation Z has on unethical monetarygluttony especially in the likes of Jeff Bezos and other billionaires33. Generation Z’s recognitionof the way money can easily remedy many social concerns along with the inhumane workingconditions of the employees working under these billionaires has encouraged a veryGinsberg-esque outlook upon an American capitalistic system that directly opposes the proposed‘American dream’. In this way, Generation Z and the Beat Generation reflect on how capitalismhas caused destruction among the population with little regard for human health. While thesesocial movements in recognizing the faults in American capitalism are compellingBoth movements - literary and literal - consider the dynamic between Dionysianquestioning of society in the face of Apollonian standards. But the stain of the red scare is sointegrated within the American ideal that even the proposition of universal health care became athreat to national order and an immediate outcry against socialism34. This continuous red scare isevidence of Apollonian authority still viewing any rejection of capitalism as a threat as34 Taylor, Alistair. “OUT ON A LIMB: Universal Healthcare Is America's New Red Scare.” Campbell River Mirror[Campbell River, British Columbia], October 1, 2013.33 “Eat The Rich.” University Wire, February 3,2021.https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/2485994863?pq-origsite=primo&accountid=11836.32 Ginsberg, Allen. “Howl.” 1947-1980. Poetry Foundation, https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl.Isha Chauhan 14demonstrated in the obscenity trial and the continuation of privatization and other capitalistpractices. As a result, Apollonian dynamics are much stronger than Dionysian revelations amongboth generations but the continued awareness of capitalistic corruption has ultimatelystrengthened the rising sentiment of weariness towards current economic and social outlooks.Clay, Lula, and the Apple®While much of the Beat generation’s revolution revolved around a white male-dominateddemographic, front runners like Leroy Jones later known as Amiri Baraka developed a strongcultural presence. However, racism remained rampant in the era with interracial marriagecontinually being perceived as distasteful by 1950s American society - often a topic ofinspiration for Jones/Baraka. Similarly, Generation Z is fighting for the degradation of racialstereotypes with the aid of technological advancements like cellphones and social media35.Dionysian values are less related to rebellion with these civil rights approaches and moreintertwined with the fight against socially adhering Apollonian society members in these cases.Both Generation Z and Beat Generation attempted to break down the stereotypessurrounding Black people. Leroy Jones/Amiri Baraka headed the intersectional Beat movementwith his play, Dutchman and the Slave in 1964. Dutchman and the Slave highlighted racialstereotypes of Black men and the dynamic between races prevalent in the 1960s. Jones/Barakahas the main character, Clay, a Black man riding a subway interact with a fellow whitepassenger, Lula. Lula’s flirtatious and sexually extravagant body language are highlighted by hereating an apple - biblically referenced as the ‘forbidden fruit’36. She provokes Clay at one point36 Bent Sørensen. “Dissent as Race War.” Dissent!

At the end of his speech, Lula stabshim, killing him effectively before throwing him out of the train. Jones/Baraka’s legacy beyondhis writing left stamps of progress across the Beat movement even if he himself was unaware ofthe impact.  For one, his marriage and subsequent children with white Beat author Hettie Jonesrepresented Jones/Baraka’s inner struggle with accepting his “Blackness” which he eventuallyconcluded to be unauthentic due to this immersion with white culture. This was represented inhis name change to Amiri Baraka as a nod to his Black identity. He eventually joined manyBlack nationalist movements37. His actions associated with the Civil Rights movement followedwhat was a Dionysian action at the time especially within organizations like the Black Pantherswho embodied Dionysian values to displace Apollonian segregated society.It is important to note that while Apollonian society itself does not consider racism to be“good” it allows it to be acceptable due to its tenants of conformity. The inherent Dionysianspirit nestled in differences in opinion and experience and thus, in racial struggle characterize ananti-Apollonian view38.The unknowing Black power movement was grown to fruition within Jones/Baraka’shumble efforts. They were his personal revolution. This is the primary distinction betweenrecognizing racial dynamics between Black and white people within the Beat Generation andGeneration Z. In Generation Z, the attempt to outline these forces have been intentionalespecially with the previously mentioned Black Lives Matter movement [see Moloch andCop-italism]. Further, another comparison includes the shift in Dionysian ideologies to no longer38 Morsi, Yassir. “Melbourne's Islamic Museum of Australia: The ‘White-Washed 'I'\" as an Apollonian Celebrationof Liberal Myths.” Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs, April 3, 2015. doi:10.1080/13602004.2015.1051755.37 Deborah Thompson. “Keeping up with the Joneses: The Naming of Racial Identities in the AutobiographicalWritings of LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Hettie Jones, and Lisa Jones.” College Literature, January 1, 2002.https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.uky.edu/docview/229646769?pq-origsite=primo&accountid=11836.Isha Chauhan 16include the Civil Rights movement due to the liberation it brought Black people (and thusperceived “goodness” of the movement associated with Apollonian society). Despite thiscategory shift, the new Civil Rights movement following the Black Lives Matter campaign hasfollowed suit with 1960s American distaste for racial equality. Apollonian society generalized bythe Baby Boomer generation has continued a pushback against the movement. Beyond the BlackLives Matter movement, however, technology in Generation Z has created avenues of socialchange. For one, it has stimulated further recognition of Black power and racial disparities. Onesuch instance includes the hashtag “#OscarsSoWhite”39 and the proceeding “GrammysSoWhite”campaigns. Each of these technological revolutions have aimed to identify racial disparities inthe film industry. While the Black Lives Matter movement better embraces Dionysian values ofrebellion with its polarization, these technological revolutions represent subsections of theoverall national movement. As a result, the racial equality campaigns headed by Generation Zare more intertwined than in comparison to the Beat Generation where Leroi Jones/Amiri Barakawas one of the only documented examples of Beat Black literary expression.Beyond Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka there were attempts by diverse authors to becomeplayers in the Beat generation literary game like in the case of Oscar Zeta Acosta40 but hisrejection by most Beat generation literary scholars demonstrates another case of racial disparitywithin the Beat generation that is absent from Generation Z: the rejection of diversity. As aresult, while the Beat Generation includes some aspects of Dionysian values carried upon thebacks of Leroi Jones/Amiri Baraka and his attempts at manifesting acceptance through art,40 A.

But as Everson originally intended,Apollonian and Dionysian thought must act in balance in order to preserve society41. Thus, asfrustrating as the attempts for progressiveness have been, political polarization is necessary fornational diversity and inner advancement. Too much leniency in the form of Dionysian thoughtand action may lead to disorder within a society and can be attributed to “toxic optimism”42. Thephenomenon of “toxic optimism” follows an intrinsic need for faux-happiness; it is a tattoo of‘rose colored glasses’. Dionysius with his extravagance allows for “toxic optimism” in the formof dispassionate flexibility and a ‘go with the flow attitude’ over total complacency43. And whileboth extremes pose their own threats to society, overtly embracing lunacy over rigidness can leadto a dangerous regression of social progress.Generation Z and the Beat Generation’s development of social change by openlydiscussing ‘taboo’ topics in true Dionysian fashion is thus something that must be approachedwith steady pushback from Apollonian society as well as constant discussion. In recognizing thefaults in both rational and lenient reliance, society can remain. However, this brings up a43 Loney, Sydney. “EVERYTHING [Begin Strikethrough]IS[End Strikethrough] Isn't AWESOME.” Chatelaine,January 2, 2021.http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.uky.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ulh&AN=148224792&site=ehost-live&scope=site.42 Steel, Sean. “On the Need for Dionysian Education in Schools Today.” Educational Theory, April 2014.doi:10.1111/edth.12053.41 Rizzo, Fred Frank.

Thisis to question whether the dominance of Dionysian values or Apollonian values wouldeffectively establish a social revolution or dystopia although further analysis would be necessary.All in all, even in the thought of one society triumphing over the other, both the BeatGeneration and Generation Z accepted their actions as the minority in the face of Apollonianorder. While Generation Z has objectively been more successful at destigmatizing social issuesand encouraging progressivism especially with the media and increased use of technology, theBeat Generation’s unknowing social strides better encompass the Dionysian spirit. This isevident in the artists of the Beat Generation who wrote social revolutions from inner struggle, notnecessarily for public change. In the case of Howl44 and Queer45, for example, these literarymovements were simply an attempt at understanding oneself, never intended to spark fires in anew generation. They perfectly capture the irrationality and ‘madness’ of the Dionysian spirit.Conversely, Generation Z’s purposeful organization of online revolutions and protests haveallowed them to channel politics within their values, achieving success in social change on alarger magnitude while supporting Dionysian values.This concludes the final similarity between these two generations as defined by the everconstant presence of Apollonian thought even with inquiry towards free love and sexuality,capitalism and exploration of communism, socialization of drugs, and racial disparity. Aspolarization grows and Apollo and Dionysius continue their centuries old clash of worldviews,one thing remains constant: the continuation of the Beat legacy among the fight forprogressiveness in Generation Z. Even within the differences in both movements with the Beat45 Burroughs, William. Queer. New York: Viking Press, 1985.44 Ginsberg, Allen. “Howl.” 1947-1980.

    "abstract": "Beyond popularized sororities and toga days, ‘Greek life’ has taken on a more ideological meaning when considering the impacts of the Dionysian and Apollonian spirits on Generation Z in comparison to past generations, namely the Beat Generation. The rambunctious Beat Generation characterized by efforts in free love and sexuality, opposition to capitalism and exploration of communism, socialization of drugs, and racial disparity defined the American 1950s. Notorious writers Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac were only some of the representative figures of the Beat Generation but hold great significance when compared to Generation Z which has shared the Beat Generation’s fervor for the Dionysian spirit - or a sense of nonconformity and chaos among a generally uniform or Apollonian society. As consistent with their representative Greek gods, each of the spirits has contributed much to social change movements in both generations but has maintained balance for the preservation of society. In this paper, I compare the dynamic between Dionysian and Apollonian spirits within the Beat Generation and Generation Z. I remark upon the use of technology in the late 2010s to stimulate the Dionysian spirit within Generation Z as well as the literary attempts of Beat Generation writers to push back against Apollonian society in the 1950s. I ultimately argue that while there are many similarities between the Beat Generation and Generation Z in combatting social conformity, the lack of intentionality behind the Beat Generation social movements establishes their concession of the Dionysian spirit as more authentic although Generation Z’s attempts at leveraging the Dionysian spirit to accomplish change have been more successful",
