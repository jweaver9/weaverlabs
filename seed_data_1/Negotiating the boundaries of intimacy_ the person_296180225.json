While much of the literature to \ndate has focused on the supposedly transformative and political nature of \nuniquely asexual practices of intimacy, our findings suggest something \ndifferent.  Rather than seeking to transform the nature of intimate relationships, \nasexual people make pragmatic adjustments and engage in negotiations to \nachieve the forms of physical and emotional intimacy they seek.  We discuss \nthis in relation to three areas: friendships, sex as a practice of intimacy, and \nexclusion from intimacy.  Our findings suggest the importance of not only \nconsidering the social context in which asexual people practice intimacy, but \nalso how the practices in which they engage may be shared with non-asexual \npeople. \nKeywords: asexuality, friendships, practices of intimacy, sex, symbolic \ninteractionism \nResearch into asexuality, defined as low levels of sexual attraction and/or desire, has greatly \nexpanded in the last ten years.  Literature has emerged from sexology (Bogaert 2004), \npsychology (Brotto et al. 2008), health studies (Kim 2010), demography (Prause and Graham \n2007), legal studies (Emens 2013) and social science (Scherrer 2008, Carrigan 2011).  Given \nthe ‘emergent’ nature of both asexuality itself and the research field (Gazzola and Morrison \n2012) it is perhaps unsurprising that early studies have primarily focused on the demarcation \nof asexuality as an identity and community.  In doing so, the ways in which asexual people \nconceive of, and practice, intimacy has been somewhat marginalised.  While, as we shall see, \nsome researchers have highlighted the prevalence of romantic relationships among asexual \npeople, there has been little in-depth discussion of such relationships. \nAt the same time, literature within the sociology of intimacy has, to date, been largely \nneglectful of asexuality.  While this can partly be explained by the ‘newness’ of the topic, it \nis perhaps also indicative of an assumption that romantic intimacy, and the practices \n(Jamieson 1998) it engenders, can be found most strongly in sexual practices.  Sex, including \nconflicts over it, is one of the things said to mark out romantic intimacy, and love, from other \nforms (Gabb 2008:142-3, Carter 2013), helping to define the ‘boundaries’ of intimacy \n(Jamieson 2005).  This connection reaches its zenith in arguments which link changes in sex \nto wider changes in the nature of modernity (Giddens 1992, Bauman 1998). \nThis article brings these two bodies of literature together.  Based upon findings from a \nresearch project on asexual identity and practices of intimacy, we discuss the everyday \npractices, both romantic and non-romantic, upon which asexual people draw in their intimate \nlives.  In doing so, we will temper some of the more radical claims concerning how \n2 \n \nasexuality can ‘remake’ the sphere of intimacy, while suggesting that asexual people frame \ntheir intimate relationships in light of their sexual orientations.  While this group may draw \nupon some practices of intimacy less and others more, it is difficult to claim there are \ndistinctly ‘asexual practices of intimacy’.  We conclude that this opens up further questions \nfor sociological research on asexuality. \nAsexual Studies and Intimacy \nAs we have suggested elsewhere (Scott and Dawson 2015) existing literature on asexuality \ncan be divided into the psychological and the sociological.  In what follows, we outline the \nkey suggestions from both fields in relation to intimacy. \nThe ‘psychological’ literature was first to emerge and here is taken to include studies from \nthe human sciences more broadly.  The earliest studies sought to establish the proportion of \nthe population who were asexual: originally 1% of the population (Bogaert 2004) with later \nsamples suggesting 0.5% (Carrigan 2015:7) or slightly higher if a more inclusive definition \nwas used (Poston and Baumle 2010).  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this encouraged the human \nscience inclination towards the definition and classification of asexuality using scales of \nsexual attraction (Prause and Graham 2007), measures of health (Brotto et al. 2010) or finger \nlength ratios (Yule, Brotto and Gorzalka 2014).  While such studies shared the goal of \ntreating asexuality as a legitimate sexual orientation, they did sometimes medicalise and \npathologise it as a health condition, such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (see \nHinderliter 2013), schizoid personality disorder (Brotto et al. 2010:608), poor health (Poston \nand Baumle, 2010:524), a ‘lack of activitation’ (Prause and Harenski 2014) or as \nautochorissexualism: an ‘identity-less sexuality’, whereby sexual desire involves situations \nnot including that individual (Bogaert 2012:119-120). \nGiven the sometimes clinical focus of these studies, little attention was given to intimacy.  \nSome mention was made of the fact that members of their respective samples had, or were \nhaving, intimate relationships (Bogaert 2012:67-104).  However, even this could sometimes \nbe reversed as a sign of pathology, hence: ‘the finding that one-third of the sample had never \nengaged in a relationship…suggest atypical social functioning which appears to be more \nwidespread than just related to sexual relationships’ (Brotto et al. 2010:608).  This also \nreflected the ontological assumptions of such literature, where the focus was on individual \nassessment rather than an awareness of the social context of asexuality. \nIt is here that the sociological literature, which we take to include gender and queer studies, \nmade its major contribution. Scherrer (2008) highlighted the diversity of asexual identity, \nwhich works across two axes.  The first axis concerns sexual desire: at one end is its non-\npresence, such as in those who unproblematically define as ‘asexual’ or even ‘sex-repulsed’.  \nAt the other end are groups such as those identifying as ‘grey-a’, who exist ‘in the grey area’ \nbetween asexuality and other sexual identities as well as demisexuals, who feel sexual desire \nunder certain circumstances, such as when a relationship develops.  The second axis concerns \nromantic attraction.  Here, one end is defined by the absence of romantic attraction, as in \nthose identifying as ‘aromantic’ while the other end of the scale can be marked by the object \n3 \n \nof romantic attraction (e.g. homo-romantic, hetero-romantic, pan-romantic etc.).  These two \naxes create a complex web of possible and actual asexual identities.  It is important to keep \nthis complexity in mind and see asexuality as a ‘meta-category’ (Chasin 2010), marked by \ndiversity as much as similarity (Carrigan 2011). \nReflecting such diversity, some of Scherrer’s participants suggested how their asexuality \nshaped the forms of intimacy they practiced. For example, one participant claimed ‘I’m \nromantically attracted to the opposite sex, but don’t desire sexual contact. I enjoy cuddling, \nand kissing and even pleasing my wife, but I don’t desire sexual intercourse’ (Scherrer \n2008:627). Furthermore, Carrigan’s (2012) work suggests how, given that the large majority \nof asexual people have romantic relationships with non-asexual individuals, these tend to \ninvolve negotiating the ‘sexual assumption’ of such partners. \nHowever, Carrigan also hints at another stream of literature on asexuality by emphasising the \ntransformative nature of asexual practices of intimacy, since ‘when sexual activity ceases to \nbe the sine qua non of intimacy, an otherwise stable and naturalised boundary between \n“friendship” and “relationship” becomes decidedly fuzzier’ (Carrigan 2012:15).  This creates \nthe need for new forms of language to describe the relationships asexual people engage in, \nbeyond simple ‘single’ and ‘coupled’ definitions (Scherrer 2010a, 2010b).  This chimes with \nwriters such as Fahs (2010), Pryzbolo (2011), Chasin (2013) and Gressgård (2013) who focus \non the political potential of asexuality.  Such writers argue that in disrupting this sexual \nassumption asexuality has the potential to suggest alternative ways of human being and \ninteraction.   For example, in her call for asexuality to proclaim its radical potential and not \nsuccumb to ‘academic conservatism’, Chasin (2013:416) argues: \nIf it can be okay for asexual people to not want sex, maybe we can make it okay for anyone to \nnot want sex. This would be a world where being sexual is no longer mandated as a \nprerequisite of normalcy or intimacy and where nonsexual relationships are recognized and \nvalued \nTherefore, this literature claims that asexuality breaks down the ‘boundaries’ of intimacy \n(Jamieson 2005). Different relationships, most notably friendships and romantic \nrelationships, become less distinct and their similarities throw any distinction into question.  \nImportantly, as the above quotation suggests, these asexual practices are then seen to be \nindicative of more; for these authors, they are (hopefully) the harbinger of further social \ntransformation (Pryzbolo 2013; Kahn 2014). Interestingly, from a different political and \nintellectual perspective, here we have a claim similar to Giddens’ suggestion that same-sex \ncouples were the pioneers of ‘plastic sexuality’ (Giddens 1992:28), which is ‘decentred’ and \n‘freed from the needs of reproduction’ (Giddens 1992:2). Unfortunately, again like Giddens’ \nwork, much of this political literature on asexuality does not make use of empirical evidence.   \nConsequently, although the sociological literature has begun to discuss the relations between \nasexuality and intimacy, in doing so it has either not fully explored the everyday practices of \nintimacy due to limited focus or methodology, or subsumed claims about asexual intimacy \nwithin a wider political argument, without empirical evidence.  Therefore, this paper aims to \n4 \n \nprovide an understanding of the everyday contingent practices of intimacy used by asexual \npeople, a topic that has been neglected. \nMethods \nThe findings below come from a two-year project entitled ‘A Qualitative Exploration of \nAsexual Identities and Practices of Intimacy’, funded by the Leverhulme Trust (grant code \nRPG-2012-575).  The project set out to answer two questions: ‘How do individuals form an \nasexual identity?’ and ‘How is intimacy constructed and maintained in relationships where \none, or both, of the principles identifies as asexual?’.  Our choice of a two part methodology \nreflected these questions. \nFirstly, participants were asked to take part in a biographical interview (Wengraf 2001) which \nsought to explore not just how participants came to an asexual identity, but also how this had \nchanged over time.  We have discussed some of the findings from this approach elsewhere \n(Scott, McDonnell and Dawson, forthcoming); the focus of this paper is primarily on our \nsecond methodological tool: research diaries. \nParticipants who took part in the interview were then asked to fill in a research diary for two \nweeks.  The diary had space for daily entries with three prompts concerning interactions, \nexperiences and thoughts concerning asexuality.  We chose research diaries as a method due \nto their ability to ‘get at’ everyday experiences (Elliott 1997), especially concerning sensitive \ntopic matter (Kenton 2010).  For this reason, diaries have been seen as a valuable tool in \nresearch on intimate lives (Gabb 2009).   \nThe diary questions reflected our understanding of intimate practices as relational, drawing \non the ‘connectedness thesis’, which considers how ‘association remains possible and \ndesirable, as well as how it may take different shapes at different times’ (Smart 2007:189).  \nTogether with our symbolic interactionist approach to the study of asexuality (Scott and \nDawson 2015), means we were interested in seeing how forms of intimacy, and the types of \npractice these create, were negotiated by participants at an everyday level (Jackson and Scott \n2010).  We turned to a symbolic interactionist perspective since we were interested in these \ncontextual and negotiated elements of practices of intimacy.  As we discuss below, \nparticularly significant here is the way in which a normatively sanctioned common ‘definition \nof the situation’ (Thomas and Thomas 1928) shapes expectations concerning the \n‘appropriate’ action in an intimate relationship.  This helped overcome the tendencies \ntowards an individualised focus in the existing literature, expressed either through the natural \nscience desire to classify, or approaches which removed questions of being asexual from the \ncontext of social relations.  Consequently, our focus is on the nature of these relationships \nand the obligations they place on individuals. This is intended to correct to some extent the \naforementioned neglect of everyday practices of asexual intimacy (Carrigan 2015:18).   \nRecruitment and Sample \nResearch into asexuality has both a notable advantage and challenges when it comes to \nrecruitment.  As noted elsewhere (Brotto et al. 2010; Carrigan 2011) the asexual community \n5 \n \nis both heavily informed about, and eager to take part in, research.  To date, the main, and \nmost efficient, way of recruiting participants is via the Asexuality Visibility and Education \nNetwork (AVEN), a website which forms the largest asexual space and community.  AVEN, \nand those involved with it, most prominently the American activist David Jay, have been \ncentral to the increased knowledge, and acceptance, of asexuality (Kim 2010) and have \nhelped facilitate much of the research on the topic to date.  But, the users of AVEN are a \nparticular population, likely to be well-educated, broadly middle class, white, American and \nfemale\n1\n.  Furthermore, those recruited via AVEN are likely to use the definitions and \ndiscourses around asexuality found on that site (Hinderliter 2009:620). \nTherefore, while we did post a call for participants on the AVEN website, we also sought out \nother avenues.  Our first was by publishing a piece on asexuality on the Huffington Post \nwhich included a contact for any interested participants (Dawson 2013).  We also contacted \nLGBTQ groups, posted notices in public spaces and found the announcement was reposted \non various internet fora, such as Tumblr and Twitter.  There was also an inevitable element of \nsnowball sampling, as participants contacted others whom they thought may be interested. \nThe result of this was over 150 expressions of interest, while we unfortunately only had \nresources for 50 participants.  Noticing that our population was still skewed to the \ndemographics of previous studies, we first engaged in purposive sampling, by contacting all \nthose who did not match those characteristics (most notably, men and/or people over the age \nof 30).  We then used a random number generator to bring our total sample to 50.  \nThese 50 participants all took part in the interview and were offered the chance of completing \nthe diary; 27 agreed to do so.  Of this 27, the large majority were ‘white’2, 20 were aged \nbetween 18-29 and 18 had a university degree.  From these participants we also found eight \ndifferent gender identities: ‘female’ was the most common (18) followed by ‘male’ (3) then \none each identifying with gender identities including ‘cismale’, ‘agender’ and ‘androgynous’.  \nTherefore, despite our best efforts, our sample was largely white, young, female and middle \nclass (if we accept level of education as a marker of class).  Given that ours is not the first \nstudy on asexuality to have had such a sample, we would suggest that this partly reflects the \ndemographic profile of the community, and partly the online spaces from which most \nparticipants were found.  Since there is no reason to assume the practices of asexuality are \nmore prevalent among this demographic grouping we would suggest that having access to the \nlabel ‘asexual’, and adopting it as a form of identity, may imply the resources not just to \naccess such spaces but also to adopt the terminology used there\n3\n.   \nOur sample also showed the diversity of sexual orientation among the asexual group, with the \n27 participants producing 17 different sexual orientations. The only repeated identities were \n                                                          \n1\n As suggested by the most recent survey of AVEN members (Ginoza et al. 2014). \n2\n Demographic detail was provided by self-completion, meaning participants wrote a variety of different ethnic \nidentities.  Saying the large majority were white is the extent of the summary we can offer here without listing \nthe various identities offered. The same is true for some of the following categories. \n3\n We did try to overcome this but not restricting our recruitment material to just those who identified as asexual, \nincluding people ‘who experience little or no sexual attraction or desire’, but it seems this was not entirely \nsuccessful. \n6 \n \n‘aromantic asexual’ (6), ‘heteroromantic asexual’ (4) and ‘asexual’ (3).  We also found \nparticipants reflecting the variety of asexual identities, including ‘grey asexual’, ‘panromantic \ndemisexual’, ‘mostly asexual’, ‘repulsed heteroromantic asexual’ and, ‘hetero-romantic, \npandemiromantic, polyamorous flexible asexual’.  As we shall see, it is important to highlight \nthe diversity of personal asexual identities, not just to be true to participants but also because \nit makes generalisations about ‘asexuals’ as a group problematic.  Some asexual individuals \n(such as our heteroromantic or grey asexual participants) may have more in common with \nheterosexual people than with our aromantic or repulsed participants, concerning romantic \nintimacy.  \nFindings \nFirstly, our data indicated that asexual people experience full and varied intimate lives, \nincluding romantic relationships, friendships and family relationships. There was also \nmention of non-human forms of intimacy, such as relations with pets (Charles and Davies \n2008), for example Freya’s report that lying on the sofa with her dog fills ‘my daily need of \ncloseness to another creature’.  \nIn many ways this is not a ‘finding’ since as researchers we did not expect anything else, and \nthere is very little evidence to indicate some sort of ‘deficit of intimacy’ among asexual \npeople.  However, it is still an important statement to make, given some of the claims in the \naforementioned literature about asexual ‘atypical social functioning’.  This leads to a wider \npoint, discussed by Kim (2010), that the desire for, or engagement in, sex, is not a \ncompulsory part of a ‘healthy’ lifestyle.  But, below we will question to what extent this is a \npolarised choice between ‘sex or no sex’. \nThere are three key themes which emerged: friendship, sex as a practice of intimacy, and \nexclusion from intimate practices.  However, these themes incorporate many other areas of \nasexual intimate lives, including physical intimacy, the nature of romance, conflict, \nconsensus, negotiation and different expectations. \nFriendships \nFriends were the most commonly mentioned source of intimacy in the diaries.  However, this \nmay reflect the nature of the method and the sample (being relatively young people).  More \nspecifically though, our data relate to the aforementioned claims that asexuality breaks down \nthe boundaries of intimacy. \nWhile friends were frequently invoked as a source of emotional intimacy, it was marked how \noften participants also spoke of them as a source of physical intimacy.  This was sometimes \nattributed explicitly to their asexuality, as in Delphi’s conversation with a friend: \nNell stayed to chat for a while. She’s just broken up with her partner and I wanted to see how \nshe was doing. We had a hug, she kissed my hair, and I was holding her hand for a bit while \nshe was talking to me. Being openly asexual seems to make other people around me feel more \ncomfortable expressing their platonic affection for me in physical ways that are normally only \nreserved for romance \n7 \n \nHere, for Delphi, friends provided forms of physical intimacy which, were she not asexual, \nwould be ‘misread’ as signs of romantic/sexual attraction.  This desire for physical intimacy, \nand its availability from friends, was a common claim, epitomised by Ed, who said ‘basically, \nI want to cuddle with other people’.   \nThis could be seen to echo the claims about asexuality redrawing, and potentially blurring, \nthe boundaries of intimacy: with sex removed from the equation, the distinction between \n‘friends’ and ‘partners’, becomes less clear.  However, there are two caveats we would add to \nthis interpretation.  Firstly, it relies upon friends being comfortable with the idea of asexuality \nand accepting this orientation as valid.  Given reports of discrimination towards asexual \npeople (MacInnis and Hodson 2013), we should not assume that this acceptance is always \nforthcoming.  Unfortunately, we found examples of this, such as Martha, whose close friend \nseemed accepting of her asexuality before one day saying that he did not believe it was real, \nand offering to ‘throw a fuck her way’4.  Therefore, the use of friendships as sources of \nphysical intimacy ultimately relies upon a common definition of the situation (Thomas and \nThomas 1928) – i.e. both partners to the relationship have to operate with common \nassumptions of what is ‘allowable’ within a friendship, while accepting asexuality as a \n‘legitimate’ orientation.  Some of our participants were able to reach such a consensus, while \nsome, such as Liam, who enjoyed touching, hugging and sometimes massaging his friends, \nfaced more difficulties. \nSecondly, the suggestion that asexual practices of intimacy involve transcending boundaries \nof intimacy implies that asexual people currently operate outside or beyond these.  However, \nwhat our participants spoke of was a careful awareness of, and negotiation around, the \ndifferent boundaries of intimacy; the lines between their ‘friends’ and (actual or imagined) \n‘romantic partners’ were carefully monitored rather than transcended.   \nAn example of this comes from Freya, who could ostensibly be seen to reflect the \n‘transformative’ nature of asexual practices of intimacy. She had been in a semi-poly \nrelationship with a married couple, during which time she said had had a ‘wife, a girlfriend \nand a mistress’.  In her interview she said that she preferred always being someone’s ‘second \nchoice’ and that this arrangement created ‘a relationship where I’m considered family’. \nHowever, this story of a day out with her friend indicates something more complex: \nWhen we walked together through a very crowded place she took my hand.  It startled me \nslightly because she never does that. She usually takes me by the arm as we walk \ntogether…but she never takes my hand.  I think she considers it a too intimate gesture, \nsomething you save for a romantic partner.  So that was…strange \nFreya’s confusion at her friend’s actions represent a trend we identified amongst participants, \nto be monitoring, rather than transgressing, the boundaries of intimacy.  While in her case this \nwas about questioning the actions of her friends, we found a broader tendency towards \n                                                          \n4\n That being said, it was marked how often it was friends participants discussed their asexuality with rather than \nfamily members who were seen, partly due to differences of generations, to ‘not understand’.  This can be seen \nin Bea’s vexation at her mum’s questioning of why she would buy lingerie when she has no sexual partner to \nshow it to or Martha’s feeling that she was a ‘shit daughter’ due to the low probability of her having children.   \n8 \n \nensuring that behaviour participants considered to be acts of ‘friendly’ physical intimacy \nwere not interpreted as indicators of something ‘more’.  For example, Maisie spoke about \nhow when she met a man she was ‘conscious of every action/gesture/word we exchanged’ \nsince ‘flirting between an asexual and a non-asexual can mean potentially mixed signals’.    \nSuch concerns with negotiating and monitoring the boundaries of intimacy, rather than \nseeking to reject the divide between ‘friends’ and ‘partners’, could then cause problems for \nasexual people.  Thus Carla complained one day that she was experiencing: \nSame problems as usual. Intimacy, intimacy, intimacy. Need. Need. Friendship. Wanting to \nbe close. Making awkwardness. Being sexually confusing to other people.  Being….Almost \nmaking sexual overtures out of a need for intimacy. Knowing that that’s not what it’s really \nabout \nParticipants highlighted how the difficulties of negotiating such physically, yet not sexually, \nintimate relationships would sometimes leave them feeling, as Freya put it, ‘touch-deprived’. \nThis does not detract from the fact that our participants expressed very high levels of \nintimacy, including disclosing intimacy (Jamieson 1998), with friends.  Our participants’ \naccounts in many ways resemble claims that friendships are the ‘ideal relationship’ of late \nmodern times (Spencer and Pahl 2006).  However, akin to scholars critical of these optimistic \nclaims (Heaphy and Davies 2012), we want to emphasise that the nature of friendships for \nasexual people sometimes involves complex negotiations around physical intimacy.  A \nsingular, idealised notion of friendship ‘does not allow for messy and asymmetrical periods \nof needing practical help or feeling dependent or needy which are routine occurrences…in \nsome friendships’ (Jamieson 1998:105), such as the desire for physical intimacy. \nSex as a Practice of Intimacy \nReflective of previous research (Carrigan 2012), only one participant was having a (long-\ndistance) relationship with another asexual person who shared their romantic and sexual \norientation.  While a few were in relationships with those of different asexual orientations, \nthe large majority of those in relationships were with persons of a different sexual orientation. \nThis meant that sex was currently practised by roughly a third of our participants in the \nresearch diaries.  Again, here our findings reflect previous studies which have highlighted the \nextent to which asexual people engage in sexual activity (Scherrer 2008, Van Houdenhove \n2014).  What we add is an awareness of the reason why asexual people may do so.  Given the \naforementioned diversity of asexual identities, there are some, such as those identifying as \ndemisexual and grey-a, who will experience forms of sexual desire at certain points, and so \ntheir active sex life should not be a surprise.  In what follows, however, we primarily \ncomment on those who experience romantic, though not sexual, attraction. \nOne explanation of why asexual people engage in sexual activity is societal pressure and \nexpectation. For example, Fahs (2010:456) claims that ‘social desirability and economics \ndrive asexual people into relationships despite lack of sexual attraction or arousal’.  We did \nfind some evidence of this, most prominently in the story of Idra, who was in a relationship \n9 \n \nthat, while she was completing the diary, was in its relatively early stages. Idra had made the \ndecision not to tell her partner Broc about her asexuality, since ‘in the past it hasn’t been \nreceived well by my friends and family’ and instead had decided to ‘just go with the motions \nand do what should be the reaction of “normal” couples’.  In particular, she was keen that he \nshould not know at this point, since ‘I like him and I don’t want him to know that more than a \ncouple kisses is something that doesn’t interest me and I don’t want him to take it \npersonally’.  In this sense, she adopted strategies of ‘passing’ in order to conceal what she \nconsidered a stigmatising attribute (Goffman 1963).  The pressures on Idra had been relieved, \nand her ability to pass enhanced, by the fact Broc had been sharing a home which offered \nlittle privacy for the two of them to be alone.  However, this passing became more difficult \nwhen Broc moved to his own house and wanted to be more sexually intimate. After spending \nher first night there, Idra wrote: \nSpending the night with Broc in his new place was an issue; issue I’m not sure is the right \nword but I can’t think of another one. Having sex is something that we do because I succumb \nto peer pressure and want to be normal so I go ahead with it. I just wish that I knew how to \napproach the subject with him and then even know what to say if I did \nHere we see the difficulties of negotiating sex as an open issue when the definition of the \nsituation, a romantic relationship, demands it.  However, this story also shows the need to \nmove away from blanket statements such as that offered by Fahs.  While she did feel pressure \nto have sex Idra had not been ‘driven’ into a relationship; she wanted to be with Broc, though \nat the moment some practices within that relationship were not to her liking.  Others, such as \nwhen they danced together and chatted about their families one night on their university \ncampus, were. \nHowever, we also found other negotiations around sex in relationships, best illustrated by the \nstory of Simone.  Simone had been in a relationship with George for a few months which \nincluded sex.  They had developed some nonverbal signals for when Simone was willing to \nengage in sex but she was also very aware of how George may desire sex occasionally, \nleading to the following story: \nLast night I had hoped to have sex with George, mostly because it’s been a while and we \nweren’t able to last time we saw each other. I had an infection a few days ago but it seemed to \nbe better, but it turned out penetration was still painful for me. He noticed my cringing and \nstopped. I was willing to give him a blowjob anyway, but he didn’t ask for one.  \nFor Simone, having sex was something she did for the good of the relationship as a unit and \nbecause it was something she could do to make George happy.  It would be too simplistic, \nand an underestimation of Simone’s agency, to see this as something she was ‘forced’ or \n‘driven’ to do.  Instead, it reflects the fact that relationships create a certain definition of the \nsituation and expectations upon actors.  These same actors can, within limits, negotiate such \nexpectations, but also may embrace them as something they want to do. \nSimone and Idra represent two opposite ends of the continuum between those who offer sex \nas a valued part of the relationship and those who engage in sex, though not romantic \n10 \n \nrelationships generally, due to pressure.  Many of our participants who engaged in sex often \nended up somewhere between these two poles, such as Ed.  Ed had not learned about \nasexuality until his early forties: his marriage dissolved soon after.  However, his ex-wife \ncontinued to live with him, and although they had separate bedrooms they would sometimes \nsleep together, which could involve sex, though often, reflecting Ed’s desire for physical \nintimacy, would take the form of cuddling.  Nevertheless, much like the confusion with \nfriends mentioned above, the cuddling could sometimes take on another form: \nWell, during the cuddling, she was hinting that she wanted to have sex with me.  Truthfully, I \nwasn’t interested. However, it had been a couple months since she had asked before, and I \ncouldn’t figure out a way to get out of it without hurting her feelings. Finally, I just gave in. I \nmean, it didn’t hurt me or anything, but I just wasn’t interested \nWhile Ed would, as in the above, sometimes acquiesce to his ex-wife’s requests for sex – \nindeed, towards the end of his diary Ed and his ex-wife were considering become part of a \npolyamorous relationship with another man she had met – he increasingly developed ways of \navoiding being in a situation where sex was possible, for example by getting dressed before \nshe woke up. \nTherefore, sex as a practice of intimacy occupied different positions in the lives of our \nparticipants. However, in all cases, it was a contextual practice of intimacy (Jamieson 1998) \ncarved out within the circumstances of a wider relationship.  It is only by understanding the \nnature of the relationship of which it is part that we can appreciate its place alongside other \npractices of intimacy in the lives of asexual people, since ‘to closely describe these limits is \nto closely study the social relations of the people who draw them’ (Goffman 1983:46).  In \nshort, we cannot assume sex is unwillingly performed by asexual people.  This is true not \nonly of those who do experience sexual attraction, but also of others involved in negotiations \nwith non-asexual partners. \nHowever, for many of our participants, sex was not a practice of intimacy they engaged in.  \nFor our sex-repulsed/aromantic participants this was a choice, while for others it was a \ncircumstance: they had not yet been in relationships where this had been a consideration.  \nNevertheless, it could become one.  Many diaries recounted discussions with friends and \nquestions about asexuality, a frequent one being whether their asexual friend would have sex \nwith a partner.  Answers to this reflected the discussion above, that they would, to please \ntheir partner and/or for the good of the relationship.  This would often lead to a worry \nexpressed by Delphi that ‘even if I was prepared to have sex, how could my awkward \nfumblings compare with an allosexual\n5\n partner who felt real desire and knew instinctively \nwhat to do?’.  In this sense participants such as Delphi suggested a comparison with a \n‘competent other’ who appeared to understand the unspoken rules (Scott 2007), a situation \nunavailable to them due to their asexuality.   \nAlthough asexuality shaped our participants’ views of sex, the actual practices they adopted \nare not unique to asexual people.  After all, non-asexual people sometimes have sex in \n                                                          \n5\n ‘Allosexual’ is a term sometimes used in asexual spaces to refer to those who are not asexual. \n11 \n \nrelationships when they do not really want to, ‘for the good of the relationship’ (Gabb \n2008:143), people who have not had sex worry about their relative lack of competence in \nrelation to their more experienced peers (Tolman 2005), and so on.  Without wanting to \nmarginalise the ways in which these practices are experienced and ‘framed’ (Morgan 2010) \nby asexual people we do want to highlight that what goes on in such relationships is not \nautomatically unique to asexual people.  We return to this point in the conclusion. \nExclusion from Practices of Intimacy \nAs we have seen, our participants lived full intimate lives, including both friendships with the \nnegotiation of physical intimacy, and romantic relationships which may include sex.  \nHowever, they also reported feelings of social exclusion from dominant conceptions of \nintimate life and practice. \nWe have already seen one instance of this: Delphi’s worries that her ‘awkward fumblings’ \nwould lessen her attractiveness to a non-asexual partner.  Indeed, Delphi later experienced \nthis after a friend kissed her at a club and she felt awkward, since ‘this wasn’t going to lead to \nus hooking up’. Similar experiences were reported by other participants.  For example, \nCarmel had met Ned, and they quickly realised they were attracted to each other.  However, \nCarmel spoke of a ‘disconnect when it comes to sexuality’ which meant that they never \nentered a relationship, despite their mutual attraction.  Ed also wrote about his realisation that \nhis ex-wife had cheated on him due to his lack of sexual desire\n6\n.  Meanwhile, Simon \nsuggested that although he could ‘understand sexual attraction in theory’ his lack of practical \nexperience meant he found it difficult to console his friend after her messy break-up.  \nA lack of felt expertise and/or desire and a disconnection from the expectations of others led \nto feeling excluded from some areas of intimate life, or practices of intimacy.  Maisie spoke \nabout the difficulty of finding an ‘ACE soulmate’7 who would share the same expectations \nand practices.  Indeed, it was notable how few of our participants even considered this an \noption, despite the presence of online asexual dating spaces, such as Acebook and Platonic \nPartners.  Some saw singledom as their fate, for better or worse. \nHowever, it is dangerous to assign such exclusion to ‘asexuality’ and important to recognise \nthat asexual people live complex lives of intersecting identities, which may have an equal or \ngreater impact on their intimate practices. A good example of this came from Ella, who was \nour oldest participant at 59.  Like other older people who live alone, she had a wide network \nof friends while also experiencing some instances of isolation (Jamieson and Simpson \n2013:182-4). This was illustrated in the following story of a friend’s wedding: \nI was at a table with a younger couple and 2 men in their early 40s…I and one of the men, \nKane, had sat down as far as we could from the speakers.  We chatted a bit.  Then I got up to \nget a lemonade…When I got back to the table, my place had been moved to the opposite side \n                                                          \n6\n Although Ed was the only participant to have experienced this directly it was a fear for other participants, \nmeaning some left the possibility open of a polyamorous relationship.  In this sense we found some potential \nevidence in support of Scherer’s (2010a) claim for the link between asexuality and polyamory. \n7\n ‘ACE’ is a term often used among the asexual community as an alternative to ‘asexual’. \n12 \n \nof the circular table, closer to the speakers, and the couple and other man had joined Kane. \nThey were chatting away and there was not even the slightest acknowledgement when I \nreturned to the table. Such is the life for an older, single woman. Is it asexuality at work, age, \nor just rudeness? Who knows? \nHere, Ella’s age could be seen to limit her interaction with potential friends and partners.  \nUndoubtedly her experiences were partly shaped by her asexuality, for example many of her \nfemale friends of the same age had formed ‘mommy groups’ to maintain their friendships, \nfrom which she felt excluded\n8\n.  But, in this instance, it was her status as an ‘older, single \nwoman’ which seemed to shape the interaction.  Such stories, showing the intersection \nbetween asexuality and older age, have been invisible in previous research, due to its focus \non younger people. \nFurthermore, given the diversity of asexual identities, we should not assume a commonality \nof such exclusion.  Martha was an aromantic asexual and was one of the few to have asexual \nfriends beyond online spaces.  She had met John by arranging to meet for coffee via AVEN.  \nOnce she arrived, she quickly realised that John, who was heretoromantic, had imagined the \nmeeting to be a date. Once she told him she was aromantic he initially seemed content but \nbecame more irritated, before finally saying, ‘it would be so much easier if I could date an \nasexual but no – you’re unavailable still.  You aromantics!’.  Therefore, although Martha and \nJohn were both ‘asexual’, their differing identities within this meta-category (Chasin 2010) \nfundamentally shaped how they imagined their interaction to occur\n9\n.  This is another example \nof the disconnection between our personal desires and the normative, socially sanctioned, \ndefinitions of the situation. \nWithout wishing to understate the ways in which asexuality can exclude its holders from \npractices of intimacy or make certain relationships difficult to form, such a claim should \nalways take account of the intersecting identities held by that group (as in the case of Ella) or \nthe complex and different forms of intimate practices such an identity produces (such as the \ncases of Martha and John).  As we suggest below, these two points have a broader \nsignificance. \nConclusion \nThis article has, based upon findings from research diaries, detailed the practices of intimacy \nused by asexual people.  In particular, we have focused on three themes present in the diaries: \nthe centrality of friendships, including for physical intimacy; the role of sex as practice of \nintimacy; and the ways in which asexual people can feel excluded from intimate practices.  In \ndoing so we have emphasised that the ways in which asexual people practice intimacy have \nto be understood within the context of the relationship of which it is part. This supports the \n‘connected’ thesis of intimacy, as opposed to individualised conceptions (Smart 2007).  It is \n                                                          \n8\n Of course, being asexual does not mandate being childless, in the same way being heterosexual does not \nguarantee having them. \n9\n We should also be careful to ascribe exclusion when a lack of intimacy may be a choice, as in the case of Lisa.  \nShe answered no to the questions on the diary, every day, for two weeks. Reflecting on this she said her \nresponse indicated that, as an ‘asocial’ person, ‘I don’t particularly want to feel close to people’.   \n13 \n \nnot sufficient to explain the forms of intimacy favoured by asexual people without also \nrecognising the way their intimate others adjust to, negotiate, or reject such practices.  This in \nturn demonstrates the negotiated elements of interaction and the value of a symbolic \ninteractionist approach (Blumer 1969; Jackson and Scott 2010; Scott and Dawson 2015).  \nDelphi’s physically intimate friendships and Carla’s continued frustration at having her \n‘friend’ signals misread as sexual, were both shaped by the negotiations they are able, or \nunable, to undertake with significant others (Mead 1934). \nThere are three implications to take from our findings.  Firstly, the claim that asexual people \nare engaged in radical practices which seek to transcend or negate the boundaries of intimacy \nis not borne out by our data.  As we have seen, our participants were very much aware of \nsuch boundaries and sought to stick within them, rather than critique them.  In this sense, we \nwould echo claims that, while sociologists have often wished for people to be part of the \n‘vanguard’ in their personal lives, they have more often than not been ‘pragmatists’ (Duncan \n2011). Lay conceptions of love do not always match the overly optimistic or pessimistic \nviews of much social theory (Carter 2013).  Secondly, we highlight the intimate connection \nbetween personal asexual identity and intimacy.  For our participants, the practices they were \nwilling or even eager to engage in were framed by where they identified along the sexual and \nromantic attraction axes.  This opened up potential relationship forms (such as physically \nintimate friendships) but also closed down future possibilities (as in concerns about sexual \nexperience).  Therefore, the connection between asexual identity and intimacy both opens up, \nand forecloses, potentialities.  Some participants seemed to have their asexuality rejected as a \nlegitimate social identity, as in Martha’s friend or Idra’s worries about Broc’s reaction.  \nThe third finding however is the key one: namely, that from the above it is difficult to claim \nthere are distinctively ‘asexual practices of intimacy’, as opposed to ‘practices of intimacy \nthat asexual people draw upon more frequently’.  The types of intimate practices engaged in \nare not inherently linked to being ‘asexual people’ as a group (leaving aside whether such a \ndiverse set of individuals can be seen as a ‘group’), but rather can be found across many \nsexualities. While our participants, like others who lack established scripts for their sexuality, \nmay have to engage in ‘life experiments’ in order to realise their ideal forms of intimacy \n(Weeks, Heaphy and Donovan 2001), it would be inaccurate to claim their negotiations are \nentirely unique.  This can be seen especially in negotiations around sex, which are not limited \nto relationships involving asexual people.  Rather than treating asexual intimate lives as \npotential harbingers of radical change, the focus should be on exploring the intersection of  \nintimate practices with other life circumstances (such as age and class background ) and other \nsexual identities.  This leads to a wider point for sociologists of not automatically accepting \nthe ontological permanence of categories in which individuals can be placed.  Instead, as our \nsymbolic interactionist approach has shown, being aware of the contingent negotiations and \nexpectations of social relationships with significant others challenges the assumed boundaries \nbetween groups, revealing similarity as much as difference.  Thus while asexual people face \nsome particular circumstances when it comes to intimate relationships, the negotiations and \nfrustrations they face are not unique.   \nReferences \n14 \n \nBauman, Z.

    "abstract": "This paper uses findings from research diaries to explore the use of practices of intimacy among asexual people.  While much of the literature to date has focused on the supposedly transformative and political nature of uniquely asexual practices of intimacy, our findings suggest something different.  Rather than seeking to transform the nature of intimate relationships, asexual people make pragmatic adjustments and engage in negotiations to achieve the forms of physical and emotional intimacy they seek.  We discuss this in relation to three areas: friendships, sex as a practice of intimacy, and exclusion from intimacy.  Our findings suggest the importance of not only considering the social context in which asexual people practice intimacy, but also how the practices in which they engage may be shared with non-asexual people",
