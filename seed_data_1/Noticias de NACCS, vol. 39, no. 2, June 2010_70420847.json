NNMC, which is considered a \"Hispanic-serving\" institution, also has a campus in El Rito.Volume 39, Number 2, June 2010Continued on page 7 Rusty Barceló begins Presidency of Northern New MexicoInside Noticias  de NACCSPage 3 News from Our MembershipPage 4Unos RecuerdosPage 5ReportsPage 8 & 10ResolutionsPage 14Conference Expenses & IncomeAbout three weeks after the 2010 NACCS Annual Conference in Seattle, Governor Jan Brewer (R) of Arizona signed SB1070; later, she signed HB2281. SB1070 criminalizes the undocumented immigrant; under current federal law being in the United States without legal permission is a civil violation and not a crime. The law also directs local law enforcement personnel to apprehend and detain anyone suspected of \"being an illegal alien,\" which will certainly en-gender racial profiling that has already been the de facto policy of Sheriff Arpaio in Maricopa County. HB2281 would ban the teaching of ethnic studies in Arizona public schools and is di-rected against the hugely successful Mexican American Studies Program of the Tucson Unified School District. In a quick response to these actions, I drafted a state-ment for NACCS that was released on May 4. The NACCS Statement on 1070, can be downloaded from the naccs.org home page. The NACCS Statement was prepared as an open letter to Governor Brewer and the people of Arizona. The statement very quickly went \"viral\" and was re-posted on numerous blogs and websites.

Having served on the Board as Treasurer and Tejas Representative I am aware of the work commitment required and hope to meet my obligations. The first formal activity I was a part of was the monthly conference call Board meeting. During the meeting a number of items were discussed that can have positive results for the NACCS membership. At the same time, the organization faces chal-lenges. These will be addressed in other sections of the newsletter and in future newsletters.My first duty as Chair-Elect was to de-termine the theme for the 2011 NACCS conference. As I took a couple of days to consider possible themes, there were many viable points of departure. In the end I selected education as a founda-tional theme. From there I developed a working definition of education and a purpose. The result is found below. It was my intention to keep the theme in a broad perspective given that the diver-sity of disciplines and interests found among the NACCS membership. Also, I believe each of us needs to see ourselves as educators whether in the classroom or in the streets.We at times fail to acknowledge that education does not only occur between four walls. It is important to point out that there are issues affecting students in schools such as Arizona’s attempt to ban ethnic studies, Texas’ whitening of social studies curriculum, the effects of high stakes testing on all students, and the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, among others. Formal education Â Chair-Elect:Sites of Education for Social Justice: 2011 PasadenaBy Jaime H. Garcia, Chair-Elect 2011-2012Continued on page 15The month of June will be done by the time you read this and usually at this time I start to get concerned about our conference site for the following year. This year we are fortunate to have gotten ahead of the schedule and we all know our 2011 site is Pasadena, California. Thus, at this point we are discussing preparations to search for the 2012 site, which is in the Midwest. Seems like a long way off but it comes up quickly. We began to scout during the meetings in Seattle, and will have a report for the midyear meetings.Even though NACCS is not on the top of my \"to do list\" right now it is at the forefront of my memory in part because of the World Cup. The first World Cup I experienced—truly expe-rienced—was in 1998 during the Mexico City conference. It was my first year as NACCS coordinator having survived the grueling 1997 Sacramento Conference as Northern California Foco Representative. I will never forget the 1998 conference for many reasons, but a major one was the excitement of el Mundial. The dissonance of being in the heart of a Spanish speaking community where the excitement was in the air and the feel of rejoicing at every exploding \"GOL\" was amazing.

REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking, an affiliate of the American Library Associa-tion, announced that Susana Hinojosa and Oralia Garza de Cortés as the 2010 Arnulfo D. Trejo Librarians of the Year (LOTY). The award is named in honor of Dr. Arnulfo D. Trejo, the founder and first president of REFORMA. This is only the second time that the LOTY has been shared by two librarians. Susana Hinojosa, recently retired as government documents, social sciences and outreach librarian at UC Berkeley’s Doe Library, where she was employed for more than 38 years. In addition to all of her work to benefit libraries and REFORMA, Susana worked with NACCS for many years helping us with our conference exhibits. Hinojosa worked to defend the rights and improve the working conditions of all system librarians. Her steadfast dedi-cation to equity, fairness, teaching, men-torship and long-term service to libraries and organizations focusing on Chicanas and Chicanos is recognized by this award. Our students and faculty at UC Berkeley miss her greatly. UCB has lost a great Chicana librarian. For us, Susana’s work with our conference exhibitors is a foundation we still work from. She first joined our team at the 1997 Sacramento NACCS and worked several conferences afterwards. We are pleased to see our colleague receive this recognition.Book AnnouncementsThe inaugural 2010 NACCS-Tejas Book Award recipient is Dr. Raúl A.

We were able to visit Karin at the hospital before she passed. This allowed us to begin to refl ect on her lifetime of contri-butions to Chicana/o Studies. She contrib-uted to the fi eld of Chicana/o Studies for over 35 years at California State University at Northridge. This university is the home to one of the most recognized departments of Chicana/o Studies. It is safe to say that Karin touched the lives of the tens of thou-sands that passed through that department and university.Karin was a legend, even people who did not personally know Karin had heard of the Chicana librarian at Northridge. From the beginning of her tenure at CSUN Karin worked in the Teacher Curriculum Center. Looking back it is easy to see the connec-tion between her work there and her life-long commitment to learning in general and the classes she taught about writing, research and using the library. That passion for learning extended into her reference work and mentoring of countless students.She was an author-ity within Chicana/o Studies librarianship. Since 1972 Karin helped build the Chicano collections, provided reference assistance and taught thousands of students how to conduct research in the discipline. It was in part her pioneering work that laid the base for a recent Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program Grant awarded to Northridge to develop Chicana/o archival collections. Karin’s commitment to fostering information lit-eracy in her students led her to develop the class \"Introduction to Research Methods in Chicana/o Studies\" which she taught every semester since 1977. Her passion to serve and help extended beyond the university into local and national communities.Karin had been one of the original indexers for the Chicano Periodical Index, which is now the Chicano Database and contributed to Chicano/LatinoNet. She also contributed to the bibliographic record by preparing a yearly list of recent Chicana/o Studies acquisitions the library had made. While this list was principally intended for the faculty it became widely used as a selection tool by librarians through-out the nation.Karin also served on the Chicano Studies curriculum and Masters Committee in Chicano Studies. Mary Pardo notes that she was part of the fabric of the department.Juan Bruce NovoaBy Rolando Hinojosa-SmithJune 15, 2010—Yesterday, I received an e-mail from [Francisco] Lomelí inform-ing me of Juan Bruce Novoa’s death. Saddened in and for many ways: a friend, a scholar, a willing or-ganizer who promoted Chicano Literature in this country, in Europe, principally, Germany and Spain, as well as in Mexico and Latin America.Envied by some people in the fi eld, JBN’s contri-butions cannot be denied; his extensive vita is proof enough. We’ll miss his clear-eyed view of this American literature: his opinions were consistently backed by proof which proved his sound judgment in liter-ary criticism.All through the day, I’ve been fortunate to receive copies of letters regarding Juan, his manner, his scholarship, his helpful attitude and contributions to undergraduate, gradu-ate students, and professors alike from here and abroad. A great loss, yes, but his presence and productivity will be felt for many years to come and deservedly so.Among Bruce-Novoa’s ac-complishments, his recruit-ing efforts during his six years at Yale produced any number of future Chicano scholars. As time-taking as this was, his scholar-ship in Chicano as well as in Mexican literature continued unabated. His fi rst love, however, was Chicano literature and his stay during the dif-fi cult, and often, violent times, at Colorado University (Boulder) gave him the historical perspective of the Chicano movement in its early stages. Not too many of the younger scholars know that he initiated the fi rst Chicano conference in Spain at Barcelona and Torredembarra; conference which have now have taken place in Granada, Málaga, Sevilla, Vitoria, Alcalá Henares, Alicante, and this year, at León University. As usual, however, he went on to other European academic circles, Germany for one and the Netherlands, for another. Little, too, may be known of his presence and attendance at Guadalajara’s Feria del Libro. As brief as his stay was at Trinity University in San Antonio, he organized a conference on the history of La Prensa, that great Spanish-language newspaper in San Antonio. In brief, a cursory look at his vita reveals an impressive life of scholarship and the good-will he established for Chicano Literature. Despite our long professional relationship, I was unaware of the severity of his illness, and this was in keeping with his character: not wanting to burden anyone with his personal problems.Three friends have died in the past six months: Angela de Hoyos, Luis Leal, and now, JBN. nÂ uNoS RECuERDoSContinued on page 7Photo by Harry Gamboa, Jr. 2001.www.naccs.org 5Tejas focoThe meetings of the Tejas Foco in Seattle were produc-tive and exciting.

Similarly, in October 2008, the NACCS Joto Caucus held its second an-nual conference at Cal State University, Los Angeles where it cultivated sacred space making, where queer scholarship, activism, and performance was discussed and shared. This year’s conference will bring together queer scholars, activists, artists, students, and members of the community to continue to transform normative spaces to celebrate and honor the legacy of survival, resilience, and resistance among our queer communities. We seek to (re) connect with one another in order to challenge ourselves in our academic, political and personal boundaries and learn cross-generationally through our queer scholarship, activism, and performance. We seek to understand the survival/revival of queer people and queer knowledges across generations and locations. In doing so, we continue to imagine and (re)create a queer homeland. While this conference is being organized predominately by Chican@ jotería, we welcome participation from all queer communities resisting to create spaces of equality, equity, safety, inclusiveness, and empowerment regardless of ethnic background, gender orientation, or nationality.ToPiCS—In the spirit of the above mentioned objective we invite proposals and/or papers from undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, community members, activists, and artists/ performers. Rather than fostering a purely academic space, this conference encourages interactive workshops, presentations, and dialogues that encourage self-empowerment among participants. The conference will provide a forum for scholarship, activism, and performance that contributes to and informs (directly and indirectly) Jotería, all of our queer Chicana/o and Latina/o communities. We strongly encourage participation from community organizations and transgender people who would like to present their work as we strive to engage in authentic dialogue between/through activism, performance, and scholarship. Themes or topics may include, but are not limited to the following: Art Interventions; Immigration/Migration; HIV/AIDS; Education; Identity; Mental Health; Spirituality; Indigenisma & Indigenismo; Public Health; Queer Youth; Race, Class, & Gender; Literature; Safe Sex Practices; Community Outreach;Transnationalism; Feminism; Queer Communities; Herstory/History; Transgender rights; Queerstory; FilmHuman/Queer/Women’s Rights; Law; LGTBQI Studies; Postcolonial Studies; Globalization Studies; Mentorship; Violence Intervention & Resistance; Ethnic Studies; Women’s StudiesPRESENTATioN foRMAT—Proposals and papers are currently being accepted for:Interactive workshops, Roundtables, Academic paper presentations/panels, and Undergraduate student plenary (limited to undergraduate students only)Please note that all submissions will be carefully assessed by a team of reviewers.

As president, I will bring ev-erything I’ve got to helping Northern carry out its new mission as a comprehensive higher education institution that is deeply engaged with the communities it serves.\"Barceló began her career as an educator, administrator, and diversity advocate at the University of Iowa, where she received her Ph.D. in higher education administra-tion. She first came to the University of Minnesota in 1996 as the Associate Vice President for Multicultural Affairs. In 2001, she left for a position at the University of Washington as Vice President and Vice Provost for Minority Affairs and Diversity. In 2006, she was invited back to Minnesota, where, as vice president and vice provost, she continued her work as an educator, advocate, and spokesperson for equity and diversity in higher education.By the time you read this newsletter, Barceló will already be overseeing the col-lege. NACCS congratulates her and wishes her well in her new position. n(Rusty Barceló begins...) continued from page 1Karin had an impeccable reputation as an experienced librarian of great vision and superb interpersonal skills. Year after year Karin was one of those individuals who always found the time to volunteer, participate, and coordinate book fairs, scholarship fundraisers, and other events in pursuit of her commitment to the com-munity. Many other community organiza-tions benefited from her organizational and leadership skills. Over and over she is remembered as that woman who came in and organized and got things done, while always smiling and keeping a positive attitude.Karin Duran was a role model and mentor. She was one of the first, if not the first, Latina in the United States to receive a doctoral degree in Library and Information Science. She was often that person who introduced many of us into the profession as Ron Rodriguez, from California State Fullerton notes and as Susan Luevano, from California State Long Beach notes part of the greeting committee to new librarian’s into the California State system.While we were visiting Karin one of her students in Chicano literature dropped by and narrated a familiar story of how Karin had guided him through thru a gradu-ate program. Karin was known to spend countless hours reading and editing gradu-ate students’ theses and dissertations. She made a difference in the lives of many stu-dents who would not have completed their studies without her guidance and support.Some terms used by her colleagues to describe Karin are grounded, a very calm-ing influence, beautiful, a light, genuine in her commitment, loving, caring, uncondi-tional altruism, and genuine politeness.While her passing has been painful to many of us we can celebrate by knowing that Karin’s contributions live on through those she touched. As Yreina Cervantez, her Northridge colleague said \"Let us honor Karin by following her example in continuing to treat each other the way that she did: con cariño y respeto.\" Karin Durán: ¡Presente!

The comments appeared in response to an article announcing the confer-ence and 2 weeks later in another article written by Conciencia Femenil in response to the hate speech/violence. The homophobic slandering attacks intensified and eventually escalated into remarks that referenced an appropriation of an Aztec calling for the murder of gays and lesbians with explicit instructions as to how to administer the killings.Whereas, Chicanas suffer high rates of gender-based violence within our communities and Les-bian, Joto, Bisexual and Transgender Chican@s suffer homophobic/anti-gay and transphobic hate violence in our communities.Whereas, misogyny and homophobia are ram-pant in many academic institutions and Chican@ Studies Departments.Whereas, Chican@ Feminist, Lesbian, Queer, Jota, and Trans academic research, community organizing and curricula provide the possibility for education, intervention and prevention of violence.Whereas, Conciencia Femenil’s Chicana Feminisms Conference at CSU Long Beach in honor of Las Hijas de Cuauhtemoc provided an important space to address the “chronic erasure” of marginalized Chicanas and Queer Chican@s Whereas, Women and Queer Chican@s have historically faced threats and intimidation for attempts to organize against violence.Whereas, Conference organizers and speakers, including Cherrie Moraga and Alma Lopez faced the threat of intimidation, homophobic and sexist hate violence.Whereas, appropriations of indigenous culture have been used to promote violence against Chicanas, Queer, and Trans Chican@s.Therefore Be it Resolved that NACCS exhorts all Chican@ Studies Departments/Programs to in-vestigate and intervene in anti-gay and misogy-nous climates in their Departments and to make any changes necessary to Department title, cur-ricula, and personnel in order to promote justice and representation for marginalized members of our communities including undocumented, Chicanas, Queer, and Trans Chican@s.Be it Further Resolved That NACCS exhorts President F. King Alexander and CSU Long Beach Chicano/a Studies Department to inves-tigate, intervene and respond to hostile anti-gay and misogynist hate speech/violence at CSU Long Beach.Be it Further Resolved that NACCS deplores the appropriation of indigenous culture to promote violence against Chicanas, Queer and Trans Chican@s.Be it Further Resolved that NACCS affirms and commends Conciencia Femenil’s feminist organizing efforts and promotes organizing that empowers marginalized members of our com-munities.Be it Further Resolved that NACCS recognizes Cherrie Moraga, a 2001 NACCS Scholar Recipi-ent, and Alma Lopez’s scholarly and creative contributions as indisputably valuable to the field of Chicana and Chicano Studies and to the advancement of Chicanas and Queer Chican@s.

Be it further resolved that NACCS board will write a letter of support for the department of Women’s Studies to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas president (neal.smatresk@unlv.edu); the provost (michael.bowers@unlv.edu), the dean of the College of Liberal Arts (chris.hugins@unlv.edu) and department chair (lois.helmbold@unlv.edu). NACCS asks the univer-sity to retain its Women’s Studies Department and support its perseverance, continuation and growth.K-12 Caucus: Support for TUSD Mexican American Raza Studies ProgramBe it resolved that NACCS supports the existence of efforts of the TUSD Mexican American Raza Studies Program to continue to positively impact students and communitiesBe it resolved that NACCS will submit two sepa-rate communications; one congratulating TUSD Mexican American Raza Studies for their com-mitment to students and communities; and one letter to the Arizona State Legislature admonish-ing their legislative actions that diminish cultural pluralism and community engagement. nJune 201010Rene Nuñez COMPAS Caucus: Addition of Special RNC Panels to 2011 NACCS ConferenceWhereas Rene Nunez practiced socially committed scholarship, like organizing the historical conference that led to the drafting and publishing of the Plan de Santa Barbara, once left academic to organize workers and unions, and, as a college professor, worked in the Chicano Studies program at San Diego State University; Whereas the NACCS organizational by-laws extend to the Rene Nuñez Political Action Caucus (RNC) the role of directing NACCS’s commitment to a socially activist and community oriented scholarship;Whereas the RNC has had continuous success in providing such direction to NACCS through RNC Special Sessions first under the theme of opposition to the alleged War on Terror (2003–2008) and then through a theme of Participatory Democracy (2009–2010); Whereas the RNC has successful organized over 16 panels and workshops, has had one article published in a collection of NACCS selected proceedings guiding NACCS toward a socially activist and community orientated scholarship, and is working on a manuscript for publication featuring selected papers from the Special Sessions; and Whereas the welcoming letter to this year’s NACCS national conference by incoming Chair Devon Pena, in affirming the need to “move beyond discourse to actual mobilization for campaigns against all forms of oppression and exploitation and the structural violence that allows neoliberal capitalism to colonize every single gay, lesbian, transgendered, and straight body on this planet,” concurs with the stated goals of the RNC Special Sessions; Be it resolved that the 2011 NACCS annual meeting in Pasadena reinstate a space for two RNC-organized consecutive Special Sessions on the afternoon of the third day (normally Friday) of the conference.Be it further resolved that these RNC Special Sessions will be a normal component of subsequent NACCS annual conference meetings, which may be withdrawn only in the instance of a critical review of the performance of the RNC in organizing the Special Sessions by a representative body designated by NACCS Administration and voted by the general body at the annual business meeting.Implications: The long term impact of this resolution if implemented would change the structure of the conference and how the conference is organized. The Board felt the membership should have a say on this resolution.Student Caucus: Name ChangeThe NACCS Student Caucus has decided to change its name to “Caucus Estudiantista: Estudiantil Activista”Whereas the membership feels more represented with the new self chosen/created name for our caucus.Whereas a large part of our membership is involved in some form of activism, our reality as student activists goes beyond the classroom and is not reflected on the present name of our caucus. Let it be resolved that our caucus name be changed to “Caucus Estudiantista: Estudantil Activista”Implications: Bylaws. No financial. nSigned into law by Gov. Jan Brewer a little more tha`n a week ago, Arizona’s new immi-gration law has caused nothing less than a firestorm of contro-versy. After months of health care reform dominating the news, the Arizona Legislature, if nothing more, successfully brought immigration back to the front pages.In the fiery debate over the law, we unfortunately have expe-rienced more smoke than light. Critics have denounced the Arizona law as racist, discriminatory, anti-Latino, anti-immigrant and worse. On the other hand, proponents state that the law simply seeks to enforce existing federal immigration law. What both sides fail to acknowledge is that the real problem here is the failure of Congress to pass meaningful immigration reform.From a lawyer’s perspective, several facts are clear. There will be a legal challenge to the Arizona law, and it probably will be suc-cessful. The legal challenge will likely focus on the most contro-versial provision in the Arizona law—the requirement that local police in the state verify the immigration status of any person with whom they have \"lawful contact\" and about whom they have a \"reasonable suspicion\" is in the country in violation of the U.S. immigration laws.Arizona law will likely collide with Constitution—and loseBy Kevin R. Johnson, 2008 NACCS Scholar2010 Resolutions with By-laws and financial implicationsThe following resolutions will be place forth to the NACCS membership to vote. Details for voting will be emailed to members soon.www.naccs.org 11Why does Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 violate the U.S. Constitution? First, the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution declares that federal law \"shall be the supreme Law of the Land.\" Second, unlike many other areas of law, such as criminal law in which the states and the U.S. government may pass their own laws, immigration regulation is exclusively within the power of the national government.Because immigration may have foreign relations impacts that are best addressed by a single central government, the U.S. Supreme Court has emphatically proclaimed that the \"ower to regulate immigration is unquestionably exclusively a federal power.\" Consequently, just like it prohibits the 50 states from having their own foreign policy, the U.S. Constitution bars the states from having their own immigration laws.Through the comprehensive Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress has exercised its power to regulate immigration while the executive branch, primarily through the Department of Homeland Security, enforces the immigration laws.Both proponents and opponents agree that the Arizona law is an aggressive immigration enforcement measure. The problem is that it is a state, not the U.S. government, which is seeking to regulate immigration. By seeking to regulate immigration, the Arizona law plainly intrudes on the federal immigration enforcement scheme and therefore violates the Supremacy Clause.It is not an appropriate legal response to say, as some Arizona legislators and supporters have, that Senate Bill 1070 simply en-forces federal law. It is for the federal government to decide how, when and why to enforce federal immigration law—law over which it has the exclusive authority.The Supreme Court a few years ago rejected a remarkably similar argument in striking down a California law that sought to recover monies from insurance companies for victims of the Holocaust in more aggressive a fashion than the U.S. government; in so doing, the court acknowledged \"he basic fact is that California seeks to use an iron fist where the President has consistently chosen kid gloves.\" Here, it is Arizona that seeks to act with an \"iron fist\" toward immigrants, while, in the eyes of many of the law’s proponents, the president has used \"kid gloves.\"Arizona’s actions may also have foreign policy consequenc-es, which is precisely why immigration is entrusted by the Constitution to the federal government, not to the individual states. Senate Bill 1070 has already provoked an angry response from Mexico’s President Felipe Calderón. Indeed, the Mexican government last week issued a travel advisory warning its citi-zens about the risks of visiting Arizona.The Arizona Legislature would have fared better if it had studied California’s experience with Proposition 187, an initia-tive approved overwhelmingly by the voters in 1994. Among other things, the initiative would have required school officials, state employees and police officers to report to federal authori-ties persons whom they suspected of being undocumented. A federal court struck down Proposition 187—and rightly so—as an unconstitutional intrusion by the Golden State on the federal government’s power to regulate immigration.The Arizona law is constitutionally deficient for precisely the same reasons that Proposition 187 was struck down. True, a lower court, not the U.S. Supreme Court, invalidated the mea-sure and a few lower courts since then have shown a somewhat greater willingness to allow states to pass immigration-related legislation. However, the basic rule of federal supremacy in the realm of immigration remains the same. And the Arizona law unquestionably crosses the line into the federal power over the regulation of immigration.Besides being unlawful, the Arizona law also might well con-stitute poor law-enforcement policy. Like it or not, millions of immigrants—undocumented and lawful—live in towns and cities across the United States. Local police need to enjoy the trust of immigrants to effectively do their jobs. However, immigrants, and some Latino citizens, are less likely to report crimes and cooperate generally with police, if they fear that the officers will arrest them for violating the immigration laws.So, the argument goes, local police should not be involved in immigration enforcement. This common sense reasoning even led some police chiefs in Arizona to oppose the Arizona law. Indeed, many police chiefs, including generations of heads of the notoriously tough Los Angeles Police Department, support a ban on officers inquiring into the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses and suspects.My prediction is that, in the coming weeks before the Arizona law goes into effect, a suit challenging the constitutionality of the law will be filed, a court shortly thereafter will bar the law from being enforced, and Arizona’s pernicious law will never go into effect. President Barack Obama has asked the Department of Justice to look at the lawfulness of the law, and the U.S. government appears to be weighing a possible legal challenge. Alternatively, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Immigration Law Center have announced that they will file suit challenging the law.Importantly, Arizona is not the only state that has gotten im-mersed in the immigration quagmire in recent years. Oklahoma, Georgia, Mississippi and Utah, as well as a number of cities have passed immigration legislation. One reason for the burgeoning number of state and local laws is the growing frustration with the failure of Congress to enact comprehensive immigration reform. Arizona’s immigration law hopefully will serve as a wake-up call to the federal government.Following the lead of Obama, Congress must provide leadership on immigration reform. Congress should act to stop state and local governments from taking the immigration laws into their own hands. Only when immigration reform is enacted will we see an end to foolhardy state and local laws like Arizona Senate Bill 1070.Originally published in the Sacramento Bee, Sunday, May 2, 2010.  Published with permission of author. nJune 201012There were more than twenty paper panel, workshop, and roundtable sessions on the conference theme and two of the plenary sessions also focused on issues of environmental and food justice (the Thematic Plenary and the Chicana Caucus Plenary). Over 400 people attended the conference and many participated in an immigrant rights’ protest march and field trips to Marra Farm and Centro de la Raza, since 1972, the historic center of Chicana/o activism in the Seattle area.Among the conference highlights were the Plenary Addresses by Dr. Diana Bustamante and Rufina Juarez. Juarez, one of the cofounders of the South Central Farmers Feeding Families and an activist in La Red Indigena Xicana, opened the pro-ceedings with a brilliant lecture on the necessary connection between environmental and food justice. She inspired the audience with a talk that featured analysis of race, class, and gender in the urban agriculture movement. Juarez posed a question addressed by others at the conference: \"Proponents of human rights talk all the time about the horrors of conflict diamonds but what about the horrors of conflict food?\"Dr. Bustamante, the founder and executive director of Las Colonias Development Council, delivered the second plenary address. Her focus was on the progress of the environmental justice movement in New Mexico. The legal cases and organiz-ing work led by the Council have resulted in significant changes to the manner New Mexico state agencies deal with environ-mental racism. Her plenary address inspired the audience with a reminder that the principal barrier to change is the lack of organization and self-mobilization by our own communities.The Chicana Plenary was also an inspiring event and the packed audience was treated to an amazing set of addresses and discussions on the theme of environmental justice, race, class, and gender. The three plenary speakers included Susana Almanza, Co-Director of PODER (People Organized in Defense of Earth and her Resources), Sara Garcia, an environmental educator from Santa Clara University, and Gloria A. Ramirez, editor of La Voz de Esperanza. Dr. Mary Pardo (CSU Northridge) was the moderator. Highlights of the session included Almanza’s historical overview of the envi-ronmental justice movement that, she noted, has always been led by women on the frontlines of the struggle against politi-cal ecological oppression. Prof. Garcia’s presentation focused on the importance of environmental education and the need for the integration of ecological perspectives into Chicana/o Studies. Ramirez recounted the environmental justice strug-gles of the barrio communities of San Antonio, pointing to the convergence of anti-poverty, political empowerment, and environmental protection movements as an example of the power of ecological issues as a \"bridge\" across identity-based differences that have often divided the Chicana/o struggle into discrete but largely unconnected struggles.More than fifty conference participants joined local activists for a protest at a local park focused on immigrants’ rights. Others joined Teresa Mares, a University of Washington grad-uate student, for a visit to Marra Farm, one of the country’s largest urban farms that is known for its ethnic diversity.Panels featured presentations on a wide range of topics that have seldom, if ever, been addressed at previous NACCS gatherings: food justice and sovereignty, slow, local, and deep food, urban agriculture, environmental justice and risk science, acequia water law, and ethnoecology or traditional environmental knowledge (TEK) were among the topics ad-dressed by scholars and activists. Several panels focused on Chicana/o student activism and the efforts to establish more urban agriculture projects tied to the colleges and universities. Another important set of panels focused on current immigra-tion issues and policies.One panel featured Sean Arce and his colleagues from the Tucson Unified School District’s exemplary Mexican American Studies Program, which has been targeted for elimination under Arizona’s new HB2281. These presenta-tions inspired many members to commit to work to overturn and resist the draconian and unconstitutional laws passed some three weeks after the end of the conference (see Chair’s report on Arizona activities below).The theme of the 2010 conference was focused on environ-mental justice but activism and activist scholarship were also central themes addressed in numerous panel, workshop, and roundtable sessions. Calls for a return to the legacy of NACCS as a collective for the development of social action or partici-patory action research (PAR) filled the sessions with analyses and presentations outlining strategies that research scholars and activists are using to challenge injustice in localities across the country. If the conference papers are any indication, then NACCS is indeed in the midst of a period witnessing the revi-talization of activist and social justice oriented research projects. The lesson offered seem to be: Si se puede, but only if you orga-nize to create autonomous institutions of collective action.In my role as the conference lead organizer and Chair-Elect, colleagues and students approached me for conversations about the future direction of the organization over the four days of the proceedings. As a result of these conversations, NACCS is initiating several projects including assisting with the civil society organizations to defeat Arizona’s anti-immigrant and anti-ethnic studies laws. As 2010–11 Chair, I am also initiating a \"NACCS 2.0\" project that will bring our work out of the academic ivory tower and back into the com-munities where our knowledge production is most urgently needed. Please look for more information on NACCS 2.0 in the next newsletter and at the NACCS homepage. n(Post-Conference Report: Seattle...) continued from page 5upcoming Events & Deadlines2011 NACCS Scholar Submission: October 2Frederick A Cervantes Student Premio: October 9Presentation Proposal Submission: October 15Book Award: October 22Student BECA: October 22See naccs.org for details.www.naccs.org 13At the meeting, we discussed the both the national and Tejas book award. Arturo Madrid, of Trinity University, donated $500 dollars for three years to both awards. He asked that Trinity be acknowledged.There was discussion about the possibil-ity of recognizing past scholars and past chairs at the national meeting to show the organization’s continued appreciation. For people who have passed away, it was submitted that someone could stand and say \"presente\" in remembrance.The membership in attendance also decid-ed to nominate that the national meeting of NACCS be held in San Antonio, TX in 2012. It was hoped that this meeting would be a collaborative effort between the many universities in the city. Another goal for the national meeting would be to increase the presence of the literary arts by get-ting people to the cultural centers in San Antonio, such as the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, the Museo Alameda, etc.We discussed nominating a person from our Foco for the NACCS scholar.Our discussion then moved towards mat-ters that affected the Tejas foco in particu-lar. It was suggested that we create awards for the best article, dissertation, and work of fiction on Tejanas/os. At the 2011 conference in McAllen, volunteers will try to record oral histories of many Chicanas stories and their experiences with NACCS.Lastly, we were incredibly pleased to hear that long time NACCS member John Chávez won the World History Association’s Book Prize for 2010 for his book Beyond Nations: Evolving Homelands in the North Atlantic World, 1400–2000 (Oxford University Press, 2009)—a book in which Chávez uses models developed by Chicana/o historians, such as internal colonialism, to put changes in the experi-ences of ethnic minorities in the Atlantic world in perspective. nas Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature and Social Justice (with special-izations in American Indian and Latina/o Literatures) at the University of Dayton. I very much look forward to collaborating with colleagues in the region and in the larger NACCS community.The Midwest Foco meeting at the 2010 NACCS conference was rich with ideas for collaboration. We discussed meet-ing in the fall but have not yet secured a date or venue (please contact me if you are interested in attending). Other am-bitions include proposing a regionally specific panel for next year’s conference, evaluating the different roles our Foco can serve for faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates, advocating for NACCS attention to contemporary social and political issues impacting Chicanas/os, and identifying ways we can put our academic resources to the service of local community members.After returning from the conference I invited feedback from Midwest Foco members, through our listserv, regarding the future direction of our Foco. Some of the suggestions include strengthening the Great Lakes and mujer presence at NACCS, and maintaining more regular contact between Foco members.I invite Midwest Foco members to continue to contact me with sugges-tions, to use our listserv regularly (to circulate information to Foco members, raise questions, etc.), and to volunteer to spearhead any of the efforts outlined above (or ideas not yet logged here). n(Midwest Foco) continued from page 5(Tejas Foco) continued from page 52) Followed up on conference call and mid-year meeting activities, including: Finalized Frequently Asked Question for Foco and Caucus Financial Processes, in conjunction with Daniel Perez and Julia Curry Rodriguez. Sent electronic copy of FAQs to all Foco and Caucus representatives, and provided hard copies for distribution at the con-ference. Technical Director will upload the FAQs asap. Worked with Technical Director and Executive Director to create an online donations link that allows individuals to make electronic donations to NACCS, independent of the registration and membership process. The link must be provided via email, and is otherwise not available. Will assist with developing a stand-alone link for donations when web site undergoes major re-design.  Worked with Executive Director and Technical Director to develop Individual Foco and Caucus Membership Reports, the Foco and Caucus Revenue Report, and the gen-eral Membership Report. Sent elec-tronic copies of the reports to Foco and Caucus representatives, and provided hard copies for them at the conference.Served on Immigrant Student Beca schol-arship committee, including review of no-tification letters and payment processes. Provided electronic distribution list of previous exhibitors to Technical Director. Held preliminary and informal dis-cussions with Dr. Federico Subervi, Director of the Latino Media Studies Center at Texas State University, regard-ing the possibility of institutionalizing a yearlong internship for a journal-ism student to assist with the NACCS newsletters. Will work with previous newsletter editors to develop a time-line and summary of tasks that could potentially be handled by an intern to determine whether an internship would be feasible. The internship could be held as a competition, and could potentially reduce the time and cost involved in producing the quarterly newsletter.  Fund-raising: began preliminary analy-sis of historical donation patterns, and developed a preliminary draft of a fund-raising letter targeting previous NACCS scholars and board members. Note: I developed a draft of this letter in 2007 or 2008, but did not finalize or distribute. n(Treasurer) continued from page 5June 201014ExpensesProgram 3,471.00 AV 13,155.07 ALS Interpreter 2,186.00 Labor Kathy 500.00 Board Food 528.00 M b B kMember Breaks 1,088.00 Staff/Volunteer/Board Lunches 1,663.75 Welcome Reception 2,400.00 Exhibitor Breaks 855 .00Staff Break 717.00 Grad Reception 1,430.00 Joteria Receptionp 1,030.00, Luncheon 17,714.00 Closing reception 3,150.00 Student Presenter Lodging 2,055.00 Travel and Lodging Staff 1,061.00 Registration Supplies 200 .00Registration Staff Compensation 650.00 Pre_conference Newsletter 520.00 Cervantes Award 700.00 Award Materials 468.69 Lodging Guests 1644.00 Guest Travel 1269.30 Hotel Staff Gratuities 200.00 Tour ExpensesTour Expenses 70.64 Speaker Fees 550.00 Entertainment fees_Sin Fronteras 1000.00 $60,276.45 incomePre_Registration: 290 37,525.00 On_Site Registration 9725.00 Exhibitors 6,775.00 Department Sponsorships 0.00 Program Ads 1,250.00 Donation Acequia Institute 5,500.00 Donations_Joteria 100.00 Donation_UW 1,000.00 61,875.00 T_shirts 274.00 Bags 298.00 DeCals 21.00 Pins 130.00Proceedings 62.00PNW Foco Fundraising 0.00 Luncheon Tix 690.00 Room & FB Rebates 2018.61 3,493.61 TOTAL 65,368.61 Cost Per Person all income: $177.97Percentage of conference paid by REG fees: 80Total Registrants: 368Conference paid by total reg fees: 368$128.40Percentage of conference paid by Pre-reg fees: 64Conference Expenses $ 60,276.45Conference Income $ 65,368.61Difference $ 5,092.16Expenses IncomeMay 24, 2010Â 2010 CoNfERENCE ExPENSES AND iNCoMEwww.naccs.org 15Funds may be used for any official Caucus or Foco activity approved by the member-ship.  To request funds please fill out a check requisition form (available in the member section of the website) and provide a letter explaining the expense and member approval. Contact the treasurer at ana@naccs.org with any questions.Each year Focos and Caucuses accrue non-revolving funds from membership dues.  Revenue is based on the previous year’s membership.  Therefore, for 2010 activities, Focos and Caucuses may use the revenue from 2009 memberships.  Revenue is maintained in the NACCS accounts identified according to member specifica-tions and category.  Caucuses receive the actual dues at 5 and 10 dollars based on members who pay Caucus dues.  Focos accrue 2 and 5 dollar rebates based on the category of membership. If groups do not use their funds by the end of the calendar year the money reverts to the NACCS general account and is used to defray costs of conference expenses such as receptions, student lodging fellowships, coffee breaks, and other expenses that benefit the entire membership during the conference. n(Foco and Caucus Revenue) continued from page 5FOCOS($2/member) ($5/member)Total Revenue for 2011# Members / $ Amount# Members / $ AmountColorado 0 0 5 25 25East Coast 2 4 14 70 74Mexico 2 4 3 15 19Midwest 16 32 30 150 182Northern California 45 90 24 120 210Southern California 51 102 48 240 342Tejas 16 32 35 175 207Pacific Northwest 7 14 22 110 124Rocky Mountain 12 24 18 90 114Uncertain (25)CAUCUSESLow Income & Student Members ($5/member)Non-Student Members ($10/member)Total Revenue for 2011# Members / $ Amount# Members / $ AmountLBTM 3 15 7 70 85COMPAS 6 30 9 90 120Indigenous 12 60 8 80 140Chicana 22 110 49 490 600Joto 12 60 5 50 110K-12 0 0 6 60 60Graduate 53 265 0 0 265Community 5 25 11 110 135Student 10 50 50has always been on the fore in Chicano communities. From the establishment of bilingual education to the walkouts of the late 60’s to the emergence of Chicano Studies programs at colleges and universities, education, in a more formal sense, has held great import for our communities.However, there are other sites where education occurs that may initially appear invisible. When children of immigrant parents marched in 2006 there was a site of education. When professors and policy analysts question and critically speak to racist and discriminatory policies and laws there is a site of education. When we denounce racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression through film, poetry, literature, art, and other media, we have a site of edu-cation. In each of these instances and others we educate and move toward social justice.For the 38th NACCS conference we call for submissions on education from a broad perspective, not just the four walls of a school, college, or university classroom. Let us examine how we, the membership of NACCS, both academics and activ-ists, are educators who promote educative acts that move us toward social justice.(Sites of Education....) continued from page 2(Foco and Caucus Revenue) continued from page 5Contact your NACCS BoardChair: Devon Peña, devon@naccs.orgChair Elect: Jaime Garcia, jaime@naccs.orgPast Chair: Nohemy Solorzano-Thompson, nohemy@naccs.orgTreasurer: Ana Juarez, ana@naccs.orgSecretary: Cynthia Duarte, cynthia@naccs.orgAt Large Reps: Daniel Enrique Perez, dep@naccs.org, Karleen Pendleton Jimenez, karleen@naccs.org, Michelle Tellez, michelle@naccs.orgExecutive Director: Julia Curry Rodriguez, julia@naccs.orgMembership/General Questions: naccs@naccs.orgNew Officers AnnouncedJaime H.

The Texas Democratic Party has also been circulating the statement to its members. The statement earned NACCS mention as one of the top ten organizations cited by the National Institute for Latino Politics (NiLP) as a leading force against these new attacks on immigrants and communities of color.While position statements on significant and timely public policy issues are important tools to educate and organize, as NACCS Chair I decided more had to be done. I arranged for a trip to Arizona (June 19–22) to organize a press conference to publicize the statement, and to initiate contacts and meetings with local organizations resisting these laws and to lay the groundwork for a \"NACCS Human Rights Watch\" project to monitor and report on official and police misconduct tied to the two new statutes. NACCS obviously views both as uncon-stitutional and racially discriminatory laws. NACCS has thus joined numerous other organizations in an amicus (friend of the court) brief submitted by the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) and MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund).The Arizona trip involved productive meetings with Sean Arce (Director) and staff at the Mexican American Studies Program in Tucson, Tonatierra organizers, and other local  and regional organizations including the \"Alto Arizona\" group(a coalition leading the boycott campaign), and re-searchers tracking right-wing extremists in Arizona.The press conference was held on June 19 in front of the State Capitol building in Phoenix. Originally conceived as a joint effort of NACCS, MALCS (Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambios Social), and La Red Indigena Xicana, the group eventually expanded to include a consortium of professional scholarly and academic organizations that joined NACCS in taking a strong position against SB1070 and HB2281.The press conference involved the participation of ten aca-demic and professional scholarly organizations, includ-ing NACCS and the following organizations: American Studies Association (ASA), Chicano/Latino Faculty and Staff Association-ASU (CLFSA), Justice Studies Association (JSA),Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social (MALCS), Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA), Peace and Justice Studies Association (PJSA), Psychologists for Social Responsibility (PsySR), Society for the Study of Social Problems (SSSP), and Sociologists Without Borders (Sociologos Sin Fronteras) (SSF). While local Fox and ABC affiliates covered the press conference, the news pro-grams did not carry the story on any of the evening newscasts. The list of organizations joining the consortium against SB1070 and HB2281 has grown and now includes more than 145 affiliates with more than 15,000 members. For more information, visit: http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2010/05/18–1. At the meetings with Mr. Arce in Tucson, we focused dis-cussions on the background events leading to the passage of HB2281. We reviewed the spurious charges made by the principal architect and proponent of the law, Tom Horne (R), the Arizona Superintendent of Public Schools. Horne is a beneficiary of the legal counsel provided by the xenophobic Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), itself funded by the Pioneer Fund, a white supremacist organiza-tion that promotes \"practical eugenics\" and strict \"national origin immigration quotas\" in order to maintain the demo-graphic (white, Anglo-Saxon) purity of the USA. The absurd charges include allegations that ethnic studies \"promotes racial resentment,\" that it \"calls for the overthrow of the American government,\" and that it favors and targets particu-lar ethnic groups. It was agreed that NACCS would join in the lawsuit for repeal of this statute by providing empirical data, course materials, and expert witness testimony to critique these charges and evaluate the proponents’ assessment of the effectiveness of ethnic studies. We are preparing an amicus brief for the forthcoming litigation.Brief meetings with Tonatierra and Alto Arizona organiz-ers followed the session with Mr. Arce. The meeting with Tonatierra organizer, Sylvia Herrera, focused on how to collaborate to implement a plan NACCS is developing for an Arizona \"Human Rights Watch.\" This campaign seeks to monitor elected officials and police for misconduct in the enforcement of SB1070. Later, at an educational gathering downtown with the Alto Arizona, I met with several organiz-ers that included a coordinator that is bringing some of the original African American civil rights activists from the heroic 1960s Mississippi \"Freedom Riders\" campaign. Busloads of protestors and activists, from all ethnic and racial back-grounds, are arriving from all over the country in Arizona for sustained protests and other direct actions.The trip ended after a visit with a Native American \"affinity group\" gathered outside the Davis-Monahan Border Patrol Station on Golf Link Road in south Tucson. The Native activists, joined by youth anarchists, were there to support an amazing event: Inside the Border Patrol Station was a group of nine Chicana/o and Native American activists that chained themselves to building support columns in an act of nonviolent civil disobedience. This protest action was both unprecedented and deeply profound. Never in the history of the Border Patrol has a group of citizens occupied an ICE station and effectively shut it down, in this case for more than 18 hours. Yet, the protest action was subject to a total media blackout and the news networks failed to cover this historic event. Many activists promised that the entire summer would see direct actions of this type across the entire border region.NACCS will continue to play an active role in the legal and political mobilization against SB1070 and HB2281. As NACCS Chair, I am returning to Arizona in July and August for additional work sessions with local organizers and activ-ists. Look for periodic updates and more information on the NACCS Facebook page.I would like to thank Manuel de Jesus Hernandez, Michelle Tellez, Luis Fernandez, Randall Amster, and Gloria Cuadraz for making my visit easier and more productive. n(NACCS at the heart of campaign...) continued from page 1www.naccs.org 17Seeing people run to the nearest television set; the sight of our students with their faces painted and wearing Mexico soccer shirts; and the Zocalo Plaza filled with people watching the Mexico vs. Germany game on the two large sets is engrained in my mind forever. The sites and sounds wove into my essence along with the magnificent feel of being in the centro historio where so much of our cultural and geopolitical roots lie. I have a fond memories of that NACCS and it is one reason I love watch-ing the World Cup. The sounds take me back to the NACCS of Cuahutémoc Cárdenas (then D.F. Mayor), Renato Rosaldo and Salvador del Pino(NACCS Scholars), and so much more!Although this month started with much cheer and fanfare, it’s been a month of great sadness to the NACCS world, beginning with the loss of Karin Duran, and then Juan Bruce-Novoa, and Carlos Monsivais. As a librarian I often travel to Guadalajara to the Feria Internacional del Libro. The Book Festival provided me many opportunities of attending seminars with prominent Mexican historians, philosophers and writers—I had the op-portunity to attend sessions offered by Monsivais on several occasions. He was a regular at the Festival and it gave me the privilege of being in a quasi-small setting to see and hear a great man and thinker whose imprint on Chicana/o Studies is significant. Every time I heard him, I considered myself fortu-nate. I was saddened by his death, but I am happy that I got to see him and to understand his influence on Chicana/o thinkers. Oddly, the second person is also tied to FIL. I remember Juan Bruce-Novoa from one of my earliest conferences at NACCS, as an iconic man who wore a black fedora, a black cape with red lining, and walked with a cane. I was an undergraduate. I never had him as a teacher but I knew his name from my Chicano Studies readings and knew he was important to the field. A few years ago, while at the Guadalajara Book Fair, I attended a series of seminars on Chicana/o literature at which I was introduced to Dr. Bruce along with Dr. Rolando Hinojosa-Smith. I got invited to join them for dinner and sat next to Bruce-Novoa. We spent much of the conversation talking about NACCS. He was critical of the organization, but he stat-ed that he supported the changes that were being introduced. Not sure why, but when the dinner finished and we were departing, I started to cry. I felt like a student getting to meet a Chicano idol. I couldn’t explain it but I just cried. And so I cried again but this time I know why. Of all these great people, Karin Duran, was the only one I believe I never met. Although we shared a profession, and I know her contribution to Chicana and Chicano Studies library developments, I never physically met her. I know that we were probably physically present in the same room at many a NACCS or REFORMA conference, and can’t explain how we never met. I know, however, that she will be sorely missed. Karin is part of an important cohort of Chicano librarians that helped build Chicano Studies in our academic libraries, spending most of her career in Northridge. You have to credit her work there as important in contributing to a strong Chicano Studies Department. Karin was a Chicano Studies ally in the Library, the establishment of resources to support student research was an advantage. She leaves a legacy in CSUN and to all future Chicana/o librarians. As for NACCS, she was an active member renewing her membership every year and attending the conferences. Que descanzen en Paz.This is the post-conference newsletter and I am taking the lib-erty of telling you about my own feelings about what NACCS has given me, and about the heartfelt joy and loss I feel when-ever I must reminisce about how fortunate I am to be part of this organization. I have grown up in NACCS, and I value the opportunities it gives me to be mentored by my own people. n(From the Editor) continued from page 2NACCS-CC in Mexico 1998 with D.F. Mayor C. Cardenas.",
