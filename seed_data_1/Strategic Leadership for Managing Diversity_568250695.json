As a capstone project, it is intended for educational purposes to allow the doctoral candidate to demonstrate the ability to conduct and present meaningful doctoral-level research. The DRP is limited to a Single Case Study design focusing on a leadership problem found in the literature within a single organization. The DRP is not intended for publication, and the results are not intended to be relatable or generalizable to a larger population. Because of these limitations, the DRP is not considered to be research and is excluded from the review and approval of the Liberty University Institutional Review Board (IRB) under 45 CFR 46.102(l). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY  ii Abstract The changing workforce in organizations worldwide, including those in Africa, makes managing diversity a critical issue that must be a part of any organizational business strategy. This qualitative case study explored the success and failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity in organizations in the West African region and the adverse effects globalization, and ethnocentrism might have in managing diversity in the workplace. This study took place in Africa, and 15 participants from this West African organization participated in interviews and surveys. The data collection yielded themes the participants in the study thought could improve leaders' capabilities in managing a diverse workforce. A thematic analysis of the interviews, survey respondents' data, and organizational documents identified challenges and opportunities to achieve diverse workforce organizational goals. Among these challenges is implementing policies to advance an organization's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts to address the possible failure to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity within the Western African technology industry, resulting in decreased workers’ job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities in senior leadership positions. This research paradigm used a constructive and transformative framework to study the named organization in which diversity in the workplace has become a reality because of the global business environment. The data coding and analysis used NVivo, and the survey questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS descriptive statistical analysis capabilities.

Studies found that exemplary leadership from those at the top of the hierarchy with inspirational motivation can compensate for the lack of inclusive group attitudes to openness with the language of diversity to create a working environment where employees from diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures can strive for organizations' objectives.  The findings from this study showed that to address the specific problem of a lack of a leadership strategy, leaders must have cultural competencies that enable them to know members of their diverse workforce. Leaders must walk the talk on diversity, and their moral values must align with their company's values to help create good relationships between coworkers. The findings also showed managers must draw on their cultural competencies to lead their diverse workforce effectively. According to participants in this study, cultural competency is necessary because it allows leaders to know about their workers' cultural differences, guiding them to understand diversity better. Qualitative researchers consist of communities of individuals who attempt to implement interpretive approaches that can help them make sense of the world by employing constructivist, critical theory, feminist, and critical race theories as models of interpretation of the events of daily life (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). When conducting their research, these researchers use strategies or methods such as case studies, ethnography, and grounded theory. They wrestle with STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 2 positivism, post-positivism, post-modernism, constructivism, and pragmatism paradigms posit Denzin and Lincoln. What the researchers bring to their inquiry, such as personal history, views of themselves and others, ethical and political issues, and philosophical assumptions that provide the direction of the study, are applied through the use of paradigms and theories as an interpretive framework (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Along the same line, Denzin and Lincoln (2018) define a research paradigm as the set of beliefs, principles, and human constructions of a researcher's worldview encompassing ethics, epistemology, ontology, and methodology. According to Denzin and Lincoln, every epistemology implies an ethical, moral stance toward the world, and ontology deals with questions about the nature of reality and the nature of human beings; epistemology is concerned with gaining knowledge about the world. This case study used a constructivist framework with an orientation to reconstruct the social world to benefit all beings; constructivists connect actions to building arguments while encouraging experimentation, argue Denzin and Lincoln. Background of the Problem Personal practical experience in the workplace and highlights from the research literature influenced the researcher's perceptions and confirmed the lack of a leadership strategy for managing diversity (LSMD) in organizations. The root cause of the lack of an LSMD can be attributed to several factors, including social identity, organizational context, perceptual differences, and position power. Studies reveal that enhancing the representation of more diverse employees is one way of embracing diversity, but it is not enough; to fully tap into the intended outcomes of diversity, organizations need to focus also on inclusion (Mor Barak et al., 2016; Shore et al., 2018). Diversity and inclusion are two sides of the same coin; they are different but STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 3 complement each other. As the Vernā Myers Company puts it, diversity is invited to the party, and inclusion is asked to dance (Sherbin & Rashid, 2017). Additionally, another root cause of this observable fact embodied in diversity is that people have different perceptions that are related to their position, status, or power, and those who are in control are less aware of how issues associated with LSMD affect members with lower status (Yang, 2014; Yang & Li, 2017, 2018). Thus, the necessity to establish a leadership that promotes diversity and implements practices that empower others. Approaches for managing diversity in the workplace mainly concentrate on the positive organizational outcomes from a diverse workforce rather than individual well-being. Managing diversity as a process involves ensuring every unit of the corporate hierarchy is diversified, the work environment is free from hostilities, and the harassment that often arises in a highly diverse workforce, therefore fostering employee well-being, Riccucci (2018). Researchers claim that the most essential to implementing a successful diversity program is a commitment from top leadership. In organizations with diverse demographics, inclusive leadership is required to support the participation of various members; leadership is not something you do to people; it is something you do with people (Ashikali et al., 2020; Blanchard & Broadwell, 2018).  Inclusive leadership involves all members of an organization to promote understanding of the benefits a diverse workforce contributes to organizational performance. Janese Murray at Exelon Corp says that leaders are looking for new ways to conduct themselves in a diverse workplace by listening to white men, women, and minorities air their concerns if they are concerned about missing out on career development or other opportunities, argues Simons (2017). On the flip side, the prominent corporate structure has hindered the inclusiveness of new ideas because many leaders do not listen to any opinions or ideas of employees or management from the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 4 bottom of the ladder, posits Kothe (2017). Moreover, Randel et al. (2018) found that inclusive leadership behaviors facilitate team members' belongingness while maintaining uniqueness within groups and contributing to a positive organizational outcome.  Jin et al. (2017) found a direct effect of inclusive leadership on individual-level perceptions of workgroup effectiveness and individual-level leadership behaviors. Decision-makers in organizations must be culturally competent to gain the ability to know others, their culture, beliefs,  and ideas. In the literature, there are potential solutions related to leadership styles that can help organizations navigate through the murky water of managing a diverse workforce. These leadership styles include servant leadership, transformational leadership, charismatic leadership, inclusive leadership, and others that have proved their efficacy in managing diversity (Adiguzel & Cakir, 2020; Moon, 2016; Randel et al., 2018). Additionally, from the literature, researchers believe that social constructs can help promote diversity in the workplace; these include organizational moral values, human resource (HR) practices to reduce ethnocentrism and nationalism behaviors, promote cultural competencies, and a trustworthy working environment. Problem Statement The general problem to be addressed is the lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity in organizations, resulting in the inability of organizations to make strategic changes to gain a competitive advantage in the era of rapidly shifting demographics. Riccucci (2018) found that the American workforce of today is not that of a decade ago because today, women, people of color, immigrants, baby boomers, and millenniums are working side-by-side. Dajnoki et al. (2017) note that demographic changes in the workplace will challenge leaders to implement strategies to promote diversity and inclusiveness. According to (Sherbin & Rashid, 2017), leaders have recognized that a diverse workforce confers a competitive edge in providing STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 5 customer services. (Choi et al., 2018; Sidhu et al., 2020) observed that the problem of effectively managing diversity in organizations derives from the rarity of women and minorities in leadership positions, and increasing their representation in higher positions leads to improvement and integrity. The specific problem to be addressed is the possible failure to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity within a West African organization, resulting in the potential decrease in workers’ job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities to senior leadership positions. Purpose Statement This qualitative case study aims to understand and explore the success and failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity in an organization in West Africa. The lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity is defined as poor leadership decisions, misunderstanding of the benefits a diverse workforce contributes to organizational performance, and the adverse effects globalization and ethnocentrism might have in managing diversity in the workplace.  Research Questions According to (Robson & McCartan, 2016), research questions help set boundaries, give direction, and focus the researchers' efforts when searching the literature, gathering data, in selecting a study method. They define how successful the project resulted in great answers to the research questions, argues O'Leary (2005). Research questions tend to fall into one of five categories - descriptive, evaluative, narrative, causal, and effects; 'what' questions seek descriptive answers that describe the characteristics of something; 'why' questions seek to explain or understand something; and 'why questions indicate a concern for change, according to (Blaikie, 2007; Knight, 2002). Qualitative research questions are more open-ended and tend to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 6 address 'what' and 'how' questions. The research questions must be linked to the purpose of the study and always be framed in terms of what can be observed or measured, according to Robson and McCartan (2016). Qualitative research questions are open-ended, evolving, and non-directional; they restate the purpose of the study in more specific terms; they are clear and unambiguous, show the purpose of the project, must be answerable, are not trivial, and form a coherent interconnected set according to (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Robson & McCartan, 2016). The subquestions in this study are here to further specify or refine the central question by breaking it into its constituent parts and help inform core questions asked during data collection; in a case study, they help address the elements of the case that the researcher seeks to understand (Creswell & Poth, 2018). RQ1 What approach for managing diversity can be part of strategic planning? RQ1a What strategic role do top executives play in promoting diversity?  RQ1b What would be the effects of integrating diversity in the mission statement? The primary RQ1 question, 'What approach for managing diversity can be part of strategic planning?' is a 'what' open-ended question that seeks to understand the appropriate strategic approaches for managing a diverse workforce by looking at the organizational strategic planning objective. The subquestion RQ1a further specifies the role of top executives and decision-makers and their influence on the central question's inquiry. The subquestion RQ1b further analyzed the topic based on the central question determining the requirements for diversity management as a part of the organizational mission and values statements. RQ2 How do CEOs' moral values contribute to workplace diversity management? RQ2a To what extent do executives' cultural beliefs impact managing diversity? RQ2b What cultural competencies do leaders need for managing diversity? STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 7 The research question RQ2 - 'How do CEOs' moral values contribute to workplace diversity management?' investigated executives' moral values and their impact on diversity management. Researchers show that CEOs' beliefs, moral values, and engagement influence workplace diversity practices in organizations and are crucial (Ng & Sears, 2020). The subquestions RQ2a and RQ2b further investigate how executives' cultural beliefs and cultural competencies can play an essential role in managing diversity in the workplace. According to (Weimer & Zemrani, 2017), cultural competencies are necessary for serving a culturally diverse workforce in contemporary businesses. Together, CEOs’ moral values and cultural competencies build the foundation for implementing diversity management. RQ3 How do global leaders influence, motivate, and empower followers in the workplace? RQ3a What do managers need to empower members of a diverse workforce? RQ3b What are the leadership behaviors necessary for managing diversity? The primary question, RQ3 'How do global leaders influence, motivate, and empower followers in the workplace?' in this study seeks to understand how leadership empowerment can motivate followers, and the subquestion RQ3a and RQ3b inquiry about what skills leaders need to empower members of a diverse workforce. According to Syed et al. (2019), modern organizations face multiculturalism, a system of beliefs and behaviors that recognizes and respects diversity in organizations that empowers all within the organization by contributing to an inclusive cultural environment, argues Rosado (2006). The subquestions mentioned here address leadership behaviors necessary to empower employees in a diverse workforce. RQ4 What consequences do globalization and ethnocentrism have in managing diversity? RQ4a What effect does globalization have on the strategic management of diversity? RQ4b What effect does ethnocentrism have on the strategic management of diversity? STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 8 The subquestions RQ4a and RQ4b stress the central question and focuse on the impacts of ethnocentrism and globalization on organizational strategies for managing diversity. The primary question, RQ4 'What consequences do globalization and ethnocentrism have in managing diversity?' looked at the effects of globalization and ethnocentrism and their relations to managing diversity in the workplace. Researchers found that exclusiveness and ethnocentrism are positively correlated in the corporate context and have dysfunctional consequences, posits Moore (1962). The cultural trends associated with globalization include convergence, divergence, hybridization, the clash of cultures, diversity, multiculturalism, risk, insecurity, and uncertainty, according to Yeganeh (2020). One of globalization's most visible cultural consequences is convergence because it pushes cultures toward homogeneity without leaving any space for diversities, argues Yeganeh. Nature of the Study The research paradigm used a constructivism and transformative framework to study the global business environment in which demographic diversity of the workforce has become a reality, leading to the challenges modern management faces in turning their organizations competitive in the world marketplace. According to (Robson & McCartan, 2016), a qualitative research paradigm has been historically linked to positivism, not without criticism that has made the link problematic, and is now largely superseded by the post-positivist approach. According to the authors, the qualitative research paradigm also highlights a social constructivism view in which interactions between people construct social properties as they interact and engage in interpretation and how they make sense of the world around them. From a constructivist perspective, this study focused on the context in which people live, work, and use their STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 9 experiences to empower others to share their stories and hear their voices through the power of relationships between the researcher and the participants (Creswell & Poth, 2018).  This case study would illuminate leaders' decisions concerning managing workforce diversity, why such decisions are made, how they are implemented, and the outcomes of those decisions. Furthermore, the nature of the study encompassed reporting values and biases of information gathering from the field concerning gender, race, age, subjective experiences, and beliefs (Berger, 2015; Creswell & Poth, 2018). In summary, the nature of this study revolved around effectively managing diversity based on all participants’ perceptions about diversity, its impact on individual identity, and organizational performance. With the growing trend of virtual teams, achieving collaboration across cultural and linguistic barriers is necessary; therefore, group inclusiveness and exemplary leadership become essential for team member performance (Lauring & Jonasson, 2018). Therefore, a social constructivist approach was taken. Discussion of Research Paradigms Single Case Study Design Social scientists believe case studies are appropriate for exploring the phase of investigating a social phenomenon, posits Yin (2018). This case study explored the philosophical assumption and interpretive paradigm of the lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity based on the social constructivism framework. A flexible design using qualitative methods, specifically a single case study design, was used in this study. A case study design was chosen because the research questions are open-ended and ask how and what questions. In addition, the researcher has no control over behavioral events, for the study focused on a recent social event.  Moreover, the case study approach allowed the researcher to understand a complex social situation, such as managing diversity in the workplace and retaining a real-world perspective. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 10 Thus, the reason for choosing to use a case study. The essence of a case study research conducted in organizations is to illuminate processes and programs, why leaders make confident decisions, how these decisions will be implemented, and the outcomes of those decisions. With a gap in leadership strategies in corporations and higher education, this case study would be a good guideline so that auditors could, in principle, repeat the procedures and hopefully arrive at the same results of effective leadership in managing diversity, Yin (2018).  This case study aimed to identify strategic leadership questions about effectively managing diversity to help empower employees and cultivate a happy working environment. Consequently, to improve workforce diversity management, this study focused on processes and procedures leaders could practice to enhance diversity and inclusion in domestic and global organizations for competitive advantage. Researchers also bring value to their studies by reporting their biases and value-laden information gathered from the field, argue Creswell and Poth (2018). They must identify their positionality concerning the research setting, such as their individual experiences and political or professional beliefs Berger (2015). The Positivism Paradigm The quantitative research paradigm is associated with positivism, which is now being superseded by a post-positivist approach because of criticisms from researchers (Robson & McCartan, 2016). With a positivist notion, researchers who support it argue that science is credible and possible because every scientist looking at the same bit of reality sees the same thing. Still, critics claim that what the observers see is not determined by the characteristics of the observed thing because the observer's perspectives also have an effect, argue Robson and McCartan. For example, two individuals looking at managing diversity in the workplace may have different views on examining the event. The only knowledge available to science is STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 11 objective knowledge that can only be gained from direct experience or observation, and other theoretical entities are rejected (Robson & McCartan, 2016). The other principles argue that science separates facts from values; science is based mainly on quantitative data; scientific propositions are founded by facts (for more on these principles, see Robson & McCartan, 2016, p. 22). Critiques reject most positivist-based science principles. Positivism is based on universal laws that govern social events, and discovering these laws enable researchers to describe, predict and control social sensations, according to Tuli (2010). Post-Positivism Paradigm According to Robson and McCartan (2016), post-positivism is not a unitary school of thought but a group of theorists who share some views. They believe that evidence in research is not always perfect; that there is no absolute warrant for knowledge; that research is a process that makes a claim, helps to explain the circumstance, or describes causal relationships; that knowledge is both a rational and social activity based on power, politics, and ideology (Phillips & Burbules, 2000, pp. 29–43). In summary, followers of quantitative research are divided into two camps, those on the positivist path and those on the post-positivist way, in contrast to the philosophical underpinnings of qualitative research. Researchers contend that the golden age was marked by the debunking of positivism by the emergence of post-positivism and designs that used mixed quantitative and qualitative methods; post-positivism emphasizes the concepts of critical realism and aims to explain events based on prediction and control (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). The Constructionism Paradigm Qualitative research emphasizes the world of experience as it is lived, felt, and undergone by people acting in social situations (Schwandt, 2007). This qualitative paradigm would be the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 12 coverage needed to survey social constructionism, a broadly based mainstream of qualitative research. It indicates that social properties are constructed through interactions between people (Robson & McCartan, 2016). However, according to Robson and McCartan, there are as many realities as there are participants because of different individual perspectives. The researcher's task is comprehending various constructs of meaning and knowledge, posit Robson and McCartan. There are other paradigms, such as post-modernism, posthumanism, and pragmatism. A constructivist approach was appropriate to this case study of managing diversity in the workplace for the reasons mentioned above. There are differences between quantitative and qualitative approaches, and the main distinction is that quantitative approach relies on variances, and qualitative approach on processes, argues Mohr (1982). Quantitative research tends to view the world in terms of variables with statistical relationships between variables, and qualitative research tends to see the world in terms of people, events, and the processes that connect them; these processes orient toward the world, specific situations, people rather than numbers, Maxwell (2012). In summary, constructivist ontology claims that individuals and socially constructed reality construct their knowledge that guides the qualitative methodology, which prescribes flexible design, posits Tuli (2010). The Pragmatism Paradigm Pragmatism is theoretical and philosophical and is rooted in the post-realist tradition; as such, it privileges practice and method over reflection and deliberate actions, claim Denzin and Lincoln (2018). Seale et al. (2004), who contested what they regard as \"anything goes\" in other paradigms, proposed a practice-based, pragmatic approach that places practice at the center of research. They claimed that research involves an engagement, a variety of things, and people called research materials, social theories, philosophical debates, values, and methods; they STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 13 believe that stories should not be accepted if they do not accord with the facts. In reality, stories deal with abstracts and facts about people, events, and both abstracts and facts are used in qualitative research. These pragmatic procedural arguments reproduce a variant of the evidence-based model against many traditions and strands of qualitative research (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). According to Denzin and Lincoln, action researchers are committed to a set of material practices that produce radical, democratizing societal transformation that involves collaborative dialogue, participatory decision-making, inclusive deliberation, and representation of all relevant parties. According to Denzin and Lincoln, pragmatics researchers help transform inquiry into praxis and action. On a closer look, this paradigm may provide strategies for social change, such as managing diversity in the workplace. For Robson and McCartan (2016), a pragmatic research approach indicates concern for practical matters, and it is guided by practical experience to get on with the job rather than theory. Still, external pragmatism should be resisted because it can affect research's independence, credibility, and rigor. Pragmatism rejects traditional dualism, such as rationalism vs. empiricism facts vs. values, and prefers moderate and commonsense versions of dualism based on how well they work on solving problems, note Robson and McCartan. Summary Paradigms determine how researchers view the situation being studied, the design, and the research methodology employed to learn why people do what they do. Every researcher works from their paradigm or worldview about the nature of knowledge and reality, which helps them clarify their theoretical framework, argue cohen et al. (2011). According to Tuli (2010), researchers’ perspectives can vary because of cultural, philosophical, or professional lenses; one STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 14 researcher can seek evidence using patterned behavior in trends and associations. Others focus on how people understand the world around them. Discussion of Design Fixed Design This study was conducted with a flexible design using qualitative methods; specifically, a single case study design was used. Fixed designs are theory-driven, and the design of the study is fixed before data collection takes place; the researchers have to specify in advance the variables to be included in the research and the exact procedures to be followed by having a well-articulated theory of the social event being studied (Robson & McCartan, 2016). According to the authors, the weakness of fixed designs is their inability to capture the subtleties and complexities of individual behaviors; for this reason, other techniques are introduced, such as flexible designs or multi-strategy designs, to capture individual intricacies as well as group aggregates. A fixed design strategy is appropriate for descriptive studies; the researcher should know the results and how to analyze them before data collection. The advantage of a fixed design is its ability to transcend individual differences and identify patterns linked to social structures, organizations, and groups (Robson & McCartan, 2016). Researchers remain more physically and emotionally distant from the study in a fixed design. Therefore, this approach does not fit a flexible research design in which the researcher must collaborate with people to gain a firm grasp of the issues being studied by asking questions with an enquiring mind, posit Robson and McCartan. The positivist ontology that guides quantitative methodology prescribes fixed design which is a more restrictive option; it claims that objective, single reality must be studied without the researcher’s perspective by advocating the detachment of the knower and the things to be known, notes Tuli (2010). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 15 Flexible Design  Robson and McCartan (2016) found that in all areas of social research, it is now acceptable to use designs based on methods of qualitative data collection, with the exceptions in fields of medicine and in areas of experimental psychology where quantitative designs are appropriate, needless to say, qualitative designs can use quantitative methods of data collection too. Thus, the term flexible design. With qualitative research study, flexible designs are commonly used with case studies, ethnographic studies, and grounded theory studies in which multiple qualitative data collection and some quantitative data are possible; it is an evolving design with a presentation of various realities, and focuses on participant's views, with a rigorous approach to data collection and analysis, argue Robson and McCartan. A flexible design study, such as this one for strategic leadership in managing diversity, was chosen for this research because a qualitative flexible research objective is to develop an understanding or discover a social situation in detail and much depth, Zikmund et al. (2013). Qualitative research with a flexible design focuses on the theory that depends on the researcher’s view, learning about the experience within networks of people, events, and relationships and making visible power hierarchies (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Mixed Methods Design Yin (2018) claims that studies using mixed-methods research are more challenging to execute than other studies limited to single methods. Still, it can enable a researcher to address broader research questions than a case study alone. In a mixed method, researchers combine quantitative and qualitative research techniques, methods, approaches, and concepts into a single study (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004, p. 17). One distinction is that mixed methods should not be confused with flexible design methods, for mixed-methods research must not include case study research, according to Yin, because in case studies, quantitative components have a minor STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 16 role and are viewed as a flexible strategy rather than multi-strategy designs (Robson & McCartan, 2016, p. 150). Researchers are becoming interested and adopting mixed-methods research by combining quantitative and qualitative research techniques and approaches into a single study, argues Yin (2018). This mixing of methods allows them to address more complicated research questions and an array of evidence not possible to accomplish by any single approach alone. Discuss the Appropriateness of Flexible Designs A flexible design in this case study is appropriate because it is a well-established research strategy focusing on what is happening in organizations and social events (Robson & McCartan, 2016). This flexible study design involved multiple data collection methods, including qualitative data and quantitative data; the ability of data collection using different techniques and sources fitted well for this study. The particular thing about a flexible design is that one does not know the results and how they will be analyzed before the data is collected. Robson and McCartan claim that a flexible design is a work in progress and can adapt as the research evolves; it also emphasizes the relationship between the researcher and the researched within the boundary of the case being studied. Thus, a flexible design was the best choice for this study. Doing a flexible design research involves the researcher as an instrument; it requires the researcher to have an open and enquiring mind, be sensitive and responsive to contradictory evidence, and rely on their experiences and training rather than on specialist tools and instruments, argue Robson and McCartan. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 17 Discussion of Method Narrative Research A narrative study focuses on the life of individuals, focuses on a single individual or several individuals, and collects stories about issues related to the individual's life; it tells a story about what is happening, how to describe it, and how the participants in the narrative interact or perform; the researchers use reflexive thinking and writing in narrative research (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Researchers treat narratives as social interaction in interpersonal, cultural, institutional, and historical contexts, argued Chase (2005). They also define narratives as social actions, such as doing or accomplishing something, defending, persuading, entertaining, and constructing versions of self, others, and the social world (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). Phenomenology  A phenomenology articulates a circumstance that conveys an understanding of the philosophical tenets of an event; it uses recommended data analysis procedures by communicating the overall essence of the participants' experience, including the context, and embeds reflexivity throughout the study, posit Creswell and Poth (2018). According to Robson and McCartan (2016), phenomenological research focuses on understanding how humans view themselves and the world around them; it seeks to reveal and convey deep insight and understanding of the meaning of everyday life experiences. Phenomenology and hermeneutics approaches are carried out with flexible design research; both studies focus on the rigor and trustworthiness of findings, Giorgi (2005). Phenomenology focuses on a concept or observable fact and the reality of the lived experiences of individuals about that event, according to Creswell and Poth. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 18 Grounded Theory According to Denzin and Lincoln (2018), grounded theory is a powerful qualitative method for social justice inquiry; it is a flexible method for constructing theories from data that support researching social psychological processes. A grounded theory studies vital elements in theory, including processes, actions, and others; it integrates a coding process that works from the data to a larger theoretical model; it advances propositions that connect categories in the theoretical model and the researcher in a grounded theory self-discloses their stance, Creswell and Poth (2018). According to the authors, grounded theory is developed from successive conceptual analysis of data, and researchers use it for purposes such as exploration, description, and problem-solving in applied practice. The grounded theory aims to develop a theory, whereas, in ethnography, it is to describe a culture-sharing society, argue John Creswell and Cheryl Poth. Ethnography  Ethnography research identifies a culture-sharing group by specifying and examining a cultural theme in light of this culture-sharing group; by identifying issues that arose in the field, communicating themes derived from an understanding of the cultural group, describing, and explaining how the culture-sharing group works overall, claim Creswell and Poth (2018). With ethnography research, the researcher integrates reflexivity about their position; the research method is a potent conceptual one that exposes the dynamic of interactions between power, politics, and poetics and challenges researchers to represent these interactions to make interventions that produce new understandings that generate just circumstances (Madison, 2008, p. 392; Denzin & Lincoln, 2018, p. 360). In an ethnographic study, the researcher must study the participants in a natural setting and participate in what is happening there (McCartney, 2016); in consideration, an ethnographic method does not fit this case study. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 19 Case Study  A case study is a method that rationalizes case selection in terms of understandings generated by identifying themes for the case (or across cases), reporting assertions or generalizations from the case analysis with a detailed description of the case, posit Creswell and  Poth (2018). Researchers use a strategy of inquiry to bundle skills, assumptions, and practices as they move from their paradigm to the real world. This approach connects the researcher to specific methods of collecting and analyzing empirical materials, such as case study that relies on interviewing, observing, and document analysis (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). In a case study, a specific case was studied, e.g., managing diversity in the workplace, with the intent of examining the process with the case, such as a lack of leadership, to illustrate the issue's complexity. The Appropriateness of this Single Case Study A case study was appropriate for this research because it dealt with individuals, groups, or organizations. In general, (Robson & McCartan, 2016) agree that a case study is a well-suited research strategy focusing on a case that widely includes the study of a person, group, or organization by considering its context. A case study also involves multiple data collection methods, including qualitative and quantitative data. Following the lead of Yin (2009), a case study strategy for doing research involves an empirical investigation of a recent case within a real-life context, which fits this research study appropriately. Single-case research is invaluable when the study is critical, extreme, familiar, revelatory, or longitudinal, such as managing diversity in the workplace, believes Yin (2018). The other methods are suited for other research because of the limitations of using a case study. For example, a fixed approach is usually adopted when the study seeks to establish a causal relationship; moreover, using mixed-method research is more challenging to execute than studies limited to a single case method, such as this single STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 20 case study, but can permit researchers to address more complicated research questions, argued (Yin, 2018). This case study approach was to study in-depth the impact strategic leadership has in managing diversity in the workplace with consideration of other factors such as the participants, the resources available to guide the work, including the meaning of concepts and theories, as explained by (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Discussion of Triangulation Mixed Method and Triangulation Triangulation is the process researchers or investigators use to corroborate evidence from different sources to illuminate a theme or perspective; they are doing it to provide validity to their findings, argued (Creswell & Poth,  2018). In the literature, triangulation is also used to integrate mixed-method research concepts that study issues around social justice topics (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). Methodological triangulation is used in mixed methods (e.g., using different subscales in a questionnaire), according to (Denzin, 1970/1978, p. 297), or between methods. The methodological concept of triangulation involves the process of playing each method off against the other to maximize the validity of field effort, posits Denzin. Researchers acknowledge that theoretical triangulation does not reduce bias or increase validity; it also adds to the debate and critique of triangulation in social research, such as mixed methods in which Methodological triangulation methods are combined to check one another, looking for different strengths and limitations when dealing with validity threats, argued Denzin and Lincoln. Flexible Design and Triangulation With flexible design, Robson and McCartan (2016) found that triangulation is widely used to use multiple sources to enhance research rigor. Denzin (1988a) distinguished four types of triangulation in flexible designs. These include data triangulation using interviews and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 21 documents, observer triangulation using several observers in the study, methodological triangulation combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, and theory triangulation using multiple theories. Denzin (1970/1978) introduced the idea of triangulation as a strategy of validation using different data sources with various perspectives in mind. Also, Greene (2007) argued that triangulation to confirm a conclusion is overrated in flexible design or mixed-method research and creates a more complex understanding of situations. From another angle, Maxwell (2012) thinks that collecting information from different sources is a strategy that reduces the risk of chance association and biases due to specific methods and allows a better assessment of the explanation that one develops. Still, the findings from Fielding and Fielding (1986) claimed that triangulation does not automatically increase validity. Triangulation, thus, is being debated by researchers on both sides of qualitative and quantitative research. Summary  Researchers need to recognize the fallibility of any method and to triangulate in terms of validity threats no matter its particular sources, rather than relying on the selection of methods because, according to Maxwell (2013), validity threats are made implausible by evidence instead of methods. In this same vein, Greene (2007) argued that triangulation using different ways is most valuable for divergent perspectives for understanding social situations. As noted by Greene et al. (1989), researchers have purposes for using triangulation to seek convergence and corroboration of results from different designs studying a real-world situation. One way to strengthen a study design is through triangulation or combining methodologies with studying the same action under investigation (Patton, 1990). Triangulation is based on the premise that one single method can never be sufficient to solve the problem of rival causal factors, argue Denzin (1978). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 22 Research Framework Building a conceptual framework begins with personal interests or goals and working with questions from which the researcher begins to construct a conceptual framework that would shape the design and direction of the research (Ravitch & Riggan, 2017). It is also necessary to use the individual and collective expertise to guide the researcher about framing, structuring, and approaching a research study, posit Ravitch and Riggan. In the literature, researchers use terms to define a conceptual framework, terms that refer to different things, according to Ravitch and Riggan. Some researchers view it as a visual representation of studies of organizations or events found in literature reviews or other documents; others treat the conceptual framework as a way of linking elements of the research process, such as the researcher's interest, goal, identity, and positionality, context and setting, formal and informal theory and methods (Ravitch & Carl, 2016).  In the same line of thought, Ravitch and Riggan (2017) claimed that \" a conceptual framework is an argument about why the topic one wishes to study matters, and why the means proposed to study it are appropriate and rigorous\" (p. 5). In their work, Miles et al. (2014) claimed that a conceptual framework represents the graphical construct, the participants, variables, concepts, facts, and the presumed relationships among them and is theory-driven. Maxwell (2013) defines a conceptual framework as a system of concepts, assumptions, expectations, beliefs, and theories that inform research and is something constructed, not found.     STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 23 Figure 1. Conceptual Framework Diagram  Concepts Moral Values and Ethics Influence Diversity Leadership in organizations is responsible for raising moral values, working capacity, and organizational performance (Avolio & Bass, 2004). Leaders at the helm in the workplace fuel the drives necessary for planning and implementing ethical standards for managing diversity, according to Engelbrecht et al. (2018). Human resources management's (HRM) responsibility is to carry moral values to realize organizations' strategic objectives to meet the expectations and needs of all stakeholders, including employees. These objectives include developing, motivating, and retaining a high-performance workforce regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or other dissimilar characteristics (Mondy, 2017, p.4; Barutçugil, 2004, p. 32). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 24 Cultural Competencies Enhance Awareness According to Yong (2019), cultural diversity drives economic creativity and prosperity in Europe, a popular destination becoming culturally diverse for talented immigrants worldwide. The author argues that these European studies provide information to help understand the link between cultural diversity and organizational performance. Based on these findings, cultural competencies can support and enable leaders to manage diversity effectively in the workplace. Cultural competency is defined as the knowledge and ability to understand, communicate with, and value people from different cultural backgrounds and negotiate differences from multiple perspectives to create synergy (Rivera et al., 2010). Diversity Stimulates Innovation  According to a study conducted by (Adiguzel & Cakir, 2020), innovation and company performance are linked to diversity management activities; therefore, it is crucial to effectively manage a diverse workforce with different ideas and thoughts within organizations. Innovation is one factor for assessing an organization's success and is influenced by various organizational strategies (Wu et al., 2019). Researchers have found a link between a diverse workforce, creativity, and innovation. According to (Schubert & Tavassoli, 2020), in many modern organizations, especially those operating globally, promoting diversity is important because of its effects on innovation. Diversity Practices Promote Trust in Leadership In organizations, when employees trust their leaders, the workplace environment can develop capabilities and interrelationships among coworkers, which creates an environment that opens the willingness to share knowledge, allowing the organization to achieve its objectives and become a learning organization, argue (Raza & Tariq, 2016). According to Liggans (2017), trust STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 25 in leadership reveals that organizational inclusion and HR diversity practices have positive relationships with organizational commitment. Given that employee commitment impacts productivity and turnover, understanding workplace inclusion and trust in leadership is potentially crucial to agency recruitment and retention efforts, argues Liggans. Leadership Behaviors Positively or Negatively Affect Diversity In many organizations, people at the top of the ladder say all the right things about diversity; still, the middle managers who run the organization do not follow suit and do not feel accountable for diversity and inclusion (Ng & Sears, 2020). In the same vein, CEOs claim they value diversity, but their words do not translate into observable diversity efforts or outcomes (Braga, 2017; Christian, 2014). Moreover, researchers found that inclusive leadership behaviors can minimize diversity's adverse effects and contribute to inclusiveness in organizations' teams (Ashikali et al., 2020; Randel et al., 2018). Inclusion means replacing hierarchical, top-down authority with a model of shared governance and decision-making (Blanchard & Broadwell, 2018). Globalization Transforms Business Reality According to (Tamasauskiene & Žičkienė, 2021), globalization has created conditions in which income inequality, influenced by several dimensions such as trade, financial, political, and social practices, is widening and defined by policies that benefit the few and alienate others. This political globalization demonstrates that the liberalization of restrictions on the flow of goods and services across borders helps large companies rather than small enterprises, argue the authors. The clash between individual and group rights is at the heart of many confrontations related to diversity and globalization, according to Nieto (2013). In the education arena, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 26 globalization and diversity are crucial for educators to understand that one can learn a great deal from the experiences of others in teaching students the importance of diversity, Banks (2009). Summary Any research framework includes beliefs about reality and humanity - ontology, the research epistemology - knowledge, and the strategy that brought about differences in the type of research methodologies, argue Tuli (2010). This section of the research introduces three topics related to qualitative research: the research design, methods, and triangulation. The research design is the framework that guides the strategy or methodology for implementation, including flexible and mixed-method designs. The methods examine the five approaches used today with qualitative research: Case study, narrative theory, grounded theory, ethnography research, and phenomenology theory. Each theory has been described differently from the others in a qualitative research study. Triangulation, as described above, is being debated for its use as a validation tool or a strategy for gathering data from several sources with various perspectives in mind; it is used in both mixed and flexible methods. Fixed methods use other forms of validation. Triangulation is the solution of relying on a single data source by comparing and cross-checking the consistency of information within methods; it is a strategy to reduce systematic bias by checking findings against other sources and perspectives. Theories Servant Leadership According to McCallaghan et al. (2020), the possible solution to gaining full benefits associated with diversity and minimizing its negative effect might be found in leadership. A study from South Africa found that servant leaders have characteristics that distinguish them from other leadership styles, including authenticity, humility, integrity, listening, compassion, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 27 and accountability, which suit them well for managing a diverse workforce (Coetzer et al., 2017, p. 19). Because of globalization and workforce diversification, organizations are geared to improve approaches to diversity management practices and create a climate that entails how employees appreciate and form impressions on how organizations perform in the face of diversity, argue McCallaghan et al. Inclusive Leadership Employers have implemented equal opportunity and affirmative action policies; however, workforce diversity can increase team conflict and decrease group cohesion. According to Ashikali et al. (2021), managing diversity is a complex process with multiple conflicting motives underlying diversity policies and management in organizations. Research shows a diverse, inclusive climate can improve job satisfaction, motivation, and performance. It ensures different perspectives and experiences are brought in with a spectrum of visions available to address organizational problems and challenges, argues Riccucci (2018, p. 26).  Transformational Leadership In higher education, transformational leadership correlates with increased morale and satisfaction among faculty and staff. It is found to be effective in ensuring an effective diversity management system. It is also effective in hampering diversity management programs for tertiary institutions located in homogeneous populated areas, according to Brown et al. (2019). Also, according to Sharif (2019), in a dynamic social environment, transformational leadership is seen as an opportunity appropriate for the female leadership model because it is primarily driven by loyalty, respect, and trust. According to Appiah and Agboola (2021), diversity and inclusion management serves as a lever for efficiency and profitability that may be driven by transformational leadership that gives direction to any organization, Hiatt et al. (2019).  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 28 Critical Race Theory  Critical race theory studies and transforms the relationship between race, racism, and power deeply embedded within American society's framework (Delgado & Stefancic, 2012; Parker & Lynn, 2002). Its goals are first to present stories about discrimination practices; second, it argues for the eradication of racial subjugation while recognizing that race is a social construct; and third, it addresses other areas of differences, such as gender, class, and any inequities experienced by individuals, posit Parker and Lynn. Critical race theory is not about pleadings or race-baiting; it is also not the paradigm that makes a scholar seem more cutting-edge or avant-garde; it is about the severe permanent and systemic racism that ultimately diminishes the democratic project; it is about dispelling notions of color-blindness and postracial imaginings so that one can better understand the prevalent disparities in society; it is a tool one can use to assert that race still matters (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). Feminism Theory Feminism, according to Butler (2004, p. 204), is about the social transformation of gender relations, the quest for justice to reduce gender inequality by improving women's interests in achieving equity through structural change, posits Walby (2011). Feminism is drawn from several orientations, different international contexts, and other dynamic developments, which center on and make problematic women’s diverse situations and the institutions that frame those situations posits (Olesen, 2011). Research on the topic may include postcolonial thought of forms of feminism in the context of nationalism, globalization, and diverse international contexts, including sex workers, domestic servants, about specific groups of women, including lesbians, women with disabilities, and women of color (Olesen, 2011). Monticelli (2020) STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 29 underlines the alternatives to capitalism's dominant social-economic system based on social movements and critical social theory.  Actors The actors in this study are leaders, including H.R. Director, upper-level managers, Middle Managers, and their subordinates in the Western African region that rely on technology to run their organizations. The Researcher The researcher tried to understand the real-world events that affected these participants in the study. The researcher was responsible for interviewing and asking research questions to understand the Whys and Whats of social phenomena. Participants.  There were 15 participants who worked for the same organization located in West Africa and have lived and experienced the phenomena of being different in the social settings of an organization with a diverse workforce. Constructs Top Executives can Promote Diversity      According to Ankur et al. (2019), leaders must implement policies that address employment equity, nurture inclusion that supports a safe environment for all employees, and promote diversity. The authors claimed that leaders must avoid biases based on institutional practices, such as job advertisement and recruitment, perpetuating a lack of equity, diversity, and inclusiveness. Studies conducted by Corneille et al. (2019) claimed that advancing women and faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics requires an institutional culture that promotes equity through organizational structures that empower and facilitate leadership STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 30 positions for underrepresented groups such as women of all ethnicities in the academic. Their study recommended promoting systemic change in institutions and faculty for marginalized groups and embracing intersectionality and transformation approaches. Process-centered intersectionality emphasizes the strategies that address the relational nature of power, posit Corneille et al. In their research, Ye et al. (2018) highlight the importance of inclusive leadership to promote employee learning behaviors of all genders and ethnicities of all groups. Organizational Moral Values Contribute to Workplace Happiness      According to (Yaghi & Al-Jenaibi (2018), happiness in the work environment has become a new paradigm that guides policymaking and implementation in organizations (Ballas, 2013; Tideman, 2016) and could be looked at as a strategic goal of happiness. According to Yaghi and Al-Jenaibi, adopting a happiness strategy for employees is a shift with a moral foundation relevant to organizational development. Studies show that people's happiness improves the relationships between themselves and their leadership (Frey & Stutzer, 2010; Jahromi, 2015). In organizations, satisfaction with management, relational transparency, and internal moral perspectives can positively influence employees' happiness (Ana Suzete et al., 2017). The authors also claim that authentic leaders nourish employees' satisfaction, leading to creativity.  Change at the top of Management can Produce Differences      In the male-dominated work environment, transformational leadership change at the top plays an integral part in organizational leadership. In many countries, women assume different roles, but the time is now to make a shift that makes women play a part in organizational leadership (Elshenawy, 2017; Sharif, 2019). Change at the top of the executive agenda, calls for transformational leadership, and bringing women to the forefront could influence approaches to effective leadership. According to Brown et al. (2019), a study to determine the ideal leadership STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 31 styles to drive organizational change toward diversity and inclusion provides insights into transactional and transformational leadership styles to bring about change (Adserias et al., 2017). Based on their findings, one can conclude that change at the top management in organizations calls for transformational leadership. Ethnocentrism and Nationalism are Predictors of Exclusiveness       With the effect of globalization, the relations between civic and ethnocultural forms have blurred lines, and people believe that the existence of a civic nation can legitimate the practices of ethnocultural exclusion, argue (Zhuravlev & Ishchenko, 2020). In their study, the authors show that ethnocentrism and nationalism remain challenging in the contemporary business discourse. Nationalism can be as exclusivist as ethnocultural nationalism, and the civic vs. ethnocultural nationalism dichotomy is nevertheless fruitful, according to Zhuravlev and Ishchenko. With the fear of globalization, people think that globalization is directly opposed to the interests of their ethnic groups and nations, according to Bizumic (2019). As a result, individuals show ethnic attitudes in ethnocentrism and nationalism; for example, many white Americans feel like strangers in their land and are reasserting their ethnocentric and nationalistic attitudes to gain control of their land, posits Hochschild (2016). In recent years, the Productivity Commission of Australia has seen rising protectionism, ethnocentric and nationalistic sentiments worldwide, notes Bizumic. From a management perspective, diversity is valued as a resource to inform work practices and policies Groeneveld, 2015; Groeneveld & Van de Walle, 2010). According to Ashikali et al. (2021), The organizational rationale reflects diversity motives for increasing diversity in the workforce or paying attention to diversity (Ely & Thomas, 2001).  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 32 Relationships Between Concepts, Theories, Actors, and Constructs According to Miles et al. (2014), a conceptual framework is filled with intellectual bins constituted of theories, circumstances, personal experience, constructs, and variables; a conceptual framework is theory-driven. According to Miles et al., culture, social intelligence, identity, and coping are the labels on intellectual containers. Developing an understanding of the relationships among the containers helps the researcher toward a conceptual framework, which is both a process and product of analytic reflection, posit Miles et al. According to Zikmund et al. (2013), researchers use logical deduction to build theories. The purpose of a theory is understanding and predicting. Theories enable researchers to gain knowledge and describe what is happening and situations because, without explaining observable facts, a researcher would not know where to start, posit Zikmund et al.  According to Zikmund et al. (2013), understanding and predicting enable researchers to link abstract concepts to observable reality by building theories that allow them to predict behaviors or characteristics and anticipate environmental or organizational conditions. Concepts or constructs are ideas of a class of objects, as used in object-oriented programming; constructs are an object of attributes, processes, participants, and organizations and are the building block and units of theory development, claim Zikmund et al. Moreover, theories require an understanding of the relationships among concepts. In research, propositions explain the logical relationships among concepts. For example, one might propose empowering employees will make them more productive; the concept is the logical link between a leadership action and employee reactions. In sum, the relationships between concepts, theories, actors, and constructs, the units of a framework, are essential for guiding researchers toward a conceptual framework, an abstract picture of the observable event they are trying to understand and describe. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 33 Summary of the Research Framework A theoretical framework and its parts, the theories, are the backbone and the guiding light of a research study. This framework is constructed by the researcher for the purpose of the study or borrowed from another research, according to Ravitch and Riggan (2017). Theories explain the types of relationships found in the research framework and are critical for achieving cohesion across the elements or units of the framework, argue Ravitch and Riggan. A framework rooted in the leadership management of diversity may focus on concepts related to culture, ethnicity, identity, behaviors, human resources practices, employees, and leadership and how these concepts are interrelated. According to Maxwell (2012), a conceptual framework evolves and changes during a study because new ideas from data collection will influence the whole process. A conceptual framework is a grounded argument about why study matters; it is the process of understanding the inquiry and the questions of the investigation; it helps determine what is already known and not yet known, argue Ravitch and Riggan. The research framework helps researchers explain the world, determine the cause of what is happening, and make sense of them by providing a systematic method to assess and find out why things happen, posit Zikmund et al. (2013). A conceptual framework represents people's abstract picture of events and circumstances to comprehend the world. According to (Eisenhardt, 1989; Rule & John, 2015), theory development in research is time-consuming and challenging, but existing works may provide a rich theoretical framework for research design. Definition of Terms The interest in this topic of strategic leadership in managing diversity came from the researcher's personal and professional experiences and the desire to understand the phenomenon better. Looking through the lenses of social constructs, the researcher has found themes in the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 34 literature that relate to the process of managing a diverse workforce in a global business environment. These themes include (1) awakened leadership, (2) social leadership, (3) inclusive Leadership in the workplace, (4) integration and learning in organizations, and (5) Inclusive climate. Each term is defined and reviewed in-depth throughout the text to show how each element can impact the process of managing diversity.  1. Awakened Leadership Awakened leadership is the continued awareness in thoughts, actions, and communications one has in making decisions, considering the perspectives of others by keeping an open mind, and questioning, even doubt, established patterns and procedures created when expectations, circumstances, and mindsets were different (Marques, 2018). According to Marques, awakened leadership starts with a change in motives and perspectives that everything on this planet is interconnected, that everything one does, affects everyone else in the world, and that every bad thing one ignores, one approves of, and that one has the responsibility to make the world a better for all. Awakened leadership is the opposite of sleepwalking leadership, the trend of making decisions without considering that everything is in constant change; reality is not the same as others see it, and patterns or habits can drive one into an autopilot state, remarks Marques. 2. Inclusive Climate A research study conducted by Ali et al. (2018) supports the existence of relationships between inclusive climate as the condition and knowledge sharing and the mechanism between team diversity and creativity. An inclusive climate is defined as the perception of diverse team members of fair treatment, acceptance of differences, and decision-making sharing in a team (Nishii, 2013). An inclusive climate fosters an environment where employees feel less discrimination and facilitates interpersonal relationships and knowledge sharing that leads to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 35 positive behavior and outcomes, posit Ali et al. According to Ashikali et al. (2020), an inclusive climate is a prerequisite for inclusion.  3. Inclusive Leadership Inclusive leaders are individuals aware of their biases, seek different perspectives to inform their decisions, and exhibit openness in their interactions with followers, Carmeli et al. (2010). Randel et al. (2018) define inclusive leadership as a set of positive leader behaviors that facilitate the perceptions of followers’ belongingness while maintaining their uniqueness within the group. Inclusive leadership has the power to influence diversity management in organizations and team outcomes. 4. Integration and Learning Integration and learning in organizations can be defined as the process that reflects how organizations manage diversity ethically. According to Dwertmann et al. (2016), organizational integration and learning approaches to diversity reflect an effective way of managing diversity because it fosters inclusion. Employees with a high value for diversity will likely recognize ethical values in organizational integration and learning approaches to diversity, such as trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship (Schwartz 2005). Rabl et al. (2020) found that employees' perceptions of an organizational integration and learning approach to diversity positively relate to corporate ethical virtues. 5. Social Leadership (Guglielmo & Palsule, 2016) define the social leader as one who can harness the passions of networks of individuals by generating the social energy necessary to achieve a common purpose. The social age has arrived, and public and private spaces are disappearing; information is finding itself in the social space and is accessible to all through technology, argue Guglielmo and Palsule STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 36 (2016). According to the authors, social leadership tenets include mindfulness, proactivity, authenticity, openness, and social scalability. These tenets were reviewed in-depth in the text. This study aimed to provide organizations with the knowledge to make strategic changes in leadership to gain a competitive advantage in the era of rapidly shifting demographics, including women, people of color, immigrants, baby boomers, and millennium working side by side, argues Riccucci (2018). This study would help organizations implement strategies that promote diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace, Dajnoki et al. (2017). It would provide organizations with the leadership knowledge they can rely on to effectively resolve the problems of the rarity of women and minorities in leadership positions by increasing their representation posit (Choi et al., 2018; Sidhu et al., 2020). Finally, this study would help organizations create leadership strategies to promote job satisfaction and organizational success by creating an inclusive climate for their diverse workforce. Assumptions, Limitations, Delimitations Whether researchers are aware of it, they bring certain beliefs and philosophical assumptions to their research. These are deeply ingrained views about the types of problems they must study based on research questions or how they collect data (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Several assumptions in managing diversity include the following: Similarity-attraction minimizes relationship conflicts; the male is the sole source of leadership; human diversity can be reduced to a set of boxes and grouping, such as race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, and religion. With this single case study conducted in one organization in West Africa, the limitations include the sample size being too small to generalize or assess the productivity and acceptability. The sample size could concern the number of participants, estimating the sample size for purposive interviews or focus groups. The delimitations of the study of strategy for STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 37 managing diversity included the fact that this was a single case study conducted within one organization and a small sample of investigated participants. Assumptions Researchers face difficulties when conducting research; one of these difficulties lies first in becoming aware of their assumptions and beliefs and then deciding whether they will incorporate them into their qualitative studies (Creswell & Poth, 2018). The philosophical assumptions inform the researchers' choice of theories, research questions, and data gathering that guide the research, argued Creswell and Poth. In their study, Miller et al. (2019) confirmed that the assumptions of social identity and the similarity-attraction do not necessarily lead to positive relationship outcomes such as minimizing conflicts and promoting greater trust. They also identify conditions where demographic similarity can lead to adverse effects and perceived similarities and differences depending on social context. The assumption that individuals converge on similar norms, values, and beliefs based on their similarities is not always the case, argued Miller et al. Several mitigation strategies can be developed to deal with these assumptions. Korsgaard et al. (2008) found that increased communication may mitigate conflict, while other scholars suggest that ongoing communication creates trust between group members. Researchers can utilize triangulation or make specific biases explicit and avoid judgmental orientation to mitigate some of these assumptions, according to Fetterman (2019). The mitigation strategies for these risks involve building solid relationships with the participants at the onset; dedicating long-term observation that enables checking and confirming the observations and inferences; conducting intensive interviews that allow the collection of rich data varied enough to provide a complete picture of what is going on;  finally, the researcher needs to solicit feedback about the data collected from the participants, argued Maxwell (2013). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 38 Limitations This study has limitations due to its reliance on a single case study, limited resources such as the sample size being too small to generalize, the number of participants to interview, and the scope of the research. These limitations carry risks that could decrease the level of confidence or invalidate the research findings. However, the sample size depends on whether the sample is from a homogeneous or a heterogeneous population and the breadth and scope of research questions, argued Sebele-Mpofu (2020). One strategy for mitigating the small-size effect in qualitative research includes using saturation to enhance rigor and validity and improve quality and credibility, according to Sebele-Mpofu. Saturation is a paradoxical concept because of the complication of measuring saturation, whether one uses codes, themes, or meanings. According to Malterud et al. (2016), researchers must consider \"information power\" when selecting the participants and sample sizes to avoid duplicating what is already known. Information power is built on the aim of the study, the sample size specificity, the use of well-established theories, quality of dialogue, and analysis strategy, argued Malterud et al. The information size indicates that the more information the sample holds, the lower the number of participants needed, and this is what this one case study faced. The number of participants was small and constrained to one organization. Moreover, Maxwell (2013) asserts that developing concept maps aids the researcher in seeing the implications of the theory, its limitations, relevance, unexpected connections, identifying holes or contradictions in the study, and figuring out ways to resolve them. The risks associated with this case study of strategies for managing diversity included getting access to a site willing to participate in the research and the small sample size of single-case research. Providing access to organizational data to investigate diversity management remains a risk. Still, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 39 the outcomes of gaining deeper insight into the situation and its consequences on organizations' competitiveness outweigh the risk. The anticipated complaints could emanate from the majority group's feeling of being discriminated against on the basis of diversity management in the workplace. (Oswick & Noon, 2014) argued that leaders' inclusiveness revolves around maximizing gains from diversity and nurturing a culture of cohesion, collaboration, and cooperation where anti-discriminatory acts are work principles. (Coombs & Raycheba, 2001) claimed that employees must acknowledge that a poorly managed diverse workforce creates a toxic environment that affects all workers. Organizations must find solutions to alleviate the pain, confusion, and anxiety resulting from such an environment. Therefore, the limitations of this study should not sway organizations away from participating in the research and acquiring knowledge about the management of diversity that could enable them to create an inclusive environment that fosters employee creativity in the workplace. Delimitations This research study was delimited to focus on a purposeful sample of professionals and leaders in the information technology industry and may not be transferable. The researcher also considered the delimitation of the study theory by firm size as a moderating factor and investigated potential biases due to the topic's sensitivity (Schubert & Tavassoli, 2020). The access conditions could also delimit the study because of its sensitivity, the scope and boundaries set by gatekeepers, least disruption to organizational activities while the study is going on (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Gatekeepers can make or break the study process because they have the authority to make decisions by granting permission for mobility or withholding it, argued Erickson (1976). The researcher remained sensitive to such issues and dealt with them as they appeared. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 40 Significance of the Study Since the beginning of the 21st century, organizations have gone to great lengths to prepare for managing a diverse workforce for organizational effectiveness and productivity, according to Riccucci (2018). Research shows that a diverse and inclusive climate can improve job satisfaction and performance by ensuring that different perspectives and experiences are brought and fostered in organizations to address and respond to organizational challenges associated with globalization and a changing business environment, notes Riccucci. In today's global business environment, there are significant proactive measures to promote and manage diversity; however, past and present discrimination practices based on race, gender, and disability are still overt and covert in the workplace, argued Riccucci. This study explored the intersections of conceptual theories based on integration and learning, inclusive climate, social leadership, and awakening leadership theories and tried to answer organizations' many questions about effectively managing diversity in the workplace. This study dug deeper into the leadership development theory in this modern era. It brought a new framework for managing diversity that corresponds and aligns with what is happening with globalization and the ever-changing demographics of the current workforce. The findings of this research would undoubtedly contribute to the literature and help managers and practitioners in the business community and academia rethink their diversity management strategies to foster a team-inclusive climate and employee-inclusive behavior. Improving Leadership Practice The decisions made by top management and how those decisions affect their relationships with others; how integration and learning approaches to diversity are related to corporate ethical values; how an inclusive climate can mitigate the negative relationship between members, and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 41 how it complements the management of diversity in the workplace; how social leadership is going to change the landscape of leadership and management,  drove this study to fill the gaps or add to the understanding of the effective practices of managing diversity in the workplace. According to Jain et al. (2021), women still face barriers to recruitment and compensation parity on corporate boards; the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that women earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts (BLS, 2018). A recent 3-year study from Roepe (2018) found that women under 40 see this gap in compensation widen from 82 to 79 cents. What is arguably missing from the gender parity in the literature is the explicit focus on the impact of ownership in responding to organizational pressures (Klettner et al., 2016; Lyngsie & Foss, 2017; Perryman et al., 2016). According to Jain et al., these gaps in the literature illustrate the need to adopt gender equity strategies and practices and offer guidance in improving gender representation and mitigating gender compensation gaps in top management.  The concept of inclusive leadership expresses the need to ensure the participation of underprivileged people in developing processes proactively, Wuffli (2016). Inclusion fosters belongingness and connections, critical workplace attributes not achieved due to leaders who inhibit inclusion through their behaviors (Coleman III, 2017). Inclusive leadership seeks to address the relationship gap between leaders and their followers. (Fujimoto & H€artel, 2017) conceptualized an organizational diversity learning framework and found shortcomings in diversity training programs that provide an inclusive diversity learning program in which learning rests on the learner's experience. They found that the gap and the tension between demographic representations in the upper and lower echelons are widening and require a new learning framework to move beyond diversity training programs by including employees with different statuses, functions, and identities and inviting minority perspectives in the decision-STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 42 making process. This study addressed the issues of managing diversity by guiding organizational leadership to take responsibility the ownership of their actions in the management of diversity, for managers and organizations are being reminded that organizations' stakeholders are diverse and expect organizational decisions and actions to reflect those they serve (Jones & George, 2021). Organizations must embrace diversity by fostering an inclusive climate to moderate relationships, awaking their leaders, training them to become social leaders of the future that define how people think about leadership, building communities to unleash creativity and innovation in a connected world, and treating their employees with fairness and respect, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, backgrounds, and cultural differences. Implications for Biblical Integration According to (Ewest & Weeks, 2018), leadership is a gift given to humans, a spiritual gift or ability to carry out God's plan on earth. Paul said, \"And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let each exercise them accordingly --- he who leads, with diligence ---\" (King James Bible, 1769/2017, Romans 12:6, 8). This study looked at the leadership gift given to those who manage a diverse workforce to engage inclusive leadership by showing consideration, acceptance, and concern for the needs of their followers. This type of leadership also calls for a \"servant\" approach and is service-oriented; being a servant of the people is what authentic leadership is about.  Both secular and religious leadership require a conviction that the leader is authentic and can serve the followers' interests for the common good (Ewest & Weeks, 2018). The leadership style that appears to capture this well in secular leadership is transformational leadership, which shares characteristics with Christian leadership that has its basis in the person of Jesus Christ, expressed through life, works, teaching, and the Words of God. Managing diversity in the workplace would STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 43 follow the same path. According to Ewest and Weeks, Christian leaders are engaged leaders who lead from the heart; they have a vision that involves leaders and followers having a shared vision about internal life, bliss, joy, happiness, and characteristics of eternal life; this leadership embraces diversity - color, language, race, cultural and background differences. According to Merida (2015), biblical leaders have a calling and godly character; leadership is not about giftedness as much as it is about Christlikeness; when appointing people to a leadership position, stock must be put into their true character than their ability, or traits (King James Bible, 1769/2017, 1 Timothy 3:1-7).      Religious rhetoric serves humanity in several ways by reinforcing racial aspiration, communicating moral expectations and norms, exposing intellectual and cultural expression, and fighting social evil, according to Dyson (2021). In a world of complexity, diversity, and increased demand for purpose, organizations need future-oriented leaders with an authenticity born from identity with sincerity that promises a deep, genuine, trusting connection to inspire the future (Ewest & Weeks, 2018). Gemechu (2018) explores the contributing factors to the making of organizational leaders by focusing on historical leaders for the social, spiritual, and political arena in the persons of Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, and William Carey and found that the making of leaders is a calling for solving problems, commitment to causes beyond self, servant attitudes and hardworking behaviors. (King James Bible, 1769/2017, Colossians 3:23) says, \"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not men.\" Managing diversity effectively and ethically is work done from the heart. Still, it is easy to turn away from disaster when it affects others, but only for a limited time because, in the end, everyone is touched (Coombs & Raycheba, 2001, p. 130). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 44 Relationship to the Leadership Practices This study is related to business practices in a secular and religious aspect. Practical strategies for managing diversity in the 21st-century workplace benefit organizations and their employees. With globalization characterized by interconnectivity and interdependence, the modernization of business practice contributes to the growing importance of ethnicity and the increased significance of diversity in the workforce, posit Ana Suzete et al., 2021. Strategic leadership in managing a diverse workforce involves reducing the gender gaps and equity, representation, and compensation in top management; focusing on the training of leaders who value self-awareness and transparency in their relationships with others; leadership that fosters an inclusive climate (Ana Suzete et al., 2021; Georgiadou et al., 2019; Jain et al., 2021).  In this social age, the commercial Internet comes into existence, and a new world is born; the work defined by planning for foreseeable trends and competitors has been replaced by the social age, which requires a social leader in the business world in which constant disruption, agility and competing points of view are the rules (Guglielmo & Palsule, 2016). This study examined how integration and learning approaches to diversity and inclusive climate mitigate relationships between team members and how social leadership can help organizations and their leaders deal with a changing global business environment in which managing a diverse workforce has become the norm. Moreover, as businesses have gone global, it is less easy to see how scriptural ideas for holistic business are put into practice by evoking the value creation for a sustainable and profitable business with references to money and wealth in the Scripture that says that God gives the ability to produce wealth and also caution against greed (Bamber & Borchers, 2020), to provide economic opportunity and more profound meaning and to also care for people, argue Bamber and Borchers. In application to the Golden Rule, Jesus restates (King STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 45 James Bible, 1769/2017, Leviticus 19:18) in the New Testament: \"Do to others as you would have them do to you.\" \"love your neighbors as yourself\" (King James Bible, 1769/2017, Mark 12:31). Bamber and Borchers propose companies consider the above rules for dealing with customers, employees, and stakeholders. With deliberate misinformation, civil unrest resulting from incidents of racial injustice has created anxiety and uncertainty and makes people long for bona fide leadership they can trust, for honest and good leaders (MacArthur, 2006; Northouse, 2018). Summary of the Significance of the Study. This study examined strategic leadership's impacts on managing diversity through the lenses of integration and learning, awakening leadership, inclusive climate, and social leadership. Research confirms that organizational integration and learning perceptions moderate corporate ethical virtue, and leadership focusing on tasks and people is no longer acceptable. Organizations must embrace inclusiveness, acceptance, and mutual respect and understand various cultures and work ethics that can be conveyed through awakening leadership. Through inclusiveness, organizations can promote and reduce discriminatory tendencies toward marginalized groups and build team confidence while mitigating the negative relationship that can emerge through cross-national teams. Social leadership is the new discourse in the business milieu. It is a leadership style in which everyone and everything is connected, and communities are built to unleash creativity and innovation. This leadership style redefines how people think and engage one another. Today's social systems have changed consumers to prosumers that seek goods and services created for them. Researchers found that managing diversity in the workplace improves job satisfaction and organizations' effectiveness when the climate is inclusive. When diversity creates conflicts, an inclusive environment can be a mitigating strategy. This study would fill the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 46 gender, compensation, and representation gaps for women and disadvantaged groups or add to the literature on managing diversity practices; it highlighted the impact of ownership in responding to issues related to improving organizational practices concerning diversity management. The implications of biblical integration in business practices for leaders through humble, self-giving leadership were also examined. A Review of the Professional and Academic Literature This study reviewed the literature's main elements that outline leadership practices for effectively managing workplace diversity. These include practical strategies for managing diversity in the 21st-century workplace. The study gathered related studies from the literature for managing diversity and looked at the relationships between the concepts, theories, and constructs that represent the foundation of this case research. Following the description of the problem, the concepts concerning managing diversity are evaluated first, including moral values and ethics that can influence diversity; the importance of cultural competencies required to enhance awareness, the positive effect of diversity in stimulating innovation; how diversity practices in organizations can promote trust in leadership; how leadership behaviors positively or negatively affect diversity in the workplace; how globalization transforms business reality.  Leadership Practices Diversity and inclusion have roots in a social agenda advocating the rights and acceptance of racial or groups that have faced marginalization; research on diversity in organizations tends to tie diversity of groups to innovation and more challenging group processes (Burns & Ulrich, 2016). A study on effective leadership and talent practices found that commitment to diversity differentiates companies that build talent and perform efficiently from those that do not. These findings suggest the benefits of effectively managing diversity to improve employer brand, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 47 access to talent pools, firm reputation, and better decision-making (Burns & Ulrich, 2016; Garr et al., 2014). Organizations recognize that leaders who can bring diverse perspectives to decision-making can help their organizations avoid costly mistakes and identify opportunities with a pool of talents from different industries and geographic regions to harvest diverse perspectives, note Burns and Ulrich. For example, including different perspectives in decision-making from a diverse workforce would prevent Ford from naming a car \"Nova\" meaning “not Going” in Mexico; UPS from using brown trucks associated with hearses in Spain, and brown shirts with Adolf Hitler's Nazi party in Germany; with more excellent representation on their European expansion strategies, these companies could have avoided those brandings, posit Burns and Ulrich. Studies drawn from organizational development and human resource management (HRM) theories show that leadership is essential for fostering inclusiveness in the workplace (Andrews & Ashworth, 2015; Ashikali & Groeneveld, 2015; Bae et al., 2017; Brimhall, 2019; Sabharwal et al., 2018). Supportive leadership enables inclusiveness in organizations and teams, according to (Bae et al., 2017; Paustian-Underdahl et al., 2017; Randel et al., 2018; Ritz & Alfes, 2018). When intel committed to creating an inclusive and diverse workforce following the announcement of their CEO Brian Krzanick, it showed how executive sponsorship commitment to diversity and strategic practices could make a difference in managing diversity in organizations because, after one year, Intel reported a 30 percent increase in the under-represented minority, and 43.3 percent of new hires being female or from marginalized groups, which highlights the practices that differentiate top companies, argued Dickey (2016). According to Dickey, leaders' commitment to actively building a diverse leadership pipeline will benefit their businesses with consistent leadership participation and the involvement of senior leaders in STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 48 sponsoring and advocating for diversity that differentiates top companies from others. With leadership ownership and support for diversity at the top of the organizational hierarchy, businesses report fewer obstacles, such as lack of diversity awareness, hiring not focused on diversity, and organizational structure to support differences in the workforce, claim Burns and Ulrich (2016). Data from research show a shift of diversity from being an agenda for social justice to a business agenda of divergent vs. convergent thinking; divergent thinking creates novel ideas, whereas convergent thinking derives the single best idea, and organizations succeed by managing the paradox between divergent and convergent thinking, note Burns and Ulrich (2016). Too much convergent thinking leads to groupthink. A gap exists in diversity management research when the methodology measures employee perceptions of diversity management activities and ignores the other side of diversity management that looks at the leadership behaviors that affect diversity management, argued Kulik (2014). The concept of diversity management has become a strategy for several organizations due to globalization, the migration of people across the world, and a labor market with the participation of minority groups (Al Ariss & Sidani, 2016; Ashikali et al., 2021). This concept of strategizing the management of diversity creates an opportunity for organizations to improve interactions with a diverse workforce to improve outcomes for those left behind and to gain legitimacy, argued Ashikali et al. The Problem To date, there is no singular conceptualization of organizational diversity management practices, and most implementations of diversity management practices fail (Dwertmann et al., 2016; Konrad et al., 2016; Kulik, 2014). According to (Dobbin & Kalev, 2016), organizations STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 49 have been trying to reduce bias with the same practices used since the 1960s but seldom change attitudes, let alone behaviors. According to the authors, behavioral design can prevent biased choices, change people's beliefs, and break the link between gut reactions and actions. Knowledge, experience, values, motives, and biases of top managers influence which information is salient, how information is shared, and how information gaps are processed because the cognitions and values of organizations' executives reflect the strategic decisions and their outcomes (Finkelstein et al., 2009; Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Behavioral cultural intelligence, the ability to incorporate cultural knowledge into behaviors and actions, and how leaders draw from this knowledge demonstrates their artistic capability for understanding cultural differences and the characteristics associated with diversity management or their attitudes towards diversity (Schölmerich et al., 2016; Turner & Merriman, 2021). At the Houston CIO Executive Leadership Summit (2020), executive leaders examine pressing leadership strategy issues, including increased attention to technology, diversity and inclusion programs, and actionable steps to strengthen innovation efforts. According to the President and CEO of Hunter Muller Global's (HMG) strategy, Savvy executives recognize the importance of embracing diversity and inclusion in their organizations to gain from diverse backgrounds and perspectives for problem-solving and innovation. In higher education, Georgiadou et al. (2019) found that the primary limit to equality of opportunity for students is the persistence of differences between families in the economic, social, and cultural resources, and policy can partly compensate for economic differences. Georgiadou et al. (2019) also observe that students from advantaged social groups enjoy more access to elite universities through the influence of policies, and disadvantaged students are excluded. The study suggests STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 50 that recruitment in elite universities should include students from diverse backgrounds and minority groups by integrating diversity management with their admission policies. The research found that companies tend to fill their talent needs from a diverse workforce and spend a lot of money on diversity training which shows mixed evidence of effectiveness but overlooks retention and advancement, Te-Ping (2020). Companies are not spending money on the activities such as longer-term diversity programs focused on retaining and advancing their most talented employees, says Ron Williams, the Black former CEO of Aetna, reports Te-Ping. Furthermore, (Fuhrmans & Te-Ping, 2021) agreed that diversity could fuel innovation in a fast-changing environment where technology disrupts the norm. A diverse team supported by inclusiveness outperforms a homogenous group. They also found that having diversity in the highest executive roles is crucial to company success. The general problem to be addressed is the lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity in organizations, resulting in the inability of organizations to make strategic changes to gain a competitive advantage in the era of rapidly shifting demographics. Riccucci (2018) found that the American workforce has changed from a decade ago because today, women, people of color, immigrants, baby boomers, and millenniums are working side-by-side. Bringing a team combined with different capabilities from men, women, and people of all cultural heritage and generations, according to (Bourke & Espedido, 2019), does not guarantee high performance, but inclusive leadership does. (Choi et al., 2018; Sidhu et al., 2020) observed that the problem of effectively managing diversity in organizations derives from the rarity of women and minorities in leadership positions; increasing their representation in higher positions leads to improvement and integrity.  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 51 The specific problem to be addressed is the failure to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity within a West African organization, resulting in decreased workers’ job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities in senior leadership positions. The following paragraphs describe the concepts, theories, and constructs related to this study. The research concepts are reviewed below, starting with how moral values and ethics influence diversity. Also, throughout the text, rival evidence was provided about how diversity can negatively affect organizational performance and employees’ perceptions. According to several studies, diversity decreases social integration and team cohesion and increases conflicts (Milliken & Martins, 1996; Williams & O’Reilly, 1998). However, according to (Dongrey & Rokade, 2021), employees are likely to disengage from task performance when they feel equal in career development and representation in the workplace. It is a known fact that individuals interpret diversity based on their social identity or groups. Still, when employees perceive differences and equality based on diversity traits, which could affect them psychologically, their performance can be affected positively and negatively, according to Dongrey and Rokade. Concepts Moral Values and Ethics Influence Diversity According to Engelbrecht et al. (2018), ethical leaders are responsible for demonstrating moral values, integrity, and true altruistic motivation that play an essential role in justice experienced by employees. When leaders espouse higher moral values, they display more remarkable pro-diversity behavior. Their words and actions become imperative but are not sufficient alone for implementing diversity management practices; HR managers must view their leaders as being committed to workplace diversity for diversity management to be implemented STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 52 (Ng & Sears, 2020). Studies found that moral values moderate the relationship between diversity beliefs and behaviors and influence pro-diversity behavior when leaders' views are positive, Ng and Sears. According to Ünsür (2019), how one internalizes moral values and principles is based on one's virtuous personality and the determination with which one applies them. Management based on ethical values creates loyalty, belief, trust, enthusiasm, happiness, and excitement in organizations, argued Ünsür. HR leaders must follow the laws and moral values within the scope of their organizational strategic objectives in meeting the needs of their employees by effectively creating awareness of authority and responsibilities to a management style that incorporates moral values that need to be observed. These values include good intention, honesty, justice, abiding by one's word, tolerance, straightforwardness, trust, and responsibility (Mondy, 2017, p. 4; Ünsür (2019). In summary, ethical leaders' moral values in the workplace can be crucial in promoting and implementing diversity management. Next, the study examined how cultural competencies can enhance awareness.  Cultural Competencies Enhance Awareness As the workforce in the 21st century becomes increasingly diverse and multicultural, it becomes essential for organizational leaders to consider cultural competencies to prepare their organizations to effectively engage, represent, and better serve their employees and the people in their communities (Weimer & Zemrani, 2017). To overcome cultural deficiency, organizations must first assess the organizational cultural competencies, especially when working with culturally diverse clients. Second, evaluate the environment for cultural competency indicators, argued Weimer and Zemrani. According to the authors, cultural competencies have three components: awareness, knowledge, and skills. Awareness is the most important because a person must be aware of their cultural background and experiences, which influence their STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 53 attitudes, values, and biases; knowledge of culture is also essential for understanding diverse ethnic and cultural groups; the skills component of cultural competency refers to cross-cultural and intergroup behavioral and task competencies. According to Carrizales (2019), cultural competency practice in organizations has been around for a while but is more prevalent now than ever because of globalization and diversity in the workforce. Cultural competency in organizations is a means to achieve service effectiveness and beneficial outcomes by valuing diversity, posits Carrizales. It builds upon ongoing learning and engaging with different individual populations and is characterized as a progression from cultural awareness toward cultural competency, remarks Carrizales. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) has published standards specific to cultural competency (NASW 2017) relevant to public and private organizations and provides additional means for professional accountability that underscores social equity in managing diversity, notes Carrizales. Below, the researcher investigated how diversity can stimulate innovation in the workplace.  Diversity Stimulates Innovation  With businesses becoming globalized due to migration and an increasingly diverse workforce, organizations struggle to recruit the talents they need to increase customer service and satisfaction and higher innovation in their operations and competitive advantage (Yadav & Lenka, 2020). The increase of workforces in terms of ethnic minorities, gender, and people from all over the globe has resulted in a wide range of cultures, knowledge, and skills that have also increased innovation and creativity in organizations, posit Yadav and Lenka. However, there are challenges with a diverse workforce that can have a negative impact on organizational performance, according to the authors. They found that diversity and differences within teams can lead to poor communication, increased conflicts, and high turnover: Similarity-attraction STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 54 theory and social identity theory in the literature support this negative effect of diversity in the workplace. People are more productive and less combative in groups with similar members. If implemented effectively, Yadav and Lenka suggest that diversity management can help organizations identify the root cause of many challenges. Nevertheless, studies confirm that innovation and information technology (IT) affect firm performance and increase diversity and IT competence determinants of innovation. Moreover, Feintzeig (2020) demonstrated that fostering diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace boosts companies' financial, advertising, and innovation performance. Following this, the researcher explored how diversity practices can promote trust in leadership. Diversity Practices Promote Trust in Leadership Workplace trust is a well-known fact in organizations. It is believed that trust in leadership mediates between HR diversity management and knowledge sharing and moderates the relationship of trust in leadership (Raza & Sikandar, 2018). Organizations are encouraged to develop a learning environment for sharing their knowledge and trust their leadership to facilitate organizational productivity and performance, posit Raza and Sikandar. These researchers also found that when employees trust their leadership, they can develop their capabilities and start trusting their coworkers. Trust is shown to mediate the effects of a perceived diversity climate on members feeling of inclusion (Hofhuis et al., 2016; Raza & Sikandar, 2018). Studies show that communication between diverse team members plays an essential role in trust and openness in the workplace because when the climate reflects a positive view on diversity, team members report better performance, according to Hofhuis et al. (2016). Research also shows that trust in leaders can link ethical leadership to safety and compliance. Evidence shows that subordinates' perceptions of ethical leadership promote trust-based relationships between leaders and their STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 55 associates, posit Enwereuzor et al. (2020). An ethical leader is defined as someone who exhibits ethical behavior in words and deeds, a moral person with integrity and trustworthiness that shows in their professional and personal life, according to Enwereuzor et al. (2020). Based on the social exchange theory tenets, ethical leaders elicit trust in their followers by creating an organizational climate that promotes employee reciprocity in positive work behavior (Brown et al., 2005). Ethical leadership, therefore, is an approach that can improve workplace diversity; however, further studies are needed in this domain for more evidence. According to Bedi et al. (2015), ethical leaders influence employees' work-related outcomes through social exchange because when subordinates perceive their leaders to treat them fairly, they tend to see such a leader as trustworthy and have a sense of obligation to engage in positive workplace behavior. Following the study investigated in detail how leadership behaviors can positively or negatively affect diversity. Leadership Behaviors Positively or Negatively Affect Diversity In their research, Basker et al. (2020) found that employees and managers must undergo changes concerning leadership behaviors of consideration within the workplace in promoting opportunities and subordinates' affective commitment that might also be related to individual ethical behavior in the context of a culturally diverse workforce (Presbitero & Teng-Calleja, 2019). According to Presbitero and Teng-Calleja, studies establish a link between perceived ethical leadership and members' behaviors. (Mo & Shi, 2018) demonstrate a link between ethical leadership and team task performance. Similarly, with the ever-increasing globalization and workforce diversity, an ethical leadership behavior that promotes diversity management is necessary for cultural values frameworks that adequately equip workers to operate in a safe and enjoyable working environment (Azevedo & Shane, 2019). Overall, task and relational STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 56 leadership behaviors can positively or negatively impact firm activities, including managing a diverse workforce, Hartnell et al. (2016).  Positive leadership behaviors are associated with charismatic and ethical leadership, and both moderate relationships between employee diversity and promote the development of trust based-relationships, according to Enwereuzor et al. (2020). Positive leaders' behaviors, according to research, can foster and curb uncivil behaviors, such as interpersonal mistreatments that violate norms for mutual respect and demeaning remarks in the workplace, Walsh et al. (2018). Research from (Çayak & Eskici, 2021) also found that emotional intelligence plays a mediating role in the relationship between school leadership behaviors and their ability to manage differences, according to teacher perceptions and correlation analysis, which found there is a positive and significant relationship between leadership sustainable leadership behaviors and management skills required for leading a diverse workforce. In completing this section about the concepts mentioned in this study, the research examined how globalization can transform business reality. Globalization Transforms Business Reality Globalization has indeed transformed businesses around the globe, and these changes can be witnessed in private and public organizations, and academic institutions, Leišytė et al. (2021). Exclusion and inclusion in the globalization of genomics in rare genetic diseases in Brazil and Africa show how globalization can negatively affect certain groups because of their ethnicities and identities (Gibbon & Aureliano, 2018). The authors offer examples of thinking and measuring inclusion and point out the importance of understanding the challenges of achieving equality and inclusion in universities through cross-country comparisons of various aspects of diversity and inclusivity. The social inclusion focusing on universities and higher education STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 57 systems explores how these systems succeed or fail to become inclusive and the policies and processes that can help them achieve their goals to engage academics and students to become agents of change through inclusive teaching and research cultures, Leišytė et al.   According to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, there are increasing inequalities in universities and digitalization worldwide, Lamont et al. (2016). There is a bit of in-depth investigation about the inclusive university where diversity is supported without discrimination or stigmatization that enables opportunities for all, posit Leišytė et al. (2021). Within the context of the globalization of genetic research, the focus on rare genetic diseases is becoming prominent (Gibbon & Aureliano, 2018). It is subject to the dynamics of inclusion or exclusion as a concern of participation in research and access to health care. By drawing attention to the contrasting movements in the dynamics between inclusion and exclusion in genetics treatment, Gibbon and Aureliano have shown how rare disease in the globalization of genomic medicine is locally constituted with slippery boundaries between research and rights to health therapy and prevention. Due to globalization, high people movement, the labor market participation of minorities, and the workforce in organizations have become increasingly diverse. This diverse workforce creates opportunities for public organizations to improve their interactions with citizens, improve bureaucratic outcomes for disadvantaged groups, and gain legitimacy, Ashikali et al. (2021). Workforce diversity may not only contribute to responsiveness, innovation, and effectiveness, but it may also induce team conflict and decrease group cohesion, which, in turn, may result in deteriorating organizational performance, according to Ashikali et al. Next, the above theories are reviewed, starting with servant leadership and other leadership styles. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 58 Workforce diversity and globalization will be the management topics of the next decade; however, organizations have not fully explored the impact of these changing demographics in the workplace, Tsui et al. (1992). (Wharton & Baron, 1987) investigated gender desegregation in men. They found that men in a predominantly diverse work environment have lower job-related satisfaction, self-esteem, and job-related depression than men- or female-dominated settings. Both Tsui et al. (1992) and Wharton and Baron studies were conducted in the early 90s. Still, today in the 21st century, evidence from the literature shows that inclusion and diversity in the workplace, if managed effectively, can be beneficial for tasks requiring creativity and innovation. Globalization and the many opportunities provided by technology have changed the business landscape. This ever-changing landscape is driven by immigration, ease of border crossing, and international corporations conducting business worldwide, which lead to a diverse workforce in all organizations, small or big. Research consistently has shown that individuals interact more often with members of their social groups than with members of other groups, Stephan (1978). Researchers also found that homogeneous groups are more likely to be socially integrated and experience higher satisfaction and lower turnover than heterogeneous groups; they also outperform heterogeneous groups (O'Reilly et al., 1989; Fenelon & Megargee, 1971; Clement & Schiereck, 1973; Jackson et al., 1991). Therefore, understanding the effect of demographic characteristics in the workplace is essential (Pfeffer, 1983; Thomas, 1990). As one can notice, these studies are all from the 80s and 90s; Now, things have drastically changed in this global business environment in which a diverse workforce has become a reality, and workers are more culturally conscious than decades ago. A rapidly changing world characterizes today's business environment, and rules and routines derived from a hierarchy are no longer feasible and will not enable agility (Burns & Ulrich, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 59 2016). According to the authors, adaptation to change occurs through tension, not routines, because tension comes when differences are acknowledged, accepted, and debated. When diversity enhances divergent/convergent thinking in the decision-making process, it leads to positive tension that allows organizations to adapt and diversity to pivot from a social to a business agenda, argued Burns and Ulrich. Diversity enhances better organizational decision-making with rotation programs that help leaders build diverse views by rotating employees through different units to enable them to achieve unit goals together. According to Burns and Ulrich, this concept can be taken further by rotating new hires through different geographic areas or engaging in talent swaps with other organizations to help leaders get the mental models they need for understanding complex systems within a broader context that allows them to make better decisions. Exploring the relationship between construction workers' communication skills and productivity (Johari & Jha, 2021) found that multicultural workplaces can negatively influence workers' performance. They argued that when workers speak different languages and work on the same project, their communication is poor, decreasing employee performance. Theories Servant Leadership Gotsis and Grimani (2016, p. 985) explained servant leadership as a leadership style that might have an interest in nurturing inclusive climates. Servant leaders motivate and encourage equitable, socially responsible practices and interventions to decrease team tensions, promoting feelings of belongingness, Gotsis, and Grimani. According to Brohi et al. (2018), servant leadership contributes to organizational effectiveness and improves organizational commitment (Jang & Kandampully, 2018). Resane (2020) claimed that servant leadership's passion is to empower others to become wiser, more accessible, and healthier by focusing on people's growth STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 60 and well-being and their communities. Servant leaders have high self-esteem, have no problem listening to others they lead, and nurture them towards maturity and competency, argued Resane. They are the shepherds and send others to the front to take the lead in their area of expertise; it is a leadership sense of responsibility entrusted by God to brighten a better future for emerging leaders, posits Resane. Next, the impact of inclusive leadership in diversity management is explored.  Inclusive Leadership Employers have been implementing equal opportunity and affirmative action policies; however, workforce diversity can increase team conflict and decrease group cohesion. According to Ashikali et al. (2021), managing diversity is a complex process with multiple conflicting motives underlying diversity policies and management in organizations. Siemiatycki (2019) research highlighted male dominance and lack of racial diversity, with women and minority groups underrepresented in the top leadership roles in many organizations and industries. Achieving diversity in senior leadership roles of an organization is significant. Women and minority groups in top management roles serve as agents of change within their organizations to dismantle the gender-segregated organization, creating opportunities and empowering women leaders (Siemiatycki, 2019; Stainback et al., 2016, p. 127). First, the study reviewed the concepts related to managing diversity in the workplace mentioned in this case study. Then the exploration continues by examining charismatic leadership's effects on managing diversity. Charismatic leadership has been defined using many terms in the literature as a person with unique and extraordinary qualifications who emerges in a social crisis, offers radical solutions, and is believed by researchers to have special powers, Grabo et al. (2017). The many characteristics of charismatic leaders positively affect their employees, organizations, innovation, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 61 and performance, and they can cultivate different ideas for leading-edge activities, including diversity management (Adiguzel & Cakir, 2020). Diversity management issues constitute today a crucial plan for organizations and practitioners who want to benefit from the effective management of workforce diversity, resolve conflicts in harmony with organizational goals in mind, and decisively handle workforce with differing characteristics, posit Adiguzel and Cakir. For these reasons, it becomes strategically important for organizations to develop the efficiency and loyalty of their employees with leadership behaviors of a charismatic style to solve challenges that require urgent collective action from employees, Grabo et al. (2017). Historically charismatic characters were attributed to royalty or religious leaders who were believed to possess divinely granted gifts that enabled them to achieve exceptional feats, argue Grabo et al. But as populations continue to expand, charismatic leaders still show more strength. They are likely to neutralize the adverse effects of team diversity in the workplace, such as age diversity, on group outcomes (Seong & Hong, 2018). Transformational Leadership       When transformational leaders perceive their workforce as diverse, team cohesion and information elaboration are affected positively; their perception also stimulates a cognitive process, such as information elaboration, according to Ashikali et al. (2020).  Information elaboration enables diverse teams to transform their knowledge into actionable solutions to complex problems because cognitive ability allows teams with the \"can do\" ability and the \"will do\" motivation to engage in complex elaboration, and information processing efforts, Resick et al. (2014). Studies conducted by Turner and Merriman (2021) found that transformational leadership behaviors mediate the relationship between human resource leaders' cultural intelligence and organizational diversity management practices.  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 62      Similarly, Moon (2016) discovered that transformational leadership could be an inclusive leadership style that affects followers' organizational citizenship behavior by shaping their identities at the corporate level and recognizing individual needs through mentoring, feedback, and similar activities. Brown et al. (2019) examined the factors that impact the perceptions of diversity management programs and found that transformational leadership at the lower management level may influence such perceptions. Transformational leadership style is believed to correlate with the leader’s moral and ethical orientation and is more inclined to do what is morally right by protecting the rights and dignities of individuals (Aronson, 2001; Groves & LaRocca, 2010). This leadership style also underscores social justice more than procedure justice, posit Brown et al. Critical Race Theory  Discrimination in the workplace does not always fit into the categories of racism or sexism; it is a combination of both. To understand it, organizations need to apply the core principles of critical race theory (CRT). CRT is a framework used to examine culture related to race, law, and power notes Gordon (1999). CRT combines the issues of power, race, and racism to address color blindness and post-racial societies because ignoring racial differences perpetuates injustices to people of color; it also seeks to analyze experiences of racial minorities and the existing power system like white privilege and white supremacy, argued Boyd (2018). Grosser et al. (2017) studied how gender has been a salient concern to business ethicists and feminist scholars since the 1990s. They suggested how feminist scholarship relating to behavior through psychology, feminist organization studies, and economics through feminist economics could be integrated to strengthen business ethics and corporate social responsibility, gender relations, and equality. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 63 Feminism Theory Monticelli (2020) theorizes autonomy in the context of indigenous movements and struggles that entail awareness of the meaning of time, progress, and nature shaped by customs and traditions throughout history. She describes some well-known Latin American social movements and their mobilizations, such as the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, indigenous rallies against the privatization of water and oil in Bolivia, and the peasant-led movement in Brazil. Many gender equality policies have been adopted globally after the second wave of the Women's Movement, but these achievements are being contested by anti-feminist movements worldwide (Charles, 2020; Krizsan & Roggeband, 2018; Paternotte & Kuhar, 2018; Verloo & Paternotte, 2018). There is a need to acknowledge and unpack how gender can generate distinctive, albeit context-dependent, constraints, and opportunities in systemic transformations that shape particular socio-technical pathways (Wolfram & Kienesberger, 2023). Moreover, as illustrated by the Women's March or #Me Too movements, opposition to feminist knowledge production and reproductive rights prompted novel forms and scales of activism following the Covid-19 with known patterns of systemic gender inequality and injustice, such as gaps in healthcare, participation, leadership, payment (Allmendinger, 2021; WEF, 2021; Azcona et al., 2020; Ozkazanç-Pan & Pullen, 2020). A conceptual disengagement out of step with current high-level political commitments such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG5) or the EU gender equality strategy 2020–25, which advocate gender considerations be placed at the core of societal change.  This conceptual disengagement also fails to explore the diverse and complex de-/stabilizing roles gender may play in societal systems, and thus its genuine relevance for sustainability transitions, posit Wolfram and Kienesberger. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 64 Constructs  Top Executives can Promote Diversity      Liu et al. (2022) investigated top management team boundary-spanning leadership. They concluded that with advances in the digital economy, organizations worldwide need to stretch the boundaries of their leadership strategy and knowledge for competitive advantage and sustainability. Their findings demonstrate that leadership boundary-spanning promotes innovative employee behavior through a perceived motivational climate. Thus, spanning leadership roles to include women and minority is no exception. It will encourage an inclusion and motivation environment that empowers a diverse workforce. As participant 12 in this current study said, people have a sense of belonging and fitting everywhere they go because it is a longing for human instinct. Brown et al. (2019) confirmed the benefit of fostering an inclusive climate where employees feel fairly treated, valued, and included, an environment that maximizes the benefits of diversity.  Changes and transitions within the US military demonstrate leaders need to find ways to leverage demographics and functional diversity in their units to support their effectiveness, argued Brown et al.      A study by Lei et al. (2023) found that differences in the background characteristics of top firm executives can reduce management agency costs. Their findings are based on strategic theory and the assumption that leaders are rational economic decision-makers. (Hambrick & Mason, 1984) assumed that heterogeneity at the top management level, on gender, age, education, and working tenure, may lead to differences in managers' analysis of the business environment and resources. Thus, change at the top of organizational management can increase innovation based on background characteristics, perspectives, and skills knowledge. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 65 Organizational Moral Values Contribute to Workplace Happiness      Topino et al. (2022) investigated worker satisfaction and resilience relationships. Their findings showed a positive relationship between resilience and satisfaction moderated by career adaptability and self-efficacy. The construct of satisfaction with life is one's cognitive judgment and is associated with physical and psychological health (Tokay Argan & Mersin, 2021). Social responsibility (SR) is the concept organizations consider for the interest of society, including their employees, by taking responsible, ethical behaviors and actions with their activities, argued Bocean et al. (2022). Organizational ethics is a set of codes of principles and values that govern decisions and actions within an organization. Ethics has an internal perspective while SR has an external perspective, posit Bocean et al.      Martela (2023) said that making a positive contribution to benefiting others is a core dimension of meaningful work and should be recognized as a critical axiological values work can serve and a justification for why work is valuable and worth doing. The author argues that doing work with no positive impact or where one is separated from such an impact is a type of alienation. As participant 7 in this current study said, leaders must make their employees comfortable around one another and recognize everyone has their values and differences. If everyone respects one another, they all can contribute to one another culture without alienation. Recognizing people's interest in contributing and engaging in their work has an implication for the duties everyone has to ensure that work has a positive impact on all stakeholders, including society, organizations, and their employees. Therefore, Organizational Moral Values exhibited by their leadership Contribute to Workplace Happiness. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 66 Change at the top of Management can Produce Differences      Top-level managers play an essential role concerning corporate commitment to climate change issues that can stimulate the capabilities of organizational processes or other business operations by paying attention to the underlying business processes and making these capabilities focused, actionable, and contemporary, Albitar et al. (2023). The same is true concerning organizational management of diversity in the workplace. Executive management's commitment to diversity management in organizations can impact the developing and building of more diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations. Mattingly et al. (2022) assert that \"many organizations have lost ground due to complacency; even a simple change in leadership can shift an organization off its DEI course\" (p. 153).      The sad and disturbing reality in today's political and business environment is the concept of whiteness and white supremacy becoming central to discourse about race. Rather than embracing anti-racist work, the Department of Education actively excludes racial literacy from teaching education with new guidance, indicating their leniency to stay with the status quo and avoid change as long as possible. Moorosi (2021) suggests leaders are encouraged to approach school leadership as race-neutral leaders, with standards emphasizing ‘race’ as creating ‘difference rather than inequality’ (p. 644). DiAngelo (2022) called this concept White Fragility \"a concept that inspires White people to think about how white folk understand their whiteness and react defensively to being called to account for how that whiteness has gone under the radar of race for far too long\" (p. x). Ethnocentrism and Nationalism are Predictors of Exclusiveness      Arli et al. (2023) examined the phenomenon that influences the al and local identity of citizens of nations. They noticed that migration would continue to grow, and people's perceptions STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 67 of countries' images will e. They also remarked that this phenomenon affects narcissism, especially in managing workplace diversity (emphasis added). National identity or patriotism is a consequence of the live evaluation of one's group that imply different social goals but can be related to attitudes toward minorities (Blank & Schmidt, 2003). However, attitudes toward outgroups and minorities are to be distinguished from national identity, nationalism, and patriotism, posit Arli et al.      Cichocka et al. (2022) examined national narcissism, the belief that one's nation is undervalued, and is related to several social ills, such as conspiracy beliefs, intergroup aggressions, extremism, and behaviors. They found that individual narcissism, self-esteem, and right-wing political leniency positively predict higher national narcissism. Sociologists had paid little attention to the topic of upper-class exclusiveness that could reveal a complete picture of the American Stratification system, according to Moore (1962). The argument is that upper-class exclusiveness or selection reduces the talents recognized and rewarded in society, which is dysfunctional to the community, posits Moore. According to participant 9 of this current study, ethnocentrism would not allow diversity to flourish and can lead to stereotypes, misunderstanding, and spin preconceived negative feelings. Related Studies Employers have been implementing equal opportunity and affirmative action policies. From a management perspective, diversity is valued as a resource to inform work practices and policies (Groeneveld, 2015; Groeneveld & Van de Walle, 2010). However, workforce diversity can increase team conflict and decrease group cohesion. According to Ashikali et al., managing diversity is a complex process with multiple conflicting motives underlying organizational diversity policies and management. The corporate rationale reflects diversity motives for STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 68 increasing diversity in the workforce or paying attention to diversity (Ely & Thomas, 2001, as cited by Ashikali et al., 2021).  There are two paradigms for managing diversity, including the discrimination and fairness perspective, which focus on preventing adverse outcomes, and the synergy perspective, which focuses on realizing performance benefits, which combines two categories, access and legitimacy, and integration and learning, according to (Ely & Thomas, 2001, as cited by Ashikali et al., 2021). According to Beck, Jørgensen, and Bozeman (2007), the first category treats diversity as a resource to increase organizational legitimacy based on the representation bureaucracy theory. This motive allows organizations to represent disadvantaged groups by shaping policies to compensate for inequalities, argued Ashikali et al. The synergy perspective is associated with the integration and learning perspective, from which organizations view diversity as a way to improve creativity and innovation. While discrimination and fairness motives are based on moral and social justice, integration and learning motive refers solely to the business case of diversity (Selden & Selden, 2001).  These multiple motives represent a dilemma for organizations that base their HR policies and practices on gaining access and legitimacy, argue Ashikali et al. The difficulty is salient when the integration and learning perspective values social identity as a resource for learning and innovation. In contrast, the discrimination and fairness perspective devalues it because of potential injustice, posit Ashikali and colleagues. According to McDougall (1996), these perspectives are not mutually exclusive and might include conflicting values that could create tensions when both motives are present in diversity policies and management. The discrimination, fairness, and synergy perspectives can be compelling within an organization depending on the motives and goals when implementing diversity management (Dwertmann et STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 69 al., 2016; Selden & Selden, 2001). Conflicts between policies and business strategies can occur when they are based on discrimination and fairness that promotes affirmative action, argued Ashikali et al. (2021). Thus, guiding HR recruitment, selection, and promotion, and when integration and learning do not enable themselves through discrimination and fairness, contradict the goals of the access and legitimacy perspective. It becomes a dilemma when organizations have multiple motives based on HR policies and practices, argued Ashikali et al. Riccucci (2018, p. 192) argued that diversity management may only produce incremental progress if not well-managed by quoting the voting rights case, Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder, read from the bench. “Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and continues to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet” (p. 590). Research shows a diverse, inclusive climate can improve job satisfaction, motivation, and performance. It ensures different perspectives and experiences are brought in with a spectrum of visions available to address organizational problems and challenges, argued Riccucci (2018, p. 26). Page (2007) claims that progress and innovation depend on group diversity rather than lone thinkers with high IQs and that diversity trumps homogeneity. According to Riccucci (2018), diversity enhances organizational performance when contingent upon how diversity is managed. Diversity management strategies can break down social barriers between employees, promote inclusion, and ensure that diverse values are accepted. According to the implicit leadership theory (Subramaniam & Sambasivan, 2018), the common idea is that people have a schema regarding leadership. Ideal leaders are assumed to be competent, caring, honest, educated, and well-dressed, according to Carroll (2015). The difference between the ideal leader and the actual leader's behavior is known as a leadership STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 70 expectation gap, notes Carroll. Moreover, based on the similarity attraction paradigm, members of a leader-follower dyad who share similar demographic characteristics are likely to have a positive relationship, according to Randolph-Seng et al. (2016).  A high level of leadership member exchange (LMX) characterizes a high level of interaction; in contrast, low-quality LMX dyads will experience low relationships between leaders and followers. According to Subramaniam and Sambasivan (2018), this leadership expectation gap negatively affects the quality of the connections and hampers workplace diversity management. According to (Bass & Bass, 2008), leadership is a complex process that has invaded humans' daily lives in schools, businesses, social groups, religious organizations, and public agencies. Still, leadership can be good because it makes a difference. Bass and Bass argue that leadership is built into the human psyche because of the extended period humans need to be nurtured by parents for survival. With the rise of civilization, societies created theories for an acceptable explanation for leaders' dominance and subordinates' submission. Those days are long gone; leadership is not what you do to people but what you do with people (Blanchard & Broadwell, 2018). Globalization and the many opportunities provided by technology have changed the business landscape. This ever-changing landscape is driven by immigration, ease of border crossing, and international corporations conducting business worldwide, which lead to a diverse workforce in all organizations, small or big. Joniaková et al. (2021) conducted a study to examine the relationship between workforce diversity and organizational performance in education at Northern Cyprus universities. Their findings show that diversity fatigue can suppress the relationship between the two. They defined diversity fatigue as when barriers confront the implementation of diversity in organizations or when the support of senior leaders is absent, making employees and students resent a sense of STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 71 distrust, weariness, and questioning. In return, these barriers and lack of support can damage the organization's productivity and impact staff morale, argue Joniaková et al. (2021). Based on the authors' argument in their study, the negative effect of diversity in the workplace is a lack of leadership to implement and effectively manage diversity instead of having a diverse workforce. (Bishu & Kennedy, 2019; Feeney & Camarena, 2019) examined the role of inclusive leadership and how such leadership style supports an inclusive climate by fostering interactions between team members instead of focusing on the leadership-follower exchange behavior (Knies et al., 2016; Ospina, 2017). According to Shore, two dimensions are not captured in the inclusive climate paradigm: the integration of differences and the inclusion of differences in decision-making. According to (Shore et al., 2011), these two dimensions are not captured in belongingness and uniqueness but refer to the dimension of the team climate. In the integration of differences, the norms and expectations of being open to differences are valued, and members can enact their social identities even if they differ from majority groups (Dwertmann & Boehm, 2016; Dwertmann et al., 2016; Nishii, 2013). The inclusion of differences in decision-making involves seeking different ideas and perspectives from team members because their contributions enhance work practices. Both the integration and inclusion of differences can sustain an environment where individuals feel belonging and uniqueness. Researchers found two factors to improve productivity in this global business environment: inclusive group attitudes in the team and exemplary leadership that promotes diversity (Lauring & Jonasson, 2018). Bushe and Marshak (2016) found that inclusive leadership broods a mindset that encourages innovative ideas and possibilities fostered by different narratives and meanings that challenge the status quo. This leadership style focuses on creating an environment that unleashes the energy and ideas latent in the organization so that emergent processes serve the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 72 organization. The leaders, along with others, monitor the processes, results, and experiments, and those that show promise are nurtured and allocated resources, argued Bushe and Marshak. Because of the workforce's complexity, uncertainty, and diversity, leaders cannot successfully manage with a performance mindset that emphasizes facts, figures, and best practices for specific targets, note (Bushe and Marshak). Instead, they must recognize that meeting performance targets produces a narrow, short-term perspective and reliance on what was successful in the past, according to Bushe and Marshak. Diversity attributes, whether visible or less visible, play a role in teams and can affect intergroup relations that could create fault lines with other socially constructed identities based on status differences and beliefs, traditions, norms, or values that could elicit salient categorizations (Breslin et al., 2017; Ospina & Foldy, 2009).  However, according to the authors, such inclusive attitudes that allow individuals to work as a team will be less attainable when workgroups are highly culturally and linguistically diverse because of negative emotions. A study conducted by Ashikali et al. (2020) in Dutch public organizations found a negative relation between team ethnic and cultural diversity and inclusive climate; however, they also found that inclusive leadership can mitigate the negative impact of high team ethnic and cultural diversity and inclusiveness. To understand inclusion climate, (Mor Barak et al., 2016; Van Knippenberg & Van Ginkel, 2010) examine two diversity perspectives: the information decision-making perspective and the social identity-categorization perspective. They found that team diversity can be explained by the information decision-making perspective that involves exchanging and discussing different ideas and views on problem-solving.  When team members adopt the information decision-making perspective, their unique characteristics are valued, which could lead to a feeling of belongingness and uniqueness, leading to a positive link between the representation of ethnic and cultural groups in STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 73 organizations and their sense of inclusion (Andrews & Ashworth, 2015). However, according to Mor Barak et al. (1998), belongingness can affect the interactions with members of that group and are expected to be more fruitful than with those considered dissimilar; this tendency of similarities and differences of group members could result in excluding other groups because these intergroup biases can undermine the social integration of diverse teams (Nishii, 2013; Shore et al., 2011). The above reasons (Randel et al., 2016, 2018) suggest inclusive leadership supports belongingness to facilitate each team member’s contribution rather than assimilating collective needs or goals as transformational leaders do. According to (Chrobot-Mason et al., 2014; Randel et al., 2018), inclusive leadership stimulates team members to contribute their ideas and perspectives by encouraging members to discuss and exchange diverse opinions and ideas simultaneously, supports fruitful cooperation while valuing the distinctiveness and belongingness of team members. Inclusive leadership provides the conditions for teams to balance the individual need for uniqueness and belongingness and focus on managing team diversity's positive and negative outcomes, argued Ashikali et al. (2020).   Anticipated Themes      Chief Human Resource Officers (CHROs) among the top management ranks are growing, according to the literature and the upper echelon theory, and inclusive leadership in organizations. The upper echelons theory describes the paradox between those individuals acknowledged as practical for organizations to achieve gender-balanced and individuals perceived as having attractive organizational attributes, argue Windscheid et al. (2017). The presence of CHROs among the rank of top management is growing because the workforce is more diverse than ever and challenging organizations and societies with diversity issues (Turner & Merriman, 2021). Inclusive leadership promotes inclusion efforts, diversity, equity, and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 74 inclusion measures to increase motivation, job satisfaction, and organizational performance, claims Riccucci (2018). The negative aspects of diversity in the workplace drawn from the literature were investigated further in contrast with the benefits gained from the effectiveness of diversity management in the workplace. The inclusive climate theory is discussed in detail to provide insights that can help leaders perform their functions of managing, leading, and controlling and the lack of strategic leadership concerns in managing diversity. The research also looked at the emerging style of awakened and social leadership in the social age. According to Marques (2018), awakened leadership is a new dimension in the leadership equation and is critical for managing diversity in modern global organizations. The theory section related to the study is finalized by introducing awakening and social leadership styles that are considered new dimensions of leadership in the 21st century that are required in managing diversity. Awakened Leadership  According to Marques (2018), it is no longer acceptable to apply situational approaches that focus on tasks and people; awakened leadership, a new dimension in the leadership equation, is critical and required for an environment of increased diversity in dispersed work locations. Marques claims that efficiency and effectiveness only go so far without leadership that embraces an atmosphere of acceptance, inclusion, and mutual respect. Contemporary leaders at the helm of organizations must develop sensitivity toward and insight into misunderstanding and conflict among workers from various cultures and work ethics, where the need for awakened leadership emerges, posits Marques. According to Shelton (2012), leadership initiatives seldom come with a blueprint; hence, executives often make bad decisions wasting considerable time and money. Awakening is the felt sense that resides in the leader; in leadership, the goal is to take people and build them into teams for a common purpose, argues Shelton. (Davi & Spelman, 2018) STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 75 accordingly argued that engaged leadership requires breaking old habits and developing new ones to increase leadership capacity and be awakened. According to Marques, becoming an awakened leader is not easy because of the pressure one has to deal with in today's ever-changing work environment by compromising ethics and values for short-term results and fitting with elements of organizational culture that contrast with one's values. Moreover, society has created rules and perspectives one must learn to obey and the pressure to live up to standards based on identity, not to mention ego management, remarks Marques.  Social Leadership  Guglielmo and Palsule (2016), in their book, quoted Don E. Schultz, president of Agora, Inc., who said: it is time to say goodbye to lines and boxes, command and control, some leadership styles, and management practices, and welcome social systems that now rule the world, in which everyone and everything is connected. Social leaders will redefine how people think about leadership today; they will build communities to unleash creativity and innovation in an interconnected world, argue Guglielmo and Palsule. Accordingly, one can be a future leader only if one changes in a world of connectivity, openness, and access to information; a world in which society seeks greater engagement, leadership faces challenges and new opportunities, posit Guglielmo and Palsule. Social leadership will certainly correct most of the shortcomings of managing diversity in the virtual workplaces of contemporary business. Today a new phenomenon is taking place in the business environment, with the shift from consumer to prosumer, according to Guglielmo and Palsule.  Prosumer defines the shift in individuals from consumers who seek goods and services created for them to engage with companies in designing, developing proactively, and conceptions of new products and services in this social age, argue Guglielmo and Palsule. The STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 76 discourse on gender equality in the media, management, and organization literature concentrates on gender-linked reward and opportunity disparities in the corporate world and the rarity of women in leadership roles (e.g., Cook & Glass, 2014; Joshi et al., 2015a; Padavic et al. (2020; Ryan et al., 2016). This dialogue indicates the time has come to reverse this trend and for organizations to recognize the positive impact the presence of women and minority groups diversity brings to the business environment: these and other disparities in the workplace call for social leaders who embody new mindfulness. Hideg and Krstic (2021) ask where organizations stand in the quest for workplace gender equality in this millennium. They note that gender equality issues have shown more interest and social debate in the second decade of the 21st century despite many gender-related movements. They believe that organizations and management academics with the required expertise can conduct innovative research in this area to contribute insights and stimulate future workplace gender equality Integration and Learning  In the diversity management realm, researchers recognize that managing diversity in organizations is more than a business need but also an ethical need (Lozano & Escrich, 2017). Integration and learning approaches to diversity are positively related to perceived corporate ethical virtue on organizational behavior and interpersonal workplace deviance, according to findings from two studies from the USA and Germany, Rabl et al. (2018). Rabl et al. found that employees' perceptions of organizational integration and learning approach to diversity positively moderate organizational ethical virtue and high employee personal value for diversity, resulting in positive employee behaviors.  Globalization, technology, multiculturalism, and social engagement have created a complex world in which future leaders must prepare themselves to use fresh approaches crafted to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 77 promote their team’s awareness, creativity, and ability to function in new learning organizations, posits Roof (2016). According to Roof, effective future-oriented leadership employs design-thinking and creates learning organizations to spiritually meet their employees' higher-order needs. Senge (1990) argued that leaders who face globalization's complexity must pursue the learning organization to refocus and shift to a more transcendent mind. To reinforce the benefits of a learning organization, the head of Google’s Operations confirms that Google's success is attributed to its willingness to reward thoughtful failure that involves admitting mistakes, being transparent, accepting counsel, learning from others, and using insights from employees to teach other members of the team, Bock (2015). But accomplishing these fits will be challenging unless one has mindfulness of diversity in the workplace.  Inclusive Climate Inclusive leadership, mentioned several times throughout the text,  creates a climate that moderates the relationship between perceived surface-level diversity and team knowledge sharing that can mitigate the negative relationship leading to cross-national team members that engage with each other constructively, argued Ali et al. (2018). Organizations worldwide are trying to promote and reduce discriminatory tendencies toward people with disabilities (PWD), women, and minority groups entering the workforce in record numbers, posit Zhu et al. (2019). Researchers found during team learning that a high inclusion climate facilitates employees from disadvantaged groups to have more resources to build confidence, thus reinforcing the strength of their job efficacy. Randel et al. (2018) believe that individual differences can potentially increase the propensity to engage in inclusive leadership behaviors, such as pro-diversity beliefs positively associated with openness to diversity and the desire for leaders to incorporate diversity into their groups which could influence group outcomes, argues Homan et al. (2007). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 78 According to Stone-Romero et al. (2003), pro-diversity may facilitate openness toward diversity and allow leaders to create a group environment with a sense of belongingness by incorporating a diverse workforce composed of different gender, races, ethnicity, and cultural backgrounds of individuals. According to Bourke and Espedido (2019), six behaviors distinguish inclusive leaders from others: visible commitment, humility, awareness of bias, curiosity about others, cultural intelligence, and effective collaboration. These traits of inclusive leaders help them challenge the status quo, create space for others to contribute, be aware of personal blind spots, have an open mindset and listen without judgment, be attentive to others' cultures, and empower others by paying attention to the diversity of thinking, argued Bourke and Espedido. Summary of the Literature Review. This study reviewed the literature based on the defined conceptual framework described above by looking at leadership theories related to the topic of the study. It also looked at the constructs described in the framework and how they relate to diversity management, including the effects of organizational moral and cultural values, nationalism and exclusiveness, leadership behaviors, and much more. According to Yin (2018), a literature review has two purposes: to show the researcher's mastery over the topic of study and to support the development of more insightful research questions in a case study by reviewing previous research on the issue at hand. This literature examined the philosophical ontology and epistemology of managing diversity in academia, institutions, and private and public organizations. It looked at strategic leadership that substantiates decision-making responsibilities associated with managing diversity in the workplace as demographic changes and globalization challenge organizational functioning now and in the future. Zikmund et al. (2013) posit that without a literature review of previous studies, the researcher may not be able to develop research questions or hypotheses that would direct the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 79 project toward published works, including periodicals and books that discuss theory and present empirical results relevant to the topic of study. This literature review investigated several positive or negative issues related to the strategic management of diversity in the workplace. This literature review also focused on the need for rival explanations in diversity management. According to Yin (2018), a broader spirit of rival thinking is necessary in all case studies as central quality control in interpreting the study findings. There are theories for and against workforce diversity in the literature presenting convincing evidence that should not be ignored. Related studies for managing diversity look at the relationships between the concepts, theories, and constructs that represent the foundation of this case research. Following the description of the problem, the concepts concerning managing diversity are evaluated first, including moral values and ethics that can influence diversity; the importance of cultural competencies required to enhance awareness, the positive effect of diversity in stimulating innovation; how diversity practices in organizations can promote trust in leadership; how leadership behaviors positively or negatively affect diversity in the workplace; how globalization transforms business reality. Second, views of other theories from the literature that enable researchers to gain knowledge and describe the phenomenon of managing diversity are discussed, including servant, transformational, charismatic, inclusive leadership theories, critical race, feminism, critical theories that, in one way or another impact the management of diversity in the workplace. Finally, the study looked at the constructs and their relationship with managing diversity; these include how top executives can promote diversity, how organizational moral values contribute to workplace happiness, how change at the top of management can produce differences when other strategies are not producing the expected outcomes in promoting diversity; the positive impact transformational leadership has in empowering and motivating STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 80 employees; the negative consequences ethnocentrism and nationalism have about inclusiveness in the workplace. Summary of Section 1 and Transition The inconsistencies about diversity in the workplace and how complex the process is becoming a double-edged sword and context-specific. Viewed through the lens of integration and learning, diversity management is seen as a resource to increase creativity and innovation. Organizations implement diversity from the lens of discrimination and fairness to prevent adverse outcomes. Diversity management and inclusion complement one another to bring the positive outcomes organizations expect from a diverse workforce. According to the literature, diversity can negatively affect organizational performance and workers' health, job satisfaction, and retention. However, the researcher of this study thinks the negative effect of diversity can be attributed to a lack of leadership to effectively implement diversity management in the workplace. In the initial literature review of this case study, the researcher explored theories and concepts related to managing diversity in the workplace, including servant leadership, charismatic leadership, and other leadership styles. This section also reviews concepts such as the moral values and ethical behaviors of organizational leadership and how they can influence the implementation of diversity management. These concepts describe how cultural competencies can help leaders enhance their awareness of diversity, the innovation brought to organizational functioning by employees from different backgrounds, and the expertise of a diverse workforce; how leadership trustworthiness is necessary for promoting diversity in organizations; the role of leadership behavior plays in the management of diversity; and finally, how globalization is impacting the transformation of modern business. This first section of the study also reviews theories related to managing diversity in the workplace. These theories STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 81 include servant leadership to provide solutions in improving positive organizational outcomes related to diversity in the workplace; charismatic leadership to help in decision‐making and moderation of the relationship between diversity and performance; transformational leadership that can moderate the negative relationship between diversity and organizational citizenship behavior; inclusive leadership known to display behaviors that give employees the perceptions of belongingness in the workplace; critical race theory to make visible social processes that work against dominated classes; and other theories that are reviewed in the next section in details.  Section 2: The Project      The researcher of this qualitative case study has addressed several subjects related to leadership strategy for managing diversity in the workplace. The researcher’s aim is to contribute to the fundamental knowledge and theories for understanding how the business world operates by formulating problem-solving programs and interventions in managing diversity. The research is a case study with a flexible method for collecting data using interviews, surveys, archival documents, field notes, and memos to gather information and analyze the data to find meanings related to the studied topic. The participants are employees working for an organization in West Africa that relies on technology to run their business. A stratified sampling process is used on the target population to select those employees who meet the requirements for participation in the study. The data collection plan seeks evidence that would count as organizational practices concerning diversity management. The data was organized and analyzed using Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis (CAQDAS), such as NVivo; triangulation and bracketing were used to strengthen validity and reliability. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 82 Purpose Statement      This qualitative, flexible design case study aims to contribute to fundamental knowledge and theory, to understand how the world operates and why individuals do what they do, behave as they do, think, and know. Typically, this study would make fundamental theoretical contributions, using an inductive strategy for generating and confirming theories that emerge from close involvement and direct contact with the empirical world, as stated by (Glasser & Strauss, 1967). These are contributions that can be used to formulate problem-solving programs and interventions. This case study - the failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity in an organization - was conducted by bringing personal insights and experiences, testing and formulating theoretical constructs, searching for insights, and focusing on problems and issues of managing diversity with clarity and rigor in real-world situations. Leaders with diverse Mindsets understand that the reasons for making decisions may not be as influential as the interpretations people make about those decisions because the narratives people hold in their heads will determine the reactions to the leadership decisions (Bushe & Marshak, 2014). The study focused on operations and procedures leaders could use to enhance organizational diversity and inclusion for competitive advantage using proven workforce diversity management practices. Researchers found that exemplary leadership from those at the top of the hierarchy with inspirational motivation can compensate for the lack of inclusive group attitudes to openness with the language of diversity to create a working environment where motivated employees strive to attain their organizations' objectives (Lauring & Jonasson, 2018). Role of the Researcher      The role researchers play, and their emotional attachment to the study can be beneficial. Still, it can also disqualify the researchers if the type of reflection and reactions deviate them off STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 83 course, argued Maxwell (2013). That said, the researcher's role is fundamental in qualitative research. Most importantly, the researcher's positionality shapes their work and influences their interpretation, understanding, and beliefs in the truthfulness and validity of other's research which they read and expose, argued Holmes (2020). According to Holmes, researchers are required to use self-reflection and reflexivity approaches on an ongoing basis to identify, construct, critique, and articulate their positionality.      The researcher, in this case study, seeks to understand and explain a situation and predict behaviors from data collection and analysis by developing theories or patterns from participants while collecting data (Mackenzie & Knipe, 2006). During data collection, the researcher's role includes locating evidence in different data sources and triangulating to shed light and validate their findings (Creswell & Poth, 2018). In qualitative methods, the researcher's relationship with the participants is bounded by what is being examined, asserted Robson and McCartan (2016). For this reason, all any study can do is approximate knowledge of the situation as they exist in the real world. Therefore, a researcher must be flexible while carrying out research and rely on themselves as the instrument instead of specialist tools and agencies. According to Robson and McCartan, all potential biases are brought out into the open, and effort must be made to counter them. However, the notion of the researcher as instrument, according to Robson and McCartan, in qualitative research, may lead to bias; but a prolonged approach of fieldwork in flexible methods can help reduce both reactivity and respondent and researcher bias. The Actions the Researcher Took to Conduct the Study According to the National Research Council (2003, pp. 23-28), mindfulness in conducting research involves gaining informed consent from all participants; protecting those participants from harm or deception; protecting the privacy and confidentiality of the participants; taking STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 84 special precautions to protect vulnerable groups; selecting participants equitably so that no groups are unfairly included or excluded from the research. As part of safeguarding participants, the researcher is responsible for conducting a study with special care and sensitivity, posits Yin (2018). To conduct a research study, researchers are engaged with the people they observe by establishing rapport with them; they participate in the activities at the site to gain insider views and access to subjective data; researchers can also act as outsiders of the group under study, watching and taking notes, they record data without direct involvement with the activities or the people (Angrosino, 2007; Bernard, 2011; Bogdewic, 1999). Creswell and Poth (2018) assert that an excellent qualitative researcher may change role during an observation by being a nonparticipant and then moving to a participant role, and vice versa. According to Maxwell, a researcher's actions include planning the research, the who, where, when, and how of collecting and making sense of the data. These activities are not limited to data collection but include establishing relationships with those selected for the study, choosing sites, participants observation, analyzing the data, interviewing, and knowing how to design the approaches and methods in qualitative research, posits Maxwell.  Researchers develop interview questions to understand the study context from the participants, collect data, synthesize and integrate the insights by eliminating redundancies and clarifying or elaborating the meaning of the data, notes Giorgi (1979). Researchers observe participants to understand better the context in which people live and share activities; discover and deduce what is significant; observe activities to infer meanings, and learn things that participants are willing to disclose; researchers include their perceptions of what is essential to understanding the setting; observation also able the researcher to gather data through direct experience (Moustakas, 1994, p. 3). According to Maxwell (2012, p. 100), interview questions STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 85 are what you ask people; this process requires creativity and insight and is not a conversion of the research questions into an interview guide. Further, Maxwell asserts that interview questions do not follow the logical deduction from the research questions; the two are distinct and separate parts of the design, which can confuse researchers.  The researcher will establish and carry out a series of methods and procedures required for a disciplined study, argues Moustakas (1994). These methods are employed in a particular way associated with their ontological assumptions; they offer the researcher a way of gathering information and enable another researcher to emulate the techniques for validating research, asserts Grix (2018). However, to collect data and interview participants, the researcher must seek permission, gain access through gatekeepers, gain participants' confidence, and anticipate ethical issues (Creswell & Poth, 2018). In this specific study, the researcher gained entry to a technology-driven organization in West Africa and, with the participants' confidence. The researcher then conducted interviews and surveys to follow up on off-hand remarks made by interviewees that suggested relevant hypotheses, as suggested by King et al. (2021).  The researcher used theories and constructs in this case study to build interview questions about organizational diversity management. According to King et al., researchers use inference during data collection, using the facts they know, such as data or observation, to learn about the facts they do not know that are the subjects of the research questions, theories, and hypotheses. According to (Maruyama & Ryan, 2014), theories incorporate hypothesized links between constructs and observable variables, which specify the constructs' behaviors or indicators. A theory comprises hypotheses composed of statements about associations among the constructs. (e.g., CEO's moral values contribute to workplace diversity management). In this example, the researcher can interpret the theory as CEO's moral values leading to influential attitudes that lead STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 86 to positive expectations, empathy, or trust, which can reduce prejudice and discrimination or negative expectations that could worsen the situation. For example: what did the participants experience about the CEO's moral values? Or what context or conditions influenced the CEO's moral values that the participants could experience? These are two broad questions based on the theories and constructs listed in this specific study's conceptual framework. The researcher used other theories and constructs to build interview questions asked to participants.  A researcher can use interviews to complement observations to analyze available documents for the purpose of comparing written and spoken words, according to Blaxter et al. (2010). The researcher of this particular case study also used documents, such as archived documents from HR, about practices and procedures for hiring, promotion, and training all employees that provide insights relevant to diversity management. For a good reason, the researcher in this qualitative case study used surveys to follow up an interview with identified issues and then asked questions to complement the observations. Using interviews, surveys, or documents to gather information allows the researcher to verify the validity of the information collected from various sources; this is a form of triangulation, posits Blaxter. The researcher of this case study asked participants two broad relevant questions about managing diversity in the workplace. These include questions about what the participants experienced regarding the phenomenon and the context or situations that influenced or affected their experiences of the event. The researcher used open-ended questions relevant to research questions based on the theories and constructs described in the conceptual framework that underly this study. Bracketing to Void Personal Bias      Bracketing, reflexivity, and transparency in a study are necessary to maintain a positive participant-research rapport, prevent potential participant-researcher tensions, and maximize STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 87 awareness (Esmene & Kirsop-Taylor, 2021). Bracketing is a strategy researchers use to deal with external disruptions to qualitative fieldwork, posit Esmene, and Kirsop-Taylor. Researchers and participants may develop opposing views driven by political and social change that influence their interactions, according to Esmene and Kirsop-Taylor. The United Kingdom's (UK) 2016 Brexit referendum caused by societal tensions in the differences between opinions on the benefit of the country being a European Union (UN) member (Hobolt, 2016) is an example that shows how tensions can arise between participants because of external factors. In such situations, thought must be given to how qualitative researchers reflexively deal with uncertainties that pose risks to the rapport individuals have built, posit Esmene and Kirsop-Taylor.  Bracketing is used in qualitative research to alleviate potential tensions between the researcher and participants (Gearing, 2004; Tufford & Newman, 2010). It is used to create moments when a researcher should refrain from acting in line with their preconceptions and biases; it is influenced by the study's context and applied during the study progression through design, data collection, data management, and analysis, argues Drew (2004). Bracketing decisions must be situated in the study's context retrospectively during data management and analysis and when reflexivity becomes a key process to ensure consistency in a qualitative data analysis phase, argued Esmene and Kirsop-Taylor (2021). Therefore, this study employed bracketing to set aside the researcher's beliefs, feeling, and perceptions, more open to situations being studied, and not forget what has been experienced, not letting past knowledge be involved while determining experiences (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Giorgi, 1979). For example, in researching the failure of management of diversity in the workplace, the researcher must put aside their beliefs, feelings, and perceptions even though they had experienced similar leadership failure in managing diversity. The researcher will bracket out as much as possible their personal STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 88 experiences. The researcher will conduct and record a lengthy person-to-person interview that focuses on a bracketed topic and question, as suggested by Moustakas (1994, p. 103). The researcher used bracketing to deal with questions of anger, suspicion, joy, and the like by shutting out their preconceived biases and judgment and setting aside voices and silences that can tell what something is, as outlined by Moustakas. The researcher will be mindful of the multiple sources of analytic bias that can weaken or even invalidate research findings. Some of these biases include going native, losing their perspective, or bracketing ability to co-opt into the perceptions and explanations of the participants (Miles et al. 2014). Moustakas (1994) believes that prejudices and unhealthy attachment to false reality can be bracketed and put out of action (p. 90). Through data analysis, the researcher used analytic bracketing to stay indifferent to everyday life structures, documented their production through discursive practice, and assessed the reality, as described by (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018).  LeVasseur (2003) put it intelligently by describing the technique of bracketing as an attempt to hold prior knowledge or beliefs about events under study in suspense to perceive the situation clearly. That is true when the researcher's lived experience and that of the participant who lived the same event under investigation may experience it differently based on the context of the event. Giorgi (2009) sees this sort of bracketing as a matter not of forgetting what has been experienced but of not letting past knowledge be engaged while determining experiences. Several examples are cited in the literature where the same demand holds (e.g., a juror hearing in a trial that a piece of evidence is not admissible, or a researcher may hope a hypothesis will be supported but then note the results do not support it), as cited by Giorgi. Van Manen (2014) describes the process of bracketing and reduction as a phenomenological reflection.  Bracketing STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 89 personal experiences is not easy for the researcher because analysis and interpretation of the data incorporate the researcher's assumptions about the topic (van Manen, 1990, 2014). Perhaps researchers need a new concept of epoche or bracketing, such as suspending their understandings in a reflective move that cultivates curiosity, suggests LeVasseur.  In this case study, the researcher used three phases in implementing bracketing, as described by Dörfler (2021). In the first phase, the researcher/interviewer bracketed out the preunderstandings, beliefs, and values by keeping an open mind and listening efficiently to the participants. In the second phase, the researcher used bracketing during data collection by preparing field notes to raise awareness about missed elements during the interview process. According to Dörfler, this phase is implemented through transpersonal reflexivity and corresponds to psychological reduction and elements of transcendental reduction. The purpose of the second stage of bracketing, according to Dörfler, is to bring to the surface presumptions, previous knowledge, and beliefs of which the interviewer was not aware. This bracketing phase is achieved by practicing transpersonal reflexivity. In the third phase, when the researcher engages in analysis, the bracketing will be used again to make sense of the data collected. The three instances of bracketing described are pursued by the researcher/interviewer alone and involve personal reflexivity, according to Finlay (2008a). Summary The researchers' role, the actions they must take to conduct their study, and how they use bracketing to avoid biases are essential elements in qualitative research. As described above, the researcher can wear many hats when conducting their research, including the role of a teacher, observer, storyteller, advocate, and others. When conducting studies, researchers must suspend their judgments to avoid biases and reveal their positionality, which shapes their work and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 90 influences their interpretation, understanding, and beliefs in the truthfulness and validity of others' studies in which their research barrows. Positionality reflects the researcher's position within a research study (Savin-Baden & Major, 2013, p.71). It influences how research is conducted, its outcomes and results, and what a researcher has chosen to investigate (Rowe, 2014; Malterud, 2001; Grix, 2019). Positionality, according to Holmes (2020), locates the researcher in three areas: (1) the subject under investigation, (2) the research participants, and (3) the research context and process. Aspects of positionality might be culturally ascribed or generally fixed, such as gender, race, skin color, nationality, political views, personal life history, and subjective contextual experience, Chiseri-Strater (1996). (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018, p. 46) described positionality as the personal standpoint through which the fieldworker perceives ways of seeing and feeling mutually constructed in the interaction between the observer and observed. Research Methodology According to Maxwell (2013), there is no cookbook for qualitative methods; the appropriate use of any technique depends on the issue, the context of the research, and other design components. Additionally, a researcher should use the proper methodology to answer the research questions rather than the most prevalent ones (Robson & McCartan, 2016). For this single case study, a flexible method was chosen. The researcher also examined triangulation methods to ensure confidence in the findings and construct validity with this case study. There is anticipation that the design will emerge and develop with a flexible design approach during data collection; it is a work in progress that can adapt as the research evolves (Robson & McCartan, 2016).  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 91 Discussion of Single Case Study This flexible design case study investigated the failure of strategic leadership in managing diversity to distinguish and specify the philosophical assumptions of the phenomenon and fully described the participants' views by collecting data from individuals who have experienced the situation. In this study, the researcher used multiple methods of collecting data from participants through interviews, surveys, observations, archived documents, and querying the same participants several times, using notes, recordings, and journals to triangulate. The researcher first developed a set of questions to guide the interview process based on the theories and constructs described in the conceptual framework. The interviews were recorded to ensure accuracy during analysis. A survey was used to follow up on the interviews to clarify some points brought up during the interviewing process. Second, the researcher used observations and notes during field fieldwork to learn about participants' behaviors and assess the environment in an authentic setting. Third, the interviewer asked to review documents related to hiring, promotion, and training of employees if they are available. These documents were compared to the data collected from the interviews and observations for triangulation, validity, and trustworthiness to fill some gaps or test hypotheses. The researcher hopes to extrapolate the findings for generalization. The researcher built an argument to support the rationale behind using a case study to examine diversity management. The research design resulted from decisions based on knowledge gained from experience, the methodological literature, the research questions, and the conceptual framework surrounding them. The rationale in support of qualitative methods in case studies, according to (Marshall & Rossman, 2015), entails the following decision areas: assumptions of the qualitative approaches, sampling of the population included in the study, the justification of the design of data collection, the aspects of fieldwork, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 92 the consideration of ethical issues, and trustworthiness of the overall approach. In this qualitative flexible case study, the researcher considered and discussed each decision area throughout the study. Discussion of Methods for Triangulation Triangulation is applying the combination of theoretical and methodological approaches to studying the same phenomenon; it is a strategy researchers use to overcome weaknesses or biases and, as a validation method, posit Denzin and Lincoln (p. 319). According to (Fielding & Fielding, 1986), triangulation involves using different methods to determine if methods with different strengths and limitations lead to the same conclusion. Nevertheless, Fielding and Fielding point out that triangulation might not increase validity if the triangulation methods have some biases and sources of invalidity. Greene (2007, pp. 79-83) added that using triangulation to confirm a conclusion can be problematic, and using different methods is most valuable for providing divergent perspectives to understand a situation better. Similarly, Bloor (1997, pp. 38-41) argued that triangulation might raise logical and practical difficulties because findings from different methods can differ to a degree, and a direct comparison can be problematic. Denzin (1978) identified four types of triangulation: data triangulation which uses a variety of data sources in a study; investigator triangulation, which uses several different researchers or evaluators, primarily seen in multiple case studies, not practical in this particular single case study; Theory triangulation employs numerous perspectives of the same data set; finally, methodological triangulation that uses various methods to study as a single problem, for example using qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis.  The elements used for triangulation in this study will be data triangulation utilizing a variety of data collection such as interviews, surveys, documents, archives, and observation to boost the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 93 construct of validity of the case study, as suggested by Yin (2018). The researcher also used theoretical triangulation in this study by drawing from numerous perspectives in the literature that have studied the issues of managing diversity in the workplace. But most importantly, The rationale for using triangulation in a case study lies in the possibility of collecting data from various sources of evidence, according to Yin (2018). According to Maxwell (2013), collecting data from multiple sources gives the conclusion more credibility and allows one to gain information about different aspects of the case study. Summary of Research Methodology      The methodology in this qualitative flexible case for conducting this study was appropriate because the research is exploratory and descriptive and stresses the importance of the context in which the event took place, the setting, and the subjects in the study. According to King et al. (2021), descriptive work is essential and depends in part on good explanation, is critical in case studies, and is fundamental to social science; however, explaining what is not described is pointless. Flexible, qualitative strategies are appropriate for exploratory work such as this particular case study. According to (Robson & McCartan, 2016), during data analysis, the researcher will rely on exploratory and confirmatory instruments to explore the data to find out what the data reveal and its meanings and establish whether the result is what was expected to be found. This study will focus on research questions and a sample of people, events, and processes; thus, well-structured instrument designs are appropriate.       The rationale for using the methodology was grounded in the research's conceptual framework and research questions. It relied on interviews as the primary method for collecting data. It utilized other methods such as observations, fieldwork notes, documents, and other techniques to identify, organize, and analyze information to understand organizational diversity STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 94 management. The rationality of doing a case study drew on the ability to use multiple sources of evidence when collecting data to triangulate and validate the research conclusion. Using data and theory triangulations allows the researcher to use different sources for gathering data and different perspectives for interpretation from the literature to strengthen the design and the validity of the findings. The researcher in this study used theoretical and methodological triangulation to validate the research conclusion, including using interviews, documents, observations, fieldwork notes, and theories drawn from the literature.        This qualitative research used a flexible design and appropriate methods to explore the success and failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity in organizations in West Africa. This study looks at the research's design, methodology, and purpose described above in the purpose statement. An overview of the role and actions taken by the researcher to conduct the study has been presented, including the discussion of bracketing to avoid biases and the suitability of the chosen research methods for triangulation, which allowed the researcher to validate research conclusions. According to Miles et al. (2014), qualitative data represent a well-grounded, rich description of social events that can lead to findings that help researchers go beyond conceptions and generate new understanding. Researchers need to construct credible and trustworthy meaning from qualitative data through research methods that provide knowledge others can rely on. This study, as described above, focused on the research design choices, such as the conceptual framework, methodology, research questions, data collection methods, techniques, and strategies that define the edges of managing diversity in an organization. Participants      In this case study, the participants are employees of an organization in West Africa that relies on technology to run their business. This organization has been in the security business for over a STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 95 decade and operates in several African countries. The participants in this study included an HR director, several supervisors, an assistant to the HR director, another assistant to the CEO, a chief accountant, a security chief, a commercial manager, a production manager, a steward, cleaning employees, suppliers, and their subordinates. These employees have provided information through interviews and surveys, and the H.R. director provided company documents concerning managing a diverse workforce. Africa is a continent with several ethnicities, cultures, beliefs, and multiple spoken languages and is considered the next frontier for global corporations to launch new adventures. The figure below is a crosstab query that checks the coding spread across cases and demographic variables using NVivo. Figure 2. Crosstab query of the coding spread across cases and demographic variables.  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 96  Population and Sampling      These participants represent a variety of demographics, including people of different identities, religious backgrounds, and age differences in the social settings of organizations and the workplace in general. All the above actors are eligible to participate because they represent the sources of evidence, whether through interviews, observations, archived documents, or surveys, and understand the issues or situations being studied, as Maxwell (2013) emphasized in their study. In particular, in this study, all participants were chosen for their knowledge and experience in the specific problem and failure to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity resulting in the potential decrease in workers' job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities to senior leadership positions. \"Diversity is an inescapable reality for any corporation with more than 100 people, wherever it is located,\" says David Thomas, a professor at Harvard Business School, according to Hymowitz (2005). Discussion of Population At the start of the sampling process, the target population was defined so that the sources of data collection could be identified. The practical way to describe the target population is to answer questions about the characteristics of the individual elements of the population, according to Zikmund et al. (2013). When conducting a research project, the researcher's purpose is typically to describe the respondents' sample and make an inference about the population. To make this inference, the researcher must know about the population distribution, the sample distribution, and the sampling distribution, Zikmund et al. In this case study, the population comprised employees working in the organization, including an HR director, other managers, and their subordinates. All these employees are included because they met the sampling procedure criteria that established the boundaries of the case. These employees can make or STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 97 influence decisions about managing diversity practices. They have lived or experienced the event (e.g., managers and subordinates) or knew about the phenomenon. They are managers who lead their employees and are involved with approving decisions made by those they lead. In organizations, the board members are responsible for laying out the organization's bylaws and presiding over the board of directors' meetings to ensure they conduct the business orderly. These leaders can approve or disapprove of the policies governing diversity management practices and were included in the sample. The researcher used a nonprobability sampling approach, a purposive sampling method, because the HR director had to select the participants with guidance from the researcher. This sample was combined with probability sampling focusing on homogenous and critical case sampling. Table 1. Age Spread of Participants  Frequency Percent Valid Percent Cumulative Percent Valid 20-30 2 13.3 13.3 13.3 30-40 3 20.0 20.0 33.3 40-45 4 26.7 26.7 60.0 50-55 5 33.3 33.3 93.3 60-65 1 6.7 6.7 100.0 Total 15 100.0 100.0   Discussion of Sampling According to (Farrugia, 2019; Miles et al., 2014), qualitative research decisions about research sampling are guided by a study's research questions and conceptual framework that helps to focus the research and establish the boundaries of a case. The purpose of this study is about strategy for managing diversity addressed in the research questions; the sample consisted of employees of all demographics composed of Blacks, Whites, Spanish, and other ethnicities representing a diverse workforce. The sample's composition from the target population was STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 98 relatively heterogeneous and included employees at the upper-level hierarchy with leadership roles, middle managers, team leaders, and subordinates. This case study selected a probability sampling with nonzero probability combined with a nonprobability sampling to compensate for the weaknesses of one method with the strengths of the other method. The nonzero term means that when the sample was selected, every element in the target population had a chance to be chosen, as Daniel (2012) described. Because of the study's exploratory nature, specific individuals needing a representative to minimize bias were targeted. As Daniel suggested, combining both sampling procedures allows the research to deal with the population's heterogeneity and the small sample size according to qualitative research design requirements.  According to (Farmer & Farmer, 2021), in nonprobability sampling, researchers use their judgment regarding the sample characteristics that address their study's needs. The researcher used the purposive sampling of the nonprobability sampling procedure to define the target population based on identifiable inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the study. Purposive sampling focuses on minimizing or maximizing the variability of the sample, and the elements selected are prime candidates that are most likely to inform the theories related to the study. For this particular case study, the inclusion criteria for participation in the study included being members of a diverse workforce that have experienced leadership strategy failure for managing diversity resulting in the potential decrease in workers' job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities to senior leadership positions. According to (Dobbin & Kalev, 2016), diversity gives organizations an edge with the ability to innovate and solve problems. But it seems so hard to promote diversity in many organizations.  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 99 Because of the study's nature, the researcher combined purposive sampling with probability sampling to stratify the sample. The researcher used stratified random sampling to compare how diversity management was experienced by these subgroups composed of a diverse workforce. The steps to stratify the sample of the target population in this particular study included dividing the population into homogeneous segments or strata with the variables (1) Whites, (2) Blacks, (3) Spanish, and (4) Others. The 'Others' variable represents the undercovered elements and may include other minority groups, which is necessary for identifying the sampling frame that must consist of each element of the target population. The chosen variables above relate to the purpose of diversity in the workplace. A disproportionate stratified sampling was used because the elements allocated to the various strata were not proportional to the representation of the strata in the target population. Each stratum has at least five elements or more. Then the researcher used a simple random sample to select elements from each stratum; at least one element was selected from each stratum for representation in the sample. The samples chosen from the various strata were combined into a single sample, representing the participants in the study. Stratified sampling, according to researchers, will increase precision and representativeness because the procedure gives every element in each possible sample size an equal chance of being selected. Combining these two sampling procedures, probability sampling, and nonprobability sampling, proved favorable because of the study's importance and exploratory nature. Summary of Population and Sampling Population and sampling in qualitative research or any other research design represent the foundation of a research study. The population in this specific study was composed of employees working in an organization in West Africa. The sample from this population included operational managers, executive leaders, team leaders, and subordinates who lived or knew about the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 100 phenomenon being studied. The researcher made sure that the target population was defined rigorously with the specificity of its attributes, including the nature of the elements, sampling units, and geographical location, by paying attention to all the requirements. The researcher used a nonprobability sampling approach, particularly purposive sampling, combined with probability sampling, focusing on homogenous and critical case sampling. Data Collection Data collection involves developing means for recording information using intelligent devices and storing the data in secure places. For this qualitative case study, the researcher used interviews, observation, survey questionnaires, documents, archived data, and field notes to collect the principal, secondary, and other information required to answer and meet the topic objectives needed for analysis purposes. The data collected were related to processes for managing a diverse workforce. For qualitative research, the researcher is concerned with exploring a topic and is mainly concerned with processes; for quantitative analysis, the approach focuses more on deductive testing of hypotheses and theories, posit Blaxter et al. (2010). Qualitative research focuses on text and writing, from field notes, transcripts, descriptions, interpretations, and the presentation of the findings, as described by Flick (2018). The data collection methods employed in this research are appropriate because the researcher was only interested in accessing experiences, interactions, and documents in their natural context. After the data is collected, it must be organized. Maxwell (2012) made a good remark about data collection by reminding researchers that the methods they use to collect data do not necessarily follow logical deductions from the research questions. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 101 Data Collection Plan In this particular case study of strategic leadership for managing diversity, the researcher used various data collection techniques, including participant observation, interviews, documentaries, surveys, field notes, memos, etc. The data collected concerned organizations' strategies and planning processes to promote diversity. The researcher was interested in participants' behaviors, feelings, memories, and policies in organizational practices related to the topic of study. In particular, the researcher sought evidence that would count as organizational practices concerning diversity management and wished to explore how diversity is promoted and how leaders' values and cultural competencies contribute to or impact workplace diversity management. All data collected needed to focus on specific information to answer the research questions, the concepts, constructs, and theories described in the research.      The participants' objectivity was fundamental to the reliability and validity of the research results. According to (Kirk & Miller, 2011), objectivity is the realization of the coexistence of reliability and validity; reliability - is the extent to which the research finding is independent of accidental circumstances; and validity - is the extent to which the discovery is interpreted correctly. Hence, the researcher can use triangulation through multiple data sources to corroborate evidence and verify the validity and reliability of data collected thru interviews and surveys conducted during fieldwork. However, Fielding and Fielding (1986) argued with skepticism that triangulation might not automatically increase validity because the triangulated methods may have the same biases and sources of invalidity, resulting in a false sense of security. In contrast, Maxwell (2012) argued that a triangulation strategy reduces the risk of the conclusion reflecting biases of one specific method and allows one to understand the issues one is investigating. Hence, the debate about triangulation is still heating up. To meet construct STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 102 validity, the researcher defined diversity management in specific concepts related to the study's objectives and identified published research studies that match the concepts, as Yin (2018) described in their case study research applications. The researcher was to understand the problem better and extend the current leadership body of knowledge to a specific context.      Qualitative research data collection method is frequently used when the research question requires rich textual data or an in-depth understanding of issues, such as this one, and for hearing the voices and stories of participants (Janesick, 2010; Merrilees & Miller, 2008). Therefore, in this case study, the data collection focused on the planning strategies for managing diversity, including integrating diversity management into the organization's H.R. practices. It sought information about the moral values of leaders and their influence on diversity management, including leaders' cultural competency and beliefs. It sought information about how globalization and ethnocentrism consequently affect the strategic management of diversity. For this single case study concerning strategies for managing diversity, the researcher collected data using interviews, field notes, observations, documents, memos, and surveys. For a single study with a flexible design, such as this one, the methods listed above for collecting data were appropriate for a qualitative research study.      The concept of research paradigm includes assumptions such as axiology - the nature of values and ethics; methodology - the essence of systematic inquiries; and other assumptions relevant for qualitative constructivist researchers, asserts Mertens (2018). The researcher is obligated to ensure the ethics of their work by holding a value-neutral position and holding ethical conduct by including the voice of participants in decisions about the research and how it will be done Christians (2011). The researcher of this case study embraced this concept of ethics concerning the study of leadership strategy for managing diversity. This concept is also reflected STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 103 in the writings of Billups (2019), where she asserted that ethics concerns every study that involves human beings. According to her, ethical considerations in research involve the individuals' right to understand the boundaries of voluntary participation, informed consent, anonymity, privacy, or confidential data treatment, and the researcher's obligations to safeguard their rights and interests. The terrain of qualitative research is filled with ethical dilemmas researchers must deal with, especially during fieldwork. For this reason, the researcher followed Miles et al. (2020) advice on ethics, which includes: 1) Anticipation: raising earlier specific ethical issues during the design phase to help avoid problems later. 2) Third parties: Ethical issues tend to be masked by taken-for-granted assumptions, values, attitudes, and beliefs, and engaging a trusted third party can signal the researcher's attention. 3) Regular checking and renegotiation: Any qualitative study involves unanticipated twists and turns that must be handled ethically. Instruments Interview Guides      In this particular case, the researcher used a semistructured interview. According to Billups (2019), semistructured interviews are a common type of qualitative interviewing, especially in case studies, because they allow the researcher to define the areas to explore and discover information essential to the participants. A semistructured qualitative research interview aims to obtain descriptions of the interviewee's worldview to interpret the described phenomena (Brinkmann & Kvale, 2015, p. 6). Researchers use interviews to explore in detail the experiences, motives, and opinions of others and learn to see the world from their perspectives, posit (Rubin & Rubin, 2005). The interview questions are constructed based on the research questions, concepts, theories, and constructs described in the research framework, see Table 39. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 104 Semi-structured Interview English Version According to Denzin and Lincoln (2018), semistructured interviews make better use of the knowledge-producing potentials of dialogues with leeway for follow-up and a greater chance of visibility than the more unstructured interviews. Surveys      To achieve a research goal, questionnaires should be designed to link the survey questions to the research questions analytically by providing a valid measure of the research questions and getting the cooperation of respondents (Robson & McCartan, 2016). In this case study, the researcher used a 4-point, forced Likert to force the user to form an opinion. See Table 41 Survey Questionnaire Guide The questionnaires are linked to the research questions, constructs, concepts, and theories with opened-ended and closed questions. According to Brace (2018), many of the scales used in measuring attitude, perceptions, and customer satisfaction (employee satisfaction in this case) are considered interval scales, such as the Likert scale. Because this is interval data, means and standard deviations can be calculated for each statement. According to Robson and McCartan (2016), items on a Likert scale can look attractive to respondents and are likely to give considered rather than perfunctory answers because they may not be prepared to cooperate in something boring. Archive Data The research collected documents from the HR director of this African organization, company regulations, site documents from published minutes, and archival records from board meetings. The data have relationships in this study's conceptual framework to be explored. The researcher sought and obtained documents within the organization that its leadership team was willing to share. These documents included the organization's standard practices, official STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 105 documents, and policies identified as influential to the company's diversity management practices. According to Yin (2014), documentary information relevant to every case study can take many forms, including archival records, and should be considered in any data collection plan. These archives can contain an event's exact references and details, such as management practices covering an extended period, many events, and settings. Archival records include letters, memoranda, e-mails, personal documents, such as diaries, notes, administrative papers, minutes of meetings, proposals, progress reports, evaluations related to other case studies, and articles in the mass media that corroborate, and augment evidence from other sources, argues Yin. Researchers can also make inferences from archives but must treat inferences only as clues worthy of further investigation rather than definitive findings because the inferences could be false leads. A case study can trace the course of events and show how archives can contribute by constructing different understandings of an event. Archival records related to this case study include organizational forms, such as personal records and survey data produced by others about the participants in this case study. According to Yin (2014), when archival evidence has been deemed relevant, the researcher must ascertain the conditions under which it was produced because most archived records are created for a specific purpose other than the researcher's case study. Data Organization      The data generated by qualitative research confront researchers when the collection phase has ended before beginning the analysis, asserts Patton (1990). Today, technology has made organizing data much more manageable by storing survey questions, interview data, test scores, and other data in case studies. These software packages serve as a recourse for inspecting the raw data that lead to the case study conclusion. The researcher used CAQDAS (Computer Assisted STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 106 Qualitative Data Analysis Software) to assist with qualitative database management capabilities in this case study. These tasks include storing field notes, digital recordings, site documents, transcriptions, coded data, the coding scheme, and analytical memos (Miles et al., 2020). According to researchers familiar with this software package, NVivo, the leading software solution for researchers and educators, has become the most cited software for qualitative data analysis. This software package enables the researcher to search and retrieve records and display the information in matrices or graphics using numerous forms. The researcher of this study used NVivo to store, maintain and analyze the collected data in this case study. NVivo allows researchers to organize data such as coding, cases, people, places, or organizations being researched. It helps organize notes, memos, and interview transcripts. This software allows researchers to explore, visualize, develop ideas, present analysis, charts, and diagrams, create queries, and manage workflow efficiency with integrated features. With NVivo, researchers can collect attributes, description information, photos, and other documents. Summary of Data Collection      Data collection for case studies raises several issues because it involves collecting data from people, institutions, and everyday situations. Data collection, as described above, involves an interactive cyclical process, and researchers move among the different nodes, interviewing, surveying, taking notes, writing memos, reviewing archival documents, condensing, and displaying data (Miles et al., 2020). The researcher must integrate real-world events and adhere to ethical standards that underpin the data collection process, asserts Yin (2018). Researchers must implement the strategy with ethical mindfulness, honesty, authenticity, reliability, and solid, sound respectful caring of people (Marshall et al., 2022). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 107 Data Analysis      According to Denzin and Lincoln (2018), there is an assumption that data are primarily passive, inert, lifeless, disorganized, wait to be collected, processed, and vivified-awakened to meaning through methodic procedures; they are subservient to the work of analysis and interpretation. The construct of data as mute, brute, passive, inert, lifeless, simple, and concrete contrasts with its abstract entities that data help generate meaning, information, knowledge, evidence, concepts, or arguments, argues Denzin and Lincoln. The authors argued that data alone are insufficient and subject to analysis to render them fit for consumption. Hence comes data analysis. Data analysis involves organizing the data, coding, organizing themes, and representing and interpreting the data (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Data analysis is usually divided into exploratory and confirmatory types (Robson & McCartan, 2016). As the name suggests, exploratory analysis explores the data to determine its meaning. The confirmatory analysis focuses on whether the researcher got what was expected to be found (e.g., based on theory, predicting a servant leader's behavior toward diversity). Equipped with data sets, the researcher, regardless of the research design, must start with an exploration of the data, according to Robson & McCartan. This initial data analysis step will give the researcher a feeling for what the data tell. For a case study, the analysis consists of a detailed description of the case and its setting, posit Creswell & Poth. Suppose the studied case presents a chronology of events; in such a case, the authors recommend analyzing the multiple data sources to determine evidence for each step or phase in the evolution of the case. The rigor, duration, and data analysis procedures depend on the study's purpose, audience, and clarity about the purpose, argued Patton (1990). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 108 Qualitative Analysis      Qualitative inquiry aims to produce findings through data collection, which is not an end in itself; the ultimate goal of qualitative inquiry is to analyze, interpret, and present findings (Patton, 1990). Qualitative data analysis involves assigning codes or themes to a set of field notes, interview transcripts, documents, questionnaires results, and memos that symbolize or translate data and attribute meaning to each individual datum, and later looking for patterns, categorizing, asserting, theory building and using other analytic processes (Miles et al., 2020; Vogt et al., 2014, p. 13). For this particular case study, the researcher used NVivo to describe, evaluate, interpret, and analyze data from interviews, surveys, notes, and social events. The researcher used this software package to explore the meaning of data sets and recast them to find patterns and ways to display the information. NVivo is considered one the best software for analyzing qualitative data for indexing, searching, and theorizing, transforming data from field notes, interview transcripts, documents, and other empirical materials, as Miles et al. (2020) found out. The NVivo software package assisted the researcher in condensing the data - meaning expressing the data in fewer words concisely. According to Miles and colleagues, data condensation is not separate from data analysis; it is a part of it and occurs continuously throughout the life of any qualitative research-oriented project. According to the authors, further episodes of data condensation occur as data collection proceeds, such as writing summaries, coding, generating categories, developing themes, and writing memos. The researcher in this case study decided which data units to code and which to pull out. Made decisions about the labels for categorization to best summarize several codes, based on Miles and al. (2020) analytical choices, to sort, sharpen, focus, and organize data to allow a final verifiable conclusion. But the focus of data analysis of qualitative research comes from evaluating the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 109 research questions constructed at the beginning of the inquiry process during the conceptual framework design. Archival data documents gathered during fieldwork can be analyzed and used to corroborate and provide evidence of trends, for example, in diversity management practices within site. Analysis for Triangulation      According to Billups (2019), findings must appear truthful in the quest for qualitative result credibility. Qualitative researchers must use the required processes to apply credibility and evaluate findings: prolonged engagement, peer debriefing, and triangulation. Triangulation is a method of confirming results by showing that at least three independent measures support the findings or at least do not contradict them (Miles et al., 2020). According to Patton (1990), the triangulation strategy pays off in the data analysis process. In this case study, the researcher used methods triangulation and data triangulation based on different data collection methods and different data sources within the investigation, such as documents, interviews, and surveys. With triangulation, a researcher may get corroboration from several sources to enhance the trustworthiness of the analysis or get inconsistent or even directly conflicting findings, which can push the researcher to examine the integrity of the data collection methods closely and to explain why the conflicting results exist (Miles et al., 2020). One Logic of triangulation is to use findings from one type of study to check against the conclusions deriving from the other type (e.g., the results of a qualitative investigation might be checked against a quantitative analysis), according to Blaxter et al. (2010). Creswell and Poth (2018) suggest triangulation of multiple data sources, methods, and investigators to corroborate evidence or establish credibility. According to Miles et al. (2020), triangulation may enable researchers to get corroboration from multiple data sources to enhance the trustworthiness of the data analysis and push for close examination of the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 110 integrity of the data collection methods (qualitative or quantitative) and the integrity of the data itself. Summary of Data Analysis       Data analysis involves data organization, coding the data, finding patterns, using triangulation to validate the findings, and more. Data analysis helps make sense of data sets using software programs, such as CAQDAS, to sort and find patterns to help generate meaning. Triangulation seeks credibility for the findings using methods, data, or participants. Data analysis is commonly divided into exploratory and confirmatory types, each focusing on exploring the data for the former and predicting findings for the latter. Qualitative data analysis involves assigning codes or themes to data sets, such as field notes, transcripts, documents, questionnaire responses, and memos. Researchers use many established approaches to qualitative analysis. Following are common data analysis practices: Assigning codes or themes to field notes, interview transcripts, and documents, data sorting to identify similar phrases, relationships between constructs, patterns, categories, themes, and differences between concepts, and isolating the patterns and taking them out to the field in the next wave of data collection, assert (Miles et al., 2020). The challenge for all qualitative data analysis is finding coherent descriptions and explanations considering all gaps, inconsistencies, and contradictions inherent in personal and social life, posit Miles et al. On top of data analysis difficulties, researchers must face the intricacies of dealing with the ethical demand requirements of good practitioners and call for adherence to ethical qualitative research. Reliability and Validity      Reliability and validity are the confirmation and cornerstones of all research studies. The concept of validity has been controversial in qualitative research because many researchers see it STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 111 tied to quantitative assumptions, which is inappropriate for qualitative research, asserts Maxwell (2013). However, Irwin (2008) posits that validity threats are made implausible by evidence, not methods because methods are only a way of getting evidence to help rule out the threats. The realist view is that validity should not be tied to methods. Researchers propose other concepts appropriate for qualitative research, such as trustworthiness, authenticity, and quality (e.g., Guba & Lincoln, 1989; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; cf. Denzin & Lincoln, 2005a). Kirk and Miller (1986) stated that \"reliability depends essentially on explicitly described observational procedures.\" However, it is helpful to distinguish several kinds of reliability (which this text will not describe; See Kirk and Miller, 1986). These reliabilities are quixotic reliability, diachronic reliability, and synchronic reliability. Reliability.       Qualitative studies have been shadowed by the threat of the quantitative method and its claims for rigor and Reliability. From a constructivist point of view advocated by the researcher of this case study, reliability encompasses trustworthiness and authenticity (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018). While reliable as a mechanical process, its content analysis may raise validity issues; however, it may prove to be an effective, well-designed triangulation strategy when used in mixed-method, according to Denzin and Lincoln. During analysis, criteria of reliability and validity are crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of qualitative research. One way to do so during coding is to check intercoder reliability multiple times throughout the project for consistent reliability (Bernard, 2011).      Researchers must engage in focused, critical, systematic sense-making concerning their empirical research for reliability by questioning themselves as to what extent assumptions were made in the design phase about what was important or relevant to the study supported by the data STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 112 (Ravitch & Riggan, 2017), or what blind spots have been overlooked? What alternative interpretations or explanations exist for what the investigator sees in the data? What issues of validity or trustworthiness are emerging, and how is the researcher engaging with and addressing them? How does the researcher's identity and positionality - psychological, social, and institutional - influence the research process? What disconfirming evidence can the researcher find that challenges the current understanding and interpretations of the data? From the preceding statements, one can confidently conclude that reliability rests primarily on the researcher's shoulder for any study (Ravitch & Riggan, 2017). Validity.      Validity is the final component of the research design, and the dilemma is there is no way to \"beam up\" to valid conclusions, says Maxwell (2013). The validity of the research results is not acquired by following some standard procedures and is not a commodity either that can be purchased, as (Brinberg & McGrath 1985) put it. Instead, it depends on the relationship of your conclusions to reality, and no standard road map can completely assure that validity has been captured. However, as a researcher, one has an obligation to ensure some validity to their findings as much as possible to allow other researchers to follow the same steps and replicate the process.      According to Marshall et al. (2022), discourse on validity in qualitative research offers a range of alternatives, including credibility, participant review, and crystallization as arguments that the study was conducted rigorously, transparently, and ethically. Crystallization, a concept from Richardson (1997), provides a flexible way of thinking about validity because triangulation for validity has been critiqued as a rigid structure with fixed points, while crystals reflect externalities and refract within themselves, offering multiple perspectives. According to Marshall STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 113 et al., conceptualizing validity through the lens of crystals calls for a methodology that demands self-critique or self-reflexivity (p. 53). However, Ellington (2009) warns about these evolving terms and the evolving purposes of qualitative studies as the debate on validity continues with confusing choices for writers. Bracketing.      Bracketing is to capture the interplay between discursive practice and discourses in practice (Denzin & Lincoln, 2018); this process of oscillating indifference to the construction and realities of everyday life is called analytic bracketing (Gubrium & Holstein, 1997). Researchers attempt to capture data on participants' perceptions from the inside through deep attentiveness, empathetic understanding, and suspension or bracketing of preconceptions about the topics under discussion (Miles et al., 2020). Analytic bracketing is employed throughout, and as analysis proceeds, the researcher orients to realities as both the products of members' reality-constructing procedures and the resource from which facts are reflexively constructed. According to Dörfler & Stierand (2020), bracketing is a conceptualized researcher's attempt to hold their pre-understanding and assumptions to attain experiences before making sense of them. Researchers use bracketing as a source of additional insights to clarify research findings. Still, it can mean different things to different people based on the philosophical concepts one applies to it. In this particular case study, the researcher used bracketing as an analytical strategy for organizing data and breaking it down into homogeneous blocks within processes with a degree of unity to be able to describe them in depth while considering how the context affects the operations, as defined by Mills et al. (2010). STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 114 Summary of Reliability and Validity.      Reliability is the degree to which the research discovery is independent of accidental circumstances of the research; validity is the degree to which the finding is interpreted correctly and rarely involves identical observations but rather observations that are consistent with the particular features of interest to the observer (Kirk & Miller, 1986). The validity and reliability of qualitative data depend on the researcher's methodological skills, sensitivity, and integrity, argues Patton (1990). The use of validity to refer to the correctness, and credibility of a description, interpretation, and explanation of an account, according to Maxwell (2013), is consistent with its use in qualitative research and as a way to avoid any severe philosophical problems. As Campbell (1988) and Putman (1990) argued, one does not need an observer-independent gold standard to which one can compare their accounts for validity; moreover, the concepts of validity threats that one might be wrong with their findings are conceptualized as rival hypotheses. Non-qualitative research's description of reliability and validity rarely seems appropriate or relevant to qualitative research. Summary of Section 2 and Transition      The researcher of this study investigated the lack of leadership strategy in managing diversity resulting in the inability of organizations to make strategic changes to gain a competitive advantage in the era of rapidly shifting demographics. This single case study with a flexible design approach is a work in progress that can adapt as research on this topic continues to evolve. It is an exploratory and descriptive case study that stresses the importance of the context of the event, the setting, and the subjects in the study. This study was conducted with mindfulness in gaining informed consent that protects participants' privacy and confidentiality from harm or deception and by selecting participants equitably so that individuals are fairly STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 115 included or excluded from the research. The researcher in this study used multiple sources, techniques, and theories to provide and substantiate evidence. The researcher developed interviews, collected data, and synthesized and integrated the insights using methods appropriate for conducting a qualitative case study. When gathering information, these methods and other procedures were carried out with discipline and the researcher's ontological assumptions.      The researcher conducted interviews and surveys to follow up on off-hand remarks made by an interviewee that suggested relevant hypotheses. The researcher used theories and constructs to build interview questions about diversity management in organizations; inference during data collection to learn about the facts that were the subjects of the research questions, theories, and hypotheses. Bracketing, reflexivity, and transparency will maintain a positive participant-research rapport, prevent potential participant-researcher tensions, and maximize awareness. The participants were chosen for their knowledge and experience about the problem, including executive leaders, team leaders, and subordinates. They represent a variety of demographics, including men and women of different identities, religious backgrounds, and age differences in social settings. These employees made a difference or influenced decisions about managing diversity practices in the organization within which the population and sample were selected. The researcher used a nonprobability sampling approach, particularly purposive sampling, combined with probability sampling focusing on homogenous and critical case sampling. In this qualitative case study, the researcher addressed several subjects related to leadership strategy for managing diversity in the workplace. The researcher aims to contribute to the fundamental knowledge and theories for understanding how the business world operates by formulating problem-solving programs and interventions in managing diversity. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 116 Section 3: Application to Professional Practice and Implications for Change      This study was conducted for organizational leaders seeking to take diversity management to the next level as a corporate strategy using a data-driven qualitative approach, data analysis, and statistics to detect patterns and select evidence interventions to advance workplace inclusion behaviors, as described by Mattingly et al. (2022) in their study. The data gathered in this study were coded and analyzed using NVivo. Diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) can be learned through data gathering used as empirical evidence to show the impact or lack thereof of DEI efforts on people in organizations, posit Mattingly et al. (2022). Globalization in the 21st century, according to (Ghemawat & Altman, 2019), has been shaped by a war between economic fundamentals and policy threats, predicting a collapse with a wave of economic nationalism despite globalization has become a reality. Today the workplace of organizations around the globe is flooded with workers from all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Nations in Africa, where this study took place, are no exception to the rule imposed by globalization. \"Globalization is at the forefront of the contestation of the prospective evolution of culture, whether spoken about as a catalyst for cultural unity or cultural division, according to (Castañeda & Shemesh, 2020, p. 15). The following paragraphs will discuss the leadership practice and implementation strategies requiring organizational structural change. Overview of the Study      The general problem studied is the lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity in organizations, resulting in the inability of organizations to make strategic changes to gain a competitive advantage in the era of rapidly shifting demographics. The research questions in this study help set the boundaries and give direction in gathering data from the participants from this West African organization. The study participants successfully answered questions exploring the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 117 success and failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity. The answers to the research questions could address the specific problem or possible inability to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity within this West African organization in the technology industry, resulting in decreased workers' job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities in senior leadership positions.       The research used a semi-structured interview and a survey for the data collection. For the survey, SurveyMonkey was used to send a link to the survey respondents to complete the questionnaires. For the interview, the researcher used ZOOM and was able to record both the video and the audio. The H.R. director also provided organizational documents related to their practices of managing a diverse workforce. The interview questions and survey questionnaires are all related to the research questions. Using both data collection methods helps triangulate the data to understand the phenomenon comprehensively. This qualitative research study was conducted in West Africa. The organization that participated in the study operates in the security industry. Fifteen employees who participated in the study worked in the following positions:  One participant was the director of H.R., three participants were supervisors, one was the assistant to the H.R. director who granted access to the employees and organizational documents, another was an assistant to the CEO, a chief accountant, a security chief, one personnel chief, a commercial manager, a production manager, a steward, two cleaning employees, two suppliers, and three subordinates. Presentation of the Findings      The changing workforce in organizations worldwide, including those in Africa, makes managing diversity a critical issue that must be a part of any organizational business strategy. This study took place in Africa, and 15 participants from this West African organization STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 118 responded to survey questionnaires and participated in a semi-structured interview. The interview included questions about the driving force and the evolution of the organization's diversity programs and how the leaders in this organization define success concerning workplace diversity. The interviews yielded themes the participants and the researcher in the study think can improve leaders' capabilities in managing a diverse workforce. In part of their interview sessions, participants 1 and 2 thought a leader's cultural competency guides their understanding and effectiveness in managing diversity. A thematic analysis of the interviews, survey respondents' data, and organizational documents identified challenges and opportunities to achieve diverse workforce organizational goals. Among these challenges is implementing policies to advance an organization's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts to address the possible failure to create a leadership strategy for managing diversity within this Western African technology industry, resulting in decreased workers' job satisfaction, retention, organizational success, and representation of women and minorities in senior leadership positions. This qualitative case study explored the success and failure of leadership strategies in managing diversity in organizations and the adverse effects globalization, and ethnocentrism might have in managing diversity in the workplace. The themes described in the following paragraphs are the results of descriptive answers from participants' interviews and survey questionnaires. The interviews and questionnaires were based on the research questions that set the boundaries around this specific organization in West Africa. The research paradigm uses a constructive and transformative framework to study the named organization above in which diversity in the workplace has become a reality because of the global business environment. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 119 Overview of Themes Discovered      This research is a case study with a flexible method for collecting data using interviews, surveys, archival documents, field notes, and memos to gather information and analyze the data to find meanings related to the studied topic. The participants are employees working for an organization in the Western African region that relies on technology to run their business. For this study of Strategic Leadership for Managing Diversity, the themes discovered include (a) Leadership Behavior for Managing Diversity, (b) Leadership to Empower a Diverse Workforce, (c) Employee sense of belonging, (d) Ethnocentrism and diversity management, (e) Executive role in Managing diversity, (f) Inclusion in the workplace, (g) Diversity, and Innovation, (h) Globalization and the Management of Diversity, (i) Consequences of Diversity in the Workplace, (j) Cultural Competency and the Management of Diversity (k) CEOs Cultural competency. The most frequent themes originated from all 15 participants interviewed or surveyed. The participants, the actors, include an H.R. director, supervisors, an assistant to the H.R. director, another assistant to the CEO, a chief accountant, a security chief, a commercial manager, a production manager, a steward, cleaning employees, suppliers, and their subordinates. Discussion of Themes Theme: Leadership Behaviors for Managing Diversity      This theme aligns with the concept Leadership Behaviors Positively or Negatively Affect Diversity and is supported by the experiences discussed by participants working as members of a diverse workforce. Participants 1 and 6 addressed the need for leaders to be humble to show others they care about them during their interview sessions. House et al. (2004) defined humble leaders as humane-oriented leaders. These leaders are straightforward and compassionate and help support team members humanly. According to House and colleagues, these leaders are STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 120 modest and present themselves as humble and unassuming. Participant 11, during the interview, insisted on how leaders need to treat all equally and encourage everyone to get along in the workplace regardless of differences based on gender, race, and ethnicity by welcoming diversity openly and implementing team bonding exercises. Bowes (2021) expands this idea by saying organizations now started to realize that hiring-based diversity is not enough; inclusive policies and practices must take diversity a step further by making sure everyone is treated with equity and protected from discrimination and prejudice. During the interviews, participants 13 and 3 stressed the leaders' honesty and transparency in delivering on promises by saying: “Leaders must be open-minded, willing to listen to different viewpoints, respect their workers, and not differentiate based on functions or demographics because everyone contributes their efforts to the organization; they must be good role models for their employees.” Bowes (2021) also explored leadership in diversity and inclusion and found that leaders must improve transparency throughout their organizations to ensure people have access to information, transparency that allows people to call out issues and worry less about their comments. They also must be honest without sugarcoating the reality of situations and be frank about conversations about the policies that affect others. Leaders of a diverse workforce must learn about their employees by listening to them because if they do, the employees will listen too, which can enhance effectiveness. When employees are heard and valued, they become motivated, according to some of the participants. See Table 10. What are the Leadership Behaviors for Managing Diversityand Table 11. Leaders' behaviors influence the management of diversity. for the themes and survey responses from participants.      This theme aligns with the construct 'Transformational Leadership Empowers and Motivates Employees.' The theme focuses on global leaders' role in influencing and advancing workplace STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 121 inclusion. The analysis of this theme provides insights into the strategies managers need to manage diversity. However, these strategies are based on the specific company's data with the understanding that every organization is different and what diverse data they collect about their workforce. During the interviews and surveys, most of the participants in this study thought leaders must possess compassion, understand others and their backgrounds, be less judgmental, and show openness to new experiences. During the interview, according to participant 11, \"for leaders to empower their diverse workforce, they need an environment of serenity and pay attention to those they lead with listening ears.\" Serenity is a state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled. Having this positive state of mind ameliorates a workforce's well-being because the members of this group will not be troubled by an alternating period of life's good and bad feelings. According to DuBrin (2013), the values in leaders' culture influence their behaviors and the behaviors of others as well. The values programmed in the leaders' minds affect relationships between people in society and organizations, Hofstede (1999, pp. 35-37). During an interview, participant 12 thought that \"leaders need to authorize employees to do their job based on their schedules, which will motivate them to do their work the best way possible conscientiously.\" Still, this participant is stretching it to the extreme because giving employees that much freedom may have unexpected consequences.       Other participants, during the interviews and responses from the survey, agree that to empower their employees, leaders need not pressure workers; they must grant access and opportunities to the aggrieved racial minorities, reach out to everyone, genuinely listen to ideas and make everyone feel important. Leaders must direct employees to the correct action steps required for doing their best, influence systemic changes, and make everyone feel wanted. Leaders must lead confidently and respectfully toward their employees and be veridic using STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 122 sincere communication, said participant 15 during an interview. According to some participants, managers must have an equal outlook on all ethnicities, ages, and gender differences. These participants also recognized that leaders who empower their employees promote them to higher organizational positions based on their performance. Managing a diverse workforce requires leaders to be less judgmental, not see color, trust all employees, recognize their efforts, and tell them the truth, posited participants 1 and 4 during the interviews. Leaders must empower their diverse workforce by making risk neutrality part of organizational culture (Moore & Bazerman, 2022). By doing so, they will view deviations from risk neutrality as mistakes rather than personal choices and not punish employees for unfortunate outcomes. As a leader of a diverse workforce, emphasis added, hire better people and discriminate less in the process, argued Moore and Bozerman. Participant 7 said during interviewing, \"Leader needs to listen to their employees because if a leader does not listen, he cannot discuss with their subordinates and would not be able to know much about them; Participants 8 and 9 said during their interviews: There needs to be open communication; with communication flowing between employees and leaders, any confusion can be defused and all obstacles removed. Leaders must tell the truth and do what they said they would do, act with dignity, and always be close to their employees. Communicating and knowing your employees also manifest themselves between black and white; the leader, from a black or white race, must take time to understand their employees. When you employ someone, you need to put that individual in good working conditions so they can see themselves in their work.  Focusing on one's skin color instead of their skills in a workplace is a formula for failure, responded participant 14 in the survey. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 123 Theme: Employee sense of belonging      This theme aligns with the anticipated, discovered theme of 'Inclusive Leadership,' a leadership behavior that provides employees with a sense of belonging in the workplace while maintaining their uniqueness and contributing to organizational outcomes positively. According to several participants in this study, human's purpose is to belong because employees spend most of their time at work where they want a sense of community. They think it is essential for everyone to feel welcome, and when leaders do not care or pay attention to diversity, it is most likely to breed ignorance. Employees are more fulfilled to work alongside people who share the same goals and feel part of something. Everyone wants to be liked and accepted at work, where they spend most of their time away from their families. \"Everyone has a sense of belonging and fitting, and belonging is like a human instinct,\" said participant 12 during an interview. For some participants, employees want more than just to be paid; they want a place of work where they feel wanted and connect and learn from others. They want to belong because why else would they be there, said participant 15. Working with diverse teams increases the frictional forces that require more engagement and energy; in encounters with others, people have a spontaneous reaction that is part of natural human behavior, triggered by unconscious bias, Altmikus et al. (2022). Tooled with specific processes and mindsets, organizations can leverage the potential for innovation, performance, and an increased sense of belonging that diversity yields, posit the authors.       According to participant 15, employees want to belong to a good company that treats them fairly, and being accepted by others is very important. People are created differently, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to fit in and blend with others, posits participant 2. Leaders must take appropriate actions when there is favoritism based on group membership and make STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 124 everyone feel comfortable around one another and enjoy coming to work. Employees need to know there is room for growth because it is motivating when appreciated and valued, echo several participants. Theme: Ethnocentrism and Diversity Management      This theme focuses on and aligns with the construct of Ethnocentrism, Nationalism, and Exclusiveness. The debate on ethnocentrism and nationalism has gained the front line in the media and is a contested issue with anti-immigrant policy and rhetoric from both sides. Participant 12 thought that what matters in the workplace is the employees doing their job as required; he did not believe globalization influences ethnocentrism. Respondent 9 in the survey felt that ethnocentrism could lead to stereotyping and misunderstanding and can spin a preconceived negative feeling. In contrast, other participants pointed out that ethnocentrism makes managing diversity more critical and complex and can create horrible environmental conditions. These participants thought ethnocentrism is the polar opposite of diversity; it disallows diversity to flourish and creates an inefficient environment where too little is insufficient to meet sufficient demands. Mixed results were received when analyzing respondents' responses to a survey concerning globalization and its influence on ethnocentrism; 46.7% of respondents agreed, 40% disagreed, and 13.3% strongly agreed. See the SPSS 'Descriptive Statistics Frequencies'. See Table 20. Globalization may influence for the survey responses, Theme: Executive roles in managing diversity.      Women at the top of the corporate hierarchy impact business performance and gender diversity as a solution to increase the quality of managing diversity, according to Moreno-Gómez et al. (2018). This theme aligns with the construct 'Top Executive can Promote Diversity' and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 125 focuses on top executives' role in setting the company's culture and policies that could impact workplace diversity management. Several survey respondents believed the executive roles include setting the vision and overarching policies and guidelines for the company, setting the company culture, and what is acceptable. They should find diversity in the workplace critical and essential. According to participant 6 in the survey, executives must ensure the company is a supportive workplace for diversity where employees' contributions to organizational success are not underestimated. They must treat their employees equally and respectfully and ensure hiring managers recruit employees from diverse groups. In the interview, participant 4 thought that executives must \"hire from diverse groups of people, treat all people equally without singling anyone or any group out, and influence the promotion of employees are some of their roles.\" Participant 8 thought that executives must find the right people and replicate hood values despite needing to hire outside their comfort zones. This comment was from a survey questionnaire. Not everyone sees diversity as a good thing in the workplace, and they sure have their reasons for supporting their arguments. A recent study by Ernst and Young in 2017 found that one-third of Americans surveyed said that the corporate focus on diversity had overlooked white men, and 62 percent of Ernst and Young survey respondents believe that white men are being overlooked for promotion and other job opportunities. However, organizations must let their white male employees, with their backlash too often the byproduct of diversity effort, know that the co-workers they hire are competent and do not jeopardize their careers (Crosby & Clayton, 1990; Gottfredson, 1992; Solomon, 1992). See Table 3 What strategic role do top executives play in promoting diversityabout this theme. Theme: Inclusion in the workplace STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 126      Inclusive leadership creates a work habit that allows employees to help one another, get closer, and communicate well between leaders and their employees. This theme aligns with the construct of inclusion in the workplace; several participants thought that diversity and inclusion should be integrated into strategic planning and infused into policy and practices using surveys or other ways to let everyone have a say. They believed that inclusive leadership would make team members feel that their opinions are essential no matter where they come from and their status in the company. They also agreed that when you are an inclusive leader, you include and accept everyone as a member; when you are inclusive, you often talk to your employees and instill in their practices inclusivity. Participant 12 pointed out that their manager takes inclusion seriously, making everyone feel equal and welcomed. The more inclusive you are, the more diverse the workplace will become. A leader must act by bringing all employees to work seriously as a team and in fairness and recognize everyone's contribution. If employees come together as people, according to participant 4, they can do almost anything. But not everyone thinks the same way about inclusion in the workplace; participant 5 mentioned that although there is diversity, camaraderie exists based on people belonging to the same ethnic group. See Table 12. What do you think of inclusion in the concerning this theme. Theme: Globalization and the Management of Diversity      This theme aligns with the construct of globalization and the management of diversity. Globalization changes individuals' mentality and allows them to gather new ideas and perspectives by furthering open-mindedness and goodwill. Participants acknowledged the increase of diversity in the workplace because of it; they thought that globalization expands diversity and comes with benefits in new knowledge acquisition. Participant 4 said, \"globalization is good because you can learn from people from different countries, especially STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 127 those from developed countries,\" during an interview. This guy understands what globalization can bring to society when people are global-minded and not strangled by ethnocentrism. One employee, participant 1, thought globalization might seem threatening because it makes an already complex diversity more challenging and may cause intragroup conflicts. Participant 5 said in the interview that \"globalization has negative implications because people from elsewhere will take jobs that should go to residents. An African proverb says: \"I am not unwelcoming, but I do not need to see many hands on the dinner table.\" That, indeed, are some of the consequences of globalization that can lead to ethnocentric behaviors in the workplace.      Similarly, another employee, participant 6, thought globalization affects workplace diversity but did not believe ethnocentrism exists in West Africa. Based on what is known, ethnocentrism is everywhere, and one individual opinion cannot be generalized to the whole population. The most well-intentioned organizational leaders are often encumbered by their ethnocentric viewpoints and need help appreciating and incorporating new and different values and ideas (Lindsay, 1993). They may also feel ambivalent about altering the very system in which their careers flourished and sticking with the status quo. There are hurdles outside the executive suite, too. Promoting diversity in a strong culture where traditional employees perceive projected changes as disturbing their familiar arrangements may be challenging. Tsui et al. (1992) reported that whites and males responded negatively to the increased presence of non-whites and females in their work units. See Table 14. What consequences does globalization have on the management of diversity for more about this theme. Theme: Cultural Competency and the Management of Diversity      This theme aligns with the construct cultural competency is necessary because people bring their cultural beliefs to the workplace, according to some participants in this study. They thought STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 128 that knowing about cultural differences guides your understanding of diversity. Learning about employees' culture is suitable for leading a diverse workforce because it allows you to understand the individual rapidly, according to participant 15. This same participant thought that leaders' understanding of their employee's culture to be able to lead them could be problematic if they want to lead and, at the same time, make decisions based on everyone's culture. Managers will have difficulty guiding their employees to the right path by not understanding their cultures. Participant 4 thought understanding other's cultures could help leaders effectively manage a diverse workforce because the experience would teach them about others and how to lead them. Participant 8 went further by saying that having cultural competency helps leaders access an individual's beliefs much more quickly because they are tuned to their way of doing things based on their cultural beliefs. See Table 6. What cultural competencies do leaders need to manage and Table 7. The cultural competency of leaders is a necessity for understanding concerning this theme and the survey responses from the participants. Theme: CEO's Cultural Beliefs and Moral Values       A leader's moral values and ethics are critical in managing diversity or any other group. This theme aligns with the construct the leader's moral value and ethics is a reference, an example of a model that can aid the leader in understanding diversity. According to participant 15, the leadership's moral values can affect employees negatively because corrupt leaders can influence their workers to follow the same path they are following. For example, a good leader must not promote discrimination and ensure that everyone in the workplace gets along with others; in contrast, leaders with discriminatory behaviors can make their employees feel uncomfortable, especially members of a diverse workforce (Participant 4). On the opposite spectrum, participant 3 thought that even with cultural beliefs and moral values, leaders must comprehend diversity to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 129 lead a diverse workforce. See Table 4. How do CEOs' moral values contribute to workplace diversity managementand Table 5. Leaders' moral values have an impact on diversity management.to learn more about this theme and the survey responses. Theme: Consequences of Diversity in the Workplace      This theme aligns with the construct of the consequences of diversity in the workplace, including certain employees' tendency to see diversity as a way to exclude the dominant group. Participant 10 thought that diversity in skill sets is more important than diversity based on race or skin color and is propaganda spread by organizations to keep people in check. Meanwhile, another employee, participant 13, pointed to the fact that corporate cultural inertia, racism, and white supremacy to exclude certain races bring to the surface some consequences of diversity in the workplace. A diverse workforce can lead to miscommunication between team members and is one of its consequences, posited participant 7. A more optimistic participant 4 thought employing a diverse workforce could lead to excellent teamwork and a great work environment. See Table 17. What are the consequences of diversity in the workplace?  Theme: Diversity and Innovation      This theme aligns with the construct of diversity and innovation. According to participants in this study, when people from different backgrounds, viewpoints, and knowledge meet, they can create many possibilities that could lead to innovation because they can examine problems with different foci. During an interview, a female, participant 9, believed that \"women bring more innovation than men in organizations because they are more tuned in how things are done and create an environment with an ambiance of a family while men do not have time for that.\" Participant 5 indicated in the interview that \"diversity in the workplace is necessary for a company's high performance and innovation, and that people from different backgrounds have STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 130 different perspectives and ideas about ways of doing things said another participant.\" Diversity encourages and stimulates innovation when everyone brings their cultural knowledge and various ideas; when these ideas are assembled, they can create new things and progresses. According to participant 6, people with different perspectives and multiple ideas must collaborate and pull in the same direction; if not, if some dig and others fill in, it will not work. Workers in a team need to have the same vision and tell the truth to one another. Participant 7 said during an interview, \"when people from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities get together and work, it is not by accident; it is something God has planned.\" For those who believe in God, everything in life has a purpose. See Table 21. Does diversity in teams stimulate innovation?and Table 22. Diversity in a team helps stimulate innovation.for more regarding this theme and the survey responses. Summary      The 11 themes described in the preceding pages are the most appropriate for exploring leaders' strategies to implement and manage workforce diversity in organizations to address the general and specific problem of a lack of leadership in managing diversity. These themes range from the executives' roles and commitments to fostering diversity and inclusion; the leaders’ cultural competencies and beliefs in promoting diversity in the workplace; the consequences of globalization and ethnocentrism in the promotion of diversity in organizations; the CEO’s moral values and leadership behaviors most sought to move the needle in the right direction and their contributing factors in the management of a diverse workforce. The themes align with what these employees experienced within a diverse workforce. The personal practical experiences of the participants in this West African organization gave insights into what they thought was the cause of the lack of a leadership strategy for managing diversity. A deficiency that is not unique to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 131 Africa but exists globally in today’s business environment. When the participants are surveyed and asked how can leader's behaviors enhance the effective management of diversity? 93.4% of respondents said that leaders need to be more open-minded, and their behavior must be welcoming. They must treat everyone with the same amount of respect and be equally valued and accepted. For what leaders are doing is an example for others too. Relationships of Findings      The relationships of the findings to critical areas of the research proposal touch on understanding leadership decisions and the benefits and negative aspects of diversity in the workplace. These relationships also touch on the operations and procedures leaders use to promote diversity and inclusion in organizations, top executives' roles in implementing such strategies and policies, and the leadership behaviors required for creating a working environment where a diverse workforce strives for organizational objectives. The findings addressed each research question by asking relevant questions to help set boundaries and focus the researcher's efforts on gathering data using semi-structured interviews and surveys as the study’s methods. The answers to the research questions ranged from asking participants about their knowledge of executives' roles and their moral values that could contribute to workplace diversity management. These research questions are descriptive and open-ended and align with the purpose statement by restating the purpose of the study in more specific terms. Similarly, the survey questionnaires used a similar format for triangulation in this study by comparing the data from the two methods, the interviews and the survey.       The findings based on the research questions helped address the elements of the case for understanding leadership strategies for managing a diverse workforce. The results also provided a window for understanding the appropriate strategic approaches leaders need for managing STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 132 diversity. These approaches include integrating organizational mission and value statements in the planning strategy, the cultural competencies necessary for leaders to possess, and how CEOs' moral values and beliefs that can contribute to workplace diversity. A dozen research questions are asked to participants, coded using NVivo, and analyzed. For the survey questionnaires, SPSS is used to conduct a descriptive statistical analysis of the respondents' data. The researcher in this study is a graduate student; the participants were in West Africa and included supervisors, HR directors, and several of their subordinates. For a detailed list of all the NVivo codebook, see   Table 42. The NVivo Codebook in Appendix B. The codebook clarifies the meaning of the thematic codes applied to the data that helps share the findings. The Error!

Relationship of Findings to Research Questions RQ 1 was: What approach for managing diversity can be part of strategic planning? The relevant themes are derived from the subquestion RQ1a. What strategic role do top executives play in promoting diversity? The themes and their connections to the research question are listed in the table below. Table 2.

They influence their companies' cultural environment. They set the vision and overarching policies of organizations with highly dynamic leadership. According to participants 3 and 4, there is a need for highly dynamic leadership that supports a diverse workplace where everyone is treated equally. According to some of the participants in the study, CEOs with higher moral values display pro-diversity behavior. Still, CEOs’ words and actions alone are insufficient to implement diversity management practices, Ng & Sears (2020). They argued that HR managers must see their CEOs committed to workplace diversity for successful diversity management practices. Participant 8, responding to a survey questionnaire, thought that “the executive role is to find the right people by replicating hood values despite needing to hire outside their comfort zones.” This point of view, although controversial, is shared by some practitioners. The theoretical and empirical perspectives about the role of executives in promoting diversity in the workplace show that this topic is sensitive from many angles. The researcher also surveyed participants on how HR executives care about diversity management. 40% of the respondents agreed that HR executives tend to diversity; 33.3% disagreed, and 26.7% strongly agreed. The survey results reflect that some executive leaders are out of touch, as one participant in the study pointed out, see table below.

Reaching out to everyone, genuinely listening to ideas, etc., and working as a team make everyone feel important,” said participant 13 in the interview. Vargas-Solar et al. (2022) argued that inclusion is all about empowering people by respecting and appreciating what makes them different, that organizations need comprehensive actions and an empowering environment to reach a culture of equality, creating a playing field for opportunities, and an inclusive bias-free workplace. During an interview session, participant 15 in the study stated that for leadership to empower their diverse workforce, \"They must have confidence and respect toward their employees and veridic, sincere communication with them.\" Based on these mentioned theoretical and empirical evidence, in the context of West Africa, employees see respect and communication and granting access to information as the primary tools for managers to empower their teams. When asked survey participants if promoting diversity motivates team members, using SPSS 'Descriptive Statistics Frequencies,' 60% of respondents agreed that it does encourage the team, 6.7% disagreed, and 33.3% strongly agreed. The results show that promoting diversity in the workplace can be a part of empowering employees of a diverse workforce; see the result below. Table 9. Promoting diversity motivates team members.

He discovered that unethical behavior by elected officials and public managers suggests examining the causes and consequences of unethical leadership behavior in public organizations. Participant 1 in this study, during the interview, thought “leadership behaviors can lessen the efficacy of leading a diverse workforce, and to ease their management of diversity, they must show their team that they care about them because everyone values their identity and uniqueness.\" leaders must be honest and transparent delivering on promises, and willing to listen which can enhance their effectiveness and motivate others (participants 4, and 13).

STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 140      The Themes of globalization and the management of diversity examine the ever-changing demographics and their impact on the current workforce. According to participants 11 and 4, globalization expands diversity and its benefits, and the consequences of managing diversity may seem threatening to some and make a complex situation more challenging. Participant 5, in the study during the interview, said, \"globalization can change an individual's mentality with new ideas and perspectives that further occasion openness and goodwill.” The sad reality is that globalization has been linked for political reasons to increase immigration, diversity, and open borders (Castañeda & Shemesh, 2020). At the same time, globalization is defined as an increase in the proportion and impact of intercontinental over local or regional transactions, Tilly et al. (1995, pp. 1–2). The process of globalization in trade has been going on at various times throughout history, during colonialism and the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, posit Castañeda and Shemesh. The literature and theoretical evidence show that globalization influences workplace diversity because of people's global connectivity and technological advances. Survey data were collected by asking employees about globalization's consequences on managing diversity; mixed messages were received see the tables below. Table 15.

Check Table 18. Diversity is a source of team miscommunications in the  According to participant 10, skill sets are most important than diversity based on race. But for participant 13, corporate cultural inertia is the culprit for the consequences of diversity because of racism and white supremacy. As Lumineau et al. (2021) observed, International Business (IB) research has focused predominantly on separation, the negatives of diversity, and ignored disparity and the discriminatory consequences STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 142 of diversity; such a view of diversity creates an obstacle to implementing it, which aims at leveraging and celebrating diversity and achieving inclusion. Nevertheless, diversity management is perceived as strongly connected to the neoliberal turn in the UK and its fatal consequences for the public sector (Holvino & Kamp, 2009). The individual-group-based differences dilemma has implications; for example, focusing on individual differences leads to change strategies that ensure access and legitimacy for all, while focusing on group-based differences leads to the discrimination and fairness paradigm, argued Holvino and Kamp. The themes above show that diversity also has adverse side effects in organizations. See the table below. Table 18. Diversity is a source of team miscommunications in the workplace.

According to Miles et al. (2014), a conceptual framework is both a process and a product of analytic reflection. The theories in this framework that are studied based on this case study research include transformational, inclusive, and charismatic leadership styles. These theories and the constructs enable the researcher to gain knowledge about the topic of this study: Strategic Leadership for Managing Diversity. The constructs include Top executives can promote diversity which aligns with the research question STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 143 RQ1a What strategic role do top executives play in promoting diversity? Organizational moral values contribute to workplace happiness, which aligns with the research question RQ2 How do CEOs' moral values contribute to workplace diversity management? Transformational leadership empowers and motivates employees, which aligns with the research question RQ3 How do global leaders influence, motivate, and empower followers in the workplace? Ethnocentrism and nationalism are predictors of exclusiveness, which aligns with the research question RQ4 What consequences do globalization and ethnocentrism have in managing diversity?      The participants' individual experiences and observations helped visualize the events in the organization's environment using the documents the HR director provided and the data collected using interviews and surveys from the participants. The findings from the participants’ interviews and surveys gave viewpoints that describe the arguments why leadership strategy for managing diversity matters. The study examined the participants' views on the phenomenon by analyzing the themes generated from the interviews and surveys. These findings are the concepts and the presumed relationship among the themes driven by a system of assumptions, expectations, beliefs, and theories described by Maxwell (2013). The following paragraphs will review the theories and the constructs that concern this study. RQ4b was: What effect does ethnocentrism have in managing diversity? The relevant themes are listed in table 9 below, describing the connections between the themes and the participant’s answers to the research question. See Table below. Table 19.

Lousy condition for the environment Ethnocentrism is the polar opposite of diversity Disallow diversity to flourish An inefficient environment where too little is not enough to meet sufficient demands       Ethnocentrism is believed to be the polar opposite of diversity (Participant 2). Ethnocentrism disallows diversity to flourish by creating an atmosphere where more is needed to meet demand regarding diversity management. According to Dutton et al. (2016), ethnocentrism can display positive or negative signs. Positive ethnocentrism characterizes one’s pride in one’s ethnic group or nation and readiness to make sacrifices. In contrast, negative ethnocentrism exhibits prejudices and hostility towards other ethnic groups. According to participants 13 and 2, globalization influences ethnocentrism, leading to stereotyping and misunderstanding with a preconceived negative feeling, an awful condition for the working environment. Based on those mentioned theoretical and empirical pieces of evidence, it is clear that in West Africa, people also deal with ethnocentrism, even though one particular employee, participant 6, thought that ethnocentrism does not exist in Africa, which is one individual debatable opinion. The survey below shows the participants' responses about globalization's influence on ethnocentrism. Table 20. Globalization may influence ethnocentrism.

Does diversity in teams stimulate innovation? RQ. Does diversity in teams stimulate innovation?  Themes Points of connections Different perspectives Many possibilities Diversity in the workplace Gain new knowledge from others Collaborate Pull in the same direction       Diversity in the workplace is necessary for a company's high performance and innovation. According to (participants 1, 4, 5, and 9), when everyone brings their experiences and thoughts, that can stimulate innovation. According to these employees, when everyone brings their cultural knowledge and various ideas, and when these ideas are assembled, it can stimulate innovation. Participant 9 thought that women bring more innovation than men, so diversity is essential in creating many possibilities that could lead to innovation. Innovation is brought by an interactive process involving communication and interactions among employees, which creates friction and could lead to poorly thought-out actions by primarily well-intentioned executives who erred on one side or another (Østergaard et al., 2011; Sable, 2023).       However, innovation does not have to be an invention; it just must produce distinctive solutions; Kallet (2014) defined innovation and creativity as providing a new or modified conclusion that obtains a positive result. Innovation is not reserved for the select few who come up with brilliant new products and ideas; everyone can be innovative, especially when using STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 146 critical thinking as a foundation, argue Kallet. Studies show that diversity stimulates innovation in organizations. Diversity breeds various perspectives on subjects of concern related to job functions. It provides many possibilities for a diverse workforce to accomplish their duties with new knowledge when workers collaborate and pull in the same direction -review statistical survey frequencies from respondents concerning team diversity and how it can stimulate innovation. Responses from participants about diversity and innovation in the workplace show that 53.3% agreed positively to the questionnaire, and 46,7% strongly agreed with the statement.

But this will only be possible with inclusion, respect, and a genuine commitment from employees and their leaders to make a diverse workforce enjoyable and fulfilling. The participants in the study have provided important information about how they would see their leadership managing diversity based on the context of their organization. Africa is a different environment, but when it comes to managing diversity, the concepts are applied everywhere around the globe. Discovered Themes      The findings of this study are related to the anticipated themes, such as the roles HR executives play in promoting diversity in the workplace. The researcher had the opportunity to interview an HR director who also provided essential documents on how their organization manages diversity. The findings provided relevant information about inclusivity and how inclusive leadership can enhance employee sense of belonging and well-being in a diverse workforce. Several participants have contributed their viewpoints by indicating that it is human nature to belong, feel welcomed, be part of something, and be accepted at work, where they spend most of their time away from families. Two female participants brought up the upper echelon theory by saying that females bring more innovation than men in organizations because they can create an environment with a family ambiance, and males do not but are not allowed to advance in higher positions. One female (participant 3) also complained about not being provided opportunities to grow with promotion while she has worked there for over ten years. That is what Windscheid et al. (2017) described as the paradox of the upper echelons theory. The STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 148 theme below is an open-ended survey question that aligns with the anticipated theme of inclusive leadership. Table 24. Does Inclusive Leadership Minimize diversity's adverse effects? Does Inclusive Leadership Minimize diversity's adverse effects? Themes Points of connections Purpose to belong It is essential for everyone to feel welcome Feel part of something Everyone wants to be liked and accepted at work Connect and learn from others Employees want more than just to be paid; they want a place of work where they feel wanted            Inclusive leadership is behaviors that make employees feel part of something while retaining their sense of uniqueness, Shore et al. (2018). Randel et al. (2018) posit that inclusive leadership realizes positive outcomes through belongingness that benefits everyone because it engenders a connection, a natural human desire. When interviewed, participant 12 said, \"everyone wants to be liked and accepted because you spend half of your waking life at work.\"  The remarks from the theoretical and empirical pieces of evidence show that a sense of belonging is universal and embraces all cultures, whether your job is located in West Africa or any other part of the world. Inclusive leadership also minimizes diversity's adverse effects in the workplace based on survey responses from the participants in this study. In the survey questionnaire concerning inclusive leadership, respondents 66.7% said that inclusive leadership behaviors minimize the adverse effects of diversity, 6.7% of participants disagreed, and 26.7% strongly agreed that a sense of belonging promotes diversity. See the table below. Table 25. Inclusive leadership behaviors minimize diversity's adverse effects. Inclusive leadership behaviors minimize diversity's adverse effects.

The reason being these themes are not well-known in the African context. Even here in the West, these themes are not pervasive in the literature. Marques (2018), who the researcher believes coined the term\" \"Awakened Leadership\" in his book ‘Awakened Leadership: A Mindful Roadmap for Perpetual Design Thinking’ has no references page for the term. The same goes for the “social leadership” term used by (Guglielmo & Palsule, 2016) in their book ‘Social leader: Redefining leadership for the complex social age.’ These two concepts certainly need to be exploited for more insights. Relationship of Findings to The Literature The findings show that leaders must have confidence and respect for their employees and communicate with them sincerely. Participants in the study discussed themes concerning CEOs' moral values and how they can create a pro-diversity environment and implement diversity management practices. Some discovered themes examined the reality that employees want to be liked and accepted because they spend half their waking life at work. The themes also described inclusive leadership and how it can minimize diversity's adverse effects in the workplace by creating a culture where everyone contributes to their full potential, stimulating learning and a workforce relationship leading to achieving their strategic goals. Other themes examined the negative exhibitions of prejudices and hostility towards other ethnic groups by ethnocentrism. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 150 The Themes of globalization and the management of diversity examine the ever-changing demographics and their impact on the current workforce. According to some study participants, globalization expands diversity and its benefits. Cultural competency is also essential for knowing about cultural differences, which guides one's understanding of diversity, suitable for leading, and helping experience other cultures, said one participant. Cultural intelligence is the capability of an individual to function effectively in situations characterized by cultural diversity.  Different themes discussed the consequences of diversity in the workplace, including miscommunication between team members; for some people, skill sets are more important than diversity based on race. But for others, corporate cultural inertia is the culprit for the consequences of diversity. This qualitative study is consistent with prior research. It extends it by offering strategic leadership for managing diversity in the workplace based on information provided by the participants in this case study conducted in Africa. There are limitations worth mentioning. First, this study happened in West Africa and included only 15 participants. Nevertheless, it provides empirical evidence for understanding employees' feelings within a diverse workforce. Second, it offers managers for global organizations rushing to start a new venture in West Africa the knowledge they need before engaging in such an adventure. The literature findings concerning the strategy of managing diversity in organizations align with most of what the participants in the study experienced in this West African organization, as seen around the globe. The only difference contemplated is that most literature reviews about the management of diversity are conducted using quantitative analysis in contrast to a qualitative research methodology as done in this current study. Also, rare studies touch on the strategies necessary for managing diversity. Theme: Leadership Behaviors for Managing Diversity STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 151      According to (Asencio & Mujkic, 2016), Leaders need to be aware of their behaviors to build trust. When leaders display transformational leadership and ethical behavior, they encourage employees to view issues from new perspectives, engage in individualized consideration, and show concern for their employee's needs, which leads to more trust, posit Asencio and Mujkic. Participant 3 in the study said leaders must be good role models, respectfully talk to their employees, and encourage and recognize their efforts. Participant 8 enforced this logic by saying that a leader's moral values and ethics are a reference first, an example of a model that can aid the leader in understanding diversity. A study (Khan & Kalra, 2022) examined the effect of team diversity on perceived morality and found that it generalizes beyond the team. Their research also showed that the impact on perceived character is driven by diversity in the team rather than perceptions of other characteristics that differentiate the team members. Participants in the research responded to a survey concerning leadership behaviors. See the table below. Table 26. How can leaders' behaviors enhance the effective management of diversity?

They must treat everybody with the same amount of respect and be equally valued and accepted. 1 6.7 6.7 100.0 Total 15 100.0 100.0  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 152       This theme, therefore, aligns with what is found in the literature concerning the positive side of leadership behavior's impact on diversity. Leadership can be crucial in developing and sustaining an organization’s diverse workforce, and researchers have found positive relationships between leadership behaviors and organizational employee well-being. However, there is a significant difference in the methods used to collect and analyze the data. Both studies (Asencio & Mujkic, 2016) and (Khan & Kalra, 2022) used quantitative research with data collection methods and analysis compared to the qualitative research used in this case study, which is a significant difference. However, when one uses both methods for triangulation, these studies can provide more insights into the phenomenon of leadership behaviors for managing diversity. Still, one must not forget that destructive behaviors can lead in the opposite direction: negative consequences. Theme: Leadership that Empowers a Diverse Workforce      Cooper et al. (2020), in concert with Mountjoy (2019), stated that “safe sport can only occur if there is a change in the culture of sport to one where athletes are respected and empowered to speak and influence change” (p. 59). In the sports world, empowering athletes is crucial. However, leaders must possess compassion, an open mind, and an understanding of others' backgrounds, said participant 1 during the interview. Participants 11 and 5 thought leaders must do as much as possible to bring others up and ensure equal opportunities in an environment with good conditions, serenity in listening and communicating with their employees individually, and humility. This discussion happened during the interviewing sessions. Leaders must grant access and opportunities to underserved populations, direct them to the correct action steps, reach out to everyone, genuinely listen to ideas, etc., and work as a team to make everyone feel important and make the workers feel like they matter, posited participants 13 and 14 when interviewed. This STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 153 theme concerning Leadership that empowers a Diverse Workforce aligns with the findings from the participants and the literature review.      There is no better way to engage workers than to lift their spirits by empowering them. Empowering a team sport or employees in organizations has the same impact as giving employees what they need to excel in their work. Happy employees are empowered by their managers, especially those of a diverse workforce. Inclusion is about empowering groups or individuals with diverse backgrounds and respecting and appreciating what makes them different. Cooper et al. (2020) used a case study using interviews and focus groups for data collection. The findings from the participants in Africa and the findings from Cooper and colleagues’ analysis are aligned, and there are no known differences regarding results. Both studies from West Africa and Cooper and colleagues’ study found that it is essential for organizational leaders to empower their diverse workforce.      According to (Cox, 1991; Jackson et al. 1992; Morrison, 1992), to empower their employees and perform well in this global business environment, organizational structures, systems, and policies must recognize and nurture the inputs of every employee, discourage both prejudice and discrimination, rather than smother differences. But hiring diverse employees while organizational leaders are not endorsing multiculturalism and promoting uniqueness does not enhance creativity, decision-making, and flexibility in the workplace, and employees will be disappointed with their employers (Comer & Soliman, 1996; Caudron, 1993). \"When differences are not understood, heterogeneity can lead to confusion, low cohesiveness, and low productivity\" (Adler, 1991, as quoted by Comer & Soliman, 1996, p. 4). Theme: Employee sense of belonging STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 154      Lambert et al. (2013) found that a sense of belonging correlates positively with a sense of belonging and meaningfulness. But they also found that it is possible to have positive relationships, satisfying the need to belong in a general sense, yet still not feeling that one is entirely accepted. In other words, meeting public demand for positive social relationships - for instance, being part of a diverse workforce does not guarantee an experience of belonging. During an interview session, participant 12 said, \"if they feel like they belong, going to work could always be something people look forward to.\" Participant 1 thought diversity is essential, and everyone should feel welcome because people want to belong; working alongside people who share the same goals is more fulfilling. The difference between this case study and Lambert et al. (2013) study is that their study used a longitudinal methodology using a cross-sectional one where the researchers did not interfere with the participants but only conducted several observations of the same subject over a period. The difference with this study is that it is a flexible case study using interviews and surveys to interact with the participants and collect data based on their experiences. Whether a longitudinal or flexible case study is employed, a sense of belonging is described by this theme, a feeling of being welcome. Research shows that employees are more fulfilled to work alongside people who share the same goals and feel part of something. Everyone wants to be liked and accepted at work, where they spend most of their time away from their families. Participants in this study thought employees have a sense of belonging when their voices are heard. Theme: Ethnocentrism and Diversity Management      Ethnocentrism promoted solidarity within ‘ingroups’ and antagonism toward ‘outgroups. In a sociological and cultural sense, ethnocentrism was a universal tendency of human intergroup relations. The term passed from social science theory into common English usage during the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 155 twentieth century, according to Oldenburg et al. (2015). In current usage, it means the belief that one’s culture is superior to others by using a frame of reference derived from one’s own culture to judge the attributes of another culture, often in disparaging terms. People manifest ethnocentrism when seeing other people, not from their culture or ethnicity, but it can lead to stereotyping and misunderstanding, according to participants 11 and 9. However, participant 12 thought that what matters is workers doing their job as required and did not think globalization influences ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism is evaluating and judging other cultures from one’s own customs and values. According to Dutton et al. (2016), there are two kinds of ethnocentrism: positive and negative. Positive ethnocentrism demonstrates an individual's self-esteem. See the table below, showing responses from survey participants about ethnocentrism and its positive consequences. Table 27. Ethnocentrism has positive consequences in the workplace. Ethnocentrism has positive consequences in the workplace.  Frequency Percent Valid Percent Cumulative Percent Valid Agree 5 33.3 33.3 33.3 Disagree 7 46.7 46.7 80.0 Strongly Agree 3 20.0 20.0 100.0 Total 15 100.0 100.0        Arli et al. (2021) study identified ethnocentrism as both mediator and moderator of the effects of extrinsic ethical decision-making and identified self-righteousness as a mediator of the interaction effects of ethnocentrism. Negative ethnocentrism involves, for example, in the US, expecting someone to speak English or judging others' cultural or ethnic outfits. Arli et al. used a cross-sectional describing a population or groups of individuals at a single moment. This methodology is usually used in healthcare without manipulating variables or interfering with the STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 156 environment. In contrast, this case study used interviews and surveys as the primary data collection methods. There could be literature discussing the management of a diverse workforce using quantitative methods. Still, most used quantitative data analysis and statistics to report findings, and none investigated the strategic leadership of diversity management. Ethnocentrism and nationalism in the workplace, according to studies from many scholars, are linked to globalization and the increase in immigration. That is something expected since, with globalization, people all over the globe are connected because of advances in communication technologies. Africa is not exempted from the impacts of ethnocentrism, a continent where the great powers engage in bitter economic and political competition. Theme: Executive roles in managing diversity.      This theme looked at the roles the highest executive play in managing diversity. Mor Barak et al. (2021) found that CEO's leadership moderates diversity implementation and promotes workplace inclusion. Executive roles and their practices influence inclusion - climate perception and climate strength. Inclusion provides opportunities for members of a diverse workforce to establish ties with one another and to integrate ideas across boundaries in joint problem-solving (Nishii, 2013). According to participants 1 and 3, executive leaders set company culture and what is acceptable; they set the vision and guidelines for the company to foster its success and make things run well, including those that belong to minority groups. Participant 12 said diversity is critical, and CEOs should also find it essential. Participant 4, during an interview, thought that \"their role is to explain where they stand and treat everyone equally; hire from diverse groups of people and equally treat all people without singling anyone or any group out; hiring and promoting employees are some of these roles.\" Gerdeman (2018) argued that the traditional way regulation looks at diversity at firms must be from an HR perspective to hire and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 157 promote minorities to ensure an equal-opportunity workplace. Getting there will take a mindset shift, and for policymakers, the message is clear, according to Layne (2021). GuidoTabellini, a professor of economics at Bocconi University, said: \" If you require or expect an equal contribution from your citizens, all citizens must be treated equally; it reveals the costs for society as a whole if you don’t.” Layne (2021, p.1). This theme’s findings align with the literature, indicating those at the helm of private and public institutions are responsible for what is happening throughout their organization. In the United States, after the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer, some political commentators and officials continue to debate not only the implications of institutional racism but its very existence. This study shows how racial injustice goes far behind its source, with significant consequences; this research was conducted in West Africa, and its findings show how the decision-makers impact the participants. Theme: Inclusion in the workplace      Companies around the globe are paying more attention to inclusion in the workplace. Still, according to Romansky et al. (2021), organizations' most prominent challenge is measuring inclusion to ensure they are doing what is expected. That task is challenging and remains a complex metric to track, Romansky et al. According to Gartner's research, HR leaders identify DEI efforts as a top priority, and the Gartner analysis reveals an 800% increase in job postings for dedicated diversity recruiters. One must also consider the challenge of a non-inclusive workplace a leader faces (Jugdev, 2022). In a manuscript by Cooper et al. (2020), inequities, inequalities, and discrimination are significant issues preventing institutions from fostering diversity and inclusion. These persistent outcomes include the prevalence of implicit bias, homogeneity, hegemonic and toxic patriarchy, and colorblind racism. Color blindness prevents white people, and not so white, from holding onto how race matters in society and the workplace STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 158 (Roberts et al., 2019). According to the participants from Africa, a diverse workforce must be composed of different races, ethnicities, and backgrounds, as shown in the two tables below. Table 28. A diverse workforce should be composed of members from different races. A diverse workforce should be composed of members from different races.

It helps employees get closer, communicate, and feel welcomed because everyone wants to belong (participants 1 and 11). For participant 13, diversity and inclusion should be integral to strategic planning and infused in policy and practices: surveys or other ways to let everyone have a say. According to participants 2 and 3, the more inclusive a leader is, the more diverse the workplace will become; Inclusive leadership will make team members feel that their opinions are essential no matter where they come from and where their status stands in the company. This theme shows that inclusion in the workplace creates an atmosphere of respect where good communication STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 159 occurs between leaders and their employees. Leaders must act pretty, manage all work seriously as a team, and recognize each employee's contribution to organizational performance. Organizational leadership must be optimistic about inclusion by preaching and practicing it. The themes described in the above manuscript align with what inclusion in the workplace should be. Theme: Globalization and the Management of Diversity      Successful management of a diverse workforce is among the most critical global challenges faced by organizational leaders, executives, human resource managers, and management consultants (Mor Barak et al., 2021). Homogeneity is becoming heterogeneity in the workplace, and there is no path backward, posit Mor Barak and colleagues. The challenges these managers face in a diverse workforce are their inability to fully comprehend the phenomenon and dissociate themselves from prejudicial attitudes to unleash the potential of a multicultural workforce. This phenomenon of managing a diverse workforce experienced by the participants in this study is demonstrated by their answers to the interviews and surveys conducted in a West African organization. Participants 1 and 11 appreciated the benefits of globalization because they think it allows a diverse workforce to be more global-minded and not strangled by ethnocentrism. They also believed it expands diversity and its benefits regarding new technology acquisition. Globalization has some positives and negatives, according to participant 3; however, it also makes a complex situation with diversity more challenging and may seem threatening to some intragroup conflict, said Participant 4.      Moreover, globalization has a positive side because it can change the mentality of individuals by learning new technologies from the West, seen from an African point of view, asserted participant 5. Participant 7 thought globalization might deprive locals of getting the jobs they need because of those so-called immigrants from other countries. He further indicated that he has STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 160 problems working with strangers and never got along with them because of the bad experience. That experience has cultivated the trouble he has hiring strangers. The analysis of this theme shows that the participants' perspectives from the study and insights from the literature align well with the difficulties associated with globalization and managing diversity. People movements around the globe and competition in the workplace based on the presence of foreign workers with a new set of skills and cultural backgrounds make diversity management exceptionally challenging. As Mor Barak et al. (2021) said, there is no easy way out of this situation. The West and Africa understand diversity differently because, in Africa, diversity characteristics are based on religion, linguistics, ethnicity, and other belief systems, Appiah et al. (2018). Theme: Cultural Competency and the Management of Diversity      According to Jugdev (2022), cultural intelligence can develop organizational leadership. Cultural intelligence can enhance leaders’ ability to apply adaptive skills, such as knowledge acquisition, cultural competence, and a sustainable vision. With fast-changing demands, preparing leaders with the right skillsets can help them succeed, posits Jugdev. According to findings from participants in this study from Africa, cultural competency is necessary for managing a diverse workforce. Participants interviewed in this study have different viewpoints about cultural competency compared to findings in the literature about the same theme. As explained earlier, cultural competency excludes race from the equation in Africa but focuses on ethnicity, linguistics, and some beliefs. However, Participant 1 thought that cultural competency is necessary for leaders because diversity brings to the workspace several cultural beliefs. But knowing a little about their employees' culture is suitable for leading a diverse workforce, according to participant 15. Understanding others' cultures can help leaders in managing and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 161 learn about them. Experiencing different ethnic groups will able leaders to deal with employees properly, posits participant 4.      However, not everyone agrees with linking cultural competency with effectively managing a diverse workforce. According to (Nwonka & Malik, 2018), there are cultural discourses and practices in which conclusions are drawn to suggest that inclusion strategies and policies are beset with irresolvable tension arising from the attempt to amalgamate neoliberal economic policies with cultural approaches. Moreover, Newsinger (2012, p. 142) found that labor cultural policy could not make a case for diversity that was not based on economic criteria, as opposed to a moral argument. The findings from the African participants and the findings in the literature from the Western countries align with some concepts brought by the participants. Still, both sides have differences in how cultural competency is viewed. Theme: CEO's Cultural Beliefs and Moral Values      (Ng & Sears, 2020) conducted a test in which CEO beliefs about predicting the implementation of organizational diversity through CEO engagement in pro-diversity behavior and higher CEO commitment as perceived by their HR managers provide a crucial contribution to diversity management that demonstrates that a CEO's word and actions matter for setting the stage for diversity initiatives. Their study also found that \"higher moral values were associated with increased pro-diversity behaviors when CEOs have fewer positive beliefs about diversity\" (Ng & Sears, 2020, p. 10). Based on participants' viewpoints, this current study found that the leader's moral values and ethics are critical in managing diversity or any other group (participant 15). participant 8 thought that the leader's moral values and ethics must be referenced as an example of a model that can aid the leader in understanding diversity.  STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 162      Participant 9 believed that leaders respecting their employee's religious beliefs, moral values, and ethics could benefit them in their leadership roles. However, according to (Kirton & Greene, 2019), diversity shifted from the moral of combating discrimination and disadvantage experienced by minority groups to a notion of workforce diversity encompassing individual differences and diversity policies for achieving organizational goals. In the same vein, Kirton and Greene argued that inclusion could overcome some of the criticisms of diversity in the workforce by centering it on exploiting differences and disregarding the moral case for equality. Hence, most practitioners reframe their services as delivering on the economic side. The empirical evidence from participants in this study demonstrates that in the context of this study, these employees did not think that moral leadership values are or can be centered on the business goals rather than the moral case. Hence, there is a bit of misalignment with the findings from the study. According to the participants in the study, leaders’ ethics matter. See the survey result below. Table 30. Leaders' ethics have an impact on diversity management. Leaders' ethics have an impact on diversity management.

Diversity based on race negatively affects certain marginalized groups. When the #MeToo movement sparked up, and it was found out that the founder of #MeToo is a Black woman, it was discovered that a lot of struggles that a black STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 163 woman goes through are not the same as those a Black man may go through, and with police brutality, one starts to realize that inequality is real and played out in life, according to Leath et al. (2022). Andrew, born in Kenya, said his family instilled in him the idea that light skin was superior to darker skin shades (Phoenix & Craddock, 2022). He could remember his grandmother making references to lighter people being more beautiful. According to Andrew, his family reproduced a colorist skin-shade hierarchy with implications for how family members perceived their skin shades. Kenya’s colonial history has its footprint here. European colonialism led to the privileging of whiteness and light skin, Phoenix and Craddock. Using qualitative research, these two mentioned cases from Leath et al. (2022) and (Phoenix & Craddock, 2022) demonstrate diversity's consequences in society and the workplace. The discourse regarding the positive side of diversity is pervasive in the literature.       Participants 9 and 10 in the study thought diversity in skill sets is more important than diversity based on race or skin color. It exerts ethnocentrism the opposite and can be catastrophic. A woman, participant 4, said during the interview that she had many frustrations working because white people did not care about black people. “Promoting diversity” frequently singles out one group over another and can lead to workforce tension and frustration, said participant 9 during the interview. (Khan & Kalra, 2022) conducted studies and found that the composition of a workforce forms the face of the company and impacts consumers’ moral perceptions because of their attitudes and behavior toward the firm. A diverse workforce embodies greater moral traits and is less likely to engage in immoral behaviors. Because of their broader perspectives, diverse teams are more engaged and have outstanding perspective-taking capabilities. This theme of the Consequences of Diversity in the Workplace aligns with the findings from the participants in this study conducted in West Africa. All the investigations STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 164 concerning this theme describing the consequences of management of diversity in the workplace used quantitative research to examine diversity based on race, gender, and nationality, except for this current study and the studies from Khan and Kalra that used qualitative research methods. Survey responses from the participants show that some employees may experience difficulties with a diverse workforce. Table 31.

Studies found that diverse organizations are equipped to connect to a broader consumer base, improve decision-making, problem-solving, and flexibility, and have an opportunity to create more innovative solutions (Burrell, 2016). Brown et al. (2022), in their study of attrition of workers with marginalized identities on artificial intelligence (AI), found the weakening is linked to a cultural climate and strategies depriving these teams of more inclusion and representative of the diverse communities affected by technologies because of a lack of equity and access to algorithms. They also found psychological bases for innovation brought by these teams and their \"perspectives that may disrupt the comfort and assumption of STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 165 the White heterodoxy that ignores the complexity of cultural differences\" Brown et al. (2022, pp 1-9). Participants 1, 11, 13, and 15 agreed that different perspectives from a diverse workforce with many backgrounds, viewpoints, and knowledge would examine problems with different foci and ideas concerning the pros and cons of solutions that could stimulate innovation. A survey included in this study shows that diversity motivates employees. See the table below. Table 32. Promoting diversity motivates team members. Promoting diversity motivates team members.

When employees appreciate the fruit of their hard labor as a dedicated, diverse workforce working in harmony, they will also see improved well-being. The themes in this study focus on inclusive and ethical leadership behavior, ethics, and moral values, leaders' cultural competency, consequences of globalization, ethnocentrism, creativity, and innovation in the workplace. The studies conducted by these researchers used qualitative research analysis, and their findings align with this current study's findings from participants from West Africa. The findings of this qualitative study using NVivo to explore strategic leadership for managing diversity with participants' narrations from West Africa are consistent with prior research (Leath et al., 2022; Gerdeman, 2019; Cooper et al., 2020; Ly (2020; Hassan, 2019; Ware et al., 2020; Olson, 2017). The only gap observed when conducting this research is a lack of specific STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 166 literature exploring 'strategic leadership for managing diversity,' the purpose of this study. The other difference I found between this current study and most studies from the literature is that most used quantitative research analysis to report their findings.       Leath et al. (2022) found in their study that women need collective organizing and leadership in addition to educating others by forming organizations, serving in leadership roles, and getting involved in institutional efforts for change. This idea of serving in leadership roles aligns with what one participant in West Africa mentioned when she said that women bring more innovation than men in organizations because they are more tuned in how things are done and create an environment with an ambiance of a family than men. Felisha Leggette-Jack, Head Coach of the University of the Buffalo Bulls basketball team, answered a question about diversity in the United States college leadership (Cooper et al., 2020). In response to the question, she said she is saddened because most women basketball players look like her and need role models like them. Many racial minorities and women in these positions have a desire and ideas to improve diversity and inclusion. Still, they are not allowed to lead or initiate the efforts needed to implement the necessary changes in sports, Cooper et al. (2020). Olanike (2022), in a TED Talk, asserts: Biases in your systems and processes mean people from particular demographic groups succeed at different rates than the dominant groups, with some not set up to succeed at all. This process leaves you with a disproportionate organizational chart, poor work culture, and an undervalued, expensive place to be. What can you do to mitigate bias & advance equity in your workplace? 1) Learn: about bias and how this shows up in your workplace systems, not just in people. 2) Take action: put procedures in place to mitigate biases – consistently across your team STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 167 and equip your people accordingly. 3) Keep going iterate by continually assessing for and addressing bias to keep it in check.      Continuous reports of unethical behavior of officials and public managers call for examining the moral phenomenology intertwined with moral thought and understanding the role of individual experience and contextual circumstances in moral decisions, Hassan (2019). According to research findings, cross-cultural leadership helps leaders understand the cultural contingencies under which they operate and see their role in creating a harmonious and generalized unifying cultural background to allow co-workers to change the organizational structure, Ly (2020). Participant 1 in the study said during an interview, \"as a leader, when you know about your workers' cultural differences and share them, it will guide you in understanding diversity.\" In an effort to improve diversity and confront bias in the workplace, according to Ware et al. (2020), leaders must foster an inclusive and equitable and diverse workplace diversity by identifying and mitigating racism and unconscious bias within organizations with programs and mechanisms free from racial and gender discrimination by recognizing diversity, inclusion, and equity. In an article published in The New York Times, Olson (2017) said that companies have been committed to diversity for many years, but making employees feel valued and included has been complicated. Likewise, a Harvard Business Review article (Sherbin & Rashid, 2017) noted a gap between recognizing the leadership behaviors that unlock the capability of practicing them.      Roberts et al. (2019) argued that when ethnic minorities are appointed to executive roles, they find themselves on a glass cliff in precarious leadership positions such as management of organizations in crisis. Leaders coach their workers, provide regular feedback, and champion STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 168 them, showing them they have their backs and not just throwing them into the pool's deep end and expecting them to survive independently. Instead, they must stick with them to provide the support they need to succeed. The authors conclude that practitioners should focus on managing injustice and whiteness rather than managing diversity. However, both sides claim injustice. Summary of the Findings.       The themes described in this study examine the empirical link between leadership strategy in managing diversity and organizational change with interview and survey data from participants in West Africa who have experienced the effects of diversity in the workplace. The study examines the theoretical connections from the literature and empirical evidence from participants of a diverse workforce. The study revealed the positive and negative consequences of diversity management in organizations diffusing inclusive leadership, moral values, the strategic role of executives, cultural competency, ethnocentrism, globalization, leadership behaviors, and other aspects of strategic leadership for effective management of diversity.      The study findings, based on the theoretical and empirical pieces of evidence, confirm the complex reality and difficulties of managing diversity in the workplace. Race and ethnicity still matter in the workplace and represent barriers for many employees who are frustrated with employers unwilling to address their concerns, which leaves them less engaged, less satisfied with their work, and less loyal to their companies, Roberts et al. (2019). The findings yield themes related to leadership behavior that can lessen or augment the efficacy of leading a diverse workforce. They also describe the comprehensive actions organizations need to empower employees by creating a playing field for opportunities and an inclusive, bias-free work environment. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 169 Application to Professional Practice      This study was conducted for organizational leaders seeking to take diversity management to the next level as a corporate strategy using a data-driven qualitative approach, data analysis, and statistics to detect patterns and select evidence interventions to advance workplace inclusion behaviors, Mattingly et al. (2022). The data gathered in this study were coded and analyzed using NVivo. Diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) can be learned through data gathering used as empirical evidence to show the impact or lack thereof of DEI efforts on people in organizations, posit Mattingly et al. Globalization in the 21st century, according to (Ghemawat & Altman, 2019), has been shaped by a war between economic fundamentals and policy threats predicting a collapse with a wave of economic nationalism. However, the world ended in 2017 more globalized than ever, and there is no turning back. Today the workplace of organizations around the globe is flooded with workers from all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Nations in Africa, where this study took place, are no exception to the rule imposed by globalization. According to (Castañeda & Shemesh, 2020), \"globalization is at the forefront of the contestation of the prospective evolution of culture, whether spoken about as a catalyst for cultural unity or cultural division.\" (p. 15). The following paragraph will describe the recommendations for further study based on the research findings. Improving General Leadership Practice      Diversity management is essential for organizations in today's demographics mixed in workplaces around the globe. This study discussed diversity management through strategic leadership, which provides starting points for leaders to reflect on their strategic management of diversity and plan for organizational structural change. This study provides practitioners with solutions to the realities businesses face today as the workplace is in a metamorphosis state of STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 170 homogeneity to workforce diversity. The findings suggest that managers must know their diverse employees through cultural competence, exhibiting moral values, empowerment, executive leadership involvement, and inclusive leadership to make employees feel they belong and enjoy their work. When participants were surveyed concerning how leadership behaviors enhance the effective management of diversity and how a leader's moral value impact diversity, 80% said leaders need to be open-minded and respectful and treat everyone equally. See the table below. Table 33. How can leaders' behaviors enhance the effective management of diversity? How can leaders' behaviors enhance the effective management of diversity?  Frequency Percent Valid Percent Cumulative Percent Valid  12 80.0 80.0 80.0 no response 1 6.7 6.7 86.7 They need to be more open-minded. Leaders' behavior must be welcoming. 1 6.7 6.7 93.3 What the leader is doing is an example for others too. They must treat everybody with the same amount of respect and be equally valued and accepted. 1 6.7 6.7 100.0 Total 15 100.0 100.0        They also agreed ethical leadership values impact diversity management. Among an organization's social responsibilities is its moral obligation to include the others, such as people from minority groups and people with disability, in the labor market (Holvino & Kamp, 2009). Leaders' moral values are essential when it comes to managing diversity, said participant 15 during an interview. Moral values in leadership provide disciplined behaviors towards others, including elderly workers and the disabled, and allow leaders to weigh their language or STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 171 communicate respectfully to make the encounter peaceful, said participant 9 answering an interview question. Participant 8 in this study conducted in West Africa underlined \"that a leader's moral values and ethics are references and examples of a model that can aid leaders in understanding diversity; without both, you cannot be a good leader.\"       Good moral practices help to avoid focusing only on the business-driven rationale and paying attention to moral arguments like social justice by leveraging human differences toward organizational effectiveness by including others and their unique perspectives (Davidson, 1999; Plummer, 2003, p. 13). According to the psychology of morality, morality is rooted in the social condition and the human psyche because people live in groups, and their behaviors affect one another, Rest (1986). Morality province is to provide guidelines for knowing how the benefits and burdens of cooperative living are to be distributed, Rawls (1971). That is one reason participant 15 in the study said that \"a leader's moral values and ethics are critical in managing diversity or any other group.\" Morality is also rooted in the requirements of cooperative social organization; people feel dire witnessing distress in others, and a supportive relationship with one another is one of the primary goods humans values, posit Rest. (Jennings & Stahl-wert, 2016) said: Human being value cannot be explained only by the work they do, the things they make, or the services they offer; they are not valuable because of their doings but because they are. This is why they are called human beings, not human doings (p. 139).      Increasing diversity and inclusion in organizations, including educational institutions, is a strategic endeavor, and an objective, according to (Antonio et al., 2004; Gurin et al., 2002). According to Mattingly et al. (2022), when organizations foster inclusive behavior, they make STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 172 their policies more inclusive and more equitable; inclusive behaviors make others valued, respected, seen, and heard. However, Espinosa et al. (2019) study found that the presence of minorities as full-time faculty is minimal, showing that 75% of full-time faculty were White. And in public institutions, only 5.1% out of 345000 full-time were Black (U.S. Department of Education, 2016). In academia, a focus on individual differences, intergroup relations, and inequities in the workplace leads to research topics such as prejudice reduction, cross-cultural competencies, and access to information (Holvino & Kamp, 2009). These differences contemplated as the core of diversity management arguments may be related to undesirable moral values from decision-makers, a lack of cultural competencies, a lack of inclusiveness, or discrimination in the workplace. Thus, to implement successful strategies for managing diversity, undesirable moral values, a lack of inclusive behaviors, and discrimination must be condemned. Potential Implementation Strategies      Successfully implementing strategies for managing diversity requires leaders' continuous engagement and commitment to promoting diversity in the workplace. The constant attention of leaders at many levels of organizations is necessary for transforming the culture and infusing workforce diversity into the organization's core values, Lim (2023). The apparent leaders, including chairs, executives, and managers, must be informed and educated on the relevance and importance of diversity management strategies because they must understand it well. Education, awareness, and engagement of the next generation of managers are also necessary for continuing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Organizations must be committed to diversity and show what they have done to be executed because if the people one looks up to do not treat them with respect, that can have an impression on them, Siderio (2022). Participant 12 echoed that leaders must treat all employees equally and not differentiate them based on job roles. Participant STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 173 15 said, \"We all deserve respect and good communication between our leaders and us. They must have confidence and respect toward us, be veridic, and communicate sincerely.\" Participants 5 and 6 expressed the same sentiment: \"Leaders should respect workers for who they are. as long as they do the job right and get it done, and it shouldn't matter how diverse the workforce is. They need to be on the same level as their employees, humble, and respectful. According to Lim (2023), there is still a wide gap between the representation of women in senior leadership positions and men. To correct this unfair practice, leaders at the helm can cultivate allies and allyship, individuals who understand and act on the need for equal and fair treatment of people not like them. It has been discovered that workshops can promote allyship, an essential part of any successful DEI initiatives, posits Lim.      Implementing diversity management in organizations involves examining policies for promoting equity, diversity, and inclusiveness in the workplace; these practices are site dependent and most effective when supported by senior executives (shahi et al., 2019). According to Mattingly et al. (2022), using the organization's data \"data, as you'll come to find, is the operative word.\" (p. 8). The organizational data determine the requirements for implementing diversity management in organizations. Thus, the practices are site dependent and call for consideration because every organization uses data differently to analyze workforce diversity, as illustrated by this study conducted in West Africa. Diversity management is a values-based field that uses applied behavioral science methods, research, and theory to manage the organizational change that supports diversity and eliminates oppression based on human differences to improve organizational effectiveness, Brazzel (2003). Applied behavioral science includes disciplines such as human resource management, organizational behavior, and organizational development that directly relate to diversity management and other subjects. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 174      Therefore, to implement diversity management practices, one needs to look at several organizing principles, including leadership behaviors, beliefs, and values, and integrate diversity into all behavioral functions in the workplace, Plummer (2003). The participants in this study stressed the importance of leadership moral values and beliefs that must align with company values and that the leaders' moral values and ethics are essential in managing diversity or any other groups. Participant 8 in the study thought leaders who lack good moral values and ethics would fail because their employees will not listen to them. A leader of a diverse workforce must be attended to and be a good listener simultaneously. Participant 9 said, \"when leaders respect their employee's religious beliefs, moral values, and ethics, that can help them in their leadership roles.\" CEOs advocating higher moral values will display remarkable pro-diversity behavior, according to (Ng & Sears, 2020). According to Harvard University (2018), pursuing excellence requires self-respect and respect from others by engaging with colleagues through respectful dialogue, being present, and listening first to understand rather than to judge. Leadership must pay attention to diversity processes and the knowledge and skills from training in directing the racially and ethnically diverse workforce, as Vlas et al. (2022) suggested. The organizational processes include resource-management routines, internal processes that facilitate development by expanding access to resources critical for inclusion, and decision-making processes that empower the underprivileged, argued Vlas and colleagues.      One study by Bax (2023) questioned the benefits of implementing diversity and inclusiveness in workplaces for investors. Bax said to find evidence that investors might suffer returns and pay for investing in responsible employers in the U.S. and E.U. markets. When diversity implementation is linked to only economic revenues, it is similar to saying that organizational social responsibility may not benefit investors. However, today investors are people with concern STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 175 for the environment and the population they serve as a whole compared to decades ago. Today investors take organizational moral values seriously as part of doing business, not just for the monetary benefits they gain from investing. Research findings show investors are more concerned about corporate social responsibility when spending their hard-earned money than profits alone. The concept of understanding and bridging differences requires one to be aware of how culture and experiences shape people's perspectives and how others' backgrounds inform their views, Harvard University (2018). As illustrated by participant 7, who said: \"Everyone has their values and differences, but if everyone respects one another, we can contribute to one another culture without alienation. If everyone accepts and respects everyone's culture and differences, there will not be a problem in the workplace concerning diversity.\" The expected result would be functional diversity concerned with the differences in knowledge and perspectives held by team members, as Dayan et al. (2017) described.      Moreover, Vlas et al. (2022) found that integrating, building, and reconfiguring racially diverse workforces through diversity-specific management routines, such as mentoring, recruiting practices, and succession planning for the underrepresented, will enhance the ability to compete, which increases organizational performance. But Vlas and colleagues recognized that company performance is conditional on the presence of diversity cognition practice, and failing to incorporate such practice will not benefits organizations financially. Participant 11 said, \"A diverse workforce brings people from all backgrounds, viewpoints, and knowledge that can promote innovation.\" That alone can lead to organizational performance. Bax (2022) should have included this point in the findings of diverse and inclusive workplaces' benefit to investors. Cognition is a mental process of gaining knowledge and understanding through thought and experiences. The process will benefit employers, employees, and society when diversity is STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 176 implemented based on moral values and beliefs to do good. There are impediments, such as limited access to information, and resources essential for more vital roles in decision-making processes at the hierarchical levels, constraining organizational potential to benefit from their minority talents, Vlas et al. (2022). To implement diversity successfully, leaders must be coached to accept feedback. According to Goldsmith et al. (2000), feedback connects what a leader thinks and does between the leader's intention and how others perceive those actions. Without feedback, one can never be sure how their behavior affects others. Seeking feedback and evaluation are the way one can learn about their strengths and weaknesses (Jennings & Stahl-Wert, 2016, p. 151). Participant 9 in this study, during an interview, said, \"promoting diversity by singling out one group over another can lead to workforce tension and frustration.\" The participant continued to say: When you employ someone, you need to put that individual in good working conditions so they can see themselves in their work; people worldwide have different strengths a company could use through the respect and leadership skills they portray by standing up for what's right.      Implementing diversity in the workplace is more about awareness-building initiatives. It is a process of disciplinary actions within the foundation of applied behavioral science theory and methodology, according to Plummer (2003). During the interviewing sessions, participants 9, 12, and 15 raised concerns about how leaders' moral values impact a diverse workforce. They said, \" The leader's moral values and ethics are critical in managing diversity or any other group.” Moral values help leaders understand their team; for example, discipline and behaviors towards others, especially the elderly worker, are essential; they allow you to weigh your language or communication to make the encounter peaceful. Also, when leaders respect their employee's STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 177 religious beliefs, moral values, and ethics can aid them in their leadership roles. Participant 12 in this study said: If you do not respect your job, the leadership's moral values can affect you negatively; moreover, CEO's moral values need to align with the company's values. One should model the behavioral values appropriate for the communities in which one works (Harvard University, 2018).      In implementing effective diversity management in organizations, executive leaders need to expand access to social networks, preferential information, and resources critical for greater inclusion, and minorities gain more vital roles in decision-making processes, posit Vlas et al. (2022). According to (Allen et al., 2004; McDonald & Westphal, 2013), by increasing minority participation in decision-making processes through mentoring programs and formal network groups, businesses acquire and retain diverse management groups for involvement in decision-making processes at all hierarchical levels. When members feel that they are included and their perspectives and knowledge are leveraged in decision-making processes, organizations can realize the potential benefits of diversity, according to Brown et al. (2020).      Visibli, a Professional Training and Coaching organization in Atlanta, GA, 2022, posted on LinkedIn that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion are three different jobs. Sure, they're all related, but they're not the same. Diversity - focuses on hiring diverse talent requires gaining buy-in from hiring managers and leadership, building various pipelines, creating a positive employer brand, and de-biasing hiring processes. Equity - focuses on providing individual employees (and candidates) with the power, agency, and resources they need to have equal access to successful outcomes (promotions, work satisfaction, networking, learning and development, and opportunities). Inclusion - focuses on creating an internal environment that recognizes differences and allows them to be meaningfully involved in decision-making processes. It STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 178 consists in assessing current systems, benefits, structures, and practices. It requires training and development as well as iteration as new team members join the team. Summary of Application to Professional Practice      This study helps improve leadership management of diversity by using strategies based on data-driven qualitative data analysis and statistics to select evidence interventions to advance workplace inclusion behaviors. Today organizations are flooded with workers from all races, ethnicities, and backgrounds, requiring leaders to rethink their strategies for managing such a diverse workforce with organizational structural change. Managers must develop cultural competency, exhibit moral values, empowerment, and executive leadership involvement in making employees feel they belong and enjoy their work. As mentioned early in the introduction, successfully implementing strategies for managing diversity requires leaders' continuous engagement and commitment to promoting diversity in the workplace. Leaders' role in implementing diversity is essential, and it starts with treating all employees with respect and sincere communication. Leaders need to be humble and respectful, said one of the participants, and that is paramount. To infuse diversity awareness in the workplace, leaders can promote allyship, an important initiative for successful DEI implementation. This initiative also involves examining policies that promote equity, diversity, and inclusiveness based on what the data reveal about their demographic characteristics. The data represent the operative word determining the requirement for implementing diversity management in organizations, which is site dependent. Diversity management is a values-based field that uses applied behavioral science methods, including human resources management, organizational behavior, and organizational development. Thus the process for implementing diversity is site dependent and STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 179 requires several organizing principles, including leadership behaviors, beliefs, and values, to integrate diversity into all behavioral functions in the workplace. Recommendations for Further Study       Based on the findings from this study, most participants stressed the need for leadership with good moral values. Even though this research was conducted in West Africa, it seems that the leaders' moral values matter in the universal space when managing diversity in the workplace. Participant 15, during an interview, said, \"leader's moral values and ethics are critical in managing diversity or any other group. Moral values have a long history in social services and are now being sought in managing a diverse workforce. These moral values are a critical area of research and practice that requires further studies to discover how organizations can develop them in their leadership teams to enable them to lead with serenity and treat all employees fairly regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, and cultural background.  At the World Economic Forum, Seidman (2021) said ethical leadership matters now more than ever. One anticipated theme in the study was awakened leadership, which concerns moral leadership. Marques (2018) argued that awakened leadership is acquired through wakefulness, which is a skill one develops by \"thinking, feeling, observing, experiencing, learning, and unlearning, in other words, by living.\" (p. 11). As part of their ability to continuously reflect, adapt, and respect, awakened leaders understand the value of listening to and considering ideas from as wide a range of stakeholders as possible. They are aware that this expands the range of options and enhances motivation (p. 12). Similar ideas are brought to light by most of the participants in this study. During their interviews, participants 8, 9, and 11 said: The leader's moral value and ethics is a reference first, an example of a model that can aid the leader in understanding diversity. If a leader does not have good moral STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 180 values and ethics, they cannot be a good leader. Moreover, lousy leadership's moral values can affect you negatively. Also, when leaders respect their employee's religious beliefs, moral values, and ethics can aid them in their leadership roles.      Moral leadership is a subject that requires further studies to find out how organizations can develop ethical leadership in their management teams. According to Seidman (2021), managers with high levels of moral leadership also have stronger connections with co-workers and tend to show ethical behaviors during crises. The same principle applies to prosocial leadership because businesses today need such leaders more than ever. The 21st century has brought several organizational development and improvement changes because of advanced technologies, new insights, and revelations to enhance corporate diversity management. Amongst these revelations are the concept of awakened leadership in the social age, prosocial leadership, and self-leadership, to name a few. These leadership styles can help organizations face the challenges derived from globalization, wherein the workforce has become a melting pot where people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and cultural differences meet and work together.       The findings from this current study demonstrate the necessity of the leadership mentioned above styles. According to Marques (2018, p. 11), people are exposed to ways of acting, thinking, and building relationships that describe the undeniable interdependency between individuals. Technology, such as design thinking, is the driver that requires an open mind which leads to wakefulness, such as alertness to think further and more profoundly than what is considered the typical way, posits Marques. Organizations need awakened leaders with ethical and moral values. Most of the participants in this study emphasized the need for leaders of moral values that align with their company's values. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 181      Leaders with strong moral values are needed for organizations to transform themselves and the people they manage (Russell & Lipsky, 2008). Religious beliefs are essential for shaping identity and providing ongoing social cues that form a basis for prosocial behaviors (Ewest & Weeks, 2018; Weick, 1995). Those with few religious convictions appear to follow a pattern that makes understanding their behavior difficult; however, leaders with altruism driven by spiritual values or other ethical frameworks are essential to ensure successful outcomes for society (Ewest 2017). Based on the findings from this study, several examples from the participants provided information suggesting that with a growing interdependency, leaders in organizations need to show mutual respect driven by the knowledge of life as a system of progress where people interact holistically for the betterness of humanity.      Most of the participants in the study stressed the importance of leaders' moral values as a foundation for moving forward with more universal connections. Participant 7, during an interview, said: \"Workers in a team need to have the same vision and tell the truth to one another. If people from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities work together, it is not accidental; it is something God has planned.\" Participant 15 said the leader's ethical behaviors are critical in managing diversity, and these leaders must have confidence and respect toward their employees, plus veridic, sincere communication with them. The scholar's research on leadership is vast and growing, and several approaches have been defined, including self-leadership, Dhiman (2018). This leadership, according to Dhiman, is a self-discovery that begins with self-knowledge that concerns leading from within, knowing oneself, and living one's deepest values at all levels, including personal and organizational. This emerging leadership style is vital for developing exemplary leaders, Manz (2015). A self-leadership is comparable to an inclusive leadership style; they both care about others. One cannot lead others unless one can lead their self-first. The STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 182 findings from the participants in the study talked about the impact inclusive leaders have on a team. They include and accept everyone as a member and often inspire inclusivity in their practices and ethical behaviors. Reflections      Conducting this research has helped the researcher critically analyze the causes of a lack of a strategy for managing diversity in the workplace. Using data gathered from participants' interviews and surveys, the researcher analyzed the data for a better understanding of the phenomenon and how writing about it can give practitioners and decision-makers the knowledge they need to understand better managing a diverse workforce, and the practices they could deploy to correct the lack of leadership strategy for managing diversity in organizations around the globe. Listening to the participants narrate their life experiences dealing with their managers as members of a diverse workforce taught the researcher that this phenomenon is universal and not unique to the western countries where the researcher has experienced the same feeling these employees are going through in their work life. Personal & Professional Growth      Conducting this research has allowed the researcher to explore why diversity management fails or succeeds in organizations. Researching why there is a lack of strategic leadership in managing diversity in the workplace gave the researcher access to information concerning this sensitive topic of study. The subject is sensitive to the point where most organizations do not want to participate in such research. The time this research was launched coincided with the pandemic and around the mid-term election in the U.S. It took the researcher several attempts to find an organization in the USA in vain. Finally, the researcher has to rely on connections from an organization in West Africa to conduct the study. Most U.S. organizations did not want to get STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 183 involved for several reasons, according to feedback received when requests were sent to ask for gatekeeper access authorization. Some gatekeepers or H.R. managers emphasize the size of their organization, being a startup, the COVID-19 pandemic, or flat-out denial of access.      The atmosphere was hot and complex for many organizations to engage in such a research topic. The interviews and surveys were conducted in French and transcribed in English, which took extra time to complete. Nevertheless, it was a good learning experience for both the researcher and the participants in the study. The learning experiences include meeting and interviewing new people. It was discovered during the research that what employees care about the most are the moral values and behaviors displayed by those who manage them. Several participants expressed their need to work in organizations where the leadership practice is fair to all, and everyone is included in the decision-making process and respected. These participants thought that a leader is someone everyone looks up to and must comport themself ethically, without any discrimination or prejudice toward others because of demographic differences. Conducting this research has provided a sense of what good leaders are and how they treat their employees. Understanding this research's impact helps the researcher gain new perspectives about diversity in the workplace and how managers' behavior is a moderator of it. The insights gained from this study have prepared the researcher to start writing journal articles and books on this subject. Even though the research was conducted in Africa, the researcher understands that effectively managing diversity is not specific to one country as it is to an organization. The management of diversity has become a corporate strategy in this data-driven age. Biblical Perspective      Based on the findings of this present study, leaders' moral values are necessary for managing a diverse workforce or any other group. The values of integrity, respect for others, self-respect, STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 184 compassion, and altruism are essential for the quality of life in the organizations these leaders run (Jennings & Stahl-wert, 2016). Participant 12 in this research, during the interviewing, said that the CEO's moral values need to align with the company's values, suggesting companies do business to serve the community, including their employees, in a manner that values their efforts and contribution to the organization. Values are defined as beliefs that have worth and importance or are valuable. Moral describes what societies consider suitable and acceptable. Moral values then translate to guidelines for deciding between right and wrong. (English Standard Version Bible, 2001, 2 Timothy 2:15) said: \"Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.\" According to Nullens (2019), faith and work call for assumed responsibility for the common good. (English Standard Version Bible, 2001, Galatians 5:22 - 6:7) reminds people that the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, and faithfulness and that God is not mocked, for whatever one sow, that will he also reap. Therefore, leading others in the workplace calls for someone who has faith, loves, and respects others. Participant 12 in this current study stressed the need for a good leader who gives everyone respect, differentiates employees based on ethnicity, and treats all employees fairly.      However, because of the power associated with leadership, leaders must be committed to goals and ideals that transcend the self, such as compassion and altruism, because their absence leads to the arena where toxic leaders operate, Lipman-Blumen (2005). Toxic leaders dwindle into mediocrity, and Lord Action's famous dictum applies here. \"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" (p. 213-214). According to Jennings and Stahl-wert (2016), the responsibility of any leader is to teach others what they need to succeed and remove barriers by giving away their values. \"What separates Serving Leaders from ordinary leaders is that STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 185 they're on the trail of such a purpose. Serving Leaders articulate a purpose so compelling that people are willing to run toward it.\" (p. 108). (English Standard Version Bible, 2001, Colossians 3:22-24) said: Bondservants, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord. Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that you will receive the inheritance as your reward from the Lord (p. 5100).      It is believed that is how people have been designed to function best, posit Jennings and Stahl-wert (2016). Participant 7, during an interview, said: \"If people from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities get together and work as a team, it is not by accident; it is something God has planned.\" (English Standard Version Bible, 2001, Romans 12:4-8) reminds the people, \"In one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function. Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.\"      In many instances during this research study, using interviews and surveys, participants had the common sense that to manage a diverse workforce, leaders need to exercise sound moral values. Some researchers equate good moral values to the distribution of economic importance and ignore the moral value that signifies honesty;  those values and norms that describe specific manners, such as the norm \"Thou shalt not lie,\" based on the value of honesty. According to Jennings and Stahl-Wert (2016, p. 141), great leaders take a genuine interest in their people because it is necessary for leaders to get honest about their care for others; authenticity is hard to STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 186 fake. According to Koerner (2014), morally worthy goals include upholding principles such as honesty, altruism, and preventing harm to others. Only those leaders who show courage will demonstrate honesty and fairness in leading others; it is a universal principle of moral value despite organizational location in the globe and their management style. Great leaders take steps to learn who their workers are and ask about their lives, aspirations, struggles, and needs. Great leaders are also sure they listen, make room for authentic human connection, and build on it over time. Great leaders give their people increasing responsibility and authority, empowerment, and challenge them to succeed, argued Jennings and Stahl-Wert. Summary of Reflections      The researcher used a semi-structured interview and a survey to collect data from the fifteen employees who participated in the research. The specific and general problem to be addressed is the lack of possible failure of a leadership strategy for managing diversity resulting in decreased workers' job satisfaction, well-being, organizational success, and representation of women and ethnic minorities in senior leadership positions. This research took place within a West African organization operating in the security industry technology. The participants who participated in the study included the H.R. director, several supervisors and their subordinates, middle managers, and executives at upper-level organizations. This research used a case study with a flexible design allowing the research to use semi-structured interviews, surveys, and other methods to collect data. The collected data's themes include leadership behaviors necessary for managing diversity; leadership style the participants believe can empower a diverse workforce; inclusiveness that provides employees with a sense of belonging; and globalization and ethnocentrism's impact in today's diverse workforce. After a thorough thematic analysis of the data collected from the participants, themes emerged related to the research questions and survey STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 187 questionnaires. These themes align with the conceptual research framework. The data analysis also yields patterns that prove that diversity management is a corporate strategy in the 21st century. To better understand the challenges of diversity management, the themes revealed that leaders' good moral values matter, and the researcher believes that further studies on the moral values of managers and how they influence leadership behaviors are necessary. This study has helped the researcher explore the causes of a lack of a strategy for managing diversity in the workplace, which is organizational context-dependent. Summary and Study Conclusion      This research investigated the impact a lack of a leadership strategy in managing diversity has in today’s diverse workforce. The general and specific problem studied is a possibility of a failure of a leadership strategy for managing diversity resulting in decreased workers' job satisfaction, well-being, organizational success, and representation of women and ethnic minorities in senior leadership positions. The study reviewed three topics related to qualitative research: the research design, methods, and triangulation. Throughout this study, the researcher described the paradigms and the research methodology employed to view the general and specific problem to be addressed by using evidence from the discovered themes and patterns of a lack of leadership for managing diversity in a West African organization operating in the security industry using the latest technology. The researcher recognized the fallibility of any method by triangulating in terms of validity by relying upon different sources of data collection, such as interviews, surveys, observations, and organizational documents, to collaborate on the results. The research design is the framework that guides the strategy or methodology for implementation. The framework and its parts are the backbones, the guiding light of the study. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 188 This research used a case study with a flexible design to research a unique organization in West Africa.      This study explored strategic leadership's impact on managing diversity through the lenses of integration, leadership, inclusiveness, equity, and leaders' moral values. Research revealed that organizations that embrace inclusiveness, cultivate cultural competencies, can reduce discriminatory tendencies toward marginalized groups, and build confidence among teams. Several leadership styles have proved their efficacity in promoting diversity in the workplace. These styles include inclusive leadership, transformational leadership, charismatic leadership, and social leadership, to name a few. The study described the population and sampling used in qualitative research design, representing the foundation. The population comprised employees working in an organization in West Africa and included 15 participants. The sample from this population includes executive leaders, middle managers, supervisors, and subordinates. The researcher used a nonprobability sampling approach, a purposive sample combined with a probability sampling focusing on homogenous and critical case sampling.      This particular study investigated the lack of leadership strategy in managing diversity resulting in the inability of organizations to make strategic changes to gain competitive advantages in an era of rapidly shifting demographics in the workplace. The research used NVivo, a qualitative software analysis tool, to organize the data for patterns discovery. Interviews, surveys, notes, memo writings, and archival documents were used for the data collection, allowing the research to integrate real-world events and adhere to standard ethical practices underpinning the process. The data analysis process involved organizing, assigning codes to themes to data sets, such as notes, transcripts, memos, etc., and finding patterns that help generate meanings. The validity and reliability of the qualitative data refer to the correctness STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 189 and credibility of the account's description, interpretation, and explanation; they are consistent with its use in qualitative research to avoid severe philosophical problems.      The participants in this study have contributed a great deal of information for practitioners and managers around the globe concerning the strategies leaders in the global business environment in managing a diverse workforce. Based on their work experiences and relationships with their leadership team and their co-workers from different backgrounds and cultural mixes, the participants described what they thought would benefit managers of a diverse workforce. They felt that leaders’ moral values are essential in managing diversity. They also believed that leaders’ cultural competencies are necessary to manage diversity effectively. They discussed the impact globalization and nationalism have in the workplace, the benefits and adverse effects diversity can bring in organizations, or can gain by promoting an inclusive climate. Summary      The specific and general problem to be addressed is the lack of possible failure of a leadership strategy for managing diversity resulting in decreased workers' job satisfaction, well-being, organizational success, and representation of women and ethnic minorities in senior leadership positions. Throughout this research project, the researcher has learned a great deal about diversity in the workplace and interacted with beautiful people who love their jobs despite getting the respect they deserve. (English Standard Version Bible, 2001, 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13) teach \"to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work, and be at peace among yourselves.\" Many participants in the study stressed the need for leaders to operate based on sound moral values, respect, honesty, and fairness toward their employees, members of a diverse STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 190 workforce. The researcher learned that leading a diverse force is not comparable or equated to an equal opportunity from the era of civil rights acts or discrimination and harassment. Those scholars who think so are missing the point about diversity management. Of course, equal opportunity, discrimination, and harassment are issues that managers need to pay attention to; but managing diversity is not confined by these terms alone. The strategies for managing diversity have no boundaries; they transcend human life. STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP FOR MANAGING DIVERSITY 191 References Adiguzel, Z., & Cakir, F. S. (2020).
