Scott6,7,16,17AbstractThis study presents the most comprehensive national prevalence estimates of diverse gender and sexuality identities inAustralians, and the associations with five separate types of child maltreatment and their overlap (multi-type maltreatment).Using Australian Child Maltreatment Study (ACMS) data (N = 8503), 9.5% of participants identified with a diverse sexuality and.9% with a diverse gender. Diverse identities were more prevalent in the youth cohort, with 17.7% of 16–24 years oldsidentifying with a diverse sexuality and 2.3% with a diverse gender. Gender and sexuality diversity also intersect – for example,with women (aged 16–24 and 25–44) more likely than men to identify as bisexual. The prevalence of physical abuse, sexualabuse, emotional abuse, neglect and exposure to domestic violence was very high for those with diverse sexuality and/or genderidentities. Maltreatment was most prevalent for participants in the youth cohort with diverse gender identities (90.5% ex-periencing some form of child maltreatment; 77% multi-type maltreatment) or diverse sexualities (85.3% reporting any childmaltreatment; 64.3% multi-type maltreatment). The strong association found between child maltreatment and diverse sexualityand gender identities is critical for understanding the social and mental health vulnerabilities of these groups, and informingservices needed to support them.Keywordssexual orientation, non-binary, diverse, gender, sexuality, child maltreatment1Institute of Child Protection Studies, Australian Catholic University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia2School of Population Health, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia3School of Law, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia4Parenting and Family Support Centre, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia5Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA6QIMR Berghofer, Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia7Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, Wacol, QLD, Australia8School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia9Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA10Crimes against Children Research Center, Department of Sociology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA11Institute for Lifecourse Development, University of Greenwich, London, UK12School of Social & Political Science, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK13Faculty of Humanities, North-West University, Vanderbijlpark, South Africa14School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa15Faculty of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia16Child and Youth Mental Health Service, Children’s Health QLD, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia17Child Health Research Centre, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, AustraliaCorresponding Author:Daryl J. Higgins, Institute of Child Protection Studies, Australian Catholic University, 115 Victoria Parade, Melbourne, Australia.Email: Daryl.Higgins@acu.edu.auIntroductionChild maltreatment is the leading modifiable cause of mentaland substance use disorders (Teicher et al., 2022) and itsprevention is therefore a critical public health imperativeglobally. Although some countries such as the UK (Radfordet al., 2013) and the US (Finkelhor et al., 2015) have nationaldata about the prevalence of different types of maltreat-ment, few nations have conducted nationally representativesurveys to establish prevalence rates of the five forms ofchild maltreatment—sexual abuse, physical abuse, emo-tional abuse, neglect, and exposure to domestic violence–experienced across childhood from age 0–18 (Mathewset al., 2020). Few look at the overalap of different adverti-sies, particularly the prevalence of mult-type maltreatment.Unfortnately, most epidemiological research simply reportschild maltreatment prevalence data using a binary genderclassification (i.e., men and women) ignoring those identi-fying with diverse genders.1 In fact, people with diversegenders are a substantially underrepresented population inresearch in general (Rushton et al., 2019). Similarly, attentionto diverse sexuality identities has not been well addressed inprior child maltreatment prevalence estimates globally and hasnot featured in previous Australian prevalence assessments(Dunne et al., 2003).Young people who identify with diverse genders or sex-ualities have been reported to experience higher levels ofsexual violence than the general population (Ybarra et al.,2022) and are at high risk for other adversity across life in-cluding mental health disorders and bullying (Toomey &Russell, 2016). To the best of our knowledge, no Austra-lian study has examined either the national prevalence ofdiverse sexuality and gender identities or the extent to whichthese populations report having experienced maltreatment inchildhood.Prevalence of Diverse Genders and Sexualitiesin AustraliaGender Identity. Gender identity is distinct from sex (The Sexand Gender Sensitive Research Call to Action Group, 2020).Sex (including sex assigned at birth) is based on a person’sbiological sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs orchromosomes (ABS, 2021). Sex falls into three categories:male, female and intersex. In contrast, gender identity is asocial and cultural identity. Gender may differ from sex as-signed at birth (Heidari et al., 2016). Common gender iden-tities include man, woman, boy, girl, and non-binary, but alsoextend to transgender and gender diverse. Following estab-lished convention, we refer to persons whose gender and sexmatch as cisgender (McIntyre, 2018). Here, we use the term“diverse gender identities” to refer to those who are notcisgender – including trans and non-binary people (AIDSCouncil of New South Wales (ACON), 2019; Lyons et al.,2021).In their cross-sectional US study of 4193 youth recruitedvia social media, Ybarra et al. (2022) reported that 13.9% oftheir self-selected participants identified as non-binary,questioning, unsure about their gender, or being of transgenderexperience; 7.9% identified as transgender boys or girls; and78.3% were cisgendered. Although these are important data,recruiting participants via social media may lead to results thatare not representative. As with the US, there have been nonationally representative prevalence data on gender diversityin Australia to date. The most recent national 5-yearly Censusfrom the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) conducted in2021 did include the option to select a gender other than maleor female (selected by .17%), but was widely criticised asflawed for being too general and only capturing those whoidentify with the specific identity of ‘non-binary’ (Lyons et al.,2021). The ABS (2022a) noted that it “cannot be used as ameasure of gender diversity, non-binary genders or transpopulations” (p. 1). In sum, we have little accurate repre-sentative data about population prevalence of diverse genderidentities in Australia.Sexuality Diversity. We use the term “diverse sexuality iden-tities” to describe those who are not sexually attracted to thebinary “opposite sex” (i.e., heterosexual). Some refer to thisgroup as “sexual minority persons” (APA, 2021). We willinclude all other sexual identities or orientations in our cat-egory of ‘diverse sexuality identities’. This includes those whoare same-sex attracted, as well as also those who may beattracted to all genders (i.e., pansexual), those attracted to nogender (i.e., asexual), and those with a range of other sexualityidentities. Finally, we acknowledge that although genderidentity and sexuality identity are distinct constructs, theyobviously intersect. As noted by ACON (2019), “trans andgender diverse people have any sexual orientation includingheterosexual, queer, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, asex-ual” (p. 2).Although some researchers now adopt the term “sexual andgender minority (SGM)” to encompass both, the risk of usingthe term ‘minority’ is to encourage ‘othering’ from the het-erosexual cisgender norm. Although using the concept of‘diversity’ can still run this risk, we prefer it as a more in-clusive term “sexuality and gender diverse”. People withdiverse gender and/or sexuality identities may also bemembers of other identity groups, such as AboriginalLGBTIQA+ people (Liddelow-Hunt et al., 2021).Using three Australian nationally representative householdsurveys, namely the General Social Survey (GSS, conducted in2014), and two waves of the Household, Income And LabourDynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey (2012 and 2016),Wilson et al. (2020) estimated that in Australia, 3.6% of menand 3.4% of women described themselves with a diversesexuality identity. Interestingly, they reported important inter-sections between sexuality and gender identities. For example,they found that the gay population was larger than the bisexualpopulation for men (182,100 and 77,900 respectively), but the2 Child Maltreatment 0(0)opposite was true for women (104,400 lesbian and137,800 bisexual). Importantly, they found a higher pro-portion of younger people reporting a diverse sexualityidentity (Wilson et al., 2020). Although the ABS Censuscaptured data on those living in same-sex relationships (1.4%of all couples living together in Australia in 2021), it did notmeasure sexuality identity (ABS, 2022b). A growing body ofresearch about diverse sexuality and gender identities hashighlighted the need for guidelines on good practice inresearch in this area. Heidari et al. (2016) developed a newguideline for Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER)designed to ensure this research is sensitively, accurately, andconsistently described – and is not confounded by othersocio-economic factors. To implement this, they argued thatin epidemiological studies, “the impact of other exposures,such as socio-economic variables, on health problems shouldbe examined for all genders and should be analysed criticallyfrom a gender perspective” (p. 5). The same may be true fordiverse sexuality identities.International Data on Gender Diversity, SexualityDiversity, and Child MaltreatmentViolence against children exists in relation to multiple andintersecting structural and systemic forms of discrimination,such as racism, colonialism, ableism, poverty and classism,homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, and ageism that affectthe vulnerability of children. However, there has been littleattention documenting the prevalence of child maltreatmentexperiences of diverse Australians, primarily due to the lack ofreliable population prevalence data about Australians whoidentify as having a diverse sexuality or a diverse genderidentity – such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex,queer, asexual and other gender/sexual minorities(LGBTIQA+) (Victorian Government, 2022). A recent reviewof 17 Australian studies found only 7 that included items onboth gender and sexuality identity and that none of these werenationally representative (Saxby, 2022).In the US, a recent small-scale non-representative study ofsexuality diverse young adults from two urban areas showedthat adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including childmaltreatment, were frequently reported – with 91.3% re-porting at least one ACE, such as peer isolation/rejection(71.2%), emotional neglect (54.1%), and emotional abuse(51.1%) (Grocott et al., 2023). In their systematic review,Tobin and Delaney (2019) observed that those who displaygender non-conforming traits in childhood or who aretransgender are at greater risk for child abuse and adversehealth and wellbeing consequences. Ybarra et al. (2022) foundthat compared to cisgender youths, those with diverse genderidentities (i.e., transgender and non-binary) were more thantwice as likely to have experienced sexual violence. Similarly,Newcomb et al. (2020) found that transgender, non-binary,and gender diverse youth were at greater risk of mental healthproblems, substance use, and violence. In arguing how genderand sexuality diversity can lead to adverse outcomes, Rafferty(2021) noted that“adverse outcomes among stigmatized populations emergethrough 2 forces: distal stressors from the external social envi-ronment (e.g., discrimination, stigma, abuse, and violence) andinternal proximal stressors (e.g., fear of rejection, suppressingone’s identity, or internalizing negative beliefs about one’sidentity)” (p. 2).Although researchers have concluded that gender plays animportant role in risk of having experienced child sexual abuse(e.g., McPhillips et al., 2022), the focus has been almostexclusively on the gender binary of man/woman. There hasbeen less attention on gender in relation to other forms of childmaltreatment, with gender minorities being largely ignored inunderstanding the experience, impact, treatment and pre-vention of child abuse and neglect.Based on their systematic review of 32 studies of youthswith sexuality diverse identities, McGeough and Sterzing(2018) concluded that compared to heterosexual youths,they experience substantially higher rates of family victimi-zation, particularly bisexual youths. They also found thatsexual minorities who experienced childhood abuse reportedmore frequent physical, mental, and health-related behaviorproblems, compared to both heterosexual or non-abusedsexual minority peers who had not experienced family vic-timization. Although sexuality diverse youths’ experiences offamily victimization were associated with adverse healthoutcomes, the strength of this association for youths withsexuality diversity may be different from those with diversegender identities (McGeough & Sterzing, 2018).In a recent cross-sectional US study of youths with datacollected via social media, Mitchell et al. (2023) found thatSGM youths experience disproportionately higher levels ofpolyvictimization, and the relationship between any individualform of victimisation and the outcomes they measured (de-pression; substance misuse) were attenuated after accountingfor polyvictimisation. This highlights the importance ofmeasuring and accounting for multiple forms of victimisationwhen trying to understand whether and how sexual/genderminority individuals are affected.Studies on child-, parent-, and contextual-level risk factorsfor child maltreatment in the family typically show higherrates of child maltreatment in youths with diverse sexualityidentities than for their heterosexual peers (e.g., Higgins &Hunt, 2023; Prior et al., 2021). Higher rates of physical andemotional abuse have been found to be related to disclosure ofsexual orientation, younger age at first awareness of same-sexattraction, and same-sex sexual contact; and sexual andemotional abuse were associated with gender non-conformity(McGeough & Sterzing, 2018). Prior et al. (2021) found thatwhen compared to their female peers, transgender and genderdiverse groups were three times more likely to experienceHiggins et al. 3emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and emotional/physical neglect and compared to male peers, were over threetimes more likely to experience emotional abuse, sexualabuse, and neglect.In a recent US study, Schnarrs et al. (2022) found thatadults who identify as sexual and gender diverse commonlyreport childhood adversities—emotional abuse (56.1%),physical abuse (54.6%), and sexual abuse (46.2%), emotionalneglect (61.6%), physical neglect (46.9%) and domestic vi-olence (47.3%). Similarly, Jiang et al. (2023) found that 12.2%of undergraduate students in mainland China in their studyself-identified as LGBQ, and that rates of childhood mal-treatment were significantly higher in sexual minorities thanheterosexuals. They found that emotional abuse, emotionalneglect, and sexual abuse (but not physical abuse or physicalneglect) were significantly associated with LGBQ identity(and with depression) in students. The likelihood, and natureof, experiencing discrimination, harassment and structuraloppression—and the fear of being outed, or subjected toviolence—for youths with diverse gender identities may bedifferent to those with diverse sexuality identities, and mayalso intersect (for those identifying as both non-heterosexualand non-cisgendered).Researchers have focused on the greater physical andmental disorder burdens on gender and sexuality diversepeople (e.g., Lucassen et al., 2017). In a national US onlinestudy of adolescents, Thoma et al. (2021) observed thattransgender adolescents reported higher rates of psychologi-cal, physical, and sexual abuse than their heterosexual cis-gender counterparts. They found the greatest likelihood ofhaving experienced psychological abuse for transgender ad-olescents assigned female at birth. Meyer (2003) proposed theidea of ‘minority stress’ to explain how for lesbians, gay men,and bisexuals, “stigma, prejudice, and discrimination create ahostile and stressful social environment that causes mentalhealth problems” (p. 674). However, the reverse could also betrue – that early signs of mental health problems could placegender diverse or sexuality diverse children/youth at risk forchild maltreatment (see Roberts et al., 2013).Researchers have already shown those with sexuality and/or gender diverse identities have higher risk of a range ofadverse outcomes including homelessness, health risk factors(like substance use, e.g., Hughes et al., 2010) and negativemental health conditions such as depression (e.g., McNairet al., 2011; Randell & Scanlan, 2019). However, these re-searchers have not tested to see whether those with diverseidentities in Australia differ from cisgender or heterosexualpeople in terms of their experiences of child maltreatment.McNair et al. (2011) highlighted the need for research toexamine the social determinants of physical and mental healthdisparities that women with diverse sexualities experience.Child maltreatment is a major contributor to poor health,health risk behavior and poor mental health outcomes inadulthood (Lawrence et al., 2023; Pacella et al., 2023; Scottet al., 2023). Therefore, it is important to understand whethersuch ACEs explain at least in part the increased risk of adversehealth and wellbeing outcomes.The Australian Child Maltreatment Study. The Australian ChildMaltreatment Study (ACMS) is the first nationally repre-sentative study of adults’ retrospective reports of all five formsof child maltreatment in Australia (Mathews et al., 2021). TheACMS provides the most rigorous population-level estimatesof both gender and sexuality identities and child maltreatment,enables examination of age cohort differences (i.e., seculartrends), and facilitates an exploration of any association be-tween child maltreatment and gender/sexuality diversity. Asdetailed in the ACMS protocol (Mathews et al., 2021) andmethodology (Haslam et al., 2023), the survey was designedto: (a) estimate the prevalence of all five types of childmaltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse,neglect, and exposure to domestic violence) in the generalpopulation; (b) determine changes over time (i.e., betweendifferent age cohorts); (c) identify associations with mentalhealth disorders, physical health, health risk behaviors, healthservice utilisation, and other outcomes such as intimatepartner violence in adulthood and involvement in the criminaljustice system. The demographic items on self-reportedgender and sexuality identity in the ACMS provide aunique opportunity to explore these issues in a population-representative sample of Australians.Prevalence of Child Maltreatment in AustraliaData from the ACMS are consistent with international studiesshowing comparably high rates of child maltreatment(Mathews, Meinck et al., 2023). Similar representativecommunity studies show that it is considerably more prevalentthan the cases of abuse and neglect that are substantiated bystatutory child protection agencies (e.g., Mills et al., 2016).Reporting on data from ACMS for the general population,Higgins et al. (2023) found 62% of the population experiencedsome type of maltreatment during childhood. Rates of specifictypes of maltreatment ranged from 8.9% (neglect) to 39.6%(exposure to domestic violence) (Mathews, Pacella et al.,2023). Single-type maltreatment was less common thanmulti-type maltreatment (22.8% cf. 39.4%) (Higgins et al.,2023). Child maltreatment was strongly associated with healthrisk behaviors (Lawrence et al., 2023), mental health dis-orders (Scott et al., 2023) and health service utilisation(Pacella et al., 2023). Participants with diverse gender iden-tities had higher prevalence rates of child maltreatmentcompared to the full sample. This was true for all five types:physical abuse (49.9% cf. 32.0%), sexual abuse (51.9% cf.28.5%), emotional abuse (58.3% cf. 30.9%), neglect (26.4%cf. 8.9%) and exposure to domestic violence (58.2% cf.39.6%) (Mathews, Pacella et al., 2023) and for multi-typemaltreatment (Higgins et al., 2023). Due to the comparativelylow number of people identifying with diverse genderscompared to those identifying as men or women, analysis of4 Child Maltreatment 0(0)gender diversity was not incorporated into previously pub-lished data from the ACMS (Mathews, Pacella et al., 2023).Our paper harnesses an existing nationally representativestudy of child maltreatment in Australia to address this gap bycalculating prevalence rates of Australians identifying withdiverse sexualities and/or genders, and the rates of childmaltreatment across these groups. We build on the existingbody of work on the prevalence of child maltreatment inAustralia by specifically focusing on those Australians whoidentify with a diverse gender and those with diversesexualities.Our three broad aims were to:1. Estimate the prevalence of people with diverse genderidentities in the population in Australia, and by agecohort.2. Estimate the prevalence of people with diverse sexu-ality identities in the population in Australia, and byage cohort and diverse genders; and3. Measure the associations between gender/sexualityidentities and child maltreatment (and to determineif these are influenced by socio-economic status) byestimating the prevalence of child maltreatment andmulti-type child maltreatment in Australians with di-verse gender identities and diverse sexuality identities.MethodThis study used a cross-sectional retrospective interviewadministered via computer assisted telephone interviewing.The full methodology and sample of the ACMS has beendescribed in detail elsewhere (see Haslam et al., 2023). Briefly,the full sample included 8503 participants, which included anover-representation of young people aged 16–24 years of age(referred to as the ‘youth cohort’) as well as 1000 participantsfrom each decadal age cohort after (i.e., 25–34, 35–44 throughto 65 years and older). For the purposes of the analyses re-ported here, we grouped two age deciles to create a middle-aged cohort (25–44 years) and three to create an older cohort(aged 45+). The sample was tested for representativenessagainst Australian Census data and national health data andreceived minor weightings for adjustment. The sample wasalso tested for evidence of potential bias towards those with ahistory of maltreatment and none was observed. These aredetailed elsewhere (see Haslam et al., 2023).Ethical approval was sought from the lead institution’sHuman Research Ethics Committee (1900000477). Partici-pants were recruited via random digit dialling methodologyusing a fully mobile sampling frame. A computer programrandomly generated legitimate Australian mobile numbersbased on known Australian mobile prefixes. This ensured allrecruited numbers were totally random. Selected numbersreceived an advance text message outlining the study with alink the study Web site. Interviewers called the randomlygenerated numbers and invited those who answered toparticipate. Those who chose to participate provided verbalconsent and completed the interview via phone. Distress andwelfare protocols are briefly outlined inMathews et al. (2021).MeasuresWe developed items to measure gender and sexuality identitiesafter consultation with experts, closely aligned to the newstandards outlined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS,2021), which is responsible for the 10-yearly national census, anda range of other key government surveys and national datacollections. However, ACMS items provide substantially moreresponse options than the ABS standard against which inter-viewers could code responses. Although we have treated peoplewho identify with diverse genders and those who identify withdiverse sexualities as fully distinct for all analyses, we use theterm “diverse gender and sexuality identities” for ease ofcommunication when describing both populations.To obtain participants’ gender identity, interviewersasked: “How would you describe your gender?” This wasdeliberately an open-response question to avoid bias. In-terviewers coded from a set of response codes includingmale/cisgender man, female/cisgender woman, transwoman, trans man, trans femme, transmasculine, genderqueer, gender diverse, non-binary, sister girl, brother boy,agender, or “I prefer not to have a label”. Any responses thatcould not be categorised were recorded verbatim and latercoded by hand based on the closest fit to the responseoptions. If someone responded as being a ‘man’ or a‘woman’, we did not ask if they were cisgender or their sexassigned at birth. Therefore some non-cisgendered men/women may be included in the categories of ‘man’ or‘woman’. However, if someone reported they were ‘cis-gender’, interviewers asked them to confirm if they were aman or woman. Given the concepts of sex and gender areoften—albeit incorrectly—viewed as interchangeable, wecategorised anyone who responded saying ‘male’ as a man,and those responding saying ‘female’ as a woman.To obtain participants’ sexuality identity, interviewersasked: “How would you describe your sexuality?” Responsecodes included heterosexual or straight, gay or lesbian, bi-sexual, queer, asexual, pansexual, ‘I prefer not to have a label’,and other (recorded verbatim).The ACMS used the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire –R2: Adapted Version (ACMS) (Mathews, Meinck et al., 2023)to assess experiences of child maltreatment. This included17 screener items (yes/no response option) across five key do-mains of maltreatment: physical abuse (2 items, e.g., Did an adultever hit, punch, kick or physically hurt you?), sexual abuse(5 items, e.g., Did anyone ever look at your private parts whenthey shouldn’t have or make you look at theirs?), emotionalabuse (3 items, e.g., Did your parents often ignore you, or notshow you love and affection?), neglect (3 items, e.g., Were youever not provided with regular meals, baths or showers or cleanclothes?), and exposure to domestic violence (4 items, e.g., DidHiggins et al. 5you ever see or hear one of your parents get pushed, hit, choked,or beaten up by your other parent or their partner?). All itemshave previously been reported and show good psychometricproperties (Haslam et al., 2023; Mathews, Pacella et al., 2023).The measure used behaviorally specific questions that did notrequire respondents to self-identify with a victim category, butsimply to answer yes or no to whether during childhood they hadexperienced the relevant behavior. For emotional abuse andneglect, only experiences that lastedmore than a week counted inour prevalence estimates. Follow-up items (not analysed in thecurrent study) provided additional details regarding the nature ofthe maltreatment.Socio-economic status was assessed using the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of RelativeSocio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage (ABS, 2018)based on the participant’s postcode (like a US ZIP code) ofresidence at the time of the survey. This index, generated bythe ABS ranks geographic areas in terms of relative advantageand disadvantage using Census data on a variety of socio-economic factors such as the number of low income and high-income households and the number of skilled and unskilledworkers residing in an area. This index was used to split thesample into five quintiles where the lowest quintile representsthe most disadvantaged and the least advantaged locations.Statistical AnalysisAs recommended by the SAGER guidelines (Heidari et al., 2016),we conducted gender- and sexuality-sensitive analyses of pop-ulation prevalence of identity types, prevalence of child mal-treatment, and the association between the two. Participants wereconsidered to identify with a diverse gender if they responded inany way other than man or woman. Participants were consideredto be sexually diverse if they responded in any way other thanheterosexual or straight. Participants were considered to haveexperienced child maltreatment if they experienced any of the fivetypes ofmaltreatment prior to age 18 years (the age of adulthood inAustralia). We categorised experiences of multi-type maltreatmentif they had experienced more than one of the five types of childmaltreatment, or severe multi-type maltreatment if they had ex-perienced more than two of the five types (Higgins et al., 2023).We calculated weighted prevalence estimates of diverse genderand sexuality identities, and calculated prevalence of each type ofmaltreatment, overall maltreatment and multi-type maltreatmentby diverse sexuality and gender identities.We then tested whether associations between gender/sexuality identities and child maltreatment are influencedby socio-economic status. We calculated prevalence of diversegender and sexuality identities. Finally, we used logistic re-gression to calculate odds ratios for experience of each type ofchild maltreatment for women and diverse genders relative tomen, and for diverse sexualities relative to heterosexual orstraight adjusting for SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage.We used weighted survey data to represent the estimatedresident population of Australia aged 16 years and over as at30 June 2021 (Haslam et al., 2023). Compared to the2016 Australian census, the survey sample was represen-tative of the Australian population by region, remoteness,Indigenous status, marital status, and gender (noting thatonly male/female gender options were used in the2016 census). However, survey participants were morelikely to be born in Australia and have higher income,socio-economic status and level of education. We alsoapplied survey weights that accounted for the differentsample sizes in age strata (the survey was designed to have ahigher representation of people aged 16–24 years) andpatterns of non-response as described in Haslam et al.(2023). Confidence Intervals (CIs) for all estimates arereported and were calculated using the Surveyfreq proce-dure in SAS Version 9.4. Tests of statistical significance(where 95% CIs do not overlap) of difference in proportionswere undertaken comparing both men and women withdiverse gender identities and heterosexual or straight withdiverse sexuality identities. Logistic regression modelswere fitted, accounting for the complex survey design usingthe Surveylogistic procedure in SAS Version 9.4. In total,17 participants either said they didn’t know or refused toprovide their gender.2 These participants have been in-cluded in “all diverse genders” subtotals to highlight dif-ferences with those who know and identify either as male orfemale. A much larger group of participants (n = 124) saidthey either did not know or refused to provide their sex-uality identity. Because of size of this group, “don’t know/refused” was treated as a separate category for sexualityidentity, rather than included in subtotals.ResultsPrevalence of Diverse Genders in theAustralian PopulationAlmost 1% of the sample (n = 126) reported a diverse genderidentity (see Table 1). The vast majority of these participantswere in the youth cohort, where 2.3% of the youth identified asa diverse gender category (n = 90). By far, the most commonresponse category endorsed by youth participants was non-binary (n = 57); however, 13 identified as gender fluid, and10 preferred not to have a label. When weighted to representthe population of Australia 16 years and over, we estimatedthat almost 200,000 Australians have diverse gender identi-ties, including 65,300 young people aged 16–24 years.Prevalence of Diverse Sexuality Identities in theAustralian PopulationNext, we calculated the prevalence of Australians who identifywith one of the diverse sexuality identity categories (Table 2).6 Child Maltreatment 0(0)Table1.EstimatedPrevalenceofGenderIdentitiesinAustraliansAged16YearsandOlder,byGenderIdentitybyAgeGroup.GenderIdentityPrevalencebygenderidentityandagegroup16–24Years25–44Years45YearsorMoreTotalnWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CIPrevalencebygenderidentityandagegroupMale/Men174849.1(47.2–50.9)99249.7(47.2–52.1)145546.9(44.9–48.9)419548.1(46.8–49.5)Female/Women166248.6(46.8–50.5)98649.3(46.8–51.7)153452.6(50.6–54.6)418250.9(49.5–52.3)Non-binary521.3(.9–1.7)50.2aaa570.3(.2–.3)Genderfluid80.2(.1–.4)50.3(.0–.5)0a130.1(.0–.2)Genderdiverse3a0a0a3aGenderqueer1a1a0a2aTransman50.1(.0–.2)2a0a70.1(.0–.1)Transmasculine2a2a0a4aSistergirl2a1a1a4aTranswoman1a2a1a4aTransfemme0a0a1a1aIprefernottohavealabel4a2a4a100.1(.0–.2)Other4a0a0a4aDon’tknow/refused80.3(.1–.4)2a70.3(.1–.5)170.2(.1–.3)Alldiversegendersb902.3(1.8–2.9)221.1(.6–1.6)140.5(.2–.8)1260.9(.7–1.2)GenderIdentityEstimatedpopulationsizebygenderidentityandagegroup16–24Years25–44Years45YearsorMoreTotalEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIMale/Men1,380,000(1,310,000–1,440,000)3,610,000(3,380,000–3,850,000)4,950,000(4,690,000–5,220,000)9,950,000(9,600,000–10,300,000)Female/Women1,360,000(1,300,000–1,430,000)3,580,000(3,350,000–3,820,000)5,570,000(5,280,000–5,860,000)10,500,000(10,200,000–10,900,000)Non-binary37,200(25,700–48,600)15,900(1,400–30,400)a53,100(34,600–71,600)Alldiversegendersb65,300(50,500–80,100)78,200(42,000–114,000)52,700(22,200–83,200)196,000(147,000–245,000)Note.Intheircomputer-assistedcodingscheme,interviewershadtwootherterms,‘brotherboy’and‘Agender’theycouldhaveused,norespondentswerecodedwiththisgenderidentity,andsotheyarenotincludedascolumnsinthistable.a Notpublishedasfewerthanfivesampleparticipants.b Alldiversegenders(otherthanmenandwomen).Note:Intheircomputer-assistedcodingscheme,interviewershadtwootherterms,‘brotherboy’and‘Agender’theycouldhaveused,norespondentswerecodedwiththisgenderidentity,andsotheyarenotincludedascolumnsinthistable.Higgins et al. 7Table2.PrevalenceofSexualIdentitiesinAustraliansAged16YearsandOlder,byAgeGroup.SexualIdentityAgeGroup16–24Years25–44Years45YearsorMoreTotalNWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CIPrevalencebysexualidentityandagegroupHeterosexualorstraight282081.1(79.6–82.5)176788.4(86.8–89.9)283394.4(93.5–95.4)742090.5(89.7–91.2)Gayorlesbian982.4(1.9–3.0)602.9(2.1–3.6)491.4(.9–1.8)2072.1(1.7–2.4)Bisexual35310.0(8.9–11.1)864.3(3.3–5.2)331.0(.6–1.3)4723.4(2.9–3.8)Queer300.8(.5–1.1)130.5(.2–.9)1a440.3(.2–.4)Asexual401.0(.7–1.3)60.3(.0–.6)80.3(.1–.5)540.4(.2–.6)Pansexual722.0(1.5–2.5)201.0(.5–1.5)50.1(.0–.2)970.7(.5–.9)Iprefernottohavealabel361.1(.7–1.5)120.6(.2–1.0)180.5(.2–.8)660.6(.4–.8)Other120.4(.1–.7)3a4a190.2(.1–.3)Sexuallydiverseb64117.7(16.4–19.1)2009.8(8.4–11.2)1183.5(2.7–4.2)9597.6(7.0–8.3)Don’tknow/refused391.2(.8–1.6)331.8(1.2–2.5)522.1(1.5–2.7)1241.9(1.5–2.3)SexualIdentityEstimatedpopulationsizebygenderidentityandagegroup16–24Years25–44Years45YearsorMoreTotalEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIEstimate95%CIHeterosexualorstraight2,270,000(2,190,000–2,360,000)6,430,000(6,130,000–6,730,000)9,990,000(9,600,000–10,300,000)18,700,000(18,300,000–19,100,000)Gayorlesbian68,700(53,900–83,600)208,000(151,000–266,000)147,000(99,000–195,000)424,000(349,000–500,000)Bisexual282,000(250,000–314,000)311,000(240,000–382,000)102,000(62,000–142,000)694,000(607,000–781,000)Queer21,200(12,900–29,500)40,000(17,000–62,900)a64,000(39,000–89,000)Asexual27,800(18,700–36,900)22,300(3,000–41,600)32,600(7,900–57,400)82,700(50,000–115,000)Pansexual55,700(41,800–69,600)73,000(38,000–108,000)10,800(600–20,900)139,000(101,000–178,000)Iprefernottohavealabel31,300(20,000–42,600)43,400(17,400–69,400)54,500(24,900–84,100)129,000(88,000–170,000)Other11,200(4,000–18,300)aa42,600(13,800–71,400)Sexuallydiverseb498,000(457,000–539,000)713,000(606,000–820,000)366,000(289,000–442,000)1,580,000(1,440,000–1,710,000)Don’tknow/refused33,800(21,900–45,600)134,000(84,000–183,000)223,000(155,000–291,000)390,000(306,000–475,000)a Notpublishedasfewerthanfivesampleparticipants.b Includesallsexualidentitiesexceptheterosexualorstraightanddon’tknow/refused.8 Child Maltreatment 0(0)Excluding those who refused to answer or didn’t know (n =124; 1.9%), 90.5% of the population identified as heterosexualor straight, and 9.5% as sexuality diverse. Significantly morewomen than men had diverse sexuality identities. As withgender diversity, there were significant age cohort differences.The highest proportion of sexuality diversity was for thoseaged 16–24 (17.7%). This was significantly higher than thoseaged 25–44 years (9.8%), which also was significantly higherthan in those aged 45 years and over (7.6%).The most common diverse sexuality identity reportedoverall was bisexual (3.4%). This held true for the young (16–24) and middle-aged (25–44) cohorts. However, in the older-age cohort (45 years and over), gay or lesbian was the mostfrequently sexuality diverse identity (1.4%) – just slightly (butnot significantly) higher than bisexual (1.1%). In Table 2, wealso provide population estimates of the number of Australianswith sexuality diverse identities. We estimate that there arealmost 1.6 million Australians who identify as sexualitydiverse.We also explored the intersection between sexualityidentity and gender identity. However, due to small cell sizes,we collapsed gender into three categories: men, women, anddiverse genders. These data are shown in Table 3. Signifi-cantly more men than women and/or gender diverse indi-viduals identified as heterosexual. Across the entire sample,the percentage identifying as gay or lesbian was almost doublefor men (2.6%) compared to women (1.4%). The reverse wastrue for bisexual, queer and pansexual identities. For example,there were significantly more bisexuals who were genderdiverse, followed by women and then by men. The rate ofbisexuiality for women (4.3%) was almost double that of men(2.2%). The pattern is most pronounced for the youth cohort,where 14.9% of women identified as bisexual.Association Between Child Maltreatment and DiverseGender IdentitiesAs shown in Table 4, the prevalence of child maltreatmentexperienced by women was significantly higher than men foremotional abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. (There were nosignificant differences between men and women for physicalabuse and exposure to domestic violence). However, for allfive maltreatment types, the prevalence for the diverse gendercategory was significantly higher than for women, which inturn was significantly higher than for men. The pattern wasevident for physical abuse and neglect, but was strongest forsexual abuse: 51.9% of participants with diverse gendershaving experienced sexual abuse, compared to 37.3% ofwomen and 18.8% of men. We found a similar pattern forexperiencing any type of child maltreatment, with the lowestprevalence for men (58.4%), significantly higher for women(65.5%), and significantly higher yet again for those withdiverse gender identities (81.5%). It is striking that relation-ship between child maltreatment and diverse gender identitieswas evident across age groups. Across all gender identitycategories, the youth cohort had considerably higher preva-lence of each form of child maltreatment, and of multi-typemaltreatment, than both older age cohorts (we were unable toreport the exact numbers due to cell sizes being below thethreshold for reporting of n = 5). There appears to be nosignificant age-group differences in the comparative risk ofeach and any child maltreatment by diverse gender identities.A much stronger pattern was evident when individualsexperienced two or more types of child maltreatment (multi-type maltreatment). Gender diverse indiviuals were signifi-cantly more likely to experience multi-type maltreatment thanwomen, who were significantly more likely to experience itthan men (see Table 5). The prevalence of severe multi-typemaltreatment (three or more types) in those with a diversegender identity was almost double (51.2%) the rate for women(27.6%), which was significantly higher than for men (18.1%).For multi-type maltreatment (2 or more types), the pattern wassimilar, although not quite as strong as for severe multi-typemaltreatment (3 or more types). The strong pattern was drivenin part by the very strong associations and signitificant dif-ferences found for the youth cohort, but was less strong for the25–44, and 45 years and over age groups (see Table 5).Association Between Child Maltreatment and DiverseSexuality IdentitiesWe calculated the prevalence of each of the five domains ofchild maltreatment, the experience of any child maltreatment,and the experience of multi-type maltreatment, separately foreach groups: heterosexual/straight, all other sexuality identitycategories combined (‘sexuality diverse’), and those whorefused or didn’t know. As shown in Table 6, the prevalence ofchild maltreatment experienced by sexuality diverse Austra-lians was significantly higher compared to heterosexuals foreach type of child maltreatment, but particularly so for sexualabuse (51.9% cf. 20.1%). Overall, the trends for any type ofchild maltreatment followed a similar pattern, with lowerprevalence for heterosexuals (61.0%), compared to diversesexuality identities (83.9%). Significant differences werefound across each age group (where we had sufficient samplesize to estimate).Again, a much stronger pattern between diverse sexualitiesand child maltreatment was evident when individuals expe-rienced multi-type maltreatment. Sexuality diverse individualswere significantly less likely to experience no maltreatment,and sigificantly more likely to experience multi-type mal-treatment (2+ or 3+ types) than heterosexuals. As shown inTable 7, the proportion of people with diverse sexualitiesexperiencing three or more types (46.8%) was significantlyhigher – more than double the rate for heterosexuals (21.5%).This pattern of significantly higher multi-type maltreatmentexpeirenced by sexuality diverse individuals was fairly con-sistent across the youth cohort, the 25–44, and 45 years andHiggins et al. 9Table3.PrevalenceofSexualandGenderIdentitiesinAustralians16YearsandOlder,bySexualIdentitybyGenderIdentityandAgeGroup.16–24Years25–44Years45̂YearsorMoreTotalnWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CInWeighted%95%CIHeterosexualorstraightMen155289.6(88.0–91.1)90290.9(89.0–92.9)137695.1(93.8–96.3)383092.8(91.8–93.8)Women126376.2(73.9–78.5)85987.0(84.7–89.3)144894.1(92.7–95.5)357089.4(88.2–90.5)Diversegenders53.7(.4–7.0)631.3(8.8–53.8)970.7(45.1–96.2)2032.7(19.5–45.9)GayorlesbianMen562.6(1.8–3.3)433.8(2.6–5.1)291.8(1.0–2.5)1282.6(2.0–3.2)Women321.8(1.2–2.5)161.8(.9–2.7)201.1(.5–1.6)681.4(1.0–1.9)Diversegenders1013.2(4.4–22.1)1a0a116.8(1.2–12.3)BisexualMen834.6(3.5–5.6)262.8(1.6–3.9)171.0(.5–1.6)1262.2(1.6–2.7)Women24814.9(13.0–16.8)565.5(4.0–7.1)150.9(.4–1.4)3194.3(3.6–4.9)Diversegenders2224.5(14.7–34.3)4a1a2714.7(7.6–21.7)QueerMen50.2(.0–.4)0a0a50.0(.0–.1)Women130.7(.3–1.2)90.7(.2–1.2)1a230.4(.2–.6)Diversegenders1212.8(5.4–20.2)4a0a1611.6(4.2–19.1)AsexualMen110.6(.2–.9)3a4a180.4(.1–.6)Women150.8(.4–1.2)3a4a220.3(.1–.5)Diversegenders1415.1(7.4–22.8)0a0a145.0(2.1–7.9)PansexualMen140.7(.3–1.2)3a1a180.2(.1–.4)Women402.3(1.6–3.1)131.3.6–2.1)4a570.8(.5–1.1)Diversegenders1820.8(11.5–30.2)4a0a2214.6(6.1–23.1)IprefernottohavealabelMen90.7(.2–1.1)3a80.4(.1–.6)200.4(.2–.6)Women261.6(.9–2.3)90.9(.3–1.6)100.7(.2–1.1)450.9(.5–1.2)Diversegenders1a0a0a1(a)OtherMen3a1a1a50.2(.0–.4)Women60.4(.0–.7)0a3a90.2(.0–.3)Diversegenders3a2a0a54.3(.0–9.0)Don’tknow/refusedMen150.9(.4–1.5)111.3(.5–2.2)191.3(.7–1.9)451.2(.8–1.7)Women191.3(.6–1.9)212.3(1.3–3.4)292.6(1.6–3.7)692.4(1.7–3.0)Diversegenders55.7(.4–10.9)1a4a1010.0(2.2–17.7)a Notpublishedasfewerthanfivesampleparticipants.10 Child Maltreatment 0(0)Table4.PrevalenceofChildMaltreatment,byAgeGroup,GenderIdentityandTypeofMaltreatment.EmotionalAbuseNeglectPhysicalAbuseSexualAbuseExposuretoDomesticViolenceAnychildMaltreatment%95%CI%95%CI%95%CI%95%CI%95%CI%95%CI16–24yearsMen26.9(24.6–29.3)7.2(5.8–8.5)26.3(24.0–28.5)14.5(12.6–16.5)40.8(38.2–43.3)55.5(52.9–58.0)Women40.5(37.9–43.1)12.5(10.8–14.2)29.0(26.6–31.4)35.2(32.7–37.8)45.8(43.2–48.5)65.5(63.0–68.1)Diversegenders71.5(61.3–81.7)30.6(19.9–41.2)53.8(42.5–65.0)62.8(51.8–73.8)64.8(54.0–75.5)90.5(84.0–97.0)25–44yearsMen27.0(23.9–30.1)7.0(5.3–8.8)33.4(30.2–36.7)18.5(15.8–21.2)44.3(40.9–47.8)62.5(59.1–65.8)Women40.3(37.0–43.7)13.7(11.2–16.2)35.6(32.3–38.9)38.8(35.4–42.2)47.4(44.0–50.8)70.4(67.2–73.5)Diversegenders70.3(48.6–92.0)28.6(7.3–49.9)50.8(27.9–73.7)47.4(24.6–70.2)65.6(43.1–88.2)81.8(61.2–100.0)45yearsormoreMen23.8(21.4–26.2)6.3(4.8–7.7)32.8(30.1–35.5)20.2(17.9–22.4)32.6(30.0–35.3)56.2(53.3–59.0)Women31.4(28.8–34.0)8.4(6.8–10.0)29.5(27.0–32.1)36.9(34.2–39.6)35.2(32.6–37.9)62.4(59.7–65.2)Diversegendersaa43.7(14.6–72.7)45.2(16.2–74.1)39.0(11.3–66.7)70.0(44.0–96.1)TotalMen25.4(23.7–27.1)6.7(5.7–7.6)32.1(30.3–33.9)18.8(17.3–20.3)38.0(36.1–39.9)58.4(56.5–60.3)Women35.6(33.8–37.4)10.8(9.5–12.0)31.5(29.7–33.3)37.3(35.5–39.2)40.8(38.9–42.6)65.5(63.7–67.4)Diversegenders58.3(45.6–71.1)26.4(15.5–37.4)49.9(37.3–62.5)51.9(39.3–64.6)58.2(45.5–70.9)81.5(70.4–92.6)a Notpublishedasfewerthanfivesampleparticipants.BoldsignifiessignificantlydifferentthanMenorWomenp<.05.Higgins et al. 11over age groups (see Table 7). As we found with genderdiversity, a similarly striking pattern is that there appears to beno significant age-group differences in the comparative ORsof each and any child maltreatment by diverse sexualityidentities.As recommended by the SAGER guidelines, we thenexplored whether there weas any relationship between socio-economic status (using the SEIFA index) and gender andsexuality diversity. We found no significant differences inprevalence of diverse gender (Figure 1) or sexuality (Figure 2)identities by quintiles of the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage. We also calculatedORs for experience of child maltreatment relative to men (fordiverse gender identities), or to heterosexuals (for diversesexuality identities). Using logistic regression models ad-justing for age group and SEIFA, we concluded that all of theORs for increased risk of child maltreatment remained sig-nificantly elevated for people with diverse genders (seeTable 8) or diverse sexualities (see Table 9). While fitting thelogistic regression models, we tested for interactions betweengender diversity and SEIFA and between sexuality diversityand SEIFA and noted no significant interaction effects for anytype of child maltreatment, suggesting that the relationshipbetween gender diversity, sexuality diversity and child mal-treatment was independent of socio-economic status.DiscussionThis paper presents the most comprehensive nationally rep-resentative prevalence of diversity in adult Australians (interms of both gender and sexuality identities) and theassociations with childhood experiences of five separate formsof maltreatment and their intersection: multi-type maltreat-ment. As recommended by Heidari et al. (2016), we conductedboth sexuality and gender sensitive analyses, and consideredthe relevance of child maltreatment prevalence research fordiverse populations.We found the prevalence of people with diverse genders is.9% in the Australian population. Our methods (random digitdial; sampling adults across the lifespan) may explain why thisprevalence is considerably lower than recent US studies ofyouth recruited via social media, which found up to 13.9% ofparticipants had gender diversity (Mitchell et al., 2023; Ybarraet al., 2022). Our population-representative data showed thatdiversity varied across the age cohorts. The much greaterproportion of our youth cohort identifying with a diversegender identity (2.3%) is likely to reflect the greater socialawareness and acceptability of gender not being a binary ofmale/female.For the first time, we also have population-representativedata showing that it is common for people in Australia to havediverse sexuality identities (9.5%). There are important dif-ferences based on the age and gender.

We observeddouble the rate of participants with sexually diverseidentities (7.6%) than Wilson et al.’s (2020) estimates forAustralia of 3.6% for men and 3.4% for women. We alsofound a much higher proportion of younger people re-porting a diverse sexuality identity than older participants,as did Wilson et al. We also noted this same pattern fordiverse genders. Like Wilson et al., we reported that genderand sexuality intersect – for example, with women morelikely to identify as bisexual than men. Extrapolating oursample data to the Australian population means that around200,000 Australians identify with diverse genders, andaround 1.6 million with diverse sexualities. This needs to bea major focus of prevention and response initiatives, givenour findings of the significantly increased risk of multi-typechild maltreatment. These numbers are likely to keep in-creasing, given the stark differences we identified betweenthe youth sample and the older age cohorts.Diversity and Exposure to HarmOur data, from adults aross the lifespan, align with Mitchellet al.’s 2023 study of 14–15 years olds showing that the mostcommon experience of sexuality and gender diverse youths isto have childhoods characterised by multiple adversities. Wealso found significantly higher exposure to multi-type (andsevere multi-type) maltreatment. The strong association be-tween multi-type child maltreatment and both gender andsexuality diversity may help explain some of the unique healthdisparities and the burden of disease in terms of mental healththat has been found for gender and sexually diverse people(Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Lesbian, Gay,Bisexual, and Transgender Health Issues and ResearchGaps and Opportunities, 2011). A unique finding from ourstudy is that the associations were strong not just for expe-riencing a single type, but also for experiencing multi-typemaltreatment. Given the evidence on the strong relationshipbetween experiences of multi-type maltreatment and thephysical and mental disorders, health-risk behaviors andhealth service utilization (Lawrence et al., 2023; Pacella et al.,2023; Scott et al., 2023), it is likely that the higher rates ofmental and physical health problems in those who identifywith diverse sexualities and genders may be explained in partby the high prevalence of multi-type maltreatment in these twogroups.Similar to North American research (e.g., Grocott et al.,2023; Tobin & Delaney, 2019), child maltreatment wasstrongly associated with gender diversity in the ACMS– particularly for the youth cohort. Other research fromAustralia has shown that young people with non-binary (di-verse gender) identities are more likely to have lower per-ceptions of safety in institutions (Russell et al., 2020). TheACMS results may provide an explanation for Russell et al.’sfinding that gender diverse young people feel less safe ininstitutions, due to the significantly greater likelihood of theirexposure to one of the most damaging experiences of childmaltreatment: multi-type maltreatment. As noted by Hambyet al. (2021), there is greater recognition now of the problem ofnarrowing in and focusing on one type of trauma withouttaking into account the likelihood of experiencing multipleadversities. Researchers and practitioners need to avoid silos,and accept that multiple advertisities are the ‘norm’ for thosewho experience child maltreatment, but evenmore so for thosewho are gender and/or sexuality diverse. Importantly, thegreater burden of trauma for gender and sexuality diverseinidivduals, and the often-cited likelihood of greater mentalhealth problems in these populations, is likely attributable tothe cumulative effects of multiple adversities they have ex-perienced in childhood (e.g., Randell & Scanlan, 2019).Although diversity in gender and sexuality were bothstrongly associated with child maltreatment experiences, themechanisms and causal relationships are unclear. A child oryoung person who presents outside of the ‘norms’ of gender orsexuality expression may make them a target for victimisationby parents, carers, other family members, peers or staff ineducational and youth-serving organisations with which theyengage. In relation to child sexual abuse, it may be that thoseperpetrating sexual abuse select victims based on vulnerability(such as being part of a sexuality and/or gender diverseidentity group), due to their greater risk of social isolation, andtheir need for love and acceptance (and therefore susceptibilityto grooming). It is unclear whether such patterns of vulner-ability may also apply to those experiencing other forms ofchild maltreatment, or exposure to multi-type maltreatment.Children or young people who express themselves in waysthat do not align with gender norms and behaviors from anearly age may therefore be at risk of maltreatment fromparents, carers, other adults, or victimisation from siblingsor other children and young people (including sexualvictimsation).In a rare prospective longitudinal study, Xu et al. (2020)found that maternal reports of childhood paternal physical oremotional maltreatment prior to age 7 were associated withself-reported same-sex sexual orientation at age 15 for boys(but not statistically significant for girls). However, they didnot explore the relationship for other forms of child mal-treatment, including sexual abuse. Without comprehensiveprospective data it is difficult to fully understand temporalsequencing let alone causality. Moreover, the stigma, shame,silence, and difficulty with speaking up can apply both to16 Child Maltreatment 0(0)victimisation from child maltreatment and to coming out witha diverse gender or sexuality identity. Speaking up or comingout are both likely to have significant time lags betweenbehaviors or events and even the earliest of internal aware-ness, and cognitive framing of them. Parental rejection, at-tempts to impose conventional behavior, sibling abuse, peerabuse or other victimisation may result from a child or youngperson’s (presumed or disclosed) diverse identity.Our findings highlight the rapid increase in recent years ofgender and sexuality diversity in the population in Australia,with current rates likely to be much higher than previouslyestimated. The significantly higher likelihood of gender andsexuality diverse Australians having experienced childmaltreatment—particularly multi-type maltreatment—hasimportant implications for policies and services. A greaterclimate of acceptance and recognition of diversity is needed tounderpin general child maltreatment prevention and responsestrategies. Our estimates of the prevalence of gender andsexuality diversity, together with the significantly greater oddsnot only of any form of child maltreatment but of its mostdamaging form – when multiple types are experienced –should make this group a high priority for service providersdelivering therapeutic interventions, redress schemes or otherjustice responses and supports for victim/survivors. Diversitygroups must also be a priority focus in prevention initiatives,from child-sexual abuse safeguarding strategies in organisa-tions, through to parenting advice and programs to supportparents of children with emerging diverse identities.Approaches to Prevention. Strategies to prevent or reduce risksof each form of child maltreatment need to take into accountgender and sexuality diversities. It may be that existing ap-proaches do not work as well for ensuring the safety ofsexuality and/or gender diverse youths, or that additionalattention and unique strategies might be needed. For example,in attempts to improve the quality of parenting for familieswith gender and/or sexuality diverse children and youths, thisshould include both guidance and supports for parents (par-enting skills, and specific safeguarding advice and skillsbuilding) that are tailored to their unique circumstances.Similarly, in terms of addressing situational risks of childsexual abuse, organisational safeguarding strategies mightneed to be amplified and adjusted to take into account thegreater vulnerability of sexuality and gender diverse youngpeople, such as strategies to address transport, sleeping ar-rangements, or access to appropriate bathroom facilities whileon camps, excursions or other outings.Approaches to Treatment and Responses to ChildMaltreatment. Clinicians must acknowledge not only the di-versity of gender and sexuality identities we found in Aus-tralia, but the increased likelihood that those with diverseidentities have experienced child maltreatment, particularlymulti-type maltreatment. They should take into accountgender and sexuality diversities in their interventions, in termsof considering whether the evidence of the effectiveness oftheir treatment might vary for adults who are heterosexualversus sexuality diverse, and might vary for men, women, andgender diverse individuals. Most importantly, they should payattention to the significantly higher likelood that adults whoidentify as a sexuality or gender minority will have experi-enced multiple forms of child maltreatment, and make suretheir identification and assessment of childhood trauma iscomprehensive and attuned to this. Clinicians should alsoconsider ways of addressing discrimination, stigma or fearbased on gender and sexuality identities, which may be criticalfor the safety and wellbeing of their clients.Comparison across the age cohorts in the ACMS alsoshows a substantial growth over time in the proportion of thepopulation with a diverse identity. Service providers need toacknowledge and plan for the increased likelihood whendealing with younger clients, and their parents, carer andfamily. There are existing resources that are useful in guidingpractitioners in how to be gender- and sexuality-sensitive (e.g.,Australian Institute of Families Studies, 2022). However,additional support and training as part of pre-service educationprograms for key professional groups (like teachers, nurses,doctors, and other allied health professionals) is needed.Strengths and LimitationsThis first analysis of child maltreatment and epidemiologicaldata on diverse identities in Australia has considerablestrengths. It is a random sample, representative of the nationalpopulation, and it uses a well-validated, behaviorally specificmeasure that assessed the latest conceptual models of childmaltreatment and open-ended questions that allowed partic-ipants to self-identify their gender and sexuality.However, interviewers did not explicitly ask about sexassigned at birth – only about current self-identified gender. Itis possible that some people who identified as men or womenmay have been assigned a different sex at birth. These peoplewere classified based on their reported gender. Therefore, wecannot be sure that the data for men and women are entirelyabout people who are cisgendered. This may have led to veryslight underestimates of transgender people, particularly ifthey gave their gender as simply “male” or “female”. Futurestudies should include sex at birth as well as current genderidentity.Our analysis uses cross-sectional and retrospective data,which precludes determination of causality. With such starkdifferences in the prevalence of maltreatment between thosewith and without diverse genders and sexualities, researchersmay wonder if these variables are causally related. Furtherresearch is needed to explore, for example, whether thosechildren/adolescents with early indications of gender orsexuality diversity make them more vulnerable to abuse andneglect, or—conversely—does experiencing childhood abuseand/or neglect—or subsequent discrimination and victim-isation in adulthood—make people more likely to identify inHiggins et al. 17diverse ways either during childhood/adolescence or adult-hood, or the role of family rejection of children with emergingdiverse entities, or their rejection of unaccepting and rejectingfamily.Finally, our analyses did not look at diversity in terms ofwho perpetrated the maltreatment (men vs. women; parent vs.other; and—for sexual abuse—whether it was an adult vs. apeer), or the context (institutional, familial, other). Furtheranalyses are required that look at the contribution that childmaltreatment makes to any relationship between diversesexualities and/or gender identities and health outcomesacross the lifespan (health, health-risk behaviors, and mentalhealth) – and potential mechanisms that help explain any suchrelationships (including temporal sequencing, causal rela-tionships, and other variables that might play a mediating ormoderating roles).ConclusionFor the first time in Australia, we have comprehensive,nationally representative data on the prevalence of diversityin both gender and sexuality identities, and strong empiricalevidence on the strong association for both with experiencesof five separate forms of child maltreatment and multi-typemaltreatment. Child maltreatment primary preventionstrategies, targeted interventions and therapeutic responsesfor children, youth and adult survivors (including justiceresponses) must recognise this sexuality and gender diver-sity, and the needs of these important—and growing—subgroups.Data Availability StatementUnder a registered data management plan, final data sets willbe stored on the Australian Data Archive, with details foraccess from 2025 made available on the ACMS Web site.Under a multi-institutional agreement, the survey instrumentis the intellectual property of the research team.

Two of the identity categories, defined by the UN, including“gender-diverse” which refers to those whose gender identity “is atodds with what is perceived as being the gender norm in a particularcontext at a particular point in time, including those who do notplace themselves in themale/female binary”. TheUN also notes that“trans” is a more specific term describing those who identify with adifferent sex than the one assigned to them at birth. See: https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/ie-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity/struggle-trans-and-gender-diverse-persons. There isalso a range of other identities that fall outside of the binary ofmale/female, including: trans femme, transmasculine, gender queer,non-binary, sister girl, brother boy, agender, and those who prefernot to have a label (ABS, 2021).2. Eight individuals stated they didn’t know, and nine refused to statetheir gender. Of the eight who didn’t know, six experienced childmaltreatment. Of the nine who refused, five experienced childmaltreatment. Therefore we decided to include both those whorefused, and those who said they didn’t know in the ‘diversegenders’ category, as we wanted our measure of gender diversityto include all participants who were not comfortable identifyingwith the gender binary of male or female. We repeated our an-alyses of prevalence of child maltreatment with and without bothgroups, and there were only minor differences in prevalence ratesof child maltreatment.3. https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1800.018 Child Maltreatment 0(0)ReferencesACON.

    "abstract": "This study presents the most comprehensive national prevalence estimates of diverse gender and sexuality identities in Australians, and the associations with five separate types of child maltreatment and their overlap (multi-type maltreatment). Using Australian Child Maltreatment Study (ACMS) data (N = 8503), 9.5% of participants identified with a diverse sexuality and.9% with a diverse gender. Diverse identities were more prevalent in the youth cohort, with 17.7% of 16–24 years olds identifying with a diverse sexuality and 2.3% with a diverse gender. Gender and sexuality diversity also intersect – for example, with women (aged 16–24 and 25–44) more likely than men to identify as bisexual. The prevalence of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and exposure to domestic violence was very high for those with diverse sexuality and/or gender identities. Maltreatment was most prevalent for participants in the youth cohort with diverse gender identities (90.5% experiencing some form of child maltreatment; 77% multi-type maltreatment) or diverse sexualities (85.3% reporting any child maltreatment; 64.3% multi-type maltreatment). The strong association found between child maltreatment and diverse sexuality and gender identities is critical for understanding the social and mental health vulnerabilities of these groups, and informing services needed to support them.</p",
