Carrotte1*, Alyce M. Vella1, Anna L. Bowring1,2, Caitlin Douglass1,2, Margaret E. Hellard1,2\nand Megan S. C. Lim1,2,3\nAbstract\nBackground: Heteronormativity describes a set of norms and assumptions pertaining to heterosexual identities\nand binary gender. In 2015, we conducted our annual Sex, Drugs and Rock’n’Roll study, an online health survey\nof over 1000 Victorians aged 15–29 years. Feedback from participants suggested that our survey contained\nheteronormative language. In response to this, we aimed to make inclusive changes to our survey via consultation\nwith young gender and sexually diverse (GSD) people.\nMethods: We conducted two semi-structured focus groups in Melbourne with a total of 16 participants (age\nrange: 21–28 years). Participants were mostly cisgender women, and there were two transgender participants\nand one non-binary participant. Participants also had a range of sexual identities including lesbian, queer,\nbisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Focus group discussions were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.\nResults: Most participants indicated heteronormativity affects their lives in multiple ways, noting its impacts on\naccess to sexual healthcare, invalidating sexual experiences and miscommunication in forms and surveys. Overall,\nparticipants emphasised the need for sexual health research to avoid assumptions about behaviour, to be clear\nand eliminate question ambiguity and avoiding treating gender as binary. Participants also discussed how the\nSex, Drugs and Rock’n’Roll survey could address a range of sexual behaviours and experiences, rather than\nfocusing on penetrative sex, which many participants found invalidating.\nConclusions: Our findings have important implications for future health surveys aimed at general populations.\nWe present recommendations that encourage research to be more inclusive to ensure data collection from GSD\nparticipants is respectful and rigorous.\nBackground\nGender and sexual diversity is an umbrella term relating\nto gender expressions not matching male and female\ngender norms (including transgender and non-binary\nidentities), sexual identities, attractions and behaviours\nother than heterosexual, and intersex variations where\nreproductive or sexual anatomy do not fit typical male\nor female classifications. Although these identities are\nincreasingly being recognised and celebrated, many gen-\nder and sexually diverse (GSD) individuals experience\nthe effects of heteronormativity [1]. Heteronormativity\ndescribes a set of societal assumptions and norms which\nare based on heterosexual, cisgender1 experiences, influ-\nenced by social biases, privilege and stereotyping [1–3].\nHeteronormativity can have negative impacts on the\npsychological well-being of GSD people, contributing\nto feelings of invisibility, invalidation and marginal-\nisation [1].\nExamples of heteronormativity can be found in mul-\ntiple settings. School-based sexual education is largely\nheteronormative, often lacking representation and dis-\ncussion of GSD people and their experiences [2, 4].\nQualitative research suggests that heteronormativity in\nsexual education legitimises homophobic bullying and\ncontributes to the marginalisation of GSD people [4].\nGSD people may also experience heteronormativity in\n* Correspondence: elise.carrotte@burnet.edu.au\n1Centre for Population Health, Burnet Institute, 85 Commercial Road,\nMelbourne, VIC 3004, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2016 The Author(s).

Some physicians make assumptions about\ntheir patients’ gender, sexual identity and behaviour due\nto their lack of awareness or hesitancy to approach\nsensitive topics. However, GSD people have unique\nhealth needs, influenced by both sexual orientation and\nbehaviour [5, 6]. For example, physicians may inaccur-\nately assume their GSD patients are not at risk of\nsexually transmissible infections (STIs) if they do not\nreport penetrative sexual intercourse [7–12], even\nthough lesbians and bisexual women are more likely\nthan heterosexual women to have ever been diagnosed\nwith an STI [13]. Inadequate healthcare access can ad-\nversely impact the sexual health and mental wellbeing of\npatients and negative experiences may contribute to-\nwards low continuity of care and satisfaction with health\nproviders [8, 14–16].\nConsidering unique sexual health needs and barriers\nto appropriate healthcare access, there is a need to con-\nduct research into the sexual health of GSD people to\ninform policy and practice. While studies specifically tar-\ngeting GSD individuals exist, (e.g. [17, 18]) general\npopulation studies should also include these communi-\nties in order to accurately reflect the prevalence and be-\nhaviours of GSD individuals and allow methodologically\nsound comparisons between groups [19]. However, it is\ncommon for researchers to make heteronormative as-\nsumptions about their participants’ gender identities and\nsexual orientation based on limited responses – for ex-\nample, making assumptions about sexual identity based\non behaviour or vice versa [20]. It is also common for\nresearchers to conflate sex assigned at birth, gender\nidentity and genitals, leading to the miscategorisation or\nexclusion of participants with intersex variations, trans-\ngender participants and participants with non-binary\nidentities [20]. Further, sexual health research commonly\nrelies on categorisation of sexual behaviours that focus\non penetration and assume the presence of a penis [20].\nThese problems are also common in other forms of writ-\nten communication, such as healthcare intake forms,\nwhere GSD patients often struggle to accurately commu-\nnicate their gender and sexual information with limited\nresponse categories, causing frustration and miscommu-\nnication [21]. Sexual health surveys should be designed\nto minimise heteronormativity and allow all participants\nto accurately and respectfully answer questions.\nAlthough there are no universally accepted best\npractice recommendations, several organisations and\nresearchers have made recommendations for inclusive\nresearch methodology. Researchers Ansara and Hegarty\n[22] provide recommendations regarding gender diver-\nsity in the context of psychological research, recom-\nmending use of blank text boxes for recording\nparticipants’ gender and only asking for sex if relevant to\nresearch, and – if necessary to use categories – to in-\nclude multiple, itemised gender options and the ability\nto select multiple options [22]. Meanwhile, the Gender\nIdentity in U.S. Surveillance group (GenIUSS; a collabor-\nation between researchers and GSD groups) and the San\nFrancisco Department of Public Health provide recom-\nmendations for population-based surveys; both recom-\nmend a two-step approach (i.e., asking about sex\nassigned at birth and also gender identity). This ap-\nproach has high sensitivity and specificity with adult\npopulations; however, there is no clear evidence that this\napproach is appropriate for surveys including adoles-\ncents [23, 24]. OII (Organisation Intersex International)\nAustralia recommends intersex status be asked as a sep-\narate question; people with intersex variations do not\nnecessarily identify with the term ‘intersex’ in relation to\ngender and/or sex [25]. Regarding sexual orientation, the\nSexual Minority Assessment Research Team (SMART)\npublished recommendations for general research, and\nrecommend asking about the three major dimensions of\nsexual orientation (identity, behaviour and attraction)\nseparately if relevant to the research [26]; to contrast,\nthe LGBTI Alliance recommends asking about attraction\nor behaviour rather than identity for young people who\nmay still be forming identities [19]. However, no known\ninclusive language recommendations exist that are spe-\ncific to youth sexual health research, and no known pa-\npers report details of consultations with young GSD\npeople on these issues. Therefore, these recommenda-\ntions were not directly applicable to our research.\nIn this study, we aimed to fill this gap in the context\nof the Sex, Drugs and Rock’n’Roll (SDRR) survey, an an-\nnual survey of Australians aged 15–29 years conducted\nby the Burnet Institute since 2005 [27]. From 2005 to\n2014, this general and sexual health survey was con-\nducted at a music festival, where participants self-\ncompleted a brief, paper-based questionnaire. The sur-\nvey defined sex as ‘sexual intercourse’ or ‘penis in vagina\nor penis in anus’ before questions on sexual behaviour, a\ndefinition similar to that used in other sexual health re-\nsearch aimed at general populations. In 2015, the survey\nwas conducted online. Researchers received several\nnegative comments about the language of our survey,\nwith comments about heteronormative language relating\nto sexual health and sexual risk behaviour questions,\nsuggesting we failed to develop rapport with some par-\nticipants. It is likely that participants felt more comfort-\nable communicating these issues online rather than face-\nto-face. Further, many female participants in our survey\nreported sex in the past year with female partners des-\npite the survey’s definition of sex (involving a penis).\nMany of these women ticked an option indicating no\ncontraception was used the last time they had sex,\nresulting in data which incorrectly assumed their STI\nCarrotte et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:86 Page 2 of 10\nand pregnancy risks were comparable to unprotected,\nvaginal intercourse. Therefore, this study explored the\nperspectives of young GSD people on issues of hetero-\nnormativity, sexual health and experiences with research,\nwith the aim of improving and making more relevant\nthe language used in the SDRR survey and similar\nresearch.\nMethods\nRecruitment strategy\nRecruitment notices were posted on Burnet Institute’s\nwebsite and social media channels as well as the social\nmedia channels of a variety of organisations focusing on\ngender and sexual diversity. Recruitment notices were\nalso emailed to relevant university student organisations.\nInclusion criteria were being aged 18–29 years, with the\ninvitation requesting ‘young women who identify as gay,\nlesbian or bisexual (or otherwise report sexual interest\nin women), transgender people, and/or other young\nmembers of GLBTIQ+ communities.’ Further informa-\ntion was provided and consent forms distributed upon\nexpression of interest. Participation in the earlier SDRR\nsurvey was not required. Prior to the focus group, partic-\nipants reported their gender, sexual identity and pre-\nferred pronouns to be used when reporting results and\nwhen personally addressed within the focus groups. Par-\nticipants were reimbursed for their time.\nFocus group discussions\nTwo ninety-minute focus group discussions (FGDs) were\nheld in Melbourne. FGDs have previously been effective\nfor obtaining in-depth information with GSD people [1,\n28, 29]. Topics for FGDs were decided a priori; a discus-\nsion guide was developed by the researchers. This guide\nwas influenced by literature about heteronormativity and\nsexual health needs of GSD people, and the researchers’\nexperiences working with young people and minority\ngroups on sensitive topics such as sexuality.\nThe FGDs were facilitated by one member of the re-\nsearch team (EC) and two other members of the team\nassisted each group (CD, ML and AV). As informed by\nthe discussion guide, the FGDs began with open discus-\nsion about why the participants were interested in dis-\ncussing inclusive language in sexual health research. The\nfirst half of the FGDs was dedicated to semi-structured\ndiscussion on key topics including gender, sex and sexu-\nality, and assumptions others make about these topics\nand difficulties in written communication of these topics\nincluding surveys and healthcare forms. In the second\nhalf of the FGDs, participants were divided into groups\nof two to four and given printed copies of the SDRR sur-\nvey’s questions related to gender and sexual behaviour\n(Table 1). Participants annotated the questions and pro-\nvided both written and verbal suggestions for improving\nthe language of the survey. Interviews were recorded\nand transcribed verbatim. Identifying information was\nremoved prior to analysis, and all participants were\nassigned pseudonyms.\nAnalysis strategy\nQualitative thematic analysis was performed on both\ntranscribed data and written notes from participants.\nCoding was undertaken by one researcher (EC). After\ndata immersion, open coding was undertaken to apply\nheadings to concepts represented in the text. [30] Codes\nwere consolidated into higher-level themes concentrat-\ning on the impacts of heteronormativity; themes were\nrefined and organised through an iterative process based\non repetition of topics, relationships between codes and\nrelevance to the study aims. After the FGDs, the re-\nsearchers discussed and compared the groups’ suggestions\nto help inform decisions relating to survey changes. Deci-\nsions for survey changes were also informed by existing\nrecommendations from community based organisations\nand researchers (e.g. [22, 23, 26]).\nResults\nParticipants\nSixteen participants (age range 21–28 years, mean age =\n24.9 years) attended the FGDs. Seven participants\nattended the first FGD and nine attended the second.\nParticipants’ listed gender identities included cisgender\nwoman (n = 12), cisgender man (n = 1), transgender\nwoman (n = 1), transgender man (n = 1) and non-binary\n(n = 1). Participants sexual identities included lesbian\n(n = 6), queer (n = 2), bisexual (n = 2), pansexual/bisex-\nual (n = 1), pansexual/queer (n = 1), queer/gay (n = 1),\ngay (n = 1) and asexual (n = 1). One participant speci-\nfied she identified ‘with’ (not ‘as’) queer.\nThematic analysis\nThe first FGD focused on issues relating to transgender\npeople, lesbians and bisexual women. The second FGD\nalso focused on lesbians and bisexual women, but ex-\nplored further about asexuality and the influence of\npopular culture on assumptions and attitudes on GSD\npeople. Despite these minor differences, an overarching\ntheme of both FGDs was heteronormativity and its sig-\nnificant impacts on various aspects of participants’ lives.\nThe prevalence of heteronormativity (a major theme)\nand its impact on three areas of interest (sub-themes)\nare discussed briefly below, followed by a summary of\nsuggestions for improving the SDRR survey.\nHeteronormativity is everywhere\nParticipants identified examples of heteronormativity in\nmultiple settings, such as in healthcare, sexual education,\nthe workplace and even in brief interactions with\nCarrotte et al.

It was described as more frequent than homo-\nphobia. Most participants noted assumptions by others\n(typically heterosexual, cisgender individuals) about their\ngender and sexual identities, their relationships, their\nbodies and their sexual experiences. Experiencing and\nchallenging heteronormativity was described as exhaust-\ning, invalidating, frustrating and a ‘battle’. The impacts\nof heteronormativity in regards to three key concepts\nare described below.\nHeteronormativity is a barrier to sexual healthcare\nParticipants described heteronormativity as a barrier to-\nwards sexual health, specifically sexual health-seeking\nbehaviour. Most participants reported sexual health-\nrelated experiences and frustrations, including doctors\nignoring or struggling to acknowledge sexual identities\nand practices. Even when health professionals were\naware and accepting of participants’ gender and sexual\nidentities, stigmatising language or assumptions about\npatients’ sexual experiences (such as assuming that bi-\nsexual and pansexual participants led hypersexualised\nlifestyles) were common and acted as a barrier to devel-\noping rapport and receiving appropriate sexual health-\ncare. Some participants, particularly lesbian and bisexual\nwomen, described dismissive or ignorant attitudes of\ndoctors towards sexual experiences and STI risk behav-\niours if there is no risk of pregnancy. Transgender par-\nticipants acknowledged the difficulties of understanding\nand communicating their sexual health needs to doctors\nwho appeared uncomfortable or were unfamiliar with\ntransgender experiences and bodies.\nHeteronormativity invalidates sexual experiences\nParticipants described a heteronormative societal as-\nsumption that ‘sex’ is penis-in-vagina or penis-in-anus\nintercourse, and anything other than this is not ‘sex’.\nThis assumption was particularly distressing to partici-\npants who did not engage in penetrative intercourse\nregularly or at all.\nI just think having to justify stuff… it’s just very\nfrustrating… if it doesn’t tick these particular boxes,\nthese one or two boxes, then that’s not ‘sex’. Lisa, 22,\nlesbian, cisgender woman\nIt can make you feel like your sex doesn’t really\nmatter. Abby, 23, pansexual/bisexual, cisgender\nwoman\nMy experience, my relationships are valid. They’re\nvalid to me. Laura, 23, lesbian, cisgender woman\nParticipants described this assumption in many areas of\neveryday life. For example, female participants in relation-\nships with other women described being inappropriately\nquestioned about their sex lives by other people. Further,\nmost participants reported frustration and anger at\nschool-based sexual education, which they generally de-\nscribed as unhelpfully focusing on heterosexual vaginal\nintercourse and STI risk and failing to prepare them for\ntheir adult sex lives.\nWhen asked to define ‘sex’, participants struggled to\nidentify a specific definition. Participants indicated that\nsex is diverse, personal, usually intimate, and may not\nnecessarily be reflective of traditional views, even in het-\nerosexual encounters. Participants also discussed how\nexperiences of sex and sexuality evolve with age and in-\ndividual experiences, and focusing on penetrative sex\nfails to capture a spectrum of behaviours, thoughts, atti-\ntudes and experiences. While participants in both FGDs\nconcluded that it was unhelpful to have a specific definition\nof sex or define it on behalf of others, they also acknowl-\nedged that they wanted their individual understandings of\nwhat constitutes sex to be respected.\nHeteronormativity facilitates text-based\nmiscommunication\nIn most participants’ experiences, surveys and forms de-\nsigned for general populations rarely represent lifestyles\nof GSD people. Written communications, particularly\nthose that rely on selecting a single category, pose a\nchallenge for participants who do not necessarily fit into\nprovided categories.\nI am yet to encounter any survey on any topic at all\nthat actually reflects my life, and the activities that I\ndo with my life. Ivan, 28, gay, transgender man\nParticipants reported specific challenges with com-\npleting forms with regards to gender and sex – in-\ncluding having no options that describe them, not\nknowing how to ‘best’ respond to questions, and try-\ning to balance providing accurate information with in-\nformation that actually describes their experiences. It\nwas also noted that the common forced choice be-\ntween ‘male’ or ‘female’ can be upsetting for trans-\ngender and non-binary people.\nAfter being presented with the SDRR survey’s defin-\nition of sex, participants were asked whether they would\nanswer questions regarding sexual behaviour in align-\nment with their own ideas and definitions or with the\nsurvey’s definition. Most participants agreed they would\noften, if not always, answer with their own understand-\ning of sex in regards to sexual partners and risk behav-\niours. Participants noted that the inclusion of such a\ndefinition suggests that penetrative sex is the clinical\nand the only recognised definition of ‘sex’, indicating a\nlack of empathy. Some participants reported filling any\navailable free-text answer boxes with comments about\nCarrotte et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:86 Page 5 of 10\nheteronormative language in order to inform researchers\nof their predicament.\nI don’t go into a survey expecting that the options will\nmake me feel comfortable, or will be easy… when they\nask me about sexual behaviour, I will probably have\nto, like, sit there for fifteen minutes, thinking, “What\nanswer should I put down?” Taylor, 21, queer,\ntransgender woman\nParticipants unanimously reported strong negative\nfeelings towards the survey’s definition of sex, which re-\nsulted in the experience of ‘othering’ and feeling ex-\ncluded. These feelings can influence the participants’\nrelationship with the organisation that has developed the\nsurvey, making it difficult to develop rapport.\nWhen [my idea of sex] isn’t reflected in a survey, or\nnot legitimised, it also feels like that survey and\nwhoever’s funding that survey – and a lot of the time\nthat’s the government – doesn’t care about you, or\nyour health, or your wellbeing. Ivan, 28, gay,\ntransgender man\nRegardless of negative experiences with surveys, sev-\neral participants reported a willingness to participate in\nsexual health research, ideally if it were made more in-\nclusive and empathetic. Participants emphasised that\nthere is a lack of data about GSD communities, particu-\nlarly transgender and non-binary communities, and they\nwish to give data accurately and ‘respectfully,’ and have\nresearch be translated into positive change.\nI think it’s important just to raise it and say, “We’re\nhere. We’re here and we’re queer.” [laughter] “Take\nnotice and research us!” Anna, 26, lesbian, cisgender\nwoman\nSummary of suggestions for improving our survey\nParticipants readily agreed that the language of the\nSDRR survey (Table 1) could be improved, but acknowl-\nedged that this was not a straightforward task, particu-\nlarly as language evolves within GSD communities.\nParticipants emphasised the need to identify the true\naim of each question in order to help eliminate ambigu-\nity and clarify the desired response.\n“What are you actually asking of me?” I think is the\nthing. I mean, it’s really tough in research, because\nyou don’t wanna manufacture answers, but… when\nI’m filling out a survey like this that I know is\nimportant… I wanna know what it actually is that you\nwanna know from me. Do you wanna know if I’m at\nblood transmission risk? Do you wanna know if, you\nknow, I am engaging in a social culture? What part of\nmy experiences with this do you wanna know about?\nLeah, 23, identifies ‘with’ queer, cisgender woman.\nGender/sex\nParticipants questioned whether researchers were in-\nterested in the gender of the participants (a cultural\nconcept), or the participants’ sex assigned at birth\n(biological). It was noted that only being able to se-\nlect one option for gender was limiting, particularly\nas ‘transgender’ is an adjective and not a gender iden-\ntity. Participants suggested either replacing categories\nwith a free text box so survey participants could de-\nscribe their gender however they desired, or having\nmore diverse options. It was suggested to also have\n‘cisgender’ as an option (accompanied by a definition\nfor those unfamiliar with the term), to recognise non-\nbinary identities and intersex variations, and to spe-\ncify male-to-female and female-to-male transgender if\nusing categories. Another possibility included allowing\nselection of multiple options. Other questions in the\nsurvey were criticised for treating gender as a binary,\nparticularly for reporting sexual partners. Wherever\nterms like ‘boyfriend’ and ‘girlfriend’ were mentioned,\nit was suggested we include ‘partner’ either addition-\nally or as a replacement.\nSexual orientation\nIt was suggested that the question on sexual identity\n(Table 1) should use the word ‘currently’ as sexuality is\nfluid. Similar to the question on gender, participants sug-\ngested allowing selection of multiple options. It was\nnoted as unrealistic to list every possible sexual identity\nbut the most obvious omissions were asexual and pan-\nsexual; other suggested options included: ‘Never consid-\nered it’, ‘I don’t know’ and ‘I don’t label myself ’. Other\nsuggestions included randomising the order of the list\n(to eliminate a perceived hierarchy of sexual identities),\nmodifying future questions based on the participants’ se-\nlected sexual identity, and updating the list each year\nwith options listed in free-form text. Another suggestion\nwas including questions about attraction in place of, or\nin addition to, questions about identity.\nSexual behaviour\nThe main criticisms of sexual behaviour questions were\nheteronormative language and dismissiveness of sexual\nbehaviours other than penetrative sex. It was suggested\nthat the definition of sex could be removed (with sexual\nbehaviour of interest specified for each question), or\nmodified to be more inclusive. Participants suggested\nlessening the focus on penetrative sex and including\nCarrotte et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:86 Page 6 of 10\nsexual behaviours such as masturbation, pegging,2 and\nspecifying receptive vs. insertive anal sex.\nRegarding condom questions, participants suggested\nwe restructure to determine the reason why a participant\nmay select never using a condom, e.g., no chance of\npregnancy or low perceived STI transmission risk. Other\nsuggestions were including a broader definition of sexual\nbehaviour but listing more barrier methods of contra-\nception, or including a penetrative definition but en-\nsuring earlier questions are not dismissive of sexual\nbehaviours.\nChanges to the survey\nOur revised SDRR survey questions are summarised in\nTable 1; changes were based on the results of FGDs, dis-\ncussions within the research team, other surveys on\ntopics of gender, sex and sexual diversity (e.g. [17, 18])\nand recommendations from various sources (e.g. [22, 23,\n26]). These changes were made with consideration of\nthe key challenges of survey-based sexual health re-\nsearch, including identifying accurate measures of be-\nhaviour, minimising participation bias (including social\ndesirability) and comprehension problems, allowing par-\nticipants a safe space to accurately report behaviours\nthat may be of a sensitive nature, and treating sexuality\nwith nuance and respect [20, 31]. Although inclusivity\nregarding intersex status was briefly discussed in the\nFGDs, we did not have any participants who identified\nan intersex variation, and our decision to include\nintersex status as a separate question was informed by\nrecommendations from OII (Organisation Intersex\nInternational) Australia [25].\nDiscussion\nThis study reports on results of FGDs with young GSD\npeople regarding inclusive sexual health research meth-\nodology. Similar to research into healthcare needs of\nyoung GSD people [32], participants reported negative\nexperiences with heteronormativity, and an overwhelm-\ning desire to be treated with respect, competence and to\nhave their gender and sexual identities recognised in a\nvariety of formats. FGD participants confirmed prior\nfeedback that some of the language of the SDRR survey\nwas heteronormative, invalidating and could result in in-\naccurate data. Participants were passionate and eager to\nhave their concerns heard with regards to inclusive lan-\nguage, and expressions of interest outnumbered the allo-\ncated places in the FGDs. The main points raised in the\nFGDs included rethinking the survey structure to ensure\na range of sexual risk behaviours are captured accurately,\nto avoid treating gender as binary, and to ensure\nquestions asked in the survey are clear and inclusive. As\ndescribed in Table 1, our updated survey includes recog-\nnition of more gender and sexual identities, a significant\nrestructure of the sexual behaviour section (including\naddressing more sexual behaviours and related STI\ntransmission risks), and re-wording of several questions.\nInclusion and wording of questions is dependent on a\nparticular study’s research goals [33]. We believe our\nchanges are most appropriate at this time for the SDRR\nsurvey’s scope, location and audience – that is, sexual\nhealth research aimed at young, general populations.\nOur recommendations relating to gender are similar to\nthose suggested by Ansara and Hegarty [22] if using cat-\negorical response options. Our findings expand the exist-\ning literature by providing recommendations specific to\ninclusivity in sexual health research. Although previous\nresearch has discussed the impact of heteronormativity\namong GSD populations, (e.g. [1, 3]) this had not previ-\nously been discussed in the context of research. Our\nfindings also provide a detailed rationale on how hetero-\nnormative questionnaires can invalidate and frustrate\nGSD participants in the context of their lives, which are\nalready influenced by heteronormativity. These findings\nalso indicate that inclusive, respectful language and sur-\nvey structure can positively influence rapport.\nDespite our changes, our survey is still unlikely to fully\ncapture the complexities of identities and experiences of\nparticipants; we have maintained a largely category-\nbased multiple-choice structure to ease data collection\nfor our expected large samples (n > 1000). It was within\nthe scope of the research to focus on gender rather than\nsex assigned at birth; for other studies, particularly those\nfocusing on adult populations, the two-step process may\nbe most appropriate [23, 24]. We have focused on iden-\ntities, which may not capture experiences and attraction,\nlikely leading to underreporting of some experiences\n(e.g., some people with transgender life experiences do\nnot identify as ‘transgender’) [20, 23]. Of note, we have\nadded a significant number of questions to our survey,\nincreasing the risk of participant fatigue. Our survey is\naimed at a general population; it is likely that some ter-\nminology used in the survey may be confusing for some\nparticipants. We aim to address this limitation by word-\ning questions clearly [23]. We will review the content of\nthe survey over time from a range of perspectives, and\nmodify survey language if deemed necessary.\nRevisions to the survey introduce some additional lim-\nitations regarding coding and analysis. Importantly, as\nour questions have been modified, we will no longer be\nable to directly compare data for some variables across\nearlier surveys. Although we have included more cat-\negories for gender and sexual identities, it is likely that\nprevalence estimates of some communities in our sam-\nple will be small. Sample size may limit data analysis\nstrategies; for example, although we will ideally conduct\nanalyses among a diverse range of gender identities\nrather than excluding ‘outliers’ [22], any analyses\nCarrotte et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:86 Page 7 of 10\nperformed on these groups are likely to have relatively\nlarge margins of error and we may be unable to make\nmeaningful conclusions about behaviour [31]. Initially,\nwe may be required to collapse categories during data\nanalyses (although prevalence can still be reported in\ntext); this has occurred in prior research [17]. Depending\non response rates, we will need to consider using\nappropriate coding schemes which do not code gender\nidentities as mutually exclusive or treat sexual minorities\nas a homogenous group [20, 22]. It is possible that over\ntime, we can combine data to increase the sample size of\nminority groups and perform meaningful analyses [23,\n33]. Although not within the scope of our research,\nother sexual health surveys should consider over-\nsampling minority populations, such as specifically\nrecruiting from GSD events or organisations, or use of\nstrategies to maximise participation of minority groups,\ne.g., time-location sampling or respondent-driven sam-\npling [33]. When deciding on the best approach to inclu-\nsivity, future studies will need to consider balancing\nissues such as budget, space limitations, data accuracy,\ntarget population demographics, and coding strategies.\nConclusions\nBased on our results, and with consideration of other\nmethodology recommendations for general health re-\nsearch (e.g. [22, 23, 26]) and healthcare of GSD people\nin general [15, 34], we put forward recommendations for\ninclusive language in sexual health surveys involving\ngeneral populations of young people (Table 2). Some\nTable 2 Recommendations for inclusive sexual health research involving general populations\nTopic Recommendations\nGeneral Eliminate question ambiguity by identifying the true aim of each question and the type of data you wish to collect. To achieve this,\nensure questions are specific, clear and use defined time periods\nAvoid language that assumes participants are heterosexual or cisgender, or that certain behaviours are ‘normal’\nUse language that is culturally appropriate\nAvoid forced-choice, single option items and binary categorisations where possible\nAvoid skip patterns based on participants’ recorded gender or sexual identity; these require assumptions about participants’\nattraction, identity, behaviour and genitals\nRoutinely update questions based on cultural changes, feedback and relevant research while still considering data comparability across time\nConsult with GSD people and organisations if unsure of best wording of questions – avoid making assumptions\nCheck relevancy and appropriateness of questions, particularly if space or your budget is limited, and aim to balance these\nconsiderations with making language as inclusive as possible\nBe aware of your own biases and knowledge limitations as a researcher\nCarefully consider all recommendations within the context of the research (including location and audience)\nGender/sex Determine whether your research is interested in sex assigned at birth, gender identity, neither, or both\nIf interested in sex and gender, consider a two-step process, i.e., asking for sex and gender separately\nWhen asking for participants’ gender identities, use open-ended or free text options if possible. If free-text is not an option, ensure\noptions are more diverse than ‘female’ and ‘male’. Include recognition of transgender participants, non-binary/genderqueer partici-\npants, and other gender identities. Allow selection of multiple options or be specific with wording\nEnsure gender/sex questions are optional\nAvoid treating gender as binary (male/female) throughout the survey, including avoiding language implying a binary such as ‘both\ngenders’ or ‘opposite sex’\nAvoid conflating gender and sex and be consistent with terminology\nAsk about intersex variations separately from sex and gender\nSexual\norientation\nConsider sexual orientation in terms of identity, attraction and behaviour, if relevant\nWhen asking about sexual identity, use open-ended or free text options where possible. If free-text is not an option, avoid ‘othering’\nparticipants by including a range of sexual identities and options such as ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I don’t label myself’.\nConsider selection of multiple identities\nSexual\nbehaviour\nAvoid defining ‘sex’; instead, be specific to the sexual behaviour of interest\nClearly identify when questions are referring to STI transmission risk, risk of pregnancy, or other objectives\nConsider appropriate skip patterns for questions that may be irrelevant to participants based on previous response patterns (this\nwill also help reduce participant fatigue)\nConsider respectful and appropriate inclusion of sexual behaviours beyond penetrative sex\nCarrotte et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2016) 16:86 Page 8 of 10\nrecommendations, such as those related to gender and\nsexual orientation questions, are also relevant for more\ngeneral research.\nWe believe that with careful consideration of the\npoints raised in this project, investigators can make re-\nsearch significantly more inclusive, whilst maintaining\nrigour. It is unlikely that researchers will ever be able to\nbe inclusive of every individual participating in their re-\nsearch; however, routinely recognising diversity in future\nsexual health research has several benefits. These\nchanges have the potential to improve rapport with GSD\nparticipants. Further, these changes will allow for the\ncollection of more accurate data which may inform\nevidence-based healthcare and health interventions.\nEndnotes\n1Gender identity matches sex assigned at birth\n2A woman penetrating a man anally with a sex toy\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: 2015 Sex, Drugs and Rock'n'Roll survey.
