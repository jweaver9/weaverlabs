We conducted a large-scale field exper-iment building on the correspondence study methodology to examine interactions betweenproperty managers and fictitious couples engaged in searches in a major online rental hous-ing platform. We find evidence of discriminatory behavior against heterosexual coupleswhere the female partner is a transgender women (trans couples): they receive 19% fewerresponses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations to showings than hetero-sexual couples. However, we find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples. Wealso assess whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based discrimination or statisticaldiscrimination models by comparing response rates when couples signal a high socioeco-nomic status (high SES). While we find no significant effect of the signal on call-back ratesor the type of response for high-SES heterosexual or gay male couples, trans couples benefitwhen they signal a high SES. Their call-back, positive-response, and invitation rates increaseby 25%, 36% and 29%, respectively. These results suggest the presence of discriminationagainst trans couples in the Latin American online rental housing market, which seemsconsistent with statistical discrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexualcouples being favoured over gay male couples, nor evidence of statistical discrimination forgay male or heterosexual couples.JEL Classification: C93, J15, R23, R3Keywords: LGBTQ+, discrimination, correspondence study, rental housing market, LatinAmerica.∗This study is part of the project “LGBTQ+ Persons in Latin America and the Caribbean: MeasuringPopulation Sizes and Obstacles to Economic and Social Inclusion” and it was financed by the ResearchNetwork of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

Anecdotalevidence and survey data suggest that one of the areas where these groups continue toface strong discriminatory contraints in the region is the housing market.1 For instance,a large share of the population in Latin America respond that they would not like tohave homosexuals as neighbors when interviewed by the World Values Survey. Figure 1shows that the percentage varies from almost 10% in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, upto more than 30% in Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru.Figure 1: Percentage of individuals that would not like to have homosexual neighborsNotes: Data from the World Values Surveys between 2011 and 2020. Individuals were asked the followingquestion: \"On this list are various groups of people. Could you identify any that you would not like tohave as neighbors?\". The figure shows the percentage of respondents choosing the option \"homosexuals\".Assessing the extent of discrimination in the housing market is of particular interestnot only because discrimination can be inherently unjust, but also because housing andneighborhoods are key determinants of individuals’ opportunities (Chetty et al., 2016;Chetty and Hendren, 2018; Bergman et al., 2019; Chyn, 2018). Despite its relevance,causal evidence on discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the housing market is re-stricted to a few countries in Europe and North America—e.g., Sweden (Ahmed and Ham-1For example, newspapers report discrimination against transgender people in therental housing market in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during the COVID-19 pandemic(https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2021/09/03/le-negaron-el-alquiler-porque-su-novia-es-trans-no-se-hace-por-el-tema-de-tu-pareja/).2marstedt, 2008; Ahmed et al., 2008), Germany (Mazziotta et al., 2015), Serbia (Koehleret al., 2018), Ireland (Ahuja and Lyons, 2019), Portugal (Gouveia et al., 2020), Canada(Lauster and Easterbrook, 2011), and the U.S. (Friedman et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2017;Murchie and Pang, 2018; Schwegman, 2018; Hellyer, 2021).This paper aims to reduce this lack of knowledge by assessing the extent of discrim-ination against homosexual and transgender individuals in the rental housing marketsin four Latin American countries: Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. To thatend, we conducted a correspondence study (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Jowelland Prescott-Clarke, 1970; Riach and Rich, 1991) that allows us to examine interactionsbetween property managers—mostly real estate agents—and fictitious couples engaged inrental searches in a major online rental housing platform.In our experiment, fictitious couples send inquiries to property managers expressinginterest in renting an advertised property and requesting a visit. To identify discrim-inatory behavior based on the renter’s perceived gender identity or sexual orientation,we randomly vary the type of couple between heterosexual, gay male, and heterosexualcouple where the female partner is a trans woman. In addition, we explore whether dis-criminatory behavior is consistent with models of statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973;Phelps 1972) or taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957). To this end, we randomly varythe amount of information observed to property managers on the renter’s socioeconomicstatus (SES), from providing no information to signaling a high SES. Under a statisticaldiscrimination framework, property managers would rely on the type of couple to infertheir (unobserved) SES and vary their responses accordingly. If minorities are less likelyto have a high SES, then the gaps in response rates should decrease or disappear aftera high-SES signal is revealed. In this way, our experiment makes it possible not only tomeasure the extent of discrimination but also to study the underlying mechanisms.The experiment was carried out in April 2022 in the metropolitan areas of the twolargest cities of each country and targeted all property managers who had a property listedon the online platform. As a result, we contacted 3,624 property managers through theonline forms available on the platform. We estimate the causal effects of perceived genderidentity and sexual orientation on three outcomes—call-back rates, positive responsesand invitations to visit the property—based on linear probability models that exploit thevariation across property managers.We find strong discrimination against trans couples compared to gay male and het-erosexual couples. Specifically, when information about SES is not revealed (which werefer to as neutral SES), the call-back rates, positive-response rates and invitation ratesfor heterosexual and gay male couples are similar. However, trans couples receive 19%fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations relative to het-erosexual couples. Importantly, we find no statistically significant effect of disclosing thehigh-SES signal on any outcome for heterosexual or gay male couples. However we dofind large and positive effects of the high-SES signal for trans couples. Their responserate increases by 25%, the positive-response rate increases by 36% and the invitation rate3increases by 29%, closing the gap relative to heterosexual or gay male couples with highSES.Our results suggest the presence of discrimination against trans couples in the LatinAmerican online rental housing market, which—at least in part—is due to statisticaldiscrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favoured overgay male couples, nor evidence of discriminatory constraints consistent with statisticaldiscrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples.This paper contributes to the growing body of evidence on the economic effects ofLGBTQ+ discrimination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providingcausal evidence from a large-scale field experiment on discrimination based on gender iden-tity or sexual orientation in Latin American countries. While correspondence studies havebeen widely used in the last decades to measure gender- and race-based discrimination inthe labor and housing markets in the United States, Canada, and Europe (for instance,Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2008; Bosch et al., 2010;Hanson and Hawley, 2011; Machelett, 2018), only a few studies have used this approachto measure discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Evidence from the European andCanadian housing markets shows that gay male couples get less call-backs and invitationsto further contacts and to showings than heterosexual couples (Ahmed and Hammarstedt,2009; Ahmed and Hammarstedt, 2009; Ahuja and Lyons, 2019; Lauster and Easterbrook,2011). In the U.S. housing markets, results are somewhat mixed. While Friedman et al.(2013), Levy et al. (2017), and Schwegman (2018) find that gay male couples experienceless favorable treatment relative to heterosexual couples, Murchie and Pang (2018) findsthe opposite, i.e., that gay male couples receive the most favorable treatment. Our papercontributes to this literature by providing the first piece of evidence to assess discrimina-tion against gay couples in Latin American housing markets.Moreover, this paper joins the very few causal studies that measure discriminationagainst transgender people based on audit or correspondence studies. To the best ofour knowledge, no studies of this kind were conducted in developing countries. The onlyprecedents that we are aware of are Levy et al. (2017), Langowski et al. (2018) and Fritzson(2021) that analyze discrimination against transgender people in the United States’ andSweden’s housing markets, and Granberg et al. (2020) that studies discrimination againsttrans people in the Swedish labor market. For the case of the U.S. housing market,Levy et al. (2017) finds that housing providers offered transgender individuals fewer unitsthan cisgender ones. From 33 in-person paired tests, Langowski et al. (2018) finds thattransgender and gender non-conforming people received discriminatory treatment in theMetropolitan Boston rental housing market. Interestingly, based on a correspondencestudy contacting 800 landlords by email, Fritzson (2021) finds no significant discriminationagainst transgender individuals in Sweden but suggests that this may be due to theweakness of the transgender signal used in the experiment.2 There is also concern about2The author signals gender identity with a name change by including the individual’s former name inparentheses between the first and last name.4the external validity of the latter results since Sweden is one of the world’s most progressiveand LGBTQ+ friendly countries. Our study contributes to this literature by documentingfor the first time the prevalence of discriminatory constraints against transgender peoplein Latin American housing markets.Another contribution of our study is that it pioneers in providing evidence on themechanisms underlying discrimination against LGBTQ+ people, which is possible due tothe experiments’ large scale. Our experimental design includes randomized informationon the type of employment and collateral access to signal a couple with high SES. Thisinformation allows us to contrast different hypotheses about the type of discrimination.To the best of our knowledge, no other correspondence study assessing discrimination inthe housing market based on gender identity or sexual orientation evaluates statisticalversus taste-based discrimination. Murchie and Pang (2018) is the only exception. Theirexperimental design provides an indirect signal of SES: an email written formally andwithout grammatical errors is taken as a signal for high SES, whereas an email withgrammar mistakes and casually worded is used to proxy low SES.Finally, our results contribute to a better understanding of the type of barriers thatLGBTQ+ people face in accessing housing services in the region to help design moreinclusive programs and policies.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of theexperimental design, implementation, and data collection. Section 3 describes the dataand assesses the validity of the design. Section 4 presents and discusses the main resultswhile Section 5 explores heterogeneities. Section 6 concludes.2 Experimental designWe implemented a large-scale correspondence study in the online rental housing marketin Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to test whether there exists discriminationagainst LGBTQ+ people. We also test how discrimination varies with additional infor-mation about the prospective renter.3One of the main advantages of the correspondence study methodology is that it di-rectly measures discrimination in specific markets and overcomes the lack of representativeand unbiased data, which is prevalent in LGBTQ+ populations (Badgett et al., 2021).Correspondence studies also ensure more robust comparability across treatment groupsthan in prior studies—e.g., audit studies—guaranteeing that any observed differences arecaused solely by the trait variation. Another advantage of the correspondence study ap-proach is its low marginal cost, which allows for a larger sample size and scale. In our case,we can reach the four countries in Latin America that use the same online rental housingplatform. Such a large sample not only provides more precise estimates but also allows us3The experiment was registered on the AEA RCT Registry as trial AEARCTR-0009012, and thehuman subjects protocol for this research design was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)from Universidad del Rosario. IRB Approval Date: 01/19/2022. IRB Approval Number: CEI-UR 572-CS364.5to measure discrimination from more angles and, therefore, to test specific discriminationtheories (Bertrand and Duflo, 2017).In our experiment, fictitious couples send inquiries in response to online rental adver-tisements using customized scripts. In the scripts, we randomize the sexual orientationof couples or the gender identity of one of the partners while perfectly controlling allinformation about prospective renters observed by each property manager. We randomlyvary the type of couple among the following three options: heterosexual, gay male, orheterosexual couple where the female partner is a transgender woman, which we referto as a trans couple for simplicity. We also vary the information on the couple’s SES,from not signaling SES to providing positive information—we inform that both partnersare professionals with stable jobs and have rental collateral. This second variation helpsdistinguish the type of discrimination. Discrimination is mainly estimated by comparingthe response rates for different types of couples and SES information disclosure.The sample comes from a comprehensive database of listings and property managersthat we constructed by scraping one of the largest online rental housing platforms basedon the four countries under analysis. The experiment was carried out in April 2022,and the experimental design involved sending inquiries to property managers using thefillable forms available online. Each property manager received a single inquiry froma randomly assigned fictitious couple with a certain SES signal. We contacted 3,624property managers and received 1,195 responses—i.e., an overall response rate of 33%. Inthe remainder of this section, we describe the salient aspects of the experiment.2.1 Property managersWe collected information on all available listings and property managers from a majoronline rental housing platform in the four countries under analysis. We focused on apart-ments for rent in downtown and suburban areas in the four capital cities and the country’ssecond-largest city. The cities included are Buenos Aires and Rosario in Argentina, Bo-gota and Medellin in Colombia, Quito and Guayaquil in Ecuador, and Lima and Arequipain Peru.4For each listing, we gathered detailed information on its characteristics: the headingof the advertisement and its publication date, the name of the property manager, thegeographical location of the apartment, the number of rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, andgarages, the size in squared meters, and the rental cost per month. All this informationwas collected the night before the messages were sent.We imposed several restrictions on the collected sample. First, we dropped the prop-erties intended for professional or commercial use only, larger than 200 square meters,with more than four rooms, or published before July 1, 2021. Also, we kept only one4Table A.1 lists the districts that are included in the metropolitan areas of each city. We were notable to record the information corresponding to downtown Medellin. However, we collected informationon its suburban districts, which include most property managers from metropolitan Medellin publishingon the online platform.6listing per property manager (the most recent one) to avoid contacting the same propertymanager more than once by each applicant.Our final sample includes the 3,624 property managers that satisfy the above re-strictions. Table A.3 reports the distribution of property managers in the final sampleacross countries. The sample size is among the largest in correspondence studies assessingdiscrimination against homosexual or transgender people in the housing market.52.2 Message designThe inquiries were sent using standard means used by any prospective renter. In ourcase, we sent customized scripts through a fillable form available for each listing on theonline platform. We built a baseline script and varied it along two dimensions: theperceived type of couple and the SES signal disclosure. The baseline script expressedinterest in renting the apartment and asked to arrange a visit. In the high-SES script, weadditionally informed that the two partners are professionals with stable jobs and thatthey have collateral.The property managers would infer the type of couple from the names of the twopartners. The names appear in the message body and in the closing signature line. Weused the most popular male and female names in each country, which are not likely tobe identified with other potentially discriminated groups in Latin America. Table A.4lists these first and last names. Partner 1 is the partner filling out the online form andsending the message. Partner 1 always uses a male name. His name is also observed intwo additional fields submitted through the online form: the prospective renter’s nameand email address.2.2.1 Script templateThe message was written in Latin American Spanish (see Table A.5). Below we show theEnglish version of the script template.\"Hello, my name is ${FILL_PARTNER_1}, together with my partner${FILL_PARTNER_2} we are looking for a place to rent, and we are veryinterested in this property. ${FILL_SES_SIGNAL}. We would like to pay avisit soon, what day could we go? We look forward to your response, thankyou very much.${FILL_PARTNER_1} and ${FILL_PARTNER_2}\"We fill the text between \"${}\" in the template with specific randomized components.In FILL_PARTNER_1 and FILL_PARTNER_2 we use male or female names to suggest5Related papers for European countries are based on samples between 400 and 800 listings (Ahmedand Hammarstedt (2008) and Ahmed et al. (2008) for Sweden; Koehler et al. (2018) for Serbia; Ahujaand Lyons (2019) for Ireland; Gouveia et al. (2020) for Portugal). Lauster and Easterbrook (2011) sentinquiries to 1669 listings in Canada. Only Schwegman (2018) and Friedman et al. (2013) for the UnitedStates have much larger sample sizes of up to more than 6,000 listings. For a more general review of fieldexperiments to identify discrimination in the housing market, see Table 2 in Bertrand and Duflo (2017).7different gender identities or sexual orientations of couples. In FILL_SES_SIGNAL weinclude a sentence with additional information to signal a high SES. Also, we created asecond script version that provides the same information but slightly differently worded.The second panel of Table A.5 shows the second script in Spanish.62.2.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity variationIn the baseline script, FILL_PARTNER_1 is a male name and FILL_PARTNER_2 isa female name. Thus the couple signing the baseline script is likely to be perceived asheterosexual by the property manager. To build our second fictitious type of couple,we vary the couple’s sexual orientation by using a male name for both partners, thussuggesting that it is a gay male couple. Finally, to build our fictitious trans couple, we varythe gender identity of the second partner. We do so by filling FILL_PARTNER_2 witha female name followed with the clarification \"(she is trans)\", so the property managerwould perceive this couple heterosexual with a trans woman.Notice that in the first version of the script the names appear in the message bodyand in the closing signature line, but in the second version of the script the names appearonly in the closing signature line (see Table A.5). Although this difference could imply aweaker signal of the sexual orientation or gender identity in the latter, we show that ourresults are robust to the script version in the robustness analysis.2.2.3 Socioeconomic status variationIn addition to varying perceived sexual orientation and gender identity, we also vary theinformation provided to signal socioeconomic status. In the baseline script, we leave theFILL_SES_SIGNAL component empty. Since no explicit information on SES is providedin the baseline script, the baseline couple would likely be perceived as heterosexual withan average socioeconomic level, which we refer to as neutral. To signal a high SES, weinform that both renters are professionals with stable jobs and have rental collateral.2.3 RandomizationThe randomization assignment of treatments to property managers was done within coun-try and unconditionally on any characteristic. For each country, we assigned 1/3 of theproperty managers to be contacted by each type of couple—i.e., heterosexual, gay male,and trans couple. Next, within each type of couple, we randomly assigned the neutral orhigh-SES signal to 2/3 and 1/3 of the property managers, respectively.6The scripts are responsive to cultural and language differences across countries. For instance, theverb rentar stands for the English to rent in Colombia, while the other countries use the verb alquilar.See Table A.6 with the list of words that differ across countries. The scripts were tested in two pilotscarried out in February and March 2022.82.4 Implementation, data collection and primary outcomesWe contacted 3,624 property managers through the contact forms available on the onlineplatform. Our inquiries were sent between April 19 and 20, from 10:30 AM to 5:30 PMUTC-3.As specified in the pre-analysis plan, the time window for attaining a valid responsewas limited to seven days. Past this limit, the observations were classified as non-responses. Automatic responses were also classified as non-responses. Overall, we ob-tained 1,195 responses—i.e., an average response rate of 33%. Once the interaction withthe property managers was completed, we matched the responses to the listing data,which identifies the treatment as well as characteristics of the apartment and propertymanager as described in Subsection 2.1.7We focus on three outcomes of interest: (i) the probability of receiving a responseor call-back rate, (ii) the probability of receiving a positive response or positive-responserate, and (iii) the probability of receiving an invitation to visit the property or invitationrate. Responses are classified as positive if property managers respond that the propertyis still available. If, in addition, they mention the possibility of visiting the property orask the couple to continue the conversation by phone and provide a contact number, thepositive response is in turn classified as an invitation.83 Final sample and design validationOf the 3,624 observations in our sample, 2,410 (67%) correspond to neutral couples—i.e.,couples not disclosing the high-SES signal—and 1,214 (33%) to high-SES couples. TableA.2 shows the distribution across couples and SES signals. Of the total inquiries, 2,000correspond to Argentina, 801 to Colombia, 348 to Ecuador, and 475 to Peru. Column 1in Table A.3 shows the number of inquiries per city.Table 1 contains descriptive statistics of the sampled property managers and rentalunits. Exploration of the table confirms that the randomized components are effectivelybalanced across treatment groups within each country. For instance, about half of theinquiries we sent use script version 1 for each country and treatment group. More impor-tantly, the table also verifies that property managers and rental unit characteristics arebalanced across treatment groups within country, thus validating the experiment. Forinstance, all types of couples inquired about apartments of the same average price perroom. The remaining apartment characteristic are the number of rooms and whether theapartment is located in the capital city or the country’s second city. Regarding prop-erty managers, we have their size as proxied by the number of listings for each propertymanager or by an indicator of whether this number exceeds the sample median. Overall,7To minimize the likelihood of an agent holding unavailable a rental unit due to our request, weresponded to all inquiry replies by mentioning that we were no longer interested in that listing.8This classification was specified in the Pre-analysis Plan (AEARCTR-0009012) and was done byresearch assistants not knowledgeable about which treatment was used to contact each listing.9these characteristics are balanced across treatment groups in each country.We received 1,195 responses out of 3,624 inquiries—i.e., an overall call-back rate of33%.

We received 1,036 responses confirming that theapartment was still available—i.e., an average positive-response rate of 29%—and 854invitations—i.e., an average invitation rate of 24%.

Call-back Positive response Invitation  Gay TransNote: Panel (a) shows average rates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for each type ofcouple when no SES information is disclosed. The 2,410 inquiries that correspond to neutral couples aretaken as a base to compute the percentages. Panel (b) shows the gap in the previous rates relative toheterosexual couples.11For neutral heterosexual couples, the average call-back rate is 34.4%, and the positive-response rate is 30.3%. Neutral gay-male couples receive a fewer responses and positiveresponses—33.6% and 29.2%, respectively—although the gap relative to heterosexual cou-ples is not statistically significant. In contrast, neutral trans couples receive significantlyfewer responses than heterosexual or gay couples. The call-back rate for trans coupleswith no high-SES signal is 27.7%, and the positive-response rate is only 22.2%. Theseresults imply a call-back rate differential of 19% and a positive-response rate differentialof 27% lower for neutral trans couples relative to neutral heterosexual couples. The gapsbetween couples are similar when comparing invitation rates: there is no statistically sig-nificant difference between gay male and heterosexual couples, but trans couples receivesignificantly fewer invitations. The invitation rate for neutral trans couples is 23% lowerrelative to heterosexual couples. These results suggest the presence of large and statisti-cally significant discriminatory behavior against trans couples but not against gay malecouples.4.2 The role of additional information: signaling high SESNext, we explore whether our results are consistent with taste-based or statistical discrim-ination models. For example, differences in response rates or the response type acrossgroups might be evidence of prejudice against LGBTQ+ people, corresponding to taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957). But differences in responses may also arise fromstatistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973; Phelps, 1972). For instance, high-SES candi-dates might receive favorable treatment if property managers consider them more likelyto timely afford rental costs than candidates with lower SES. Under statistical discrimi-nation, if the share of high-SES candidates is perceived to be lower among couples in theminority group, then—absent additional information—property managers would replyless frequently o less positively to inquiries from minority couples. If a high-SES signalis provided, however, property managers should rely on this signal, potentially reducingreply gaps. To test whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based or statistical dis-crimination, we compare call-back rates, positive response rates, and invitation rates forthe same type of couple with different SES signals—i.e., neutral couples versus high-SEScouples. If statistical discrimination is prevalent, then the disclosure of the high-SESsignal should reduce the gaps observed for neutral couples in Figure 2.Figures 3 and 4 show how response rates change when couples signal a high SES.Heterosexual couples receive more responses, positive responses and invitations after dis-closing a high-SES signal—the outcomes increase by 3.2, 3.0 and 2.4 percentage points,respectively—, but the changes are not statistically significant. For gay male couples, wefind that the effect of disclosing a high-SES signal is virtually null for the three outcomes.In contrast, for trans couples, we find large and statistically significant differences whenSES information is revealed. When trans couples signal a high SES, their call-back rates,positive-response rates and invitation rates increase respectively by 7, 8 and 5 percent-12age points, implying differentials of 25%, 36% and 29% relative to trans couples with nohigh-SES signal. These results suggest the presence of statistical discrimination againsttrans couples.4.3 Conditional results from a probability modelNext, we explore whether the previous results hold in a multivariate framework by esti-mating the following linear probability model:Rij =α+ βgGij + βtTij + θh(H ×HighSES)ij + θg(G×HighSES)ij+ θt(T ×HighSES)ij + λc + λcap + φd + ηMj + γAij + µij .(1)The dependent variable Rij is an indicator that takes the value 1 if couple i receives aresponse/positive response/invitation from property manager j and zero otherwise; Hij ,Gij and Tij are indicators that take the value 1 if couple i is likely perceived by propertymanager j as heterosexual, gay male or trans, respectively; HighSES is an indicator thattakes the value 1 if couple i discloses a high-SES signal; H ×HighSES, G×HighSESand T × HighSES are interaction terms; λc is a set of country dummy variables andλcap is an indicator of capital city; φd is a set of experimental design controls (indicatorsof the script version and the name of the potential renter sending the inquiry, and theorder of the inquiry sent by the specific email account); vectorMj includes characteristicsof the property manager (the size is proxied by the number of ads in the platform andwhether it has branches or is a franchise) and vector Aj controls for characteristics of theapartment (monthly rental price per room and number of rooms). Coefficients βg andβt in equation 1 capture the differential treatment given to neutral gay male and neutraltrans couples, respectively, relative to neutral heterosexual couples. The coefficients θh,θg and θt capture the differential effect of signaling a high SES within each type of couple.Table 2 reports the estimated coefficients from equation 1 for the three outcomes ofinterest. The first five columns focus on the probability of receiving a response. Column 1reports the unconditional results—i.e., the baseline model that only includes a constant,dummy variables for gay and trans couple, and the interactions between the high-SESdummy and the heterosexual, gay and trans indicators. These results coincide with thosediscussed in the previous subsections and shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4. Then, columns 2 to5 gradually incorporate different controls: country and capital city dummies (column 2),experiment design controls (column 3), characteristics of the property manager (column4), and characteristics of the rental unit (column 5). The following columns summarize themain results for the probability of receiving a positive response or an invitation based onthe baseline specification (columns 6 and 8, respectively) and on the model that includes13Figure 3: Call-back, positive response, and invitation rates for neutral and high-SEScouples.(a) Average call-back rates34.433.627.737.633.134.5242832364044Call-back rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SES(b) Average positive-response rates30.329.222.233.330.1 30.22025303540Positive response rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SES(c) Average invitation rates24.125.518.526.525.123.9101520253035Invitation rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SESNote: Each panel shows the average rate with its 95% confidence intervals for each type of couple withand without the high-SES signal.14Figure 4: Gap in call-back, positive response, and invitation rates between neutral andhigh-SES couples.3.2-0.56.83.00.88.02.4-0.45.4-10-5051015Gap high-SES relative to neutral couple (p.p.)

The main results are as follows. First, we find no statistically significant differ-ences in call-back rates or the type of responses between neutral gay male and neutralheterosexual couples. Neutral gay male couples receive about one percentage point fewerresponses and positive responses and 1.3 percentage points more invitations than hetero-sexual couples. However, these differences are small and never statistically significant.On the contrary, neutral trans couples receive much fewer responses, positive responsesand invitations than the other couples. The gaps relative to neutral heterosexual couplesare between 6 and 8 percentage points, which are highly statistically significant acrossspecifications. When assessing the effect of a high-SES signal, we never find statisticallysignificant effects for heterosexual or gay male couples. For instance, the call-back rate forheterosexual couples increases with the high-SES signal by between 3.2 and 1.3 percentagepoints depending on the specification, but this change is never statistically significant.The negative coefficients associated with the high-SES signal for gay couples is surprising,although these are generally close to zero and never statistically significant. In contrastto these results, we find large and statistically significant effects of signaling a high SESfor trans couples. As a result, the gaps between trans and heterosexual couples disappear9We prefer the model with no rental unit controls to avoid missing observations, but results are robustacross specifications.15once the high-SES signal is revealed, as reported in the lower panel of Table 2.As detailed in Appendix C , the results are robust to alternative exercises where wevary our sample definitions, valid response definitions, as well as including additionalcontrols such as manager fixed effects.Table 2: Probability of receiving a response, a positive response or an invitation.Call-back rate Positive response rate Invitation rate(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)Gay -0.735 -0.782 -0.800 -0.803 -0.863 -1.046 -1.114 1.362 1.326(2.100) (2.006) (1.996) (1.988) (1.893) (1.933) (1.857) (2.228) (2.250)Trans -6.665*** -6.708*** -6.777*** -6.743*** -6.744*** -8.115*** -8.221*** -5.592*** -5.689***(2.100) (2.102) (2.115) (2.091) (1.921) (1.890) (1.863) (1.833) (1.818)Hetero x High SES 3.231 3.146 1.390 1.464 1.633 2.957 1.325 2.368 1.278(3.284) (3.347) (3.086) (3.072) (3.217) (3.092) (3.030) (3.073) (3.108)Gay x High SES -0.540 -0.432 -2.169 -2.308 -1.888 0.850 -0.871 -0.376 -1.542(2.450) (2.372) (2.643) (2.692) (2.812) (2.229) (2.395) (1.933) (1.957)Trans x High SES 6.815*** 6.953*** 5.187** 5.114** 5.199** 8.046*** 6.442*** 5.383*** 4.325**(2.505) (2.336) (2.536) (2.424) (2.517) (2.131) (2.124) (2.031) (1.990)Constant 34.360*** 39.043*** 43.826*** 44.808*** 40.378*** 30.296*** 38.476*** 24.138*** 29.940***(1.920) (2.239) (3.017) (3.489) (4.635) (1.753) (2.982) (1.821) (3.306)Country & capital city Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes YesdummiesExperiment design controls Yes Yes Yes Yes YesProperty manager charact.

The bottom panel shows the coefficientsand standard errors of the difference in each outcome between gay and heterosexual couples, and between trans and heterosexual couples, when ahigh-SES signal is provided.4.4 DiscussionIn this subsection, we discuss some of the results that emerge from the experiment.A simple model is provided in Appendix B to help illustrate the interpretation. Themodel represents a situation where individuals belonging to different groups seek to renta property, and the property manager has to decide whether or not to respond to theirinquiries. There is a minority group A—gay male and trans couples in our experiment—,and a majority group B—the heterosexual couples.In our experiment, couples reveal their sexual orientation or gender identity, thusthe model assumes that the property manager knows the group to which each candi-date belongs. The property manager might have a distaste for minorities—represented inthe model as a disutility (d > 0). This disutility reflects taste-based discrimination. Inaddition, there is an average cost (k > 0) associated with no high-SES couples. The prob-16ability of having a high SES might vary across types of couples, giving rise to statisticaldiscrimination.Although simple, this model has some testable implications to shed light on the mech-anisms underlying our results. When couples do not disclose their socioeconomic sta-tus—the neutral couples in our experiment—, the difference in the call-back rate acrosstypes of couples captures the existence of discrimination. However, we cannot identifywhether it is taste-based or statistical discrimination from this unique variation. But, ifthe gaps in call-back rates between different couple types vary when information aboutSES is revealed, that would be consistent with the existence of statistical discrimination,suggesting that property managers’ beliefs about the distribution of SES differ acrosstypes of couples. For instance, property managers could expect that gay couples are onaverage poorer than heterosexual couples, given the existence of labor market discrimi-nation against gay men, and therefore would be less inclined to reply to their inquiries.10On the contrary, it could be that property managers believe that gay male couples areon average richer than heterosexual couples due to the well-known gender earnings gapin favor of men.In our experiment, we find no significant differences in response rates, positive-responserates or invitation rates between neutral gay couples and neutral heterosexual couples,consistent with absence of discrimination against gay men, at least at this stage of thehousing search. We also do not find evidence of statistical discrimination against gaymale couples since there are no significant changes in response rates after the high-SESsignal is revealed.Regarding trans couples, we find evidence of discrimination compared to heterosexualand gay male couples in the absence of information on socioeconomic status. As dis-cussed previously, neutral trans couples receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positiveresponses, and 23% fewer invitations than neutral heterosexual couples. Absent any otherinformation, this gap could be due to taste-based or statistical discrimination. In the firstcase, the gap would arise from a distaste of the property manager for trans couples. Inthe second case, however, the gap would be the result of property managers’ beliefs abouttrans couples’ SES. For instance, as trans people are less likely to be employed and havehigher poverty rates than otherwise similar cisgender individuals (Carpenter et al., 2022),absent socioeconomic information, property managers might assume that trans couplesare less likely to be from a high SES. Even more, it may be that property managers fearthat the apartment is used for some illegal activity if the renter is trans.11 Therefore,10See for instance Neumark (2018), which surveys evidence on discrimination in the labor marketagainst gays and lesbians coming from experimental research.11Stereotypes usually link trans people to sex work. In Argentina, for instance, the public debateduring the nineties gave rise to the construction of a political-social identity of the transvestite-transcollective closely related to sex work (Guerrero and Miranda, 2018). Usually the lack of access to formalemployment tends to expose trans persons to dangerous working conditions, often forcing them to turnto sex work as a survival strategy (OEA, 2020). According to a survey on the trans population carriedout in 2019 in the Buenos Aires Province (PBA, 2019), 41.7% of LGBTQ+ people engaged in sex workas their main source of income.17signaling high-SES might be particularly beneficial for this group.The fact that the differential treatment against trans couples disappears when thehigh-SES signal is provided suggests that part—if not most—of the observed discrimina-tion against trans couples is statistical.5 Heterogeneity analysisIn this section, we study whether discrimination levels and their patterns vary acrosscountries, with property manager characteristics or the rental unit. This analysis wouldallow us to assess which variables predict higher degrees of discrimination while providinga deeper understanding of the behaviors leading to the observed discrimination patterns.This section presents results on our main outcome: call-back rates. Results are similarfor positive-response rates and invitation rates.5.1 Does discrimination vary across countries?Average call-back rates vary across countries: from 38% in Argentina, 31% in Ecuadorand Peru, and only 22% in Colombia (Table A.3 reports these figures).12Figure 5 shows the average call-back rates in each country for the different types ofcouples. These are unconditional call-back rates, similar to those in column 1 of Table2. Table A.7 in the Appendix reports all estimated coefficients and the correspondingstandard errors, and shows in Panel B that the results are robust to the inclusion ofcontrols as in column 4 of Table 2.First, we find the same pattern regarding discrimination against trans couples in allcountries. Trans couples receive fewer responses than heterosexual couples, but the levelsof discrimination differ. For instance, in Ecuador and Peru, trans couples receive 38%and 33% fewer responses than heterosexual couples. In Argentina, the gap is only 14%and the gap is 17% in Colombia, but it is not precisely estimated.Another common pattern to the four countries is that discrimination against transcouples decreases or disappears with the high-SES signal. In other words, the sign of theTrans × HighSES coefficient is positive for all the countries, though there are differ-ences in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. For instance, the effect is notstatistically significant in Argentina or Peru.13On the contrary, for gay couples, we find marked differences across countries. Whilewe find no evidence of discrimination against neutral gay couples in none of the coun-tries—the Gay coefficients are very close to zero and not statistically significant—, wefind heterogeneous effects of the high-SES signal. In Ecuador, for instance, the high-SES12The share of each country in our sample is unbalanced, so some results are more reliable than others.Of the 3,624 inquiries in our sample, 2000 (55%) correspond to Argentina, 801 (22%) to Colombia, 475(13%) to Peru and 348 (less than 10%) to Ecuador. Also, the response rates are quite different acrosscountries.13However, the high-SES signal for trans couples does have a significant effect in Buenos Aires, whichrepresents 95% of the sample for Argentina.18signal significantly increases the call-back rate for gay couples. In Colombia, the effectgoes in the same direction but it is not statistically significant. In contrast, in Argentinaand Peru, the coefficient associated with the interaction term Gay×HighSES is negativeand also statistically significant for the former. This is a counterintuitive result in lightof the theory we discussed at the end of Section 4 and requires further analysis beyondwhat our data can test.Figure 5: Average call-back rates by country.39.4 39.833.842.735.239.21525354555Call-back rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SESArgentina22.318.1 18.424.2 25.328.11525354555Call-back rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SESColombia31.2 32.119.238.548.729.71525354555Call-back rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SESEcuador35.5 35.023.837.726.429.61525354555Call-back rate (%)  Hetero Gay Trans  Neutral High SESPeruNote: Each panel shows average call-back rates with their 95% confidence intervals for each type of couplewith and without the high-SES signal in each country.5.2 Heterogeneity by type of property managerDiscrimination may vary depending on the type of property manager either, due to dif-ferences in tastes or because they have different perceptions or information about thecharacteristics of certain groups. Also, the motivation to rent the property, how theyweigh different characteristics of potential tenants and even the emotional attachment tothe property can be very different across different property managers.To characterize property managers, we rely on proxies of their size that could also beassociated with different organizational structures. The dimensions we consider are thefollowing: (i) whether the number of ads of the property manager in the online platform19is below or above the sample median; (ii) whether the property manager has a single adin the online platform; and (iii) whether the property manager has the same name asother property managers in different districts. We interpret that property managers witha single listing in the online platform are more likely to be private owners as opposed toreal state agents or firms.14 When different property managers share a common name weinterpret it is a franchise or a multi-branch firm.Smaller property managers—i.e., size below the median, private owner or not fran-chise—exhibit higher call-back rates but also higher discrimination (see columns 1 to 9in Table A.8). Figure 6 shows the gaps in call-back rates between neutral trans (gay)couples and neutral heterosexual couples. The call-back rate differential for trans couplesrelative to heterosexual couples is somewhat wider for smaller property managers. Forinstance, private owners respond 25% less to trans couples than to heterosexual couples,while the gap is only 17% for real state agencies. Despite these differences, we find evi-dence of discrimination against trans couples for all types of property managers and thedifferences between property managers are not statistically significant. We also find for alltypes of property managers that the high-SES signal reduces or eliminates discriminationfor trans couples (see Figure 7). The coefficients are always positive and in most caseshighly statistically significant.For gay couples and regardless of the type of property manager, we again find noevidence of discrimination. Also, we again find a negative effect on call-back rates whengay couples signal a high SES to property managers below the median size or privateowners. Although the coefficients are not statistically significant, this counterintuitiveresult deserves further analysis.5.3 The higher the demand, the greater the discriminationWe also look at how discrimination changes with the time elapsed since the property wasfirst listed. The fact that a property remains in the platform after a certain period of timemay mean that other properties were preferred or that the demand for that particularproperty is lower than expected. On the other hand, the demand could be higher fornewer properties. Given everything else, profit-maximizing behavior would lead prop-erty managers to discriminate less the longer the property lasts on the platform. Butcausality may go in the opposite direction: when the property managers are more de-manding—perhaps more discriminating—it may take longer to rent the property. In thiscase we should find greater discrimination the longer the property lasts on the platform.To explore this issue, we split the sample between ‘old’ and ‘new’ listings. We defineold listings as those that have been published on the platform for at least 24 days—the14We would like to compare the results between real estate companies and private owners, but thisinformation is not available in the online platform. Based on similar listings in another online platformwith extensive coverage in Argentina and Peru, we know that about 17% and 14%, respectively, correspondto private owners.20Figure 6: Heterogeneity in call-back rates by type of property manager, duration of listing,rental price and competition level.(a) Gap in call-back rates between neutral trans and heterosexual couples.-16-12-8-404812Gap trans relative to hetero (neutral)Small PMLarge PMNot franchiseFranchisePrivate ownerRental agencyNew listingOld listingLower priceHigher priceHigh competitionLow competition(b) Gap in call-back rates between neutral gay and heterosexual couples.-16-12-8-404812Gap gay relative to hetero (neutral)Small PMLarge PMNot franchiseFranchisePrivate ownerRental agencyNew listingOld listingLower priceHigher priceHigh competitionLow competitionNote: Panels (a) and (b) show the the point estimate and the 95% confidence interval of the gap incall-back rate between gay and hetero couples and between trans and hetero couples, respectively, whenno SES information is provided.21Figure 7: Heterogeneity in the effect of the high-SES signal by type of property manager,duration of listing, rental price and competition level.(a) Gap between high-SES and neutral trans couples.-505101520Gap high relative to neutralSmall PMLarge PMNot franchiseFranchisePrivate ownerRental agencyNew listingOld listingLower priceHigher priceHigh competitionLow competition(b) Gap between high-SES and neutral gay couples.-15-10-50510Gap high relative to neutralSmall PMLarge PMNot franchiseFranchisePrivate ownerRental agencyNew listingOld listingLower priceHigher priceHigh competitionLow competition(c) Gap between high-SES and neutral heterosexual couples.-10-5051015Gap high relative to neutralSmall PMLarge PMNot franchiseFranchisePrivate ownerRental agencyNew listingOld listingLower priceHigher priceHigh competitionLow competitionNote: Each panel shows the point estimate and the 95% confidence interval of the gap in call-back ratefor each type of couple when the high-SES signal is provided relative to the case of no signal.22sample median—while new listings appeared in the platform within the last 23 days.15We find that inquiries about new properties receive more responses than inquiriesabout the old ones—38% and 31%, respectively. However, discrimination is also higherfor the new properties, at least discrimination against trans couples. The call-back ratefor trans couples inquiring about new properties is significantly lower than for hetero-sexual couples. The gap disappears when trans couples signal a high SES (see Figures6 and 7, and columns 10 to 12 in Table A.8). In other words, the Trans and Trans ×HighSES coefficients have a similar magnitude—almost 8 percentage points—but oppo-site signs—negative and positive, respectively—and both are highly statistically signifi-cant. In contrast, we find no evidence of discrimination against trans couples for inquiriesregarding old properties. This suggests that property managers discriminate more whenit comes to newer listings, which might be associated with expecting higher demand. Ifthe cheapest properties are the first to be rented, this behavior would imply restrictionson the access of trans couples to the cheapest properties.5.4 Heterogeneity by rental priceWe next analyze how discrimination varies with the rental price per room. We split thesample into two groups: the high- and low-price groups depending on whether the priceper room is above or below the average price per room in the corresponding district. Wefind large and statistically significant discrimination against trans couples asking aboutlow-price properties but no statistically significant evidence of discrimination when theyinquire about high-price properties (see Figure 6 and columns 13 to 15 in Table A.8). Thisresult is linked to that discussed in the previous point and suggests that trans couplescould suffer restrictions in accessing the best price opportunities.5.5 Does competition affect discrimination?We expect competition to reduce statistical discrimination. To explore this issue, we splitthe sample between property managers who were exposed to more or less competitionwithin their districts. We take the number of listings published on the platform withindistrict as a proxy for competition. We thus define the high- and low-competition groupsdepending on whether they belong to districts above or below the median number oflistings.We find no evidence that discrimination against neutral trans couples is affected bycompetition—the coefficients associated with the Trans dummy are of similar magnitudeand statistically significant for both groups (see Figure 6 and columns 16 to 18 in Ta-ble A.8). The lack of increased discrimination in less competitive districts is consistentwith the lack of taste-based discrimination as predicted in Becker’s model. Moreover,only property managers in the high-competition group reduce discrimination when transcouples signal a high SES (see Figure 7).15We find similar results when taking other thresholds, such as one month.236 ConclusionThis paper assesses the extent of discrimination against homosexual and transgenderindividuals in the rental housing markets in four Latin American countries: Argentina,Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. To that end, we conducted a large-scale correspondencestudy where fictitious couples send inquiries to property managers expressing interest inrenting a property listed in an online platform.To identify discriminatory behavior based on the renter’s perceived gender identityor sexual orientation, we randomly vary the type of couple between heterosexual, gaymale, and heterosexual couple where the female partner is a trans woman. In addition,we randomly assign a high-SES signal across couples to explore whether the evidence isconsistent with taste-based or statistical discrimination.Overall, we find strong discrimination against trans couples compared to gay male andheterosexual couples. Specifically, when information about SES is not revealed (whichwe refer to as neutral SES), the call-back rates, positive-response rates and invitationrates for heterosexual and gay male couples are similar. However, trans couples receive19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations relative toheterosexual couples. Importantly, we find no statistically significant effect of disclosingthe high-SES signal on any outcome for heterosexual or gay male couples. However, wedo find large and positive effects of the high-SES signal for trans couples. Their responserate increases by 25%, the positive-response rate increases by 36% and the invitation rateincreases by 29%, closing the gap relative to heterosexual or gay male couples with highSES.These results suggest the presence of discrimination against trans couples in the LatinAmerican online rental housing market, which—at least in part—is due to statisticaldiscrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favored overgay male couples, nor evidence of discriminatory constraints consistent with statisticaldiscrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples. There is an important considerationto these findings, as with all correspondence studies. We observe a first interaction withproperty managers and not the final rental outcome.We also find that discrimination against trans couples intensifies in certain contexts.For instance, we find stronger evidence of statistical discrimination the higher the com-petition faced by property managers. Also, that property managers discriminate morewhen it comes to newer listings or to low-price properties, suggesting that trans couplescould suffer restrictions in accessing the best price opportunities.24ReferencesAhmed, A.

We follow the intuitionof discrimination models applied to labor markets (Neumark, 2018) or housing markets(Ewens et al., 2014). In particular, we are interested in understanding what drives theproperty manager to continue or not with the interaction with a certain candidate uponreceiving an inquiry.If she continues with the interaction, she obtains an expected return v > 0. Thisvalue v captures the rent and additional cost not explicitly modeled. However, she alsohas a reservation value s of not answering the message. This reservation value s followsa distribution F : [0,+∞) → [0, 1] and captures alternative scenarios at the moment ofreceiving the inquiry that are not linked with the potential candidate characteristics. Thevalue of s is higher if the property manager has already received many inquiries for thesame property, she is dealing with multiple properties to rent, or the property is “hot”in the market. It is lower if the property owner is in a hurry to find a tenant or if theproperty has been listed for a while.Consequently the property manager observes the expected return to continue withthe potential candidate v, and chooses to continue with the interaction if s ≤ v; i.e.,the reservation value is lower than the expected return to continue. Ex-ante, a potentialtenant anticipates that the property manager replies the inquiry with probability Pr(s ≤v) = F (v).With this decision making process in mind, we incorporate two sources of discrimina-tion for candidates belonging to a minority group A. First, a taste-based discrimination.Suppose that the property manager assigns a valuation v to a candidate belonging to amajority group B and a valuation v− d to a candidate belonging to a minority group A,then d > 0 stands for a dislike cost that generates the taste-based discrimination. Theprobability of replying is F (v) for candidates belonging to group B and F (v − d) forcandidates belonging to group A. The implication of this taste-based discrimination isthat the probability of replying an inquiry is lower for a candidate in the minority groupA, as F (v − d) < F (v).Second, we introduce statistical discrimination (we focus only on this source of dis-crimination in this paragraph). We assume that there are some tenants with low socioe-conomic status that may generate some unexpected cost when renting a property. Forinstance, this cost may involve financial issues or problems with neighbors requiring anintervention from the owner. We assume there is an ex-ante expected cost k > 0 anda proportion q of tenants associated with these cases. Consequently a candidate gener-ates expected profits of (v − k, v) with probability (q, 1 − q) depending on the unknowncharacteristic of the tenant. Then the property manager anticipates an expected returnv− q k. The statistical discrimination is generated when the proportion q differs betweencandidates in groups A and B, where we assume qA > qB. If qA > qB, v−qA k < v−qB k33and, then, the probability of replying to an inquiry is lower for a candidate belonging toa minority group A than for a candidate belonging to a majority group B.Mixing both the taste-based and the statistical discrimination is simple. A candidatefrom group A generates an expected return of v − qA k − d to the property manager,where a candidate from group B generates an expected return v − qB k. The probabilityof answering an inquiry from a candidate in group A is lower than from a candidatein group B because of the taste-based discrimination d and the higher proportion ofcandidates with expected cost k (qA > qB). For simplicity we assume that v > k + d.In this environment we assume that majority-minority condition is revealed. Addition-ally, a signal about the socioeconomic status may be disclosed, implying that a candidatedisclosing a signal will not incur in the cost k regardless of whether she belongs to groupA or B. Instead, if the socioeconomic status is concealed, the cost k may or may notexists (with probability (q, 1− q)). Then, four cases are identified:1. Minority group A with signal: expected return v − d, receiving a reply with proba-bility F (v − d).2. Minority group A with no signal: expected return v − qA k − d, receiving a replywith probability F (v − qA k − d).3. Majority group B with signal: expected return v, receiving a reply with probabilityF (v).4. Majority group B with no signal: expected return v − qB k, receiving a reply withprobability F (v − qB k).Under some assumptions, we can derive some conclusions comparing these scenarios:• Corollary i: the difference in the probability of replying between cases 4 and 2captures the existence of taste-based and/or statistical discrimination.• Corollary ii: the difference in the probability of replying between cases 3 and 1captures the existence mainly of taste-based discrimination.Expanding this analysis to more than two groups is straightforward. For instance thispaper relates three groups: a majority group of heterosexual couples with two minoritygroups: gay-male and transgender couples. However, there are some caveats to be con-sidered in the extension. First, the effects of discrimination may not be the same amongall minority groups; one group may be subject to statistical discrimination and the othermay not reveal any type of discrimination (at least in the stage considered). Second, thesignal may also have different impact or may convey different information depending onthe group. That is, the high-SES signal may be stronger when disclosed by trans couplesthan gay male couples because, for instance, the stronger barriers faced by the former inthe educational system and labor market.34C Robustness analysisIn this appendix, we perform several exercises to assess the robustness of our main results.Table C.1 shows the robustness results regarding the probability of receiving a response.As a basis for comparison the first column replicates the specification in column 4 of Table2—i.e., the model including all controls but the rental unit characteristics to avoid losing128 observations. Tables C.2 and C.3 show similar exercises for the positive-response andinvitation rates.Changing the geographic coverage of the sample. In the first exercise, we explore whetherour main results hold after changing the geographic coverage of the estimation sample.Therefore, we impose different restrictions to the estimation sample: (i) we keep onlythe capital city of each country with its suburban areas (column 2), (ii) we keep only thecapital city without its suburban areas (column 3), and (iii) we keep only districts with atleast one response (column 4). In all cases, our main results hold. The largest differencesappear in column 3—only capital cities without suburban areas—where we are left withless than half of the original sample, although the general conclusions do not change. Forexample, the coefficient of the Gay dummy remains negative but becomes much largerin absolute value and statistically significant. This is the only specification for which wefind evidence of discrimination against gay male couples.Changing definition of automatic responses. Determining whether a response was auto-matic required an analysis of both the content and style of the response that was carriedout by a team of research assistants. To rule out that our results depend on such a clas-sification, we complement this classification and use the time elapsed between sendingthe message and receiving a response. When the response arrives in a time less than acertain threshold, it is also classified as automatic and, therefore, as an invalid response.Column 5 of the table shows the results for a 2-minute threshold. Our results are robustto this change, as well as to other alternative thresholds.Changing the time window for attaining valid responses. The pre-analysis plan limits thetime window for a valid response to seven days. In this exercise, we modify this limit.Columns 6 and 7 of the table show the results when the time window is set to two days ortwo weeks, respectively. In both cases our main results are not sensitive to these changes.Changing the script. In columns 8 and 9, we evaluate the robustness of our results tothe script version. The result of discrimination against trans couples holds under bothscripts. This is very important since in script 1 could be perceived as having a strongertrans signal than in script 2.16 For script 1 we also find a positive and significant effect ofthe high-SES signal not only for trans couples but also for heterosexual couples. Instead,16Remember that script 1 begins with \"Hello, my name is $ {FILL_PARTNER_1}, together withmy partner ${FILL_PARTNER_2} (she is trans)\", while script 2 signalled the trans signal only in theclosing signature.35the high-SES signal from script 2 is weaker: the coefficients associated to the interactionterms are no statistically significant with script 2.Controlling for property managers fixed effects. Our experiment randomizes treatmentsacross property managers in each country. As a result, our sample is balanced in theobservable characteristics of these property managers as shown in Table 1. Given ran-domization, we should not worry about the possibility that the unobservables are unbal-anced. To have an additional control for these unobservables, we repeated the experimentby sending a second round of messages to the same property managers varying the typeof couple or the SES signal. Although we also varied the script version between rounds,a caveat arises because receiving two similar inquires may seem suspicious to propertymanagers thus affecting their responses. Despite this, we think there is value in showingthese results as a robustness exercise.17Based on the responses to the two rounds of messages, we estimate equation 1 addingproperty manager fixed effects and report the results in column 10 of Table C.1. Again,our main results still hold, although the statistical significance of the effect of the high-SESsignal for trans couples is reduced.17The second round of messages took place in May 2022, two weeks after the first round. The ran-domization was conditional on the treatment received in the first round. For instance, we randomlyassigned one of the remaining five treatments to property managers who received a first inquiry from aneutral-SES heterosexual couple. The property managers who received the first inquiry from gay maleor transgender couples, received messages from heterosexual couples in the second round, half with ahigh-SES signal. Figure C.1 in Appendix A illustrates the randomization procedure and the resultingdistribution of inquiries across

    "abstract": "We assess the extent of discrimination against gay and transgender individuals in the rental housing markets of four Latin American countries. We conducted a large-scale field experiment building on the correspondence study methodology to examine interactions between property managers and fictitious couples engaged in searches in a major online rental housing platform. We find evidence of discriminatory behavior against heterosexual couples where the female partner is a transgender women (trans couples): they receive 19% fewer responses, 27% fewer positive responses, and 23% fewer invitations to showings than heterosexual couples. However, we find no evidence of discrimination against gay male couples. We also assess whether the evidence is consistent with taste-based discrimination or statistical discrimination models by comparing response rates when couples signal a high socioeconomic status (high SES). While we find no significant effect of the signal on call-back rates or the type of response for high-SES heterosexual or gay male couples, trans couples benefit when they signal a high SES. Their call-back, positive-response, and invitation rates increase by 25%, 36% and 29%, respectively. These results suggest the presence of discrimination against trans couples in the Latin American online rental housing market, which seems consistent with statistical discrimination. Moreover, we find no evidence of heterosexual couples being favoured over gay male couples, nor evidence of statistical discrimination for gay male or heterosexual couples.Fil: Abbate, Nicolas.
