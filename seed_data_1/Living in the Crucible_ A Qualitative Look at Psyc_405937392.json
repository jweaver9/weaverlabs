    "abstract": "Current research has become increasingly focused on examining the nature of intersectional identities. The intersectional identity of being both LGBT and Christian is difficult to maintain. Both communities are often in conflict, and this can create a great amount of distress. Many individuals who struggle to hold the intersectional identity of being LGBT and Christian choose one identity and drop the other. For this study, I examined the experience of psychologists who are able to hold both identities of being LGBT and Christian. I was interested in discovering resiliency factors, and whether graduate psychological training influenced participants’ ability to hold the intersectional identity of being LGBT and Christian. This study includes 7 qualitative interviews with psychologists who identify as both LGB and Christian. Findings indicate that integrating the identities of LGB and Christian is a difficult process that requires perseverance, and different participants handled their intersectional identity differently in regards to their social groups. The implications of these results for doctoral training and Intersectional Identity theory are discussed",
