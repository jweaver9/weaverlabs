LGBT health services,or health services offered through LGBT community organizations, have been available sinceat least the 1970s [7]. Available explanations for the origins of LGBT health services, such asthe increased community mobilization and explicit rejection of homophobia following theStonewall Riots of 1969 [5], do not sufficiently explain why health in particular has been soclosely and consistently linked to LGBT activism. Little is also known regarding how LGBThealth services may have evolved over time with the growing scientific understanding of LGBThealth needs. LGBT community organizations provided health services to at least 300,000 cli-ents in 2015 [8], suggesting that they still constitute a significant proportion of the healthcarelandscape for LGBT people today.Researchers have sought to understand LGBT patients’ experiences accessing healthcareservices and preferences for care [9–14]. These studies focus predominantly on the generalpopulation healthcare landscape and offer limited consideration for LGBT health services.This study is an effort to understand the origins of the LGBT health movement and to charac-terize the landscape of LGBT health services today in the United States. We begin with a reviewof early intersections of sexuality and health and the evolution of LGBT health services overtime. Informed by this, we present an asset map displaying the location and types of servicesprovided by LGBT community health centers today in relation to the population density ofLGBT people.Given the diversity of the LGBT community, it is prudent to describe how identity labelsare utilized in describing the findings below. For example, although not everyone outsideof heterosexual, cisgender (i.e., people whose sex assigned at birth is consistent with theirgender identity) identities would describe themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgen-der, the term LGBT is used to collectively refer all sexual minority, transgender, or gendernon-conforming people. Other terms will be incorporated to describe particular political,medical, or social moments or perspectives, rather than LGBT people themselves. Forexample, the term “homosexual” was used early in medical literature to refer to those withsame-sex attraction, and was often extended to those who may today identify today asbisexual or transgender as a result of the limited terminology used at the time. The term“homophile movement” was subsequently adopted by many LGBT people who began orga-nizing themselves in the 1950s. For a more in-depth overview of how these communityidentity labels have changed over time, both socially and scientifically, see Armstrong(2002), D’Emilio (2012), Weststrate & McLean (2010), and Young & Meyer (2005) [15–18].Finally, LGB and LGBT are used differentially to accurately describe the inclusion or exclu-sion of transgender (and other gender non-conforming people) from the LGBT healthmovement.LGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 2 / 18Competing interests: The authors have declaredthat no competing interests exist.Origins of LGBT (health) movements and servicesMichel Foucault’s The History of Sexuality [19] explores how notions of sexuality have beenconstructed, and how the boundaries of “legitimate” sexuality have been contested, histori-cally. There is no clear beginning to the relationships between sexuality, social and politicalmovements, and health. But the interplay of these factors in the formation of LGBT identitiesin the United States has origins in the mid-20th Century [16]. Prior to adopting more consoli-dated identities of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, unorganized and isolated individualsfirst sought to identify and connect with each other in the politically and socially hostile cli-mate following World War II [20]. In the midst of 1950s McCarthyism, two organizationsformed that would greatly influence the trajectory of what would ultimately become “LGBT”people in the United States: The Mattachine Society [20] and the Daughters of Bilitis [21].Both groups organized in secrecy, regularly published and distributed magazines and newslet-ters to subscribing members that debated the meaning of homosexuality, and provided medi-cal professionals’ perspectives on homosexuality [16, 20, 21]. Both groups came to promote thenotion that sexuality was constitutional to one’s identity, and that subscribing members were adiscriminated minority [20]. These moves toward self-acceptance and identity developmentwould ultimately encourage public advocacy for the rights and social acceptance of a broadercommunity.Concurrent with this early mobilization were several other pivotal developments thathelped the increasingly organized groups of LGBT people challenge the illness model of homo-sexuality. Several studies helped make a case for same-sex sexual behaviors as a normal andacceptable form of sexual expression, including Alfred Kinsey’s studies demonstrating thehigh frequency of same-sex behaviors among men [22] and women [23], Ford and Beach’s(1951) reports that same-sex sexual behaviors occurred naturally both within various animalspecies around the world and across numerous cultures globally [24], and Evelyn Hooker’s(1957) study found no mental health differences between heterosexual and homosexual menother than their status as homosexuals [25]. Early forms of activism among LGBT people lever-aged these studies in order to dismantle the definition of homosexuality as a psychologicaldisorder.In 1960, the first transgender-specific magazine in the United States, Transvestia, was pub-lished [26]. Like the publications distributed by the Mattachine Society and Daughters of Bili-tis, Transvestia incorporated social commentary, educational outreach, and readers’ ownautobiographical submissions. It also argued against the criminalization of gender non-con-forming dress and promoted early ideas of transgender people as a minority community [26].Transgender people continued to organize throughout the 1960s, developing community andactivist organizations and promoting research into medical gender confirmation procedures[26, 27].These efforts were vital in pushing back against anti-homosexual political action that pre-vailed following 1950s McCarthyism. The rise of consumerism, a growing working class ofwomen, and feminist and civil rights critiques following World War II resulted in many sexualand gender norms being dissolved or reconfigured. In response to the growing challenges tosexual and gender norms, federal, state, and local governments mobilized their resources“against the underground sexual world” ([28], pp. 288), framing “homosexuals” as both thesource of social decay and a threat to national security. LGBT people were sought out, arrested,and exposed under the guise of protecting the social order.In such a hostile climate, new forms of political and social organizing and advocacy wereneeded [28]. The Stonewall riots of 1969 represent a significant turning point for LGBT people,who not only protested against the frequent police raids in New York City but also organized aLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 3 / 18nationwide, grassroots liberation movement [16]. Though not by any means the first form ofpublic protest from LGBT people [29], it served as a very visible and forceful catalyst tonational organizing as sexual minorities began identifying services they could not adequatelyreceive elsewhere and providing for themselves [5, 16].Over 1,000 community-based organizations serving LGBT people emerged in the 1970s[16], following the opening of the first LGBT community center in Los Angeles in 1969 [7].However, upon the removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association’sDiagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1973 [30], a noticeable break occurred betweentransgender people and lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs). Transgender people, once apart of the collectives advocating for a progressive shift in how sexuality was viewed sociallyand politically, were entered into the DSM under a new pathology, “Gender Identity Disorderof Childhood” [31]. Transgender people were then systematically excluded from LGB groups,who wanted to distance themselves from notions of deviance and medical pathology thattransgender people now carried the burden of [32]. Likewise, feminist groups resisted theinclusion of transgender people, leaving them with few social and political allies throughoutthe 1970s and 1980s [26]. Medical, legal, and psychotherapeutic professionals working withtransgender people continued to provide healthcare, conduct research, and develop standardsof care via professional organizations like the World Professional Association for TransgenderHealth (WPATH; formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association,founded in 1966) [26, 33]. Such organizations were among the few resources that remained totransgender people through the 1980s.With homosexuality no longer included in the DSM, large numbers of LGB people wereable to create visible communities in urban hubs [4]. Though these communities by no meansflourished in all areas, the rapid growth of LGB organizations throughout the country enabledthe once disparate people to share information across communities and better serve their localneeds. It was soon recognized that many LGB people were stigmatized when accessing servicesin general healthcare settings, and as a result many LGB organizations took it upon themselvesto offer an alternative source of care [3, 6, 34].Evolution of LGB(T) health movement and servicesThe infrastructure for community-based health services was being established with the prolif-eration of LGB community centers throughout the country. However, lessons learned withinthe women’s health movement introduced the idea of uniquely “LGB” health issues. In 1973,the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective published the second edition of Our Bodies, Our-selves [35, 36]. As a part of recognizing women’s unique healthcare needs, one chapter focusedspecifically on lesbian health issues and the shortcomings of medicine and healthcare in meet-ing their needs. LGB community centers and activists began to consider the possibility ofunique health issues and disparities in need of specialized attention.These programmatic shifts are visible within both emerging and pre-established commu-nity centers of the 1970s. Fenway Community Health, founded in 1971 in Boston, Massachu-setts, was not initially established as an LGB community health center, but became the firstcommunity health center to develop expertise in LGB health services in response to the demo-graphic needs of its own staff and clients [37]. A similar expansion of services into healthoccurred in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia [5, 38]. By the mid-1980s, theNational Gay Task Force listed over 100 clinics and medical service programs and over 300counseling and mental health programs, with services ranging from testing and treatment forsexually transmitted infection to counseling and care for substance users, that were openlyLGBT friendly and accepting [5].LGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 4 / 18This combined community and institutional organizing would prove invaluable by theonset of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s. The federal government, and particularly President Regan,were slow to respond to the epidemic [2], but the HIV/AIDS crisis raised the stakes for LGBpeople to gain access to additional health resources. Many LGB organizations and activists lev-eraged the health implications of HIV/AIDS to raise awareness about such issues as domesticpartnerships, access to the sick and dying, inheritance, and housing [29]. At the communitylevel, gay men and their allies–particularly lesbians drawing upon their experiences in thereproductive rights and women’s movements–organized themselves into activist and advocacygroups such as the Gay Men’s Health Crisis in 1982 [39], and ACT UP in 1987 [2]. Meetingsheld by these groups disseminated the latest HIV research and prevention strategies, developed(often radical and militant) strategies for social and political advocacy, and identified and orga-nized social and healthcare services for men with HIV and AIDS who were unable to receiveadequate services elsewhere [2, 3]. LGB organizations rapidly responded by offering emotionaland practical support to those affected by HIV, counseling, sex education, home-based hospicecare, housing and other social services [1, 2].The action taken at the community level resulted in increased public awareness of HIV andAIDS and initiated action at the federal level. LGB health professionals and activists tookadvantage of the growing public attention by applying pressure to federal agencies and profes-sional organizations such as the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Food and DrugAdministration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the AmericanPublic Health Association (APHA), and the American Medical Association (AMA) [3, 40].Their goals were to raise national awareness about HIV/AIDS and the crisis among gay men,accelerate the clinical trial process for new treatments, and allocate additional research focusto gay men in particular [2, 3].However, the narrow focus on HIV over the course of the 1980s and 1990s re-associatedhomosexuality with illness after long-fought struggles to disassociate from the medical field[41, 42]. Though large amounts of federal funding were made available to research HIVamong gay men, little attention was given to other health issues among either gay men orLGBs in general [3]. In an effort to ensure that HIV would not dominate the discourse aroundLGB health issues, “a small and pioneering group of academic researchers began seeking to fillthe vacuum of knowledge about lesbian and gay, and particularly lesbian, health concerns”([3], pp. 138). At the same time, transgender people re-emerged to advocate for their ownuniquely transgender health issues, including issues related to HIV and gender confirmation[43, 44].Little has been written on the political, social, and historical milestones for transgender peo-ple during the 1980s. Transgender communities are believed to have concentrated “more onproviding mutual aid and support to their members than on broader social activism” duringthis time ([26], pp.113). On the other hand, the 1990s saw a burst of activity that sparked anincrease in activism. Ongoing debates within feminist studies and theory resulted in the devel-opment of a queer theory that legitimized transgender identities. HIV research also began torecognize transgender people as a “vulnerable” population in the era of AIDS, and transgenderpeople were increasingly incorporated into human rights laws and protections within munici-palities throughout the United States [26]. Once again advocating for issues as a collective,LGBT people together produced a large body of research pointing to diverse and complexhealth disparities [45–49]. Formerly LGB organizations began re-branding themselves asinclusive of transgender individuals, and a focus on LGBT health took shape at both commu-nity and national levels [3].The collective efforts of LGBT community centers, activists, and professionals culmi-nated in a variety of events that aided LGBT people in gaining national recognition as anLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 5 / 18underserved population in health. These include: professional health associations’ recogni-tion of LGBT caucuses [5]; the 1999 report on lesbian health by the Institute of Medicine(IOM) [50]; a white paper sponsored by the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA)leading to the inclusion of LGB people in Healthy People 2010 [51]; the first special issue onLGBT health by the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) in 2001 [52]; the 2002 recog-nition of the first LGBT community health center as a Federally-Qualified Health Center(FQHC) by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Bureau of PrimaryHealth Care [53, 54], ensuring federal funding and reimbursement for health services pro-vided by LGBT health clinics; and finally the inclusion of LGBT people collectively withinHealthy People 2020 [55]. In 2011, the IOM published a comprehensive report on LGBThealth entitled “The health of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people: Building afoundation for better understanding” [56]. In it, they synthesized decades of research onLGBT health in order to summarize what was known about the disproportionate burden ofdisease among LGBT people and areas for future research.Health issues recognized by the IOM report as pertinent to either all or particular sub-groups of LGBT people include: Anxiety; access and other barriers to quality care; depression;suicide and suicidal ideation; eating disorders; adolescent pregnancy; obesity; HIV and othersexually transmitted infections; breast cancer; anal cancer; cervical cancer; bullying and harass-ment; erectile dysfunction; substance abuse (including cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs);cardiovascular disease; and elevated rates of other cancers possibly associated with hormonetreatments for transgender individuals [57]. Each of these can be recognized as relevant healthconcerns for LGBT populations, but researchers and community members have questionedhow disproportionate health burdens could or should translate to concrete health service [5,57]. Although no clear consensus has been reached, LGBT community health centers havedeveloped LGBT health services that address the physical health, mental health, social, andeducational needs of the LGBT people.Guided by this review of the literature, we now turn to assess the scope of LGBT health ser-vices in the United States today. Publicly available data were analyzed and used to generate aUnited States LGBT community health center asset map. We then discuss how the LGBThealth movement has shaped the contemporary landscape of LGBT health services, currentgaps in service, and consider how social and political changes may influence the LGBT healthservice landscape moving forward.Contemporary landscape of LGBT health servicesMethodsDefinitions and criteria. To generate an asset map of the contemporary landscape ofLGBT health services, several key constructs required operationalization. Based upon findingsfrom the literature review, definitions and criteria for LGBT community centers and LGBTcommunity health centers were generated. These definitions and criteria ensured that all orga-nizations and service sites identified during data collection were appropriately categorizedand, if necessary, excluded from analyses. Definitions and criteria are included in Table 1.FQHCs are also included in Table 1 in order to contrast our own definition of and criteria forLGBT community health centers with the stringent criteria that must be met in order to berecognized federally as a community health center. Although FQHCs are able to provide muchmore comprehensive care than the LGBT community health centers we define here, manyLGBT community health centers operate in smaller capacities and provide a variety of healthservices to their local community members. For example, while only 14 of the more than 1,100federally-funded Community Health Centers focus on LGBT populations [58–60],LGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 6 / 18CenterLink, a coalition of 180 LGBT community organizations, identified at least 62 LGBTorganizations providing health services [7]. CenterLink publishes a biennual report on the sta-tus and service efforts of LGBT community organizations throughout the United States.Data collection. In 2014, CenterLink contacted 211 (member and non-member) LGBTcommunity organizations within the United States and Puerto Rico. Of those, 111 respondedto the agency’s online survey, representing 32 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.Responding organizations were predominantly independent entities, however, a few (13%)were affiliates of other organizations (e.g. local community health groups). Most organizationsoccupied a physical space, but 6% operated solely through phone or mobile van services only[7].Table 1.

These lists were not mutually exclusive, and not allrespondents to the biannual survey were CenterLink members, resulting in an initial list of 193organizations and service sites. We then searched public records for each organization usingGuideStar, a database of IRS-registered non-profit organizations, to confirm non-profit status.Any new organizations that was identified via the GuideStar search were added to the list.Additional organizations were also identified using the “Resources” (or similar topic) sectionof organizational websites. In the event that any of the criteria for LGBT community healthcenters was unavailable on an organizational website, organizations were contacted by tele-phone to confirm the missing data. Organizations that did not meet the criteria for LGBTcommunity centers, or for which the criteria could not be confirmed via online search or tele-phone call, were excluded. Data collection occurred between September–December, 2015. InJune, 2016, CenterLink published their 2016 LGBT Community Center Survey Report [8]. Tennew organizations were included that had not been otherwise identified, of which two met thecriteria for an LGBT community center. Neither met the criteria for an LGBT communityhealth center.LGBT health services were categorized according to CenterLink & Movement Advance-ment Project’s (MAP’s) 2014 findings [7]. These include: general medical services; pharmacyservices; STD/HIV services (i.e. prevention, testing, treatment, counseling, etc.); individual,group, couples, and family counseling; peer support groups; 12-step programs; psychiatric ser-vices; anti-violence programming; and wellness programs and services (e.g. healthy eating,active living, cancer support, and other healthy living programs and support groups). Addi-tional categories were created for organizations whose health services did not fit within theabove categories. These include: transgender care (specialized physical and mental health ser-vices for transgender patients), addiction services (syringe exchange and recovery programs),and health insurance enrollment programs. LGBT community centers that operated a physicalhealth clinic were also identified, and were defined as clinical spaces operated by trained andlicensed healthcare personnel. These include but are not limited to primary care clinics in thathealth clinics may specialize in specific services (e.g., testing and treatment of sexually trans-mitted infections) rather than offer the full service scope of primary care. Community healthcenters that offer health services in the absence of a trained and licensed professional (e.g., can-cer support groups, HIV prevention programs, 12-step programs) would not be qualify asoperating clinical spaces.In all, 435 records were created during the search for LGBT community health centers. Ofthese 435 records, 129 (29.7%) did not meet the criteria to be defined as an LGBT communitycenter (Fig 1). The remaining 306 LGBT community center service sites were operated by 219independent LGBT community centers. Of those, 213 (69.6%) were identified as LGBT com-munity health center service sites, which were operated by 147 independent LGBT communityhealth centers.Data analysis. Data previously compiled by the Williams Institute [62] in which censusdata was used to describe same-sex households per county in the United States [63] wereuploaded into Geographic Information System (GIS) ArcGIS Desktop software. Same-sexhouseholds, identified using 2010 census data, is used in this study as a proxy for local LGBTpopulation density. Using the GIS software, same-sex household data was joined to a Tiger/Line shapefile representing the geographic boundaries of United States counties. Doing soassociated United States counties within the electronic map shapefile with their relative num-ber of same-sex households. The county shapefile was then overlaid above a United States sha-pefile displaying the state and national boundaries of the United States. Next, county areasLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 8 / 18were filled by graduated colors representing the relative proportion of same-sex households toall households per county. These groups were defined according to the Esri version of Jenksnatural breaks classification, which “creates grouped classes according to clusters and gaps inthe data” [64, p. 134]. Finally, LGBT community health centers were geocoded, or linked to aspecific geographic location within the United States map, in order to display their locationrelative to the local same-sex population density. A 60-mile buffer was created around eachLGBT community health center to represent the geographic coverage area for each center. The60 miles radius was chosen to approximate a one-hour drive from each center.Centroid locations, or the most central point of each county polygon, were calculated usingArcGIS in order to determine approximate distances between each county center and its near-est LGBT community health center. The dataset was then exported to STATA 12.1 containingthe number of same-sex households by county and the distance from county center to thenearest LGBT community health center. Linear regression was run to determine whether thelocal LGBT population density was significantly associated with the distance to the nearestLGBT community health center.ResultsFig 2 displays the locations of all 213 LGBT community health centers in relation to LGBTpopulation density by county. Clusters of LGBT community health centers are located on bothFig 1.

Within the continental United States, no LGBT community health centerswere identified in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire,North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. As seen, LGBT community cen-ters are closely aligned with same-sex household population density (this association is statisti-cally significant as tested by a bivariate linear regression predicting the locations of LGBTcommunity health centers from the number of same-sex households by county, β = -0.00049,S.E. = 0.00015, p = 0.001).Figs 3 and 4 display the locations of LGBT community health centers that operate generalhealth clinics (Fig 3) and those whose health clinics offer transgender care services specifically(Fig 4).

Early efforts to protect LGBT people againstsocietal stigma and prejudice motivated LGBT communities to provide themselves with betterhealth services than they could not obtain in general population settings. In their earliest formthese health services consisted predominantly of general medical, mental health, and sexualhealth services at LGBT organizations operating small health clinics [5, 37, 38]. These organi-zations soon included such specialized services as hospice, grief counseling, cancer prevention,peer support groups, and 12-step programs in the era of HIV, the stigma from which left manywithout access to care in the general population healthcare settings [1, 2].LGBT health services have continued to evolve and expand in accordance with socialchange and medical advances. For example, hospice care services have presumably diminishedwithin LGBT community health centers as HIV-related morbidity and mortality decreased,while counseling services remain common and have expanded in the types of counseling ser-vices available. The expansion of services over time demonstrates that, whether offering highlytechnical and specialized medical care or preventative and wellness services, a majority ofLGBT community organizations have made health a priority. The high prevalence of wellnessservices suggests that even organizations with limited resources may be able to engage withhealth promotion and prevention efforts in their communities.This study highlights a number of challenges with regard to accessing LGBT health services.First, as Fig 2 demonstrates, while significant proportions of LGBT people living on eithercoast live within 60-miles of an LGBT community health center, the central states are largelyunder-served. Thirteen states are devoid of LGBT community health centers altogether. Andwhile we used a 60-mile radius as an indicator of proximity, even a 60-mile radius may notrepresent accessibility in the dense urban and coastal hubs. Moreover, proximity to any oneLGBT community health center does not necessarily mean access to comprehensive LGBThealth services given that each LGBT community health center provides a different combina-tion of health services.At the same time, we should not assume that a lack of LGBT community health centersequates to a lack of culturally competent health services. There are alternative venues whereLGBT people could access health services, such as women’s clinics or private practices, thatmay provide quality care to them. Similarly, although LGBT community health centers may bemore aware of and sensitive to the needs of clients with diverse gender and sexual identitiesthan general healthcare providers, this capacity for greater cultural competence does not nec-essarily extend across racial/ethnic groups, socioeconomic diversity, and immigration status.Black LGBT people, for example may still feel a lack of competency from, or a level of discom-fort with, LGBT-specific providers who are not Black themselves [10].The purpose of this study is not to definitively determine all the places LGBT people canand do access culturally competent care. With that said, our own findings suggest that Center-Link and MAP have likely greatly under-reported the number of LGBT people served in 2015,as their estimate of 300,000 people served is based upon data reported by only 62 organizations[8]. LGBT community health centers continue to be a valuable resource to LGBT people, andhow these resources are invested in going forward is a matter of great concern.LimitationsThe research conducted as a part of this study is limited in a few ways. First, we cannot claimto represent all LGBT community health centers. Although we had criteria for defining andcategorized organizations during data collection, there was nonetheless room for error. Infor-mation available online was assumed to be accurate, particularly including informationLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 12 / 18regarding the services provided. However, if an organization had recently added or removedservices without updating the website than their classification as an LGBT health center (ornot) may be inaccurate. Also, our findings represent an overall snapshot of the LGBT commu-nity health centers and services provided between September–December of 2015. The natureof studying or working with community-based organizations requires some allowances forimperfections in the data collected. One consequence of being a small, new, or under-resourced LGBT community health center–as many of the organizations included in our studyare [8]–is that the services they provide may change over time or even cease to exist. This maybe the result of organizations merging together, shifting the services provided according to thedemands, the availability of new funding opportunities, the withdrawal of funding, andchanges in personnel. Finally, our findings only describe the availability of services offered byLGBT community health centers, not on the quality of services or even the extent to which anyservices are utilized. Our goal here was to discuss the broader scope of what LGBT health ser-vices look like today, and we believe we have achieved that goal.This study is also limited in its ability to speak to the wide diversity of LGBT experiences.For example, the literature review contains several significant gaps with respect to the uniqueroles and experiences of LGBT racial/ethnic minorities, bisexuals, and transgender peoplewithin the LGBT health movement. Although people whose identities lie within each of thesecategories undoubtedly played important roles in the broader “LGBT” movement, their storiesmay often be subsumed under, or even appropriated by, the largely White, middle-class, gaynarratives dominating the literature [32, 65]. The present study cannot speak to the involve-ment of these populations in the LGBT health movement in the absence of literature on thesubject. Similarly, without assessments of the origins, evolution, and contemporary landscapeof LGBT health movements internationally, it is not possible to situate these findings withinthe broader story of LGBT people globally. We hope that our research encourages future stud-ies to explore the wide diversity of LGBT people and their experiences within health move-ments in different regions of the world and over time.Finally, the census data representing LGBT population density do not adequately representthe actual size of local LGBT populations or its diversity. One reason being that not all LGBTpeople have or live with their partners, and another being that not all would feel comfortableidentifying themselves as living in a same-sex household. But this approach also fails to capturebisexual and transgender people in opposite-sex households. These numerous limitations todetermining the geographic distribution of LGBT people, and particularly bisexual and trans-gender people, in turn limit the study’s ability to fully assess the distribution of LGBT healthservices. For example, it may be that bisexual and transgender people are more highly concen-trated in distinct areas from lesbians and gay men, but that those communities are not visiblewithin the census data. In spite of these limitations, this approach using census data remains auseful metric for determining where LGBT people may be more highly concentrated. With nonational census data on sexual orientation of individuals, this is the most comprehensivenational data currently available for estimating the geographic distribution of the LGBTpeople.ConclusionAs acceptance of LGBT people increases [66, 67], the need for specialized services maydecrease. However, it remains unclear what the path forward will be for LGBT communityhealth centers. It is possible that there will always be a need for LGBT-specific health servicesno matter what the level of social acceptance becomes. In this case, we may see continuation ofthe increase in the numbers of LGBT health centers, their spread into parts of the countryLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 13 / 18where they are now absent, and greater sophistication of their services regarding the needs ofdiverse subgroups of the LGBT population (e.g. young Black gay men, older Latina lesbians).But it is also possible that we will see a reduction or consolidation of LGBT health servicesas LGBT people find comparable services at general, not LGBT-specific, clinics. Koester andcolleagues [9] explored this among gay and bisexual men, concluding that gay and bisexualmen may come to prefer having both LGBT-specific and general population healthcare ser-vices available to them, but would utilize particular kinds of services in each setting. For exam-ple, young, HIV-negative gay and bisexual men reported a preference for separating sexualhealth services, which they sought in LGBT-specific centers, and other general health services,which they sought in general population settings. In this case of segmented care, LGBT com-munity health centers would need to grow their understanding of LGBT peoples’ healthcarepreferences in order to provide highly tailored services when comprehensive care is not anorganizational option.LGBT people may also eventually choose healthcare settings where all their healthcareneeds can be consolidated. Differences in sexual orientation disclosure rates to healthcare pro-viders between rural and urban settings suggests that LGBT people may feel more comfortablewith general population healthcare providers in urban settings [68]. A shift away from LGBTcommunity health centers may then begin in urban centers, where there is greater acceptanceof LGBT people, and would suggest a greater need for LGBT organizations to re-direct servicestoward rural areas, where LGBT people are more likely to be shunned, or for services, supportand consultation to be made available online or via telephone in order to accommodate theneeds of those outside of urban centers. Also, to the extent that younger people would becomeless likely to identify LGBT labels [69, 70], traditional LGBT organizations may struggle toappeal to future generations. Future studies on LGBT healthcare should consider preferencesfor venue, provider, and services, as well as overall satisfaction, access and utilization acrossLGBT sub-populations (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity, age cohort) and geographicregion.Additionally, preferences for consolidated services may lead LGBT community health cen-ters to much more closely resemble (or ultimately gain recognition as) FQHCs in order to pro-vide consolidated care and attract a greater client base. This may be particularly true in ruralsettings, as FQHCs have demonstrated a history of providing quality care to socially and medi-cally disadvantaged patients [71, 72]. LGBT community health centers have increasingly beenrecognized as FQHCs over the past 15 years, through a number of dramatic shifts in political,social, and health care system landscapes. Although it is difficult to assess how, for example,the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (United States healthcare legislation passed in2010 that increased access to health insurance for citizens beginning in 2014) influenced theLGBT health service landscape during the period of data collection for the present study, it isnotable that LGBT community health centers began gaining recognition as FQHCs longbefore, and throughout, its implementation. Furthermore, with only 14 of the LGBT commu-nity health centers recognized as FQHCs, and their long history in the United States, it is safeto assume that they will remain prominent in the LGBT healthcare landscape for many yearsto come.The LGBT health movement has generated over 200 LGBT community health centers pro-viding services to LGBT people throughout the United States. Although many states and com-munities remain un- or under-served, it is clear that the LGBT health movement has growngreatly since its earliest manifestations in the 1950s to serve the health needs of LGBT peoplein the United States. With many social and political changes in the U.S., the long-term futureof LGBT health services is uncertain. It is vital that researchers explore the forces that shapehealth care provision for LGBT people and how the immensely diverse populations of LGBTLGBT health servicesPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180544 July 10, 2017 14 / 18people will choose to access these services. The LGBT health movement has a complex task ofworking toward the dual goals of better tailoring LGBT health services to the needs of LGBTpeople as well as ensuring that they all have access to health services within safe spaces.Supporting informationS1 File.

    "abstract": "LGBT community health centers have been a major provider of health services to LGBT people in the U.S., but there are significant gaps in the types of services offered by centers across the country.This study identified 213 LGBT community health centers operating in 37 states. No LGBT community health centers were operating in eleven states primarily clustered in the central U.S. (Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming), Alaska, or Hawaii.Most LGBT community health centers provide wellness programs and services (72%), HIV/STI services (65%), and counseling services (52%). Among the services least available across health centers are transgender care services (10%), pharmacy services (8%), and psychiatric services (3%)",
