We reviewed evidence and developed programme theories to explain which universal interventions work, for whom, in which contexts and why. We conducted a rapid realist review and extracted data in context–mechanism–outcome configurations, to develop and refine programme theories. We included 53 sources and identified five intervention themes: student pride clubs, inclusive antibullying and harassment policies, inclusive curricula, workshops and staff training. Here, we show that these interventions could work by reducing discrimination, bullying and marginalization. Interventions appear to work best when school staff are trained and the school climate is supportive and may be less effective for boys, gender minority students and bisexual students. Our findings provide guiding principles for schools to develop interventions and should encourage primary research to confirm, refute or refine our programme theories.Depression and anxiety are common mental health problems, which often begin during adolescence1,2. Self-harm is frequently comorbid with adolescent depression and anxiety and these mental health prob-lems are leading risk factors for suicide3,4. There is evidence that rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide are rising among young people1,5,6. Public health interventions to prevent these mental health problems would reduce their rising incidence and alleviate the burden on clinical services.Sexual and gender minorities (SGM, people who are not hetero-sexual or cisgender) are often exposed to stigma, prejudice, discrimina-tion and abuse within societies that promote being heterosexual and cisgender as normal7–9. Minority stress theory proposes that stigma, prejudice and discrimination create a hostile and stressful environment that causes mental health problems among sexual and gender minori-ties. Sexual minority young people (including but not limited to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or queer) are twice as likely to experience depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality than their heterosexual peers10–12. There are few high-quality population-based studies of men-tal health among gender minority (including but not limited to those who are transgender, non-binary and gender diverse) compared with cisgender young people13,14. However, there is evidence that gender minority young people are at increased risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality15–19.Universal interventions aim to reduce exposure to modifiable causal risk factors and have succeeded at preventing heart disease and certain cancers20,21.

We also included 6 reviews and, following realist guidelines, 1 non-peer-reviewed source.Sources were published between 1995 and 2021 and 65% were con-ducted in North America (Table 1). Thirteen included data on mental health outcomes (Supplementary Table 5). Study characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 4.We classified interventions into five themes (Supplementary Table 6): gay–straight alliances (GSAs) and similar student clubs (for example, pride clubs); inclusive antibullying and harassment policies; inclusive curricula; workshops including media-based interventions and LGBTQ+ ally training.Our initial programme theory proposed that strategies to promote inclusivity and acceptance for SGM young people in schools would reduce their risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality. This was generally supported within each of our themes. We present refined programme theories for each theme separately (Table 2 and Figs. 2–5). Some themes had multiple programme theories, to represent distinct outcomes or mechanisms. Each theme includes additional information around contexts, mechanisms and potential harms. Where a CMO was raised by or strongly supported by the Young Person’s Advisory Group (YPAG) or Stakeholder’s Advisory Group (SAG), we reference ‘YPAG’ or ‘SAG.’ Individual CMOs and references for each section are provided in Supplementary Tables 7–11. Detailed information on the development of the programme theories can be found in the Methods.Gay–straight alliances and similar student clubsProgramme theories. When SGM students attend schools with GSAs or similar clubs (C), they may experience reductions in bullying and discrimination (O) (Fig. 2). This could be because these clubs reduce homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, improve relationships between students, empower SGMs to speak out, validate being les-bian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ+) and improve school climate (M) (SAG)32–38.When SGM students attend schools with GSAs or similar clubs (C), they report reductions in suicidal thoughts and attempts, improve-ments in academic performance, increased school attendance, reduc-tions in isolation and increased feelings of safety (O). This could be because of reductions in bullying and increases in social support and connectedness, due to safe spaces where students make friends, vali-date their thoughts and feelings, do not feel judged and build positive relationships with school staff (M) (SAG and YPAG)32–35,37–40.Additional information on mechanisms. When teachers who identify as sexual or gender minorities also attend GSAs and similar clubs, it may enhance their positive impact because students are exposed to role models who they can turn to for support (SAG and YPAG)39. Staff can communicate their support by attending GSAs or wearing rainbow lanyards (YPAG). The longer-established the GSA or similar club, the more likely it is to be effective35,36. It is also important that GSAs and similar clubs are taken as seriously as other clubs (YPAG).Key contexts and groups. Young people who are still coming to terms with their sexual orientation or gender may not attend GSAs or similar clubs. However, the presence of a GSA or similar club could be more important than participating in it, perhaps because the activi-ties benefit the whole school32. Setting up a successful GSA might depend on school climate including openness amongst students and staff, a whole-school ‘inclusivity’ approach as well as tailoring for the school’s demographics and ethos (SAG). Resistance and ignorance from parents, conservatism in families, lack of confidence or skills in teachers as well as single-sex boys’ schools can be barriers to success-fully implementing GSAs (SAG). One study found that although GSAs reduced bullying and improved feelings of safety, there was no reduc-tion in depressive symptoms32. Reasons for this finding were unclear.prevention of mental health problems20 but their development con-tinues to lag behind those for physical health. Schools are a potential setting for preventative interventions that would reach most young people. There is evidence that, in schools, SGM young people experi-ence higher levels of bullying, discrimination, exclusion and margin-alization than their heterosexual or cisgender peers10,22–25. Universal interventions which promote inclusivity and acceptance of diverse sexual and gender identities in schools could prevent or reduce mental health problems among SGM young people.To our knowledge, no study has synthesized evidence on universal school-based interventions to promote inclusivity and acceptance of diverse sexual and gender identities. In addition to identifying inter-ventions, it is important to investigate which work, in what context, for whom and how to inform effective implementation. The effective-ness of interventions might depend on the contexts in which they are implemented. For example, some interventions might work better in schools with already high acceptance and inclusivity while being potentially harmful in schools with lower acceptance and inclusivity. Similarly, interventions might increase acceptance and inclusivity towards sexual but not gender minorities.Realist reviews use context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) con-figurations to generate programme theories, which suggest that cer-tain interventions are more or less likely to work, for certain people, in certain situations26. The aim is to develop, refine and test theo-ries about how interventions interact with contexts (C, people and environments), by triggering mechanisms (M, internal psychoso-cial reactions and reasonings) to generate outcomes (O)26,27. Realist approaches to evidence synthesis can be used to complement sys-tematic reviews and meta-analyses, by providing evidence beyond effectiveness28,29.Rapid realist reviews enable evidence to be produced in a timely and resource-sensitive manner for policy decision-making26. Compared to traditional realist reviews, rapid realist reviews do not aim to conduct comprehensive literature searches of peer-reviewed literature and other sources. Instead, they draw more heavily on input from refer-ence groups and include experts in research and practice to develop programme theories, accelerate the reviewing process and advise on the dissemination and use of findings26. The rapid realist methodol-ogy has previously been used to provide timely evidence in a range of areas, including school-based interventions and healthcare27,28,30. We conducted a rapid realist review to investigate the following questions: (1) What universal school-based interventions exist to promote in-clusivity and acceptance of diverse sexual and gender identities and how and where were they implemented? (2) In which contexts, and for whom, do these interventions work (or not work) and why?ResultsWe identified 5,155 records from database searches and 16 through other sources including the call for evidence, websites and reference checking (Fig. 1). We screened 407 full texts and included 53 eligible sources (Fig. 1): 52 peer reviewed and one other source31. All included sources were relevant to the development of the programme theories. The rigour of sources was mixed: the methods of 22 of 53 sources were deemed trustworthy and credible, that is the data collected allowed the study to address the research question and the authors’ interpretation of the results was substantiated by their data (Supplementary Table 3). Twelve sources did not fulfil either of these criteria and the remaining 19 sources were somewhat trustworthy and credible or the rigour of sources was considered unclear. Detailed information on the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria and quality assessment can be found in the Methods.Of the peer-reviewed papers, 6 used mixed methods, 14 were qualitative and 25 were quantitative. Of the quantitative studies, 17 were cross-sectional, 5 used prepost comparison designs, Nature Human BehaviourArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01521-zPotential for harm. If the wider school environment is not supportive, GSAs or similar clubs could increase bullying because the visibility of SGM students is increased39,41. SGM students might be reluctant to attend GSAs or similar clubs if they fear being stigmatized and bul-lied for attending them (SAG and YPAG). This might particularly be the case in rural settings41. Members of GSAs or similar clubs, might also become isolated from the wider school community (YPAG). The wider school context could be addressed and the climate of a school assessed first, to determine what type of intervention might be most effective (YPAG and SAG). Our SAG also suggested that, beyond the wider environment, if a GSA is not run well then it might not be a safe space for all members (SAG).Inclusive antibullying and harassment policiesProgramme theories. When SGM students attend schools with inclusive antibullying and harassment policies, and staff are aware of these policies and implement them (C), students feel safer, have higher self-esteem and are less likely to experience self-harm, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and absenteeism (O) (Fig. 3). This could be because of reduced bullying and homophobic aggression42,43 and a more supportive school culture, with staff and students likely to intervene (M)34,35,38,42–47.When school staff implement inclusive policies in rural or politi-cally conservative communities, with religious groups that oppose equal rights (C), they may face barriers such as unsupportive school leadership, patriarchal values and hetero- and cis-normativity (O), due to lack of systemic changes to attitudes (M)48–50.When inclusive antibullying policies address homophobic lan-guage within broader conversations about social status, popularity and masculinity (C), this is more likely to reduce homophobic slurs (O). This could be because heterosexual students often do not see themselves as homophobic but understand ideas about popularity and masculinity (M)51.Additional information on mechanisms and strategies. It is impor-tant that policies are supported by school leaders and the imple-mentation of policies is monitored.

It is possible that lesbian and gay but not bisexual or gender minority (bi SGM) students are at reduced risk of bullying and suicide attempts in schools with inclusive antibully-ing policies compared to those without44. This might be because risk factors are different among bi SGM, compared with gay and lesbian young people43,44. The positive effects of inclusive school policies might be less persistent among boys/young men than girls/young women52. It seems necessary that the school policy is an LGBTQ+ inclu-sive one, not just a general one, as these do not reduce bullying among SGM students44.Potential for harms. Gender equity government legislation aims to address gender inequity in schools. When gender equity policies are implemented in schools that are hostile to sexual and gender minori-ties, these students might experience increases in bullying or isola-tion49. Students might gain a false sense of safety and face backlash when being ‘out’ about their sexuality or gender53. Our YPAG proposed conflict resolution talks to address bullying instead of punishments such as detention, which do not educate the perpetrators. They also suggested that safeguarding issues should be evaluated to respect the privacy of SGM students (YPAG) when reporting incidents. Information about students’ sexual or gender identity should not be revealed to parents/carers (YPAG)53.Inclusive curriculaProgramme theories. When schools have inclusive curricula, with positive representation of SGMs (C), SGM students are less likely to be bullied and other students are more likely to intervene (O1) (Fig. 4). This can improve connectedness (O2) as well as self-esteem and well-being and reduce suicidal ideation among SGM students (O3). This could be because inclusive curricula increase awareness, under-standing and acceptance (M1), validate sexual and gender minorities (M2), oppose compulsory heterosexuality (M3) and improve school climate (M4)31,33,39,54–66.Additional information on mechanisms and strategies. Inclusive curricula seem most effective when they: avoid ‘deficit and at-risk narratives’, make the contributions and achievements of LGBTQ+ role models visible, use workbooks and literature that include LGBTQ+ issues, facilitate indepth reflection on LGBTQ+ topics beyond learning facts, have sticker systems to highlight books with LGBTQ+ themes and/or characters, include LGBTQ+ topics in sexual health education and are implemented from an early age onwards (SAG and YPAG)39,54–61. Inclusive curricula should be codesigned and codelivered by teachers and LGBTQ+ students (SAG). Our YPAG stated that students should be better educated on the history of LGBTQ+ people, for example the lesbian community providing activism and support during the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s. Our SAG suggested that exter-nal speakers such as mental health professional and human rights activists can provide additional insights into the challenges LGBTQ+ people experience.Key contexts and groups. Inclusive curricula seem particularly effec-tive for students who are severely victimized on the basis of gender expression or in schools with hostile climates33,60. Not all studies found reductions in bullying and victimization after implementing inclusive curricula31,59. While it is unclear what the mechanisms of these differ-ential effects are, it might be due to school climates and ingredients of curricula.Potential for harms. When inclusive curricula face a backlash from the wider community, they might lead to increased bullying of SGM students50. Our SAG suggested that schools might face pushback from parents who are opposed to inclusive curricula. If teachers are not well-informed on LGBTQ+ issues, they might not address topics sen-sitively and use incorrect language and/or pronouns (SAG and YPAG). They might fear unintentionally causing offence (SAG).Workshops including media interventionsProgramme theories. When students attend workshops on sexual and gender diversity, led by sexual and gender minorities or assemblies or media interventions led by SGM students (C), this increases inclusiv-ity and acceptance, decreases bullying and increases the likelihood of students intervening (O) (Fig. 5). This could be because workshops increase students’ understanding and acceptance, promote empa-thy and raise awareness of the harmful effects of discrimination (M) (YPAG)62–67.Additional information on mechanisms and strategies. Peer educa-tors with lived experience seem to play an important role in increasing inclusivity and acceptance and reducing bullying62,64,65. Interven-tions might be particularly effective if they provide information on how to be an ally and how to behave when witnessing bullying and harassment66. Young students might especially benefit from work-shops and media interventions, as this can foster acceptance and inclusion from a young age (SAG). However, one study in the Neth-erlands found mixed effects of a peer intervention on attitudes and bullying among male students. This might be due to the content of the intervention, the school context and/or the age of students68. Workshops should not be tokenistic (for example, occurring during pride month but not thereafter) and should be part of a meaning-ful, long-term commitment including different school interventions (SAG and YPAG).Potential for harms. In a study conducted in the Netherlands, there was some evidence that positive attitudes towards SGM students and willingness to intervene declined after a peer-led intervention, particu-larly among male students. This could have been due to the content and nature of the intervention as well as the school context68.Table 1 | Summary of studies (n = 53)Study setting Study designCountry Number of studiesDesign Number of studiesUnited States 27 Quantitative cross-sectional studies17Canada 7 Quantitative non-randomized trials/cohort studies2Australia 5 Quantitative observational studies with prepost comparator only5England 2 RCT 1South Africa 2 Qualitative 14New Zealand 2 Mixed methods 6the Netherlands 2 Systematic review 4Italy 1 Other review 2Taiwan 1 Other 2Philippines 1Norway 1Israel 1Republic of Ireland 1Nature Human BehaviourArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01521-zLGBTQ+ ally and staff trainingProgramme theories. When teachers and school staff are well-informed about sexuality and gender issues (C), SGM students experience less victimization, greater self-esteem, improved men-tal health, fewer days of school absence and higher attainment (O) (Fig. 6). This could be because staff are better equipped to create safe spaces, support GSAs and inclusive curricula and refer students to community and counselling support (M1). Students are also likely to build connections and feel accepted within a safe and progressive environment where gender binary norms are challenged and staff use correct pronouns (M2)33,56,69–71.When teachers receive training in how to be an ally, which pro-vides them with information about language and behaviour (C), SGM students feel safer and less victimized (O). This could be because teach-ers and students are more likely to discuss, respond to and intervene against such behaviour (M)41,69–74.Additional information on mechanisms and strategies. One of the barriers to school staff supporting SGM students is insufficient train-ing and resources, including lack of knowledge about pronouns (SAG and YPAG)70. Teachers might be more likely to discuss homophobic language in class but not more likely to intervene after a training course, if not sufficiently prepared to do so72. Training on LGBTQ+ topics might be particularly effective if codesigned and codelivered by teachers and LGBTQ+ students (SAG and YPAG).DiscussionWe identified five types of universal intervention designed to promote inclusivity and acceptance of diverse sexual and gender identities in secondary schools. Interventions included GSAs or similar student clubs (for example, pride clubs), LGBTQ+ inclusive antibullying and harassment policies, LGBTQ+ inclusive curricula, workshops includ-ing media-based interventions and LGBTQ+ ally and staff training. We produced a conceptual framework (programme theory) to explain how these interventions might work, for whom, in which contexts and why. Our findings supported our initial programme theory, which proposed that improving inclusivity and acceptance for SGM young people in schools would reduce their risks of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality. Our findings further elucidated the role of specific con-texts and mechanisms underlying the potential impact of universal school-based interventions.Several studies found evidence that GSAs or similar student clubs were associated with reductions in bullying and improvements in mental health among students.

The potential benefits of GSAs or similar student clubs might depend upon the pre-existing school climate. These clubs are likely to make SGM students more visible, which could increase their exposure to bullying and discrimination. It is therefore possible that GSAs and similar clubs tend to be implemented, and continued longer-term, in schools with more positive climates. The school climate emerged as particularly important in our review. School climate is shaped by norms, beliefs, relationships (within the school and with the community), teaching and learning practices and the organizational and physical features of the school74. As school-level approaches, inclusive curricula and antibullying and harassment poli-cies might be more effective at changing the school climate than GSAs or similar student clubs. However, these three approaches to interven-tion seem complementary.Inclusive antibullying and harassment policies may be less effec-tive for bi SGM than for lesbian or gay students. These policies may need to be adapted so they are effective for these young people. The existence of inclusive antibullying and harassment policies may not be sufficient to reduce discrimination and harassment towards SGM students. Implementation seems to depend upon the awareness of teaching staff and the active support of school leaders and the wider community. Inclusive antibullying and harassment policies could work best when there is education and support for bullies (for example, restorative justice) and a combination of multiple policies, particularly in the least safe schools.Inclusive curricula seem to work best when there is implementa-tion at an early age and positive representation of the achievements and contributions of SGM role models. Inclusive curricula could avoid focusing on ‘deficit and at-risk’ narratives and validate sexual and gen-der minorities as being equal to heterosexual and cisgender people.

For example, workshops and media interventions might be more effective when they are led by people who are SGMs. This could increase empathy, awareness and understanding and lead to increased inclusivity and acceptance.It might be harder to reduce homophobia, biphobia and transpho-bia among boys and young men compared with girls and young women. This is perhaps consistent with evidence that women are less likely to hold negative attitudes towards sexual minorities than are men75. Universal interventions in schools could be adapted for boys to focus less on the terms homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and, instead, challenge issues of masculinity and popularity.Our literature search was systematic but, consistent with recom-mendations for rapid realist reviews, we did not aim to capture all studies exhaustively26. We assessed the rigour and relevance of each source to our programme theories, which were the main outputs of our investigation. Our programme theories were informed, refined and endorsed by experts by lived experience, including young people, teachers, policy representatives and school governors. This should improve the validity and generalizability of our theories and the rel-evance and feasibility of our recommendations for policy and practice.Although our initial programme theory was generally supported, few studies reported data on depression and anxiety. Several studies reported data on self-harm and suicidality. Interventions that reduce the risk of self-harm and suicidality could also be associated with reduc-tions in depression and anxiety, but more research on this is needed.Most studies were conducted in North America or Australia. Find-ings from these countries are unlikely to generalize to other settings, particularly low- and middle-income countries. Few studies were large enough to meaningfully distinguish between SGM groups. We also found little evidence on whether the effectiveness of interventions varied according to factors such as age, ethnicity or symptom severity. While all included sources were relevant to the development of our programme theories, only 22 of 53 sources described methods that were considered trustworthy and credible. We found only one RCT59.The school climate emerged as particularly important for the implementation and potential impact of universal school-based inter-ventions. Implementing multiple universal approaches could maximize the possibility of changing the school climate and improving outcomes for students. The order in which interventions are implemented could also be considered. Inclusive curricula and antibullying and harass-ment policies could be implemented before GSAs or similar clubs. This would demonstrate that the school promotes inclusive and accepting attitudes towards SGMs and does not tolerate bullying based on these Context:in which context and for whomthe intervention works bestMechanisms:why the intervention worksIncreasing empathy and understandingLGBTQ+ peer educatorsby LGBTQ+ students(1) Workshops held by(2) Media intervention led(1) Sexual minorities(2) Gender minoritiesIncrease in inclusivity andacceptanceDecrease in homophobicand transphobic bullyingRaising awareness of discriminationOutcomesFig. 5 | Programme theory for workshops including media interventions.

The clubs would therefore be supported by a wider movement within the school, at the policy level, with the support of senior leadership. It seems important that all school staff are made aware of these school policies and implement them, and that there are processes for reporting homophobic/biphobic/transphobic incidents.Universal interventions including inclusive curricula, staff training and workshops should be codeveloped and delivered by SGM students, staff, experts by lived experience and peer educators. Schools should promote the positive representation of diverse sexual and gender identities at an early age through inclusive curricula and SGM teachers and school staff attending GSAs and similar clubs.The implementation and effectiveness of all interventions is likely to depend on how well-trained teaching and school staff are. Sufficient teacher training and resources could be provided so that teachers and school staff are educated to be aware of, and feel confident at challeng-ing, slurs and bullying. School staff might then be better equipped to implement interventions, provide support and be inclusive towards SGM students. This could lead to increased acceptance, support and safer learning environments. In turn, this could reduce bullying and improve mental health for SGM students.Further research should include RCTs that examine the effective-ness of interventions. Studies should also systematically evaluate the implementation and impact of specific aspects of interventions to elucidate the contexts and mechanisms of successful interven-tions. Further evidence is needed on the potential impact of universal school-based interventions on mental health outcomes among gender minority young people and different sexual minority students, com-paring lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer students. The effectiveness of interventions according to demographic factors, such as gender, ethnicity, religion and disability, of students should be explored. Our findings provide guiding principles for schools to develop and imple-ment universal interventions, which could improve inclusivity and acceptance for SGM students and reduce their risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality. Our programme theories highlight the importance of the following factors: the overall school climate, including support by school staff and parents, positive representa-tion of SGMs, teacher training and coproduction and codelivery of interventions by SGM students, staff and other experts by lived experi-ence from the wider community. In line with the realist approach, our findings encourage primary research to confirm, refute and refine our theories28.MethodsWe used the steps outlined in ref. 26: (1) Developed the scope by clarifying the content area (2) Defined the research questions and ensured there was enough evidence to answer them (3) Identified how findings and recommendations would be used (4) Developed search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria (5) Identified and screened peer-reviewed papers and  data from other sources including websites and grey  literature (6) Extracted and synthesized data (7) Validated findings with experts by lived experience (see below) to draw inferences and make hypotheses.We followed RAMESES guidelines for realist reviews (Supplemen-tary Table 1)76.Consultation with experts and reference groupsThe review process was guided by a reference group which consisted of a YPAG, a SAG and experts in the field of SGM mental health practice and research. Reference groups and experts help identify relevant sources and fill gaps in programme theories, ensuring the quality of the rapidly produced evidence26,27. They further advise on the dissemination and use of findings. The reference group provided information on the rel-evance and applicability of findings. Full insights from the reference groups are presented in the Supplementary Information.Young Person’s Advisory GroupThe YPAG consisted of eight sexual and/or gender minority young people (aged 14 to 24 years) including those with lived experience of mental health problems. Young people were recruited through the McPin Foundation’s Young People’s Network, a leading charity plac-ing lived experience at the heart of mental health research. One YPAG member joined our research team and worked on the literature search, data extraction and synthesis. We held three 1.5 h long involvement meetings. Meeting one focused on identifying the content area and defining the research question (steps 1 and 2). The YPAG also advised on search terms and suggested relevant organizations to identify grey literature (steps 4 and 5). Meeting two focused on interpreting preliminary findings and how they could be used in practice (steps 3 and 7). Meeting three focused on validating findings to refine Context:in which context and for whomthe intervention works bestMechanisms:why the intervention works Outcomeshomophobic languageuse and bullyingresourcesdelivered by LGBTQ+sta and students(1) Training on discussing(2) Suicient training and(3) Co designed and co(1) Sexual minorities(2) Gender minoritiesEquipping sta to implement interventionsand be supportive towards LGBTQ+ studentsIncreasing acceptance, support, treatment,connection and safe learning environmentsIncreasing likelihood of discussing, respondingto and intervening with homophobic languageuse and bullyingDecrease in victimizationIncrease in self-esteem,well-being and mentalhealthIncrease in feelings of safetyDecrease in victimizationFig. 6 | Programme theory for LGBTQ+ ally and staff training.

The YPAG group also advised on the dis-semination of findings in the form of a tool kit for schools.Stakeholder’s Advisory GroupThe SAG represented knowledge users and comprised a secondary school governor, a secondary school teacher and two members of the UK government Department for Education. The SAG advised on what currently happens in schools and what would be useful and feasible. We held two meetings to work on steps 1 and 2 and validated findings via email to refine programme theories (steps 3 and 7).Experts in SGM mental health research and practiceOur author team consisted of experts by experience (n = 3), research (n = 2) and clinical practice (n = 1). This ensured the consistency of findings with previous literature26.Search strategyWe conducted an exploratory scoping search using Google Scholar to identify key sources and reviews and develop an initial programme theory. For the main search, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science on 14 September 2021. Search terms related to sexual and gen-der identity (LGBTQ+ OR LGBT* OR LGB* OR queer OR sexual identit* OR sexual orientation OR gender identit* OR lesbian OR gay OR bisexual OR transgender OR nonbinary OR non-binary OR asexual OR pansexual OR sexualit* OR intersex OR omnisexual OR ‘questioning sexuality’ OR ‘questioning gender’ OR demisexual OR aromantic) and intervention type (school OR school-based OR educat* AND intervent* OR program* OR polic* OR curricul*). Sexual and gender identity and intervention search terms were combined with the Boolean operator AND (searches for each of the databases in Supplementary Table 11). We restricted the search to titles and abstracts. We consulted experts, the YPAG and relevant organizations to identify grey literature. A call for evidence was disseminated via Twitter to invite schools, organizations and young people to submit evidence.Inclusion and exclusion criteriaWe included any study design as well as non-peer-reviewed reports posted on websites of relevant LGBTQ+ organizations. There were no restrictions in publication dates but only sources in English were included. We excluded sources that did not provide enough detail to contribute to the development of programme theories.ParticipantsWe included sources relating to any sexual and gender identity, includ-ing SGM, that is people who are not heterosexual or cisgender, hetero-sexual and cisgender students who were aged 11–18 years and attending secondary school. We also included sources of secondary school teach-ing staff. We were primarily interested in universal interventions aimed at all students and teaching staff. We included interventions aimed solely at students or staff. If a source included students under age 11 or above age 18 years, we reviewed its contribution to the programme theory to determine inclusion.Main outcome(s)We included: depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidality. We also included measures of inclusivity and acceptance: bullying, school climate, school connectedness, stigma, prejudice and discrimination.Study selectionWe imported records into Rayyan and removed duplicates. Titles and abstracts were split and screened by two researchers (M.S. and T.S.). A 10% random sample was reviewed independently by a third researcher (T.W.). Full texts were split and screened by five researchers. A 10% ran-dom sample was reviewed independently by a third researcher (A.P.). Disagreements were resolved by consensus or after discussion with the lead researcher (G. Lewis). Reasons for exclusion were recorded, acknowledging that some records might have multiple reasons for exclusion.Data extractionWe used a data extraction schedule to extract: study aim(s) and design, intervention type, sample characteristics and size, context, mecha-nisms, outcomes and CMO configurations. Contexts comprised information on school setting, intervention type and target group, which may impact outcomes investigated by a source. We identified mechanisms from the quantitative or qualitative analyses that were conducted by the authors of each source, for example through exami-nation of mediator variables or qualitative themes or indirectly in the discussion sections of each source. CMOs were formulated on the basis of the findings presented by the authors of each source or identified by the reviewing team who linked findings with information from the introduction and discussion of each source.Data synthesisWe developed an initial programme theory on the basis of key sources from our exploratory scoping search, literature on minority stress theory and discussions with our reference group76. We refined the programme theory on the basis of the extracted CMOs from published sources and studies, as well as feedback from the reference group. We grouped the evidence into intervention categories which were informed by our experts, reference groups and literature. The intervention cat-egories were refined throughout the synthesis, to ensure their relevance and applicability. Within each intervention category, CMOs were syn-thesized on the basis of similar context and mechanism associations, which were linked to outcomes. The reference group identified gaps in these programme theories and highlighted which findings resonated with their lived experience or work. They also provided feedback on the feasibility, implementation and likely effectiveness of interventions. This information was used to expand on contexts and mechanisms.Quality assessmentRealist review methodology does not usually recommend a formal quality assessment and focuses instead on the rigour and relevance of sources to the programme theory26. During the extraction phase, we assessed each source in terms of whether the evidence contributed to theory development and excluded sources which did not provide suf-ficient information to extract CMOs. The rigour of sources was assessed on the basis of the credibility and trustworthiness of the methods76. To explore rigour, we extracted information on the study design, whether the methodological approach and data collected allowed the study to address the research question within the target population and whether the interpretation of results was sufficiently substantiated by the data (Supplementary Table 3). We also extracted information on the sample size, sampling strategy and adjustment for confounders whilst acknowledging that methodologically weak sources can still provide relevant information for the refinement of programme theories within realist methodologies29.PreregistrationWe preregistered our protocol with the prospective register of sys-tematic reviews, PROSPERO: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=279193. No changes were made to the protocol or reviewing process after registration.Inclusion and ethics statementThe review was conducted by academic and lived-experience research-ers in the field of SGM mental health. Responsibilities of co-authors were agreed collaboratively ahead of the review. The review draws upon national and international evidence and input from our reference group. No ethical approval was required.Nature Human BehaviourArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01521-zReporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Port-folio Reporting Summary linked to this article.Data availabilityThe data supporting the findings of this study are openly available in the individual sources which constitute the review. Data from the synthesis are available within the review and Supplementary Tables 1–3. Any further details required are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Submission to a public repository is not applicable. We conducted an exploratory scoping search using Google Scholar to identify key sources and reviews and develop an initial programme theory. For the main search, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science (search terms in Supplementary Table 2). We consulted experts, the YPAG and relevant organizations to identify grey literature. A call for evidence was disseminated via Twitter to invite schools, organizations and young people to submit evidence. We used the review software package Rayyan but, as this study was a review, there was no statistical code.References1. McManus, S.

This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting. For further information on Nature Portfolio policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.StatisticsFor all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.n/a ConfirmedThe exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurementA statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedlyThe statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.A description of all covariates testedA description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisonsA full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settingsFor hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomesEstimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculatedOur web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.Software and codePolicy information about availability of computer codeData collection As this study was a review, primary data were not collected. The software Rayyan was used for the collection and analysis of data from existing sources (published and unpublished studies and sources).Data analysis No statistical code was used; Rayyan does not involve coding and no primary data were analysed because this study was a review of existing literature. For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code & software for further information.DataPolicy information about availability of dataAll manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable: - Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets - A description of any restrictions on data availability - For clinical datasets or third party data, please ensure that the statement adheres to our policy  The data that support the findings of this study are included in Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 3 and any further details are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. All data used in this study are available in the individual studies which constitute the review. Submission to a public repository is not applicable. We conducted an exploratory scoping search using Google Scholar to identify key sources and reviews and develop an initial programme theory. For the main search, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO and Web of Science (search terms in Supplementary Table 2). We consulted experts, the YPAG, and relevant organisations to identify grey literature. A Call for Evidence was disseminated via Twitter to invite schools, organisations, and young people to submit evidence. 2nature portfolio  |  reporting summaryMarch 2021Field-specific reportingPlease select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.Life sciences Behavioural & social sciences  Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciencesFor a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdfLife sciences study designAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.Sample size As this was a rapid realist review (with no analysis of aggregate data or meta-analysis), there was no single sample sizeData exclusions As this study was a review there were not data exclusions other than the exclusion criteria for the review itselfReplication Replication was not applicable because this study was a Rapid Realist Review so replication was not required.Randomization Randomization was not required because this study was a Rapid Realist Review (rather than a trial or any other kind of experimental design).Blinding Blinding was not required because this study was a Rapid Realist Review (rather than a trial or any other kind of experimental design).Reporting for specific materials, systems and methodsWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, system or method listed is relevant to your study. If you are not sure if a list item applies to your research, read the appropriate section before selecting a response.

    "abstract": "Universal interventions to promote inclusivity and acceptance of diverse sexual and gender identities in schools could help to prevent mental health problems in this population. We reviewed evidence and developed programme theories to explain which universal interventions work, for whom, in which contexts and why. We conducted a rapid realist review and extracted data in context-mechanism-outcome configurations, to develop and refine programme theories. We included 53 sources and identified five intervention themes: student pride clubs, inclusive antibullying and harassment policies, inclusive curricula, workshops and staff training. Here, we show that these interventions could work by reducing discrimination, bullying and marginalization. Interventions appear to work best when school staff are trained and the school climate is supportive and may be less effective for boys, gender minority students and bisexual students. Our findings provide guiding principles for schools to develop interventions and should encourage primary research to confirm, refute or refine our programme theories",
