INTRODUCTION Randall and Jose—two men from Houston, Texas—recently became engaged.1 The couple took a cab ride home late one night, sharing a brief kiss during the car ride.2 The cab driver, enraged by the kiss, pulled over and demanded the men exit the car.3 Terrified, Randall and Jose complied with the driver’s demands and exited the car, leaving them stranded on the side of a highway.4 They had to walk along the highway, under a bridge, and across a busy road to wait for another cab to drive them home.5 Thankfully, the couple returned home safely.6 Usually, anti-discrimination laws provide protection from this type of conduct.7 However, Texas is one of the many states without any anti-discrimination laws for LGBTQ+ people, so the couple had no legal recourse under public accommodations laws.8 Usually, cities also have ordinances extending protections to LGBTQ+ people from this type of discrimination, but Houston repealed their ordinance, leaving Jose and Randall without protection.9 Recently, controversy over anti-discrimination laws has focused on the tension between First Amendment religious freedom arguments and services for LGBTQ+ people.10 For example, wedding service providers, like bakeries, claim that providing services to LGBTQ+ couples infringes on their First Amendment rights.11 They argue that providing a cake or services for a gay wedding forces  1.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 511 In Cedar Point, the Supreme Court held that a California regulation requiring labor union access to private farms qualified as a taking.26 The Cedar Point decision seems to revive property rights as a challenge to anti-discrimination laws.27 The decision could undermine anti-discrimination laws, which restrain private owners’ right to exclude and provide a right of access to the public.28 For example, anti-discrimination laws would qualify as a taking because they provide racial minorities entry onto private land in the same way the labor regulation allowed union representatives.29 This Comment argues that First Amendment religious exceptions to anti-discrimination laws and a misreading of Cedar Point by private businesses would make LGBTQ+ discrimination legally acceptable.30 Because the current anti-discrimination framework does not protect the LGBTQ+ community, the Senate should enact the Equality Act to extend formal legal protection to the LGBTQ+ community.31 Part II explains the history of anti-discrimination laws and suggests racial discrimination as a model for responding to LGBTQ+ discrimination, and demonstrates why Cedar Point seems to legitimize arguments raised to try to avoid  26.

PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS AND THE RIGHT TO EXCLUDE In 1964, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act (1964 Act), outlawing discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, and national origin.34 Title II of the 1964 Act applies specifically to businesses open to the public and prohibits discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, and national origin.35 Congress was reacting specifically to the demands of the civil rights movement, seeking an end to segregation on the basis of race and color.36 At the time, however, the LGBTQ+ community’s concerns were not yet on Congress’s mind.37 As a result, there is no federal protection for the LGBTQ+ community.38 At the state level, a number of states have not provided such protections under their state public accommodations laws.39 The 1964 Civil Rights Act provides a framework for how to remedy such discrimination.40 Section A establishes that the response to racial discrimination should serve as a guiding principle for addressing LGBTQ+ discrimination.41 Section B discusses the ruling in Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, and how the decision may undermine civil rights protections.42 A. Racial Exclusion, Public Accommodation Law, and the Struggle for Equality At common law, common carriers and innkeepers had to serve the public and could exclude people from their business, but only if they had reasonable grounds to do so.43 The common law required common carriers and innkeepers to provide  32.

United States, determined that Congress could prohibit racial discrimination in businesses accessible to the public.61 After the 1964 Act became law, the Heart of Atlanta motel in Georgia continued discriminating against Black people who tried to stay at the motel.62 The motel owners challenged the law in federal court, alleging that        54.

Free Exercise of Religion Claims: A Loophole for LGBTQ+ Discrimination? The constitutional question as to whether religious claims provide an exception to anti-discrimination laws remains open.78 Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Masterpiece Cakeshop) did not resolve the issue.79 In Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery owner raised two First Amendment challenges against serving a gay couple.80 First, he argued forcing him to create a cake for a same-sex couple violates his free speech rights by compelling him to express a message he disagreed with.81 Second, he argued requiring him to create cakes for same-sex couples infringes his religious practice and violates the First Amendment’s free exercise of religion.82 Instead of answering the First Amendment questions, the Court focused on evidence that Colorado’s Civil Rights Commission made “disparaging” comments during the hearings to resolve the case.83 The Court thus declined to reach the actual issue presented in the case, leaving the question unresolved.84 The controlling case on the free exercise question is Employment Division, Department    75.

Smith (Smith).85 In Smith, the Court held the free exercise clause does not provide an exception for an individual’s religious beliefs under neutral, generally applicable laws.86 The Court has grown increasingly skeptical of Smith.87 The Supreme Court was intensely divided by the Smith issue when it was last before the Court.88 In Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, Justice Alito, joined by Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, supported providing religious exemptions in certain contexts.89 Justice Coney Barrett, joined by Justices Kavanaugh and Breyer, rejected the historical argument in Alito’s concurrence and declined to revisit Smith.90 As it stands currently, where a law is neutral and generally applicable, there is no exemption for religious beliefs from compliance.91 Another instructive case is Runyon v. McCrary, where a private school discriminated against Black children attempting to enroll.92 The private school association argued that desegregating the school violated the parents’ rights of free association, privacy, and their right to determine the education of their children.93 The Court rejected the parent’s freedom of association claim, arguing that private discrimination was not constitutionally protected.94 Taken together, Smith and Runyon instruct that neutral, generally applicable laws must be followed because there is no protected right to freely discriminate.95  85.

Hassid cements the right to exclude as an important property right.96 In this case, private farm owners challenged a California regulation, arguing it violated their right to determine who accessed their property.97 The regulation required agricultural employers permit union representatives onto the land up to three hours a day, 120 days out of the year.98 In response to attempts by United Farmworkers’ Union representatives to enter their premises, Cedar Point Nursery (Cedar Point) and Fowler Packing Company (Fowler), brought a takings claim against California in federal court.99 They argued that the regulation imposed an obligation to permit the union organizers’ entry onto their land, effectively requiring them to give away their right to exclude.100 According to Cedar Point and Fowler, this obligation permitted the government to appropriate their property for someone else to use in violation of their Fifth Amendment rights.101 The lower courts rejected this argument.102 First, the district court rejected the argument because the regulation did not require continuous public access.103 Second, the companies did not satisfy the Penn Central test because they failed to show economic harm.104 Under Penn Central, affected persons have to show that the regulation harms their economic interests in the property, and they must show the extent of that harm.105 The court also examines the regulation to determine whether the government action crosses over into a “physical invasion” of property.106 In the district court’s view, plaintiffs did not allege economic harm, so     96.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 519 the court ruled against the farm owners.107 The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court, finding the regulation did not amount to continuous physical access, and union access did not result in economic harm.108 The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit’s decision.109 Cedar Point held that a taking has occurred when the government permits physical invasions of property, whether temporary or permanent.110 The Court determined that a per se taking occurs when a “regulation results in a physical appropriation of property.”111 The California regulation “appropriates” the right to invade the companies’ property, and therefore, goes beyond acceptable regulation on private property.112 The Court relied on two reasons for its conclusion.113 First, the Court argued that the right to exclude is “one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights. . . [of] property.”114 Therefore, the Court determined greater attention applies to regulations that permit physical access onto private property.115 Second, “government-authorized physical invasions” are takings because they take a right to use the property for a specified purpose away from the landowner and give it to another party.116 The Court compared the labor regulation to takings that resulted from government flights over private farmland and access by the public to a private pond.117 Similarly to those prior cases, the regulation at issue impaired the companies’ right to exclude by requiring union access, thus resulting in a physical invasion.118 Cedar Point thus holds that where the government authorizes physical invasions—temporary or permanent—it is a per se taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.119    107.

CEDAR POINT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPACT ON ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS Cedar Point holds that a per se taking occurs when the government authorizes a physical invasion of private land.120 Under this holding, anti-discrimination laws would be considered government-authorized “physical invasions” into private businesses because such laws permit access onto private land by minority patrons.121 However, anti-discrimination laws apply to businesses open to or accessible by the public whereas Cedar Point applies solely to entirely private businesses with no public access.122 Cedar Point Nursery was not open for public access, as people could not access the farm, nor did it advertise itself as such.123 Cedar Point’s holding cannot be applied beyond the wholly private business at issue there.124 Anti-discrimination laws are still constitutionally sound, even with Cedar Point’s holding.125 Since anti-discrimination laws are still constitutionally sound, the Equality Act is an appropriate response to the issue of LGBTQ+ discrimination.126 The Equality Act updates the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination in public accommodations based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.127 The Equality Act would fill a huge gap in federal public accommodations law, and require States to enact anti-discrimination laws protecting the LGBTQ+ community.128 Section A rejects the arguments for First Amendment exceptions to public accommodations law and argues that racial anti-discrimination laws should guide responses to LGBTQ+ discrimination.129 Section B argues that anti-discrimination laws do not qualify as a taking under Congress’s Commerce  120.

Infra Section III.A. The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 521 Power.130 Section C argues that Cedar Point’s two exceptions extend to anti-discrimination laws, and the Equality Act remains a constitutional effort to address LGBTQ+ discrimination.131 A. The First Amendment Should Not Provide a Loophole for LGBTQ+ Discrimination Even in states with anti-discrimination provisions, the Supreme Court has not clarified whether the First Amendment allows private businesses to discriminate based on religious beliefs or speech.132 The Supreme Court has heard argument in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (303 Creative), addressing whether First Amendment religious claims against LGBTQ+ people are permissible exceptions to compliance with anti-discrimination laws, effectively permitting LGBTQ+ discrimination.133 In 2018, in Masterpiece Cakeshop, a bakery owner argued that creating a cake for same-sex couples violated his right to free speech and exercise of his religious beliefs.134 The Court, however, did not answer either of the constitutional questions the plaintiffs’ arguments posed.135 Instead, the Court viewed the Commission’s “disparaging” comments during the administrative hearing as evidence of religious bias against the bakery owners, depriving them of a fair hearing.136 The same question in Masterpiece Cakeshop is once again before the Court.137 Given the fact that religious arguments for race-based discrimination have been wholly rejected by the Court, the Court should also adopt a similar approach in 303 Creative.138 Piggie Park v.

Board of Education, the Court reasoned that school-segregation laws create a sense of inferiority among those the laws exclude.144 In 2020, LGBTQ+ individuals reported experiencing adverse mental and economic effects from discrimination.145 More than one in three experienced some form of discrimination while three of five transgender individuals also experience discrimination.146 Leaving LGBTQ+ individuals without legal protections exposes them to second-class treatment, on top of the adverse mental and economic effects they are likely already facing.147 Similar concerns regarding the accompanying demeaning stigma and injury to same-sex couples motivated Justice Kennedy in Obergefell v. Hodges (Obergefell).148 The centrality of marriage in U.S. society, and the “constellation of benefits” denied to same-sex couples but not heterosexual couples established a sense of inferiority in same-sex couples.149 This sense of inferiority, like in the      140.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 523 race-based cases, motivated the Court in Obergefell to reject denial of marriage for same-sex couples.150 While access to public accommodations is not a fundamental right, its denial also perpetuates social stigma and discrimination.151 In Romer v. Evans (Romer), the Supreme Court rejected Colorado’s attempt to enact a constitutional amendment withdrawing all legal protections for gays and lesbians.152 The Court rejected Colorado’s claim that it enacted the amendment to protect the associational rights of those with personal or religious opposition to homosexuality.153 In rejecting the amendment, the Court declared, “A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.”154 Romer instructs that creating a secondary class of citizens by denying them protection is impermissible.155 While the Colorado amendment withdrew existing legal protections, states without legal protections create a second-class status for LGBTQ+ Americans.156 The Court’s race-based cases provide the instruction that religious exemptions to discriminate are not permissible.157 When the state neutrally enforces a generally applicable law, that law is permissible even if there are incidental effects on religious groups or persons.158 The 1964 Civil Rights Act is a neutral law applying generally because it applies to all private businesses open to the public engaged in interstate commerce.159 Therefore, despite any incidental effects on religion, the law is constitutional as a neutral, generally applicable law.160    150.

Why Cedar Point Does Not Make Anti-Discrimination Laws Unconstitutional  Fear over Cedar Point focuses on the ruling potentially being used to sweep away anti-discrimination laws and usher in the legitimation of the right to exclude as a license to discriminate.166 Since Cedar Point holds that such physical invasions are unconstitutional, then anti-discrimination laws arguably fall under the Court’s decision.167 In dissent, Justice Breyer discusses concern over the majority decision’s applicability to everyday regulations that “regulate property.”168 He explains that the majority ruling could upend food and safety inspection regimes, workplace safety inspections, environmental inspections, amongst others.169 Because such regulations operate in similar ways to anti-discrimination laws,  161.

See id. (explaining the three exceptions created by the majority decision as (1) isolated physical invasions remain[ing] actionable as torts; (2) government access resting on traditional “background restrictions on property rights” and (3) where the property owner receives a government benefit, the government may require the owner “to cede a right of access”). The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 525 Justice Breyer’s concerns reflect Cedar Point’s disruptive potential.170 Labor and civil rights groups also raised alarm that private businesses could discriminate against workers hired and retained if the Supreme Court adopted the property owner’s arguments.171 However, such fears are misplaced because anti-discrimination laws remain constitutional under Congress’s Commerce Power.172 The 1964 Civil Rights Act functioned to remedy economic and social discrimination because they are so entwined.173 The Equality Act is also a valid exercise of legislative and constitutional authority because it addresses national economic concerns over the impact of LGBTQ+ discrimination.174 That Congress is legislating against a moral wrong makes no difference.175 Subsection 1 articulates why anti-discrimination laws are not takings under Congress’s Commerce Power.176 1. Under Congress’s Commerce Power Anti-Discrimination Laws are Constitutional In Heart of Atlanta, the Supreme Court held the 1964 Civil Rights Act constitutional, prohibiting racial discrimination under the Commerce Power.177 The Court reasoned that Congress only needed a reasonable connection between the 1964 Act’s prohibition on racial discrimination and the impediment such discrimination posed to interstate commerce.178 The Court relied on numerous studies showing that racial discrimination impacted Black people’s ability to travel      170.  See Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S. Ct. at 2088–89 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (describing the majority’s approach as a “complex legal scheme” and pondering, “So, if a regulation authorizing temporary access for purposes of organizing agricultural workers falls outside of the Court’s exceptions and is a per se taking, then to what other forms of regulation does the Court’s per se conclusion also apply?”).  171.

See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258 (1964) (supporting Congress’s effort to eliminate racial discrimination by only requiring a reasonable link between regulating the economic activity, and the impediment to interstate commerce). 173.

See Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 257 (“Congress was not restricted by the fact that the particular obstruction to interstate commerce with which it was dealing was also deemed a moral and social wrong.”). 176.

Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824)) ( “[T]he power of Congress to regulate commerce among the States is plenary, ‘complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.’”).  178.  See Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 257–58 (relying on the facts in the record showing that racial discrimination had a far-reaching impact on interstate commerce and requiring nothing more than a reasonable relation between the law and its connection to alleviating the discrimination).  2023 / Inclusion as New Property Right 526 and engage in interstate commerce.179 The Court’s logic in Heart of Atlanta should also protect against LGBTQ+ discrimination because the economic impacts of LGBTQ+ discrimination similarly harm LGBTQ+ peoples.180 Congress’s passage of the Equality Act would eliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.181 The Equality Act has a reasonable connection to Congress’s Commerce Power because LGBTQ+ discrimination also implicates interstate travel and interstate trade.182 The economic results of LGBTQ+ discrimination causes “a kind of permanent recession,” due to the impact on labor opportunities and health-related costs.183 The economic implications of LGBTQ+ discrimination thus affirm the Equality Act as a valid exercise of Congress’s Commerce Clause power.184 C. Businesses Holding Themselves Out to the Public Have a Limited Right to Exclude There are two ways in which businesses open to the public have limited rights to exclude.185 The first way requires them to cede a right of access in exchange for a business license.186 The second arises from common law restrictions.187 A business allowing the public to use its services cannot arbitrarily exclude members  179.  See Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U.S. at 261–62 (declaring Congress has broad power to regulate commerce to ensure no barriers arise so long as such actions satisfy the Constitution).  180.

The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 527 of the public.188 As a result, public accommodations do not have an unlimited right to exclude.189 Subsection 1 addresses the role that business licensing plays in regulating the rights of private businesses.190 Subsection 2 explores how the Equality Act merely codifies the common law rule and expands the definition of public accommodations.191 1. Business Licensing Restricts the Right to Exclude Under the logic of Cedar Point, the Court recognizes an exception for government regulations that regulate publicly accessible businesses.192 Since anti-discrimination laws are merely “regulating” business, it remains appropriate for the government to place limits on who such businesses may exclude.193 The private place of business is open to the public and—to protect minorities—the government may place restrictions on the business’s right to exclude.194 The regulation in Cedar Point, by contrast, arguably infringed the rights of a private business fully inaccessible to the public.195 This difference between the accessibility and inaccessibility of the public was meaningful enough for the Court to note this distinction itself.196 The Equality Act applies to private businesses open to the public as it adopts the definition of public accommodations under federal law.197 To ensure businesses do not discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals, the right to exclude may be restricted by regulation.198 Both the federal government and states have an interest in protecting the economic participation of all groups.199 The Equality Act provides the means through which the federal government may      188.

The Equality Act Codifies the Common Law Rule and Expands the Definition of Public Accommodations During the 19th century, public accommodations had a limited right to exclude under the common law.202 The common law operated similarly to the way anti-discrimination laws do today, but applied only to hotels, inns, and transportation.203 In the Civil Rights Cases, the Court refused to extend the Fourteenth Amendment to include private discrimination, but believed that state common law would protect Black Americans.204 It was not until passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that the common law rule was re-established.205 The Court in Heart of Atlanta understood the 1964 Civil Rights Act to codify this rule.206 In Cedar Point, the Court recognizes an exception for “longstanding background restrictions.”207 “Longstanding background restrictions,” the Court notes, include access to private property where there is an emergency.208 The common law rule for public accommodations should also fall under this exception because it also qualifies as a “longstanding background restriction.”209 The Equality Act is therefore an updating of the codified rule to include access to all regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.210 Cedar Point does not abridge this rule, but on the contrary, accounts for it.211  200.

See Cedar Point Nursery, 141 S. Ct. at 2079 (“[M]any government-authorized physical invasions will The University of the Pacific Law Review / Vol. 54 529 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 defines public accommodations as businesses such as movie theaters, restaurants, and hotels.212 Subsequent legislation—such as the Americans with Disabilities Act—expands the definition.213 This expansion is important because subsequent congressional action demonstrates that the limited facilities in the 1964 Civil Rights Act are not the only places discrimination is prohibited.214 The Equality Act, therefore, modernizes both the types of public accommodations under its command, and updates the rule to eliminate sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination.215 IV. CONCLUSION Cedar Point, at first glance, appears to hold destructive potential for anti-discrimination laws.216 Its holding—physical invasions permitted under government authority are takings—could sweep a plethora of regulations into extinction.217 However, Cedar Point should be understood as a narrow ruling.218 First, prohibiting discrimination is an appropriate exercise of Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause.219 Second, unlike the private farm in Cedar Point, public businesses make themselves accessible to the public.220 As such, business licensing regimes or the traditional common law duties codified by the 1964 Civil Rights Act limits the right of public businesses to exclude.221 Civil rights law  not amount to takings because they are consistent with longstanding background restrictions on property rights.”). 212.
