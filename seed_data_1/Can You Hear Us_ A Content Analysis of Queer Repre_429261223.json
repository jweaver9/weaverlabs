For decades, scholarsfrom countless disciplines have mined cartoons, magazines, films, books, and countless othermedia forms for who they represent, how they are represented, and what effects they have onaudiences. Diverse media representation shows us the good, bad, and ugly of how differentcommunities are portrayed by media industries and how that affects the opinions of mediaconsumers toward those groups. Despite this broad field of study, little work has been done tostudy different aspects of the burgeoning podcasting industry.Though a relatively new medium — the word “podcast” was first coined in 2004 by BenHammersley, a columnist for The Guardian — podcasts have quickly pervaded modern society,echoing the style of old radio shows (Hammersley). Based on research from Edison ResearchInfinite Dial in 2020, estimates suggest that over a third of Americans have listened to a podcastin the last month and nearly 25% of people listen to podcasts weekly (Winn). Unique to podcastsis their accessibility to both their audiences and the creators who want to enter the platform, aswell as the freedom of podcast content, allowing creators the ability to create stories for largeaudiences that would struggle to be told elsewhere.Podcast listeners have unrestricted access to podcasts. A range of online platforms andapps — like Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Audioboom, and Spotify — are home to podcasts andallow listeners to download episodes at any time for free. The wide distribution and lack offinancial investment attract large audiences, and the option to download episodes allowsaudiences to listen to shows at their leisure as many times as they want. There are hundreds ofthousands of podcast shows and millions of episodes for audiences to choose from, a number thatgrows daily, ensuring that listeners will be able to find content that specifically appeals to their4individual tastes (Winn). Just as it is easy for listeners to find and listen to shows, it is just aseasy for the average person to create and share their own podcast show.Unlike media like film, television, and books, there is nearly no gatekeeping for creatorsto enter the podcast industry. Podcasts are relatively easy to produce; as Cecil Baldwin, the leadvoice actor for the Welcome to Night Vale podcast, explains, “‘if you can get your hands on amicrophone and a computer, you can make an artistic endeavor that has the potential to be heardby literally billions of people’” (Considine 43). Mainstream media present several barriers forcreators, like large overhead fees, long production processes, and even content censorship.Professor Sarita Malik and research fellow Photini Vrikki, in their work on how podcasts couldbe used for social justice as an anti-racist tool, note that podcasting stands out from other mediaindustries with its “flexible production (predominantly self-organised, low-budget, content-led,and operating outside traditional regulatory structures), and… its potential to produce narrativesthat oppose exclusionary forms of representations and politics found in” other media (Vrikki andMalik 276). Podcasts, with their open online nature, can thus exist outside of dominant industryhierarchies and even challenge hegemonic entities and narratives. This leads to a mass ofindependent creators of podcasts, as opposed to a small dominant group of corporate contentproducers.Along with a proliferation of independent creators, the lack of bureaucratic interventionalso allows podcast creators freedom with their content. Since “podcasts aren’t restricted bytraditional broadcast regulations,” creators can make shows on just about any topic (Hennig).Compared to media created for the masses like blockbuster films, many independent podcastsintend to reach a targeted audience, not the greatest number of people. Podcast creators lackconcern over censorship, which many mainstream books, movies, and TV shows struggle and are5unable to do. New media, like podcasts, can be “a space for creativity and production because ofease of accessibility,” with the benefits being that they are “more flexible and open, and lessconstraining” (McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 41). Podcasters can afford to take moreauthorial “risks,” including creating content that larger production companies and mediagenerally tend to avoid, such as queer or racially diverse characters and narratives.Within podcasting is the subgenre of “audio dramas.” These serialized fiction podcaststend to be less popular than their nonfiction counterparts (with a few exceptions) and tell a storywith a cast of characters through dialogue, music, and sound effects. This is a small, yet growing,niche within the podcast industry, but it offers a rich array of shows that fully portray the creativefreedom that independent podcast creators have; its openness welcomes “more diverse storiesand voices” to share them (Copeland 220). Most audio dramas are independently produced,though large and established corporations, like iHeartRadio, are present in the genre, and theBBC has been creating radio dramas for decades. Podcasts are “a space increasingly dominatedby professional media producers,” but just as many creators operate independently of anycorporation (Bottomley 180). Since podcasts are so widely available through the Internet andapps, any show, no matter its producer, can reach a global audience (Dann 144).In my own consumption of audio dramas, I have consistently noticed the prominence ofqueer characters in some of the shows. Significantly, there is an overall normalization andabundance of queer characters in this genre that is unlike any other media I consume. Whereasmovies tend to turn the fact that a character is queer into the focal point of its plot, queercharacters in podcasts simply exist and are treated with the same respect given to straightcharacters. These audio dramas serve as spaces where queer fans can see themselves reflected inmedia without being turned into a spectacle. The “circulation of queer desires, experience, and6voices” is vital for audiences who can finally see their own voices represented (Copeland 210).The types of queer representation in audio dramas vary, just as the shows and their premisesvary. Queer representation that is so easily accessible and freely made is invaluable and allowsfor a multiplicity of stories and perspectives that affect their queer listeners in positive ways thatI will discuss in the ensuing chapters. The podcast medium is ideal for diverse storytelling,revealing the impact and role that audio dramas have in producing a range of stories that cannotbe found in other media forms, and the benefits it can have on the diverse audiences who arelistening.To analyze this queer representation in audio dramas, I will look at episodes, characters,and plotlines from seven popular audio drama shows. The shows are as follows: Welcome toNight Vale, Alice Isn’t Dead, The Bright Sessions, ars PARADOXICA, King Falls AM, TheStrange Case of Starship Iris, and The Magnus Archives. I chose these shows in particularbecause of my familiarity with them, the prevalence of queer characters in the show, and theirrelative popularity in the audio drama genre. Though the listenership of these shows greatlyvaries, from millions to only a few hundred thousand, they all have deeply dedicated fanbases,and listeners tend to be fans of more than one of these shows; though their content differs in itsgenre, these shows all exist in the same orbit. Since I was unable to find accurate and currentnumbers regarding the number of episode downloads each show has (which is how listenership isroughly measured), I also took into consideration the number of Twitter followers the shows’accounts had and the number of ratings the shows had on Apple Podcasts since these are the onlymetrics I could find that are up-to-date and available to the public. Initially, I had planned toanalyze more shows, like Girl in Space and EOS 10, but I decided against it. In conjunction withbeing unfamiliar with it, EOS 10 had fewer Twitter followers and ratings compared to the other7shows (@eos_10). Girl in Space, though it has a significant number of Twitter followers at overnine thousand, had very infrequent and offhand discussions of sexuality and gender identity,despite queer characters being present, and thus I felt that it did not have enough material towork with (@girlinspacepod).I will look at the role of queer characters in these shows and the focus, or lack thereof, ontheir sexualities and gender identities (specifically, any nonbinary or transgender characters), aswell as how those identities potentially affect the show’s overall plot. I will also look closely atWelcome to Night Vale, King Falls AM, and The Magnus Archives to analyze fan reception onsocial media and the communities that fans create around these shows. This will provide aglimpse into fan opinions of the shows and their reactions to queer characters, their plotlines, andthe influence these characters have on the audience.Throughout my analyses, I use the term “queer” as a reclaimed umbrella term thatencapsulates any non-heterosexual sexuality and any non-cisgender gender identity. “Queer” alsoallows for nonspecificity and ambiguity when it comes to identities, which is especially helpfulsince I will be looking at characters who have no definitively labeled identities, but who areeither not heterosexual or not cisgender. The only exception to this is when I discuss or quotefrom the work of others, in which case I will default to the acronyms or labels they use (LGB,LGBTQ, LGBTQ+, etc.).I recognize that audio dramas are a small subgenre within the emerging medium ofpodcasts and, therefore, these shows are not reflective of mainstream media trends. Streamingservices like Netflix have canceled a number of popular shows with LGBT representationprematurely (Mussen). In a study of young adults and their opinions on LGBTQ representationin traditional media, television and film are shown to repeatedly “represent LGBTQ people as8one-dimensional and stereotypical” and “ignore... many LGBTQ sub-groups,” like asexualityand non-binary individuals (McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 32). Though not the case in allinstances, queer representation is either overly simplified or erased altogether time and timeagain in mainstream media. However, that does not lessen the importance or the influence ofrepresentation in these audio dramas.Studying these queer characters shows the work currently being done, as well as therespectful approach that is taken to portray them, which is not always afforded to marginalizedgroups in fictional media. These shows depict situations in which the identity of a queercharacter is not an overwhelming part of their personality and is not turned into a spectacle orplot point; these characters are who they are and they are not made to feel any different fromother characters based on their identities. This is a type of representation that other media formshave struggled to show, which is “indicative of ‘the values, fears, and intolerance of programdevelopers and producers,’” so this makes audio dramas even more important to analyze (qtd. inMcInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 42). It is less to see how audio dramas are able to achieve thisnormalization, but rather to show that this normalization is possible and that creators are activelyand successfully doing so without any underlying motives for their actions other than to tell astory. This is especially true since the majority of audio drama creators do not earn much moneyfrom their shows (if they earn any at all), and if they do, it is primarily through advertisementsand crowdfunding.Studies have looked at the relationship between queer audiences and media, specificallytelevision and film, at length. Many queer people often turn their attention to media sources tosee queer characters “largely due to the absence of any interpersonal resources willing to provideinformation, validation, or support,” an unfortunate and harmful result of the systemic9oppression of queer people in society (Bond, “Portrayals” 38). In one of Bradley Bond’s studies,he builds upon previous research, which suggests that “exposure to depictions of sexuality in themedia may influence the well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents,” by furtherexploring the relationship between LGB adolescents’ exposure to mainstream and gay- andlesbian-oriented media, self-discrepancies, and well-being (Bond, “The Mediating Role” 51). Inthis context, gay- and lesbian-oriented (GLO) media is specifically targeting LGB audiences andfeatures LGB characters. Bond concluded that exposure to GLO television is positivelyassociated with the well-being of LGB teens, and suggests that increased exposure to GLOmedia could decrease a perceived difference between their actual and ideal selves; mere exposureto GLO media helps adolescents feel less isolated and ostracized. GLO media that aims tonormalize LGB identities can benefit LGB adolescents in helping to validate their sexualities.Though it can be argued either way whether these podcasts could be considered GLO media,they do feature queer characters and seem to have a significant number of queer listeners, as willbe discussed in “Fan Responses On Social Media.” Therefore, exposure to some of the podcastscan benefit queer audiences in providing positive depictions of queer characters, alleviating someof the loneliness and isolation queer fans might be experiencing, as well as aiding their sense ofwell-being and identity formation.In another study, this one conducted by professors Lauren B. McInroy and Shelley L.Craig, participants ages 18-22 years old who self-identified as LGBTQ were interviewed abouttheir opinions on the portrayals of LGBTQ young people in the media. The LGBTQ adults inthis study reported that they found comfort and identity validation from portrayals of LGBTQpeople in film and television. However, in the face of poor and rigid representations in traditionalmedia, some of the participants instead turned to new media (mostly online platforms) for10creative endeavors and as spaces where they could interact with other LGBTQ young people(McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 41). New media, like online blogs and social media, featuremore user-generated content and allow for online spaces where LGBTQ communities can form;these spaces provide LGBTQ users with interconnectivity and on-going conversations withothers, as well as support, information, and role models. This interconnectedness will also bediscussed as I analyze fan opinions in further detail in “Fan Responses On Social Media.” Ingeneral, podcasts can also be considered new media, and these audio dramas serve as spaces forqueer communities where fans can interact and support each other based on the commonality ofbeing fans of the same show.Queer audiences have come to (sometimes begrudgingly) consume any form of queerrepresentation in different media because meaningful and accurate media representations andreal-life role models are few and far between. Though the number of queer characters inmainstream media, like broadcast, cable, and streaming shows, is increasing every year (howevermarginally) these characters are often still lacking in critical depth and diversity (GLAAD MediaInstitute). Traditional media have proved to be lacking in positive queer representation, whichhas harmful repercussions on queer audiences, who are unable to see themselves reflectedrealistically in addition to having few in-person queer role models.Unlike traditional media, the audio dramas I will examine feature diverse identities in anarray of plotlines and lifestyles. These queer characters are multidimensional and havepersonalities and purposes outside of their sexual identity or gender. Audio dramas like the ones Iwill analyze show the easy normalization of queer identities in a number of situations. This is notto say that bigger media corporations will immediately adopt this practice because it has beenshown to be possible since they have historically been slow to adapt to change and11diversification, but it shows a triumphant success for queer audiences and movement in apositive direction for the community. This idyllic representation normalizes queer characters andshows that people can have different sexualities and gender identities without it becoming anordeal or something to focus entirely on. Especially for the younger audiences listening to audiodramas, normalized representation shows a hopeful future for queer listeners of completeacceptance, which is increasingly important in a world that still refuses to fully acknowledge andembrace the existence of queer people.12Qualitative ObservationsConstant Comparative MethodologyMy examination of these podcasts is based on sociologist Barney G. Glaser’s constantcomparative qualitative analysis method that he developed in 1965. The method encouragessimultaneous coding and analysis to systematically generate a conclusive and integrated theorybased on the data studied. I chose the constant comparative analysis for its use in “generating andplausibly suggesting… many properties and hypotheses about a general phenomenon,” yet, “noattempt is made to ascertain either the universality or the proof of suggested causes or otherproperties” (Glaser 438). These elements are useful considering the sheer number of audio dramashows, the lack of existing literature on them, and the diversity of their characters. Audio dramastend to differ greatly in premise, length, cast, and plot, so using the constant comparative methodallowed me to consolidate common themes that arose throughout my research — themes that aresubstantiated by these specific shows, but which might not be the case for all other audio dramaswith queer themes. The goal of my research was to find commonalities in a select amount ofshows as a sample of the industry and to contextualize these themes within the greater discourseof queer representation in media. Seeing as how little work has been done on content analyses ofaudio dramas in an academic context, I was limited to my own novel discoveries andconclusions.I chose these seven podcasts while considering both my familiarity with them as well asmetrics that helped me infer their popularity, such as Twitter followers and the number of listenerratings on Apple Podcasts. Over the past several years, I have come to listen to nearly all of themin some capacity. In my own experience, these shows tend to garner overlapping fan bases —that is to say, if you are a fan of one of these shows, there is a good chance that you have at least13heard of another one of these shows, be it through word of mouth, social media or online forums.As previously mentioned, these shows vary greatly in their content, yet a clear through line istheir inclusion of queer characters.In studying these shows, I used my prior knowledge and revisited select episodes, notingany and all aspects of queer characters: how many appeared in each show, (how) was theirsexuality discussed, was the character a stereotype, is the character in a relationship, etc. Fromthese detailed examinations, I then started looking for common elements between shows andultimately settled on the following themes: explicit and implicit mention of sexual orientation orgender identity, prominence of a character’s identity or queer relationship to the plot, anddiscussion of a character’s sexuality or gender with another person and their reception.Podcast Show SummariesHere, I provide brief summaries of each show I studied. These summaries are basic andare by no means entirely comprehensive of the plot or key characters — for the sake of brevitysince some shows have close to two hundred episodes — but they give enough context for ageneral understanding of each show’s premise. The summaries are derived from the descriptionseach show puts on its website or another online platform.Welcome to Night Vale is one of the first independent audio drama shows to break into themainstream and capture public attention. Welcome to Night Vale is set in the style of a radio showhosted by Cecil Palmer, who reports the weather, announcements, and news for the strange deserttown of Night Vale. Carlos, a scientist whose move to Night Vale is news in the first episode,eventually becomes Cecil’s long-term partner (Welcome to Night Vale).14Alice Isn’t Dead, produced by the same team as Welcome to Night Vale, follows Keisha,who uses her job as a truck driver to search across the United States for her presumed-dead wife,Alice. Throughout her travels, Keisha encounters strange towns, inhuman murderers, and aconspiracy greater than her missing wife (“Alice Isn’t Dead”).The Bright Sessions explores Dr. Joan Bright’s therapy sessions for her patients,categorized as “atypicals,” who all have unique superhuman abilities — Sam can time travel,Chloe can read minds, and Caleb is an empath. The show follows the patients’ struggles andtriumphs with their abilities (The Bright Sessions).ars PARADOXICA follows Dr. Sally Grissom when a science experiment goes wrong andshe is sent back in time from the present to the Cold War era. Grissom’s sudden appearance landsher a job conducting physics and spacetime projects for the US government, and her audiorecordings document both her work as well as the inevitable and dangerous consequences ofaltering time (“ars PARADOXICA”).King Falls AM focuses on King Falls, a small mountain town, and its late-night radio talkshow. Co-hosts and best friends Sammy Stevens and Ben Arnold air their show nightly,discussing all of the strange, and possibly paranormal, events and inhabitants of the town (“KingFalls AM”).The Strange Case of Starship Iris takes place in 2189 after Earth narrowly won anintergalactic war against extraterrestrials. Biologist Violet Liu finds herself aboard a spacecraftfull of smugglers after her research vessel was destroyed in a mysterious explosion. Violetadjusts to life with her new crewmates, including Arkady, Brian, and Krejjh, as they traverse theuniverse in search of answers (“The Strange Case of Starship Iris”).15The Magnus Archives is a horror anthology relaying stories from the Magnus Institute,which specializes in documenting esoteric and unusual occurrences. In cataloging and followingup on statements of strange events, head archivist Jonathan Sims, and his co-workers, includingMartin Blackwood, uncover unsettling connections between statements and the greater, terrifyingpicture those connections create (“The Magnus Archives - Horror Podcast”).Thematic CommonalitiesExplicit Mentions of Sexual Orientation and Gender IdentityThis first theme is the explicit mention of any sexuality or gender identity label. There isimportance, and sometimes a necessity, in outright naming some specific sexualities and genderidentities in the media. From my observations, I found an interesting trend of sexualities thatwere explicitly stated: across three different shows, asexuality and bisexuality were eachmentioned twice and were the only notable sexualities to be stated. For gender identities, therewas only one instance of a character stating that he was a transgender man.ars PARADOXICA Sally: “I’m asexual, I get it.” (“Greenhouse”).The Bright Sessions Chloe: “But you know how rare it is for me to really fall forsomeone. And then there’s the whole ace thing - some peopledon’t want to sign on for that.” (“Chloe”).Sam: “I know that Mark is bisexual.” (“September 24th, 2016”).The Strange Case ofStarship IrisViolet: “So no matter how many times my team pretended not tounderstand my directions, or moved stuff I needed to shelves Icouldn’t reach, or made comments they knew I could overhear,part of me was always asking, ‘Are they trying to force me toquit, or is it all in my head? Is this really about — you know,racism, classism, sexism, biphobia, some or all of the above —or is it about me?” (“Parallel”).16Brian: “I mean, it was the same week I came out to my friendsand family as trans, so. At that point, stress-wise, you’re kindagrading everything on a curve?” (“Phone Home”).Some conclusions can be drawn from these three identities — asexual, bisexual, andtransgender. They are difficult to portray in an audio-only medium without being explicitlystated; there are ways to code for them, such as having a bisexual character show attraction tomultiple genders over time, but the identities are most clearly depicted when they are outrightsaid. Additionally, according to a study researching discrimination and alienation within theLGBTQ+ community, individuals who are asexual, bisexual, and transgender tend to facemarginalization and exclusion from both society and the LGBTQ+ community (Parmenter et al.2, 8). Though these identities have limited mentions in their respective shows, and minimalconversations surrounding them, the overall inclusion and visibility of these identities is ahopeful and positive sign, especially considering the non-stereotypical portrayal of thesecharacters.In the case of asexuality, there is not much representation or discussion of it in fictionalmedia, academia, and the daily lives of many people. In academia, “Very little has been studiedabout asexual individuals,” specifically in the psychological sciences (Parmenter et al. 11). In astudy that surveyed the social and communal lives of asexual individuals, some older participantsfelt distance and disconnect, noting that “People who identify as asexual today seem to be veryyoung and their community is online” (Rothblum et al. 89). Asexual communities seem to belocalized and heavily marginalized, as they are repeatedly excluded and erased not only fromsociety but occasionally from the LGBTQ community as well (Parmenter et al. 8, 11-12). For awider, less informed audience, there is value in having asexuality explicitly mentioned andexplained in a piece of media since many people do not fully understand what asexuality means17or that it exists in the first place. For asexual fans, they get to see their identity clearlyrepresented as prominent, fully developed, and complex characters, who are not defined by theirsexuality and have several healthy, nonsexual relationships: Dr. Sally Grissom is a physicist wholearns to successfully navigate the paradoxes of time travel with co-workers and friends duringthe Cold War, and Chloe is an art student who can hear others’ thoughts and is the one to pulltogether other characters, not only to use their abilities to help Dr. Bright but also eventually as agroup of friends.Bisexuality faces a similar issue of misconceptions and erasure by both the LGBTQcommunity and greater society. Much of the discrimination “is fuelled by stereotypes” thatbisexual people are confused about their sexuality or that they are so hypersexual that onepartner is not fulfilling enough (Bishop and Pynoo 1, 2). The systematic exclusion andmisrepresentation of bisexual individuals are harmful, bringing these people ongoing stress thatcan have serious consequences on their mental and physical health, as concluded in a 2017 studyabout the health effects caused by the stigmatization of bisexual individuals over time (Feinsteinand Dyar 47). Although Violet only briefly mentions her experience with biphobia, that shetalked about it at all reveals its prevalence in her life by listing it alongside instances of sexism,classism, and racism. Like how Sally Grissom and Chloe subvert stereotypes surroundingasexuality, Violet and Mark do the same regarding bisexuality. Throughout the ten episodes ofThe Strange Case of Starship Iris, Violet only shows a romantic interest in Arkady, and the twowomen later enter a monogamous relationship without any questions or invalidations of Violet’ssexuality. Mark also has a monogamous and long-term relationship with Sam, a fellow “atypical”who can time travel, and their relationship undergoes all of the normal pressures of relationshipsthat do not feature a bisexual person.18Though depictions of transgender characters are on the rise, they are still a minoritycompared to other queer identities (GLAAD Media Institute). Within the LGBTQ community,like asexuality and bisexuality, transphobia and the rejection of non-cisgender individuals exist(Parmenter et al. 8). Carrie Davis, a social worker and human rights advocate, explains thattransgender people are often stereotyped as “sex workers, mentally ill… and as unlovable”(Davis 16-17). Brian, however, is a linguistics expert who is engaged to one of his crewmates,Krejjh. Brian’s role in The Strange Case of Starship Iris as a key member of the crew is in linewith positive representations of transgender people, in which the characters are “more fullyintegrated into storylines and less tokenistic,” a trait that several LGBTQ participantsemphasized in their discussion of transgender representation in both online and offline media(McInroy and Craig, “Transgender Representation” 612).Implicit Mentions of Sexual Orientation and Gender IdentityI use this category primarily for characters who are in or have been in same-sexrelationships, yet have not explicitly discussed the nature of their sexuality — their presence inthese relationships lends itself to conclude that they are not heterosexual. I also includecharacters who are non-binary or who use gender-neutral pronouns but do not discuss theirgender identity any further.Welcome to Night Vale Cecil: “[Carlos] grinned, and everything about him was perfect,and I fell in love instantly.” (“Pilot”).The Strange Case ofStarship IrisArkady: “What are...you saying?”Violet: (deep breath) “Will you go out with me?”Arkady: “What.”[...]Arkady: “We just heisted a cloud, Liu, I think we’ll manage.”Violet: “Well. Cool.”19Arkady: “Just to be clear, you mean ‘dating’ in the romanticsense, right?”Violet: (laughs)Arkady: “Right?”Violet: “Right. Totally right.” (“Off the Air”).McCabe: “It’s RJ McCabe.”[...]McCabe: “And, uh, I use ‘they’ and ‘them’? Hi.” (“Off the Air”).Arkady: “I’d say, across the board, the only real differencebetween us and them is the numbers, the purple skin and, I don’tknow, some cultural stuff, like I’ve never met a Dwarnian whodidn’t find the whole gender binary thing really frickin’ funny.”Krejjh: “Pardon me, sir or madam, but I simply must know whatgender you are! There’s two whole options, and I can’t reallyexplain why but somehow it’s very important! (laughs)” (“In TheDeep”).The Magnus Archives Melanie: “Right, well… the jury’s still out on Elias. Andanyway, Martin’s always been lovely to you.”Basira: “Hmm. I don’t know, I mean, you should have seen himwhen I turned up last year. I think he thought I was trying tosteal his precious Archivist [Jon]”.[...]Basira: “That boy needs to relax.”Melanie: “Or at least find someone else to fuss over!”Basira: “Yeah, he’s got it bad.”Basira: “Do you know if he and Jon ever…”Melanie: “No clue, and not interested! Although… according toGeorgie, Jon doesn’t.”Basira: “Like, at all?”Melanie: “Yeah.”[...]Melanie: “Well, she [Gerogie] and Jon, they dated…” (“Matterof Perspective”).In light of a lack of clear explanations, we must infer why these characters choose to notdisclose or explicitly state their sexualities and gender identities. Disclosure is not necessary andshould not be expected of a queer person, but it is worth considering some possible reasonsbehind these instances.20The primary reason for implying one’s identity rather than explicitly naming it is theinherent fluidity of queer identities. Shoshana Rosenberg, an academic researcher focusing ongender and sexuality studies, underscores this with the concept of “coming in,” whichcomplicates and challenges the notion of “coming out.” “Coming in” accounts for the complexand on-going process of someone discovering and understanding their identity and thus theirplace in society; it takes into consideration that “a significant aspect of the journey ofqueer-identified people is not simply to come out to others, but rather to come into a place ofacceptance within oneself” (Rosenberg 1806). The experience of being queer is not and shouldnot be defined by a culminating moment of disclosing one’s identity to the world; instead, it is anongoing and nuanced process of self-discovery and pride independent of others andself-disclosure to them.Another reason could be the attempt to avoid the extensive social stresses to explicitlyname one’s identity. This could be the case for RJ McCabe and Jon; McCabe only makes theirpronouns known once they leave their strictly regimented government job and Jon frequentlydeals with the dangers and fears that come with having one’s secrets exposed and the ceaselesssearch for knowledge, no matter the cost to oneself or others. In their 2015 study, researchscientist Jennifer D. Rubin and psychologist Sara I. McClelland interviewed queer women ofcolor in their late teens about their disclosure and expression of their sexuality online. For manyof their participants, depending on their familial, social, or professional situation, “to be queer isone thing, to claim it publicly is another” (Rubin and McClelland 8). Publicly stating one’sidentity can have several consequences, especially in oppressive and unaccepting environments,so the choice to not explicitly disclose one’s identity and manage their visibility is a calculatedand protective decision (Rubin and McClelland 2). Additionally, many people come out to others21several times in their lives, whether it is because they meet new people or because theyselectively choose who they come out to. In the example pulled from The Magnus Archives, thereasoning for non-disclosure could also simply be attributed to the fact that neither Melanie norBasira know firsthand how Jon chooses to identify; they only have information about Jon’sactions they received from other people and thus are left to speculate about Martin and Jon’ssexual and romantic identities.Queer Relationships as Integral to the PlotMost mainstream queer media focus directly on their queer characters and foregroundtheir identities over their relationships with others. Looking at these characters and plotlinesreveals that these three shows prioritize exploring the intensity and passion of a relationshiprather than the fact that it is a queer relationship.Alice Isn’t Dead Keisha: “I thought you were dead, Alice. I really did. I know thatthere is no evidence for it, but…I couldn’t think of anotherreason you would vanish like that. Just gone… I mourned you,Alice. I’ve never loved anyone so hard.”[...]Keisha: “So, my wife wasn’t dead. That’s good to know. That’snew information... I started to look through your things. I had leftthem alone; didn’t want to get tangled in the memories just yet.But now they weren’t memories. They were evidence. Clues to astory you had failed to tell me.”[...]Keisha: “This job [transportation services] takes me all over.Which is where you are. All over.” (“Part 1, Chapter 2: Alice”).King Falls AM Sammy: “I wake up, and the first thing I think about is aboutfinding Jack, and the last thing I see before I go to sleep is Jackasking me, begging me, to come to this town I’d never heard ofcalled King fucking Falls.”[...]Sammy: “But you don’t get it, everything is about him! It alwayshas been!”[...]22Ben: “You followed Jack to King Falls.” (“The Best Imitation ofMyself).The Magnus Archives Archivist/Jon: “...I thought you might be lost.”Martin: “Are you real?”Archivist: “Yes! Yes, I-I-I am. Come on, we’ve got to get out ofhere.”Martin: “No. No, I don’t think so.”Archivist: “Why?”Martin: “This is where I should be. It feels right.”Archivist: “Martin, don’t say that.”Martin: “Nothing hurts here. It’s just quiet. Even the fear isgentle here.”Archivist: “This isn’t right. This isn’t you.”Martin: “It is though. (wry laugh) I really loved you, you know?”[...]Archivist: “Listen, I know you think you want to be here, I knowyou think it’s safer, and well — well, maybe it is. But we needyou. I need you.”Martin: “No, you don’t. Not really. Everyone’s alone, but we allsurvive.”Archivist: “I don’t just want to survive!”Martin: “I’m sorry.”Archivist: “Martin. Martin, look at me. Look at me and tell mewhat you see.”Martin: “I see… I see you, John. (incredulous chuckle) I seeyou.” (“The Last”).Hollywood films have systematically censored and suppressed queer narratives andcharacters for decades. Films in the 1920s and 1930s either did not show overt instances ofsame-sex attraction or only depicted it in an unappealing manner. In 1934, the Motion PictureProducers and Distributors of America enforced a new regulation that banned sexual perversionin films, which many interpreted to include queerness; though the production codes became morelenient when they were restructured under the Motion Picture Association of America in 1966,their rating policies for films that are based on how suitable a movie is for children “marginalizeand stigmatize LGBTQ characters and stories, making them less accessible” to LGBTQ youth(Drushel 184). The production code also applied to television shows. Historically, queer stories23have been silenced and erased for mainstream audiences and when they were told, they wereheavily stereotyped and ridiculed. In the past, queer characters were rarely ever shown to be inromantic relationships (Raley and Lucas 25). More modern queer characters are given the samestereotypical storylines and are one-dimensional, facing either very positive or very negativeoutcomes (McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 34).Understanding the suppression of queer narratives in mainstream media is necessary tohighlight the importance of how queer relationships are portrayed in these three podcasts. Inthese instances, a character’s romantic relationship is the motivator for the progression of theplot. In all three, one character is in search of their partner in an attempt to find and rescue themfrom some outside antagonist. Their love is the driving force that brings them across the country,to strange towns, and into liminal supernatural spaces. What is important to note is that therelationship is the focal point of the plot, not the character’s sexuality — each character in theseinstances just also happens to be in a same-sex relationship. In many mainstream narratives,queer characters are stereotyped and thus their sexual identity becomes the overly simplifiedfocus of most of the characters” (McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 40). Shifting the focus awayfrom their identity and instead toward their complex and dedicated relationships indicatesrespectful depictions since they “go beyond the socially acceptable stereotypes” often given toqueer characters, like comedic relief or a flamboyant gay man (Raley and Lucas 24-25). The“respectful” portrayal of minorities is what communications scholar Cedric C. Clark describes asthe final stage an ethnic group undergoes when shown on television — the first three stages arenon-recognition and exclusion, ridicule rooted in stereotypes, and regulation of the minoritygroup by placing them into socially acceptable roles (Clark 19-21). Though Clark’s analysis in1969 pertains to ethnic minorities on television, the outline can easily be applied to the portrayal24of the queer community across media. Though the premises of these three relationship plotlineshave a surprising amount of overlap, despite how different each show’s world is, they show thatcompelling queer narratives that do not only focus on a character’s queerness can be told, givingqueer characters depth and complexity that they might otherwise lose. Focusing instead onrelationships and love rather than prioritizing their “LGBTQ identity as the defining feature ofcharacters’ identities may be particularly welcome” as a shift away from overused,one-dimensional narratives — a much-welcomed change for queer audiences (McInroy andCraig, “Perspectives” 43).General Discussion of Sexuality: With Whom and Their ReceptionFor this theme, I am only looking at reactions from both parties when one persondiscusses their sexuality or gender, either explicitly or implicitly. These interactions can haveeither positive, neutral, or negative reactions from either party. I classified the positiveinteractions as primarily supportive and a willing disclosure on the part of the queer individual;neutral discussions featured a character stating their queer identity simply as a fact or receivingmixed responses to their disclosure; and a negative discussion was marked by an unwillingdisclosure or discussion of queerness in a demeaning manner.Positive arsPARADOXICAEsther: “When we were in New York, we met for drinks, andone thing led to another… But when it was done, she told methat’s why we didn’t stay together. I’ve been thinking about it alot, and I’m not ashamed of wanting things for myself. And ifthat means I’m losing friends… Well, that’s sad. It’sunfortunate. I hope… I hope we can stay in touch like this.”Sally: “She, huh?”Esther: “…What?”Sally: “You just said she.”Esther: “No– no I didn’t!”Sally: “You did.”Esther: “I said he, I–”25Sally: “That explains… a lot of things.”Esther: “You can’t tell anyone, Sally. Please, please don’t tellanyone.”Sally: “Relax! You don’t have to worry about that with me. I’masexual, I get it.”Esther: “You’re a what?”Sally: “Okay. You know how most ladies you meet are reallyinto men? But you, obviously, are into women. I’m not reallyinto anyone.”Esther: “Really? So, sex–”Sally: “It’s never really done it for me. Like, it’s nice, orwhatever, but… I’ve got bigger stuff to think about, you know?But that means I’m an outlier. Outside of the traditionalsystem. So I get what it’s like. And it also means I don’t carewho you wanna get it on with.” (“Greenhouse”).The BrightSessionsSam: “You are relentless. I swear, you’d matchmake the entireworld if you could.”Chloe: “I can’t help it, I love love.”Sam: “And yet you are incredibly picky when it comes to yourown love life.”Chloe: “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”Sam: “I wasn’t saying there was. I just don’t want you to befocused so much on everyone else’s happiness that you forgetyour own.”Chloe: “I won’t, I promise. But you know how rare it is for meto really fall for someone. And then there’s the whole ace thing— some people don’t want to sign on for that.”Sam: “Which I think is dumb–”Chloe: “No, I get it. You can’t make a relationship work ifwhat you both want out of a relationship is fundamentallyincompatible.”Sam: “Yeah, I guess. I think that person is out there for you,though. Someone that you’ll feel all those warm fuzzy feelingsfor and who will love you for who you are.” (“Chloe”).Dr. Bright: “You know, Caleb, it’s okay if you and Adam likeeach other in that way, it’s perfectly–”Caleb: “I know it’s okay. But, it’s just. I don’t think I’ve everhad a friend like this. Not really. I don’t want to fuck that upwith a bunch of other stuff.” (“Patient #11 (Caleb), Session13”).Neutral Alice Isn’t Dead Keisha: “You [Alice] were not my first, but you were close. Idated Mindy Morris in high school. Mindy and I were friends,and then we knew we were more than friends, and we didn’t26know what to do about that, and then we did know. I wanted tokeep it a secret, she didn’t. We kept it a secret. I think a lot ofpeople knew anyway. I thought my parents for sure had noidea. Eventually, I learned that they knew and were mostly OKwith it. Later they would be completely fine with it. Inbetween, there was an adjustment. Not everything can bealright all at once.” (“Part 2, Chapter 10: Why Am I Alive?”).The Strange Caseof Starship IrisViolet: “You transferred right before finals? Must’ve beenstressful.”Brian: “Mm, probably.”Violet: “Probably?”Brian: “I mean, it was the same week I came out to my friendsand family as trans, so. At that point, stress-wise, you’re kindagrading everything on a curve?”Violet: “Wow, uh. Busy week. Also, to change schools, youwould’ve had to move to a different planet–”Brian: “Which felt, like, kinda uncomfortably metaphoricalwhile I was packing.”Violet: “Yeah. Jesus, that’s rough.”Brian: “Mm, I don’t regret it, though. My parents and most ofmy friends were great about the whole “coming out” thing, butsometimes you want a clean slate, you know? Plus, Wexler hadway more support for trans kids.” (“Phone Home”).Negative King Falls AM Greg: “Don’t. You. Hang. Up. On. Me.”[...]Sammy: “Okay, that’s enough. Ben, hit the button or I’m gonnacome around and do it for you.”Greg: “Maybe mind your gay-ass business and shut the hell upand let me continue, Sammy!”Sammy: “I’m sorry, what the fuck did you just say?”[...]Greg: “I said, mind your gay-ass business, Stevens. Listen,we’ve all heard it, everyone in town knows that if you stoppedpoking your nose in other people’s business, maybe you’d havetime to find your missing boyfriend, Jack, oh boohoo.(mocking)”[...]Ben: “Who you love is who you love, man, you don’t choosethat… I will stand by your side through anything. And that hasabsolutely nothing to do with who you love or who loves you.You are a good man, a good friend. That’s all that matters… Ilove you, Sammy, no matter what.” (“The Best Imitation ofMyself”).27I came across a range of “coming out” and self-disclosure stories — notably, most ofthese conversations were brief and had either a positive or neutral tone. Except for one instanceof a negative conversation, the characters were revealing and discussing their gender and sexualidentities to someone they trusted. This aligns with a 2012 study of participants’ varyingsexuality disclosure within different contexts which indicates that queer “individuals disclosed[their sexuality] most to friends” compared to other areas of their lives, such as religiouscommunities, school peers, and family (Legate et al. 148).The positive interactions were highlighted by support and solidarity with the characterdiscussing their sexuality. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, both of these characters — Dr.Sally Grissom and Chloe — are talking about their experience of being asexual with a friend.Sally’s coworker and friend, Esther, accidentally outs herself, but Sally is quick to reassureEsther and reveal her own sexuality to underscore her acceptance of Esther’s identity. Sallysoothes Esther’s distress, which is understandable during the Cold War era, by willinglydisclosing her own identity to Esther, someone Sally trusts. The conversation between Chloe andSam indicates that Sam is already aware of Chloe’s sexuality with how casually Chloe mentionsit; Sam shows her support for Chloe’s sexuality with her confidence that Chloe will one day meetsomeone who does not have a problem with her asexuality. This conversation shows how asexualpeople can, and do, still desire and pursue romantic relationships, which is not negated by theirrelationship with sexual attraction. Caleb’s discussion with Dr. Bright, his therapist, is also one ofsupport and encouragement as Caleb tries to navigate the romantic feelings he has for his friend,Adam. Caleb is unsure how he should proceed and is anxious about potentially losing his friendif he reveals his feelings, but Dr. Bright helps him sort through his emotions and come to aconclusion.28The neutral interactions were characterized by some sort of struggle with a character’ssexuality, but ultimately overcoming and moving past it — in the cases of Brian and Keisha, theyfaced some unacceptance about their identities when they first came out but gained acceptanceand understanding from others over time. Keisha reflects on her first girlfriend while makingrecordings addressed to her wife, Alice, and how her family, though “mostly” accepting at first,eventually grew to be completely accepting of Keisha’s identity. Similarly, Brian comments onhow “most” of his friends supported him and that he transferred to a more supportive school. Healso focuses on the stress that came with his coming out which is the reality for most queerindividuals when disclosing their identity to others. Both Keisha and Brian’s conversationsreflect the mixed responses one can receive when they come out to friends and family — it is notalways the case that everyone is either emphatically supportive or entirely dismissive, but mostqueer experiences land somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.The only negative interaction was overwhelmingly so in comparison to the otherexamples. Sammy is publicly outed by Greg, a minor antagonist, in a demeaning way live on theradio; Greg not only uses “gay” as an insult but also belittles Sammy’s relationship with hismissing partner, Jack. Sammy is then pulled into an intimate conversation about his sexuality andwhy he hid his identity by his co-host, Ben. Sammy reveals the shame and guilt he feels by nottelling Ben about his relationship and how he had kept his relationship a secret from nearlyeveryone in his life. Sammy also alludes to his hesitancy to make his sexuality known in a smalltown that is quick to make judgments of others, concerned about the risks of being publiclyqueer in a possibly unaccepting environment, like rejection and stigmatization (Legate et. al145). Ben is overwhelmingly supportive, trying to comfort Sammy and reassure him that hisidentity will not affect their friendship. This episode has the longest and most involved29discussion of a character’s identity by far when compared to all of the other shows I researched— Sammy and Ben’s conversation lasts nearly twenty minutes. This is classified as a negativediscussion because Sammy’s choice to self-disclose his identity to others at his own discretionwas taken away from him. Additionally, Sammy shows evidence of being suicidal in thefollowing episodes, due to a combination of being outed as well as his hopelessness over everfinding his missing partner, Jack. However, Sammy’s friends, fellow townspeople, and regularlisteners of his radio program show an outpouring of support for him, both in response to himbeing outed and to help him find his partner.30Fan Responses On Social MediaAudio drama fan communities overwhelmingly tend to exist on social media sites,specifically Tumblr and Twitter. It is difficult to make broad generalizations about thedemographics of these communities since the fandoms are vast interconnected networks onlytied together by the show and not a common forum, and because many fan profiles, especially onTumblr, are relatively anonymous and do not disclose any personal demographic informationunless it is voluntarily given. However, Tumblr’s function as a “virtual counterpublic,” adiscursive space where marginalized groups can congregate outside of the dominant public gaze,does make it an especially appealing site for marginalized and queer youth — the use of the siteis explored in Dr. Olu Jenzen’s ethnographic research of transgender youth and their experiencesonline (Jenzen 1633, 1634). Thus, I have collected a small sample of posts made by listeners ofWelcome to Night Vale, King Falls AM, and The Magnus Archives from Tumblr and Twitter tobegin to examine fan reception of and interaction with these shows.Welcome to Night ValeWelcome to Night Vale is not only a foundational show for the audio drama community asa whole but is also, for many queer fans, an important early piece of media featuring a queerprotagonist. The show rose to great success among all podcast genres in mid-2013 “With thehelp of an outpouring of fan support on… Tumblr,” which helped the show gain “2.5 milliondownloads in July 2013 alone and another 5.8 million downloads that August” (Bottomley 179).Not only was the fandom dedicated enough to exponentially increase Welcome to Night Vale’slistenership, but the show’s rise in popularity also meant its narrative became much moreaccessible and visible to those who were not already familiar with it.31Several fans noted their nostalgia for the show, as they began listening to it when theywere younger, and the impact Cecil as a queer character had on them. One fan, on the bloggingwebsite Tumblr, commented on the value of “the personal connection i (and many other fans)feel w cecil bc he was one of the first gay characters i saw in the media” (Mcrdyke666). Anotherfan reflects on nostalgia they have for the first episode in particular:nostalgia for who i was when i first listened to the first year of episodes, 18 and confusedabout my sexuality but for some reason deeply deeply needing to see cecil’s feelings forcarlos requited, tucked away in the corner of a vacation cabin… so i wouldn’t have to talkto my family who absolutely didn’t approve of cecil and carlos or maybe of me.(Aleatoryw)In line with previous studies, media “is often the first place that individuals — including youngpeople who subsequently identify as LGBTQ — encounter LGBTQ identities,” and characterscan provide the “comfort and inspiration” to fans that is important to the development of theirqueer identities, as based on interviews of young LGBTQ people (McInroy and Craig,“Perspectives” 33, 35). Especially for queer fans who have not come out yet, or who are not inaccepting environments, they can find comfort in shows like Welcome to Night Vale as a form ofescapism that portrays queer characters without also including instances of homophobia. Tumblruser Mcrdyke666 points out that, in Welcome to Night Vale, “homophobia has never been a factor— there’s never been any drama or people reacting badly because they’re gay” (Mcrdyke666).To not integrate homophobia into the storyline and neither foreground nor erase Cecil’squeerness increasingly sets Welcome to Night Vale apart from other mainstream media.Fans also commented on their appreciation of how the show portrays Cecil’s queerness.One Tumblr user talked about how the showhandles queer representation in the most effortless way i’ve ever seen in my search oflgbt media… He also has a family and… a life that doesn’t revolve around being gay. Inlater series, he and Carlos start a relationship and it is the most wholesome thing anyonehas witnessed, there is no drama between them no love triangles and their love progressesat a normal pace. (Casualtreeflower)32This user also notes Carlos’s role and that “he has more than on one occasion saved Night Vale atthe risk of his own life… he is not just there to be someone’s love interest he is his own personand he has his own story” (Casualtreeflower). These comments are made in relation to how manyqueer characters are often depicted in mainstream media, with their queer identity being the focalpoint of their characterization and storyline. Oppositionally, Cecil and Carlos are written asmulti-faceted characters who also happen to be queer.King Falls AMIn contrast to Welcome to Night Vale’s casual handling of queerness, King Falls AM hasa specific episode, “Episode Sixty-Eight: The Best Imitation of Myself,” in which the maincharacter, Sammy Stevens, talks about his queerness, fiancé, and experience being closeted atlength, which was discussed at the end of the last chapter. This episode aired nearly three yearsafter the show began and left many fans in awe, not only because of the reveal of Sammy’squeerness and personal history but also because of the long, heartfelt conversation Sammy haswith his coworker and friend, Ben, in the wake of being outed. Many fans talked about thisepisode in particular, and it is commonly regarded in the fandom as one of the most popular andsignificant episodes of the show. King Falls AM leans heavily into its comedic side, so this moreserious episode stands out to fans not only for its subject matter but because fans saw avulnerable part of Sammy that he had hidden for the two and a half years of the show’s durationat that point.Fans, again, showed their appreciation for the show’s depiction of queerness. One fanshowed gratitude to the writers on Twitter for “creating such great dynamic characters. Therepresentation means a lot, and the show handled it well” (@justallietv). Another Twitter user33remarked how “the gang [the writers and cast] made an exceptionally brave move that I couldnot have anticipated” (@GejWatts). This is reflective of how long the writers waited to revealthat Sammy is queer; until only a few episodes prior, listeners knew very little about Sammy’shistory before the events of the show, and this revelation was widely unexpected. It is interestingto note that this user mentions that Sammy’s queerness was a “brave move,” implying that manyother sources of media actively shy away from having queer protagonists and telling storiesabout queer relationships.The Magnus ArchivesThe Magnus Archives stands out to fans for its treatment of its protagonist, Jon, as amulti-dimensional asexual character who is in a romantic relationship with his partner, Martin.One Tumblr user talks about the prominent subsection of the Magnus Archives fandom that isfull of asexual fans, who fully lean into Jon’s identity, as well as discuss “their own aceexperiences, both with and without relation to jon. it’s just a whole bunch of cool ace people whohave gathered together and built this community within this fandom where we get to have awell-written, canon protagonist who is asexual” (Dickwheelie). Another fan remarked on how“not only is TMA creating this incredible myth-level heart-wrenching love story, but it’s with anasexual character at its heart and come to think of it, almost all of the development andprogression as a canon, requited thing [Jon’s relationship with Martin] took place AFTER jonwas confirmed as asexual,” as well as how asexual fans are “used to being told [in the media]that our love is empty and a waste and a nuisance, rather than it being portrayed as anearth-moving, reality-bending thing that can stand up against the gods themselves”(@datheneth).34These comments reflect the frequent erasure of asexual people in society and theLGBTQ+ community discussed in interviews with LGBTQ+ people about discrimination andoppression within the community (Parmenter et al. 8). Thus, Jon as a well-rounded asexualcharacter has even greater importance, and the fandom gives asexual people an opportunity tocreate an accepting community for themselves, especially as “‘a group that is typicallyexcluded/erased from parts of society as a whole’” (Rothblum et al. 89). A fan on Twitter evenwrote that “the magnus archives have been spoonfeeding me casual representation to the pointthat i sort of don’t know what to do with feeling so seen all the time,” indicating the extreme lackof the casual representation of diverse identities in other media (@tarantulapaws). In aninterview-based study of how LGBTQ participants used social networking sites as informallearning environments while developing their sexuality, some asexual participants explained“that social media is the main way asexuality awareness proliferates” (Fox and Ralston 638).These posts indicate that, at least within the fandom for The Magnus Archives, asexual fans havefound each other and have created a flourishing and welcoming community. This speaks to thepower of positive and quality media representation, for without it, these fans would not cometogether or see a part of themselves in a show quickly growing in popularity.Annually, Tumblr releases a series of lists ranking the most popular topics in a range ofcategories. This year, The Magnus Archives rose seven spots to be second on Fandom’s official“2020’s Top Web Series, Webcomics and Podcasts” on Tumblr and the fifteenth topic overall inthe site’s “Top 20 of 2020” (“2020’s Top Web Series”; “Tumblr’s Top 20”). Even though theshow began airing in 2015, its popularity is currently at its greatest.35SummaryThough these social media posts are individual and do not serve as comprehensiverepresentations of fan opinions as a whole, they provide valuable information and insight as towhat these shows mean to fans and what fans think of how they handle queer representation —in these cases, fans view the shows’ representation in an overwhelmingly supportive light.Looking at these examples highlights the communities and visibly queer personae that thethree shows provide. The characters serve as role models, despite being fictional, which can helpnegate feelings of isolation, alienation, and identity invalidation in queer audiences (McInroy andCraig, “Perspectives” 38). Many queer fans thus form parasocial relationships with queercharacters, feeling that they have close relationships with and understandings of characters eventhough they are fictional. In Professor Bruce E. Drushel’s study on the limited accessibility ofrecommended films that could help LGBTQ adolescents build a positive self-image ofthemselves, he drew the connection that “real-life queer role models may be particularly scarce,”so queer role models can positively impact queer youth as “they explore their sexual identities”(Drushel 179). Online communities and fandoms give queer fans a connection to other queerpeople they might not have in real life as well as “access to interpersonal networks of supportand sociability in safe and anonymous online spaces,” as seen in interviews with Australianqueer young people about their engagement in online communities (Hanckel and Morris 883).This discussion of online communities and role models lends itself to the potentialparasocial relationships fans create with characters. Bradley J. Bond’s 2018 examination of LGBadolescents and the parasocial relationships (PSRs) they create with media personae (both realand fictional) is quite revealing on this matter. First, “LGB adolescents are more likely todevelop PSRs with LGB media personae than heterosexual adolescents” (Bond, “Parasocial36Relationships” 472). Additionally, “LGB adolescents perceived their favorite media personae tobe useful sources of information about their romantic relationships; heterosexual adolescents didnot… LGB adolescents reported the desire to learn about romantic relationships from theirfavorite media personae instead of any real-life relational other beside their friends” (Bond,“Parasocial Relationships” 475). Therefore, the positive queer characters in audio dramas canserve as role models for young queer listeners who lack those relationships and models in theirreal lives and show them the various and numerous relationships and lifestyles queer people canhave; stereotypical portrayals would only serve to negatively influence LGB adolescents, sohaving multidimensional queer characters and plotlines is affirming and beneficial.-37Concluding RemarksDiscussionAudio dramas are a niche subsection of the greater podcast medium. Though thesefictional shows are often produced by independent creators and have relatively small fanbases,they are replete with queer representation that rivals that of major mainstream media outlets liketelevision and film. I analyzed seven popular audio dramas using Glaser’s constant comparativemethod under four thematic categories, as well as some online posts made by fans of three of theshows.The first theme was that of explicit mentions of queer identity — a character clearlystating a queer label for either themselves or another. Interestingly, these mentions centeredaround characters who are asexual, bisexual, and transgender, and were part of a passingdiscussion of the character’s identity. Not only are these identities difficult to fully portray in anaudio-only medium without clear mention, but they also tend to be marginalized identities insociety as well as the queer community. Therefore, the clear inclusion and non-stereotypicalhandling of these identities is a welcome deviation from the norm, whether that beinter-community and social discrimination or erasure altogether.Alongside this theme was the theme of implicit mentions of queerness, when it wasimplied that a character was queer, usually through the character being in a same-sex relationshipor making comments about gender or pronouns. There were no clear or common reasons for whyidentities were never mentioned; however, two possible reasons were explored. The first, basedon academic researcher Shoshana Rosenberg’s concept of “coming in,” is that coming out is nota singular and culminating moment of a person’s journey through their queerness, which isconstantly in flux, so an explicit naming of identity to others is not always necessary, possible, or38important to identity development (Rosenberg 1806). The second reason reflects the anxietiesand dangers that come with disclosing one’s queerness publicly, as explored in Rubin andMcClelland’s 2015 study of young queer women of color and their discussion (or lack thereof) oftheir sexuality on social media in interviews (Rubin and McClelland 2).The theme of queerness as a storyline was initially meant to focus on narratives inwhich a character’s identity was a central part of their existence in the show, such as in the“coming out” narrative which is evident in so many mainstream queer stories, as explored inProfessor Bradley J. Bond’s content analysis of sex and sexuality in LGB entertainment media(Bond, “Sex and Sexuality” 100). However, I found no instance of that, and instead focused onthree shows in which a queer relationship was at the root of the show’s plot. In all threestorylines, the protagonist’s same-sex partner goes missing due to unseen or supernatural forces,and the protagonist’s love for them drives the protagonist on a search, thus driving forward theplot. Foregrounding the power of queer love and dedication between partners is a refreshingapproach not often seen in television and film.The final thematic trend was that of general discussions of sexuality. The conversationswere categorized under labels of positive, neutral, or negative based on the atmosphere of theconversation as well as the reception. While the vast majority of conversations were eitherpositive or neutral and were all relatively short, there was one negative instance. This was fromKing Falls AM, in which Sammy is outed on the radio in a malicious manner. Though he isshown overwhelming support by his best friend immediately after, and by his friends and othercommunity members in the following episodes, Sammy’s ability to disclose that side of himselfwas taken away from him, and he discusses at length the shame he feels about hiding his39sexuality. The conversation between Sammy and Ben was significantly longer than the otherexamples, lasting about twenty minutes.Lastly, I looked at social media posts made by fans of Welcome to Night Vale, King FallsAM, and The Magnus Archives. The posts, collected from Tumblr and Twitter, showed howimportant visibly queer characters are to fans, especially seeing these characters written in such apositive and normalized light. When considering representation in film and television, manyLGBTQ young adults “stated that these portrayals, however flawed, gave them a sense ofpossibility simply because they were seeing LGBTQ identities depicted” (McInroy and Craig,“Perspectives” 38). In depictions that are much less flawed and one-dimensional, the impact ofqueer characters is even greater. Some fans pointed out that these characters even helped them intheir own queer identity development, supporting the finding that “LGB adults (25-50) reportthat comfort and inspiration received through the media portrayal of role models are particularlyimportant for their identities” (McInroy and Craig, “Perspectives” 35). The shows also gave fansa core around which they have centered queer communities that they struggle to find elsewhere.LimitationsThis analysis is, admittedly, not a complete representation of the audio drama genre noran exhaustive exploration of these podcasts in particular. The seven podcasts I chose to look athave a total of over six hundred episodes combined. Inevitably, there are queer plotlines andcharacters I was not able to include in my analysis, and though I focused on highlighting themost significant queer aspects of each show, I might have overlooked smaller and less positiverepresentations. As well, I chose some of the more popular audio dramas that I knew for certain40had significant queer characters; however, there are still countless other shows with prominentqueer characters that I did not take into consideration or of which I was unaware.Also, since four of the seven shows are still running, I was unable to look at thelong-term progression of queer characters, their plotlines, and their relationships with others overthe span of the show. Though some of the queer relationships in the longer-running shows havedeveloped significantly since the pilot episode, specifically Cecil and Carlos in Welcome to NightVale and Jon and Martin in The Magnus Archives, I was hesitant to make definitive analyses,seeing as how the shows continued to update as I conducted my research. These shows couldalso introduce other significant queer characters in the future as well.The fandoms of these shows are quite extensive. Though I was able to find relevant socialmedia posts for three of the shows, those are merely a glimpse into much deeper and morecomplex online communities. Since I am not immersed in these fandoms, there areinter-community conversations, trends, and phenomena that I was unable to find in my research.Most of the posts I found had tagged the show they mentioned, and I searched for posts usingthese tags — therefore, I missed any posts that did not have the show tagged, which is asignificant amount.Future ResearchThere are several avenues that future researchers can explore regarding sexuality in audiodramas and the value of audio dramas for minority groups and representation, especiallyconsidering how little work has been done on the genre thus far.The most continuous route from the current analysis would be to look into other popularaudio dramas for the queer characters they depict. Some shows include The Penumbra Podcast,41Girl in Space, EOS 10, and even Wolf 359, which all have characters with different sexual andgender identities who vary in prominence to the show’s storyline — for example, The PenumbraPodcast seamlessly includes a host of identities while Wolf 359 has a character offhandedlymention that he is attracted to men in a single sentence and then it is never discussed again.A deep analysis of a single show, rather than an overview of several, would also bebeneficial considering how some audio dramas have anywhere from ten to two hundred episodes.The Magnus Archives follows the format of an anthology for the majority of its nearly twohundred episodes, so the individual stories told could have material for analysis, like the mentionof a same-sex partner, aside from the queerness of its protagonists, Jon and Martin. Delving intomore shows or a specific show can also reveal any less-than-positive instances of queerrepresentation, such as reused plotlines (“coming-out” being the culminating moment for acharacter’s storyline) or stereotypical or one-dimensional characters (like the only non-binarycharacters being non-human).Also, as mentioned in the limitations, the majority of the shows I looked into are stillrunning — analyzing the development of queer relationships over the course of a completedshow would also prove to be enlightening.There is also the phenomenon of characters who are not explicitly stated to be queer butwho the fans imagine being so, either in fan fiction or general discussions online. This process ofmaking “headcanons” — fan interpretations or beliefs that stem from the source material but arenot part of the canon — is encouraged by many audio drama creators. Since what is known abouta character is only disclosed through dialogue and sound effects, fans are only given a finiteamount of canon information about characters, and some creators purposely make theirdescriptions of characters vague to create room for fans’ interpretations. Fans then have the42opportunity to imagine characters in an infinite amount of ways, such as whether the character istransgender, a person of color, or disabled, it also takes away from explicit or implied queerrepresentation. Fans are known to do this with any show, regardless of how many queercharacters are canonically present, so the phenomenon of diversifying the given piece of mediaeven more is worth examining.Audio drama fandoms are very active online and serve as a community for listeners,especially those who are queer. Analyzing fandom dynamics, community structure, and whatfans talk about is sure to be revealing about not only who is listening, but what they take awayfrom the show and deem important. Additionally, most audio drama creators are quite active onsocial media as well and are accessible to fans and possibly future researchers to talk about theirwork, like why they decided to include queer characters in their show and tell their stories insuch ways.ConclusionThough audio dramas are a small part of a growing medium, they are immenselyvaluable, not only for academic purposes but for the people who listen to them. As one Tumblruser aptly and humorously puts it, “podcasts are gay culture” (Another-dead-intern). Thoughblunt, this post points to how podcasts and audio dramas have become a part of “gay culture” formany younger queer people, due in large part to the variety of respectful queer representationthey provide that is hard to find in other media forms. It speaks to how many young queer peopletend to gravitate toward these shows because of their high amount of quality queer characters.The goal of my analysis was to provide an overview of several different elementssurrounding the portrayals of queer characters. Ultimately, these aspects come together to show43how audio dramas are making good and positive representation possible based only on thecreators’ desires to tell meaningful stories — the creators have no monetary incentive to makethese shows and are not guaranteed to gain a massive following, seeing as how most of theshows in this analysis have only a few thousand followers on Twitter. Yet the fans are dedicatedand deeply invested, as some of the social media posts in the last chapter only begin to show.Audio dramas and their significance to queer people are something to keep an eye on.With the rise of the podcast medium also comes the increase in both the number and popularityof independently-created audio dramas. At its core, “Representation is… visibility, and degree ofvisibility tends to reproduce itself in hierarchies of power… those who are relatively powerlessare kept that way through the relative invisibility imposed on them. Systematic efforts to keepthe marginalized invisible amounts to symbolic annihilation” (Drushel 185). The independentaspect of these audio dramas is what seems to set them apart from mass media like television andfilm; without overhead pressure to appeal to the masses in an outdated and heteronormative way,audio dramas are starting to disrupt hierarchies of power that keep queer people at the margins offictional storytelling. Audio dramas are creating growing communities and setting an examplefor the healthy variety of queer representation that is possible. In the wake of the failures oftraditional media, the most popular among these independent shows are setting a precedent ofquality queer characters and narratives that will hopefully be maintained into the future andcause more significant change over time.44BibliographyAleatoryw. “Me: the pilot of welcome to night vale…” 13 July 2019, 12:59 AM,https://aleatoryw.tumblr.com/post/186250569802/me-the-pilot-of-welcome-to-night-vale-fills-me.“Alice Isn't Dead.” Welcome to Night Vale, Night Vale Presents,www.nightvalepresents.com/aliceisntdead.Another-dead-intern. “podcasts are gay culture…” 19 Sep. 2017, 5:52 AM,https://another-dead-intern.tumblr.com/post/165506093916/podcasts-are-gay-culture.“ars PARADOXICA.” The Whisperforge, www.whisperforge.org/arsparadoxica.Bishop, CJ, and Emily Pynoo. “How well are outgroup attitudes and behaviours toward bisexualindividuals measured?

By studying examples of implicit and explicit mentions of sexuality and gender identity, queerness as an integral plot point, and general discussions of sexuality, along with fan responses to these shows and characters on social media, I examine how these representations compare to other media forms, like film and television. I aim to show how these independently created shows offer positive, realistic, and well-rounded queer characters, and how this can be incredibly beneficial to the queer audiences listening",
