The traditional legal architecture of marriagewas built on the assumption of a different-sex couple at its heart, with the roleof each partner heavily shaped by conventional gender norms and the expecta-tion of procreation. As countless others have shown, what once were the socialrealities and legal rules of marriage have been revolutionized, not by gaycouples, but primarily by change in the social and economic roles of women.5The emergence of same-sex-couple relationships continues the need to revisitearlier assumptions. Although only about 3.5% of Americans self-identify aslesbian, gay, or bisexual,6 the absence of a heterosexual pairing in a marriage ormarriage-like relationship dramatizes the contingency of gendered norms in thedomestic and sexual practices that comprise family life. And, at least for themoment, the issue of same-sex marriage is nothing if not drama.Because this piece is written on the occasion of a centennial anniversary, Ibegin by sketching the historical context for patterns of household formationduring the period that coincides with The Journal’s centennial.

Id.1856 [Vol. 100:1855THE GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNALrizes data regarding adult–adult relationships in 1910 and 2010,7 and draws onsocial histories of the early twentieth century to illuminate some of the changesafoot at that time. Parts II and III turn to the central function of the piece, whichis to address the contemporary question posed during the Symposium: what willbe the impact of same-sex marriage?Part II focuses on the social meanings of marriage and on the social andsexual practices that render it distinctive. As an institution, marriage is por-trayed as at once both hegemonic and fragile—rendered a decisive factor morethan a thousand times in federal law alone,8 yet also the subject of countlessreflections on its possible demise. The recognition of same-sex marriage haschanged its legal definition, which once included a husband and a wife as itsconstituent parties. But the change in legal definition so far has been partial,with most states continuing to ban same-sex marriage. The United States islikely to continue for a substantial period of time as a nation with two legaldefinitions of marriage. One effect of that bifurcation will be to test whether andto what extent social as well as legal meanings of marriage will change.For the most part, I leave to others the documentation of the many similaritiesbetween same- and different-sex couples as they decide how to structure theirdomestic living arrangements. Instead I highlight three arenas of private life—household labor, sexual exclusivity, and the choice of whether to have children—for which substantial empirical evidence exists that the patterns of conductbetween the two groups of couples differ. All three of these factors were onceembedded in the law of marriage. None are today, but they continue to affect thecultural norms associated with marriage and thus the process of the constructionof meaning. These factors merit examination because they provide the strongestsupport for arguments that the inclusion of same-sex couples could produce a“new normal” in even a few spousal behaviors and expectations.The legal system is also playing catch up to changes brought about bysame-sex relationships. New marriage laws are the most obvious change but notthe only one. In Part III, I argue that recognition of same-sex couple relation-ships has caused two major additional changes in family law already and willlikely directly or indirectly produce further significant change. State legislatureshave created new legal status categories for partner relationships, and bothstatutory and case law changes have led to the recognition that a child’s twoparents can be of the same sex. For the future, I identify three family-lawcontexts in which changes linked to same-sex marriage seem most likely: newmechanisms for the regulation of different-sex couple relationships, the impact7. Although there is a massive body of literature analyzing the effects of various adult-partnerhousehold forms on children, that subject is beyond the scope of what I address here. Similarly, thispiece discusses only same-sex relationship issues as they have arisen in the United States.8. For the most recent compilation, see Letter from Dayna K. Shah, Assoc. Gen.

As today’s overheated arguments over same-sexmarriage cool, it is my hope that advocates on both sides will realize the richpotential for new knowledge that can come from studying whatever effects thisstill “incomplete institution”9 eventually has (or does not have) on Americanculture and law. I conclude with a call for agnostic empiricism as developmentsin gay and lesbian family law continue to influence how law regulates all familystructures.I. GETTING FROM THERE TO HEREOne hundred years ago, American law accepted that different-sex marriageremained an institution headed by the husband10 and that it was the exclusivevenue for lawful and legitimate sexuality.11 The Supreme Court triggered nolegal or popular revolt when it rhapsodized marriage as “the sure foundation ofall that is stable and noble in our civilization; the best guaranty of that reverentmorality which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and politicalimprovement.”12 But developments that were as provocative then as same-sexmarriage is now were beginning to surface on the cultural landscape.A snapshot of data from 1910 illuminates the prevalent patterns up to thattime.13 Americans, especially women, married at much younger ages than theydo now, and both women and men remained married. Of persons between theages of fifteen and nineteen, 11% of women (but only 1% of men) had married;by the age of twenty-four, half of women and a quarter of men had married.14Of all Americans fifteen and older, 55.8% of men and 58.9% of women were9. Sociologist Andrew Cherlin used this phrase thirty-four years ago to describe remarriage. SeeAndrew Cherlin, Remarriage as an Incomplete Institution, 84 AMER. J. SOCIOL. 634 (1978). Cherlinargued that remarriage lacked a full repertoire of individual and group customs and social supportstructures, in contrast to first marriages. He saw the latter as being highly institutionalized, by which hemeant that family members “rely on a wide range of habitualized behaviors to assist them in solving thecommon problems of family life. We take these behavioral patterns for granted until their absenceforces us to create solutions on our own.” Id. at 636–37.10. See, for example, Thompson v. Thompson, 218 U.S. 611, 618 (1911), in which the SupremeCourt construed a statute granting married women the right to bring suit without the participation oftheir husbands to be insufficient grounds for allowing a woman to sue her husband for physical assault,declining to infer that the legislature intended to bring about “radical changes in the policy of centuries”without explicit language so stating.11. The husband held the “exclusive right to marital intercourse with his wife.” Tinker v. Colwell,193 U.S. 473, 484 (1904) (holding that a husband’s claim for criminal conversation qualified as aninjury to his personal rights and property and thus his damages award was not dischargeable inbankruptcy).12.

They describe theperiod from 1910 to 1920 as one of enormous social ferment, manifest in partby the beginnings of a revolution in gender roles and in sexual practices outsidemarriage.17 According to John D’Emilio and Estelle Freedman, two changes inAmerican society at the turn of the twentieth century “stand out as emblematicof this new sexual order: the redefinition of womanhood to include eroticismand the decline of public reticence about sex.”18 Young single women enteredthe paid workforce as never before, where they played a critical role inconstituting a new urban sexual culture, shaped by a growing commercializationof pleasure, sexualized public spaces such as dance halls, and the influence ofthe sexual and social practices brought to the United States by waves ofimmigration.19These visible challenges to traditional morality triggered a commensuratereaction: between 1910 and 1915, local governments in thirty-five cities createdvice commissions, primarily to study strategies to curb prostitution.20 A lessvisible challenge—a steadily rising divorce rate—had already begun.21 Thenumber of divorces per thousand marriages increased each decade from 1870 to1950, but by far the largest single jump—seventy percent—occurred between1910 and 1920.22 Although not evident in the pages of a law review, there was aculture war over sexual mores underway when The Journal began publication.Historians have also alerted us to the emergence roughly a century ago of “asexual minority of sorts . . . in the making.”23 In 1911, vice investigators in15.

Marriage occurs at later ages than it did in 1910,29 andit is usually preceded, and often followed, by cohabitation.30 In the 2010snapshot, 51.3% of Americans aged fifteen and older were married, and 11.1%were either divorced or separated.31 Of American women in the prime marryingages of twenty-five to forty-four, more than 40% were either divorced (13%),cohabiting (11%), or single (18%).32 The number of unmarried-partner house-holds increased 41% between 2000 and 2010, four times greater than the 10%overall increase in household population.33 Unmarried different-sex partnerscomprised 4.6% of all households in 2000, rising to 5.9% of the total in 2010.34The typical lock-step life sequence in 1910 of single to married and possiblyto widowed, has diffused into a starburst pattern of stages moving from singleto cohabiting to married and often to divorced, frequently followed by a newround of unpartnered to cohabiting and possibly to remarried.35 The centralityof marriage has diminished, rendering it the most popular—but not the only—24.

Lesbians are morelikely than gay men to marry or enter into another formal legal status.44Marriage holds significantly more appeal for same-sex couples than do otherstatuses. Same-sex couples are more likely to marry in the first year aftermarriage is open to them than they are to enter into other status categories in thefirst year after those become available.45 In states where same-sex marriage has36. It is challenging to report data on relationship patterns in the United States in a way thataccurately captures a complex reality. For example, as media reports have hyped, the marriage rate isnow at an historic low. See Stevenson & Wolfers, supra note 21, at 29. It is also true, however, that thedivorce rate peaked more than thirty years ago, and is now lower than it has been since 1970.

An article by alumnusNancy Polikoff on lesbian-mother families became one of the most influentialpieces in the history of The Journal, having been cited more than four-hundredtimes, including in more than a dozen judicial opinions.47 Writing from adistinctly different philosophical perspective, Stephen Macedo sought to build aconservative “reasoned, public, secular” argument against equality for gaypeople, including in the realm of domestic partnerships and marriage.48 Afterexamining these arguments, he concluded that there is no persuasive basis fordiscrimination.49 If there is a theme to the articles on LGBT rights published inThe Journal, it is that of serious engagement with the moral and philosophicalprinciples being contested.50Bringing The Journal’s tradition up to date, Professor William Eskridgeoffers in this Issue an important new analysis of how family law has evolvedduring the preceding century.51 Professor Eskridge points out that the manyreforms of the last century have had simultaneously deregulatory and regulatoryeffects on family law. He identifies the negative push behind those changes asbeing away from mandatory, monopolistic laws, centered on marriage anddesigned to advance the natural-law goal of instantiating the marital, procre-ative, heterosexual family as the only legitimate model. The pull forward, andthe new model he proffers for analyzing family law, is toward a quasi-contractual regime of few mandates but many nudges, embedded in a system ofdefault rules and opportunities for override of rules if the parties so desire. Thisframework accommodates a matter-of-fact understanding that social and eco-nomic changes lead to alterations in the legal structures for domestic arrange-ments, implicitly rejecting a naturalized definition of marriage. Let’s de-escalatethe rhetoric surrounding same-sex marriage, he suggests, and experiment morecreatively with some of the options open to us in a guided-choice world.46.

Mygreatest caution is that the evolutionary process that he describes is far fromover. The emerging contours that Professor Eskridge outlines may change inany of a number of directions in far less time than it will take The GeorgetownLaw Journal to celebrate its bicentennial.II. CHANGE AND CONVERGENCEThe point noted earlier as currently in popular dispute—will lesbians and gaymen change marriage or join it—is actually an old question, or rather an old setof questions. Will the new group modify the norms and practices associatedwith a long-standing institution? Or will the dominant meanings linked to theinstitution and the experience of being married efface the distinctive practices ofthe group formerly excluded from it? Perhaps there will be a selection effect:those individuals most likely to marry will be those with the strongest desire toparticipate in the cluster of norms and practices associated with the traditions ofmarriage. And there is the simple numerical reality to consider: if everysame-sex couple in the United States married tomorrow, they would constituteone percent of all marriages.52 How much effect on social meanings could sucha small group have?53An obvious threshold question in this debate is whether same-sex coupleswill marry at the same rate as others.54 At present, slightly less than seventypercent of the adult population has been married at some point in their lives.55Among Americans sixty-five and older, more than ninety-five percent have beenmarried.56 To date, only seven jurisdictions (not necessarily representative ofthe U.S. population at large) offer marriage to same-sex couples, and in nolocation has it been available for even ten years.57 In Massachusetts, where therate of marriage for same-sex couples is highest, experts estimate that thesame-sex-couple marriage rate will equal the rate for different-sex couples inthe near future.5852.

See id. at 2.2012] 1863FUTURE IMPACT OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGEDespite increasing research on lesbian and gay relationships, however, muchis still unknown. During what has become the typical contemporary life cycle,individuals experience multiple stages of singleness, cohabitation, marriage orstatus registration, divorce or dissolution, and re-partnering. Americans engagein a “complex selection process into and out of distinct relationship states. Oneshould be careful not to interpret these different states as steps in a ‘progression’in relationship formation from single to dating, cohabitation, and formal recogni-tion akin to marriage.”59 We do not yet have enough data to know whether andto what extent the proportions of lesbian and gay couples in each of thesestages, or the duration and sequencing of the stages, will differ from population-wide averages.When same-sex partners do marry, will those marriages differ in significantways from those of different-sex partners? I argued in 1991 that legalization ofsame-sex marriage has the potential to “disrupt both the gendered definition ofmarriage and the assumption that marriage is a form of socially, if not legally,prescribed hierarchy” and to “destabilize the cultural meaning of marriage.”60Some opponents of gay marriage have echoed similar speculations, albeit withalarm,61 while some supporters of LGBT equality have criticized my view asunderestimating the homogenizing power of marriage.62 Twenty years later,what does the evidence show?My argument was not that heterosexual marriage would suddenly be trans-formed but that both in law and culture, the appearance of same-sex coupleswithin the category of marriage would, along with the history of changeswrought by the women’s movement, present a visible challenge to the mosttraditional gender norms associated with marriage. As I pointed out, the gen-dered definitions in the law of marriage had already all disappeared except forthe last one: that the two spouses had to be of different sexes.63Since then, the actual de-gendering of family law has been more substantialthan the explication of rationales for that outcome. In addition to ending thedifferent-sex limitation on marriage, some jurisdictions have also eliminated therequirement that a child’s parents must be of different sexes, an at least equallysubstantial de-gendering of family law.64 And some judges have ventured intothe realm of gender analysis, an exercise distinct from Equal Protection formal-59.

Like any social institution, the meaning of marriageis constructed by a meld of behaviors and understandings of what thosebehaviors mean. As one anthropologist has noted, “[m]arriage . . . is both some-thing people do and something they think . . . .”67 The New Jersey SupremeCourt found it self evident that because “the shared societal meaning ofmarriage . . . has always been the union of a man and a woman[, t]o alter thatmeaning would render a profound change in the public consciousness of asocial institution of ancient origin.”68 Whatever the truth contained in thatstatement, it is also true that if marriage functions as a performance of socialmeaning, it is one in which every actor’s script is continuously changing.We see evidence of this ongoing change when we examine the types of lifebehaviors for which social-science research has found significant differencesbetween different- and same-sex couples.69 The three best-documented ex-amples involve division of household labor, sexual exclusivity, and child rear-ing. All three were once associated with the legal definition of marriage, buttoday none of them have legal relevance.70 Yet to some extent, they continue toresonate with social meanings of marriage. Underlying all three are echoes ofthe impact of gender—the gender differentiation in different-sex marriage andits uncertain role in gay relationships. And in all three, there are at least some65. My argument had to do with the evolution of gender discourse, not with whether a sex-discrimination claim would be the ground for the decision in a case challenging marriage exclusions.For a review of how courts have handled the Equal Protection doctrine in gay-marriage cases, seeClifford J. Rosky, Perry v. Schwarzenegger and the Future of Same-Sex Marriage Law, 53 ARIZ. L. REV.913, 920–42 (2011).66.

For example, Charlotte Patterson notes that studies of same-sex couples in Vermont found thatsexual orientation was related to many more aspects of experience than the individual’s status asregistered or not as part of a civil union. Examples for when sexual orientation, regardless ofcivil-union status, differentiated gay from sibling heterosexual couples included duration of relation-ship, number of children, and characterization of religious beliefs.

The division-of-household-labor gap isdecreasing between different- and same-sex couples, but versions of that patternexist in both groups.75 In an ethnographic study of fifty-two gay and lesbiancouples in the San Francisco Bay area, sociologist Christopher Carrington foundthat one person “specialize[d] in domesticity” in seventy-five percent of thecouples, and that the tendency to specialize increased with the length of therelationship.76 Carrington, who did not compare his sample with different-sexcouples, concluded that gay families were reacting to the broader economic71.

Conversely, different-sex couples have responded to theeconomic pressure to have two income earners in the household (as well as toindividual pressure from the female partner) by mitigating the amount ofdomestic labor once assumed almost entirely by the (often stay-at-home) wife.Husbands, who typically earn the higher income, now do a greater share ofhousehold work than before, although seldom an equal share.78In the second area of difference, a large volume of research indicates thatthere is a significant divergence from the norm by gay male partners in practicesrelated to sexual exclusivity. Gay male relationships have tended to be distinc-tive in two respects. First, male partners report that monogamy has less impor-tance in their relationships and that openness to other sexual partners is oftennegotiated within the couple.79 Second, gay male relationships tend to lastlonger than those of lesbian partners.80 There is some indication in recent datathat monogamy between male partners has increased relative to different-sex orlesbian couples.81 It is unclear whether the newer data reflect a reaction to therisk of HIV infection, a permanent shift in behavior, or characteristics of thestudy sample.82 Even with this change, there is still a significant, althoughperhaps declining, difference between the frequency of enduring open relation-ships in gay male couples compared to other couples.83Lastly, another major marker of difference between gay and straight relation-ships pertains to children. A large majority of heterosexual couples have chil-dren, but only about one in six same-sex couples raise children.84 The decisionto marry is often associated with the decision to become parents.85 At least at77.

If the overall trend away from child raising contin-ues, it may signal a de-heteronormalization effect, in which individuals who feltsocial pressure to become parents while in a heterosexual marriage can moreeasily discount that pressure once they adopt a lesbian or gay social identity.The downward shift in child-raising among lesbians and gay men also har-monizes with a trend of fewer heterosexuals becoming parents87 and a trend ofdiminishing stigma associated with childlessness.88 Again, there may be some-thing of a convergence occurring. In the lesbian-and-gay group in which parent-hood is much less common than the norm, more couples are likely to marry. Inthe (far larger) heterosexual group, more married couples may opt not to havechildren. Overall, the traditional conflation of marriage and children may weaken.In making the decision whether to have children, race appears to be a moresalient factor than sexual orientation. In the population as a whole, householdsin which one or both adults are a racial or ethnic minority are more likely toinclude children.89 Similarly, same-sex couples in which at least one individualis a person of color are substantially more likely than white same-sex couples tobe raising a child: African-Americans are 2.4 times more likely and Latinos andLatinas are 1.7 times more likely to be in parenting households.90 Future trendsin childbearing among persons of color, rather than among gay and lesbiancouples, may better predict the percentage of same-sex couples who decide toraise children.91In sum, these are the clusters of marriage-related behaviors—domestic work,sex, and procreation—where one will find whatever significant differences, ifany, exist between gay and straight couples. In each, the stringent rules, normsand expectations that have traditionally governed marriage between a man and awoman are weakening, creating the opening for, among other things, theinfluence of other forms.

For both gay andstraight couples, the decision to marry has become more complex and issometimes made when other options are possible. Whether to marry has becomethe kind of question that gay and straight friends discuss as a shared concern.Those same friends will continue to discuss how to navigate the decisions thatcouples make, such as whether to have children. From individual conversationsto representations in the media, cultures—even large ones—are influenced byother cultures—even small ones. Norms for family-life structures, like all othernorms, evolve.In addition, as long as same-sex marriage remains a political hot-button issue,gay couples will be the subjects of much greater social visibility than theirnumbers would suggest. That cultural overexposure, ironically, will enhance theextent to which norms with a stronger association to same-sex than to different-sex partners will become more widespread.In sum, the growing number of same-sex married couples will create theopportunity to study from a fresh perspective many of the questions that havebeen most important to scholars of family life, including:• Issues related to the variety of family forms in American life: Who willdecide to marry (or register or cohabit or remarry) and why? Who willdecide to have children and why? Will marriage patterns for lesbians andgay men of color more closely track those of other persons of color94 thanthose of other lesbians and gay men? Who will decide to divorce and why?Will the presence of different levels of regulation in different states alignwith greater or lesser rates of dissolution for certain legal statuses?• Issues related to the effects of economic change on family formation: Willchanges in the economy produce the same movements up or down inmarriage, cohabitation, and divorce rates among same- and different-sexcouples?95 If not, why? Will marriage occur with greater frequency forsame-sex couples with higher education and income levels, as is now thecase for different-sex couples?96 If not, why?92. See Andrew J.

Will different-sex and same-sex couples develop shared patterns of household-labordivision? Will marriage be perceived as one of two types: not gay orstraight, but with or without children?For all of these questions, intellectually honest scholars must be willing tofollow wherever the research leads, regardless of whether the findings appear tocast same-sex marriage in a warm glow of tradition or to suggest the persistenceof less popular differentiations or to take the analysis in new and unforeseendirections. If, as I suspect, gay couples over time will both assimilate to andchange the social meanings of marriage, the knowledge that we will gain frombetter understanding the linkages between relationship patterns, gender, sexual-ity, and race will prove far more important than today’s anxieties about exactlyhow these new dynamics can be portrayed by one side or another in short-termmedia strategies.III. LEGAL QUESTIONS FOR THE FUTUREIn considering the prospect of legal change, the beginning point is to acknowl-edge that regardless of the ultimate fate of same-sex marriage as a nationallyrecognized status, lesbian and gay Americans have already changed family lawin multiple ways. Two developments stand out as the most significant for legaldoctrine.First, adult partners seeking legal recognition have fueled the creation of newlegal statuses. States have created both marriage equivalents, in which the newstatus carries all or virtually all the material incidents of marriage, lacking onlythe name,97 and marriage alternatives, which include significantly fewer mar-riage-like rights and responsibilities.98 The extent to which these categoriescontinue after same-sex couples gain access to marriage will depend on whethera sufficient demand for them exists from both gay and straight couples who donot want to marry.Second, parenting law has expanded to recognize that both of a child’s twolegal parents can be of the same sex. The former universal rule was that onlyone partner in a same-sex couple could adopt children because there could beonly one mother or one father.99 Today, that rule has been replaced in many97. California, Delaware, the District of Columbia (in addition to marriage), Hawaii, Illinois,Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington have all created marriage equivalents.Badgett & Herman, supra note 42, at 3. In addition, litigation is pending in the Montana Supreme Courtthat seeks access to the tangible benefits of marriage for same-sex couples. Notice of Appeal,Donaldson v. Montana, No. DA 11-0451 (Mont. July 22, 2010).98. Colorado, Hawaii (in addition to a marriage equivalent), Maine, Maryland, Vermont (in additionto marriage), and Wisconsin have all created marriage alternatives. Badgett & Herman, supra note 42,at 3.99. Polikoff, supra note 47, at 468–69.1870 [Vol. 100:1855THE GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNALstates by a policy of allowing two persons of the same sex to adopt.100Similarly, when a child is born to one partner in a same sex marriage or otherregistered relationship, marriage-equivalent laws often provide that both same-sex partners will be listed as the two parents on the birth certificate.101In thirteen states plus the District of Columbia, the law has taken both ofthese steps away from traditional family law. In these states, the law bothrecognizes either marriage or a marriage equivalent for same-sex couples andallows a gay or lesbian couple to adopt a child together as the two parents.102One-third of the U.S. population lives in these fourteen jurisdictions,103 whichcollectively comprise a culturally and legally distinct family-law regime forsame-sex couples.Predicting the next set of important legal changes is hazardous. For thefuture, ongoing evolution almost certainly is the only reliable forecast aboutsame-sex marriage, family law, and the relationship between them. In that spirit,I pose three sets of questions to consider as the legal structures continue tochange. Each question is addressed in its own subsection below.A. HOW WILL THE EMERGENCE OF A PLURALIST MENU OF RELATIONSHIP-STATUSCATEGORIES AFFECT REGULATION OF DIFFERENT-SEX PARTNERSHIPS?The legal regulation of unmarried-couple households is quite complex. Legalissues arising from unmarried different-sex partners led to the first steps towardincorporating nonmarital households into family law. Same-sex couples thenbegan to invoke that body of case law in an attempt to secure rights andremedies for gay and lesbian families. The next major developments mayinvolve a migration of legal concepts in the opposite direction if different-sexcouples become a significant component of those who utilize new legal statusescreated primarily for gay couples.Different-sex partner cohabitation has become a standard household form. Ofall Americans between thirty and forty-nine years old, fifty-seven percent havecohabited with a partner.104 Professor Eskridge argues that cohabitation has alsobecome a coherent legal regime, citing the emergence of common law prin-ciples recognizing nonmarital relationships, especially in contract, property andtort law.105 However, a complete picture of the legal landscape requires acknowl-100. See WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE, JR. & NAN D. HUNTER, SEXUALITY, GENDER, AND THE LAW 1143–44 (3ded. 2011) (noting that eighteen states and the District of Columbia explicitly allow second-parentadoption by a same-sex partner).101. See Nancy D.

Eskridge, supra note 51, at 1924–35.2012] 1871FUTURE IMPACT OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGEedging that the story has at least one other subplot, which is the rise and fall ofcommon law marriage.In a common law marriage regime, the law imposes the same rules associatedwith formal marriage on the two parties upon a showing that they held them-selves out to be spouses during the relationship.106 It is neither a marriageequivalent nor a marriage alternative; rather, it is a form of marriage. CynthiaGrant Bowman, the most prominent scholar of common law marriage, arguesthat the move away from its recognition since the late nineteenth century hasdeprived the weaker party in such unions—usually the woman—of importantprotections.107 A series of reasons contributed to many states terminating theofficial status of common law marriage: a concern with fraudulent claims,worries over administrative burdens from having to adjudicate what was the“true” marriage, class and racial prejudice against African-Americans and lowerincome persons with whom common law marriage was associated, and worriesthat allowing informal ties to convey official legal standing would weaken thestatus and sanctity of marriage.108 Bowman argues that the cluster of case lawremedies is inadequate to provide comparable protection because explicit con-tracts are infrequent and remedies inadequate.109Both common law marriage and the case law that began with Marvin v.Marvin110 originated in claims presented by heterosexual partners. By contrast,the formalized status categories of domestic partner and civil union grew out ofdemands for recognition by same-sex couples, often in the wake of courts’rejections of the same kinds of tort or property claims that had begun to beaccepted when pressed by unmarried heterosexual partners.111For different-sex couples, access to the menu of marriage-equivalent andmarriage-alternative relationship options that have emerged from LGBT-equality claims varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Ten states and theDistrict of Columbia still permit common law marriage.112 Four jurisdictionsallow both different- and same-sex couples to opt for a nonmarital status.113 Intwo others, different-sex couples can obtain the nonmarital status only if onepartner is above a certain age.114 In the remainder of states, different-sexcouples are allowed to register their relationship only as a marriage.

The most significant differences be-tween cohabitation and marriage-alternative statutes concern termination of thestatus. If a cohabiting couple satisfies the indicia for the imposition of aconstructive contract, neither of the parties can simply opt out of his or herduties. In addition, cohabitation regimes do not include formal dissolution, aprocess which exists in codified alternatives.One irony of the coexistence of the body of case law applying to cohabitationwith the enactment of new formal statuses is that the former constructivelyenforces many of the rules and norms of the latter. In California, for example, adifferent-sex cohabitant may be entitled to pursue certain claims under Marvinand its progeny even if she does not qualify for or has intentionally elected notto take part in the registered domestic-partnership scheme. Although only asmall number of different-sex partners choose to enter into formalized nonmari-tal statuses that are open to them, millions engage in cohabitation, a fact thattriggers a body of applicable law of which they may not even be aware.The fastest growing segments of cohabiting different-sex couples are thosemiddle-aged or older. There are more unmarried partners between the ages of 30and 44 than between 18 and 29, and almost as many 45 and older as there are inthe 18-to-29 age group.117 In the majority of cohabiting couples, one or bothpartners have previously been married.118 Almost one in five American womenbetween the ages of 40 and 44 are in cohabiting couples after having beenmarried.119 These numbers help explain the demand for a nonmarital statusopen to different-sex couples older than the typical premarriage-age cohorts.120Very little data exists as to the demand by different-sex couples for participa-tion in formal registration systems. In Washington, where different-sex couplesmay register as domestic partners only if at least one partner is 62 or older,forty-five percent of the couples in that age category who registered from 2007115.

Between May and November2008 in California, when same-sex couples were allowed to marry, between 292and 386 persons a month opted to enter the registered-domestic-partner sys-tem.124 The data do not indicate the numerical breakdown between heterosexualcouples and same-sex couples. However, even if the take-up rate continued tobe approximately 170 couples per month, or roughly 2,000 couples per year,that is a small number relative to the population of California.If one is analyzing the preferences of different-sex couples, the data so farindicate a very strong preference for marriage over alternative-status categories.If one is analyzing the composition of the group of people who elect a nonmari-tal status, it appears that, at least in some locations, a significant portion consistsof different-sex couples.Will we start to see more formal “postmarriage unions” tailored to theconcerns of persons who have children or property from prior marriages?Would adoption of such laws create a new relationship status defined not onlyby age but also effectively by socio-economic status? What set of legal rightsand responsibilities would such laws entail? Will AARP become a major playerwhen state legislatures consider nonmarital status laws?125 Will the culturaltrend to specialization and narrow casting dominate family law? Will differentstates with different demographic profiles enact other niche relationship laws?An increase in the number of jurisdictions offering more formal legal recogni-tion of nonmarital different-sex relationships would be consistent with thebroader trend toward greater variety in the patterns and norms of Americanfamily life. It would also have a major impact on family law.126121. Badgett & Herman, supra note 42, at 30.122.

WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT ON FAMILY LAW AND ON LGBT FAMILIES WHENFEDERAL AGENCIES BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE?The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) prohibits the federal governmentfrom “giving effect to” marriages between same-sex partners.127 The statute isunder significant attack in court,128 and the Department of Justice has stated itsopinion that DOMA is unconstitutional.129 Although it is impossible to knowwhether or when DOMA will be invalidated or repealed, I will assume forpurposes of this article that the end of DOMA will occur before same-sexcouples acquire the right to marry under state law throughout the United States.The marriage-equality movement has created what amounts to a naturalexperiment testing the extent to which a stigmatized group that has been barredfrom marriage will seek to participate in marriage when that status becomesopen to them. The point at which same-sex couples can acquire all of the federallaw incidents of marriage will be one moment when a significant change couldoccur in the patterns and rates of same-sex couples who marry. One possibilityis that, because of the extent and importance of federal benefits,130 a largenumber of couples who have so far decided not to marry will change theirminds when DOMA ends.Social science research indicates that different- and same-sex couples identifyvirtually the same mix of reasons behind the desire to marry.131 For bothgroups, however, the only data come from self reports, which could be influ-enced by respondents’ desire to provide what they believe to be the mostsocially acceptable answers. If there is a surge in the number of same-sexcouples who marry once federal recognition is available, it would signal thataccess to material benefits is more critical to the decision than indicated bysurvey responses. Alternatively, the absence of a surge in the numbers wouldprovide stronger evidence that material incentives are less important than other127. 1 U.S.C. § 7 (1996).128.

Perhapsrecognition at the national level, even if not controlling the policy of any state,would be perceived as a more powerful signal of legitimacy and acceptancethan equality under state marriage law.133 There is also evidence that theceremonial aspects of a wedding can affect the psychological dimension of thecouple’s relationship as well as the social recognition and support provided tothem, even if it has no legal consequence and even if—perhaps especiallyif—the couple has appropriated traditional forms in gay-identified ways.134 Theend of DOMA could provide a unique opportunity to investigate what relation-ship, if any, exists between change in marriage law and the emotional health ofthe couples who decide to marry versus those who decide not to marry.Although the end of DOMA will produce one nationwide policy—federalagencies will apply the same standard to same-sex as to different-sex mar-riages—it remains unclear precisely what that standard will be. Federal agenciesdefer to the states for determining the validity of a marriage. But it is an openquestion whether federal recognition will attach only to the marriages of gayand lesbian couples whose state of residence recognizes their marriage, orwhether federal agencies will also recognize marriages that were legal whereperformed.135 This question will have enormous practical impact, since sixtypercent of the same-sex couples who have married have been nonresidents ofthe jurisdiction where the marriage occurred.136Whatever policy option the federal government chooses, the post-DOMAfamily law landscape for gay and lesbian families is likely to become even moreincoherent than it is now. A local couple who married in Massachusetts, forexample, would be considered married under both federal and state law, but thatrecognition could easily change if they moved to any of more than forty states.Once relocated, some gay married couples have found that the courts of theirnew state of residence will not recognize their marriage, even in order to grant a132.

Same-sex marriage re-introduces substantial disarray inthat aspect of family law. The complexity surrounding this issue will heightenafter federal recognition begins, and the result will increasingly bedevil localjudges and practitioners, among others. Inevitably, national uniformity will haveto be restored with state and federal jurisdictions following the same definitionalrules, a process that could drag on for years.C. WILL PARENTHOOD BECOME THE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN REGULATORYREGIMES OF MORE VERSUS LESS STRINGENCY?The hedonic norm values that Professor Eskridge asserts as the foundation forcontemporary family law are least persuasive when they conflict with theimperative to protect vulnerable or dependent persons in the family. A series ofappellate courts have ruled, consistent with this intuition but nonetheless irratio-nally, that the risk of “accidental procreation” by different-sex partners justifiesthe exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage (including those with chil-dren) on the theory that “an important function of marriage is to create morestability and permanence in the relationships that cause children to be born[by] . . . offer[ing] an inducement . . . to opposite-sex couples.”138 However in-apt this risk is as the rationale for an exclusion, the goal of maximizing familystability once children are born is legitimate.Given the strength of the assumption that marriage is the best path tostability, it is notable that legislators have not enacted laws with expandablemarriage duties for couples who become parents. Such laws could automaticallyenhance the obligations of the adult partners after children are born or adopted,for example, whereas marriages without children (whether of same- or different-sex partners) would be subject to looser rules as to property division and othermatters. For any marriage during which a child was born or adopted, the lawcould expand the duties of former spouses to each other, linked somewhat to thedivision of custody and visitation but primarily calculated to produce equivalentlevels of resources for the children, regardless of with which spouse they wereliving.If the repeated references to the potential harms of accidental procreation thatappear in same-sex-marriage case law are taken seriously, the development ofnew status categories targeted to providing greater protection for children by thecreation of stronger legal bonds between their parents would seem to merit137. See, e.g., Chambers v. Ormiston, 935 A.2d 956 (R.I. 2007) (finding no jurisdiction to adjudicatedivorce of couple whose marriage was legal in state where performed); In re Marriage of J.B. & H.B.,326 S.W.3d 654 (Tex.

So far as I am aware, however, no such proposal is beforeany lawmaking body.The American Law Institute published a set of principles ten years ago underwhich unmarried couples would be made subject to mandatory, marriage-likerules for property distribution and family support if they had lived together for aspecific number of years established by state law or if they had had a child.139The ALI proposal, however, covers only cohabiting couples and it can betriggered by a durational test as much as by the addition of a child to the familyunit. No jurisdiction has enacted it.140The closest thing to such a status actually in existence today is covenantmarriage, which makes divorce more difficult but is unrelated to the presence ofchildren.141 Additional family-support obligations tied to a parenting marriagecategory would be more stringently regulatory than covenant marriage in tworespects. First, although the prospect of enhanced support obligations mightdissuade two parents from divorcing in the same way that covenant marriage isintended to do, the tougher regulatory mechanism would not terminate if adivorce did occur, unlike with covenant marriage. Its goal would not be toprevent divorce but to enhance the well-being of children in postmarital house-holds. Second, the distinctive legal aspects of a parenting marriage would attachautomatically upon the birth or adoption of a child rather than only when thespouses opt in, as occurs in covenant marriage.My purpose here is not to endorse or advocate for such an approach. Oneenormous shortcoming is that it would heighten the privatization of child-welfare costs and thereby provide little value to children in families with lessavailable income. My preferred policy choice would be to rely primarily on anallocation of resources to children independent of their parents’ marital status. Ioffer it for policymakers who prioritize maintaining the marriage–child-rearinglink. If the concern with child welfare that forms a recurring theme in marriage-equality debates is genuine, a tighter marriage bond for parents, if not by a newformal status then by incremental case law modifications to current support law,should be under consideration. The absence of support for this kind of approachis telling.CONCLUSIONSame-sex marriage is a new family form that seems destined to gain increas-ing legal and social acceptance. Same-sex marriage and marriage alternativeswill both produce more change in family law and continue to reflect underlyingshifts in gender norms and social practices across the population.

    "abstract": "Same-sex relationships have already significantly altered family law, by leading to new formal relationship statuses and incorporation of the principle that both of a child’s legal parents can be of the same sex. This essay explores further changes that may lie ahead as same-sex marriage debates increasingly affect both family law and the social meanings of marriage. Marriage as an institution has changed most dramatically because of the cumulative effects of the last half-century of de-gendering family law. Same-sex marriage–and perhaps even more so, the highly visible cultural debate over it–is contributing to this process.\nThe author argues that the greatest potential for changes in social meaning will arise in three areas for which there is empirical evidence of significant differences between gay and straight couples: division of household labor, sexual exclusivity, and childrearing. In each, although recent data indicate some signs of converging behaviors between the two types of couples, major differences appear likely to continue. While the number of same-sex couples in the population is too small to produce significant change in overall patterns of behavior, the issue of gay marriage has generated so much attention and debate that a mixed process of gay assimilation to and effect on the social meaning of marriage is a reasonable expectation.\nAs to future legal change, the author identifies three questions likely to arise in the relatively near future that will flow, directly or indirectly, from same-sex marriage:\nFirst, we may see an increasing uptake by different-sex couples of marriage equivalent and marriage alternative statuses (e.g., domestic partnerships) that have grown out of LGBT rights efforts. If present demographic trends continue, the group of different-sex couples most likely to seek access to these new statuses will be persons middle-aged or older.\nSecond, federal recognition of same-sex marriage, which will occur if the Defense of Marriage Act is invalidated or repealed, could significantly increase the number of same-sex couples who marry. The end of DOMA is also likely to further complicate the law of interstate recognition, as more gay couples have their marriages recognized for federal law purposes, such as tax, but not under state laws that regulate divorce, custody and property division. Since 60 per cent of same-sex marriages are performed for out-of-state residents, the complexity of federal-state conflict regarding recognition of particular marriages is likely to increase dramatically.\nLastly, the author questions whether the issue of “accidental procreation” that has become a theme in court decisions related to same-sex marriage may migrate to marriage law more generally. In particular, she suggests that a more stringent set of rules expanding support obligations in marriages (whether of different- or same-sex spouses) in which children are born or adopted would better serve the purposes advanced by social conservatives who purport to argue on behalf of children’s welfare",
