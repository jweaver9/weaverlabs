This is largely due to the stigma and social consequences \nof outwardly identifying as a sexual minority.  However, some sexual minority \nindividuals experience protective factors that bolster social support during adolescence, \nwhich may act as a buffer against the effects of stigma leading to more positive health \nand psychological outcomes in adulthood.  Both adolescent risk factors and protective \nfactors in sexual minority individuals may contribute to professional success and \nachievement in adult life vis-à-vis their resultant psychological and health outcomes.  As \nsexual minority individuals in adolescence tend to experience risk and protective factors \ndifferently from their straight counterparts, the same may also be true for individuals \nattending graduate school.  Certain protective factors in adolescence may be commonly \nexperienced for individuals who end up attending graduate school.  Very little empirical \nresearch has been conducted to examine the differential experiences during adolescence \nwith regard to protective factors and sexual minority identification in graduate students.  \nThis paper focuses on the impact that protective factors during adolescence may \ncontribute to graduate school as an outcome for sexual minority individuals.  Specifically, \nfamily support, social support, ego identity, personal psychological resources, and \nacceptance are considered.  Areas of future research are also discussed. \n \n Keywords: lgbt, sexual minorities, risk factors, protective factors  \n  iii \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n I would like to thank, first and foremost, the activists and citizens who continue \non a daily basis to fight for equality and recognition for queer and sexual minority \nindividuals across our society.  Without their efforts, research into issues relevant to \nsexual minorities may not even be possible.  Additionally, my supervisor, Dr. Jane M. \nTram, was very supportive and offered invaluable guidance as I navigated the process of \ncompleting this research.  I greatly appreciate her understanding and flexibility along \nwith her clarity of expectations and, from time to time, her encouragement to strive \nharder for the next goal.  I am also grateful for the support of my research team, Brita J. \nFosse, M.S., Jessica M. Andrews, M.S., and Jade Kost, M.S, who provided assistance, \npointers, and advice as I waded through my research project.  Finally, I would like to \nthank my friends and colleagues Susan Glinka, B.A., and Katherine Lewis, B.S., for \nsupporting me emotionally and socially throughout this challenging process. Without the \nconvergence of all of these individuals’ efforts, this project would not have been \ncompleted.  \n  iv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nAbstract……………………………………………………………………………………. ii \nAcknowledgments…………………………………………………………………………. iii \nTable of Contents………………………………………………………………………….. iv \nIntroduction………………………………………………………………………………… 1 \nPurpose…………………………………………………………………………………….. 2 \nDefinitions…………………………………………………………………………………. 4 \nAdolescence……………………………………………………………………………….. 4 \n Risk Factors………………………………………………………………………... 5 \n  Negative Outcomes………………………………………………………… 6 \n  Bisexual Identification…………………………………………………….. 6 \n  Stigma……………………………………………………………………… 7 \n  Self-Concealment………………………………………………………….. 8 \n Protective Factors………………………………………………………………….. 9 \n  Social Acceptance………………………………………………………….. 9 \n  Coming Out………………………………………………………………… 12 \n  Internal Resources…………………………………………………………. 14 \n  v \n \n  Family……………………………………………………………………… 16 \nAdulthood………………………………………………………………………………….. 17 \nDiscussion and Conclusions……………………………………………………………….. 19 \nFuture Research..…………………………………………………………………………... 21 \nImplications…..……………………………………………………………………………. 25 \nReferences………………………………………………………………………………….. 27 \nIntroduction \nLesbian, gay, and bisexual (sexual minority) identification is less seen as a risk \nfactor in recent years than the stigma that is associated with identifying as a sexual \nminority.  As more people come out identifying as a sexual minority at younger ages \n(Bohan, Russell, & Montgomery, 2001), awareness has grown about the risk of the \nstigma associated with that identification.  While sexual minorities as a whole may be \nmore likely to experience the stigma risk factor, this risk may have a more profound \nimpact on the lives of individuals coming out during adolescence (Russell & Joyner, \n2001).  It is important to note that it is not sexual identity itself that is a risk factor, but \nthe stigma that may be associated with an identity as a sexual minority.  The stigma \nexperienced by sexual minorities can be characterized as sexual prejudice (commonly \nreferred to as homophobia or heterosexism), and it is the impact of this phenomenon \nalong with protective factors during youth and adulthood with regard to graduate students \nthat will be examined. \nRisk and protective factors are important to examine because of the effects they \nhave on psychological outcomes.  Sexual prejudice, stereotyping, and a pull toward \nsexual minority communities are intergenerational experiences that affect sexual minority \nindividuals of all ages.  Sexual minority adolescents face struggles that are unique to \ndeveloping an identity as sexual minorities (Potoczniak, Aldea, & DeBlaere, 2007) \ncompared to their straight counterparts in the context of a culture that sees them as \nsecond-class citizens.  This struggle may have developmental implications for sexual \nminority individuals as they progress from adolescence and begin to solidify their \nidentities in adulthood.  Despite the social progress that has been made with regard to gay \n  2 \n \nrights in the United States, sexual minority individuals still struggle with the effects of \nthe stigma on a daily basis. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this review is to investigate the protective factors experienced by \nsexual minority graduate students.  There is an abundance of empirical research \ninvestigating protective factors in sexual minority adolescents.  There is less but still \nthorough research investigating protective factors in sexual minority adults, but none \nfound by this author that specifically looks at risk and protective factors experienced by \nsexual minority graduate students.  A better understanding of the protective factors \nexperience in graduate school and their outcomes may provide information to graduate \nprograms, community resources, and societal institutions about how to meet the unique \nneeds and challenges of sexual minority graduate students and applicants. \nSexual minority individuals in general experience unique challenges in the \ncontext of a society where a sexual minority status may still be seen as taboo.  It is \nimportant to understand how to compensate for these challenges in order to ensure sexual \nminority graduate students are as successful as students who do not identify as a sexual \nminority and do not experience the unique challenges that affect this minority group.  \nAccording to Spencer and Patrick (2009), “social stigma and the resulting psychosocial \nconsequences of developing in a heterosexist society, as well as the protective factors \nagainst these negative influences, must be better understood to build a more inclusive and \ncomprehensive social and developmental psychology” (p. 192). \nWhile there are several potential risk and protective factors that contribute to \nmyriad psychological and health outcomes for sexual minority individuals, some factors \n  3 \n \nmay be more shared or unique to the experience of individuals identifying as a sexual \nminority graduate student.  As graduate students are often between the ages of 20 and 40, \nthere may be protective factors in adulthood beyond the adolescent experience that are \nhighly relevant.  Because the graduate school application process and graduate school \nitself may be considered arduous and demanding on the lives on individuals embarking \non such a pursuit, sexual minority individuals who experience risk factors with regard to \nstigma may have a differential experience from not only their straight counterparts but \ntheir adolescent and non-graduate-school-attending sexual minority peers.  In point of \nfact, their likelihood of pursuing graduate school in the first place or successfully \ncompleting a graduate program may be lessened due to the extenuating social and \npsychological pressures of identifying as a sexual minority.  However, the connection \nbetween these aspects has not been explicitly examined in the literature. \nThis paper will review risk factors and protective factors during adolescence and \nadulthood as influences on the potentially differential experiences of sexual minority \ngraduate students.  Specifically, literature on risk and protective factors are explored as \nreasons sexual minority adults may end up attending graduate school and what protective \nfactors might be bolstered in adolescence in order to facilitate success as an adult.  The \npaper will conclude by identifying implications and potential future research based upon \nthe reviewed literature.  Research in this area is pertinent at an individual level by \nproviding a more thorough consideration of an aspect of experience that influences the \ncareer prospects and psychological and health outcomes of sexual minority individuals; a \ncommunity level by informing community resources and university policies; and, finally, \n  4 \n \na societal level by elucidating the experiences of a minority that is continually growing in \nsocial visibility. \nDefinitions \nFor the purposes of this review, the term sexual minority includes those \nindividuals not identifying as strictly straight or heterosexual who self-identify as lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, or some other status on the basis of their personal sexual identity.  This \ndefinition does not include those individuals who identify as straight and engage in \nsexual intercourse with members of the same sex.  This review investigates research on \nthe experiences of individuals on the basis of their sexual minority identification or status \n(terms used interchangeably in this review) rather than their sexual behavior. \nThis review will also use the term sexual prejudice rather than the more \ncolloquially known homophobia or heterosexism.  According to Herek (2010), “sexual \nprejudice refers to negative attitudes toward an individual because of her or his sexual \norientation” (p. 19).  This may include negative attitudes toward homosexual behavior, \nsexual minority identity or orientation, and sexual minority communities.  Additionally, \nthese attitudes may be held by any individual sexual minority or otherwise. \nAdolescence \n The following section includes a review of the literature related to risk factors for \nsexual minority individuals in adolescence.  A great deal of research has been completed \nin this area.  Suicide, bisexual identity, stigma, and self-concealment of sexual identity \nwill be explored in this section. \n  5 \n \nRisk Factors \nAlong with the stigma of sexual minority identification come several situational \nfactors that affect how an individual relates to others and themselves.  These stressors \ninclude outright discrimination, the expectation of discrimination, internalized sexual \nprejudice (stigma) and remaining in the closet (Rothman, Sullivan, Keyes, & Boehmer, \n2012).  Straight youth have an automatic privilege in terms of meeting developmental \nmilestones compared to sexual minority youth in the sense that they do not have to meet \nthe additional challenges of sexual stigma thrust upon them by a heterosexist society \n(Spencer & Patrick, 2009).  The sexual identity of straight youth is presumed from the \nstart and they are living up to the societal and familial expectations imposed upon them \nfrom the start.  Yet, more research is required to more fully understand the differential \nexperiences of development milestones between sexual minority and straight youth.  \nRemaining in the closet about one’s sexual identity means hiding a part of oneself that is \nsimultaneously valued and disparaged in this society.  The degree to which coming out is \nbeneficial is largely dependent on the degree of acceptance received by primary supports.  \nBecause of this, it may not always be beneficial for an individual to come out.  The \nchoice for many is to stay in the closet suppressing and hiding their sexual identity or \ncoming out into a hostile and unaccepting society or family. \nIncreasingly, individuals are choosing to come out during adolescence, a crucial \ntime of development and identity solidification and experimentation.  In this review, the \nprimary overarching risk factor is considered stigma and the main all-encompassing \nprotective factor is considered acceptance.  Either stigma or acceptance may be received \nfrom others or the self, comprising the sexual minority individual’s internal and external \n  6 \n \nexperiences.  Risk factors tend to increase the chances of negative outcomes and \nprotective factors tend to increase the chances of positive outcomes; however, there has \nbeen little research on how risk and protective factors in adolescence translate into \nnegative and positive outcomes in adulthood, rather than more immediately in \nadolescence.  Rothman et al. (2012) admits that the link between adolescent risk and \nprotective factors, and negative and positive adult outcomes has not yet been fully \nestablished. \nNegative Outcomes.  Sexual minority youth are at a much greater risk of suicide \nthan their sexual majority counterparts.  Studies indicated that sexual minority youth \nexperience suicidal ideation at a significantly greater rate compared to the general \nadolescent population (Russell & Joyner, 2001); additionally, sexual minority youth \nattempt suicide at rates significantly greater than the general adolescent population \nattempts suicide (Russell & Joyner, 2001).  Along with suicidality, other negative \noutcomes in sexual minority youth greater than the general adolescent population include \ndepression, substance abuse, adverse sexual outcomes (Pathela & Shillinger, 2010), \nmental health problems (Jorm, Korten, Rodgers, Jacomb, & Christensen, 2002), juvenile \ndetention, homelessness (Ryan, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez 2009), harassment and \nviolence, dropping out of school, and body image dissatisfaction (Frankowski, 2004; \nBlake et al., 2001).  Collectively, these negative outcomes hinder an individual from \nachieving as well as they might if the stigma against sexual minority status did not exist. \nBisexual Identification.  Research also shows that students identifying as \nbisexual are at even greater risk for many of these negative outcomes than even gay- or \nlesbian-identified adolescents (Robin et al., 2002).  Bisexual individuals are in a unique \n  7 \n \nposition to be at greater risk for stigma than their gay or straight counterparts, because \ntheir sexual identity is more fluid and less defined.  It is this fluidity that may hinder \nidentification with either the straight or gay communities, while increasing the risks \nassociated with stigma overall; not only may stigma be experienced from the sexual \nmajority, but also from other sexual minority members who do not identify or understand \na bisexual orientation.  In addition, bisexual youth showed greater risk behavior probably \nbecause they were more likely to identify as a sexual minority than their straight-\nidentified counterparts who had same-sex sexual experiences (Pathela & Shillinger, \n2010).  Bisexual youth are more likely to experience stigma than either their straight or \ngay counterparts, and bisexuality is much more common in youth than in adulthood \n(Jorm et al., 2002).  Because of this, trouble in school along with the other risk factors \nassociated with stigma will make it more difficult to achieve as much academically, \nsocially, and psychologically as their peers; their chances for positive outcomes are \nlessened. \nStigma.  Social and interpersonal distress experienced in the form of stigma from \nother individuals and society as a whole leads to these aforementioned outcomes.  A \nsocial and cultural environment that is critical of emerging sexual orientation increases \nthe likelihood of isolation due to a fear of being discovered by others.  While the stigma \nexperienced after coming out increases the chances of negative outcomes, not coming out \n(being in the closet) leads to isolation and fragmentation of self that can also lead to \nnegative outcomes (Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, 2008).  This lack of visibility to \nsociety and other individuals reduces an individual’s access to social support, a protective \nfactor (Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, 2008).  These situations can interfere with an \n  8 \n \nadolescent’s achievement of developmental tasks related to self-esteem, identity, and \nintimacy.  Social isolation, abuse, violence, and poorer healthcare access compound the \nrisk factors that lead to risky behavior.  Negative family reactions to sexual orientation \nhave a negative influence on the development of adolescents.  Adverse, punitive, and \ntraumatic reactions by parents or other primary caregivers will have a negative impact on \nrisk behavior therefore leading to further negative outcomes.  Adolescents with no or low \nlevels of family rejection have a significantly lower risk for negative outcomes than those \nfrom highly rejecting families (Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, 2008).  Conflict regarding \nsexual identity is a primary cause of ejection or removal from the home (Ryan et al., \n2009). \nSelf-Concealment.  For all individuals, sexual minority or not, self-concealment \nin general, not just about sexual identity, has harmful effects on mental health with an \nincreased risk of mood and anxiety symptoms (Larson & Chastain, 1990).  Being in the \ncloset is a unique experience for sexual minority individuals and may hold a meaning \nwith unknown consequences, because, as Kavanaugh (1995) explains, the sexual \nminority individual must conceal this aspect of their identity in many areas of life that are \nnonsexual, including the workplace, at school, in public, and so on, that to sexually \nconforming individuals may seem benign. \nAs has been mentioned, risk factors in the form of stigma, personal sexual \nidentity, and the choice to conceal one’s identity increases the risk of various negative \noutcomes for sexual minority individuals.  Along with the risk factors that increase the \nchances for negative outcomes are protective factors that increase the chances for positive \noutcomes. \n  9 \n \nProtective Factors \nDespite the risk for negative outcomes associated with the stigma of sexual \nminority identification, there are many protective factors that lead to positive outcomes \nfor sexual minority adolescents.  It is important to investigate how sexual minority youth \novercome this risk in order to live fulfilling and successful lives.  Protective factors may \ninclude personal psychological resources, such as a strong ego identity, external \nresources (e.g., community involvement, accepting friends and family), and environment \ncontexts (e.g., greater visibility of sexual minorities in the community at large and a sense \nof belonging in the community at large).  Protective factors are those internal and \nexternal influences that promote success and positive psychological and health outcomes \nfor the sexual minority individual. \nSocial Acceptance.  McCallum and McLaren (2011) studied how the sense of \nbelonging in sexual minority adolescents to the general community and the GLB \ncommunity predict depressive symptoms.  Because of the challenge of stigma, it is \ndifficult for sexual minority individuals to find a sense of belonging rather than \nexperience a sense of isolation associated with being both in and out of the closet.  This \nsense of belonging increases psychological well-being.  McCallum and McLaren found \nthat a sense of belonging to the GLB community and a sense of belonging to the overall \ncommunity benefit sexual minority adolescents’ mental health.  The effects of belonging \nto the general community had a direct effect on positive mental health outcomes and a \nsense of belonging to the GLB community had an indirect effect.  It is important to \nunderstand how these protective factors influence the lives of sexual minority individuals \nand how and what protective factors mitigate the effects of adolescent risk factors. \n  10 \n \nA major factor that has been found to be protective and buffer the effects of other \nsexual minority-related stressors is a sense of community.  That sense of community may \ninclude a sense of belonging within the GLB community or a sense of integration with \nthe community as a whole.  The settings in which sexual minority youth find themselves \ninteracting with others are broadly the same as other adolescents.  These environments \nmight be the home, school, or community at large (Morrow, 1993).  The settings may \nalso include social groups or places where it is safe to meet with individuals who have \nsimilar sexual minority experiences; therefore, interactions with and examinations of the \nqualities of the social environment are paramount in considering the risk factors faced by \nsexual minority youth and how those experiences may affect or interact with either their \npositive or negative adult psychological outcomes. \nStudents attending a school-based support group for sexual minority adolescents \ncalled Program 10 established by the Los Angeles Unified School District tended to have \nimproved attendance, academic performance, and family relationships (Uribe, 1994).  In \naddition, the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth Program in Toronto, Canada, was found \nto decrease the sense of isolation and increase psychological well-being for those youth \nattending (Travers & Paoletti, 1999).  While these groups for sexual minority youth are \nincreasing in availability across the world, more research still needs to be done to \nunderstand their value in terms of mental health and long-term outcomes (McCallum & \nMcLaren, 2011).  McCallum and McLaren (2011) also found that youth who participated \nin Minus18, a GBLT group in Victoria, Australia, reported more of a sense of belonging \nand less depression compared to other sexual minority individuals who did not participate \nin the group, concluding that membership in such a group helps individuals integrated \n  11 \n \ninto the community as a whole and is beneficial to their mental health.  Other research \nhas shown that those adult lesbians with a sense of belonging to the GLB community \nexhibit fewer depressive symptoms (McLaren, 2009).  The link between the sense of \nbelonging in adolescence and the sense of belonging in adulthood, or how belonging in \nadolescence is related to other domains in adulthood has not yet had extensive research. \nNesmith, Burton, and Cosgrove (2008) examined various aspects of social support \nfor sexual minority youth and young adults and how these supports were used in light of \nsocietal and individual stigma.  They discovered that a parent’s initial reaction to coming \nout was a keystone in the coming out process setting the stage for the development of \nsocial support in adolescence as a sexual minority.  A major theme the authors discovered \nwas that with both the absence and presence of family support, and with the majority of \nrespondents reporting a negative or neutral relationship with their parents, many youth \ncreated a “family of choice” within the GLB community.  It appeared as though sexual \nminority youth were adapting to a lack of familial support by bolstering their community \nsupport.  This community support is likely facilitated by the fact that sexual minority \nindividuals share a common cultural experience of discrimination and marginalization \ndue to sexual minority identification (Kimmel, 2000).  In fact, Kimmel (2000) found that \ncommon experiences shared with sexual minority peers reduced isolation, thereby \nconstituting a protective factor from negative outcomes. \nGrowing up in a homophobic environment is a risk factor for negative outcomes, \nand coming of age as a sexual minority in an accepting environment is a protective factor \nfor positive outcomes.  The range of quality and types of social support that may exist \nbetween totally rejecting and totally accepting social situations can impact a sexual \n  12 \n \nminority youth’s social network in a variety of ways including the development, size, \nquality, and security one may find in that support (Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, 2008).  \nNesmith, Burton, and Cosgrove (2008) go on to say that social service providers may \nmodel or present positive and effective ways of approaching the coming out process and \nnavigating their social support network during this potentially strained time. \nMeyer (1995) suggested that sexual minority individuals experience a unique \ncultural phenomenon as they, unlike other types of minority individuals, are born into \nfamilies who do not belong to the same cultural group.  Overall, they may live out much \nof their lives isolated from sexual minority cultural groups.  According to Meyer’s \ntheory, heterosexism experienced in the context of social and cultural isolation reinforce \nthe internalized minority status.   As we have seen, exposure to and identification with \ngroups of other sexual minority individuals is a protective factor that can prevent \nnegative consequences in adolescence. \nComing Out.  Sexual minority individuals who do come out have a variety of \nexperiences and these experiences tend to suggest particular types of outcomes.  Rothman \net al. (2012) found that for females, but not males, in a sample of Massachusetts sexual \nminority youth, coming out to parents was associated with few negative outcomes like \nrisky health behavior and more positive outcomes like greater physical and mental health.  \nDespite this, Rothman et al. (2012) also found that the environment into which youth \ncome out has a significant effect on risk and outcomes.  For both males and females, lack \nof familial support tended to suggest negative health risk behaviors along with negative \nmental health outcomes such as depression.  This suggests the effect of negative \noutcomes that stigma can have on youth who come out and the lack of family support that \n  13 \n \nthey risk in doing so.  The results found by Rothman et al. (2012) support other research \nthat has found links between parental support and mental health in sexual minority youth \n(Ryan et al., 2009). \nThe connection between disclosure of sexual orientation and its protective aspects \nhas been found to be significant not only in terms of self-acceptance but in the reduction \nof stress associated with concealment and coming out as a predecessor to developing a \nhealthy social support network (Rosario, Schrimshaw, & Hunter, 2009).  While coming \nout itself to family and friends is a significant aspect of development for sexual minority \nindividuals, the reactions by others in the social support network vary considerably across \nexperiences.  In addition, while individuals tend to come out to friends before family \nmembers (Beals & Peplau, 2006), there is still a considerable amount of anxiety about the \nreactions of those friends and losing that social support (Diamond & Lucas, 2004).  After \nall, being out about sexual orientation is related to experiencing more victimization in \nschool (D’Augelli, Pilkington, & Hershberger, 2002).   \nUltimately, Rosario, Schrimshaw, and Hunter (2009) discuss the difference \nbetween an accepting reaction to coming out as opposed to a rejecting reaction to coming \nout.  Acceptance relieves fear and bolsters social support and rejection increases \nstressors, risk of confrontation, loss of support, social isolation, and negative self-image.  \nThis examination speaks to the effects of stigma in an institutionally heterosexist, \nhomophobic society: social support is a protective factor for sexual minority individuals \nand social rejection is a risk factor.  Accepting reactions from social support should be \nstress-buffering during the coming out process and throughout the life of the individual, \nleading to higher self-esteem and more support; however, this phenomenon underscores \n  14 \n \nhow dependent the psychological health of the individual is dependent on the social \ncontext in which one finds oneself. \nRosario, Schrimshaw, and Hunter (2009) found that it was not the number of \ntimes an individual came out that was related to substance use, rather the number of \nperceived rejecting reactions.  More rejecting reactions to coming out was associated \nwith greater tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use on top of the symptoms associated with \nabuse.  They found this to be true even after they controlled for emotional distress, \nmeaning that rejection was directly associated with substance use.  Therefore, substance \nuse was not used to cope with emotional distress due to coming out per se, but to cope \nwith emotional distress caused by the stigma associated with coming out that leads to low \nself-esteem and internalized sexual prejudice.  As a protective factor, accepting reactions \nto coming out were found to moderate future alcohol use (rather than all substance use \nexamined) over time, blunting the effects of earlier rejecting reactions.  So, while it is \nimpossible to prevent all rejecting reactions to coming out by individuals who provide \nsocial support to sexual minority individuals, acceptance later on may be a protective \nfactors, lessening the effects of initial or early rejection. \nInternal Resources.  Spencer and Patrick (2009) asserted that personal mastery \nand social support are protective factors against negative psychological outcomes for \nsexual minority individuals.  Pearlin and Schooler (1978) define mastery as the degree to \nwhich an individual believes he/she can control the forces that affect their lives.  A sense \nof mastery reduces stress and increases well-being among individuals.  Due to the \nautomatic disadvantage of sexual minority individuals in the sense of the stress they \nexperience due to stigma about sexual orientation, they are at greater risk for stress and \n  15 \n \nlower well-being overall.  Understanding the mechanisms behind personal mastery may \ngive us clues as to how to promote the well-being and reduce the stress (making more \nrobust the protective factors) of sexual minority adolescents, thereby increasing the \nlikelihood of positive psychological outcomes. \nOverall, Spencer and Patrick (2009) found that internal resources such as self-\nesteem and external resources such as social support were associated with relatively \npositive psychological outcomes for their research sample.  This corroborates research by \nAnderson (1998) that suggested such personal resources were protective in terms of \nidentity maintenance and resilience.  Differences between groups based on sexual \nminority identification were significantly lessened when the mediating relationships of \npersonal mastery and social support were considered.  Part of what limits the effects of \nprotective factors for sexual minorities is that there is less of a guarantee of social support \nduring times of crisis and being the target of institutionalized heterosexism might \nincrease a sense of victimization leading to decreased personal mastery.  This further \nhighlights the need for sexual minority individuals to develop protective factors both \ninternally and externally in order to cope during all phases of life and underscores the \nneed for us as professionals in the field of psychology to understand the causes and \noutcomes institutionalized discrimination has on this group.  While Spencer and Patrick \n(2009) assert that improving an individual’s social support network qualitatively in such a \nway that is similar to “naturally occurring systems” (p. 197) and facilitating identification \nwith social groups may likely protect against depression and low self-esteem, they \nultimately recommend that the most effective approach to reducing sexual minority stress \nis to reduce heterosexist societal attitudes – a tall order. \n  16 \n \nFamily.  Research has shown that families can play a nurturing and protective \nrole in general and that family connections have been shown to protect against health risk \nbehaviors (Resnick et al., 1997); however, these relationships are challenged by coming \nout in a heterosexist, homophobic society (D’Augelli, Grossman, & Starks, 2005).  These \nrelationships can improve over time as parents become more sensitive to the needs and \nwell-being of sexual minority children.  Ryan et al. (2010) point out specific familial \nbehaviors of acceptance that have a lasting and dramatic protective influence on sexual \nminority youth’s identity development and health.  First, they found that gender and type \nof sexual identity (i.e., gay, lesbian, bisexual) did not have an effect on family \nacceptance.  However, they did find that other factors overall did appear to be associated \nwith less acceptance of sexual minority youth: Latino, immigrant, religious, and low \nsocioeconomic status.  They assert that it is the composition of characteristics of families \nrather than the identity itself that makes a significant difference in distinguishing between \nacceptance and rejection of families.  More specifically, they found that acceptance in \nadolescence led to positive health outcomes in adulthood like higher self-esteem, social \nsupport, and overall health and protected against negative health outcomes like \ndepression, substance use, and suicidal ideation.  Third, they found the effects of family \nacceptance to persist at least through young adulthood.  Socially, not fitting in with the \nmost typical labels such as “gay,” “lesbian,” or “bisexual” and not identifying with \nstereotypes around those identities may be an important factor in early suicide attempts \nfor sexual minority individuals. \n  17 \n \nSocial acceptance, coming out, internal resources, and family and community \nsupport all constitute protective factors for sexual minority adolescents.  The next section \nwill elucidate protective factors experienced in adulthood by sexual minority individuals. \nAdulthood \nEmerging adulthood is described as a time from the age of 18 through the late-20s \nafter adolescence but before a solid adult identity has been formed (Spencer & Patrick, \n2009).  Little is known about the influence of sexual minority status on development \nduring this time of life, a time when many students attend graduate school.   \nIn fact, Spencer and Patrick (2009) suggest that this time of life may be the most \ndifficult developmental stages for sexual minority individuals because sexual prejudice \nhinders identity exploration in adolescence in the context of a socially rejecting \nenvironment.  Overall, Spencer and Patrick (2009) did find that sexual minority \nindividuals report worse psychological well-being than their heterosexual counterparts \nduring this life period supported by two outcome measures.  They found that \nheterosexuals reported significantly higher self-esteem, likely due to the influence of a \nculture accepting of their sexual orientation.  Additionally, their results supported \nMeyer’s (1995) minority stress hypothesis in that sexual minority identification was \nassociated with poorer well-being, increased psychological stress, and a greater risk of \ndepressive symptoms. \nGalambos, Barker, & Krahan (2006) found a decrease in depressive symptoms \nand increase in self-esteem across a seven-year period for individuals during emerging \nadulthood.  They suggested that the initial risk factors experienced in adolescence have \n  18 \n \nless influence over time.  They did, however, find that other factors, such as marriage, \nimproved psychological well-being during this life stage.  As of this writing, only eleven \nstates and the District of Columbia in the United States have legalized same-sex \nmarriage, which limits the effects of this as a protective factor and may even represent a \nrisk factor in the overall scheme of development during emerging adulthood.  Because \nthe majority of states have passed constitutional amendments and legislation barring \nsexual minority individuals from marrying, sexual prejudice is still very much \ninstitutionalized in many places across the country contributing to social ostracism and \nthe damaging effects of sexual stigma.  Spencer and Patrick (2009) admit that because we \nstill exist in the context of a sexually prejudiced society, development is likely different \nfor sexual minority individuals, especially those who cannot explore their personal \nidentity, construct social support, and develop a robust sense in adolescence.  This is also \nnot to say that the risk factors such as social isolation do not continue into adulthood \ndespite the overall rise in well-being during the developmental phase.  Research in this \narea will be critical in creating a more comprehensive model of sexual minority identity \ndevelopment during adulthood and later into life. \nAnother study (Potoczniak, Aldea, & DeBlaere, 2007) found that social anxiety is \nlessened with greater social support in sexual minority individuals while ego identity \ncommitment and exploration was heightened with greater social support.  Thus, they \nsuggest that decreased social anxiety leads to increased social support, which then leads \nto more robust ego identity development.  On the other hand, they found that greater \nsocial anxiety leads to more self-concealment, suggesting a lessened degree of ego \nidentity development.  Again social support and acceptance is shown to enhance personal \n  19 \n \ndevelopment, constituting further evidence of it as a protective factor against negative \noutcomes.  They further suggest that an environment of support and acceptance “should \nnot be ignored or underestimated” (p. 454).  A desire to or the need for self-concealment \nis a difficulty in the life of a sexual minority individual.  Regardless of the potential \nconsequences whether positive or negative, being in the closet will negatively affect \nsomeone in terms of social support and ego identity development.  In the end, \nPotoczniak, Aldea, and DeBlaere (2007) infer that social support mediates social anxiety \nand one’s overall ability to engage in self-exploration and commitment. \nBerger and Kelly (1996) found that sexual minority adults tend to be strongly \nintegrated in their social networks, but that the structural map of their social lives is \nunique in that they tend to identify closely with families of choice in addition to or rather \nthan their birth families.  Meyer (2003) conducted a meta-analysis and found disparities \nin substance abuse for adults depending on their sexual orientation.  Overall, similarities \nmay be found in the risk and protective factors between adolescent and adult sexual \nminority individuals.  This may be due to differences in developmental stage and \nresilience acquired during adolescence due to the various factors they may or may not \nhave experienced.  Little or no research has been conducted examining these factors in \ngraduate students specifically. \nDiscussion and Conclusions \n The purpose of this review was to investigate extant research regarding risk and \nprotective factors for sexual minority graduate students.  It is important to recognize that \nsexual minorities are often combined into the “GLBTQ” (gay, lesbian, bisexual, \n  20 \n \ntransgender, queer/questioning) moniker; each community within this overarching label \nis separate and distinct with its own norms and values (Fassinger & Arsenau, 2007), \nespecially with regard to bisexual individuals who are marginalized not only by straight \npeople but by other sexual minorities as well (Potoczniak, 2007).  The degree of unique \nexperiences among individuals is vast.  From adolescence, sexual minority individuals \nmust deal with the risks associated with stigma whether that identity is disclosed to others \nor suppressed and they remain in the closet.  While sexual minority identity itself is not a \nrisk factor, it is important for clinicians and individuals to understand the risks associated \nwith that personal identity and what the protective factors are to buffer against the risk \nfactors. \nProtective factors for adolescents and adults have included social support, \ncommunity involvement, family acceptance, and internal and external psychological \nresources (McCallum & McLaren, 2011; Kimmel, 2000; Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, \n2008; Travers & Paoletti, 1999).  Risk factors are largely attributed to the stigma of \nsexual minority identification and the resulting rejection by peers and family members \nthat lead to many negative health and psychological outcomes (Rothman et al., 2012; \nSpencer & Patrick, 2009; Nesmith, Burton, & Cosgrove, 2008; Jorm et al., 2002).  A \ngreater understanding of the risk and protective factors experienced by graduate students \nwill allow individuals, institutions, and communities to promote the success of the \nindividuals who must cope with these unique difficulties and challenges. \n \n \n  21 \n \nFuture Research \n Although there is much research with regard to protective factors for adolescents, \nthere is less research on protective factors for adults, and none that this author found \nspecifically pertaining to graduate students.  Research on protective factors has \nhighlighted the significance of stigma as risk and external and internal supports as \nprotective; yet, little is known about how these factors are relevant specifically to the \nexperiences of sexual minority graduate students.  There is no indication in the literature \nthat there are any similarities or differences between graduate students and their non-\ngraduate peers and adolescents. \nPotoczniak, Aldea, and DeBlaere (2007) suggest that more in-depth knowledge of \nmoderating and mediating factors between ego identity development and sexual \norientation might help mental health professionals promote higher degrees of \npsychological well-being for sexual minority individuals into adulthood.  A greater \nunderstanding of ego identity development in this population may help by providing \nprofessionals with tools or signs that suggest a particular degree of development and what \nmilestones or benchmarks must be reached in order to facilitate this development in \nclients and patients.  Interventions may be structured in such a way as to foster positive \noutcomes. \nIt may be important to understand how the quality of relationships in adolescence \naffects the quality of relationships in adulthood for sexual minority individuals and if \nthere is any relationship between that and positive psychological outcomes, or in this case \ngraduate school attendance as a positive outcome.  Admittedly, little research has been \n  22 \n \ndone examining the influence of sexual minority identification on human development \nduring emerging adulthood (Spencer & Patrick, 2009), a time when many individuals \nattend graduate school.  More research will be needed in order to determine the unique \ndevelopmental phenomena occurring during this time in a sexual minority individual’s \nlife. \nIt is important to understand how social acceptance in adolescence impacts the \nadult lives of sexual minority individuals and to see if there is a connection between \naccess to such resources and whether an individual ends up in graduate school or not.  \nPerhaps sexual minority individuals who end up in graduate school have had similar \nexperiences that suggest graduate school as an outcome.  This information might be used \nto determine if expanding exposure to protective factors into other types of minority \ncommunities like racial or ethnic minority communities might help to increase the access \nto and likelihood of achieving a graduate level education. \nRosario, Schrimshaw, and Hunter (2009) admit that despite the importance of a \nrobust theoretical, preventative, and intervention-oriented framework for understanding \nwhy sexual minority individuals tend to engage in riskier behavior leading to negative \noutcomes than their heterosexual counterparts, this phenomenon requires substantially \nmore examination in order to understand what leads to these outcomes.  Understanding \nhow educating parents and social entities about the experience of sexual minority \nindividuals about the potential negative effects of rejection and the potential positive \nresults of acceptance are pertinent to explore.  There is still much to learn about the \neffects of acceptance and rejection in this context and how education and awareness can \nbe a protective factor.  Indeed, social support programs for sexual minority individuals \n  23 \n \nhave been shown to be associated with lessened substance use and other risk behavior \namong youth (Blake et al., 2001).  As awareness grows around sexual stigma in the \ngeneral population, it becomes more crucial to understand how to effectively address the \nconcerns of these individuals. \nThe mechanisms behind improving family acceptance over time or increasing \nfamily acceptance to coming out in the first place require more research.  Though \nD’Augelli et al. (2005) found this improvement in relationships between parents and their \nsexual minority children, research into how the conflict with family surrounding an \nindividual’s sexual orientation can be avoided in the first place is crucial.  Future \nresearchers should look at the differences between accepting families and rejecting \nfamilies and how acceptance may be fostered and supported before the fact, \npreventatively, rather that after the coming out process and initial rejection has already \ntaken place. \nFuture research should also focus on why those individuals who do not subscribe \nto a stereotyped or more common identity such as “gay,” “lesbian,” or “bisexual” are at \ngreater risk (Ryan et al., 2010).  A deeper understanding of the connection between the \nindividual and their identity and how that identity places them in society is important for \nunderstanding the nuances surrounding sexuality and how a sexual minority identity \nuniquely affects the individual in a social context. \nPotoczniak, Aldea, and DeBlaere (2007) suggest that assessing ego identity within \na particular group of people may elucidate the psychosocial characteristics of that group, \ndescribing how professionals, individuals, and institutions may structure support to aid \n  24 \n \nthat group.  As sexual minority individuals face distinctive difficulties during identity \ndevelopment (Kimmel, Rose, & David, 2006), it will be important to more thoroughly \nconceptualize their need for protective factors with regard to ego identity development.  \nThis is all the more important in the context of the sexual minority experience of \nprejudice and oppression. \nJordan and Deluty (2000) discuss how concealing personal information about \noneself affects perceptions of social support.  In their study, sexual orientation disclosure \nand significant relationship satisfaction are related such that more concealment of sexual \norientation suggested less satisfaction with their relationships in general.  Because sexual \nminority individuals generally have perceptions of less social support, more research \nabout the quality, quantity, and perceptions of coming out will help elucidate the link \nbetween being out of the closet and quality of life differences between adolescence and \nadulthood. \nExploration of how bisexual individuals fit into the overall schema of the sexual \nminority communities as a whole is pertinent due to the differences found between their \nexperiences with “monosexual” individuals (lesbians and gays) (Potoczniak, 2007).  \nMore research in the context of bisexual identity development in the context of \ndiscrimination and misunderstanding from both sexually conforming individuals and \nsexual minority individuals will be important in illuminating the nuances that \ndifferentiate the various communities and individuals identifying as a sexual minority. \n \n \n  25 \n \nImplications \n Research on protective factors in sexual minority graduate students has \nimplications for policies and programs at the individual, community, and societal levels.  \nThis author found no research specifically regarding the protective factors of graduate \nstudents, despite thorough research completed regarding protective factors in adolescence \nand adulthood in general for sexual minority individuals.  It will be important to discern \nthe unique difficulties experienced by these individuals in order to provide graduate \nschools, prospective and current graduate students, and community organizations and \nfamilies the tools to promote and enhance protective factors and thus the likelihood of \nsuccess for sexual minority graduate students. \n Examples may include promoting group visibility of sexual minorities on a \nsocietal level such as advocating for political change; enhancing sexual minority focused \ncommunity programs; enforcing policies of inclusion for sexual minority individuals in \ngraduate programs; and, providing tools for families in order to help them increase the \nchances of success for the sexual minority individual in graduate school.  It will be \nimportant to elucidate any connection between sexual minority adolescent and adult \nprotective factors with sexual minority graduate students protective factors. \n Ultimately, further research has implications for a better understanding of the \nexperiences of sexual minority graduate students.  Additional research may provide a \nmore detailed examination of what protective factors are most salient for graduate \nstudents, as well as broaden the currently expanding discussion about gay rights as a \nwhole by providing this new perspective.  Quality of life is impacted by the stigma that \n  26 \n \nsometimes comes with sexual minority identification, and a better understanding of the \nprotective factors experienced by graduate students has relevance for not only graduate \nprograms but the individuals who attend them and the families and social institutions that \nsupport them.  \n  27 \n \nReferences \nAnderson, A.

    "abstract": "Gay, lesbian, and bisexual (sexual minority) individuals are at greater risk of experiencing risk factors for negative health and psychological outcomes in adolescence than their straight counterparts. This is largely due to the stigma and social consequences of outwardly identifying as a sexual minority. However, some sexual minority individuals experience protective factors that bolster social support during adolescence, which may act as a buffer against the effects of stigma leading to more positive health and psychological outcomes in adulthood. Both adolescent risk factors and protective factors in sexual minority individuals may contribute to professional success and achievement in adult life vis-à-vis their resultant psychological and health outcomes. As sexual minority individuals in adolescence tend to experience risk and protective factors differently from their straight counterparts, the same may also be true for individuals attending graduate school. Certain protective factors in adolescence may be commonly experienced for individuals who end up attending graduate school. Very little empirical research has been conducted to examine the differential experiences during adolescence with regard to protective factors and sexual minority identification in graduate students. This paper focuses on the impact that protective factors during adolescence may contribute to graduate school as an outcome for sexual minority individuals. Specifically, family support, social support, ego identity, personal psychological resources, and acceptance are considered. Areas of future research are also discussed",
