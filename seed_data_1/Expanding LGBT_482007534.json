The LGBT initials that once signaled solidarity and intersection are now appearing limited because they highlight only certain subgroups. Although many movement organizations have adopted a more expansive formulation of LGBT, national legal rights organizations have limited their agendas to LGBT issues. Until recently, they devoted the bulk of their efforts to gay and lesbian concerns by focusing on securing marriage equality and sexual orientation-based antidiscrimination protections. Lately, their agenda has expanded to encompass transgender rights, but that work has centered around transgender individuals who are gender conforming. To pursue these goals, national organizations have used assimilationist arguments that tend to exclude the less mainstream members of the LGBT community. This Article argues that including nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights would require national LGBT organizations to reformulate their current goals and tactics in ways that could benefit not just nonbinary, intersex, and asexual individuals, but also more marginalized current members of the LGBT community. For that reason, what is at stake in expanding national LGBT rights groups’ agendas is as much the representation of existing members as it is that of new ones. However, such a change could have significant costs, as national organizations have pursued assimilationist goals and strategies because these are effective and efficient means of securing legal rights.

In 2018, a poll showed that 80% of Americans reported knowing what the letters in “LGBT” represent; that majority dropped to 53% when the acronym expanded to “LGBTQ,” 13% when it became “LGBTQIA,” and 5% for “LGBTQIAPK.” Id. The initials represent lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual/ally, pansexual/polyamorous, and kink, with kink including both fetish and BDSM. See generally LGBTQIA Resource Center Glossary, U.C. DAVIS (Jan. 14, 2020), https://lgbtqia.ucdavis.edu/educated/glossary [https://perma.cc/6CMK-4GBH] (discussing the different identity categories). For LGBT rights groups that have expanded to become LGBTQ or LGBTQIA groups, the “Q” represents “queer” and “A” represents “asexual.” See, e.g., HRC Staff, HRC Officially Adopts Use of “LGBTQ” to Reflect Diversity of Own Community, HRC (June 3, 2016), https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc- officially-adopts-use-of-lgbtq-to-reflect-diversity-of-own-community [https://perma.cc/4227- VB2P]; see also Kayley Weinberg, NOW Updates Acronym: LGBTQIA, NOW (Aug. 11, 2014), https://now.org/blog/now-updates-acronym-lgbtqia/ [https://perma.cc/BM8L-K3DA] (providing definitions for the terms the LGBTQIA initialization represents). The “rainbow coalition” is used to denote a coalition of sexual minorities as well as the LGBT movement in particular. The rainbow has connoted diversity for many minority groups and the meaning of “rainbow coalition” has changed over time.

Conflict over lexical visibility mirrors debates over legal representation. Twenty years ago, national gay and lesbian rights groups expanded their agendas and mission statements to incorporate transgender issues, thereby becoming the contemporary LGBT rights movement.9 The question for national organizations today is whether and to what extent they should promote queer, intersex, or asexual rights.10 This issue is particularly salient since the movement as a whole is at an inflection point. Organizations have enjoyed immense successes in recent years, securing both marriage equality and employment-related antidiscrimination protections.11 These victories provide an opportunity to tackle new legal issues, as well as deploy accumulated political and social capital to increase the movement’s representation. For many of the LGBT national organizations’ constituents, the groups should focus on promoting equality and inclusion for all sexual and gender minorities, and therefore organizations should address queer, intersex, and asexual rights.12 Others are sympathetic to the injustices that queer, intersex, and asexual individuals suffer, but ultimately see these identity groups as categorically different.13 They may also identify such inclusion as   8.

This Article highlights these three groups because QIA are the three letters most often appended to LGBT. They are of course only some of the identity categories that have sought a place within the LGBT coalition. The framework this Article puts forward may help resolve the question of how other identity categories, including pansexuality, polyamory, and kink, fit under the LGBT umbrella.  11.

The term queer is expansive in its meaning, applying to anyone who is not heterosexual or cisgender, including lesbians and gay men.15 In addition to reclaiming a slur for the LGBT community as a whole, “queer” also serves to reinforce the place of “genderqueer” individuals—a term for someone who does not conform to traditional gender roles.16 Given the panoply of individuals who self-identify as queer, this Article cannot address all dimensions of queer rights. This Article limits its discussion of queer to nonbinary issues, even though the terms are not synonymous, because nonbinary individuals form a distinct subgroup whose interests are not subsumed under the LGBT label. Intersex and asexual are more easily definable categories, although they are no less complex. Intersex individuals are people who are born with variations in physical sex characteristics, while asexuals are those who do not experience sexual attraction.17 Notably, there are variations within each of these multifaceted categories, which this Article details. Because of the many divergent experiences of nonbinary, intersex, and asexual individuals, this Article’s discussion does not encompass all who fall within the scope of Q, I, or A, but its analysis and conclusions apply to many. Although many people recognize there is an affinity between LGBT and QIA interests,18 how the categories and their legal rights relate to one another is far from clear.19 Therefore, this Article provides a thorough description of these social, political, and legal causes, analyzing the   14.

The irony of describing communities that often stridently resist categorization cannot be overstated. However, describing the identity groups is a necessary prerequisite for expanding the conception of who the LGBT umbrella could and should protect. This tension between cabined definitions and expansive self-representation reflects the broader problem associated with identity-based politics, which have created a tradeoff between legal protections and the recognition of intragroup differences.20 This Article argues that including nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights would fundamentally challenge national organizations’ agendas and approaches in ways that affect not just QIA interests, but also many current members of the LGBT community. In other words, what is at stake in what advocacy LGBT rights groups undertake is as much the representation of current movement members as it is adding new ones. The reason for this is that national groups have secured rights gains through two interrelated assimilationist tactics: (1) appealing to middle class norms and respectability and (2) arguing that gays and lesbians are like heterosexuals in all but the gender of their sexual partner.21 Because of these assimilationist approaches, national LGBT rights groups’ victories have primarily benefited a distinct minority within the LGBT community—its white, relatively affluent, and gender conforming members.22 Organizations’ priorities and arguments have also marginalized bisexuals, despite their prominence within the acronym.23 Some of the aims of nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights currently align with national LGBT institutional priorities, but many are more integrated with the interests of less mainstream LGBT individuals. A more expansive legal agenda could thus produce a different vision of rights, one that would promote the interests of LGBT individuals who do not fit the assimilationist mold.24 At the same time, national organizations have pursued assimilationist goals and strategies because these are   20.

Of course, promoting these LGBT community members’ interests does not require expanding to QIA, but movement expansion would press national organizations to take up the rights of more marginal members of LGBT. 6Florida Law Review, Vol. 73, Iss. 2 [2021], Art. 1https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol73/iss2/12021] EXPANDING LGBT 249  effective and efficient means of securing legal rights.25 Social movements are limited in their abilities to assert non-assimilationist claims, which is why movements of all kinds have adopted assimilationist strategies.26 Expanding representation could therefore come at a significant price. Bound up in the question of whether national organizations should take up queer, intersex, and asexual rights is therefore a broader debate over how institutions should deploy their limited political capital, time, and money. This Article’s arguments are limited to national LGBT rights organizations, rather than the LGBT movement as a whole, since there is an essential distinction between the two. Social movements are organized groups of individuals who engage in “sustained campaigns of claim making,” working to change policies, politics, and laws, typically by engaging in direct democracy efforts.27 The LGBT movement is legally dominated, with lawyers from national organizations serving as the primary leaders, but there are other groups under the movement umbrella with differing priorities and goals.28 Indeed, the LGBT coalition encompasses members with discordant perspectives on transgender and bisexual inclusion,29 and the LGBT umbrella encompasses   25.

However, national LGBT rights groups have organized around a set of common goals and strategies, which typically exclude nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights.32 By examining the place   30.

In the mid-2010s, most local, state, and regional LGBT organizations added “Q” to their mission statements, but not all national organizations have made the switch to LGBTQ, and the agendas of those that have often do not reflect nonbinary interests. See infra note 32 and accompanying text.  32. This Article discusses national “LGBT” rights organizations even though many of these groups are officially LGBTQ because nonbinary interests often receive little, if any, representation within national organizations, like the Human Rights Campaign, ACLU, Lambda Legal, and National LGBTQ Task Force.

POVERTY L. CTR., https://www.splcenter.org/ issues/lgbt-rights [https://perma.cc/TN9Z-9MLD]. National organizations’ transgender rights advocacy either ignores nonbinary needs or makes them less likely to come into being by focusing on those issues that reinforce gender as binary. The groups’ goals and strategies imply that individuals live as either men or women, rather than inhabit the liminal space between. Indeed, oral argument on whether Title VII encompasses sexual orientation discrimination, gender identity discrimination, or both, highlighted nonbinary individuals’ exclusion. The attorney arguing for LGBT rights dismissed nonbinary identity as people who “might be out there,” and argued that nonbinary rights were irrelevant to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision.

First, this Article augments emerging literature on nonbinary, asexual, and intersex rights. This scholarship is underdeveloped: nonbinary rights have only recently become the subject of increased academic treatment, with Professor Jessica Clarke publishing the first sustained analysis of the subject in 2019.33 Likewise, asexual legal issues have received little attention since Professor Elizabeth Emens wrote Compulsory Sexuality, an article that focused on asexuality and antidiscrimination laws, in 2014.34 As for intersex rights, scholarship flourished in the mid-2000s due to advocates’ lobbying for a moratorium on infant genital normalizing surgery.35 That scholarly interest waned after medical experts and leading advocates jointly issued a consensus statement that limited surgery to remedy physical impairments, as opposed to cosmetic concerns.36 However, as this Article  nonbinary designation on their U.S. passport.

This Article adds to existing scholarship on nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights both by presenting new research on the identity categories’ legal claims and by analyzing their relationship to other sexual and gender minorities. This Article also contributes to scholarship on the LGBT movement’s development and evolution. Professors William Eskridge, Nan Hunter, Gwendolyn Leachman, and Douglas NeJaime have detailed national organizations’ litigation agendas, analyzing shifts in the groups’ goals and strategies.37 Others, including Professors Elizabeth Galzer and Kenji Yoshino, have critically evaluated the place of bisexuals in the LGBT movement.38 In previous work, I have analyzed the LGBT legal movement’s formation, as well as how organizations have prioritized gender conforming transgender rights over nonbinary interests.39 This Article shifts the inquiry in a new direction by analyzing possible future formulations of the national LGBT legal movement. This Article’s analysis is as much a contribution to social movement literature as it is to scholarship on LGBT rights and legal mobilization. First, national LGBT rights groups serve as a unique lens through which to analyze how identity and strategy shape social movements’ contours. Studies of social movements have emphasized that identity and strategy are the two axes that determine coalition building among organizations, with strategy including both the ultimate aims (goals) and means of achieving them (tactics).40 However, this literature has not focused on whether and why a movement will integrate a broader array of identity  L. & GENDER 1 (2018).

For the LGBT movement, “law helped define the contours of the minority group itself.”42 Changing legal and social conceptions of gender and sexuality have shifted the LGBT movement’s membership base, thereby making organizations’ more expansive representation possible.43 Second, this Article raises important questions concerning representation—both what it means and how marginalized identity groups secure it.44 Scholarship on law and social movements has criticized lawyers’ lack of accountability to those that they serve, assuming that legal leadership deradicalizes a movement and thereby reduces its efficacy.45 The national LGBT legal movement’s past and current practices reinforce a more complicated account, whereby movement lawyers must constantly balance ideology and pragmatism, as well as inclusivity and efficiency. Thus, this Article reframes the typical dyad of radicalism versus incrementalism, identifying it as a spectrum along which movement lawyers must make difficult decisions concerning priorities and strategies. This Article proceeds in five parts. Part I sets out social movement theory, which establishes how identity and strategy shape the formation of and collaboration across social movements. It then applies this literature to the history of the LGBT movement, demonstrating how identity and strategy have influenced its past expansion. The LGBT movement’s history illustrates that groups seeking inclusion tend to   41. For a discussion of other movements’ shifting permutations, see infra Section I.A.  42. William N.

Each also analyzes how the groups’ identities and strategies relate to current LGBT interests—and one another. These Parts’ arguments are based on extensive primary source research, including legislative history, court filings, scientific studies, organization newsletters, documentaries, medical guidelines, and newspaper articles. These Parts demonstrate that Q, I, and A each have identity-based connections to, as well as strategic tensions with, national LGBT organizations’ priorities. Disaggregating these issues demonstrates how it is that Q, I, and A all fit within the LGBT umbrella, yet pose a challenge to national organizations’ current priorities and strategies. To illustrate the paradigmatic connections and contradictions between LGBT and QIA, Parts II, III, and IV explore the relationship among the identity categories in several areas of law, specifically antidiscrimination protections, sex-segregated facilities, medical regulations, identity documents, marital benefits, and functional parenthood recognition. These legal issues are not the only points where the groups’ goals intersect. A survey of the field reveals manifold areas where the identity categories have related aims, but the topics presented here exemplify the intersections between LGBT and QIA advocacy and the impediments to a unified national legal movement. These subjects differ in terms of both the extent to which national LGBT organizations are currently invested in the projects, as well as what combination of LGBT and QIA rights they implicate. Additionally, some, like ensuring access to care, may not at first blush appear to be legal projects. However, as this Article explains, they are affected by state and local laws, which is where civil rights reform has increasingly concentrated, and are consequently an important province of lawyers and lawmakers.47 Finally, Part V discusses the theoretical possibilities for LGBT organizations’ representation of nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights in light of the categories’ identity-based and strategic connections. Given the complexities of movement expansion, as well as the tensions such a move would engender, this Part identifies other options for national LGBT rights organizations and QIA advocates. Advocates could engage in more limited collaboration, as social movements often cooperate through coalition work and by providing one another with more circumscribed support. They could also elect an option on the other end of the spectrum from these alliances by reformulating the LGBT   46. George, supra note 9, at 544.  47. See Olatunde C.A.

This Article does not endorse any single possibility but rather lays out the options so that advocates may make an informed choice. Thus, rather than presenting a normative claim as to how the movements ought to collaborate with one another, or prescriptive suggestions for their doing so, Part V provides the analytical framework from which advocates may answer these questions. The relationship between LGBT and QIA is significantly more complex than the evermore prevalent LGBTQIA acronym would suggest. By mapping the terrain of QIA inclusion, this Article both fills a scholarly gap and offers insight for LGBT rights advocates, the nonbinary, intersex, and asexual movements, and legally dominated social movements more generally. I.  SOCIAL MOVEMENT EXPANSION Given how often the initials LGBT and QIA are strung together within the LGBT community, an expansive LGBTQIA legal movement may seem inevitable. However, the history of social movements is punctuated by dissolution, not expansion. This Part first explains how and why movements tend to reshape their membership criteria.48 As Section I.A details, the evolution of any one social movement is deeply contingent, thereby making its future difficult to predict. However, changes invariably turn on the questions of identity and strategy—identity serves as a foundational principle that brings the groups together, while strategic concerns shape how the reformulated movement proceeds. Section I.B then applies social movement theory to the history of the LGBT legal movement, demonstrating how identity and strategy have contoured it specifically. This Part provides the necessary context for understanding the complicated relationships between LGBT and QIA. A.  Identity and Strategy Movement dissolution has received more scholarly attention than movement expansion. Movements often splinter due to internal debates over strategies, with more radical elements either leaving or getting pushed out. In the 1950s, for example, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attempted to purge local chapters with ties to Communism to preempt the red-baiting that hampered its work.49 Similarly, the National Organization for Women (NOW) infamously characterized lesbians as a “lavender menace” that   48. This is also true of political movements, which subdivide, as well as religious groups, which splinter over doctrinal interpretation. See, e.g., JAMES C. BURKEE, POWER, POLITICS, AND THE MISSOURI SYNOD: A CONFLICT THAT CHANGED AMERICAN CHRISTIANITY 20 (2011); Alan I. Abramowitz, Grand Old Tea Party: Partisan Polarization and the Rise of the Tea Party Movement, in STEEP 195, 209 (Lawrence Rosenthal & Christine Trost eds., 2012).  49. See RISA L.

The U.S. labor movement, for example, has seen dramatic changes over the course of its more than century-long history, expanding the types of jobs that fell within its mandate and organizing a greater diversity of people.53 Where unions once focused on craft-based, skilled trades, their membership broadened to encompass semiskilled and unskilled workers.54 Over time, they also began including racial minorities and women in their membership, particularly as World War II and the civil rights gains of the 1960s changed the face of the labor force.55 The labor movement’s increasing representation of men of color and women of all backgrounds in the 1970s illustrates the dual role of identity and strategy in social movement expansion.56 Women and individuals of color sought union membership in this period to improve their working conditions, increase their pay, and secure greater respect,57 but unions were hesitant to recruit or accept these groups as workers.58 Ultimately, unions needed these new members, as weakened labor laws had reduced unions’ role as “chief negotiators for the nation’s . . . welfare,” while new civil rights statutes provided avenues to secure worker rights.59 Additionally, the votes of women and employees of color made a significant difference as to whether a workplace would elect union representation in the first instance.60 Unions had to resolve their internal conflicts about whether race and gender mattered to membership to take advantage of the strategic options that movement expansion offered.61   50.

The Civil Rights movement, for example, emphasized the rights of agricultural laborers in the 1940s, which primarily benefited low-wage workers.62 Those interests ultimately fell by the wayside, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund became best known for challenging the “separate but equal” doctrine in schools in the 1950s.63 The group’s educational victories promoted the interests of a different, and wealthier, set of constituents, but the rights of all African Americans remained within its ambit.64 Changes in priorities are thus distinct from movement expansion, with the former more common than the latter. Movements tend to expand their representation through some type of coalition work, rather than by extending their contours to encompass new identity groups.65 Most social movement organizations cooperate in some way with other groups to increase their visibility, flexibility, and efficiency.66 Through cooperation, organizations can mobilize more people, adopt diverse tactics, and appear in a wider array of forums.67 Where organizations share costs, groups may be able to engage in activities they otherwise could not or conserve their resources for other work.68 At the same time, cooperating with others can be a risky   62. See GOLUBOFF, supra note 49, at 11. The Civil Rights movement addressed educational issues in the 1940s, but this subject did not dominate its agenda until the 1950s. See, e.g., Sweatt v.

Groups represent a range of constituents and concerns, and therefore have different priorities and ideological commitments.69 The gulf between movement expansion and coalition work centers around identity. Social movements are “organized groups and individuals cooperating, to some degree, on a set of common issues.”70 However, “[s]ocial movements are diverse affairs, made up of many organizations, loose networks, and individuals that do not always neatly fit together.”71 What allows these varied components to merge is a collective identity that creates a cohesive movement.72 Thus, collective identities form from “a shared sense of ‘one-ness’ or ‘we-ness,’”73 that allows movement members to see one another as “similar in kind.”74 As much as a collective identity forms around ties that bind, it is also based on recognizing a clear boundary that divides the group from outsiders.75 Collective identity formation is “by nature oppositional to dominant cultural practices,” such that shared attributes and goals may be a function of how outsiders situate the group members.76 Movement members’ shared identity—and their sense of identity- based differences from others—help explain why movements working on similar issues do not unite. Racial justice groups, including African American civil rights organizations and Latinx advocates, have often engaged in related, if not identical, law reform projects.77 The aims of   69.

First, decision makers may be unwilling to support the rights of the more unpopular coalition members, and second, opponents may generate arguments that more effectively target those on the periphery.

For example, efforts to desegregate 16Florida Law Review, Vol. 73, Iss. 2 [2021], Art. 1https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol73/iss2/12021] EXPANDING LGBT 259  these social movements have overlapped for decades, ranging from efforts to overturn Jim Crow laws that targeted both African Americans and Mexicans, to contemporary struggles against racial profiling by law enforcement.78 However, the work of these legal movements proceeded as “two separate civil rights struggles [that] occurred simultaneously” in large part because of their different collective identities, which developed in distinct social, political, and legal contexts.79 The movements’ own conceptions of their racial identities, combined with social and legal hierarchies that impose race-based differences on the groups, have substantially impeded calls for multiracial coalitions.80 At the same time, the work of one has promoted the rights of the other; Equal Protection principles, for example, prohibit race-based categorizations without distinguishing among racial minorities.81 Although identity is a necessary factor for movement expansion, it is not sufficient. Choices as to goals and tactics may strain alliances by favoring a more moderate or radical approach, given that movement members fall along a wide ideological spectrum.82 Thus, the fight for racial justice has seen both the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, while struggles for gender equality have taken the form of lobbying for equality, equity, and antisubordination mechanisms.83 Many lesbian feminist groups broke off from the gay liberation movement in the 1970s  because they sought to prioritize lesbian-specific issues.84 During the AIDS crisis, these organizations banded together to combat the epidemic and have since remained a united movement.85   schools have clashed with bilingual education advocacy.

Thus, in the nineteenth century, abolitionists and suffragists worked together to expand the right to vote, but when the Fifteenth Amendment only enfranchised African American men, the coalition fell apart.89 The groups’ lack of identity-based connections l e d  t o  the coalition’s dissolution.90 A counterexample comes from 2014, when the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) provided extensive support—hundreds of thousands of dollars in staff time and salaries, web development, fundraising, and legal fees—to Keep Fayetteville Fair, a local campaign to maintain the Arkansas city’s sexual orientation and gender identity antidiscrimination law.91 However, HRC and local activists clashed over strategy, and the next year, when the issue arose again, local groups waged the campaign on their own.92 The coalition’s fracture did not rupture the larger legal movement, which is held together by its collective identity. Identity is therefore a prerequisite to social movement formation, but strategic decisions as to goals and tactics are also essential factors. These insights from social movement theory help explain why, when, and how the LGBT movement formed, as the next section explains. It also indicates the prospects for national organizations’ expansion to include nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights, which Parts II–IV address.   86. See Kretschmer, supra note 51, at 895.  87.

Becoming LGBT The LGBT movement has experienced both expansions and contractions, with identity and strategy playing key roles in both types of changes. “LGBT” came into being when gay and lesbian rights organizations expanded in the late 1990s and early 2000s to include transgender individuals and their concerns.93 The gay and lesbian rights movement had previously tightened its once-loose boundaries when it clarified that pedophile rights activists were not part of their advocacy coalition.94 The major marker of that change occurred in 1994, when the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) ousted a member organization called the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA).95 Other movement organizations resoundingly supported the ILGA’s decision, in large part because they saw the groups as distinct as a matter of identity. Strategic concerns also played a role, in that gay and lesbian rights advocates struggled to refute their opponents’ accusations of pedophilia given NAMBLA’s presence.96 The LGBT movement’s very creation is a case study in the challenges of merging disparate identity groups.97 Initially, many gay and lesbian rights advocates and community leaders questioned whether they were tied to transgender individuals in terms of identity. As one commentator explained: “Many transgender people are heterosexual; most gay people have no internal conflict with their own gender. It remains important to insist that, just because so many in the gay world have been browbeaten into repeating the concept of an ‘LGBT community,’ that doesn’t mean it exists.”98 Another was more explicit, asking: “What do I have in common with a guy who wants to remove his willy, grow breasts, become a woman and get married to a man? From where did this relatively new concept of ‘the LGBT community’ come?”99 Some lesbian feminists additionally objected to transgender identity, claiming transgender   93.

These advocates did not distinguish between pedophilia as an identity category and pedophilia as an act, a distinction that contemporary groups make.

At the same time that gay and lesbian rights groups debated whether LG and T shared an identity, strategic concerns also impeded organizations’ willingness to expand. Advocates feared that movement expansion might undermine their assimilationist arguments.103 Gay and lesbian rights successes had depended on appeals to respectability and conformity to middle-class norms.104 This assimilationist approach emphasized that LGBT individuals only differed from heterosexuals in the gender of their sexual partners.105 For example, marriage equality litigation succeeded by casting same-sex couples as quintessential American heads of households, who shared carpooling, PTA, and dog- walking responsibilities like their suburban counterparts.106 When selecting gay and lesbian plaintiffs, attorneys sought those that were most   100.

A prime example comes from 2007, when the U.S. House of Representatives debated the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).113 Gay and lesbian rights advocates had lobbied for federal employment protections since the 1970s, and the law was on the cusp of passing in the House when representatives balked at also providing federal protections based on gender identity.114 Most LGBT rights organizations refused to support a sexual orientation-only version of the bill, which representatives were willing to enact.115 In the more than a decade since, the House has never again voted on employment discrimination protections based on sexual orientation or   107.

Before marriage equality, some courts voided the unions of post-operative transgender individuals as illegal same-sex marriages.120 Additionally, legislators who were hesitant to enact transgender rights protections nevertheless approved gender identity antidiscrimination laws because they were part and parcel of a larger bill that provided sexual orientation protections.121 Without protections for gays and lesbians, legislatures likely would not have enacted the transgender rights provisions. The deprioritization of transgender rights was linked to the fact that gays and lesbians are LGBT rights organizations’ largest constituency, biggest donors, and most significant source of volunteer labor, giving them more authority over agenda setting.122 Many within the movement saw transgender individuals as benefiting disproportionately from their   116.

Beginning in 2012, opponents of LGBT rights succeeded in repealing antidiscrimination protections based on both sexual orientation and gender identity by emphasizing the dangers that transgender individuals posed.128 LGBT rights groups could have changed their legislative approach to seek only sexual orientation protections—which would have effectively undermined their opponents’ arguments—but they instead continued to pursue comprehensive laws.129 Similarly, because of concerns over transgender rights, three states enacted preemption laws that prohibited municipalities from enacting any antidiscrimination provision that expanded protections beyond what the state law encompassed.130 These statutes eliminated local ordinances prohibiting discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity.131 Although countermobilization has contoured the LGBT movement’s work, it has not led to fracture.

National LGBT organizations have avoided any radical reconfiguration of their tactics, while expanding their agenda to include transgender-specific issues. However, they have done so with strategies that have divided the transgender community, as the next Part explains. That discussion reinforces that movement expansion may require new members to acculturate to the movement as much as the movement changes to accommodate new members. II.  QUEER National LGBT rights groups have expanded their mandates in the past and now face the question of whether to do so again. These next three Parts therefore move from the history of the LGBT movement to debates over its future, with each taking up nonbinary, intersexuality, and asexuality, respectively. Each Part first explains the identity category before analyzing whether, when, and how these categories intersect with LGBT as a matter of identity and strategy.132132The Parts then turn to paradigmatic rights issues for nonbinary, intersex, and asexual advocates to illustrate the ways in which LGBT and QIA intersect in law reform efforts. This Part focuses on nonbinary issues, which have a clear identity- based connection to the LGBT legal movement because a substantial minority of transgender individuals identify as nonbinary. Indeed, some of national organizations’ legal work on transgender rights has benefited nonbinary individuals. However, national legal groups have secured these gains through strategies that have often excluded nonbinary individuals. National groups have also largely ignored nonbinary-specific interests. The dissonance between the identity-based connections and the goals that national organizations have pursued exemplifies the organizations’ long-   132. Although this Article discusses tensions between LGBT and QIA, it is important to note that the groups overwhelmingly share core values and assumptions that shape their views as to appropriate goals and arguments. See Clarke, supra note 19, at 900. The categories are fundamentally aligned in their ideology, which challenges normative conceptions of sexual orientation, sex, and gender. Cf. id. (noting that analysis of various legal contexts shows fewer conflicts among LGBT coalition members than there appear to be at first blush). For that reason, nonbinary individuals would contest the claims of LGBT rights opponents, who cite a range of concerns: In the case of marriage equality, maintaining tradition and protecting children from inappropriate role models; for transgender rights, fraud and the practical difficulties of recognizing more than two genders. See Suzanne B. Goldberg, Essay, Risky Arguments in Social-Justice Litigation: The Case of Sex Discrimination and Marriage Equality, 114 COLUM. L.

A.  Defining Nonbinary Nonbinary people have a gender identity that does not fit the traditional categories of male or female.133 Examples of nonbinary identity include those who combine elements of both genders, as well as those who reject gender in its entirety and thus appear unisex or gender neutral.134 Nonbinary individuals may also have a fluid gender, meaning their gender is not consistently male or female, or they may identify as a third gender category, such as two-spirit (First Nations), hijra (India), and māhū (Hawaii).135 The terms that nonbinary people use to self-identify vary and include genderqueer, agender, androgynous, third gender, and multigender.136 Nonbinary individuals are often invisible; they typically allow others to assume they are male or female since nonbinary “is often dismissed as not being a real identity.”137 The majority of nonbinary individuals also avoid asking their employers to use their preferred pronouns—often they, them, and theirs—out of fear of discrimination.138 Nonbinary may be considered a subset of transgender identity insofar as transgender individuals are people whose gender identity differs from their gender assigned at birth, although not all nonbinary individuals identify as transgender.139 “Transgender” is a term that emerged in the early 1990s to denote many different types of gender variant individuals, including individuals who sought gender confirmation surgery, people who transitioned without medical interventions, and those who identified as nonbinary.140 Before that time, there were three primary social identity options for gender variants: transsexuals, heterosexual transvestites, or gay female impersonators.141 Transsexuals were those who sought to express their feminine gender identity through hormones and surgery, while transvestites were those whose attire subverted gender norms but   133.

Within the transgender community, a substantial subset identifies as nonbinary.146 In the most recent survey of transgender individuals in the United States, most identified as either male or female, but more than one-third identified as nonbinary.147 Today, approximately 0.6% of Americans are transgender, which means that an estimated 0.2% of that population is nonbinary.148 Applied to current population statistics, there are more than 700,000 nonbinary Americans—about the same as the population of Washington, D.C.149 These figures are likely underestimations, since the survey likely did not capture nonbinary   142.

Both report disproportionately high rates of discrimination, but those who do not conform to gender norms are more likely than their gender conforming counterparts to suffer stigma, discrimination, and violence, particularly in sex-segregated spaces.152 Moreover, nonbinary youth report disproportionate rates of low self-esteem, as well as high levels of anxiety and depression.153 The harms that nonbinary individuals suffer indicate the extent to which gender nonconformity generates discomfort, fear, disgust, and offense, creating a social hierarchy in which gender nonconforming individuals are often rejected.154 Perhaps because of this social hierarchy, nonbinary individuals face “denied access, verbal harassment, and physical assault” when entering sex segregated facilities.155 In a survey of Washington, D.C. gender nonconforming individuals, 70% reported experiencing problems accessing or using public restrooms.156 Nonbinary individuals are less likely to be accepted in sex-segregated spaces than gender conforming individuals, and they are also more likely to experience harassment when they attempt to access public restrooms.157 To help “pass” in restrooms,   150.

Yet LGBT organizations’ decision to add “Q” to their names is indicative of the important distinctions between transgender and nonbinary rights. This linguistic shift is a reminder of the historical debates over whether and how LGBT rights groups would represent transgender legal issues,160 in that organizations resolved the strategic tension by focusing on the gender conforming members of the transgender community.161 Thus, although the national LGBT movement coalesced because all of the identity groups were discriminated against when they violated gender norms, the organizations’ approach depended on minimizing this difference between the straight and queer worlds. Were national LGBT rights groups to include nonbinary interests, they could no longer adopt the same strategy. Nonbinary individuals are inherently gender nonconforming and undermine the notion that society should organize itself according to gender. As a result, nonbinary interests would change the terms of the debates over transgender rights, which have converged over the issue of biology. Opponents have argued that there is an essential difference between individuals who have had gender confirmation surgery and those who have not.162 The question therefore centers on where to draw the boundary between the sexes, rather than whether a line needs to exist at all.163 Nonbinaryindividuals, on the other hand, dispute that there is a meaningful distinction between sex and gender, and they question whether either is socially or legally significant.164 Nonbinary identity does not require abolishing gender or making society entirely gender-  LESBIAN, & STRAIGHT EDUCATOR NETWORK, THE 2017 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY 96 (2018).  158.

However, opponents have deployed the argument that nonbinary rights would result in “enforced androgyny,” which is a different claim than the one appearing in battles over rights for gender conforming transgender individuals.165 Nonbinary rights advocacy may therefore give rise to new forms of countermobilization that might impede LGBT rights claims. At the same time, because nonbinary individuals subvert gender norms, nonbinary rights advances would likely promote the rights of bisexuals, a group that national LGBT rights groups have tended to ignore. Bisexuals undermine assumptions about gender because they do not require that their partners belong to one gender or another, they may be attracted to all genders, or they may reject the notion that gender is relevant to sexual attraction.166 For those reasons, arguments on behalf of bisexuals may be useful in promoting nonbinary rights and vice-versa. Notably, the LGBT movement has elided bisexual identity in its law reform efforts for the same tactical reasons that organizations have overlooked the gender nonconformists in their ranks.167 Bisexuality poses several additional strategic problems for LGBT that nonbinary identity augments, rather than resolves. Both nonbinary identity and bisexuality seem to detract from movement arguments about immutability,168 a factor essential to obtain heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.169 Both bisexuality and nonbinary identity are immutable in the sense that they are fundamental expressions of identity that no one should be asked to change.170 However, opponents may characterize those self-expressions as mere matters of choice, which are undeserving of legal protections.171 Given that arguments about the immutability of both sexual orientation and gender identity have been central to the LGBT movement’s rights advances, detractors from these claims are particularly problematic for advocates.172 Notably, immutability is now more important as a matter of public policy than   165.

Incorporating nonbinary people might consequently reinforce the place of bisexuals, as well as that of gender nonconforming gays and lesbians whose identity served as the basis for the LGBT movement in the first place. C.  Rights Work The strategic gap between LGBT and nonbinary helps explain why there are currently national LGBT rights organizations rather than LGBTQ ones. Although many movement members do not see LGBT and nonbinary as distinct, national organizations often treat nonbinary as an outside group because of strategic concerns, indicating the importance of   173. See David Schraub, The Siren Song of Strict Scrutiny, 84 UMKC L. REV. 859, 860 (2016). LGBT rights groups once considered immutability the “holy grail” of constitutional law, as an immutable trait constitutes an essential prerequisite for suspect classification status under Equal Protection doctrine. Id.; see also Clarke, supra note 170, at 4 (identifying immutability as one common factor in equal protection analysis). Immutability now appears to have less valence, given that the Supreme Court identified same-sex sexual attraction as an immutable characteristic but did not apply heightened scrutiny in reviewing bans on same-sex marriage.

See JAMES ET AL., supra note 119, at 44 (showing that some survey participants self- identify as “Third gender,” “Bi-gender,” “Butch,” or other genders that indicate that sex and gender are relevant to their identities).  177.

REV. 2087, 2133 (2014) (noting courts’ aversion to finding sex discrimination in LGBT cases and noting that “it is almost as though there is an internalized sense . . . that if sex-based rules were not tolerated on occasion, we would all wind up in unisex tunics, having lost our sexed and gendered bearings”). 30Florida Law Review, Vol. 73, Iss. 2 [2021], Art. 1https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/flr/vol73/iss2/12021] EXPANDING LGBT 273  interest convergence in movement composition.178 As this section explains, LGBT rights groups’ work promoting antidiscrimination protections at the state and local levels has produced protections for nonbinary individuals, but through strategies that have marginalized nonbinary identity.179 Additionally, there are nonbinary-specific rights goals that an LGBTQ movement would need to address, requiring organizations to expand their legal agendas. 1.  Antidiscrimination Laws One area that highlights the strategic gulf between LGBT and nonbinary is debates concerning antidiscrimination protections.180 Political conservatives have increasingly targeted transgender rights through state and local referenda, pressing voters to repeal gender identity antidiscrimination protections by arguing the laws will allow men in women’s restrooms.181 To counter these efforts, national LGBT rights organizations have advanced assimilationist arguments that exclude nonbinary identity, demonstrating how political opportunity structure and countermobilization frame advocacy strategies.182 Forover a decade, LGBT rights opponents have managed to repeal sexual orientation and gender identity antidiscrimination laws by arguing that transgender protections offer predators access to women’s restrooms.183 In 2012, rhetoric concerning transgender deviance began featuring prominently in opposition arguments.184 For many years, LGBT rights groups struggled to develop a strategy that would resonate with voters.185 They ultimately settled on the argument that transgender men are men and transgender women are women, a statement that is true for many transgender individuals, but not all.186 The claim is that, because transgender individuals’ self-presentation matched their gender identity, their appearance in any sex-segregated facility associated with their assigned gender at birth would be inappropriate.187 To reinforce the   178.

In those cases, attorneys argued that transgender 31George: Expanding LGBTPublished by UF Law Scholarship Repository, 2021274 FLORIDA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 73  notion that transgender rights do not challenge gender norms, campaigns have featured extremely gender conforming transgender individuals in stereotypical roles, such as a bearded transgender man at work and a young transgender woman in a dress, high heels, and perfect makeup descending a catwalk.188 This approach has been extremely successful. LGBT rights groups won the battles over antidiscrimination repeal measures upon debuting this argument, thereby ending a half-decade losing streak.189 These assimilationist arguments have thus preserved gender identity antidiscrimination laws, which benefit both gender conforming transgender and nonbinary individuals. However, these successes have also come at the cost of reifying the norms that nonbinary individuals challenge.190 Given that nonbinary people are already disproportionately likely to suffer harassment and physical harm when entering public restrooms, the assimilationist approach might aggravate the difficulties that nonbinary individuals already face—and may make their rights more difficult to secure in other forums.191 Notably, debates over transgender bathroom access have resulted in gender nonconforming lesbians being policed in restrooms, highlighting the connection between nonbinary rights and advocacy on behalf of marginalized members of the LGBT community.192 Ignoring nonbinary rights in this context thus also subverts the interests of gender nonconforming gays and lesbians, who are discriminated against because they do not meet traditional expectations of men and women. Part of the  individuals were discriminated against as a result of sex stereotypes concerning how men and women should act. See Naomi Schoenbaum, The New Law of Gender Nonconformity, 105 MINN. L. REV. 831, 836 (2020). As Professor Schoenbaum has noted, this framing reifies a person’s sex assigned at birth. Id. Under sex stereotyping theory “a transgender person designated male at birth is an effeminate man, not a woman; a transgender person designated female at birth is a masculine woman, not a man. This view of the sex of transgender persons is contrary to transgender persons’ own identity.” Id. at 836. However, as David Cruz has demonstrated, Title VII does not require this type of argument. David B. Cruz, Acknowledging the Gender in Anti-Transgender Discrimination, 32 L. & INEQUALITY 257, 263 (2014). Attorneys have nevertheless pursued sex stereotyping arguments, which Schoenbaum argues “amount to a defeat for the broader cause of transgender rights,” because litigators believed these were more likely to succeed. Schoenbaum, supra, at 836. Notably, when the Supreme Court held that Title VII protected individuals against sexual identity discrimination, it did not do so based on sex stereotyping theory, but rather using a textualist analysis.

The choice to foreground gender conforming transgender individuals in ballot measures is a strategic decision that reveals an identity-based difference between gender conforming and nonbinary individuals: one seeks to identify as a specific gender, while the other rejects the relevance of the categories. Thus, although identity brings the groups together and strategy cleaves them apart, these two elements that contour social movement formation are not entirely distinct. 2.  Sex-Segregated Facilities In addition to addressing nonbinary individuals in their general work on transgender rights, incorporating nonbinary rights into national LGBT groups’ agendas would mean tackling nonbinary-specific issues. Much of gender conforming transgender rights advocacy has focused on who will determine an individual’s sex or gender, as opposed to what sex and gender options are available, which is what matters for nonbinary individuals.196 In other words, whether and how a person can change their legal gender is separate from the question of whether the government recognizes nonbinary gender as an alternative to the categories of male   193. See id. at 614.  194. Clarke, supra note 19, at 901, 923.  195. Advocates have also pressed for antidiscrimination protections in the courtroom by arguing that Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses gender identity, but their claims excluded nonbinary individuals entirely. See Suzanne B. Goldberg, Discrimination by Comparison, 120 YALE L.J. 728, 800 n.239 (2011). This is likely because discrimination analysis requires lawyers to use opposite-sex comparators, creating a legal opportunity structure that circumscribes the claims they can put forward.

The issue of what gender designations the government—and society more generally—will recognize is vitally important, as sex-segregated facilities remain prevalent. Restrooms, store dressing rooms, and fitness club locker rooms are predominantly sex-specific, as are homeless shelters, jails, prisons, and immigration detention facilities.198 This separation of men and women is both a social practice and a legal requirement, with zoning regulations mandating segregated spaces in public accommodations and police enforcing the divisions.199 Youth may confront this issue more often, given that school admissions may be limited by gender,200 as are living spaces in residence halls and extracurricular activities, particularly sports.201   197.

First, the strategic concerns that have led organizations to focus on gender conforming transgender individuals when promoting antidiscrimination laws apply with equal force in this context.215 It is exponentially more challenging to question sex segregation than to make an argument concerning who fits into which sex-based category.216 Second, much like antidiscrimination law battles, arguing against sex- segregated facilities could lend credence to opposition arguments, thereby hampering the ability to secure gains for gender conforming transgender individuals.217 Third, advocates face important legal barriers to presenting these claims, including statutory protections for sex- differentiated facilities and legal precedent that recognizes innate differences between males and females.218 In other words, the opportunity to present nonbinary inclusive arguments may be limited.219 Finally, many members within the LGBT community identify and appear as either male or female.220 As a result, bathroom access is less of a pressing issue than other legal matters. This lack of interest convergence between LGBT and Q may preclude a more expansive movement from taking hold.221 In their transgender law reform efforts, LGBT rights organizations have propounded arguments and solutions that have often marginalized nonbinary concerns and ignored nonbinary-specific issues.222 For that   214.

Yet nonbinary has a clear identity-based connection that supports its inclusion in the movement, since gender nonconformity was what gave rise to LGBT organizations in the first place. Advocates at the movement’s founding recognized the strategic tensions that movement expansion created, but they have yet to confront that issue. These strategic concerns are not limited to nonbinary individuals, but rather implicate many of the gender nonconformists who are LGBT. Nonbinary inclusion thus raises broader questions concerning whether and how national LGBT rights groups may advocate for their more marginalized members. III.  INTERSEX Intersexuality’s connection to LGBT is less immediately obvious than nonbinary’s. Intersexuality is a physical designation, rather than a sexual orientation or gender identity. However, because the non-normative nature of intersex bodies challenges the naturalness of the sexual binary, intersex, nonbinary, and transgender rights advocates have been natural allies in some of their reform efforts. At the same time, intersex and transgender rights advocates offer different—and sometimes conflicting—conceptions of the relationship between sex and gender identity, which has given rise to conflicting legal goals. Thus, intersex rights intersect with LGBT interests in multiple and inconsistent ways. A.  Defining Intersex Intersex is an umbrella term for various conditions in which common sex indicators, such as genitals, gonads, or chromosomes, do not clearly establish an individual as male or female.223 Intersex is therefore a physiological designation, not a gender identity or sexual orientation. Intersex individuals may identify their gender as male, female, or nonbinary; and their sexual orientation as heterosexual, gay, bisexual, or something else.224 Thus, individuals may self-identify as any combination of L, G, B, T, Q, and intersex,225 although many with intersex conditions may not identify as intersex because of the secrecy and shame associated with nonnormative physical bodies.226   223.

For example, as a result of Klinefelter Syndrome, affected males have XXY chromosomes and produce a reduced quantity of testosterone.228 The condition is often so mild that it is not diagnosed until puberty, if it is ever recognized at all.229 Hyperandrogenism, a condition that produces higher-than-normal levels of androgens in females, and that has threatened Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya’s career, is likewise typically discovered in adolescence.230 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), on the other hand, produces masculinized genitals among chromosomally female infants as a result of their exposure to higher-than-normal levels of androgen during gestation.231 A CAH infant with XX chromosomes, ovaries, and a uterus may have a large clitoris that looks like a penis, or may have labia majora joined together that resemble a scrotum.232 With the wide range of intersex conditions and their effects, the rate of intersexuality in the population is difficult to estimate.233 When all chromosomal, anatomical, and hormonal exceptions to dimorphic sex are combined, the frequency of intersexuality may be as high as 1.7%.234 That rate is similar to the likelihood of having red hair and makes intersexuality significantly more common than Down Syndrome or Albinism.235 However, only a much smaller proportion of intersex infants  GROWING MOVEMENT ADVANCING THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF INTERSEX PEOPLE 27 (2016) (noting that few intersex individuals identify themselves publicly for fear of stigma and harassment).  227.

From the 1950s to the 1990s, medical providers immediately intervened in these situations, surgically altering the infant’s appearance to produce the best cosmetic result.238 They focused on appearance, rather than functionality, in large part to help children self-identify with—and assist parents treat their child as—their assigned gender.239 Doctors argued for medical interventions because they assumed that sex and gender necessarily correlated, such that surgery would promote children’s gender identity development as male or female.240 Thus, the surgeries reflected medical providers’ beliefs regarding the interrelationship between sex and gender. In 2005, after more than a decade of lobbying by intersex rights advocates, medical professionals revised their approach to intersexuality. That year, they published the Consensus Statement on Management of Intersex Disorders, which set forth a new standard of care.241 The statement emphasized that all individuals should be assigned a gender,  There in the World?, BBC NEWS (Oct. 2, 2013), https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24331615 [https://perma.cc/J2RE-FB2B]; Jen Thomas, Down Syndrome: Facts, Statistics, and You, HEALTHLINE (May 13, 2019), https://www.healthline.com/health/down-syndrome/down- syndrome-facts#1 [https://perma.cc/FKC5-PL73]; Oculocutaneous Albinism, NAT’L INST.

Clinicians have changed their practices by leaving the decision to the parents, rather than making a recommendation.244 However, doctors’ positive portrayals of the surgeries’ benefits and outcomes, as well as their inability or unwillingness to present other options, tend to convince otherwise undecided parents.245 Scientists tend to ignore research demonstrating the harm of early surgical interventions and the complaints of intersex adults, dismissing both as the product of outdated surgical methods.246 Since the consensus statement, doctors’ justifications for the surgery have shifted away from gender-identity formation and toward alleviating stigma. Physicians now explain that the interventions promote “psychosocial well-being” in that “normal” looking genitals will assuage the child’s sense of difference.247 Doctors often express concern that parents, family members, and care providers will be uncomfortable with the infant’s physical difference, leading the child to suffer from the resulting isolation.248 Therefore, although intersex identity is biological   242.

B.  Connections Between Intersex and LGBT Intersex normalizing surgeries are a problem specific to intersex individuals, but the motivations for these surgical interventions demonstrate the identity-based connections between LGBT, Q, and I. Intersex people generally embody the argument that sex is not neatly defined by a set of binary traits. Moreover, intersex individuals highlight that legal standards for male and female are false constructions because they demand coherence among a range of potentially inconsistent chromosomes, hormones, and phenotypes.249 The immutable fact of intersex bodies thus challenges the naturalness of sex designations, which connects intersex and transgender interests. The link between T and I is complicated, however, because intersexuality also supports the notion that gender identity, rather than physicality, is key. Most gender conforming transgender individuals concur that gender identity is essential, but many also emphasize the importance of its physical manifestation. Most transgender individuals either have had or eventually want to have some type of medical treatment so their physical bodies conform to their gender identity.250 The groups’ different views on the necessity of surgery thus reflects their divergent perspectives on gender identity formation. Intersex interests overlap as much with nonbinary rights as with transgender issues. Both intersex and nonbinary rights advocates insist that dimorphic gender is unnecessary. As sociologist Georgiann Davis explained: “Intersex is a problem because it disrupts the traditional gender order. If our behaviors weren’t constrained by gender, if opportunities weren’t filtered through gender, and if gender weren’t tied to bodies and identities, it is doubtful that intersex would be as problematic throughout the world as it is today.”251 Since intersex surgery explicitly relies on promoting gender norms and stereotypes, intersex rights advocates have argued that greater acceptance of nonnormative gender identities would likely reduce surgical interventions. Thus, Organization Intersex International (OII), an intersex advocacy group founded in 2003, argues that—since gender is a spectrum and the gender assignment of an infant   249.

Some doctors have taken this heterosexual imperative to an extreme. For example, a doctor at Mount Sinai treated pregnant women likely to have CAH-affected fetuses with an experimental drug—without their informed consent—all to prevent intersex girls’ “tomboyism and lesbianism.”254 The doctor’s unregistered drug trial, which began in the mid-1980s and lasted for more than two decades, exposed fetuses to steroids for weeks before genetic tests could confirm that the drug would have any effect.255 Because the parents were only carriers of the CAH gene, seven out of eight of the women were likely taking the medication unnecessarily.256 The parents were not told of the drug’s side effects, which included developmental delays, memory problems, and stunted growth.257 That children’s heterosexuality matters so much for doctors demonstrates one of the strategic ties that binds LGB and I.258 However, the more significant connection between LGBT and intersex rights stems from the fact that intersex identity disputes the naturalness of sex designations and undermines the notion that gender identity necessarily   252.

Their trepidation stems in part from not wanting to be seen as different, as well as concern that the public will conflate intersex and transgender, rather than appreciate the similarities that connect the two distinct identity groups.

As a result, intersex advocacy challenges both the sexual and gender binary, much like gender nonconforming members of the LGB community, as well as transgender and nonbinary individuals. Thus, like nonbinary identity, intersexuality’s connections are with the more marginalized members of the LGBT community. C.  Rights Work Although there are important connections between each of LGBT, Q, and I, intersex rights work most often overlaps with transgender and nonbinary rights issues. There, the identity groups’ different perceptions of how gender identity and physicality relate has produced divergent efforts around medical regulations, even as their shared challenge of the sexual binary has led to synergies in advocating for reforms of identity document regulations. The strategic relationship between intersex and transgender is therefore multivalent, belying easy categorization. 1.  Medical Regulations In their reform efforts around medical regulations, intersex and transgender rights advocates have pursued opposing goals. Intersex rights advocates have sought to limit medical interventions through legislative lobbying and litigation work, seeing some success in recent years.259 In 2018, for example, California enacted a resolution calling upon the health professions to “defer[] medical or surgical intervention, as warranted, until the child is able to participate in decisionmaking.”260 A resolution does not have the force of law and therefore does not prohibit the surgeries; its purpose is instead to raise awareness, foster dialogue, and convey a legislative perspective.261 However, the expressive power of laws should not be understated, as they may foster new normative commitments in favor of minority groups.262 For example, the conversion   259.

However, the law’s supporters ignored ISNA’s appeals, and the law included an exemption for “medically necessary” operations, which was meant to permit intersex genital surgeries.

When Connecticut considered a law on intersex rights that, among other provisions, would have created a task force to determine when intersex infant surgery was “medically necessary,”264 physicians and parents of intersex individuals testified in opposition.265 The committee eliminated all references to the task force in the bill it presented to the full Senate; the revised proposal simply specified that intersex-based discrimination was impermissible under state law and added an intersex gender designation option on birth certificates and driver’s licenses.266 Both Nevada and California considered prohibitions on infant intersex surgeries, but these failed for similar reasons as the Connecticut proposal.267 The bills would have mandated informed consent from the intersex patient, although they contained a carve-out for medically necessary procedures, defined respectively as a delay that would “endanger the life of the child”268 and a situation where surgery could not be “safely deferred until the intersex minor can provide informed consent.”269 CAH individuals and their families opposed the bans,270 arguing that performing surgery reduces stress and anxiety for children and parents, and early interventions prevent the children from  148 U.

However, for intersex rights groups like interACT, CAH-based arguments ignore the needs and rights of the children who would not have consented to the surgery.273 InterACT’s argument stresses that gender identity is key, and physicality is a secondary issue that individuals may seek to address later, or not at all.274 Intersex rights advocates have supported their legislative lobbying with malpractice suits against doctors who perform infant surgeries.275 In 2017, the adoptive parents of an intersex child sued his treating physicians, ultimately settling for more than $400,000.276 Medical malpractice cases do more than compensate intersex individuals; they may produce broader changes to medical standards of care because of their effect on insurance companies.277 Insurance companies impose limitations on their policies as a result of litigation costs; as a result, they may not cover all procedures that professional medical associations endorse.278 Health and liability insurers then enforce compliance with these guidelines either as a condition of coverage or by increasing insurance premiums for noncomplying physicians.279 The prospect of   271.

The tension between the two lies in the fact that advocates are making opposite arguments about whether surgical interventions are medically necessary or appropriate for an individual to identify as a member of one sex or another. For transgender individuals, surgery is not cosmetic but rather a central means of creating gender identity cohesion; for intersex rights advocates arguing against infant surgeries, gender identity is able to form irrespective of physicality.294 The central question that shapes these debates is whether individuals’ physical appearance must conform to their gender identity to promote their health and welfare, with the groups propounding different conceptions of sex and gender identity. 2.

Reducing medical authority has been a concern for LGB individuals and asexuals, but intersex, gender conforming transgender, and nonbinary advocates have been particularly focused on reducing the medical profession’s authority over their lives. For example, one of the gay liberation movement’s first targets was the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) classification of homosexuality as a mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), which served to justify government discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Both transgender and intersex rights advocates are invested in altering the requirements for changing an individual’s gender designation on identity documents, as well as convincing states to offer a nonbinary gender option. In this area of law, the arguments of transgender and intersex advocates are not just related but mutually constitutive. Inaccurate gender markers on legal documentation have a significant impact on transgender, nonbinary, and intersex individuals. Birth certificates are required for many important services, including determining work eligibility, registering for school, obtaining professional certifications, and accessing public benefits.296 Without correct identification, individuals may be denied entitlements and accused of fraud.297 Identification also determines access to binary sex- segregated spaces, as Section II.C discussed. For decades, medicine has been a limiting factor for those seeking to amend their gender identity markers. States have allowed individuals to modify the gender on their birth certificates and driver’s licenses since the 1970s, but these early laws required gender confirmation surgery.298 After decades of lobbying by transgender rights advocates, many states eliminated the surgical requirement but replaced it with proof of clinical treatment.299 As a result, medical providers continue to serve as gatekeepers, a significant problem for an underinsured group.

First, they have lobbied for personal attestations of gender identity to serve as the sole requirement for amending the gender designation on identity documents.300 In other words, they seek to cut out the medical middleman. Second, they have asked officials to offer a nonbinary gender marker alternative.301 The argument for the latter change is that gender is neither dimorphic nor contingent on treatment, while the argument for the former is that many transgender individuals do not obtain medical interventions due to financial barriers and personal preferences.302 The results have been steady, but not all states have embraced both prongs of the project.303 As of January 2021, eighteen states and the District of Columbia have eliminated the medical attestation requirement and added nonbinary gender designation options for birth certificates and/or driver’s licenses.304 Four additional states offer nonbinary gender options but   300.

One small word that does not define, but can confine, someone for the rest of their life.”307 Intersex advocacy in this space is particularly important, as jurists and the public alike are more likely to respond to arguments based on innate characteristics, making intersex plaintiffs appear more sympathetic—and legitimate.308 Many opponents of the legal changes express concern about dissimulation and fraud, but these objections are less potent in the intersex context.309 Intersexuality also undermines opponents’ arguments against the laws, as the responses to the Washington Department of Health’s proposed rule to offer nonbinary options on birth certificates reveal. The Department received more than 500 public comments on the matter, with slightly more than half opposed to the change.310 The reason opponents pressed most frequently was that male and female were immutable biological categories, defined by chromosomes and imprinted in DNA.311 Some commentators further justified their views by emphasizing the difference between sex and gender, with one summarizing the point with the statement: “Sex is determined by genetics. Everything else is behavior.”312 Since birth certificates record sex, not gender, they argued, the state should not permit changes or nonbinary options.313 The very   306.

Because of their different histories, intersex individuals have sought to limit medical interventions, while transgender individuals have pressed for expanded access to care. Those divergent goals reflect that the groups conceptualize gender identity differently. At the same time, the identity groups are united in their efforts to change the laws around identity designations on legal documents. Just as with nonbinary rights, intersex inclusion in the LGBT umbrella creates questions around both identity and strategy. IV.  ASEXUAL Unlike intersex and nonbinary, the LGBT legal movement has not undertaken any representation of asexual rights. Asexuality’s status as a nonnormative sexual orientation means that asexuals share a key identity trait with lesbians, gays, and bisexuals. However, asexuality is based on a lack of sexual desire, making it categorically different from the other groups, whose sexual orientation is characterized by the gender of their sexual partners.315 Moreover, discrimination that asexual individuals, or aces, endure may not be immediately clear to observers, and their lack of sexual desire seems to implicitly repudiate the sex-positivity that the LGBT movement embraces. The identity-based connection between asexuality and LGBT therefore does not align neatly, while their legal goals reveal strategic tensions. These dual challenges help explain why asexuality is the least integrated among QIA. A.  Defining Asexuality Aces are generally not sexually attracted to others and therefore do not desire to engage in sexual activities.316 This lack of sexual attraction is what distinguishes asexuality and celibacy, which implies a repressed desire. Asexuality’s intrinsic nature is why aces identify it as a sexual   314. See Rules Comment, WASH.

Other identity groups seeking inclusion in the LGBT movement, such as polyamory, have also rooted their arguments in their sexual orientation-based connection. See, e.g., Ann E.

Asexuality includes gray-asexuals, meaning individuals who identify as being in the space between sexual and asexual.319 One of the major categories of gray-asexuality is demi-sexuality, which refers to individuals who only experience sexual attraction when they form a strong emotional bond with another person.320 In the most recent survey of major asexual communities, 64.5% of respondents identified as asexual, 10.8% as gray-asexual, 8.6% as demi-sexual, 10.7% as questioning, and the remaining 5.5% as “none of the above.”321 Sexual attraction is distinct from romantic attraction and sexual experience, which are additional factors that contour ace identity. Aces may form romantic relationships that involve physical intimacy, such as cuddling and kissing, which is often directed at a particular gender.322 The “split attraction” model leads many asexuals to separate their sexual and romantic attractions, such that asexuals may also identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or heterosexual.323 An asexual who seeks romantic relationships with members of the same-sex might thus identify as a “homoromantic” asexual.324 Despite their lack of sexual interest, aces may be sexually active, often to “seem normal” or because of their partners’ desires.325 In a recent community survey, 30.2% of asexuals reported having had consensual sexual experiences, with most explaining that this was “to please their partner.”326   317.

The difficulty in estimating the asexual population comes partly from the variations within asexuality, as well as the inability to rely upon self-identification.330 Research has demonstrated that aces do not necessarily self-identify as asexual, or they may do so inconsistently; in one study, almost half of those who selected “asexual” when presented with a series of options did not write in “asexual” when previously asked to fill in a blank with their sexual orientation.331 Additionally, given aces’ romantic attraction, aces may self-identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual, rather than asexual.332 Beyond having overlapping identities, aces’ inconsistent self- identification may be the product of asexuality’s relatively recent emergence as an identity category. Asexual adults overwhelmingly report not having heard of the identity category before their late teens and therefore grew up asking themselves if there was “something wrong” with them.333 Like LGBT, nonbinary, and intersex individuals, aces also have the experience of “coming out,” although perhaps with less institutional support available than the other identity groups.

B.  Connections Between Asexuality and LGBT Although aces may be homoromantic or biromantic, as well as gender conforming transgender or nonbinary, LGBT and asexual rights organizations are distinct and separate.335 Most asexuals do not participate in LGBT organizations or activities, such as frequenting queer clubs or attending pride parades.336 Indeed, many aces report that LGBT spaces are not “intended for them”337 because LGBT communities often center around celebrations of sexuality.338 Although the LGBT movement’s focus on sexual liberation receded during the AIDS crisis, with bathhouses giving way to preschools as the quintessential symbols of gay and lesbian life, sexual freedom continues to form a core part of the LGBT movement’s identity.339 Pride parades are known for their overt displays of sexuality, serving as a reminder that sexual attraction is a defining characteristic of LGB identity.340 The identity-based tension between the asexual movement, which questions the vitality and naturalness of sexuality, and the LGBT movement, which has pressed to have its sexual expression respected, should not be overstated.341   335.

In a survey of aces, almost one-third reported having experienced verbal or online harassment because of their identity, and more than 45% had been told to seek help or had others attempt to cure them.343 Bias against asexuality is pronounced, even though aces are a small subset of the population.344 Attitudes toward asexuals are more negative than those toward gays, lesbians, or bisexuals, reflecting strong prejudice against aces.345 When asked about sexual minorities, respondents are least likely to associate aces with human traits and emotions because of aces’ lack of sexual desire.346 The aversion toward asexuals may be linked to two conflicting and opposite emotions: a distrust derived from lack of understanding, and animus precisely because of its familiarity.347 Cultural preoccupation with sexual availability, desirability, and performance may stem not from the overabundance of sex that individuals are presumed to enjoy, but rather an intense anxiety around its absence.348 Social expectations around sexuality thus foster prejudice against asexuality, which contributes to asexuals’ apprehensions and concerns about their difference. Because of their sexual orientation, aces are targeted for physical and sexual assault, which may take the form of “corrective rape.”349 Julie Decker, an asexual activist, was assaulted as a teenager by a friend who believed she was “in denial” about her sexuality.350 Online commentators have repeatedly told her that she “just needs a ‘good raping,’” thereby reinforcing her assailant’s sentiment—and highlighting a particular source of danger for aces.351 The violence asexuals experience is likely due to a combination of sexual orientation and gender identity, with   342.

A disproportionate percentage of aces identify as neither male nor female, with most describing themselves as nonbinary or agender, and a significant part of the asexual community is transgender.352 Asexuality is therefore a factor that exacerbates these individuals’ already precarious place in society. Despite the discrimination that aces face, many within the LGBT community have expressed skepticism that asexuals truly require protection.353 When journalist and LGBT community activist Dan Savage first saw AVEN marching in the San Francisco pride parade, he dismissed the asexual rights project with the derisive comment that all aces had to do was “stay home, not do anything.”354 Only one sexual orientation antidiscrimination law in the country specifically protects individuals on the basis of asexuality, and legislators only included the provision to argue the law was not a “gay rights” bill.355 The suspicion cast on asexuals mirrors the historical exclusion of bisexuals from the LGBT community, with gays, lesbians, and heterosexuals all questioning whether bisexuality existed and the validity of bisexual discrimination claims.356 Insofar as the two identity categories represent the outer ranges of sexual attraction, from no genders to all genders, they are similarly nonnormative.357 Indeed, asexuality’s inclusion might help reconceptualize sexual orientation more broadly. Alfred Kinsey, whose work has influenced sex research since the mid- twentieth century, represented homosexuality and heterosexuality as opposite ends of a liner scale that spanned from zero to six.358 However,   352. Twenty-six percent of aces in the most recent community survey identified as neither male nor female; in a separate question, 14.8% identified as transgender and 10.9% stated they were unsure whether they identified as transgender.

Thus, although asexuality’s inclusion within the LGBT movement may appear to reduce the coalition’s emphasis on sexual expression, it also reinforces the notion that sexuality is multidimensional, expansive, and complex. In doing so, it draws attention to bisexuality, a sexual orientation that is often excluded from conversations around LGBT rights. C.  Rights Issues Much like nonbinary and intersex individuals, asexuals have several goals that diverge from national LGBT rights advocacy, including the elimination sexual intimacy as a requirement of marriage, reallocation government benefits away from couples to single individuals, and recognition of functional families. National LGBT rights groups are likely to support the first, but not the second, especially in light of the marriage equality movement’s hard-won victory. As for functional family recognition, this rights project has come under fire as a result of the marriage equality victory, rendering the issue fraught for national LGBT rights advocates. Asexual rights projects thus align with the interests of LGBT community members who have not benefited from marriage equality, such that asexual inclusion would reshape national organizations’ rights agendas in significant ways. 1.  Marital Benefits LGBT and asexual interests diverge on the subject of marriage. For aces, traditional marriage definitions fail to meet their needs because they assume sexual intimacy within the marital couple.359 Additionally, the veneration of marriage reinforces the state’s extension of benefits to couples, rather than individuals. As a result, asexuals may in fact prefer a regime in which marriage is no longer the central means through which the government offers benefits. Many within and beyond the LGBT community would also benefit from this type of law reform, with some preferring alternatives to marriage over a marital regime.360  1998).

This victory eliminated a formal inequality in law and provided tangible benefits to hundreds of thousands of LGBTQ couples.361 Marital status is a factor in allocating benefits in more than 1,000 federal statutes, and states also have hundreds of provisions that turn on marriage.362 Some of the more significant of these rights include social security benefits, tort recovery for wrongful death, and tax deductions that reduce tax liability.363 These benefits, along with court-ordered distribution of assets or financial support upon the dissolution of the relationship, are inaccessible to unmarried individuals.364 The marriage equality movement thus brought significant government benefits to many more couples. However, this incredibly important legal change has not benefited all community members, since marriage is demarcated by class, race, and education levels.365 Because white, educated, and wealthier individuals are more likely to marry, a major impetus for functional family recognition is that marriage is exclusionary and a “hallmark of . . . privilege.”366 In one of the only studies of LGBT community attitudes on national advocacy groups, respondents stated they wanted the movement to focus on expanding the categories of families the law would recognize, rather than marriage equality.367 Indeed, an increasing number of couples (of all sexual orientations) are unmarried.368 Nonmarital couples are able to obtain some of the rights associated with marriage, although doing so is more complicated and less secure.  25, 2013), https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/style/gay-couples-choosing-to-say-i-dont.html [https://perma.cc/6EQQ-JCVD] (noting reasons such as religious beliefs, objections to the institution of marriage, and tax benefits).

Many employees—though not the majority—have access to health benefits for domestic partners, whether same- or opposite-sex.370 Insurance companies typically permit policyholders to designate partners as beneficiaries, although they also impose limitations on who may qualify as a domestic partner.371 When those companies engage in ex post determinations of eligibility, evaluating whether an informal relationship qualifies under their policies, partners might not receive the benefits that would have come to them automatically had they been married.372 There are additional considerations that render marriage less salient for aces in particular. Many states recognize impotency as a ground for annulment and fault-based divorce.373 Courts have applied an expansive definition of the term impotency, extending it beyond physical incapacity to incorporate psychological impediments. In the 1985 case of Manbeck v. Manbeck,374 a Pennsylvania court held that the wife’s “psychological or emotional disorder,” which prevented her from engaging in intercourse, was a valid basis for annulling the marriage.375 Other courts have since annulled unconsummated marriages, with one describing the pair as having “acted more as roommates” than a married couple.376 So long as sexual intercourse is a defining characteristic of marriage, aces   369.

The U.S. Tax Code provides breaks to married couples, such that singles may have to pay more income tax than a couple with the same amount of income, although this varies significantly based on individual circumstances.386 Adoption officials often express a preference for couples, and state laws may require them to place children with couples over single parents.387 Surrogacy is sometimes also limited to couples.388 More frequently, singles encounter discrimination when private parties charge couples less on a per person basis, like with employer-provided insurance plans.389 As Professor Nancy Leong has argued, putting such actions “beyond the reach of the law is still a legal decision,” and one that results in singles indirectly subsidizing couples to their detriment.390 Domestic partnerships have offered an alternative to marriage, but domestic partnership requirements tend to replicate marriage rather than provide recognition for alternative household arrangements.391 While requirements vary, domestic partnerships often expect couples to share a primary residence, be committed to mutual support, and evidence financial interdependence.392 Indeed, given how closely domestic partnerships parallel normative ideals of coupled life, some scholars have argued that domestic partnerships allow the state “to create the ideal marriage.”393 That domestic partnerships mirror marriage is not surprising, given that most domestic partner benefits were drafted in what Professor NeJaime has termed a “dialogical relationship” to marriage,   385.

Although national LGBT rights groups generally support alternative family structures, they fought for so long to have LGBT couples recognized that they are unlikely to turn to dismantling the marital regime. That is particularly true given the challenges of convincing legislators to create an alternative system.398 As a result, much like nonbinary and intersex rights advocacy, aces’ goals may be inconsistent with current national LGBT rights organizations’ agendas. However, aces’ divergent interests may nevertheless promote the needs of LGBT movement members, many of whom have not benefited from marriage equality. 2.  Functional Parenthood In another context—functional parenthood recognition—asexual rights goals have an equally complicated relationship to national LGBT rights advocacy strategies. National organizations have promoted functional parenthood doctrines, but these equitable solutions have broken down as a result of the same groups’ marriage equality victories. Thus, national organizations’ greatest success has imposed a significant cost for asexuals and others in nonmarital relationships.   394.

In Ramey v. Sutton,403 for example, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma limited de facto parenthood to those whom the state prevented from marrying.404 Thus, couples who may now wed because of Obergefell v. Hodges405 may no longer rely on functional parenthood arguments in Oklahoma. Similarly, the Oregon Court of Appeals narrowed its interpretation of the state’s artificial insemination statute because of marriage equality.406 In 2009, the court held that the law, which designated a wife’s consenting husband as the child’s legal parent, violated the state constitution’s equal protection clause; it therefore extended the law’s benefit to same-sex partners.407 However, in 2015, the court determined the statute only applied to same-sex couples who would have elected to marry had they been permitted to do so.408 Obergefell’s role in eliminating functional parenthood doctrines stems from its veneration of marriage as the paramount expression of a couple’s commitment and a means of safeguarding children’s best interests.409 Given the Court’s statement that “[n]o union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family,” nonmarital families—almost by definition—fall   399.

Some relationships and reproductive arrangements have led courts to determine that a child has more than two parents, thereby expanding traditional definitions of parentage.414 Tri-parenting arrangements may be planned, in that the parents decide in advance that they will raise the child with more than two parents and seek legal recognition of all of the adults involved.415 Tri-parenting may also arise by default, when the child is the result of an extraconjugal affair or where the intended parents fail to obtain releases from their egg or sperm donors.416 Six states have recognized three legal parents in their common law, although the majority of those situations have involved tri-parenting by default.417 Five additional states have statutes acknowledging that a child may have more than two parents,418 and the Uniform Parentage Act contains a provision recognizing more than two parents.419   410.

In the few published cases in which courts have wrestled with three intended parents, the situations involved same-sex couples and a third parent, with the child conceived through assisted reproductive technology.420 Indeed, because of third-parent recognition’s impact on LGBT families, the NCLR helped draft California’s tri- parenting legislation.421 As for aces, David Jay, an asexual advocate and AVEN’s founder, entered into what was likely the first tri-parenting agreement involving an asexual in 2017.422 As an ace who wanted children, he had for decades considered “form[ing] a committed relationship with a couple and help[ing] them raise one or more children”—a dream that became a possibility as a result of California’s law recognizing third parents.423 Statutory reform recognizing tri-parents is a key component of functional family law reform since courts may not recognize parties’ private tri-parenting agreements in the absence of state authorization. In D.G. v. K.S.,424 a male same-sex couple and their female friend agreed to “conceive and jointly raise a child.”425 The fathers sued for custody after the mother sought to move across the country with the child, but the court held the nonbiological father was not a legal parent.426 The court stated it was “particularly sympathetic” to the nonbiological father’s claims, but that such “social policy choice[s]” should be left to the legislature.427 In such a jurisdiction, David Jay’s parenting agreement would be void—and would prevent him and similarly situated aces from developing the families which they desire. As a sexual orientation, asexuality shares an identity-based connection with gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, yet aces’ disinterest in sexual intimacy seems at odds with much of the LGBT movement’s collective identity. Additionally, many within the LGBT community do not recognize that aces’ romantic attraction and gender identity may be nonnormative. For that reason, there are identity-based dissonances that   420.

Another element precluding solidarity is strategic, in that discrimination against aces is not intuitive, with many in the community wondering how a sexual orientation marked by absence could be the target of discrimination. Ace legal interests, however, promote the rights of many who fall within LGBT, particularly those whose interests marriage equality left behind. That asexuality’s connection with LGBT has so many unifying and disjunctive elements may explain why it is the least integrated of the QIA categories. V.  EXPANDING THE NATIONAL LGBT AGENDA The preceding analysis on nonbinary, intersex, and asexual identities and rights, combined with social movement theory on identity and strategy, indicates that any national organization’s expansion to include nonbinary, intersex, or asexual rights would press the current movement to adopt new strategies and goals that affect LGBT as much as QIA. This Part first examines the implications of expansion for the groups, beginning with QIA and then turning to LGBT. Given the challenges of movement expansion, it then presents other options that advocates may want to consider. A.  LGBT Movement Expansion The LGBT movement has extended its contours in recent years, yet movement expansion is a contested and ongoing process that depends as much on organizational capacity as collective identity and strategy.428 National LGBT groups already struggle to represent fully the panoply of their constituents, making movement expansion to include additional identity groups a fraught endeavor.429 Organizations can only prioritize so much. What is necessary to consider is therefore the costs and benefits of such a change. 1.  Considerations for QIA Q, I, and A benefit in clear ways from being part of an expanded LGBT movement. As smaller communities, these identity categories would gain access to resources and increased visibility for their law reform goals that would allow them to attain their goals.430 An expanded movement provides less resourced members with access to financial,   428. See supra Part I.  429. For a discussion of how racial, ethnic, and class divisions have contoured the movement’s goals and strategies, see supra notes 30, 106–07 and accompanying text.  430.

As groups seeking inclusion in the LGBT movement, Q, I, and A are in similar positions as the transgender rights advocates of the 1990s who fought to join the gay and lesbian movement. One of the major reasons transgender rights advocates sought movement expansion was to increase the likelihood of attaining law reform, as gay and lesbian rights groups had more clout than the transgender community.432 Before gay and lesbian rights groups expanded to LGBT, transgender individuals tried to have gender identity protections inserted to the draft ENDA, but their lack of resources stymied their efforts.433 When transgender rights activists first attempted to lobby Congress members on their own, they were able to muster a limited number of participants—six in one year and twenty in another.434 When gay and lesbian rights organizations became LGBT, the groups’ paid lobbying staff took over, securing a new version of the bill that was transgender-inclusive.435 Justas the history of transgender inclusion offers QIA reasons to join LGBT, so too might it warn QIA away from the LGBT movement. National LGBT rights groups were transgender-inclusive in name only for many years, leading transgender-specific organizations to proliferate.436 Transgender rights groups criticized their LGBT counterparts for focusing on issues that were of “minimal concern for low-income transgender communities of color.”437 These transgender rights organizations focused their advocacy on bathroom access, gender designations on identity documentation, and prison housing regulations—issues that national LGBT rights organizations have incorporated into their agendas after years of collaboration.438 QIA rights advocates may expect a similar problem to arise. Sociologists have shown that social movements generally provide most of their attention and resources to issues that primarily affect their privileged group members, and the LGBT legal movement is no exception.439 National LGBT rights organizations have prioritized the   431.

As scholars have noted, LGBT rights advocates have depicted sexual minorities “as White, affluent, urban dwelling, educated, and successful,” a strategy that “displace[d] people of color, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals, those of lesser means, and those living in rural America from much of the discourse on sexual minority rights.”443 LGBT rights groups also based their arguments on comparisons between race and sexual orientation, a rhetoric that critics assail as essentializing both categories.444 Advocates are constrained in the arguments they can make, as the legal system rewards claims for incremental changes. Movement expansion therefore raises significant questions as to what strategic shifts national organizations would have to undertake, as well as whether those changes would imperil their advocacy efforts. National LGBT rights organizations may similarly adopt an assimilationist framework for nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights that members of these identity categories may resist.445 Just as national LGBT rights groups determine what issues to represent and how, nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights advocates need to determine whether that representation meets their ultimate needs.   440.

Considerations for LGBT The same challenges that should give Q, I, and A advocates pause are also the reasons that LGBT community members may want to press for movement expansion. Incorporating QIA could give rise to priorities and strategies that could reshape what it means to advocate for non-normative individuals. An agenda that includes Q, I, or A will likely result in national organizations prioritizing the needs of their neglected constituents, though perhaps with less success than they have recently enjoyed. Nonbinary rights tend to intersect with the interests of gender nonconforming gays and lesbians, as well as bisexuals—subgroups that national LGBT rights organizations tend to ignore. Advocacy for nonbinary rights requires moving away from an emphasis on the sexual binary, which has been important for securing gender conforming transgender rights. An example of how national groups could pursue this work is by focusing on issues like sex-differentiated grooming codes, which courts have upheld in cases involving “[g]arden-variety gender benders,” a shorthand Professor Kimberly Yuracko adopted for “those who object to some but not all of the conventions associated with their biological sex.”446 These policies reinforce gender norms in ways that harm both nonbinary individuals and gender nonconforming gays and lesbians, without impairing the interests of gender conforming transgender individuals. Intersex advocacy likewise promotes the interests of individuals who inhabit the space between the sexes and therefore the gender nonconforming part of LGBT. The physiological basis for intersex advocacy is especially beneficial for those who challenge the claimed naturalness of the sexual binary, although this may not staunch opposition arguments, especially since conservative Christian doctrine insists on a differentiation of the sexes.447 Here, national organizations could represent these interests through curricular reform efforts aimed at introducing a holistic view of sex and gender, which would benefit transgender, nonbinary, and intersex individuals.448 As for asexuality, its focus on functional family doctrines may expand the movement’s scope of work in ways that reach currently overlooked LGBT individuals. The move away from formal equality to equity would be a significant step for national LGBT groups to take, insofar as functional family doctrines would benefit many LGBT families. They   446.

This latter move would promote a more comprehensive view of sexual orientation that may benefit bisexuals by making them a visible part of debates, rather than an implicit partner. Of course, aces’ lack of sexual attraction may spur countermobilization that would impede advocacy. Asexuality threatens the mandate to “[b]e fruitful, and multiply,”449 even as conservative Christians consider sexual thoughts and desires sinful, and for that reason may generate new opposition.450 Although LGBT movement expansion could have important benefits, it has significant drawbacks as well. There are reasons why national organizations selected particular goals and pursued assimilationist strategies: they are the ones that are most likely to be successful. Attorneys must weigh many factors, including constituents’ desires, donors’ preferences, institutional capacity, and the likelihood of success given the political and legal landscape.451 Moreover, to the extent changing tacks provides fodder for opponents and generates increased backlash, and increased representation reduces flexibility and agility, national LGBT rights groups understandably may be unwilling or unable to change approaches.452 Importantly, the decisions regarding movement expansion are in the hands of both national LGBT rights groups and QIA rights advocates, as the LGBT movement’s history demonstrates. Before the LGBT movement formed, transgender rights advocates lobbied for their inclusion by protesting the work of noninclusive organizations.453 These advocates gained intramovement attention, with movement members then demanding that organizations revise their mission statements and agendas.454 Similarly, the marriage equality movement unfolded despite national organizations’ initial efforts to prevent courts from considering the issue.455 National organizations assumed the lawsuits would lose and worried the cases would generate backlash; for that reason, they initially urged same-sex couples to refrain from litigating the issue.456 Nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights advocates may likewise be able to compel national organizations to shift their priorities and arguments, either   449.

That community members have forced national organizations to shift their priorities is both a function of the democratizing nature of social movements and reflective of leadership within the LGBT movement. Just as social movement actors shift public discourse by critiquing contemporary politics, their perspectives may also reshape the contours of the movement institutions that represent them.457 At the same time, although national LGBT rights organizations and their lawyers spearhead the movement, they are accountable to their clients and constituents, making community demands an essential part of their calculus.458 Lawyers’ professional responsibilities thus depend on movement demands, even if national organizations’ agendas are an imperfect simulacrum of the desires of the LGBT community as a whole. B.  Alternatives to Expansion The incorporation of nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights could produce reformulated arguments and new priorities, as well as different conceptions of what non-normativity means. However, the outcome could also be fracture, dissolution, and disaggregation because of the costs that this change would impose. Movement expansion is a debate over who national LGBT rights groups should be representing and how they should do so, but there is no clear answer to these fundamental questions. Importantly, expansion is not the only option for national LGBT organizations or nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights advocates. There are other ways for LGBT and QIA to work together short of proceeding as an integrated movement, which advocates may prefer. Rights organizations may engage in coalition work or collaborate with one another in more limited ways, such as by sharing information, providing advice, offering specialized knowledge, and mobilizing memberships to attend one another’s events.459 These forms of cooperation are beneficial insofar as they allow the groups to avoid the problems of deprioritization and strategic tension that transgender rights advocates faced. The LGBT movement has a history of forming both inter- and intramovement coalitions. Over the past decade, regional LGBT rights groups have united with immigrant rights organizations in legislative and ballot measure campaigns, jointly addressing issues such as marriage   457.

Several themes permeate all of the groups’ work, from the opposition of discrimination to the advancement of antisubordination, bodily integrity, and sexual freedom. In fostering these doctrinal goals, coalition work may serve as a step on the path to movement integration. Thus, advocates could form an alliance of interest in any one of the areas of connections, like functional parenthood, identity documents, or sex-segregated facilities. Collaboration could additionally serve as the basis for later movement expansion, though it would not necessarily have that result. LGBT rights groups altered their priorities after working with transgender rights advocacy organizations, but the movement had by that point already committed to being LGBT.465 The collaboration did not spark a change in the movement, but rather led organizations to fulfill their prior commitments to transgender inclusivity.466 An alternative would be for the groups to engage in more circumscribed cooperation than coalition building. Here, the main benefit is that groups may differ in their priorities and strategies and therefore may assist one another without forgoing their own preferences. So long as the goals are not at cross-purposes, sporadic support carries relatively little risk for a social movement, particularly since that assistance may be withdrawn at any time.467 Accepting aid for specific ventures, rather than entering a formal alliance or integrating movements, also reduces the likelihood of one partner’s interests being subordinated to that of a more powerful ally.   460.

Small groups might not accomplish any of their goals without a coalition partner, as limited support may simply be insufficient. Advice and endorsements are relatively cheap, and organizations may not actualize their benefits. This limitation applies equally to coalition between underresourced partners, as organizations are likely to work with one another to gain access to personnel, expertise, networks, and funds.468 As a result, neither coalition work nor more limited support may serve the needs of nonbinary, intersex, or asexual rights advocates, especially since assistance may be withdrawn at any time.469 Cooperation and coalition work are not simply alternatives to one another, as organizations that enter alliances on one issue may only provide limited support on another. Thus, LGBT and asexual advocates might form a coalition to press for functional family recognition, while LGBT rights groups could provide more limited support for aces’ efforts to eliminate impotency from annulment statutes, given that this subject is not particularly salient to LGBT individuals. Similarly, although LGBT rights groups have formed coalitions with intersex advocates to address gender designations on identity documents, they may decide to only provide sporadic support for intersex rights groups’ efforts to restrict gender surgery on intersex infants. At the other end of the spectrum, the LGBT movement could reformulate itself entirely.470 Social movements often fracture, particularly as coalitions become unsustainable over time.471 Both conservative or more racial members may prefer to work outside of mainstream rights organizations to advocate for more controversial positions. For example, in 1992, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Reproductive Rights Project left to form the comparatively more liberal Center for Reproductive Rights, which quickly became the leading pro-choice litigation group.472 What this indicates is that separation is neither anomalous nor necessarily harmful for the interests that the groups represent. Rather than combining LGBT and QIA, the groups could reorganize themselves based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Thus, the movements would become LGBA and TQI. Such a reconceptualization would turn on the identity-based connections between the categories,   468. See Jones et al., supra note 430, at 212.   469. See Meyer & Corrigall-Brown, supra note 65, at 329–30.   470. The movement could additionally expand beyond LGBTQIA, encompassing all gender and sexual minorities, but such a possibility is beyond the scope of this Article.   471. See supra Section I.A.  472.

The two would undoubtedly work with one another where their interests overlap, but the division might create stronger bonds within the movements by clarifying the basis for their union. The problem with such a change is that it promotes the interests of individuals who fit within one of the categories, thereby implicitly ignoring intersectional identities. The categories are all capacious and have boundaries that are often porous. Since individuals are multifaceted, they may identify across many of the categories. Additionally, circumstances may make interests more important to individuals than identity. A masculine-appearing lesbian who is required to meet feminine grooming standards at work may have a great deal in common with a transgender or nonbinary individual who cannot wear clothing appropriate to their gender identity at school.473 A gender conforming gay man’s experiences in prison may be similar to those of an incarcerated transgender woman.474 A butch lesbian who is asked to leave a restroom because she is mistaken for a man shares more, in that moment, with a transgender or nonbinary person than a femme lesbian.475 An ace who is asked about his lack of sexual partners may feel the same frustrations as an intersex individual who is asked about her biological sex. Given that the categories can be expansive, with experiences of gender and sexual nonconformity that bind everyone within the LGBT and QIA categories, disaggregation may not be the most useful shift. Given the long struggles to create a LGBT movement in the first place, it seems unlikely that national organizations will reorganize based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The more probable option would be for national LGBT rights groups to expand to include nonbinary, intersex, and asexual rights, or to engage in other forms of more limited cooperation. The alternatives to movement expansion that this Article has presented would promote many of the goals of nonbinary, intersex, and asexual individuals, although doing so would not address the more fundamental issue of the LGBT movement’s limited representation of its more marginal members. Whether and how the LGBT movement expands, or takes another form entirely, will require organizations to weigh how reframed goals and tactics will affect their ability to serve their constituents.   473.

National LGBT rights groups’ strategies have tended to marginalize nonbinary interests, while overwhelmingly ignoring intersex and asexual rights. The question of whether and how LGBT and QIA should work together is as much a problem of how nonbinary, intersex, and asexuality relate to LGBT as it is what interests national LGBT rights organizations should prioritize. The additional identity categories support the movement’s underlying principles in important ways: nonbinary reinforces the acceptability of gender nonconformity, intersex challenges a dimorphic view of sex, and asexuality expands perspectives on nonnormative sexual orientations and relationships. That these additional groups’ interests and priorities are aligned with the more marginalized members of the LGBT movement means that organizations would have to shift their goals and strategies. However, national rights groups have prioritized those issues that have the greatest likelihood of success and pursued them in ways that maximize their chance at victory. National organizations are balancing their need to represent group members and the legal reality in which they operate. A national LGBTQIA legal movement is therefore possible, but not inevitable, as it requires organizations to balance the scales between efficiency and inclusivity, as well as capacity and ideology. These decisions as to whom national organizations represent ultimately strike at the movement’s most fundamental debates over what the LGBT movement is and what it should be. 77George: Expanding LGBTPublished by UF Law Scholarship Repository, 2021",
