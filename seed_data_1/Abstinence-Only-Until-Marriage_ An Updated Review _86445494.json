Although abstinence is theoretically effective, in actual practice,intentions to abstain from sexual activity often fail. Given a rising age at ﬁrst marriage around theworld, a rapidly declining percentage of young people remain abstinent until marriage. Promotionof AOUM policies by the U.S. government has undermined sexuality education in the United Statesand in U.S. foreign aid programs; funding for AOUM continues in the United States. The weight ofscientiﬁc evidence ﬁnds that AOUM programs are not effective in delaying initiation of sexualintercourse or changing other sexual risk behaviors. AOUM programs, as deﬁned by U.S. federalfunding requirements, inherently withhold information about human sexuality and may providemedically inaccurate and stigmatizing information. Thus, AOUM programs threaten fundamentalhuman rights to health, information, and life. Young people need access to accurate andcomprehensive sexual health information to protect their health and lives.\u0001 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280274This review article updates our 2006 review of abstinence-only-until-marriage (AOUM) policies and programs promotedTable 1Federal deﬁnition of “abstinence education” [1]Under Title V, Section 510 of the 1996 Social Security Act, P.L. 104e193, theterm “abstinence education” is deﬁned as an educational or motivationalprogram which [1](A) has as its exclusive purpose, teaching the social, psychological, andhealth gains to be realized by abstaining from sexual activity(B) teaches abstinence from sexual activity outside marriage as the ex-pected standard for all school-aged children(C) teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way toavoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, andother associated health problems(D) teaches that a mutually faithful monogamous relationship in thecontext of marriage is the expected standard of human sexual activity(E) teaches that sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likelyto have harmful psychological and physical effects(F) teaches that bearing children out-of-wedlock is likely to have harmfulconsequences for the child, the child’s parents, and society(G) teaches young people how to reject sexual advances and how alcoholand drug use increases vulnerability to sexual advances(H) teaches the importance of attaining self-sufﬁciency before engaging insexual activityby the U.S. government. We use the term AOUM to describeprograms and policies that adhere to U.S. federal governmentfunding requirements created in 1996. This update addresses themajor changes in AOUM funding and programs, the accumula-tion of evaluation and observational research, and a betterunderstanding of the impact of AOUM programs on other publichealth programs and speciﬁc groups of adolescents.MethodologyResearch on AOUM was identiﬁed in multiple ways. Wecollected reports from researchers, educators, and policymakersinvolved in sexuality education and adolescent health, and weincluded policy-relevant information and viewpoints aboutAOUM programs from sources such as government reports orreports from advocacy organizations. A literature reviewfocusing on the period since 2006 was also undertaken usingGoogle Scholar, although this identiﬁed few additional resources.Information on human rights was taken from internationaldeclarations and from reports provided by human rights orga-nizations. Publications from advocacy organizations wereincluded when they were inﬂuential in policy debates.Deﬁnitions of Abstinence and Abstinence-Only-Until-MarriageAbstinence, as the term is used by program planners andpolicymakers, is often not clearly deﬁned. A variety of terms havebeen used to describe programs that focus exclusively on pro-moting abstinence, including “abstinence-only,” “AOUM,” and“sexual risk avoidance;” the latter term is increasingly used byproponents. Health professionals generally view abstinence as abehavioral or health issue, using terms such as “postponing sex,”“never had vaginal sex,” or refraining from further sexual inter-course if sexually experienced. In contrast, AOUM proponentsgenerally deﬁne abstinence in moral terms, using language suchas “chaste” or “virgin” and framing abstinence as a “commitmentto chastity.” This terminology reﬂects the religious origins ofAOUM programs. U.S. federal funding policy adopted such amoralistic deﬁnition of “abstinence education” in 1996, forexample, requiring it “teaches that a mutually faithful monoga-mous relationship in the context of marriage is the expectedstandard of human sexual activity” [1]. See Table 1 for the federaldeﬁnition of “abstinence education.”Thus, it is important to recognize that many advocates ofAOUM programs are primarily concerned with issues such ascharacter and morality, while health professionals are generallyconcerned with health behaviors and health outcomes. Thishelps to explain the disconnect between the two groups.The History of AOUM Funding Programs in the United StatesThe federal government began supporting abstinence pro-motion programs in 1981 via the Adolescent Family Life Act,which provided funding to community- and faith-based orga-nizations and was established to promote “chastity” and “self-discipline.” Beginning in 1996, there was a major expansion infederal support to states for AOUM programming through theTitle V AOUM program (as part of “welfare reform”) and a shift tofunding programs that promoted only abstinence and restrictedother information [2e5]. The Community-Based Abstinence Ed-ucation (CBAE) programwas created in 2000, which made grantsdirectly to community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations. Federal funding for these programs grewrapidly from ﬁscal year (FY) 1996 until FY 2006. The fundingleveled out between FYs 2006 and 2009 and then was signiﬁ-cantly reduced in FY 2010. Funding increased in FY 2012, andagain in FY 2016. Between FYs 1982 and 2017, Congress has spentover $2 billion on domestic AOUM programs [6]. Funding forAOUM continues today at both the federal and state levels.With passage of welfare reform in 1996 came the creation ofthe Title V AOUMprogram and eight-point AeH federal statutorydeﬁnition of “abstinence education,”which speciﬁes, in part, thatprograms must have as their “exclusive purpose” the promotionof abstinence outside of marriage (see Table 1 for the completedeﬁnition). Programs funded through this funding stream to thestates did not have to address all the eight points of the AeHdeﬁnition; however, they could “not be inconsistent with anyaspect of the abstinence education deﬁnition [7]” and, therefore,could not in any way advocate contraceptive use or discusscontraceptive methods except to emphasize their failure rates[3,4]. Congressional intent for the CBAE program was to create“pure” AOUM programs, in response to concerns that states wereusing Title V AOUM funds for “soft” activities, such as mediacampaigns, instead of direct classroom instruction and weretargeting younger adolescents [3]. CBAE-funded programs wererequired to teach all the eight points of the federal deﬁnition of“abstinence education,” had to target 12- to 18-year-olds, anddexcept in limited circumstancesdcould not provide young peo-ple with information about contraception or safer-sex practices,even with their own nonfederal funds [3]. The guidelines alsobroadened the deﬁnition of abstinence from avoiding sexualintercourse to abstaining from all “sexual activity,” which “refersto any type of genital contact or sexual stimulation between twopersons, including, but not limited to sexual intercourse [8e10].”In 2004, the House Committee on Government Reformreleased a report that 11 of the 13 AOUM programs most widelyused by CBAE grantees contained false, misleading, or distortedinformation about reproductive health, misrepresentationsabout the effectiveness of condoms in preventing sexuallyJ.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280 275transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy, as well as genderand sexual minority stereotypes, moral judgments, religiousconcepts, and factual errors [11]. A report released in November2006 by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Ofﬁcefound the Administration for Children and Families, whichoversaw the majority of federal AOUM funding, was providingvery little oversight of funded AOUM programs and noted thatthe federal agency did not review its grantees’ materials forscientiﬁc accuracy or even require grantees to review their ownmaterials for scientiﬁc accuracy [12].Given concerns about program efﬁcacy and increasinglyrestrictive federal program requirements, an increasing number ofstates refused Title V AOUM funding beginning in 2004. (Californiawas the only state that never accepted AOUM funding.) By 2009,nearly half of the states had chosen not to take federal support[13,14]. In March 2010, Title V AOUM funding was resurrected aspart of negotiations for passage of the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act, and $50 million a year was allocated for 5years ($250 million in total over 2010e2014). In April 2015,funding for the Title V AOUM program was extended through FY2017 and increased to $75 million per year in exchange for federalfunding for more comprehensive approaches to sex education, thePersonal Responsibility Education Program, which is also fundedthrough FY 2017 at a level of $75 million per year. Under currentguidance, the program is more ﬂexible; however, programs muststill teach abstinence to the exclusion of other topics. Programsmust ensure abstinence from sexual activity is an expectedoutcome andno funds can beused inways that contradict theAeHfederal AOUM deﬁnition. Funded programs may provide mentor-ing, counseling, and adult supervision and must be medically ac-curate and age appropriate. States cannot use the funds to educateadolescents about contraceptive use or discuss contraceptivemethods, except to emphasize failure rates. In FY 2015, 36 statesand six territories applied for Title V AOUM funding [15].In December 2010, Congress passed the ConsolidatedAppropriations Act of 2010, which eliminated all existingdiscretionary funding for AOUM programs, including the portionof Adolescent Family Life Act that had been tied to the eight-point deﬁnition of AOUM programs beginning in FY 1997 [16].This legislation also included the creation of the Teen PregnancyPrevention Program, which was funded at $101 million in FY2016. In FY 2016, Congress created the “Sexual Risk AvoidanceEducation” program, which is administered by Family and YouthServices Bureau in the Administration for Children and Families.Funded at $10 million in FY 2016, this program is deﬁned as“voluntarily refraining from nonmarital sexual activity” andteaching the “beneﬁts associated with self-regulation” and“success sequencing for poverty prevention,” which is outlinedas “completing school, securing a job, and marrying beforebearing children [17].” In FY 2016, a total of $85 million wasallocated for AOUM programs through the Title V AOUM pro-gram and the “Sexual Risk Avoidance Education” program and atotal of $176 million was allocated to more comprehensivesexuality education through the Teen Pregnancy PreventionProgram and Personal Responsibility Education Program.Trends in initiation of Sexual Intercourse and MarriageThe goal of AOUM programs is to delay initiation of sexualintercourse until marriage; however, this goal runs counter todemographic trends in the United States and around the globe.The clearest trend is a rising age at ﬁrst marriage; trends in age atﬁrst sex show less change and no universal pattern [18]. Thus, therising age at marriage has led to a substantial increase in pre-marital sex [19].In the United States, median age at ﬁrst sex among women fellfrom the 1960s (at age 19 years) until the early 1990s (at age17 years); age at ﬁrst sex then rose to 17.8 years in 2005 and hassince plateaued [20]. However, given secular trends towards risingage atmarriage over the past 60 years, the interval of timebetweenﬁrst intercourse andﬁrstmarriage has increased over time for bothwomenandmen in theUnited States.While themedian age atﬁrstintercourse for women is currently 17.8 years, the median age atﬁrst marriage is 26.5 years (a gap of 8.7 years); for men, the gapbetween the median age at ﬁrst sex (18.1 years) and ﬁrst marriage(29.8 years) is 11.7 years [20]. Only a small percentage of youngpeople wait until marriage to have their ﬁrst intercourse. Incontrast, among women born in the 1940s (and turning age 15years between 1955 and 1964), the interval between ﬁrst inter-course and ﬁrst marriage was between 1 and 1.5 years.Psychological and Physical Health Related to AdolescentSexual InitiationThe goal of sex education is to raise sexually healthy adults.Healthy development requires complete information, open andhonest conversations, and support for decision-making about sexand relationships [21e23]. This vision of sexuality education isdirectly contradicted by AOUM thinking (see Table 1) [3,5].Advocates for AOUM programs and the language of the U.S.government policy suggest that sexual activity outside of thecontext of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological andphysical effects. We ﬁnd little evidence suggesting that consen-sual sex between adolescents is psychologically harmful. Rather,psychological harmdwhen it occursdappears to be the result ofsexual coercion and nonconsensual experiences, includingadverse childhood experiences [24] and sexual abuse [25].Recent large studies of representative adolescent populationssuggest early sexual intercourse is not associatedwith physical oremotional symptoms, except to the extent that cultural normsand social sanctions create disparities for girls compared to boyswith respect to early sexual behavior [26]. Rigid cultural normsand social sanctions likely account for this gender disparity;these gender stereotypes undermine adolescents’ sexual health.Initiation of sexual intercourse in adolescence is associatedwith an increased risk of STIs, including HIV, and mistimed andunwanted pregnancy. Adolescents have the highest age-speciﬁcrisk for many STIs [27], and the highest age-speciﬁc proportionof unintended pregnancy [28]. Long-term sequelae of STIs caninclude infertility, tubal pregnancy, fetal and infant demise,chronic pelvic pain, cervical cancer [29], and death from HIV. Toreduce the risk of these adverse outcomes, adolescents canengage in a variety of risk reduction and risk avoidance (i.e.,abstinence) behaviors.The risk associated with adolescent sexual activity is greatlyinﬂuenced by policy context. As is the case with the mentalhealth outcomes of sexual activity, physical outcomes are asmuch the result of environmental factors as of individual choices.In countries in which adolescents receive routine access to con-traceptive education and counseling, and necessary socioeco-nomic resources, their pregnancy and birth rates tend to be afraction of those of their peers in the United States [30,31]. Weexplore the efﬁcacy of risk reduction and risk avoidance next.J.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280276Evaluations of AOUM and Comprehensive SexualityEducation Programs in Promoting AbstinenceWhile advocates of AOUM policies and programs haveasserted their effectiveness, scientiﬁc evidence suggests other-wise. A 2007 systematic review by Douglas Kirby [32] found noscientiﬁc evidence that AOUM programs demonstrate efﬁcacy indelaying initiation of sexual intercourse, reducing the number ofsexual partners, or facilitating secondary abstinence. Moreover, arigorous national evaluation was completed in 2007 by Mathe-matica Policy Research, Inc., with support from the Departmentof Health and Human Services Ofﬁce of the Assistant Secretaryfor Planning and Evaluation [33]; among four-model AOUMprograms, no impact was found on initiation of sexual inter-course, numbers of sexual partners, or other behaviors.A 2007 Cochrane meta-analysis of 13 AOUM programs foundthat evaluated programs consistently showed no impact onsexual initiation, frequency of vaginal sex, number of partners,condom use, or the incidence of unprotected vaginal sex [34].More recently, a 2012 meta-analysis by the U.S. Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention examined 66 comprehensive riskreduction (CRR) sexual health programs and 23 abstinence pro-grams. CRR programs had favorable effects on current sexualactivity (i.e., abstinence), number of sex partners, frequency ofsexual activity, use of protection (condoms and/or hormonalcontraception), frequency of unprotected sexual activity, STIs andpregnancy [35]. In contrast, the meta-analysis of risk avoidance(AOUM) programs found effects on sexual activity, but not onother behaviors. (Equivocal changes were found for a decrease infrequency of sexual activity and an increase in pregnancy.)Importantly, the effect on sexual activity was only signiﬁcant inthe nonrandomized control trial subgroup and not signiﬁcant inthe stronger randomized control trial subgroup. Thus, the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that while CRRprograms were an effective strategy for reducing adolescentpregnancy and STI/HIV among adolescents, “no conclusionscould be drawn on the effectiveness of group-based abstinenceeducation.” [35]. More recently, a 2016 review of 37 systematicreviews, summarizing 224 randomized controlled trials ofschool-based sex education programs concluded thatabstinence-only interventions did not promote positive changesin sexual initiation or other sexual behaviors [36].Efﬁcacy for Abstinence in Preventing Pregnancy and STIsAbstinence from sexual intercourse has been described as“the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexu-ally transmitted diseases (STDs), and other associated healthproblems” in the Section 510 Title V federal deﬁnition. This is amisleading and potentially harmful message that conﬂatestheoretical effectiveness of intentions to remain abstinent andthe actual practice of abstinence. Abstinence is often not effectivein preventing pregnancy or STIs as many young people whointend to practice abstinence fail to do so.The most useful observational data in understanding theefﬁcacy of abstinence intentions comes from examination of thevirginity pledge movement in the National Longitudinal Surveyof Youth (Add Health) [37,38]. Add Health data suggest that manyadolescents who intend to be abstinent fail to do so, and thatwhen abstainers do initiate intercourse, many fail to use con-doms and contraception to protect themselves [37,38]. Otherstudies ﬁnd higher rates of human papillomavirus andnonmarital pregnancies among adolescent females who took avirginity pledge than those who did not [39].Consequently, these studies suggest that user failure withabstinence is high. Thus, although theoretically completelyeffective in preventing pregnancy, in actual practice the efﬁcacyof AOUM interventions may approach zero.Public and Professional Support for Abstinence andComprehensive Sexuality EducationWhile the federal AOUMprogramassumes that abstinence andAOUM programs are universally valued, public opinion polls inthe United States suggest strong support for comprehensive ap-proaches to sex educationdincluding abstinence as a behavioralgoaldbut also including education about condoms, contraception,and access to condoms and contraception for sexually active ad-olescents. In a 2014 nationally representative survey, 74% of adultssupport federal money going to programs proven to delay sex,improve contraceptive use and/or prevent teen pregnancy [40].Likewise, health professionals have overwhelmingly supportedcomprehensive sexuality education. The major associations ofphysicians and public health workers have endorsed comprehen-sive approaches to sexuality education; many have speciﬁcallytaken positions against AOUM programs that limit sexual andreproductive health information for young people [21e23,41e43].National public health goals, established by the U.S. Department ofHealth and Human Services [44], call for increasing the share ofadolescents receiving formal instruction about birth controlmethods, prevention of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and abstinence.Impact of AOUM Policies on Comprehensive SexualityEducationThe rise of AOUM policies and funding has been associatedwith signiﬁcant changes in the content of formal sex education inthe U.S. Consecutive surveys on health educational practice in theUnited States provide evidence of an erosion of comprehensivesexuality education in schools. The percentage of schools requiringinstruction about human sexuality fell from 67% in 2000 to 48% in2014, while the share requiring instruction about HIV preventiondeclined from 64% to 41%. By 2014, 50% of middle schools andjunior high schools and 76% of high schools taught abstinence asthe best way to avoid pregnancy, HIV, and STDs [45]. Only 23% ofjunior high schools and 61% of high schools taught about methodsof birth control generally, while 10% of middle school and juniorhigh school teachers and 35% of high school teachers taughtspeciﬁcally about the correct use of condoms [45].Likewise, nationally representative data from the NationalSurvey of Family Growth tracks adolescents’ reports of receipt offormal sex education from 1995 to 2013. During this period, mostadolescents aged 15e19 years (80%e90%) report formal in-struction about “how to say no to sex.” In 1995, 81% of adolescentmales and 87% of adolescent females reported receiving formalinstruction about birth control methods; by 2011e2013, this hadfallen to 55% of males and 60% of females. The share of adoles-cents who received instruction on abstinence but no instructionabout birth control methods, increased from 8% to 28% of femalesand from 9% to 35% of males from 1995 to 2011e2013 [46,47].The lack of clear federal policy guidelines or resources foradolescent comprehensive sexuality education has resulted in awide array of sex education policies at the state and schooldistrict level, and marked disparities by state and district inJ.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280 277access to comprehensive sex education and sexual health out-comes [47,48]. For example, in Indiana, in a single school district,AOUM is taught in general health classes while comprehensivesex education is provided to pregnant and parenting teens. Statelaws vary considerably. When sex education is taught, 37 requireabstinence to be taught, 26 require abstinence to be stressed, and11 that abstinence only be covered [49]. Nineteen states requireteaching that sexual activity should only occur in marriage. Eightstates either require negative information on sexual orientationor do not allow information to be provided on sexual orientation[49,50]. Policymaking, occurring at the state and local levels,frequently is done without reference to data on effectiveness, theneed to support healthy sexual development, or the ethics ofwithholding potentially lifesaving sexual health information.Existing state-level data on the effects of state abstinence policiesat best shows no change in teen pregnancy and STIs [48,51e53],with several studies showing an association between increas-ingly strict abstinence policies and higher rates of pregnancy,teen births, and chlamydia infections [54e56].The Human Right to Sexual Health InformationThe U.S. federal approach to abstinence promotion raisesserious ethical and human rights concerns. Access to complete andaccurate STI, HIV/AIDS, and reproductive and sexual health infor-mation has been recognized as a basic human right and essentialto realizing the human right to the highest attainable standard ofhealth [57]. Governments have an obligation to provide accurateinformation to their citizens and eschew the provision of misin-formation; such obligations extend to government-funded healtheducation and health care services [57].International treaties provide that all people have the right to“seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds,”including information about their health [58e60]. The U.N. Com-mittee on the Rights of the Childdthe U.N. body responsible formonitoring implementation of theConventionon theRights of theChild, and which provides authoritative guidance on itsprovisionsdhas emphasized that children’s right to accessadequate HIV/AIDS and sexual health information is essential tosecuring their rights tohealth and information [61,62]. Article12ofthe InternationalCovenantonEconomic, Social andCulturalRightsspeciﬁcally obliges governments to take all necessary steps for the“prevention, treatment, and control of epidemic. diseases,” suchas HIV/AIDS [63]. The Committee on Economic, Social and CulturalRights, the U.N. body responsible for monitoring implementationof the International Covenant on Economic, Social and CulturalRights, and which provides authoritative guidance on its pro-visions,has interpretedArticle12 to require the “theestablishmentof prevention and education programs for behavior-related healthconcerns such as STDs, inparticular HIV/AIDS, and those adverselyaffecting sexual and reproductive health” [60].The United Nations Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and HumanRights provide guidance in interpreting international legalnorms as they relate to HIV and AIDS. These guidelines similarlycall on states to“ensure that children and adolescents have adequate accessto conﬁdential sexual and reproductive health services,including HIV/AIDS information, counseling, testing andprevention measures such as condoms,” [64].Access to accurate health information is a basic human rightthat has also been described in international statements onreproductive rights such as the Programme of Action of the In-ternational Conference on Population and DevelopmentdCairo,1994 [65]. Overall, these international treaties and statementsclearly deﬁne the important responsibility of governments toprovide accurate and complete information on sexual health totheir adolescent citizens [66].Ethical Obligations of Health Care Providers and Teachers/Health EducatorsThe U.S. AOUM program is also at odds with commonlyaccepted notions of medical ethics. Just as adolescents have theright to accurate and complete information from teachers andhealth educators, health care providers have ethical obligationsto provide accurate health information in caring for patients [67].Health care providers may not withhold information from apatient to inﬂuence health care choices. Informed consent re-quires provision of all pertinent information to the patient.Similar ethical obligations apply to health educators [68e70].The withholding of information on contraception or barrierprotection to induce the adolescent to become abstinent isinherently coercive. It violates the principle of beneﬁcence (i.e.,do good and avoid harm) as it may cause an adolescent to useineffective (or no) protection against pregnancy and STIs. Simi-larly, government programs providing abstinence as a soleoption are ethically problematic, as they exclude accurate infor-mation about contraception and misinform by overemphasizingor mis-stating the risks of contraception [11,71].AOUM Programs and Gender StereotypesAOUM programming has often included different lessons forand about girls and boys and reinforces gender stereotypes aboutfemale passivity and male aggressiveness [72]. The 2004Waxman report found that AOUM programs included genderstereotypes [11]. Rigid masculinity and femininity beliefs andgender inequities are often associated with negative sexualhealth behaviors including reduced likelihood of condom andcontraceptive use [73,74]. The programs that critique rigidgender norms and gender-based power imbalances are morelikely to positively impact sexual and reproductive healthknowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and health outcomes.AOUM Programs and Sexually Active YouthAOUM programs geared to adolescents who have not yetengaged in coitus and programs simply promoting abstinencesystematically ignore the immediate needs of sexually activeadolescents, a group with speciﬁc reproductive health needs andwho often require more than abstinence education [75]. Sexuallyactive youth are put at immediate risk when this information iswithheld or distorted. Data from the 2006e2010 Survey ofFamily Growth indicate that many sexually experienced adoles-cents (25% females and 37% males) have not received formalinstruction about birth control methods [47].AOUMprograms often portray abstinence from sexual activityas a conscious choice over which a young person has total con-trol. In reality, some young people do not have the choice toremain abstinent due to intimate partner violence, sexual abuse,rape, and/or molestation [76,77]. In addition, AOUM programsdismiss sexually active youth by suggesting that they are lessworthy than their abstinent peers and should feel ashamed ofJ.S. Santelli et al. / Journal of Adolescent Health 61 (2017) 273e280278their sexual behavior. Federal guidelines for AOUM programsassociate all premarital sexual activity and nonmarital preg-nancy, and parenthoodwith negative health outcomes, includinglater sexual dysfunction and or guilt about sex [78].AOUM Programs and Sexual Minority YouthAOUM programs may have profoundly negative impacts onthe well-being of sexual minority youth including lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. In 2015national data from U.S. high school students, 88.8% of studentsidentiﬁed as heterosexual, 2.0% identiﬁed as gay or lesbian, 6.0%identiﬁed as bisexual, and 3.2% were not sure of their sexualidentity. Same sex partners were reported by 6.3% of students;adolescents with same sex partners do not necessarily identify aslesbian, gay, or bisexual.AOUM programs are unlikely to meet the health needs ofsexual minority youth, as these programs are largely hetero-normative and often stigmatize homosexuality as deviant andunnatural behavior [11,79e81]. Stigma and discrimination cancontribute to health problems such as suicide, feelings of isola-tion and loneliness, HIV infection, substance abuse, and violenceamong sexual minority youth [82e85]. By excluding sexual mi-norities, AOUM programs may produce feelings of rejection andbeing disconnected to school [86].The U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage acrossthe country in 2015. Before this change, for many LGBTQ youththe AOUM message implied that they should never engage insexual activity as marriage was not a legal option for them [80].However, the heterosexist bias of most AOUM curricula meansthat many LGBTQ youth will not get the critical health messagesthey need from these programs.Global Impact of U.S. AOUM FundingAOUM policies by the U.S. government have also inﬂuencedglobal HIV prevention efforts [87], primarily through re-quirements of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief(PEPFAR). Launched in 2003, PEPFAR originally focused on 15countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia that hadbeen severely affected by AIDS. At that time, PEPFAR requiredgrantees to devote at least 33% of prevention spending (andtwo thirds of funds for sexual transmission) to abstinence-until-marriage programs [88e90]. After 2006, HIV preventionprograms funded under PEPFAR were required to follow speciﬁcguidance on Abstinence, Be faithful, and Condom use issued bythe Ofﬁce of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator [91]. The guidancenecessitated that, “implementing partners must.not give aconﬂicting message with regard to abstinence by confusingabstinence messages with condom marketing campaigns thatappear to encourage sexual activity or appear to present absti-nence and condom use as equally viable, alternative choices[91].” In response to the Abstinence, Be faithful, and Condom useguidance, the U.S. Government Accountability Ofﬁce noted thatseparate programming for abstinence within PEPFAR oftenundermined country-level national efforts to create integratedmessages and programs for HIV prevention [12]. Human rightsgroups also found that U.S. government policy was a source formisinformation and censorship in PEPFAR countries [92]. TheU.S. emphasis on AOUM may also have reduced condom avail-ability and access to accurate information on HIV/AIDS in somecountries [92,93].Notably, a large, well-conducted randomized controlled trialin Kenya found that the national HIV/AIDS school curriculumdfocusing on AOUM without mention of condoms, contraception,or health service provisionddid not reduce pregnancy or STIsand had the unintended consequence of encouraging earlymarriage [94]. Further, a 2016 analysis of nationally representa-tive survey data from 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa for theperiod 1998e2013 found no difference in trends in adolescentsexual behaviors such as age at ﬁrst sex between PEPFAR andnon-PEPFAR nationsdsuggesting PEPFAR AOUM funding hadhad no impact on sexual behaviors [95].The emphasis within PEPFAR prevention shifted to science-based programming after 2008 with the dropping of earmarksfor AOUM [87]. A 2016 HIV prevention initiative for adolescentgirls and young women funded by PEPFAR and private founda-tions (DREAMS) speciﬁcally excludes abstinence-only pro-grammingdgiven that there is little to no evidence of efﬁcacy.SummaryPolicies or programs offering abstinence as a single option forunmarried adolescents are scientiﬁcally and ethically ﬂawed.AOUM programs have little demonstrated efﬁcacy in helpingadolescents to delay intercourse, while prompting health-endangering gender stereotypes and marginalizing sexualminority youth. While abstinence from sexual intercourse istheoretically fully protective against pregnancy and STIs, inactual practice, AOUM programs often fail to prevent these out-comes. AOUM programs have generated considerable politicalsupport from social conservatives, despite their lack of scientiﬁcevidence of efﬁcacy and the fact that they withhold criticalhealth information. The vast majority of Americans stronglysupport comprehensive approaches to sexuality education.Despite the fact that health care was founded on ethicalnotions of informed consent and free choice, federal AOUMprograms are inherently coercive, withholding informationneeded to make informed choices and promoting questionable,inaccurate, and stigmatizing opinions. Federal funding languagepromotes a speciﬁc moral viewpoint, not a public healthapproach. Federally funded AOUM programs censor lifesavinginformation about prevention of pregnancy, HIV, and other STIsand provide incomplete or misleading information aboutcontraception and leave sexual minority youth particularlyvulnerable. U.S. AOUM policies and programs are inconsistentwith commonly accepted notions of human rights.In many U.S. communities, there have been declines in theprovision of formal sex education (i.e., delivered by schools,churches, and other trusted social institutions) in the lastdecade, leaving young people without the critical health in-formation they need. Increased funding for AOUM or sexual riskavoidance approaches would further restrict young people’saccess to the education they need to stay safe and healthy. Inboth domestic and global contexts, AOUM has not resulted indelays in sexual intercourse or the adoption of more protectivesexual behaviors. The emphasis on AOUM approaches hasharmed other public health efforts, such as family planningprograms and HIV prevention efforts, domestically and globally.Governments in the United States and elsewhere should sup-port medically accurate, evidence-based, and scientiﬁcallyjustiﬁed approaches to sexuality education for young people.AOUM as a basis for health policy and programs should beabandoned.J.S.

    "abstract": "Adolescence is marked by the emergence of human sexuality, sexual identity, and the initiation of intimate relations; within this context, abstinence from sexual intercourse can be a healthy choice. However, programs that promote abstinence-only-until-marriage (AOUM) or sexual risk avoidance are scientifically and ethically problematic and as such have been widely rejected by medical and public health professionals. Although abstinence is theoretically effective, in actual practice, intentions to abstain from sexual activity often fail. Given a rising age at first marriage around the world, a rapidly declining percentage of young people remain abstinent until marriage. Promotion of AOUM policies by the U.S. government has undermined sexuality education in the United Statesand in U.S. foreign aid programs; funding for AOUM continues in the United States. The weight of scientific evidence finds that AOUM programs are not effective in delaying initiation of sexual intercourse or changing other sexual risk behaviors. AOUM programs, as defined by U.S. federal funding requirements, inherently withhold information about human sexuality and may provide medically inaccurate and stigmatizing information. Thus, AOUM programs threaten fundamental human rights to health, information, and life. Young people need access to accurate and comprehensive sexual health information to protect their health and lives",
