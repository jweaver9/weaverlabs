Hernández** & Kimani Paul-Emile*** INTRODUCTION It has been ten years since this journal last published a volume exploring Loving v. Virginia,1 the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1967 decision invalidating antimiscegenation laws on equal protection and due process grounds.2  In that time, the American public has been treated to a virtual smorgasbord of new opportunities to love Loving.  First, in a way few could have imagined fifty years ago when seventeen states criminalized interracial marriages,3 that decision has provided the impetus for a “global network” of celebrations designed to praise interracial relationships and families and to combat discrimination.4  Families and couples now gather annually in communities  *  Professor of Law and Faculty Director, Center on Race, Law and Justice, Fordham University School of Law. **  Archibald R.

This conference would not have been possible without the assistance of a network of people.  We are very grateful to Amanda Gottlieb, Julia MacAllister, Adam Minchew, Catherine Tremble, and others at the Fordham Law Review for their hard work in connection with this Symposium.  We also extend special thanks to Tomas Barron for excellent research assistance and to Carrie Johnson, Shanelle Holley, and Rob Yasharian for their hard work in publicizing and handling the many details involved in making an event of this sort successful.  Finally, we express our gratitude to Dean Matthew Diller for his support and, of course, extend thanks to the talented scholars who, by participating in the conversations facilitated by this conference, deepened our collective understanding of Loving v. Virginia and its meaning in the twenty-first century.   1. 388 U.S. 1 (1967).  2.

For those seeking information about how to join in the celebration, a Loving Day website—replete with party suggestions, background information about the case, and personal histories of interracial couples—now exists.6 Loving has also been the inspiration for not just one, but two critically acclaimed films.7  Albeit in different ways, these films explore the facts underlying the case and the determined couple—Mildred and Richard Loving—who set off a legal case that struck at the very heart of the Jim Crow system when they refused to endure twenty-five years of court-mandated exile from the community in which they grew up and fell in love as punishment for marrying across race lines.8  The 2012 HBO documentary, The Loving Story, shown as part of this Symposium’s opening session, and the 2016 feature film Loving have provided the public with important details about the intimate lives and challenges of the Lovings and their children previously not known outside their family, others directly involved in the case, or others exploring it in academic circles.9 Finally, Loving, and the right to marry it identified, was at the forefront of the national litigation strategy to secure the ability of gay and lesbian couples to enter into marital unions that concerned not only states but also the federal government.10  Advocates for equal marriage rights repeatedly invoked the Loving Court’s language recognizing marriage as “one of the ‘basic civil rights of man,’ fundamental to our very existence and survival,” in challenging legal provisions that limited marriage to individuals of the opposite sex.11  Unsurprisingly, Loving subsequently figured prominently in  https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/593b4961e4b094fa859f1878 [https://perma.cc/ W9ZR-B46T].  5.

Hodges,12 which finally settled legal debates about the right of LGBTQ couples to marry.13  The Court held that states may not deny same-sex couples the opportunity to formalize their intimate relationships through legal marriage without violating the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal treatment and dignity under the law.14 These developments have only further endeared Loving—already among the best known of any case in the constitutional law canon—to the general populace to an extent few other court decisions claim.15  Whether because of its brave and aptly named plaintiffs, because of the increase in interracial intimacy, however slow, that followed the case’s definitive invalidation of state antimiscegenation laws,16 or because of the expansion of constitutional rights it later served to facilitate, Loving is part of mainstream culture.  Curiously, however, its integration into popular thought has not promoted a uniform understanding of its meaning and overall significance.17  Indeed, if anything, the opposite is true.  In many ways, Loving has come to mean a wide variety of things to an ever-growing number of people.18  It functions as a kind of Rorschach test for race and family.19 The majority opinion in Obergefell underscores this point in striking terms, bending Loving’s meaning so far in recognizing LGBTQ marriage rights that the precedent becomes virtually unmoored from the thoroughly racialized  Analogy:  Perez v.

Rather than celebrating love, the Court’s opinion states that laws against interracial marriage are unconstitutional because they are ‘measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.’” (quoting Loving v.

DALMAGE, TRIPPING ON THE COLOR LINE:  BLACK-WHITE MULTIRACIAL FAMILIES IN A RACIALLY DIVIDED WORLD 106 (2000) (“When people encounter a racially ambiguous person, they conduct a flurry of analyses to determine how the individual should be categorized.  This is a racial Rorschach test, taken in a society that creates and accepts racial stereotypes.”). 2628 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 86 context from which it sprang.20  In his opinion for the Obergefell majority affirming an individual’s right to marry the person of one’s choice, Justice Kennedy thoroughly decontextualized Loving, going so far as to suggest that, at its core, it was ultimately not a case about race and interracial marriage at all.21  On this account, the oft-noted rejection of Virginia’s Racial Integrity Act and antimiscegenation provisions as “measures designed to maintain White Supremacy” were mere surplusage.22  In Kennedy’s estimation, race was a marginal consideration in Loving, one incidental to the case’s central concern:  the scope of the right to marry.23  For him, the question posed was not fundamentally different from that put in issue by regulations on marriage later reviewed by the Court.24  He saw the constitutional issues presented to the Warren Court by the Lovings’ convictions and forced exile for marrying across race lines as essentially indistinguishable from barriers to legal marriage that, for example, turned on poverty25 or incarceration.26 Ten years ago, amidst ongoing public debate about sexual orientation-based marriage regulations, the Fordham Law Review’s symposium marking Loving’s fortieth anniversary focused on “explor[ing] in depth the modern implications of . . . Loving—what it says about the state’s role in intimate relationships, as well as what it might explain about race, family, and the place of marriage in modern society.”27  Now, with the predominant constitutional questions animating Obergefell itself resolved, we turn to focus intently on the questions of race that Justice Kennedy tried to quiet in his opinion.28  While Chief Justice Earl Warren’s opinion certainly provides the Court’s first articulation of the importance of marriage in the constitutional canon,29 it clearly also addresses the “scar of race” and its enduring impact.30  So, putting race at the center of our inquiry, we ask:  What can Loving tell us about the ongoing salience of race in twenty-first century America?  What should we make of the growth, albeit modest, in interracial relationships since 1967?  How should we think about the multiracial children of interracial   20. See R.A.

It bears noting, however, that Obergefell’s affirmation of equal marriage rights for LGBT couples left open a number of important constitutional questions.  The Court will decide one of them—whether public accommodation laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violate First Amendment rights of expression and religion where same-sex marriage is concerned—in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v.

SNIDERMAN & THOMAS PIAZZA, THE SCAR OF RACE (1995). 2018] FOREWORD:  FIFTY YEARS OF LOVING 2629 marriages?  What is the purpose of Chief Justice Warren’s conclusion in his Loving opinion that the fact that Virginia’s antimiscegenation law “prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy”31?  What accounts for the failure of the term “White Supremacy” to surface meaningfully in other cases? We begin from the position that, even fifty years later, Loving provides ample foundation for an inquiry into the operation of race and racial inequality in the United States, which touches on the queries outlined above, as well as many others.  In our view, a symposium focused on Loving makes a significant contribution by deepening scholarly analysis of that decision and by explicating the kinds of issues and concerns that should be at the heart of research concerning racial equality today.  The searing image of violence erupting as avowed white nationalists and supremacists marched through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia, this past summer—little more than 100 miles from Central Point, the small town where Mildred and Richard grew up and later raised their own family,32 and only months after the fiftieth anniversary of the Loving decision itself—provides a strong rejoinder to those who would contend otherwise.33  The turmoil, hatred, and the senseless loss of life that marked that day only underscored how far our country remains from the postracial future imagined by so many following Barack Obama’s assumption of the American presidency and how great the need to think seriously and deeply about race continues to be.34  Sadly, the words of our current President in the wake of the day’s events also underscore this priority.35  President Donald Trump’s comments insisting that the blame for the “hatred, bigotry and violence” that unfolded that day fell on “many sides” was rightly rejected by commentators of both sides of the aisle as wrongheaded and solicitous of the very racist elements responsible for the tragedy.36 Our goal in organizing this Symposium was to explore how Loving has influenced U.S. society institutionally, demographically, and relationally.  Doing so obviously required a focus on the present, where the disruptive effects of the interracial “mixing” and racial inclusion Loving endorsed can be seen in the growth of marriages and dating across racial lines.

To comprehend Loving’s impact fully, we understood that both its past and its future must be matters of concern as well.  The former has relevance because, historically, race in the United States has been socially constructed through interlocking narratives including law, cultural practice, and institutions.  Understanding the edifice for that racial hierarchy and how it was constituted ensures not only deeper comprehension of Mildred and Richard Loving’s particular travails but also the structural racism and inequality still operating today, which affect areas such as employment discrimination, housing segregation, and school segregation—all of which contrain people’s ability to meet and form relationships.38 Finally, keeping an eye on the future created opportunities to deepen understanding of the current effects of systemic racism and to develop systems-based strategies for continuing the struggle for social justice at a time when U.S. demographics are shifting away from a white majority.39  It also enabled an exploration of interracial marriages beyond those who are themselves married.  More than one-third of all adults surveyed in 2009 reported having a family member whose spouse is of a different race or ethnicity—up from less than a quarter in 2005.40  Since Loving, the proportion of the U.S. population with multiple racial heritages has grown dramatically.41  Moreover, the children born in the aftermath of Loving also have disrupted the social construction of race itself, with more people self-identifying as biracial, multiracial, or mixed race.  Yet current research suggests that mixed-race persons continue to experience discrimination that targets them as nonwhites rather than as uniquely mixed race.42 The four roundtable discussions and two keynote addresses that constituted this Symposium were designed to advance the multicontextual   37.

While legal issues figured prominently, we fostered a truly interdisciplinary discourse about interracial relationships and racial mixture, which drew on the insights of scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds.  The first panel, “A Focus on Loving in Law and Film,” set the stage for this success by locating our academic engagement with Loving in a documentary film that toggles between “black and white footage of the Lovings produced by Hope Ryden and shot by Abbot Mills”;43 “artistic documentary images . . . shot by photographer Grey Villet”; and “voice-over [of the Lovings], their [lawyers], friends[,] and witnesses.”44  As Nancy Buirski—the director of the film whom we were very fortunate to be able to include as a panelist—once explained, the incredible images used to make this film, especially those captured in the “luminous verité footage,” function to create “not only a narrative sensibility but also a time capsule of life in the [sixties]” for the Lovings, as well as others.45 This engagement with the everyday lives of Mildred and Richard—something that cases themselves rarely provide—made for a rich discussion of topics ranging from documentary film to religion.  Two panelists, Regina Austin and Kevin Noble Maillard, presented essays that consider more deeply the utility of documentary film and law in constructing the narratives of plaintiffs and people of color.46  Solangel Maldonado and Leora Eisenstadt each used aspects of the documentary to focus on key issues raised by Loving.  For example, Maldonado, who is currently working on a book on interracial intimacy, trained her attention on the children of interracial unions.  Eisenstadt focused on issues of religion.  Using the Loving district court’s infamous statement—“Almighty God created the races . . . and he placed them on separate continents.  And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages”47—as a jumping-off point, Eisenstadt’s essay in this Symposium considers the extent to which “America’s progression toward equal treatment regardless of race, gender, and sexual orientation is inherently intertwined with religion.”48 The second day of the symposium began with two keynote addresses that anchored panelists and participants alike.  William Zabel, a partner at Schulte, Roth & Zabel LLP, kept the Loving plaintiffs forefront in the minds of those gathered by detailing his experiences as a young lawyer assigned to assist in drafting the briefs in the case.

It considered decriminalization and the impact of making interracial relationships lawful after Loving.51  In particular, Murray observed that instead of introducing broadscale change in the treatment of interracial couples and families, Loving merely led to punishment and the application of different regulatory tools in areas such as child custody, where white women intimately involved with black men frequently lost custody of their biological children.52  This observation, Murray argued, has serious implications for decriminalization and the regulation of family units more generally.53 The remaining conference panels created opportunities to explore specific dimensions of the Loving case.  For example, “Loving v. Virginia’s Battle Against ‘White Supremacy’ and Segregation Today” grappled with the meaning of the Court’s reference to white supremacy, an undertheorized concept whose impact on intimate relationships and family has yet to be fully understood.  Linda McClain and Robin Lenhardt together considered notions of bigotry, further discussed in McClain’s article,54 as well as the value of the Court’s reliance on white supremacy. Rose Cuison Villazor went on to explore ways of combatting lingering “barriers to the establishment of racially integrated neighborhoods and communities” for interracial couples and others.55  Among other things, she imagines providing incentives to real estate developers to employ innovative methods of integrating neighborhoods.56  Similarly, Leah Hill looked back at the antimiscegenation laws that were at the center of the Loving decision to reveal what they can teach us about the overrepresentation of black children in the child welfare system today.57  Russell Robinson and David Frost looked “to make manifest the tension between the public posture of LGBT-rights litigants and the practices of some LGBT people who discriminate   49.

Finally, Chinyere Osuji provided a comparative context by describing her research of the common discrimination that interracial couples confront in Brazil and the United States.59 Similarly, the third panel considered the “Children of Loving,” individuals whose very existence, as an historical matter, served implicitly to contest the presumed legitimacy of racial categories like those formerly utilized under Virginia law.  The members of this panel’s collective view was that, “[a]lthough there are certainly many wonderful things about intermarriage, to say that intermarriage is the solution to the problem of racism is not a whole lot more logical than saying that heterosexual marriage is the route out of sexism.”60  Accordingly, submissions by these individuals work to problematize some of the thinking about the status of multiracial individuals in the United States.   Jasmine Mitchell and Reginald Oh both addressed the role of racial oppression and bias in how interracial children have been situated,61 while Taunya Banks and Kevin Brown considered questions about how multiracial individuals are categorized and understood.  Brown offers a moving essay detailing his experience as the father of “two black-white biracial children.”62  Banks, for her part, argues that multiracial individuals should have the freedom to identify themselves as they see fit where race is concerned.  She contends, however, that the need to create special categories to capture their multiracial status would be problematic.63  To this extent, Banks’s position resonates with Professor Tanya Hernández’s observation that antidiscrimination law is not structured around specific racial categories.  In an upcoming book, Hernández provides an exhaustive review of multiracial discrimination cases in a variety of contexts, including the workplace, educational settings, housing, public accommodations, jury service, and the criminal justice system.  She argues that those cases demonstrate that multiracial claimants face standard discrimination that targets them as nonwhites rather than as uniquely mixed race.64   58. Russell K.

Virginia, Twenty-First Century Science, and the Ethics of Biologizing Race,” moderated by Jonathan Kahn, brought the Symposium to a close by providing an opportunity to disrupt and rethink popular perceptions of race, biology, and technology.  Osagie Obasogie considered the antieugenic rather than romantic premise of the Loving decision in order to reorient our understanding of the case.65  Terence Keel examined how Euro-American ideas about God, nature, and race contributed to the development of antimiscegenation laws in the early colonies and later the United States. Two other panelists discussed the ways in which notions of biologized race inform modern assisted reproductive techniques (ART), as well as the choices made by the people seeking to utilize them in becoming parents.  Aziza Ahmed addressed the need to “interrogate the regulation of race in the context of family”66 and to attend to the “diffuse regulatory environment”67 in which doctors and patients made choices about assisted reproduction.68  Kimani Paul-Emile, using a recent complaint from Cramblett v. Midwest Sperm Bank, LLC69 as a point of departure, troubled the common presumption in ART that race concordance between parents and their children is a neutral and natural biological imperative.70  She uses Cramblett—a case in which a white mother brings a wrongful birth suit because her doctor wrongly impregnates her with the sperm of a black man71—to examine the stigma and disabling condition that blackness still constitutes in the United States.72  This inquiry serves to bolster an argument that Paul-Emile makes about race and disability status in the Georgetown Law Journal.73 As a whole, this Symposium makes a significant contribution by deepening scholarly analysis of the Loving decision and explicating the kinds of issues and concerns that should be at the heart of research concerning racial equality today.  Fifty years after Loving’s breathtaking condemnation of racial hierarchy and inequality, this research is even more important than ever.   65. See generally Osagie K.

    "abstract": "This Foreword provides an overview of Fifty Years of Loving v. Virginia and the Continued Pursuit of Racial Equality, a symposium hosted by the Fordham Law Review and cosponsored by the Fordham Law School Center on Race, Law & Justice. Even fifty years later, Loving provides ample foundation for an inquiry into the operation of race and racial inequality in the United States, which touches on the queries outlined above, as well as many others. In our view, a symposium focused on Loving makes a significant contribution by deepening scholarly analysis of that decision and by explicating the kinds of issues and concerns that should be at the heart of research concerning racial equality today",
