A 30 per cent tuition grant, which roughly translates to $1,600 off any depen-dent student's tuition, whose par-ents make under $160,000, is to be set in motion this January 2012. But it is true. The Ontario Liberal party, led by premier Dalton McGuinty, who promised this post secondary tu-ition grant if elected, were in fact elected this past October and seem to be living up to their promises. ''I'm torn between being really excit-ed and not letting myself believe it yet;' said third-year student Alexan-dra Rollinson. \"I work part time so this would really help my financial situation:' Sean Madden, president of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Al-liance (OUSA) said, \"Surprisingly, still not that many people know about it. But people are excited when we explain it, absolutely. They get pretty pumped when we tell them:' And who wouldn't? It is doubt-ful that any student dealing with increased tuition prices would turn their noses down at a sizable reduc-tion to their tuition. The only limi-tations are in qualiJYing - but even those are not the typical require-ments expected by students. \"Well I'd say it's great if it's actu-ally going to happen;' said third-year Queen's student Thomas Bai-ley. \"Because it's not really greatto spend four years in university or college and then spending double that trying to pay it off. So in reality, any little bit helps:' \"The big job right now is to make sure that every-one is aware of the grant and does op- in:' -Sean Madden, OUSA president In fact, according to Madden, about 85 per cent of dependent students can qualifY for the grant. The Ontario government consid-ers an independent student to be anybody who has worked full time for two years, or has been out of high school for more than four -they don't qualiJY. \"To qualiJY, you have to be a de-pendent student, so you have to fit that criteria. Your household in-come has to be less than $160,000 and you have to be a full-time stu-dent - or have 6o per cent of a full course load;' said Madden. \"Any-where from three to five [courses J is full time. And that's for the purposes of OSAP and granting and stufflike that:' \"If you get OSAP;' he contin-ued, \"You can also apply for this grant. We like that it's unhinged from OSAP because there were some concerns about participa-tion rates and OSAP, and you don't National, page 7 Wednesday, November 23, 2011 CHRIS MANDER STAFF WRITER thecord.ca The Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks' men's basketball team are putting forth an impressive start to the sea-son, with their record now standing at4-0. On Friday evening, in front of a large crowd for their home opener, the Golden Hawks dismantled the Queen's Gaels with ease by a score of88-62. The Hawks never trailed Queen's at any point in the game, and were able to capitalize on several sloppy turnovers by the opposition. Head coach Peter Campbell was impressed with his team's perfor-mance for the most part. \"I thought at times we played re-ally well, and at other times we played like we were ahead by a lot and lost our focus;' said the coach. The leading scorer for the Hawks was Maxwell Allin who had 15 points to go along with six assists; good enough for tops in both cat-egories for the evening. Saturday afternoon was much of the same story, as the Royal Military College (RMC) Paladins came to the Laurier Athletic Complex and, de-spite their best efforts, fell short by a devastating score of 130-72. La uri-er's offensive output was the highest in school history, and second most in OUA regular season history.

Toronto occupiers were given eviction orders that came into effect at 12:01last Tuesday. Occupy movement nears its end As 'occupiers' across Canada are evicted, the global protest that started Sept. 17 appears to be concluding LINDSAY PURCHASE LEAD REPORTER Occupy protests, which began in Canada on Oct. 15 seem to be near-ing the end of their days. Protestors in Ottawa, Toronto and Edmonton, among other Canadian cities, have been given their eviction notices, and some have already been forced to leave. As of early Tuesday morning, tents were dismantled along with the Occupy Movements in Quebec City and Victoria. In Edmonton, protestors have been distinguishing.themselves from other movements by occupy-ing private property, rather than in public parks. The land is owned by Melcor Developments Inc. Thus far, the eviction notice, which allows protestors to remain only during the day, is not being heeded. Robert Moyles, the director of strategic communications for the City of Edmonton commented, \"I think those negotiations [be-tween protestors and police] are progressing, and we're optimistic that there'll be successful resolution that allows them to have had their voices heard, and then also to move on from the site:' Were the Edmonton protestors to move onto public land, they would face similar restrictions due to by-law regulations which prohibit over-night camping, erecting structures without permission and activity be-tween the time of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. \"We support their right to pro-test in a safe and healthy manner;· Moyles continued. \"At the same time, we recognize the rights of the private property owner to manage the event on their property in the way that they see fit:' Still going strong is Occupy St. John's, where city officials appear to have a cordial relationship with protestors. For approximately one month, they have occupied Har-bourside Park in the downtown area without interference, something with mayor Dennis O'Keefe says is not likely to change. \"They have a right to be heard;' More news at thecord.ca LIZZY COOK FILE GRAPHIC Caffeine crash Brantford opens new coffee shop despite Williams deficit -Marcie Foster and Kyle Brown A voice for students CASA travels to Ottawa to lobby on Parliament Hill -Justin Fauteux Green lessons Learning from Germany, the world's 'Green' leaders -Lindsay Purchase \"It would have been great to ... somehow engage these people in a more meaningful way :• -Carolyn Bennett, MP for St. Paul's O'Keefe stated. \"And so long as they are not a danger to themselves, not a danger to anybody else ... then we will not be interfering:' O'Keefe firmly disagrees with ac-tion that has been taken at other protest sites to forcibly remove peo-ple from public spaces. \"Putting people in prisons is not an answer to the problems that exist NICK LACHANCE PHOTO MANAGER Loving what you do ACCESS U hosts post-grad emptoyment workshop -Justin Fauteux in society anymore than trying to violently evict people from a public protest. All that does is engender more protest;' he explained. The onus is on government, he believes, to work towards the so-cial change which has been the \"common denominator\" of all the movements. O'Keefe continued, \"If protests are done properly, then they can be a vehicle for social change. And to turn around and stymie them in a forcible way only creates and moti-vates more social unrest:' Carolyn Bennett, the member of parliament for central Toronto rid-ing St. Paul's, considers the disman-tling of protests, specifically Occupy Toronto, \"A bit of a lost opportu-nity:' Bennett commented, \"It would have been greatto ... somehow en-gage these people in a more mean-ingful way, in a long-term way so they don't actually have to be there:' According to Bennett, the lack of negotiation that has resulted in eviction notices being given to pro-testors is problematic. Protestors, she said, are well aware that politicians have already made their decisions, diminish-ing the effectiveness of citizen engagement. Bennett added, \"You're supposed to be able to influence a government or politician before they've made up their mind, not just some sort of ... cosmetic consultation:' The Toronto decision was to evict protestors was largely based on the fact that the right to protest was in-fringing on the rights of those who use the park for other purposes. Although many protestors cur-rently remain in the park, the City has made its position clear, and it remains to be seen how resistance to the eviction will play out with lo-cal authorities. Commenting on next steps to be taken, Bennett concluded, \"I think it should be to have a conversation with them about what could we do instead; to carry on a conversation that was meaningful and where they would feel that their voices are be-ingheard:' 4 • CAMPUS Campus News Editor Justin Smirlies jsmirlies@thecord.ca N Wilfrid Laurier University professor Sean Doherty studies the nature of diabetes in relation to location. Studying diabetes with GPS Prof explores blood glucose levels over geographical spaces MARISSA EVANS STAFF WRITER For many, the GPS systems built into our smartphones are nothing more than a convenience when we are trying to find the closest gas sta-tion or a helpful tool when we are lost. However, Sean Doherty, a geogra-phy and environmental studies pro-fessor at Wilfrid Laurier University, saw potential in these seemingly mundane tools as devices which could enhance the health of individ-uals with diabetes. His research pa-per entitled \"Exploring Blood Glu-cose Level over Geographical Space\" outlines the study he conducted re-garding the trends of glucose levels in the day to day travels and activi-ties of people with diabetes. Doherty initially dabbled with the idea of using GPS systems to track people in urban studies he was con-ducting. He soon realized, however, that this provided an accurate depic-tion of human exposure - namely where they were spending time and what activities they were engaging m. \"I realized it has direct irnpli-cations for your health,\" he said, speaking to the usefulness of the GPS data collected. These systems could be used to track patients with diabetes to pro-duce a precise depiction of their dai-ly activities. When speaking with doctors at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, they were largely interested in the objective information about their patients that this system would pro-vide them with. Two different systems were used to gather information: one being a GPS which collected data every second, and the other being an ac-celerometer which collected data 25 times a second. \"The accelerometer is like ape-dometer;' Doherty explained. \"Ex-cept it not only measures up and down, but also side to side as well as back and forth motions.\" With the data collected, Doherty had an illustration of where the in-dividual was, what they were doing and whether their glucose level was being affected. Doherty explained how he started by producing a map of the person's glucose every five minutes as they moved around in space. \"That turned out to be inc red-ibly novel. No one's ever done that;' Doherty imparted. This map brought a new con-cept, allowing Doherty to examine the question: does the environment people are in effect their glucose levels? However, his findings re-vealed that it's very individualistic. \"I was trying to make the point that, in different locations, people's lives had different effects on their glucose;' he explained. There was variation, however. While being far away from home may cause one person's glucose to rise significantly, it may cause an-other's to drop, and another may experience no changes. Therefore, , the study's findings couldn't be generalized. Rather, Doherty says that health geography is applicable in other ways. \"What this leads us to discov-ering are real behavioural changes that will improve people's health over time;' he noted, going on to ex-plain how it's the accumulation of factors that cause adult onset diabe-tes to develop. If these factors could be identified and the patient advised to reduce them, the diabetes may be avoided. \"At the end of this paper I can de-finitively say that at best it's going to lead to a new way of managing the disease,• Doherty said. For example, if it is identified that one particular patient's glucose lev-els rise when they are far away from home, then doctors can engage them in conversation about it. \"Now let's say I give the person with diabetes a smartphone with an application that looks specifically for times when they remain at one location for more than an hour;' he explained. The idea is that when it identifies that situation, it warns them that they should prick their finger and test their glucose level. Mostly Doherty is devoting his time to creating algorithms that could analyze this data to make it easier for healthcare professionals. While this is a complicated process that requires the consideration of many factors, Doherty believes this study was the first step. \"There's a lot of work to do;' he said. \"But this paper is draw-ing attention because it's showing promise:' Food for Fines Campaign Donate between November 21 to December 16 Reduce your Laurier Library fines while supporting the Laurier Student Food Bank.

NOVEMBER 23. 2011 Reviving the N DP club Group re-forms after three-year absence ELIZABETH DICESARE STAFF WRITER After nearly three years of being inactive, a group of Wilfrid Laurier University students, with help from the New Democratic Party commu-nity within Kitchener-Waterloo, has revived WLU's NDP club on campus. The club has been re-formed be-cause \"ofrecentNDP success in fed-eral elections,\" explained Richelle Batuigas, the club's president. \"(The success] motivated us to bring the club back together, espe-cially since a number ofNDP sup-porters are youth .... We thought there should be an NDP body on campus;' she continued. The presence of Liberal and Con-servative clubs on campus was also a form of motivation to bring back the NDP club. Batuigas explained that the deci-sion to revive the club was solely a result of students. There was no in-fluence from any professors, but the decision did involve some commu-nity members. \"We're really connected with the community, so we always have com-munity members coming to talk to us and guiding us;' stated Batuigas. The main goal of the NDP club is to promote awareness and engage students in politics, whether at the federal or provincial level. \"We're not only existing to dem-onstrate NDP support, but also to encourage youth participation in elections, voting, government and to support those with progressive val-ues;' explained Batuigas. Eric Reis, the club's policy direc-tor, added that the NDP club is not just a social group:'We do try and engage the student population in elections as much as possible:' Reis also stressed that active par-ticipation from youth is extremely important in elections. He added that students need to be more aware of elections because \"either provin-cial or federal politics can directly influence students now or have definite influences to them in the future:' In order to get students more involved with the NDP party, and elections in general, the NDP club tries to have a strong presence on campus. \"[There is J a huge lack of awareness on campus;' stated Ba-tuigas. \"So I guess one way to en-courage participation is bringing awareness:' While on campus, they try to en-gage students in the NDP party's goals, the region's candidates, and politics and elections in general. Batuigas explained that students should know that politics have a lot to do with their lives. Different par-ties have different effects on educa-tion, tuition, student housing and provincial policies, which all posi-tively or negatively effect youth. One event the NDP club is plan-ning to raise awareness on campus is a mock election involving campus clubs. Any club members who are interested would be invited to come. Batuigas explained that the or-ganizers would \"hash out policies, but it wouldn't be anything serious. It would be more fun ... and [show] how parliament works:' This event would also be done in collaboration with other political clubs on campus. Finding your 'Klondike' I JUSTIN SMIRLIES CAMPUS NEWS EDITOR \"Questions are very important, and I'll tell you why;' began Robert Co-lombo, as he spoke at Wilfrid La uri-er University last Thursday evening. Speaking at the Paul Martin Cen-tre, Colombo, a distinguished Cana-dian author and editor, offered his advice to students about the world of publishing. By retracing his life all the way to when he was child in Kitchener-Wa-terloo, Colombo explained the many pinnacles of his career, including being able to study under Marshall McLuhan to writing his own po-etry and anthologies. To Colombo though, in order to get somewhere, specializing in a particular topic is key. To find this, as Colombo intro-duced the talk, was to ask questions. \"Try and develop your own Klon-dike, something you do and that no-body else does;' explained Colombo. However, even though he has en-joyed his career, Colombo did warn that publishing doesn't pay ex-tremely well. \"I enjoyed doing what I was do-ing, but there was a future in editing and I saw no editing in my future;• he added, noting that it was hard to support a family in that field. \"I felt that I would need to scale down the editing and begin to publish my own books:· His work as a poet didn't fare much better. \"No money in that, that's why it's called free verse;' he joked. Though he brought attention to the financial aspect of publishing and writing, Colombo ultimately encouraged the audience to fol-low their own passion. \"If a man or woman have a passion, they should share it with other people,\" he continued. NICK LACHANCE PHOTO MANAGER In addition to his advice about finding a specialization, Colombo offered other pieces of advice such as reading multiple hours a day and learning how to gauge an audience, whether that be in person, on print or on the Internet. As digitized forms of media be-come more popular than print, Co-lombo sees it as a double-bind. \"People will have more facts at their fingerprints; you used to have to go through encyclopedias;' he told The Cord. However, the biggest issue he foresees with social media and the Internet is the lack of indi-viduality and self-editing in future generations. He added that is was very \"dis-couraging\" to see the lack of conduct in online forums where some users take the liberty to post obscenities. To conclude his talk, Colombo of-fered two final pieces of heartfelt advice: to do at least one weird thing a week and to find a suitable partner that will support you through your career. \"Believe me, it has worked for me and it works for you,\" he said.

NOVEMBER 23. 2011 LOCAL Local Editor Amanda Steiner asteiner@thecord.ca ech'ldren.com ROSALIE EID PHOTOGRAPHY MANAGER Craig Kielburger, founder of Free the Children at age 12, poses happily for his photo at this year's We Day celebration held in Kitchener. We Day hits Waterloo region NICOLE GREEN STAFF WRITER \"You are the generation I've been waiting for;' cheered actress and fi-lanthropist Mia Farrow to a crowd of over 6,ooo youth that filled the Kitchener Auditorium last Wednes-day, Nov. 17, for K-W's second an-nual We Day. We Day is the largest youth em-powerment event of its kind. Led by Craig and Marc Kielburger and their charitable organization Free the Children, it is a day dedicated to inspiring the youth of this genera-tion to make positive change in the world. This year over 62,000 youth will attend We Days across Canada. This includes the 6,ooo students from over 200 schools in Waterloo Region. Sponsored by Research in Mo-tion, the cost of a ticket is simply demonstrating leadership and vol-unteerism within the community. Don Morrison, Research in Motion CEO, encouraged youth to be the change. \"We are the change. We are the hope. We are the me, in 'me to we·;· he said. Last year We Day youth had logged 1.7 million volunteer hours and raised 5·4 million dollars. Hal-loween for Hunger is the larg-est single day of fundraising for non -perishable food items. In 2010, 519,000 lbs of non -perishable food items were raised by more than 180,000 youth on Oct. 31 alone. Free the Children was founded when Craig Kielb urger was just 12 years old. He was inspired by the headline: \"Battled Child Labour, Boy, 12, Murdered:' The story detailed the life oflqbal Masih, a Pakistani boy, who hades-caped child labour and at age twelve was shot and killed for leading a movement against child labour. With 11 classmates Kielburger de-cided to start Free the Children to combat child labour. \"15 years ago when we started Free the Children we got shoved into lockers it was so uncool;' said Craig. \"Now, today there are stadiums full of students cheering for social justice:' To date, Free the Children has built 650 schools that provide edu-cation for more than 55,000 chil-dren every day. 16 million US dol-lars worth of medical supplies has been shipped to over 40 developing countries. Hollywood icon and UNIFEC goodwill ambassador, Farrow was among the speakers present at We Day. \"The thing about Free the Chil-dren is, it isn't just the school it's the whole community,\" said Far-row. \"Aid is criticized ... But this Reserve your rate today and receive a is helping communities rise to the point where they can take care of themselves. It's smart:' \"The greatest gift you can give is to help someone so they never need help again;' said Kielburger. The all- star line up of speakers included James Ordinski, the only living Canadian to receive a Noble Peace Prize. David Martin and Cheif Laforme both spoke to raise awareness about the poverty and disconnect experi-enced by aboriginal youth. Keilburger announced that in February Me to We will be rolling out a campaign called Focus Spot-light to raise awareness about ab-original experiences in Canada. Among the most inspirational speakers was Michel Chikwanine, a child soldier who shared his story silently to demonstrate the power of silence and to stand up for those who have no voice. Instead Chik-wanine told his story by holding up large boards with text on it. \"I've heard his story four times now;• said audience member Brian Wilson. \"But hearing it that way was like I was hearing it for the first time:' Retired UN lieutenant-gener-al Romeo Dallaire also had a very powerful message after sharing his experiences in the Rwandan geno-cide he encouraged youth to \"dirty their boots\" by travelling to develop-ing nations as a rite of passage. \"Once you have seen and heard and felt and tasted and lived among the 8o per cent of humanity that is living in poor conditions;' said Dal-laire. \"You can come back and be the pilot light for us to change:' When the cast ofDegrassi and Michael Jordan hit the stage, the au-dience was electrified.

Some residents reacted poorly to this in-formation, wondering what they were receiving in return for these high taxes, however, Waterloo's crime rates are reasonably lower than the neighboring city of Kitch-ener, so this could be a considered bonus. The Record reported that the ex-planation lies within the taxes and that they rise with property val-ues. Waterloo has a robust real es-tate market and an average home is worth up to $62,000 more than an average home in Kitchener and Cambridge. As well, Waterloo resi-dents are in good shape to pay high taxes. A recent study found that es-timated household incomes are up to $20,460 higher than in Kitchener and Cambridge. -Compiled by Amanda Steiner Electric vehicles come to Waterloo Community Renewable Energy Wa-terloo is hosting an electric car event Thursday night, featuring screen-ings of the new documentary The Revenge of the Electric Car and ve-hicle displays.

NOVEMBER 23. 2011 ~~~~========================================~---=================== Proposed LRT routes adjusted AMANDA STEINER LOCAL AND NATIONAL EDITOR A vote this past June 15 concluded an eight-year discussion on future transit options in Waterloo Region with the decision ofregional coun-cil to implement Light Rail Transit (LRT). However, though LRT sup-port was considered overwhelm-ingly positive by most of the city, complications still arose and adjust-ments have still been made. \"The biggest change to the route was considering using the railway line that goes through Waterloo Square as opposed to Erb Street, from King [Street] to Caroline [Steet];' said Phil Hewitson, direc-tor of transportation for the city of Waterloo. \"Switching [the route] from Caro-line and William to Allan, having on the east side would interfere with the loading docks at the Brick Brew-ery. The challenges with site-lines, the trains would be running the op-posite direction to traffic but on the east side, the train would be running south and traffic north:' \"Since the 2009 decision;' Hew-rison continued, \"Transport Cana-da ruled that the freight trains and the LRT can share the same tracks, they just have to operate at differ-ent times. So that means the freight trains will operate at night, when transit doesn't operate. So there will only be one set of tracks going through Waterloo Square. We didn't oppose that, we didn't want two sets of tracks:' According to Hewitson, prog-ress to the regions new LRT system is being made, despite the changes and alterations made through the procedure. \"They want to start construction ~·HUMBER The Business School POSTGRADUATE CERTIFICATES IN: Event Management Financial Planning 2014, so it's still a couple years away;' he said. \"There's a lot of de-tailed design and there will be con-sultations in the mean time through the design process but their goal is to have construction started by 2014, and they estimate by 2017 it will be up and running:' Though considered by many throughout the region to be a posi-tive change for the community, some citizens still oppose the idea. \"Some people were still concerned after the workshop, but even at the workshop some of the residents agreed that it was a better alter-native, even though it might bring the train a little bit closer to their homes:· Hewitson assures residents, that LRT is very quiet, unlike a freight train. \"It is an electric train,\" he said. \"It won't have bells and whistles like the freight train does and it's a light-er vehicle. It doesn't cause a vibra-tion like a freight train does:• In fact, though some people also expressed concerns with LRT be-ing too close to their houses, this wouldn't be the case. The plans for the electric train are to place the tracks where the closest traffic lane already exists and then push the traffic lanes further. \"It won't be any closer than the travel lane where cars drive today;• Hewitson said. \"In fact, I think it might be better for the residents because they won't have cars so close to their homes, and cars are more frequent than the trains will be:' The decision has yet to be made but LRT might also stop running during certain hours of the night for maintenance, as it does in Toronto currently. Global Business Management Human Resources Management International Development International Marketing ROSALIE EID PHO~OGRAPHY MANAGER Young and old gathered together at Forest Hill United Church to celebrate Canada's mosaic of faiths. A celebration of faith MIKE RADIVOI STAFF WRITER This past Saturday Cross Cultures Maga2ine (CCM) presented a multi-faith gathering, or 'Panorama of Sacred Expression' hosted at For-est Hill United Church in Kitchener. Albeit a small gathering, those in attendance presented a mosaic of beliefs and stimulated a great deal of conversation. Event promotions described the event as an opportunity to share all things sacred from various religious faiths and denominations, and chal-lenged anyone to \"prove your faith has taught you love for all mankind:' Although admission was free, the event encouraged participants to donate any non-perishable food item to the Food Bank. Participants themselves were provided with food and refreshments, engaging in an informal meet-and-greet be-fore being seated for sharing and discussion. Gehan D. Sabry, the editor of CCM, organized the event. Origi-nally from Egypt, Sabry has lived in Canada for 24 years and considers herself a \"secular Muslim:' \"It's hard to go from a very uni-form kind of society to something more diverse without adjusting so-cially\" said Sabry. \"Whatever eth-nicity, faith, background, we are all human beings. There is no reason for one to think they are more or less than the other.\" Attendees participated in group meditation as well as being taught a bit of Hebrew by one speaker. For some present, these actions created discomfort rather than harmony. Edwin Laryea is a Canadian resident originally from Ghana. He described his experiences to the group, going over how his faith background was polytheistic and involved veneration of his ancestors. \"It makes me feel less than equal;' said Laryea, \"Let me explain why. It is because I have no religion. How do these religions make me feel welcome? And equal?\" The issue did not seem novel to the group, but rather one mutu-ally lived and experienced. Rev-erend Murray McLeod, one of the ministers for Forest Hill United, shared his concerns on this topic of inclusion. \"For me, faith is about identity. Who am I, and how do I relate to .you?\" said McLeod, \"One of the places that most religious tradi-tions fall down is when we forget that faith is about identity and start thinking it's about power. Especially power over others.\" Originally from Pakistan, Ansar Ra2a has lived in Canada for 14 years and is a missionary for the Ahmadi-yya Muslim community. He spoke of his faith and his appreciation for the freedom to express it. At a similar event, Ra2a said someone had asked him a question: Do you love your country of resi-dence, or your country of your birth? Ra2a related his experiences to those of the prophet Muhammad. \"I am a follower of Prophet Mu-hammad (peace be upon him) ;• he said. \"He was born in Mecca, but to avoid persecution had to migrate to another place ... When the people asked him if he would return to his native land, he said no. He said 'you gave me shelter when everyone was persecuting me.

You have a vagina, you're a girl:\" The Rainbow Centre, Laurier's safe space for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community, coordinated last week with the Centre for Women and Trans* People to host their second annual cel-ebration ofTrans Awareness Week, a week dedicated to rejecting transphobia, gender binary and social norms sur-rounding gender. In honour of the week, The Cord sat down with Jane and listened to her story, learned what life as a trans woman entails and gained perspective on what is still an under-exposed topic. An outs1d~ metamorphosis \"A trans person is someone whose gender does not match the one that they were assigned at birth;' Owen elaborated. \"They may transition - or they may not:' The physical transition is a process that some trans people go through so that their physical body matches their gender. The process usually begins with hormone therapy, followed by supplementary sur-geries such as chest surgery and the filing of the Adam's apple and finally full gender reassignment sur-gery involving the reconstructing of the genitalia. Not all transition processes are the same, but Jane is someone who intends to fully physically transition. Though she hasn't begun hormone therapy yet, she has big plans for the future. \"I intend to go all the way;' she explained. \"Ideally I would like to be able to have kids but I know that's not possible. Hopefully someday medical developments will allow me that possibility. Right now I'm just trying to correct a mistake that nature - or God, or whatever you believe in - made. Mistakes happen:' \"Even when you get into those little subculture labels - like jock, nerd, band geek -there are different gender roles you have to fit into;' Jane explained. \"There always seems to be that division between how a boy is supposed to act and how a girl is supposed to act:' Jane was aware of the social stereotypes surrounding gender from a very young age. \"When you're little and you play with toys, boys are supposed to be into the big, strong, burly athletic types -those are their heroes,\" she said. \"Girls, you're taught to be more sweet and submissive -princess-types:' When Jane decided to come out this summer, she took a risk and tied her long black hair back and put on women's clothes on a night out with friends. \"It felt amazing,\" she recalled. \"I was out with a group of friends and we decided to go bar-hopping;' she ex-plained excitedly. \"At one bar it was ladies night, ladies didn't have to pay cover, and I got in for free:' Of course, since embracing her identity, Jane still has several bumps to get over. 'T m not very good with hair or makeup yet;' she admitted. \"But I'm learning!\" 1 .r Since her coming out, things haven't been as simple as dressing up and having fun with her girlfriends. Like almost all trans people, Jane has had to deal with ignorance. Jane had apprehensions before returning to Laurier at the end of this past summer. \"I had prepared myself for the worst, but no one really said or did anything that was very hurtful - to my face. What I found was it was more of a passive-aggression;' she said. ''I'm getting looks like, 'Ew, look at that ... whatever: I think people are bothered but they're not telling me because they don't think they're supposed to, but that mentality was still there. It isn't always something people understand, sometimes it goes against their belief system:' Because of the lack of positive portrayal of trans people in the media, transphobia still runs rampant in many settings. While Jane has stated that she's never been explicitly attacked for her gender ex-pression, she feels that being trans makes her peers squeamish around her. \"Everything I do is sort of put through a lens;' she said. 'T m a very touchy-feely person and I like to hug every-one, but I'm the only one getting flack for it.

You could go back and forth day by day, and that's okay.\" School has just been one of the hurdles of the transition. Back at home, Jane is dealing with her parents' struggle to accept her identity. \"They didn't react in the worst way possible,\" she said. \"They didn't kick me out or anything. But my father goes back and forth from one day saying, 'I love you no matter what; to, 'you'll never be a real woman, you can't have kids:\" Many trans people feel that public bathrooms are one of the most difficult aspects of being out in public, especially be-fore the point of physical transition or passing. Many public places in Canada have debated implementing non -gender specific washrooms, which would aid in relieving some of the anxieties that trans individuals feel. Recently, schools in Western Canada made news when they debated the implementation of gender-neutral washrooms. Though Laurier has not yet discussed the matter, Jane has found that there are many trans-positive spaces and people on campus. \"The Rainbow Centre has been wonderful,\" she said, ''And my friends, my roommates [and] the people I volunteer with have all been a great support:' Compared to others, Jane has had it easy so far. November 20 is an international Trans day of remembrance to honour those who have lost their lives to both transphobic violence and suicide as a result of depression or alienation.

The suicide rates are tragic, but sadly not alarming when considering the amount of violence against trans people. The Transgender Community Health Project reports that 86 per cent of trans people expe-rience verbal abuse and discrimination on a regular basis, and 35 per cent are victims of physical violence. Trans adults also report experiencing discrimination when applying for work or seeking housing. The organization Youth Pride reports that over go per cent of trans students feel unsafe on their high school, college and university campuses. With the safe spaces on her side, Jane feels empowered but still apprehensive. \"I like that I can feel safe to be myself here;' she said. \"But at the same time because of the reactions I've gotten from some people, I'm not going to go around like, 'Hi, I'm trans!'

PHOTOS BY NICK LACHANCE PHOTO MANIPULATION BY WADE THOMPSON AND TAYLOR GAYOWSKY 10 • EDITORIAL Expletive-filled Twitter rant unbecoming of public figure New Democrat Pat Martin became a trending topic on Twitter after his political adversaries called his exple-tive-filled rant into question. In response to the Con-servative government limiting debate on the budget, Martin called the decision \"a fucking disgrace\" and said \"fuckyou\" to one of his followers who called him a \"foul mouth socialist:' While it is refreshing that a member of parliament has offered such candor about their positions, this type of conduct is unbecoming of a public figure and Martin should refrain from using such language in his tweets, especially while in the House of Commons. While the first tweet is more excusable than the one directed at a voter, it was inappropriate of Martin to portray his frustration in such a way. Calls for Martin to apologize, however, are mis-guided for several reasons. First, any apology he is-sued would be empty and insincere. Martin clearly has strong feelings of animosity toward the Harper gov-ernment and he shouldn't apologize for holding such beliefs. Second, Martin does have a point about the conduct of the Harper government and, at the very least, he incited a conversation about the validity of the Con-servatives' decision to limit debate. Martin is correct in questioning whether this type of limitation is be-coming of a proclaimed democracy. Furthermore, his passion in addressing this issue - while exerted in an over-the-top fashion - is commendable. Twitter and, by extension, social media in general is a tremendous platform for politicians to connect with their constituents and provide a real-time account of the processes of government. By no means should MPs limit their use of social media or shy away from it in the wake of Martin's misstep. Yet, all MPs should take a lesson from this and real-ize that social media is no different than standing up to give a speech in the House of Commons. It will be scrutinized and debated in the same way. Being an ac-cessible government official is of paramount impor-tance and MPs must never lose sight of that, but they must also keep their comments respectful. They are, after all, the representatives of our coun-try. They should act like it. -The Cord Editorial Board Effectiveness of We Day should be questioned There is no doubt that the We Day event held last week at the Kitchener Memorial Auditorium was well-in-tentioned, designed to inspire the 6,ooo students who attended to make the world a better place. It is impor-tant to question, though, how much of this event is ac-tually about making a difference and how much of it is about making a big splash. While other speakers attended the conference, the ones who received the media attention afterward were the celebrities. What began as a grassroots event to inspire youth has become a place for celebrities to get some press and attract a crowd. How much could the celebrity class be accomplishing on its own if it actual-ly harnessed its massive collective monetary potential to do good deeds? At the root ofWe Day is a group called Free the Chil-dren, founded by brothers Craig and Marc Kielburger who set out to abolish child labour in the third world. The benefits of the foundation, however, have been called into question. Give Well, an organization that evaluates the in ten-tions of various charitable organizations, did not clear Free the Children based on two criteria: the lack of substantial evidence regarding the impact of the chari-ty's work and the lack of quantitative assessment avail-able to judge the charity's effectiveness. As the orga-nizers for this event, Free the Children should be pro-viding a broader picture of the effectiveness pf its aid. As an inspirational event, it is well executed and hopefully students actually take something away from it. It is necessary, however, to evaluate the actual aid that this event generates and whether it is truly about changing the world. -The Cord Editorial Board This unsigned editorial is based off informal discussions and then agreed upon by the majority of The Cord's editorial board, which consists of 14 senior Cord staff including the Editor-in-Chief and Opinion Editor.

Anti-bu llyi r:~g bill mor.e harmful than helpful BREE RODY-MANTHA FEATURES EDITOR In light of the disturbingly high num-her of recent teen suicides - many be-ing members of the lesbian, gay, bisex-ual, transgendered and queer (LGBTQ) community - the state of Michigan has finally passed a bill that would force all schools to develop anti-bullying poli-cies, ensuring the protection of children who are victimized. The law was given the name \"Matt's safe school law\" after East Lansing's Matt Epling who ended his life after years of abuse at the hands of his peers. Problematically, shortly before the passing of the bill, state senate Republi-cans tacked on a statement that bullying based on \"a sincerely held religious be-lief or moral conviction of a school em-ployee, school volunteer, pupil or a pu-pil's parent or guardian\" was to be an ex-ception to these anti-bullying policies. This statement assures that LGBTQ students will still be denied protection by their schools. The Republican state legislature has stated that they are looking to find a middle ground that does not \"enumer-ate specific groups for extra protection;' but also a bill that \"would [not] provide an excuse for someone to bully some-one else:' When will Republicans and other an-ti-gay groups accept that providing the LGBTQ community with the rights to not walk out their doors and be harassed is not \"extra protection?\" Additionally, it is not ridiculous to say that the LGBTQ community is in need of extra protection as long as there is ex-tra ammunition against them.

Sometimes, extra protection is necessary. In their tweaking of this once well-intentioned bill, the Republicans have done exactly what they claim to be against and have provided students ex-cuses to torment peers who happen to be part of the LGBTQ community or have parents who are part of that community. They have also inadvertently enumer-ated a specific group for extra protec-tion- religious students (though one has to wonder to what extent Republi-cans would want this law to protect, say, Muslim students.) The religious right often attempts to paint itself as a persecuted minority, specifically when it comes to in-school politics. Outrageous and most likely ex-aggerated claims have been made that schools allow students of non-Christian religions to pray in school, but outright punish Christian students who pray. All claims that Christian students are vic-tims in the schools no longer hold any water now that state law gives them carte blanche to abuse others in the name of their religious beliefs. This law also even excuses educators and school administrators from alien-ating these students when they are the ones who should be providing comfort and protection. As someone who was the victim of bullying for many years in elementary school, I can safely say that the schools need to play a large part in offering stu-dents protection. Many critics of anti-bullying legisla-tion claim that all damage control can be done in the home. I was one student who was lucky enough to have a supportive family as well as a single supportive teacher -my music teacher - who allowed me to spend my lunch hours in her classroom instead of out in the schoolyard with my tormentors. Not every child has such luxury. Many have a difficult time being open with their parents, especially when it comes to matters such as their sexual-ity or gender identity. There is also a large line-up of crit-ics who claim that bullies are merely ex-ercising their right to free speech. The \"free speech\" debate can stretch on for days, but free speech does not condone abuse. No one will ever find a way to give every group the right to say anything without infringing on someone's rights. However, when children are at stake, it's best to go with the solution which causes the least amount of pain and suf-fering for everyone. That was not the solution that was chosen here. Bullies - whether they are Christian, atheist, Muslim or Jewish - do not de-serve justification for their actions. Bul-lying is never justified- that's why it's bullying. THE CORD • WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER 23. 2011 Greece was on the verge of debt crisis for years ALEXANDROS MITSIOPOULOS CORD CONTRIBUTOR I was sitting at an intersection in my uncle's car in Athens on one of my days off this past April. We were idling in a traffic jam at one of the busiest intersections following an-other routine general strike by the electric company. This was the third day without traffic lights city wide. I noticed a motorist get out of his car, approach another, then proceeded to pull the driver out and beat him with a tire iron. I looked at my uncle for some sort of acknowledgment of what had happened. He turned to me as if he had woken up from a daydream. \"Forget about it, Alex;' he tells me. \"People are just really tense right now:' Fast-forward seven months and the discontent is just as preva-lent. Pressures from the European Union (EU) to find a solution to the debt crisis and help restore balance to the global economy have taken its toll on tiny Greece. In years past, general strikes were seemingly unremarkable. They be-came as routine as the Easter holi-day year after year. However ten-sions have risen beyond civil dis-obedience. That moment of incep-tion seemed to be in May 2010 when three employees were burned alive at the Marfin bank following a petrol bomb attack in Athens. With a grim outlook both in the economic :lnd ~oclal re'ii.lfns, an eyes are on political leadership as it suf-fers its own crisis of sorts. The last in the Papandreou po-litical dynasty, Greek Prime Minis-ter Georgos Papandreou had made clear his defiance to see out the rest of his term despite his claims to the contrary. In fact, it should have come without surprise to onlookers of the Greek political theatre. His demise began with the an-noun cement of the referendum, once again hurdling Europe into economic despair. Following an emergency meeting in Cannes and dominating the itinerary at the G2o Online this week: Hayden Starczala explores the ongoing Iran-Israel dispute Amelia Calbry-Muzyka says Penn State created a culture that condoned Joe Paterno's actions lan Merkley favours the Keystone oil pipeline and why it's good for the American economy Chris Oberle on how student clubs can finance their activities t:' .~ , ... MITCHELL CHEESEMAN GRAPHICS ARTIST summit, Papandreou faced censure domestically as well. Upon return, three members of parliament (MPs) from his own Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party nearly crossed the floor. Having just bare-ly survived a confidence vote after finally scrapping the referendum, it was clear that Papandreou would not be able to muster the two-thirds support to approve the EU bailout proposal on his own. Many have called to question the reasons behind calling a referendum in the first place. Internationally ed-ucated, Papandreou had the capacity to foresee the volatility in his choice. What was it that compelled him to suggest a referendum without the consultation of his cabinet nor his EU partners? As always the answer is both simple and complicated. P'affiufdreotJ. recetved'h;ftsh criticism for the way he handled Greece's finances. He has faced re-sistance from within PASOK, from the opposition and from Greek citi-zens who have challenged what has now become one of the toughest austerity measures ever to be imple-mented in recent memory. Papan-dreou has been accused of a ban-cloning the wellbeing of the Greek people in favour of investors and the financialsector. Furthermore, Papandreou is held accountable for submitting to the will of his EU colleagues, sacrificing the sovereignty and integrity of ... campus construction. Some-one said to me during the sum-mer that there are two seasons in Canada: winter and construction. In that case, Laurier has one sea-son: construction. In all my time at Laurier, I do not think there has ever been a point there has not been construction. I get that Laurier is a growing school, and that we need to create more space, but if you think about it, little of the recent construction does, except for the new Global In-novation Exchange building. Firstly, this construction incon-veniences everyone. For well over a year now, students coming from numerous residences have been hindered by all the construction, es-pecially by the area blocked off near the Terrace. While I understand that construction is a necessary part of general upkeep, what possible proj-ects have taken this long? In addi-tion, what construction company has managed to make the job last this long? It seems to me that some-thing is wrong here. Greece's statehood. Casually un-derstood that the idea came from a public poll, Papandreou wanted to gain Greece's public endorsement of the austerity measures and ulti-mately its continuing membership intheEU. Despite best intentions the plan did not work. Good intentions are typically the first casualties in crises, a sentiment well learned following the defeat of Kostas Karamanlis in 2009. Papandreou's actions didn't take long to reverberate off oflocal news media and paint a vivid im-age of the short time that remained for him in office. His decision to go along with a referendum is evidence of a disempowered leader acting in desperation to gather whatever support remained. He acted out of frustration with a brash and myopic plan. Having lost all credibility and heeding aggressive calls, Papan-dreou formally stepped down earlier this month. In his place, Lucas Papademos has assumed the thankless role of interim Greek prime minister. Out-side of conventional political circles and armed with a coalition govern-ment, he stands as the best chance Greece has to move forward with the EU. While still knee-deep in debt, now is a time for prioritiza-tion. Among many qualities, Pa-pademos possesses a profound self awareness. He realizes that he serves a very limited and functional role: the im-plementation of the EU austerity package. Having just won a vote of confidence and cabinet approval of the 2012 budget, Papademos should be able to proceed unobstructed de-spite some minor setbacks from the rar-n~r.- • Greece had within its grasp a beautiful moment of reinvention; a moment to refute its past of nepo-tism and corruption and prove that it still belonged as a robust member of the world's largest single-market union. 111atmomentwaslostsome-where between Syntagma Square and the Marfin Bank.

Once again, we see where the ad-ministration's priorities are situ-ated: give the business kids every-thing, fuck the arts students. 111e worst part of all is we are paying for it. You and I are paying to be inconvenienced and to have our classes moved all around. What a lovely waste of money. -Alex Reinhart OPINION • 11 ROSALIE EID PHOTOGRAPHY MANAGER I would think twice about getting inked BREE BORSELLINO OPINION COLUMNIST Anyone who takes the bus fre-quently, or even those who sub-merge themselves in public crowds, 'ttnttWs ltow diverse this country's people are. So many different cul-tures, ethnicities and religions can be seen anywhere you look. 111at's partially why I love people-watch-ing - it can be so interesting. But something I saw a few months back is only now really making me think about tradition, culture and reli-gion and how they intertwine. I've seen this \"something\" numerous times throughout my life, but one recent incident made me look at it differently. I was heading towards school on the iXpress when a man came on the bus and took a seat. Upon first glance I could tell that the guy was a bit different and I don't mean differ-ent in an insulting way - it's more of an expressive or possibly artistic kind of different. He had piercings on multiple places of his face: one on his eyebrow, several in his ears and he also had snakebite piercings. When I saw the rest of his appear-ance though, I was both amazed and confused. His arms, legs and neck were covered with an intricate and complex lacing of tattoos. It was amazing to me because it was so co-lourful and elaborate in its designs, but I was confused because I know the pain of getting even just one tattoo since I held my best friend's hand when she got hers. After I got off the bus, I complete-ly forgot about him. But any time I see someone with a tattoo, a picture from my memory of that man comes back into my mind. It's something that continues to intrigue me, so I figured I'd do some research about tattoos: their place in culture, reli-gion and tradition. 111e practice of tattooing the human body has been going on for thousands of years and has mostly meant something per-sonal to the person acting as a can-vas. According to Cate Lineberry, tattoos have \"served as amulets, status symbols, declarations oflove, signs of religious beliefs, adorn-ments and even forms of punish-ment.\" I completely understand the meanings of status symbols, love declarations and religious signs, but I can't help but wonder why peo-ple would actually want to engrave ===,,=== The idea of getting a tattoo is somewhat enticing to me, simply because I really like art, but it's also a bit nerve-wracking since it's permanent. I say, why would I waste the money? something into their skin. It just seems too painful to me. Tattoos were most likely first seen on the mummies of ancient Egyptians, but I'm going to take a stab and say that Egyptians dated around 2000 B.C. had many differ-ent beliefs, practices and religions than what we have today in Canada. I'm relating this specifically to the \"I heart Ian\" or \"I heart Jessica\" tattoos that I see on so many young adults who think they're in love but end up splitting. My point is that Egyptians may have had a much deeper meaning and relation behind their tattoos than what we place behind ours today. Perhaps most of their tat-toos were symbols of their religion, something deeply rooted in their beliefs and something they'd hold onto before and after their lives. Once again relating to my example of the \"I heart\" tattoos, my older sister always tells me to never get one because they're addicting, and I'll probably regret anything I have written or drawn on my body be-cause I'm so young. Thinking about it, I can honestly say that I agree with her. 111e idea cif a tattoo is somewhat enticing to me, simply because I really love art, but it's also a bit nerve-wracking since it's permanent. And the process of removing it, I'm guessing, will be just as painful and as expensive as getting it done. So why would I waste my money? I know a few people who are completely against getting tattoos and of course some who are totally for it. I'd say I'm more neutral about the subject. As cultural symbols, I think tattoos are awesome, but I'd definitely think twice about hav-ing Winnie the Pooh stamped on my arm. 12 • ARTS Arts Editor Liz Smith lsmith@thecord.ca THE CORD • WEDNESDAY. NOVEMBER 23. 2011 The Darcys play abbreviated Maxwell's set COLLEEN CONNOLLY CORD ARTS One ofToronto's latest up and com-ing rock bands, The Darcys, played a show alongside Amos the Transpar-ent on the stage of Maxwell's Music House this past Thursday evening. The venue provided an intimate set-ting for the young musicians, plac-ing them in close range to a rather modest and scattered audience. With a hauntingly mellow elec-tronic ambiance to their music, the atmosphere was ideal for a fan of the particular genera. However, it is safe to say The Darcys have a sound that is all their own. \"We've focused a lot in the last few years on creating our own sound as far as the noise is con-cerned on the record. It's a lot of dis -tortion and delay noise and that is something that a lot of bands aren't doing. Instead of going out there and trying to replicate something that's been done. We try to create our own [sound] ;• said drummer Wes Marskell in an interview with The Cord. This particular quality makes The Darcys hard to pin-pointin re-gards to style. \"The tagline has been art rock, but we're just a rock band I think. Because we don't have the standard verse chorus layout of the songs we get that art rock label be-cause they're not structured like pop songs. But we're more or less just a rock band, in my mind anyways;' commented Marskell. With a new record released this year that can be downloaded for free on the band's website, Water-loo was just a short stop in The Dar-cys' recent promotional tour across Canada. Unfortunately, the stop was much shorter than we could have expected, as the band finished up their set after only a few songs without much more of an explana-tion than that a member had taken ill. Later, the band took to their THE DARCYS CONTRIBUTED IMAGE Twitter, letting fans know, \"Dave [The Darcys bassist] fainted during our set tonight in Waterloo. He is feeling better now. Sorry to every-one who came out & we will see you tomorrow in Toronto:' The Darcys' recently released self-titled record marks a significant point in the progression of The Dar-cys' musical career, according to the band. \"We were very unknown, and then all of a sudden this record came out. 2006 was when we sort of be-came a band, but we were just a bunch of drunk dudes who wanted to meet girls in Halifax and then when we made this record it was a little bit more serious. We had one record before this one but it doesn't count in the same way,\" remarked Marskell. Developed over the last three years, the record has been quite a project for The Darcys as Marskell explained, \"It has a lot to do with distance and space and recreating emotions. There's a lot of noise on the record and we sort of try to make these noises to create moments:' The group truly embodies the dream of every aspiring Canadian garage band, having gone through the same struggles along the way without accepting defeat. ''I've been doing this for such a long time as just guys, growing up, being in a band in high school,\" re-flected Marskell, continuing, \"I think it's really easy to get discour-aged if your band breaks down or your lead singer quits. But it you have the drive and push through these things, miraculous things can happen:· Faculty of Music presents· Such Sweet Sorrow ALANNA FAIREY STAFF WRITER The Wilfrid Laurier University fac-ulty of music's latest production, Such Sweet Sorrow: an Evening of Mod-ern Opera Excerpts, successfully ac-complished the task of appealing to Wilfrid Laurier students and alumni alike. Such Sweet Sorrow is a poignant production dealing with themes of religion and the consequences that result in a lack of faith. The production, which took place in the Maureen Forrester Recital Hall on Nov. 18 and Nov. 19, pre-sented three excerpts from compo-sitions written by Laurier alumni and students. Andrea Wingelaar directed the production while Leslie De'Ath and Wayne Strongman con-tributed an elaborate musical ele-ment. The three excerpts of the op-eras were listed as May 23, written by fourth-year composition major Da-vid Foley, One Lump or Two by Laurier alumnus Glenn James and Ruth by Laurier alumnus Jeffrey Ryan. Each production centred on the prevalent themes of faith, while pre-senting in various forms feelings of angst, comic relief and religious motifs through the use of song. The immense talents of the cast were the main attraction, overpowering the simplistic setting and basic black costumes. The cast sang in perfect harmony, never missing a beat and projecting their powerful voices for those sit-ting in the back of the theatre. Sev-eral songs had the power to send goosebumps down the backs of au-dience members. Although all three excerpts were successful, Foley's May 23 was the most memorable and poignant performance of the evening. May 23, which follows the life of a man named Henry and his dis-connection from the world around him, was Foley's first production. \"I didn't expect it to go to produc-tion. I was just writing it and hoped it would be produced but through talking to the opera directors here, I managed to get it on the program,\" Foley shared. The inspiration for May 23 came to Foley at the end of his second year of study at Laurier, when he first became interested in opera. During this time, Foley had also seen a film that coincided with his ideas and love of opera. He then decided to take a risk and began to write the play. May 23, which deals with the theme of suicide, is Foley's way of reaching out to those who are suffering. \"One message that I want to put forth is that sometimes suicide is the only option to some people's lives and we should be able to stop them before it has to come to that;' Foley added. The faculty of music was success-ful in their production of Such Sweet Sorrow, as they continued to display the talented singers and composers that study at Laurier.

As co-hostAnne Hathaway's bubbly en-thusiasm failed to counterbalance the dead weight that was her hosting counterpart, the leaden James Fran-co, who was infamously rumoured to be high during the ceremonies, it was clear that the anticipated 'young blood' approach to hosting was fla-grantly unsuccessful, prompting a revamped approach for this year. Nonetheless, the preparations for the Academy Awards have prompt-ed an uproar of politics, tension and unintentional humour unlike any ceremony in years. Perhaps most controversial was the appointment of director Brett Ratner of Rush Hour and (prepare to gnash your teeth) X-Men: The Last Stand fame, as co-producer of the ceremonies. While some thought Ratner's ris-que comedic sensibilities would punch some much needed life into the notoriously dry ceremonies, others were concerned that his usu-al brand of self-indulgent crudity would dispel the usual vestiges of panache the Academy struggles to maintain. Ratner's choice of host, comedy legend Eddie Murphy, elicited feel-JESSICA MITRA GRAPHICS ARTIST ings of relief in many, though many remained anxious that the reprised collaboration of the two would turn the Oscars into Tower Heist 2 - flim-sy satire and ill-conceived racial hu-mour included. At any rate, it seemed apparent that, whether promising or cringe-worthy, the Academy appeared to be tapping into public sensibilities to try to again, to do something point-edly different than the past. However, this was not to be the case. During a publicity tour for Tower Heist, Ratner's mouth got the better of him, resulting in him mak-ing several crude references to his sex life and (allegedly unintention-al) homophobic slurs. Despite nu-merous public apologies by Ratner, the publicity backlash led to him \"resigning\" as producer, with friend and collaborator Murphy quickly following. Now forced to re-fill the positions of producer and host while subject to considerable scrutiny, it would seem the Academy considered this turn of events as representative of taking a chance on a new approach, as their new appointments, produc-er Brian Grazer and eight-time ·host Billy Crystal, epitomized the notion of 'safe'. As Grazer stated, \"Humour and comedy are going to be our tentpole. We're not going to try to reinvent the wheel. Our obligation to the Academy is to respect it:' While the reappointment of the beloved Crystal was a source of adu-lation for many, the Ratner debacle and the Academy's recovery from it does provide considerable insight into the inner workings of the A cad-emyitsel£ Tellingly enough, last year's cer-emonies, which arguably took the biggest chance in a while with the youngest hosts to date who were also not specifically anchored as being comedic (like Crystal), also shoehorned in an almost uncom-fortably overt succession of allu-sions to the history and tradition of the Oscars, as if desperately trying to assert more relevance than a bur-geoning desire to appear 'hip' and 'cool'. Likewise this year, in the face of scrutiny and controversy, the Acad-emy reverted to the most traditional, 'safe' framework of the past with Crystal and his patented approach to hosting. While the adage \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" does come to mind, the projected 'image' of the Oscars in terms of an evolving entity attempt-ing to address a technological age where audiences appear less in-dined to sit in a cinema to watch films, remains even more unfixed and uncertain than ever. It will be interesting to see how the ratings reflect the 'safe' choice of Crystal as host, and whether, in or-der to reassert relevance, the Oscars will revert to such drastic ends as (God forbid) hiring the Twilight stars to host next year's ceremonies. \\11· ,JI thecord_ca /r l/ . 11 1 · c \\ t< \\ ,, Liz Smith's ( < JVr ·r, 11 /(' r ;f II 11 · \\IV, II ( ,,, I J ( ) I ( \" ' I 1\\ l J I I I ) ! . \\I )/I ) I' I I ('( i ( I! }I 'I I I' I The latest news in entertainment \"Next time on Arrested Development\" As early as 2013, it was announced-last week, new episodes of Arrested Development will be produced and streamed through Netflix as part of an exclusive distribution agreement.

NOVEMBER 23, 2011 SPORTS Sports Editor Kevin Campbell kcampbell@thecord.ca ROSALIE EID PHOTOGRAPHY MANAGER Laurier now ranked No. 9 in Canada -cover The No. 9 Golden Hawks jumped out to an early s-o lead and never looked back from there, scoring 74 by half and being up by 27 going into the third quarter. Patrick Donnelly, Connor Me-schino and Kale Harrison all had 17 points each to lead the team, de-spite the starters not playing for the fourth quarter. While the game was not very competitive, Laurier did get the op-portunity to showcase their second-ary players, something that Camp-bell appreciates and looks for. \"Guys off the bench, we just want them to control the play, eat up some minutes and avoid trouble;' said Campbell. Against RMC, the Laurier bench did more than just protect the lead, as the Hawks featured a total of six players with 15 points or more. However, with both games featuring quite decisive margins of victory, it can be hard for the team to stay focused for four quarters and stick to the hard -working style of play that coach Campbell demands, Without trying to put a damper on the team's success, Campbell did say that he looks for his star-stud-ded unit to improve once the more challenging opponents come up on the schedule. \"It's where we want to be at this point, but looking down the road, we have got to take care of busi-ness;' said Campbell who has been with the Golden Hawks since 2000. \"We aren't playing as well as we want, and we've got some big games to come where we will need more out of Harrison, Max [Allin], and hopefully get (Matt] Buckley more involved:' The Golden Hawks' next game comes on Friday when Laurentian University rolls into town.

RMC (o-4) was able to put some pressure on the Hawks, scoring more points than the home team in the third quarter and staying almost even in the second and third. How-ever, Mazerolle and Laurier's tight defence proved to be too much for the Paladin girls. \"It was a tough one to play be-cause everyone underestimates RMC;' said Mazerolle, a second-year guard. \"We came in confident, but not too confident, and adjusted to the way they were playing:' Laurier dominated the first quar-ter, scoring 16 points and only al-lowing six against. They extended their lead in the second by out-scoringthe Paladins 15-12. Chaput racked up nine points to lead the Hawks into the second half. RMC pressured the Lady Hawks in the third quarter, pulling within six points and finishing the quarter with just a ten -point spread. How-ever, the astonishing play of Doreen Bonsu proved to be too much on its own, as she became an offensive force for the Hawks. A fourth -quarter rally wrapped up the game as the Hawks dominat-ed the visiting Paladins. Mazerolle finished the match with a beauti-ful three-pointer that stunned RMC until the final buzzer. Mazerolle also claimed five rebounds and six as-sists on the day. \"My goal is to get the team going then I can get going. ( A]last minute shot like that three-pointer is kind of a lucky shot;' laughed the confi-dent point guard. \"I played it offlike I make that shot all the time:' The Hawks made a strong state-ment over the weekend, proving that they can adjust to any type of play. The team has been working well, but Mazerolle sees much room for im-provement as the season progresses. \"We are looking forward to get-ting better. We don't want to peak right now;• said the guard. \"Our goal is to just improve every game and play good defence. It all starts on defence:' Laurier defeated the Queen's Gaels on Friday, 83-60 as Saman-tha Jacobs tallied 15 points, two re-bounds and one assist. Laurier will \"Shoot for the Cure\" against the University of Laurentian Voyageurs (1-3) on Friday in the annual Breast Cancer Awareness game.

NOVEMBER 23. 2011 Hammertime: the latest weapon in the Golden Hawks' arsenal The Laurier men's hockey team has another reason to win games in the OUA this season. The player of the game from every win is awarded the \"Golden Hammer\" and the rights to carry it around school ERIC THOMPSON STAFF WRITER The Wilfrid Laurier University's men's hockey team consider them-selves a well-behaved bunch, but getting hammered now and then isn't out of the question. The team has found a new source of motivation this season, and it comes in the form of the \"Golden Hammer:' \"The Golden Hammer was my brain child, I will take full respon-sibility;' said captain Kyle Van De Bospoort. \"Although the mechanic [Ryan Daniels) was heavily involved in the fabrication. He was also the first recipient [of the award]:· \"A lot of times teams have [ mo-tivational tools], like Boston for the playoffs had that old jacket that An-drew Ference found on eBay;' added Daniels. \"Sometimes teams have a hard hat or a tool belt like we've had in the past, but we figured no one could really say they had won a gold hammer before, so we thought this would be a good idea:' The 24-Karat sledgehammer is awarded to one player after every Laurier win. \"The Hammer doesn't just go to the guy with most saves; the most goals or points;' explained Daniels. \"[It's for] if guys make big blocks on the penalty kill or pretty much doing whatever it takes to win. That's what the Hammer exem-plifies:' \"It's a good tool we brought in this year. It gives guys that extra incen-tive to work hard and give your body up for the team;' said Zack Shepley \"It's a reward that only one person gets but really at the end of the day when we get a win, it's a team win:' The hammer is given out in rec-ognition immediately following a game, but the perks don't stop there. The winner of the hammer gets ownership, and can do whatever they want with it, until someone else wins it. \"I didn't do anything too special with it, just brought it home and cel-ebrated with the boys,\" said Shepley. \"I was kind of out of commission af-ter that game for awhile, after taking a shot in the foot, so I couldn't carry around an extra hammer with me. I would love to win it again and bring it to class. It's good to bring out and get recognized:' So far this season, the Ham-mer has been awarded to Daniels (twice), Shepley and forward Tyler Stothers. After beating Western this week-end the hammer is once again in Daniels' possession. \"Winning it feels pretty nice. The hammer is pretty greasy. It's been seen around campus a couple times in class and it's taking part in our Movember campaign. It's pretty much there to just crush skulls and definitely goes outto one of the guys that's the hardest working on the ice, and one of the hardest working guys in the bar too;' Daniels joked. \"The Hammer sets a precedent for what's to be expected on and off the ice and in the locker room:' Daniels then proceeded to show off the power of the hammer, smashing a garbage can around the dressing room. The hammer may be a fearful weapon, but he explained that it has much more personality then that. \"It's like a dear friend. It has feel-ings and stuff ... I know it looks pretty hard and it might not be something you want to approach in public but it's pretty friendly... the hammer likes to be a Golden Hawk too. It bleeds purple and gold and it really believes in our program and our school:' There are more plans for the hammer moving forward, how-ever Daniels said giving it another name is not one of them. \"It's just the 'Golden Hammer: That's pretty much what it is. You can't really give it a name because it literally 'is what it is: It just does damage:' After this past week, the Laurier squad defeated the No.4 Western Mustangs 5-4 for Western's first regulation loss of the season. It was revenge for the Hawks who lost 9-3 in London previously. The hope is that the hammer will become a Laurier hockey tradition for years to come. There are also plans to engrave the name of past winners in the hammer, so that they will always be honoured. Even though the hammer hasn't been around for long, the team has rallied around the idea. The \"Golden Hammer\" has be-come the heart-of this year's hockey team. · NICK LACHANCE PHOTOGRAPHY MANAGER Ryan Daniels has won the rights to the hammer twice.
