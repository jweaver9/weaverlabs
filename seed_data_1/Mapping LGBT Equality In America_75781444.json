Unfortunately, LGBT Americans and their families face a significant barrier to achieving these goals. That barrier is a lack of equality under the law.This publication sets out to identify and explain the key gaps in legal equality for LGBT Americans by:  • Introducing the major state and local laws and policies that protect or harm LGBT people, and providing a breakdown of those laws and policies by state;  • Showing how protections for LGBT Americans vary based on sexual orientation and gender identity and expression;  • Illustrating how today’s legal and policy landscape would shift (and how it would stay the same) if the Supreme Court rules that same-sex couples have the right to marry. Thanks to the hard work of LGBT advocacy organizations across the country, local, state and federal governments are legislating protections for LGBT people at unprecedented rates. Yet progress has been slow and difficult in many states due to a combination of hostile political climates and lower levels of investment in equality within those states. Anti-LGBT activists are redoubling efforts to undermine legal protections or to bar LGBT people from further legal advances. As a result of the uneven and uncertain progress for LGBT equality, LGBT people in America face an almost incomprehensible patchwork of laws. An LGBT individual or family may have a high level of legal equality in one state, while their LGBT counterparts in a neighboring state face only hostile or negative laws. The Movement Advancement Project tracks and provides daily updates about laws and policies affecting LGBT people through our Equality Maps, found at www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps. Because of how rapidly laws are changing, this report only includes one sample state breakdown. Readers are encouraged to visit the online maps for the most up-to-date information about a particular law or a particular state. METHODOLOGYThe map on the front cover of this report shows the overall equality tally for each state and the District of Columbia. A state’s “policy tally” counts the number of positive laws and policies within the state that help drive equality for LGBT people. The major categories of laws covered by the policy tally include:1. Marriage and Relationship Recognition2. Adoption and Parenting3. Non-Discrimination4. Safe Schools5. Health and Safety6. Ability for Transgender People to Correct the Gender Marker on Identity DocumentsAcross these six categories, each positive law counts as a single point (though fractions of a point are assigned to states with positive local laws that do not cover the entire state population or to states that have enacted a portion of a law). A state’s policy tally is reduced by a point if the state has a negative law that harms or deliberately targets LGBT people. A state’s possible tally ranges from -10 to 34. Table 1 shows the cut-offs for a state having a “negative,” “low,” “medium” or “high” tally.Note that the tallies examine only at existing laws—they do not look at the social climate, nor do they take into account implementation of each state’s laws. The tally also does not reflect the efforts of advocates and/or opportunities for future change. States with low tallies might shift rapidly with an influx of resources, whereas those states with high tallies might continue to expand equality for LGBT people in ways that can provide models for other states.Table 1: Cutoffs for Each Tally RatingSexual Orientation TallyGender Identity Tally Overall TallyHigh 11 to 19 8 to 15 19 to 34Medium 4 to 10.99 3 to 7.99 7 to 18.99Low 0 to 3.99 0 to 2.99 0 to 6.99Negative -5 to -0.01 -5 to -0.01 -10 to -0.012NATIONAL OVERVIEW: STATE LGBT POLICY TALLIES ACROSS THE U.S.The infographic on the next page provides a different view of each state’s total LGBT policy tally than the map found on the front cover. State tallies run from a high of 29.25 out of 34 (California) to a low of -6.00 (Louisiana). There are 12 states and D.C. with high tallies, 10 states with medium tallies, 13 states with low tallies, and 15 states with negative tallies. States with high tallies generally offer solid protections across the six major policy areas examined in this report. States with low or negative tallies offer few or no protections. States with medium tallies often offer positive marriage and parenting laws, but fall short on safe schools, non-discrimination laws, health and safety laws, or laws and policies that help transgender people update the gender marker on their identity documents. See Appendix B for the methodology and a detailed list of all the state laws and policies examined in the policy tally.SAMPLE INDIVIDUAL STATE LGBT POLICY TALLY We use Minnesota as an example of a state policy tally, accurate at date of publication. Up-to-date policy tallies for every state can be found at www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps. The Minnesota state policy table on pages 4 through 7 provides further information on how we compiled the tallies for each state, but the remainder of this report examines summary tallies.SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY POLICY TALLIESEach state’s tally is broken into the state’s laws and policies that harm or protect based on sexual orientation and the laws and policies that harm and protect based on gender identity. In general laws covering sexual orientation affect lesbian, gay and bisexual people, while laws covering gender identity affect transgender people, although there is significant overlap. A state that has good protections on the basis of sexual orientation, but  does not have good protections on the basis of gender identity, may not receive a “high” score in the overall state policy tally. Only nine states and D.C. are categorized as “high” for both tallies, while 11 states are categorized as “negative” for both tallies. What is notable in the overall tallies is the clear lag in protections on the basis of gender identity. Twenty-four states have negative tallies for gender identity protections compared to 13 states that have negative tallies for sexual orientation protections as shown in the infographics on pages 8 and 9. The term “sexual orientation” is loosely defined as a person’s pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or more than one sex or gender. Laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation primarily protect or harm lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation.“Gender identity” is a person’s deeply-felt inner sense of being male, female, or something else or in-between. “Gender expression” refers to a person’s characteristics and behaviors such as appearance, dress, mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine, feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention “gender identity” or “gender identity and expression” primarily protect or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not adhere to gender norms and stereotypes. 3LGBT POLICY TALLIES BY STATEHIGH EQUALITY STATES12 STATES & DC, 39% OF THE LGBT POPULATIONNEGATIVE EQUALITY STATES15 STATES, 29% OF THE LGBT POPULATIONLOW EQUALITY STATES13 STATES, 23% OF THE LGBT POPULATIONMEDIUM EQUALITY STATES10 STATES, 9% OF THE LGBT POPULATIONSource: Movement Advancement Project, “LGBT Equality Maps.”HIGH POLICY TALLY MEDIUM POLICY TALLY LOW POLICY TALLY NEGATIVE POLICY TALLYKEY CA     OR     DC     VT     WA    NJ     MA     RI       CO     CT      ME      IL      NY     MN   MD    NM     DE       HI     IA      NV      WI      UT      NH     PA      FL       IN    WV     ID      AZ      NC     AK      WY     VA      MT     OK    SC      KS      TX      OH      SD     KY     ND     AR     NE     MO     MS    GA     TN      MI     AL      LA29.2528.5027.5025.2524.5024.5023.2522.0021.7521.5021.0019.2519.2518.0018.0015.5015.0013.5013.0012.7510.758.008.006.005.755.004.253.753.753.503.502.502.002.001.500.50-1.00-1.50-1.75-2.00-2.00-2.50-2.50-2.75-3.00-3.50-4.50-5.00-5.00-5.00-6.004VIEW METHODOLOGY/MORE INFORMATION Sexual Orientation Policy Tally:11.50/19HIGHGender Identity Policy Tally:6.50/15MEDIUMOverall Tally:18/34MEDIUMSee how Minnesota compares to the rest of the country on the Snapshot page.

And only 39% of LGBT people live in states with a high overall policy tally. Comparing the sexual orientation and gender identity tallies, only 28% of LGBT people live in a state with a high gender identity tally, compared to nearly half (45%) of LGBT people living in a state with a high sexual orientation tally. Overall, 55% of LGBT people live in states with a low or negative gender identity tally, compared to just 33% who live in states with a low or negative sexual orientation tally.  Same-sex couples are raising children at higher rates in states with lower policy tallies (see Figure 2). The average percentage of same-sex couples raising children across the country is 22%.

While an affirmative ruling would forever change the legal landscape for same-sex couples, such a ruling would not bring full equality to LGBT people in the United States. Many committed same-sex couples would indeed celebrate a favorable Supreme Court ruling by entering into the lifelong promise of marriage. And the legal recognition of those marriages would give LGBT parents and spouses legal security and alleviate many of the emotional and financial burdens they have faced because of unequal marriage rights. But there are many problems that nationwide marriage equality would not solve. For example, LGBT students in most states would still lack protections from bullying and harassment. Under the laws of most states, it would still be legal to unfairly fire or deny housing to LGBT people just because of who they are or who they love. Transgender people would still face unnecessary obstacles to updating their identity documents to reflect their gender. LGBT youth would still be subjected to harmful and discredited conversion therapy practices. Transgender people would still face exclusions for medically-necessary care. The list of stubbornly persistent inequalities goes on and on. In fact, some states have even passed laws deliberately taking away LGBT people’s rights, for example by trying to enshrine a right to discriminate, by creating obstacles to adoption or foster care, or by barring schools from enumerating protections for LGBT students. These laws would still stand.Shift in State Tallies if Marriage Becomes Legal NationwideThe infographics on the next four pages help illustrate what an affirmative marriage ruling would change—and what would stay the same. Although marriage for same-sex couples is only awarded one point in the tally, marriage also grants same-sex couples legal access to stepparent adoption, joint adoption, medical decision-making authority, and spousal family leave. This means a state lacking these protections would gain a net total of five points when and if marriage becomes available.Should the Supreme Court grant marriage nationwide all states would achieve full equality for “marriage and relationship recognition,” and most would see a significant improvement in their “adoption and parenting” tally. However, there would be no change in the other four major categories of law, including non-discrimination laws, safe school laws and policies, health and safety policies, and the ability of transgender people to correct the gender marker on identity documents. As shown in Figure 3 , although many states would see a positive increase in their overall tally, two states would continue to have negative tallies, 26 states would have low tallies and 10 states would have medium tallies in the wake of a Supreme Court decision affirming equal marriage rights. Figure 3 also shows that such a decision also would have no impact on state laws covering gender identity and expression. If the Supreme Court grants marriage nationwide, 90% of LGBT people will live in a state with a high or medium sexual orientation tally, but 37% will still live in a state with a negative gender identity tally.Figure 3 provides an overview of the gaps in equality that would persist even if same-sex couples could legally marry nationwide. But how do these gaps impact the lives of LGBT people? Even with marriage equality nationwide, 52% of same-sex couples would live in states that do not protect them from being unfairly fired or kicked out of their homes because they are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Fifty-seven percent of families would live in states where LGBT children are not protected from discrimination in school, and 86% of LGBT families would live in states where their children could face discrimination in school because of who their parents are. Eighty-one percent of LGBT people would live in states where harmful “conversion” therapy was still permitted. These, and some of the other many remaining challenges and inequalities, are shown in the infographic on page 12.Figure 3: Number of States at Each Equality Level Before and After Nationwide Marriage EqualityCurrentCurrentCurrentAfterAfterAfterNegativeLowMediumHigh15131012 + D.C.12 + D.C. 10 26  213024899 + D.C.9 + D.C. 9 8 2492516 + D.C.51616 + D.C.Figure 3a: Overall TallyFigure 3b: Sexual Orientation TallyFigure 3c: Gender Identity Tally12IN JUNE 2015, THOUSANDS OF LGBTPEOPLE ACROSS AMERICA COULD GAINTHE FREEDOM TO MARRY . . ....BUT IN JULY...- FIRED FROM THEIR JOBS- KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOMES- DENIED ACCESS TO DOCTOR’S   OFFICES AND RESTAURANTS52% OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD BE AT RISK OF BEING:57% PERCENT OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN STATES WHERE LGBT CHILDREN ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOL AND 86% IN STATES WHERE THEIR CHILD IS NOT PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOL FOR HAVING LGBT PARENTS. 29% OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN STATES WITHOUT PROTECTIONS FROM HATE CRIMES FOR LESBIAN, GAY, OR BISEXUAL PEOPLE.81% OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN STATES THAT PERMIT HARMFUL “CONVERSION THERAPY” FOR LGBT YOUTH.72% OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN STATES THAT CREATE BURDENSOME OBSTACLES FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE SEEKING TO CHANGE A GENDER MARKER ON A BIRTH CERTIFICATE.74% OF LGBT PEOPLE WOULD LIVE IN STATES THAT CRIMINALIZE EXPOSURE OR TRANSMISSION OF HIV.

But maps can show that we have a long way to go before we achieve true legal equality for LGBT people. Only 12 states and D.C. have high policy tallies. This would not change even if the Supreme Court were to open the freedom to marry to couples in all 50 states.LGBT people have experienced rapid progress in many areas of the country, yet this progress also has prompted negative backlashes. These range from religious exemption legislation aimed at allowing businesses to discriminate against LGBT people to state laws that strip away local control by preventing municipalities from extending non-discrimination protections to LGBT people. Adding to the challenge, some areas of the country are highly resistant to equality for LGBT people, resulting in a tougher challenges for advocates, who often also face a double-whammy of meeting greater resistance with fewer resources. This report provides an overview of the policies and laws tracked by the Movement Advancement Project. It is intended to make it easier to understand both the progress and the major remaining gaps in equality for LGBT people. Most of the figures in this report, as well as detailed policy maps by issue and by state are updated daily at www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps. This report is current as of May 28th, 2015. Readers are encouraged to go to the maps for the most up-to-date information about a particular law or a particular state.Married but Facing Legal Discrimination?Federal law does not explicitly prohibit discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and a minority of states have extended such protections to LGBT workers. In 2012, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ruled that the federal prohibition against sex discrimination includes discrimination against transgender people, though this ruling is not binding on private employers. The EEOC ruling also does not provide protections against discrimination in housing and public accommodations. Similar protections on the basis of sexual orientation are being considered but are not secure.This means that, even if the Supreme Court clears the way for same-sex couples in all 50 states to get legally married, it will still be legal in 28 states for an employer to fire a worker who married a same-sex spouse, for an apartment complex to kick out a newlywed lesbian couple, or for a restaurant manager to refuse to serve a gay couple celebrating their wedding anniversary. For a listing of states that lack non-discrimination protections, see www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws. 1718State Policy Tally Table: Current and if Supreme Court Grants Marriage

INFORMATIONKey DefinitionsLGBT: The term “LGBT” stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender and describes the community of people who are LGBT. Sexual Orientation: The term “sexual orientation” is loosely defined as a person’s pattern of romantic or sexual attraction to people of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or more than one sex or gender. Laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation primarily protect or harm lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. That said, transgender people who are lesbian, gay or bisexual can be affected by laws that explicitly mention sexual orientation.Gender Identity: “Gender identity” is a person’s deeply-felt inner sense of being male, female, or something else or in-between. “Gender expression” refers to a person’s characteristics and behaviors such as appearance, dress, mannerisms and speech patterns that can be described as masculine, feminine, or something else. Gender identity and expression are independent of sexual orientation, and transgender people may identify as heterosexual, lesbian, gay or bisexual. Laws that explicitly mention “gender identity” or “gender identity and expression” primarily protect or harm transgender people. These laws also can apply to people who are not transgender, but whose sense of gender or manner of dress does not adhere to gender stereotypes. MethodologyA state’s “policy tally” counts the number of positive laws and policies within the state that help drive equality for LGBT people. The major categories of laws covered by the policy tally include:1. Marriage and Relationship Recognition2. Adoption and Parenting Laws3. Non-Discrimination Laws4. Safe Schools Laws and Policies5. Health and Safety Policies6. Ability for Transgender People to Correct the Gender Marker on Identity DocumentsAcross these six categories, each positive law counts as a single point (though fractions of a point are assigned to states with positive local laws that do not cover the entire state population or to states that have enacted a portion of a law). A state’s policy tally is reduced by a point if the state has a negative law that harms or deliberately targets LGBT people. A state’s possible tally ranges from -10 to 34. Table 1 shows the cut-offs for a state having a “negative,” “low,” “medium” or “high” tally.Note that the tallies look only at existing laws—they do not look at the social climate, nor do they take into account implementation of each state’s laws. The tally also does not reflect the efforts of advocates and/or opportunities for future change. States with low tallies might shift rapidly with an influx of resources, whereas those states with high tallies might continue to expand equality for LGBT people in ways that can provide models for other states.Table 1: Cutoffs for Each Tally RatingSexual Orientation TallyGender Identity Tally Overall TallyHigh 11 to 19 8 to 15 19 to 34Medium 4 to 10.99 3 to 7.99 7 to 18.99Low 0 to 3.99 0 to 2.99 0 to 6.99Negative -5 to -0.01 -5 to -0.01 -10 to -0.0123Description of Laws/PoliciesMarriage for Same-Sex Couples Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueStates with the freedom to marry give same-sex couples the same marriage rights as opposite-sex couples. Some states also offer “marriage equivalent” statuses, such as domestic partnerships or civil unions, to both same- and opposite-sex couples.No legal recognition of same-sex couples.0Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from relationship recognition for same-sex couples, marriage laws do not explicitly enumerate or refer to “gender identity.” Therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.   —State recognizes legal out-of-state marriages of same-sex couples but does not allow same-sex couples to marry within the state.0.5 —Statewide access to marriage for same-sex couples.1 —Medical Decision-Making Authority for Same-Sex Couples Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueMedical decision-making policies govern whether an LGBT person can make medical decisions for their same-sex partner or spouse, if their partner or spouse is incapacitated or otherwise not able to make their own decisions. In states where same-sex couples are barred from marriage, they are usually also denied medical decision-making authority.Same-sex couples are treated as legal strangers for the purposes of medical decision-making authority.0Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from medical decision-making authority for same-sex couples, these laws have the effect of recognizing or not recognizing a same-sex partner or spouse because both parties are the same sex, not because one of the parties is transgender. Therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.—State law offers limited recognition of same-sex partners through broad language granting some medical decision-making authority to “non-family” members (for example, including “other persons” on a list of people a patient is permitted to designate as a medical decision maker).0.5 —State law explicitly gives same-sex couples equal or substantially equivalent standing to other family members such as spouses who are automatically granted medical decision-making authority.1 —Marriage and Relationship RecognitionThese laws pertain to marriage for same-sex couples and the legal recognition of the relationships of same-sex couples.24 State Family Leave Laws Covering Same-Sex Couples Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueState family leave laws covering same-sex couples govern whether an LGBT person can take leave from work to care for his/her same-sex spouse or partner. In states where same-sex couples are barred from marriage, they are usually also denied spousal or partner leave.State lacks a family leave law entirely or the existing leave law cannot be used by same-sex couples.0Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from family leave for same-sex couples, these laws have the effect of recognizing or not recognizing a same-sex partner or spouse because both parties are the same sex, not because one of the parties is transgender. Therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.—State law grants workers leave to care for a same-sex partner, but only if couple is in a legally recognized relationship.0.5 —State law grants workers leave to care for a same-sex partner, even if couple is not in a legally recognized relationship.1 —Negative Law: Ban on Marriage and/or Relationship Recognition for Same-Sex Couples Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueNegative marriage and/or relationship recognition laws restrict same-sex couples from entering into marriages, domestic partnerships, and/or civil unions—and may also prevent any legal recognition of out of state same-sex relationships or marriages.No legal ban on marriage or relationship recognition for same-sex couples.0 Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from relationship recognition for same-sex couples, marriage laws do not explicitly enumerate or refer to “gender identity.”—Constitutional amendment or statute bans marriage and/or other forms of relationship recognition similar to marriage for same-sex couples.-1 —Marriage & Relationship Recognition Subtotals (Tallies for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity) 3 — Marriage and Relationship Recognition Total 325Second-Parent And Stepparent Adoption for Same-Sex Couples Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueSecond-parent adoption laws permit a parent in a same-sex relationship to adopt his/her partner’s child and become a legal parent of that child, giving the child two legal parents and giving both parents legal rights. Stepparent adoption laws require the parents be married, while second-parent adoption laws do not.Availability is uncertain or unavailable.0 Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from second-parent adoption laws, these laws simply permit adoption of a child by a second parent who is the same-gender as the first parent. Parents are not legally banned from such adoptions because they are transgender, therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.—Parents in legally recognized same-sex relationships can petition for stepparent adoption statewide.0.5 —Parents in same-sex relationships can petition for second-parent or stepparent adoption statewide irrespective of parents’ marital status or legal recognition of their relationship.1 —Joint Adoption: Statewide Access for Same-Sex Parents Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueJoint adoption laws permit same-sex couples to adopt a child together, so both prospective parents become that child’s legal parents.Availability is uncertain. 0Although transgender people may often be (or be considered to be) in a same-sex relationship and benefit from joint adoption laws, these laws simply permit same-sex couples to jointly adopt a child. Parents are not legally banned from joint adoptions because they are transgender, therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.—Same-sex couples can petition for joint adoption statewide.1 —Adoption Non-Discrimination Protections for LGBT Parents Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueAdoption non-discrimination laws protect LGBT parents from discrimination by adoption agencies and officials.Adoption non-discrimination protections not available.0Adoption non-discrimination protections not available.0State law prohibits discrimination in adoption based on sexual orientation of parent(s).1State law prohibits discrimination in adoption based on gender identity of parent(s).1Adoption and Parenting LawsThese laws pertain to adoption, foster parenting, and other parental recognition rights for LGBT parents.26 Foster Care Non-Discrimination Protections for LGBT Parents Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueFoster care laws support or restrict LGBT people who wish to become foster parents.

Most states require the couple be married before both parents are recognized, though some states give rights to unmarried couples as long as the couple both intend to parent the child.State lacks clear mechanisms to create legal ties to both mothers for children born to same-sex couples via donor insemination.0Parents using donor insemination are not denied legal recognition because they are transgender, but because they are part of a same-sex couple. Therefore, enumerating “gender identity” is outside of the scope of these laws.—State law creates legal ties to both parents for children born to same-sex parents in a legally recognized relationship (marriage or comprehensive relationship recognition).0.5 —State law creates legal ties to both parents for children born to same-sex parents irrespective of parents’ marital status or legal recognition of their relationship.1 —Legal Recognition of De Facto Parents Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueDe facto parenting laws apply when someone is raising a child but is not a legal parent of that child. Barriers to parental recognition for same-sex couples raising children often mean that one parent is a de facto parent (an adult raising a child and acting as a parent) but not a legal parent. De Facto parenting laws provide these parents with some limited legal rights to the child, for example, possibly granting visitation, custody or even full parenting rights should the parent’s relationship dissolve.State recognition of de facto parents is uncertain or state does not recognize de facto parents.0LGBT parents’ struggles to gain legal ties to the children they are raising stems from lack of recognition of parents who are part of a same-sex couple, rather than legal denial of parenting rights because a parent is transgender.—State allows limited recognition of de facto parents as a basis for visitation and/or custody.0.5 —State recognizes de facto parents and may grant them visitation, custody or full parenting rights.1 —27State Family Leave Laws Allowing Workers to Care for Children They Are Raising Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueState family leave laws govern whether a person can take leave from work to care for a child. Barriers to parental recognition for same-sex couples raising children often mean that one parent lacks legal ties to the child or children they are raising. Parents who are not legal parents may be denied this leave unless the state recognizes parents in loco parentis.State lacks a family leave law entirely or the existing leave law cannot be used by same-sex parents.0LGBT parents’ struggles to gain legal ties to the children they are raising, and thus be recognized under state family leave laws, stem from lack of recognition of parents who are part of a same-sex couple, rather than legal denial of parenting rights because a parent is transgender.—State law grants workers leave to care for a child for whom the worker is parenting, but only if the worker has a legal or biological relationship to the child.0.5 —State law grants workers leave to care for a child for whom the worker is parenting, even if the worker lacks a legal or biological relationship to the child.1 —Negative Law: Restrictions on Adoption and/or Foster Care by Same-Sex Parents Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueSome states explicitly restrict adoption and/or foster care by same-sex parents. Other states ban adoption by unmarried couples, effectively resulting in a ban on joint adoption and/or foster care by same-sex couples if marriage for same-sex couples is not available in that state. In states where same-sex couples cannot adopt jointly, one prospective parent can file for an individual adoption, but this leaves the adopted child with only one legal parent and leaves the second parent no legal parental rights.Same-sex couples do not face legal restrictions when petitioning for adoption and/or to be foster parents.0These laws ban adoption and/or foster care by same-sex couples rather than transgender parents (or even individual parents who are lesbian, gay or bisexual).—Same-sex couples face legal restrictions when petitioning for adoption and/or to be foster parents.-1 —Adoption and Parenting Subtotals (Tallies for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity) 7 2Adoption and Parenting  Total 928Employment Non-Discrimination Laws Sexual Orientation Gender IdentityDefinition Level of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueLevel of State LawCorrespondingPoint ValueEmployment non-discrimination laws protect LGBT people from being unfairly fired, not hired, or discriminated against in the workplace by private employers.
