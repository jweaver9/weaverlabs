Abstract:  Inclusion and diversity in the workplace environments are an extremely relevant and important subject in the modern-day organization. Strong leaders are required to build a successfully operating company or organization. These workplace leaders must be trained and, be able to train others in being the most ethically inclusive people. Through methods such as personality tests, diversity training and proper mentoring, correct workplace behaviors must be rewarded, and incorrect attitudes and actions must be actively dismissed. Together, leaders and employees can build an environment that is safe, fun, productive and successful while providing equity and the inclusion of all people. Intro Today there are many reasons for corporations to be increasingly sensitive to ensure the workforce is comprised of all diverse cultures. In the past, many cultures were discriminated against, segregated to low level positions and unable to share their talents fully within the company. Due to lack of inclusion of some races and religions, companies are still facing challenges to create a workplace environment that is diverse and inclusive. This complicated task is the responsibility of quality managers to nurture a business culture that is accepting and willing to have everyone who is qualified be part of their team.  The need for inclusion of all diverse cultures and backgrounds is necessary for the modern business team, strong leaders are necessary to ensure that corporate culture strives to establish a diverse workforce. Companies strive to design their workforce to be inclusive of all people. Organizations who do not show diversity in their ranks will have a hindered ability to 1Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 20202  properly sell and market their products, along with the struggle to properly lead a team that should have multiple different cultural backgrounds involved in it. Most companies must have their workforce reflect their customers; this means that if a company is planning to market their product to all people they need to have employees from all walks of life. If this is done correctly, an organization will be able to effectively understand their target markets wants and needs which will in theory lead to high profits and a better business culture.  Although having a diverse workforce that mirrors your customer base is important, it is meaningless without strong leadership for the employees to follow. The reason many companies succeed is not because of a large network or being highly valued by an external stakeholder (McDonald 412), it is because of leadership seen in a company from the top down. The capabilities and qualifications of these leaders will provide a mission and vision for the company to analyze and follow. “There is a study of the reactions of incumbent top managers, whose responses are of particular importance, given their well-established impact on firm behavior and performance (Carpenter, Geletkanycz, & Sanders, 2004; Finkelstein, Hambrick, & Cannella, 2009).” (McDonald 406) Strong Leadership can give companies an advantage by acting as a role model for their team to follow. These leaders should reflect the organizations mission of being directly involved in the inclusion of all ethnic cultures and backgrounds. A leader who is democratic and willing to take the steps to eliminate the biases, stigmas and other stereotypes at the office will bring the best out of their multicultural team, ultimately resulting in the creation of a strong company culture. A company culture is defined straightforwardly as “the way we do things around here” (Van Hoorn 451) Company’s cultures can no longer function off one singular way of doing things and diversity will help foster that improvement. This is illustrated by some successful 2Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/613  multicultural companies who do a great job at creating an environment that is welcoming of all people. If someone is going to contribute to the team it shouldn’t matter what you look like, what you like or where you are from. Completing the job with professionalism, intuition, poise, optimism and intelligence should be the goal for managers hiring a team to complete a multidimensional task. There should never be an evaluation of a potential employee based from a bias or first impression due to any physical characteristic. Personality Tests A way that employers have been evaluating their potential employees is by using external personality tests. Personality tests are designed to break down the social characteristics of any person. These tests can be used as guidelines for employers to gage what sort of employee they want to hire and what roles they can be put in once evaluated. Studies found a stronger relationship between personality and role performance. (Janovics 79)  There are numerus personality tests that will evaluate how someone will act in life and work. These tests have become an important tool for creating a diverse team and can be utilized by anyone involved in the company’s job hiring process. There are certain people characteristics that will work well together and others who will not effectively work well together and never get anything done. The key to these tests is to break down the attitudes you will have towards different kinds of situations. The MBTI or Myers Briggs Type Indicator personality test is a great personality assessment which breaks down individual personality traits into one of 16 different personality models. (Framework 16P) There are 16 different combos of traits with a given score 0-100, with each of the four categories having two possible attributes, extraversion or introversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling and judging or perceiving. (Framework 16P) The importance of a personality test such as the MBTI is to help employees understand 3Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 20204  themselves further, either they agree or disagree with the results, but it brings awareness to the way they are perceived. The way any employee could be perceived by a team, is what a manager needs to be aware of when creating an assignment team. In certain projects, for example, it could be more important to have more extraverts than introverts if the project involved having more contact with new clients or partners. There are also people who should be assigned to different roles in the company based off their strengths and weaknesses indicated in their individual personality assessment. For example, not everyone is the best fit to be in a management level position where there will be a lot of contact with many different personalities and cultural demographics from your own, but they could be more suitable to be in a management role where they only oversee a certain operation of the company. (Alexander 162) Either way, an assessment that measures your personality on a scale is an important tool for any company who wants to create a work place environment that is diverse. Sometimes there can be an interviewer bias for someone who is looking for candidates with traits similar to their own. This is not something that is desirable for a company who requires a diverse amount of experience and perspectives. As the growing concerns of social standards have become much more present in the recent years it has also spread awareness into the corporate work place. For example, Fortune 500’s 2018 CEO list indicates, that out of 500 companies, there are only 24 females and 3 African American CEOs. The statistics show that 7 out of 10 senior executives in these Fortune 500 companies are white males. (Fortune) These numbers clearly do not reflect the population of the employees at every company, proving that there is not equal representation among ethnic demographics in company leadership. When this happens in companies there becomes a pattern in who is selected for promotions and it tends to be people with similar attributes, most of the 4Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/615  time physical characteristics and personality traits. The creation of the team or group should always take place within a specific context or “ecosystem” in mind by the team leader. (Hernandez 15) Interrelationships between employee traits need to be considered in order to provide a comprehensive characterization of organizations employee culture. (Van Hoorn 453) To be inclusive you must be willing to hire people from different cultures and perspectives, or else the progression of your company will ultimately slow, if not, come to a halt. With that being said, personality and attitude play a factor in the formation of teams inside an organization, to ensure that all employees are aware of the appropriate behavior inside a team that is diverse you need to provide them with the appropriate training.  Diversity Training Diversity training is another crucial tool to help companies establish a diverse workforce and help ensure that their leadership teams are inclusive. Diversity training can be conducted by anyone with the proper training, but it is important to understand the purpose behind the exercises and what liabilities could potentially be exposed as a result of the training outcome. The integration of these diversity programs can make a huge difference in the company’s ability to create an inclusive work environment.  These diversity training programs can make a difference in two timeframes of an employee’s lifecycle with a company, first when they are reviewed for consideration to be hired. This kind of training or evolution wouldn’t occur for any first round candidate but could be the difference between someone getting the job or not in the final stages of the interview process. To begin, the interviewer would bring a group of potential employees and current employees together to a table. The facilitator would then ask a series of questions laying out a real life scenario where the group would then be told to have a discussion on the matter. An important 5Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 20206  purpose of these exercises is not only to evaluate how an employee would act during a team setting but also to see what kind of person they will be in your office place. (Millar) This gives a chance for different people within an organization to also make an influence on the decision-making process of hiring an employee because they get to involve a second opinion. The point of diversity training programs is to give awareness to everyone, by conducting these training sessions as part of the hiring process you are having multiple employees participating in a diversity activity making it no longer a singular appointed person making the decision to hire a potential employee. Employees are obligated to ensure that their work place environment is discrimination free. (Lattal 412) This allows for multiple ideas to be involved with the hiring process while still getting to understand how a candidate will show their usual tendencies and eliminate those with strong biases that could be hurtful to the company. (Wheeler 327) The second instance a diversity training program would be critical is in an employee’s career is if there is ever a complaint against him or her. Studies show that 80% our western population intends to benign intercultural relations. (Wheeler 327) This proves that inherently most people are morally good. As for the 20% of the working population, diversity training could help them understand their potential subtle biases that offend some of their coworkers.  Why Inclusiveness To create an inclusive work environment and set the framework for a stable, safe, culturally diverse environment that is inclusive to all it must go beyond a few members acting out of kindness and sincerity. To achieve this, it must be an organizational goal to eliminate biases and stigmas. Unfortunately, there are still people in the world who will have all kinds of 6Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/617  biases that create awkward interactions, unchecked assumptions, stereotypical judgements and inferred diversity racism. (Wheeler 327) These people are undesirable in organizations who are striving to create a work place environment that is culturally diverse and inclusive. Individuals who display demographic racism, stigmas and biases towards any group or individual, must be terminated from an organization promptly. Often there are companies that have bad reputations for their treatment of minorities and people of different cultural backgrounds. Treatment is directly tied into the relationship and morality that the superior has. If an employee has poor treatment it could affect them greatly, not just at a business scale but at a physiological one. There are many ways that an employee could be treated poorly in a workplace that some may deem acceptable to an untrained manager in diversity and personality training such as, increasing workload, increasing quotas, lack of significant role in the workplace, removal from team settings and removal from workplace subcultural activities. For many instances, employees will be treated in a discriminatory matter that is completely unacceptable for anyone to witness, take part in, or be affected by. This can be anything from bullying in the workplace which would be exemplified by name calling or slander. Another example could be unequal treatment to the employee either by a lower salary, less chance for overtime, not being considered for promotion when the time comes, and many more. These discriminatory issues are seen to affect women, women of color, cultural minorities and those who have English as a second language the most. Clearly this leaves a population of privileged men who have had similar personalities and qualities as the superiors before them in line for the next job or promotion. The hope is that an organization must accomplish a greater push for diversity inclusion within their ranks. This will hopefully change a whole organizations 7Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 20208  culture because there will be mentors and networks for all individuals to turn to, giving opportunity for idea sharing, growth within the company and beyond. Biases The involvement of managers in the detection of sociocultural biases inside an organization is absolutely the key in determining if someone is to be considered a problematic individual. Having a manager highlight these individuals takes time and effort because these outliers might not be discriminating in front of your eyes. This is where investigations must come into play, if a reasonably informed bystander looking at the situation can reasonably perceive one or more biases while assessing the person in question then there needs to be action taken. (Lattel 420) A challenge is how individuals might have sub-conscious biases about people in an organization, a manager will have to be able to pinpoint if this behavior is indictive of exclusion and hate with malicious intent or not. (Gills 209) Having to make the judgements on a situation can be extremely tough because a majority of the time the team members involved are all crucial components to an organization. The complexity of each situation is individual, the answer is not always clear cut, so the best way to avoid these biases and stigmas is to make sure that there is proper training and workshops. These training sessions need to be cohesive, clear and done early on or even before the hiring process in a company. This is one of the only prevention methods that a company and a manager could use to potentially pick out the bad players before they are able to do damage to the culture of an organization.  Eliminating biases can be accomplished by multiple different strategies that add together to create a full scope of awareness and willingness to provide their cooperation. To start, companies must internally analyze themselves to understand the demographics and socio-culturally environment they presently have. The demographics of the company could be anything 8Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/619  that measures differences, for example: gender, age, ethnic background, employment status in the company while also measuring the sociocultural aspect which would include anything from traditions, tastes, lifestyles, values, and beliefs. These combine to give you a visible understanding of your employee’s background and position. Involvement from the senior management board would then need to discuss the discoveries. A determination would be made to understand if it is necessary to implement potential solutions to become more diverse and inclusive. Many organizations will use this information by sharing that knowledge with managers at every level. They will be the ones responsible to begin the strategic planning to make a change in the workplace environment.  Stigmas Stigmas in the workplace are also a common reason for employee misconduct. Stigmas are defined as an undeserving label given to a person or group of people. (Villoti 125) Work is a major factor in social inclusion and is a central recovery for a person’s mental wellbeing. (Villoti 126) The perceptions of work are clearly negative if you go to your office or work site and find that you are being discriminated against for a certain stigma surrounding you. These stigmas could be based off of prior experiences with people similar to yourself and could be a major lapse in judgement for those against you. This can be seen in multiple different areas in an employee’s career starting from an application process. An example of this is, a potential employee is applying for a job that requires a lot of discipline and focus, the applicant has on their resume that he or she was involved in Greek life as a part of their college experience. Now that person who was reading over the application could have a prior poor experience with someone who was part of Greek life but now identifies all people in Greek life as lazy and unmotivated. This is just one example of a group being labeled as what someone’s opinion 9Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 202010  deems them as. Sadly, this is something that happens all too often to people undeserving of harsh stigmas that individualize them from the rest of their coworkers. People with disabilities are seen as outliers in most workplace communities, coworkers judging them on preconceived stigmas that they must be intolerably different from them. This can be detrimental to that person’s wellbeing because of a significant lack of social support. (Villoti 130) Corporations can help eliminate these stigmas by working on motivation and support from their superiors and peers, there could be a huge lack in individual support and attention to stigmatized workers by their current managers. Having a perception that no one recognizes your work in an organization is truly disheartening and can lead to extreme productivity loss, this could cause them to be terminated or scolded by their superior managers. That will not solve the issues for them because of the known discrimination against them, they simply do not feel welcomed in that workplace.  There is also the chance for employees of different cultures who are part of an organization to have fears especially if they are not exposed to Western culture. These team members could be seen as having avoiding behavior and at best this will cause seclusion but also feelings of being disliked, unwelcomed and discriminated against. (Wheeler 330) A manager who is trained to be perceptive to these people can help inclusion in a team by going out of his or her way to make these people confident and include them in social interactions with the rest of the team to create a more dynamic workplace environment that allows for deeper connections in the office place. A good manager can recognize a stigmatized individual and help them to understand that the company does not perceive them as just another number. An even greater manager would take it a step further and not only show them that they are a respected and a needed member of the organization but, they would involve them on special committees and projects where their 10Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/6111  different perceptive is not only needed but aspired for. This is just a few ways you can involve these stigmatized groups or persons into a workplace setting more frequently.  Research on Bias and Stigma The study of biases and stigmas have become increasingly more popular. (Lattal 414) The studies that are conducted help us to understand why these individuals have certain predetermined opinions of people, places or activities. It is stated that in studies conducted to understand biases that there were clear biases against the interviewers facilitating. (Miyazaki 780) In these interviews there was a noticeable bias towards gender and cultural representation of the interviewers themselves. (Miyazaki 780) An interview bias can be caused by several factors, some that are based off of the initial greetings between the interviewer and those in the study. A result suggests that those researchers who greeted their subjects with a warm friendly greeting were seen to have less answers that broadcasted interviewer bias, conversely, those who showed little interest to their subjects and were not friendly were given answers that showed much higher levels of biases. (Miyazaki 781) This is called interaction bias which happens every day. The simple social cues given off during any interaction between two people will describe the biases that one will make assumptions about throughout the conversation and beyond in their judgement of you as a person. Although these may not be true at all, they are the initial opinions of the people you meet.  The studies break down the individual biases that have certain effects on discrimination in the workforce. They touch upon the bias of how people view gender, age, and race as the three main highlighted segmentations. Each of these groups can be seen in one individual so there becomes a question of, “When investigating the potential biasing effects of researcher psychological characteristics, the difficulty often lies not only in detecting problematic individual 11Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 202012  or group characteristics, but also in determining how best to eliminate or explain any biases that are found.” (Miyazaki 782) An organization can help use these studies to help implement programs and train their leadership to eliminate the biases and stigmas found in their company’s workforce. Technology Involvement With the help of computer administration technologies, it has become increasingly easier to understand and eliminate workplace biases and stigmas. Moving data collection of any controlling factor is a reliable and successful way to receive behaviorally feedback. (Miyazaki 790) The involvement of these programs has aided in managers having a vision on how to handle any potential exclusion issue. The programs can maintain and breakdown this big data thus allowing for a manager of a company to understand an entire office worth of employees without having to assess everyone. The combining of data on employees’ personal traits with data on their work outcomes can help a manager assess performance by character traits. (Van Hoorn 454) This can help to tackle issues with personal biases and stigmas against any particular segment of people in a workplace. These programs are anything from survey analysis, facilitating pretesting, diversity training and AI personal data collection. With the assistance of these computer run programs and data sets, a good manager can find the outliers in an organization separated by multiple categories such as department, age, gender, position, rank and any other physical traits to track a number of measurable variables. Leadership Development The plan is to develop focused individuals to become the moral standard for a workplace setting. It is widely recognized that an individual’s role in an organization’s environment is an 12Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/6113  essential factor on employee’s behavior at the workplace. (Van Hoorn 451) Thus they will become the role models for the people around them, not only in a teamwork place setting but, as also being an example in how to act within a company’s subculture. Role models for the team members are key for a full understanding of what is expected of them and what appropriate workplace behavior is. The Subculture of any organization is a large variable within the strategy of inclusion in a company. A subculture is described as a culture within a given culture often not following the same core values of the dominate culture, normally very exclusive to others who are not affiliated. (Study) During life everyone sees that there are different friend groups and cliques because of certain qualities. This can be anything from geographical background or common interests commonly with no malicious intent behind their forming. These subcultures can play a huge role in how employees feel towards a company because if they are not inside the group, they might feel they have lost social interaction within the company. These toxic subcultures effect numerus industries but seem to have a high correlation with business. Due to these underlying cultures still being present, workers who feel that they do not fit in, also feel that they do not fit into the corporation totally, thus driving down productivity and commitment.  The development of good leaders who have a defining role in the organization, that understands the physiological effects that these subcultures can put onto certain members of a team and make sure to include them in everything. This can be as simple as asking someone to sit with you during a lunch break or organizing team activities to be more open for social interactions with the team. Although many cultures would be seen as causal and unharmful, some could be malicious in a sense where they take it opinion themselves to segregate their peers out from situations. By having people like this in an organization it is hard to make it a welcoming, inclusive environment for ethnic cultures and backgrounds, although if you have a 13Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 202014  unapparelled leader who is willing to be vocal and oppose these bad behaviors, then a culture shift could proceed. If these few undesirable employees are found to have the stigmas and biases unwanted in the organization, management must do what’s best for the company’s best interests “…our findings suggest that such characteristics are a relatively strong determinant of organizational identification.” (McDonald 407) They will either be terminated due to behavior or this management staff will awaken them through methods of training to bring awareness to them about their wrong doings. This cannot simply be a video session training though, the training must be hands on where you can clearly demonstrate the undesirable acts to them, so they are completely aware what is just and unjust. With this and predeveloped moral leaders a company can combat the complex subcultures within an organization to ensure a safe and prosperous environment.  After reviewing all of the potential challenges a manager will face while trying to create a culturally diverse and inclusive workplace, now the description of a proper manager will not be eluded from this report. A great manager is more than a natural born leader, they are morally respected for their character and judgement. (Gills 213) Demographic difference make it very difficult to treat everyone the same, although everyone should be treated with respectful leadership. Often it is also seen that mentoring can be stimulating for the mentor as well, affecting their overall work experience, allowing for respectful and mutual relationships to form. (Scardillo 5) A respectful mentor will have a direct correlation with their employees work effort and productivity, they also will foster a more inclusive environment by being a good example for all to follow. (Gills 213) An interpersonal manager who shows interest in not only people’s ideas but, their opinions will have an effect on each of their employees and their personal self-esteem. This can help resolve any issues with poor employee indicators, showing those who are willing 14Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/6115  to put time and effort into an organization that they are not only cared about but that they have a sense of belongingness. (Gills 214) The ability for a manager to articulate to their team that they are a “Nontraditional” leader is important because of the known stigmas about cruel and common bosses.  Many would consider the typical stereotypical qualities of a manager to be, negative, cruel, overly critical, unwilling to participate and egotistical. This would be the considered traits of a traditional manager whose role in the organization is less of a leader and more of a boss directing with no sense of motivation besides fear. This will lead to an unhealthy relationship between employee and manager who creates an environment much like a cesspool. (Scardillo 1) To lead with integrity, enthusiasm and encouragement a leader will demonstrate the goodness in their heart to welcome everyone on their team to become a successful role player and usher in a sense of family to the whole department or organization. The role of these moral leaders who are nontraditional in their strategic management practices are imperative in the modern business world and demographics continue to change they are the key to having a work setting that is culturally inclusive and diverse.  Conclusion So, as it can be discussed and concluded, a manager has a large amount of work as they pursue creating a workplace environment that is culturally inclusive and diverse. They can do this by training employees before and after employment. This will clear up any discrepancies between what is perceived to be correct behavior and is not. Included in these training methods are interactive computer programed activities that incorporate the information that is crucial for the training sessions to get across. This helps managers identify those individuals who have high levels of biases and stigmas towards any culture or ethnic background. These applications allow us to further understand an offices subculture, which has historically had a large amount of 15Tillinghast: The Need for Inclusion of All Diverse Cultures and Backgrounds isPublished by DigitalCommons@SHU, 202016  discrimination and segmentation towards certain groups or demographic backgrounds. (Study) With these tools, managers can do a better job with their team relations and create a setting that encourages teamwork, creativity and joy. The goal of any company is clearly to succeed, having a workplace that is free of biases and stigmas will bring less friction in the workflow, which in theory turns to higher profitability and staff satisfaction. (Alexander 170) In the end this falls on the shoulders of a quality manager to be a great mentor to their team and be a leader for each employee to look up to. If these factors are included, it will become a workplace environment that is sought after and we find that the company as a whole will have more respect, less conflict and a better chance to be a company that survives. As you can see, a manager’s role in the acceptance of cultural inclusion and diversity by eliminating workplace cultural biases and stigmas will create an environment that is welcoming to all people no matter their ethnical background or diverse lifestyle.          16Academic Festival, Event 61 [2020]https://digitalcommons.sacredheart.edu/acadfest/2020/all/6117   Citations: Villotti, Patrizia, et al. “Reducing Perceived Stigma: Work Integration of People with Severe Mental Disorders in Italian Social Enterprise.” Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal, vol. 41, no. 2, June 2018, pp. 125–134.

    "abstract": "Inclusion and diversity in the workplace environments are an extremely relevant and important subject in the modern-day organization. Strong leaders are required to build a successfully operating company or organization. These workplace leaders must be trained and, be able to train others in being the most ethically inclusive people. Through methods such as personality tests, diversity training and proper mentoring, correct workplace behaviors must be rewarded, and incorrect attitudes and actions must be actively dismissed. Together, leaders and employees can build an environment that is safe, fun, productive and successful while providing equity and the inclusion of all people",
