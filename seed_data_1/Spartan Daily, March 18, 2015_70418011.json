Ward said the team is a collaboration between public and university library staff  to foster team building and commu-nity between the two groups.“Th ere was a wide staff  involvement, which was really great,” Ward said.When Ward approached Willis about the drill team last Fall, Willis said, “Yep, I’m there.”According to an article in the New York Times, book cart drill teams were popularized in the mid-2000s by Demco, a book cart manufacturer who sponsored the world championship competition at the American Library Association’s an-nual conference for several years.Th e team’s inaugural performance was in December.It performed a holiday-themed piece, featuring carts decorated like gingerbread Book cart drill team takes over King LibraryBY THE BOOKVisit spartandaily.com for video coverageLoan burden weighs down studentsBY RIGOBERTO GOMES@AskRigoMany students are preparing to graduate this semester and they have to deal with student loan debt and the process of re-paying the loans they borrowed.Every year some college stu-dents are forced to break the bank for tuition, books, rent, food and weekend activities.“College-age millennials (ages 18-25) surveyed across the country believe they will be ‘better off ’ or ‘the same’ as their parents,” states a recent Bank of America/USA TODAY Better Money Habits Millennial report. “While two-thirds say they have good fi nancial habits, large numbers still worry about the cost of student loans/col-lege education (33 percent) and spending beyond their means (36 percent).”Th e average amount of col-lege loan debt is $29,526 for graduate students and $17,629 for undergraduate students.Th ere are college loans that do build interest throughout students’ college careers, which can be more diffi  cult for recent graduates to pay off .San Jose State University of-fers the Federal Perkins Loan, which off ers low-interest loans to undergraduate and gradu-ate students to meet the cost of education.Th e repayment of the loan begins six months aft er a stu-dent has graduated or leaves school, and there is no payment while the undergraduate is in school.“I’ve taken out student loans that I eventually have to pay back and I think it’s going to be hard at fi rst because it’s not guaranteed you’re going to fi nd a good paying job aft er gradu-ation,” said Isela Rodriguez, se-nior psychology major.FINANCIAL WOESSEE LOAN ON PAGE 2CRUDE REALITYBY JEREMY CUMMINGS@JeremyCummings3Despite growing public oppo-sition to transportation of crude oil by rail since serious accidents such as the Lac-Megantic crash in 2013 a proposal to the Santa Ma-ria Planning Commission might bring a crude oil train directly through Downtown San Jose.Jill and Jack Sardegna, two concerned San Jose natives who live close to the train tracks, worry about pollution and other risks the trains could bring.“We didn’t think that this was a possibility here, and certainly not through a residential area,” Jill Sardegna said, “But here it is.”San Jose State is in the po-tential impact zone of fi res that could result from a derailment downtown, according to blast-zone.org, but the school’s ad-ministration is unprepared at this point to respond to such an event, according to SJSU Chief of Staff  Stacy Gleixner at a press conference with student media last Wednesday.“I don’t think we’ve given thought yet to what kind of pre-cautions we might need to have in place,” Gleixner said.Th e train, run by Union Pacif-ic Railroad, will carry oil to the Phillips 66 refi nery in San Luis Obispo County and was pro-posed in 2013.According to a draft  of the proposal’s environmental impact report on slocounty.ca.gov, up to fi ve 80-car trains will run to the Mesa refi nery a week.Th e commission has the fi -nal say on whether or not the oil trains will run, a decision which will impact some citizens’ lives all throughout California, according to Council member Ash Kalra.Safety risks of oil trainsComplete safety cannot be guaranteed when transporting oil by rail, according to Francisco J. Castillo, director of corporate relations and media at Union Pa-cifi c Railroad.Castillo said although oil by rail arrives safely 99.99 percent of the time, there is a risk associat-ed with this shipping method as there is with any other.In July 2013 an oil train de-railed in Lac-Megantic, Que-bec, Canada, killing 47 and causing significant damage to the city.Trains will bring oil through Downtown San JoseSan Jose’s Bowling BrosBY ARNO BRYANT@MrArnoBryantSibling rivalry has a long his-tory of breeding sporting success.

Instructors will help students combine art and technology into a tangible fi nal product.“We have to teach girls that tech-nology can offer them a lot and it’s not very hard to use—they’re using it all the time,” Goss said. “We want to teach them to put it together as a work of art that they can be really proud of.”Goss has a bachelor’s degree in En-glish and she received a Master of Fine Arts in poetry and nonfiction from SJSU in 2007.“Poetry deals a lot with images; it’s very rich, sensory language so it kind of makes sense to add to the poetry by cre-ating a short fi lm,” Goss said. “Th ere’s kind of a growing subculture of people who are more and more familiar with how easy and fun it is to make these. You get addicted to them.”Goss said Perez had the idea to make the camp specifi cally for teenage girls because women and girls are not equal-ly represented in technology fi elds. She said the camp combines poetry and video because the two formats be-long together.“From a fi lmmaking standpoint—I’m a scriptwriter and I make fi lms—I think that’s just a really innovative outlet for artists and people who are interested in poetry and multimedia technology,” said Lauren Serpa, a graduate student in creative writing. “I think that would be an innovative thing for teenage girls.”Perez said studies have shown when women reach a certain age, many tend to shy away from technology and oft en gravitate toward the arts and poetry. He said it seems to have a lasting eff ect.“We’re hoping that projects like ours—like Media Poetry Studio—will put technology back in their hands … give them access to a technology in a context that will be interesting to them,” Perez said.In terms of tuition, Goss said the program is “pretty reasonable,” costing $799 for two weeks.Th e three poet laureates started planning the camp last spring.“We had to secure funding, we had to write grants, we had to come up with curriculum—which we’re still working on—we had to fi nd a place to do it and a fi scal sponsor since we’re not a non-profi t,” Goss said. “Th ere’s lots of work and we’ll be doing it right up until the day it starts.”Goss said they want to be able to give each student individualized attention so there is room for about 20 young women.“Our culture allows men to have their voices and tells girls that they need to listen,” Goss said. “I’m not saying that we won’t ever do a camp with girls and boys, but this one we wanted to do just for girls.”Taylor Atkinson is a Spartan Daily staff writer.Summer camp gives females a creative voice houses set to a techno remix of “Winter Wonderland.”“We had so much fun that we decided to do a St. Patrick’s Day performance,” Ward said.The performance was choreographed to an Irish step dance song titled “Danc-ing Over the Rainbow.”“When choosing the music, I was look-ing for something that I wouldn’t get tired of listening to over and over,” Ward said.Th e choreography included forma-tions, jumps and turns with the carts in a style that refl ects Ward’s background in line dancing.“Th is is a really fun piece to work with because there are so many transitions, and so we defi nitely choreographed with the transitions in mind,” Ward said.Th e team had plans to compete in the regional book cart team competition at the American Library Association confer-ence in Los Angeles, according to Ward.“Instead, we found that they don’t do that anymore, so we decided to just do it for the students and the patrons and the staff ,” Ward said.Th e team hopes to keep performing in the future.

A conductor failed to set the train’s brakes correctly, al-lowing it to run out of con-trol into the town center.Data from a report re-leased by environmental watchdog Mesa Refi nery Watch Group shows that ap-proximately 462,000 gallons of crude oil are confi rmed to have spilled in the United States alone since 2013.Unconfi rmed amounts of oil have been spilled in other derailments such as one that occurred in Alicev-ille, Alabama, in December 2013.Th e most commonly used tank car by the De-partment of Transportation is the DOT-111.According to data from dot111.org and 2014 North American Freight Railcar re-view, DOT-111s make up ap-proximately 75 percent of the North American Rail Fleet.Th ese tank cars are a big concern to environmental groups such as the Mesa Refi nery Watch Group, which say DOT-111s follow outdated safety standards and leak large quantities of hazardous materials during transit.Carol Ziegler, a represen-tative of Phillips 66, said all of the cars in its fl eet meet the newest safety standards for oil transportation.Local ImpactLast Wednesday a Union Pacifi c train pulling emp-ty gravel cars derailed near Taylor and Seventh streets in Japantown. Th ere were no injuries, but stalled traffi  c forced public transit to reroute, ac-cording to a report by NBC Bay Area.Th e Lac-Megantic ac-cident shows the potential consequences of an oil train derailing in a populated area.According to San Jose Fire Department Chief Cur-tis Jacobsen, San Jose Fire is not equipped to contain the fi res that could result from a derailment.Th e Sardegnas are wor-ried by the lack of publi-cized information about this issue, and have contact-ed multiple news outlets in-cluding the Mercury News trying to get the word out.“Th is is a big concern for us that students don’t even know this is happening,” Jill Sardegna said.Councilmember Kalra said it’s important for SJSU students to educate them-selves about this and other issues so they might make a diff erence going into the future.Jeremy Cummings is a Spartan Daily staff writer.OILFROM PAGE 1There are occasions when a student might not be able to repay their loan for certain reasons and the Bursar’s Office tries to assist.“We work with stu-dents with regards to repayment options, es-pecially if they indicate that they are having dif-ficulty in repaying this loan,” said SJSU Bursar Meg Deiss in an email. “There are several types of deferments for which students may be eligible and we assist by counsel-ing and assisting students to complete the necessary paperwork.”Students also have the option to avoid student loans by considering a part-time job around San Jose.A part-time job can assist students financial-ly and can develop better working habits and skills.Another option is fed-eral work study jobs for eligible students depend-ing on their financial aid package.A part-time job will allow students to be-come more aware of their spending habits and cre-ate a budget plan toward their expenses.“We recommend to look into scholarship op-portunities as an addi-tional funding source,” said Coleetta McElroy, di-rector of financial aid and scholarship office, in an email. “Applications may take time to complete but the rewards of receiving non-repayable monies to help towards educational costs is enormous.”Kristin Putnam, senior business major, ref lected on her major and future career which she believes can possibly get her out of loan debt.“I think I have a se-cured major that will land me a job as soon as I grad-uate and which will make it easier for me to pay off these loans I ranked up throughout these four years,” Putnam said.The length of time it takes to repay student loans is different for every college student.“For a standard repay-ment plan, this is gener-ally 10 years if a borrower chooses to change their repayment plan,” McElroy said. McElroy said the re-payment plan varies based on the amount of debt and the plan chosen. “The federal govern-ment does grant addi-tional time (forbearance), which keeps the loan in good standing while de-laying repayment if the student is unable to secure immediate employment, or is underemployed,” McElroy said.Rigoberto Gomes is a Spartan Daily staff writer.LOANFROM PAGE 1NEWS 2 Wednesday, March 18, 2015BY KEENAN FRY@Keenan_J_FryOli Herbert, lead guitarist for metal band All Th at Remains, opens the gate to the upper fl oor of Th e Catalyst. I follow his lean frame upstairs, which barely clears the doorframe to the upper lounge. Herbert is tall as palm tree, with long tuff s of branch-ing brown hair drapping from his head.We sit on the soft  pleather couch, I click the tape recorder on, and Herbert drops 30 minutes on the tap. I feel like a recording engineer trying to edit a Grateful Dead jam into a compre-hensive song. Everything Herbert gave me was legendary advice. What makes Herbert an exceptional member of the metal community goes beyond his status as a guitar virtuoso.I was honnored by Herbert’s humility.He’s a really approachable person who works to reach out to his fans. He stood by the merch table aft er All Th at Remains end-ed their set, chillin’ out, taking photos with the fans. All Th at Remains is a ‘working man’s’ band, they came across the country from Massachusetts just for their fans.Th e only reason I have anything to write today is because I asked him on the spot for an exclusive interview, which he granted on the spot. A true testament to his character as a master and teacher.My impression of him was only rein-forced by the in-depth interview he gave me. As a guitarist myself, I tried to dive more into what drove him to become the musician he is today.Herbert began to listen to heavy metal in the ‘80s when one of his friends intro-duced him to Motley Crue.“I listened to a lot of radio pop stuff  in the ‘80s (like) REM … I didn’t know any better, then I met this friend when I lived in the Springfi eld area (he asked) ‘Hey man, you like metal?’ I’m like ‘Well it’s loud and noisy’ (he said) well listen to this and he put on Motley Crue’s ‘Shout at the Devil’ and I was like ‘Woah’ and I instantly liked it.”Th e album acted as a gateway to more metal bands as Herbert began to deeply identify with the message of independance within metal music. His interest in hair metal quickly devolved deeper ties.“Th e hair metal stuff  led me to the real metal,” Herbert said, “Metallica, Slayer, Megadeath (and Anthrax) you know, ‘the Big Four.’”Regardless if you’re a metalhead or a guitarist, Herbert’s words carry the weight of understanding.“Practice better, play better” is an un-derlying theme to everything Herbert said.Herbert is a master of disciplined cre-ativity, and the guitar is simply his means of expressing his creativity.Herbert has been the lead guitarist for All Th at Remains since 1999. His relation-ship with the band and metal, as a genre, has remained steady through the years.“I still feel like it is, like being in a family. You see people come and its like I’m not any diff erent from the kids that come to see this stuff , you know, I’ve just been doing it for awhile,” Herbert said.Herbert is still inspired by metal and music in general, even as a virtuoso gui-tarist he still has the greater aspiration to become a composer for fi lm scores.“It’s easy to get jaded if you’re around one kind of music all the time,” Herbert said. “ … I still really enjoy the kind of music I play … metal’s still, I still feel it in my heart … when I perform it’s giving to myself and it’s something very true to myself, it makes me happy,” Herbert said.Th e diversity in Herbert’s musical inter-ests shows the depth of his creativity. He’s a master of his craft  that anyone can respect for his level of accomplished discipline.Keenan Fry is the Spartan Daily arts and entertainment editor.By Duy Nguyen@duynguynvn94“Cinderella” was released last week-end in 31 countries and was a highly anticipated movie which attracted chil-dren and adults. According to Deadline, it brought the Walt Disney Co. $67.8 million during its opening weekend. Th e fi lm’s estimated budget was 95 million dollars according to IMDb.com. James Brown, a box offi  ce worker from Century 20, said he could not count how many tickets were sold during the fi rst days of the “Cinderella” release.Advertising for the fi lm began last year. Th e critical question was that artists, directors and fashion designers would be trusted to translate this archetypical story from animation to live actors.Th e role of Cinderella was given to Lily James, a young actress who gained notoriety in “Downton Abbey,” a pop-ular television show which won several Emmy awards.Cate Blanchett, two-time Acade-my Award-winning actress, was cast as Lady Tremaine, better known as the evil stepmother. Blanchett was fi rst recog-nized by the Academy in 2004, winning best actress in a supporting role for “Th e Aviator” and again in 2013 for best ac-tress in a leading role for “Blue Jasmine.”“Cinderella” had many factors which could have produced a quality fi lm but the biggest challenge was how to get away from the original cartoon, which is fa-mous to children from across the world.At Westfi eld Oakridge Mall, before the 7:45 p.m. screening of “Cinderella,” some children shared their excitement watching the movie.“Th e Cinderella cartoon brings me to here,” Ryan Hoang, 14, said. “Even though I’m a boy, I’m obsessed with the cartoon and I’m excited to check the movie out.”Katherine Hoang, 12, said, “I want to be a princess. Th at’s why I’m here today. I want to see how the prince is.”However, when evaluating the fi lm for its ability to re-envision the story, “Cinderella” was a total failure. Espe-cially when compared and contrasted to the live action “Malefi cent,” which was a relaunch of 1959’s “Sleeping Beauty.”Th e new “Cinderella” movie was not brave enough to change the plot. I would estimate 85 percent was copied and past-ed from the cartoon, making it “safe” but not “surprising and interesting.” Small changes were made, yet they were pointless because they did not make any diff erence to the story as the whole.Cinderella’s parents were briefl y in-troduced at the beginning of the Mov-ie. Before her mother died she said, “Be brave and be courageous.”However, all of the audience knew that Cinderella was kind, courageous and well-educated by her parents. Th us those extra details were not necessary and did not improve the fi lm.At the end, the stepmother broke Cinderella’s glass slipper to prevent her from meeting the prince, but Cinderella still got married to the prince. So that scene is also meaningless.In “Malefi cent,” the fi lm was brave to explain Malefi cent’s cruelty with a developed story, instead of reverting to the original “bad from birth” story. Th e movie even made Malefi cent the one who helped princess Aurora wake from a curse by giving Aurora a kiss on her cheek, which was not from the prince.“Malefi cent” was successful because it rewrote “Sleeping Beauty” while prov-ing the statement that, don’t judge any-one without knowing their challenges.“Cinderella” further disappoints au-diences by introducing less than fi ve new songs, to my count, and they are not the best movie soundtracks from the Disney company.Although “Cinderella” is not the best, “Beauty and the Beast” with English ac-tress Emma Watson comes out next year and is expected to be better.Duy Nguyen is a Spartan Daily staff writer.gives interview at Th e CatalystKeenan Fry | Spartan DailySinger Philip Labonte, left, and lead guitarist Oli Herbert, right, are the only remaining founding members of All That Remains, founded in 1998.FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM@SPARTANDAILYTh umbs down for new ‘Cinderella’Guitarist Oli HerbertREVIEWVisit spartandaily.com for video coverageA&E 3Wednesday, March 18, 2015In the fi ght for equality, invisibility is one of the most important hurdles facing the bisexual community.Oregon Governor Kate Brown’s election is a hallmark moment for bisexual visibility. She became the fi rst openly bisexual gover-nor when she took offi  ce in February, and is a role model for young people who struggle with a lack of visibility and positive repre-sentation in media.Th e Bisexual Resource Center partnered with the Human Rights Campaign last year to release a report titled “Supporting and Caring for Bisexual Youth.”Th e report details the specifi c challeng-es that bisexual youth face, and it found bisexual teens “had lower levels of family acceptance, were less likely to know of sup-port systems and resources that could help them, and were less likely to be out than their gay and lesbian peers.”Th e lack of acceptance is due in part to a lack of role models and positive stereotypes in the media for young people.“Some days I feel like I have a foot in both worlds, yet never really belonging to either,” Brown said in a recent interview with the Associated Press.She explained even her gay friends will call her “half queer.”Brown’s words ring true.Biphobia and bisexual erasure are real.Monosexuals, those who are attracted to one gender, still display a fundamental lack of understanding of bisexuality as a concept.Bisexuals are still called greedy, con-fused and half-queer.When we’re kids, we call it bullying. When we grow up, we call it hate. Even within the queer community there is hatred.I’ve had both male and female partners express insecurities about me leaving them for the opposite gender. I’ve had my sexual-ity thrown back in my face during count-less arguments, leaving me to defend myself against the people I love and respect most.I had an ex-girlfriend who completely erased my attraction to men in her lan-guage. During a discussion of the bound-aries of our relationship she brought up the possibility of an open relationship of dating other girls.“Other people,” I said.“Other girls,” she said, completely unwilling to acknowledge the possibility of me also dating men.A person’s sexuality is not defi ned by the partner they are currently with, nor by any of their past or potential future partners.Biphobia is more nuanced than just an “us vs. them” situation. Bisexuals are rejected by the “us,” and invalidated by the “them,” so what’s left ? Who are we?Th is makes me think of the fi rst bisexual woman in government, Eleanor Roosevelt.I admire the former fi rst lady for the work she did to advance women’s rights, and discovering she was bisexual was a huge moment for me. Here was someone who is a respected fi gure in American his-tory, and she’s just like me!Eleanor Roosevelt’s most noted lady love, Lorena Hickok, was a journalist for the Associated Press.In 2000, journalism professor Richard Streitmatter published “Empty With-out You: Th e Intimate Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok,” in which transcribed over 300 letters exchanged by the pair.Contained in the letters is the infor-mation that forced Hickok to leave her position at the Associated Press because she could no longer objectively report on the Roosevelts.Granted, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s aff airs with women were kept secret, given they were illegal at the time, but to ignore the truth about Eleanor Roosevelt’s bisexuality is to participate in bisexual erasure.For a long time, I hesitated to call myself bisexual because of all the baggage that came with the label. At times, I outright re-jected being called bisexual, hiding behind the rigid notion that the binary nature of the “bi” prefi x limits expression.Th e term bisexual has been redefi ned and broadened to mean attraction to gen-ders both similar and diff erent to your own.With a defi nition like that, I am proud to call myself bisexual.Raechel Price is a Spartan Daily staff writer.

Uber should have done the same. Th e company should im-mediately notify the public about what happened, no matter how embarrassing the situation.In this data breach, the informa-tion of 50,000 drivers was accessed by an unknown third party.Th is information included the names of the drivers and their driver’s license.Uber said the amount of drivers are a small portion of all of the drivers who work for the company. Th is doesn’t justify the data breach.Th e drivers who were aff ected by this data breach should quit working for Uber since there is no sense of security.Th is isn’t the fi rst time the company has gone through data privacy issues.Uber can argue the stock of most companies that have suff ered data breaches haven’t been aff ect-ed, but the stock price shouldn’t matter. Th e safety of drivers is what should be most important.Uber sent a notifi cation to its drivers about what happened and assured them they will provide more safety measures to protect its drivers.In the notifi cation, Uber told its drivers their names and driver’s license are no longer accessible.Drivers who work for Uber can feel better aft er a blog post on its website which stated they will sue the person who accessed the data of the drivers.Customers’ information was not accessed in this data breach, but they should not be surprised if their credit card information gets hacked since the information of drivers was accessed.In this case, it’s safer to just pay a taxi driver cash instead of paying for car rides through a smart-phone.President Barack Obama proposed a federal law in Janu-ary which said if a company gets hacked, it should let its customers know about this situation within 30 days.Obviously Uber took more than 30 days to make a notifi cation about this data breach.Customers should not trust Uber aft er this, since it took so long for Uber to make this infor-mation public.Was Uber trying to hide the data breach all along?Hopefully the Target data breach of customers doesn’t hap-pen to Uber.Millions of Target customers suff ered this data breach during late 2013, when most of their credit and debit card information was accessed.Uber should tighten up their data security if they don’t want to lose customers.Adrian Monroy is a Spartan Daily staff writer.Uber trust is dubious aft er security breachAdrian MonroyFollow Adrianon Twitter @iammanr0yFinding your purpose in life as a young adult can easily be equated to fi nding your car keys before a midterm exam—near impossible, as it rightfully should be.Many people in their mid-20s fi nd themselves in a similar quar-rel when they exit their predeter-mined roles as either a high school or college graduate. What is my purpose in this thing called life?As a young man at the bris-tling age of 22, I can honestly say I fi gure out new things about myself daily.Introverted to the maximum and deep in thought while oft en medicated from California’s fi nest medicinal fl owers, I too oft en harp on fi nding my purpose. Th e search is wasted time and energy to say the least.Young people can sometimes look to adults who we view as successful, inspirational and im-pactful, acknowledging how they have carved a personal path and expect ourselves to do what they’ve done over decades in a fraction of that time.Th e frantic speed of America’s capitalistic society—otherwise known as the “rat race”—along with major responsibilities like paying your own rent or buying your own food compel young folks to fi nd their own meaning in this world, and to fi nd it now.It does not help that any young person who has had a religious upbringing has likely dealt with the unnecessary pressure to fi nd purpose through their God.“I think having a God would create a meaning for our lives, like we’re working toward a purpose—and it’s all worthwhile because at the end of the day we will maybe move on to another life where everything is beautiful. I love that idea,” Christian-turned-agnostic Kyle Simpson said in an interview with National Public Radio.It can also be tough for me to watch a young rapper like Drake jump out of a topless Bentley in the snow with a mink coat to keep him warm as he yells how he “started from the bottom.”He seems to be a young man who has fi gured out his purpose, blended it with his passion and seems to be very pleased with where his life trajectory is headed.Drake, whose name is Aubrey Graham, went through his own struggle prior to becoming the self-proclaimed “6 God.” He put out a full catalog of songs includ-ing two mixtapes that largely went unnoticed in comparison with his recent commercial success and also played a corny co-starring role in a show that no man with dignity will ever admit to watching before joining ranks with rapper Lil Wayne and setting America on fi re in 2009.In order to not beat myself over the head out of self-dissatisfaction while I whip around in my 1996 Toyota Camry with my gas slightly below empty, I remind myself that I am not Drake, and try to remem-ber the importance of embracing my own path to whatever I deem successful.“Your purpose in life is to fi nd your purpose and give your whole heart and soul to it,” Gautama Buddha said. Notice he did not mention any-thing about time restraints.Could you possibly fathom that if you are a struggling college student or recent graduate you perhaps are exactly where you need to be to get to where you’re headed and you don’t need to rush to a purpose, success or anything in between? Sounds insane right?I fi nd that the beauty to this purpose-searching madness is to embrace the good with the bad and to understand that you know very little and can learn so much.Remaining grounded in this moment is the only pressure you should place upon yourself. Th at other s--- is for the birds.Damien Percy is a Spartan Daily staff writer. Finding purpose is overrated in your 20sDamien PercyFollow Damienon Twitter @percybankedBY ARNO BRYANT@MrArnoBryantA sellout crowd will roar the San Jose Earthquakes into a new era next Sunday at 4 p.m. as the team kicks off  the fi rst regular season game at its new home.Th e construction of a European-style and pur-pose-built soccer stadium has been the ambition of the team for over 40 years.Keeping track of the Earthquakes’ turbulent his-tory has been lifetime fan Gary Singh.“All the people that have cleaned the grass, all the people that partied in the parking lot, all the people that have sold advertising, all the ticket reps, all the coaches, all the play-ers, are all part of this fabulous new build-ing,” Singh said.Singh's book, ‘Th e San Jose Earthquakes: A Seismic Soccer Leg-acy\" came out Mon-day and aims to patch together the history of the various Quakes’ incarna-tions.“I grew up here in the '70s,” he said. “San Fran-cisco had the Giants and 49ers, Oakland had the A’s and Raiders and in San Jose, we had the Earth-quakes … It was the sport that built this town.”Th e Earthquakes joined the North American Soc-cer League in 1974 and quickly became one of the biggest teams in the league, averaging an attendance of more than 16,000.“San Jose was defi nite-ly one of the main cities that helped the sport grow in the '70s,” Singh said. “Th roughout the rest of the country they were looking at us and saying 'if some unknown hick town like San Jose can produce a massive crowd, anyone can do it.'\"Since the '70s, the Earthquakes have been through two name chang-es, one fold, one hiatus and a move to Texas.“Th ere have been many lives, many births, deaths and reincarnations of this sport in the San Jose area,” Singh said.Th e construction of the Avaya Stadium owes a lot to the Soccer Silicon Valley Community Foundation.“Th eir main goal is that they want to bring their kids to see the games the same way that their parents brought them to see the games,” Singh said.The team hopes the Avaya Stadium will give the club the stability needed to breed the future fanbase.Among them will be Quakes fan Griffi  n Olson.“I was born in '99 and went to my fi rst game when I was 10 weeks old,” Olson said.“I remember going to the tailgates at Spartan Stadium, and how big that stadium felt … it became a special bonding expe-rience for my dad and I,\" Olson said. \"He was the guy who would go down the aisle and yell at the ref if he couldn't keep up to make the right calls. Other teenagers might be embarrassed by this, but I was proud that he was my dad.”Th e club orig-inally hoped to move into the stadium at the start of the 2014 season but faced issues with the site’s foun-dation.Earthquakes President Dave Kaval described in a statement how the con-struction workers “found over 70 vaults, sub-vaults, basements and over 250 massive underground pil-ings on the site.”“The demolition team nicknamed the vaults ice-bergs as they never knew how big each one was go-ing to be … several of the vaults were larger than an Olympic-sized swimming pool,” Kaval's statement said.Th e stadium consists of three steep stands with a capacity of 18,000 includ-ing a section of standing terraces.Behind the other goal is the largest outdoor bar in North America with over 45 beer taps.Th e club has sold 12,000 season tickets with the remaining tickets for the Chicago match completely sold out.Th e Earthquakes are ranked sixth in the West-ern Conference aft er last weekend's 3–2 win over Seattle.San Jose will host the Chicago Fire at home for its fi rst regular season home game this Sunday.Arno Bryant is a Spartan Daily staff writer.Gary Singh poses for a photo at Avaya Stadium in San Jose awaiting the re-lease of his book, “The San Jose Earthquakes: A Seismic Soccer Legacy,” released on Monday. Randy Vazquez | Spartan DailySan Jose: 40 years at the epicenter of soccerThere have been many lives, many births, deaths, and reincarna-tions of this sport in the San Jose areaGary SinghAuthor of “Th e San Jose Earthquakes: A Seismic Soccer Legacy””“Bowlers Association’s Sands Regency West/Northwest Winter Classic, netting a $2,000 prize.“It was kinda a last minute thing. My mom brought it up. I didn’t know there was a PBA event,” Darren Tang said.Darren Tang recorded a 7–2–1 match play record with an 18-game total of 4,589 pins during the tournament.“I went up to bowl the ‘non-champs’ event on the Friday before the tournament, I bowled pretty well and got through the round of four,” Darren Tang said. “I had a pretty good game plan for the next day, ended up qualifying second. Th en aft er they cut to the top 10 I ended up winning … it was a great experience.”Th is is the latest in a long line of bowling success for Darren Tang and his brother Mi-chael Tang, a sophomore psychology major, who grew up bowling together.“Our mom and dad they were bowlers, my dad worked in a bowling alley, so we nat-urally got into bowling,” Darren Tang said.In 2006, Michael Tang became the youngest competitive bowler to roll a perfect game at the age of 10. “Th at record stood worldwide for nine months,” Michael said.Michael Tang made headlines in 2010 when he was labeled “Th e Storm Prodigy,” winning the opportunity to bowl against one of bowling’s biggest names, Norm Duke.Considered one of America’s greatest bowlers, Duke won his fi rst tournament when we has 18 and has won 38 tour titles since. A 15-year-old Michael Tang still ran him close, eventually losing 263–243.“It was more of a fun thing, it would have been nice to beat him,” Michael Tang said.According to the Team USA’s bowling team’s wesbite, Both brothers have been selected by Team USA, Darren Tang in 2014 and Michael Tang in 2015.Despite SJSU’s success, bowling is still struggling to be seen as a serious sport on campus.“When I tell people I’m on the bowling team, they go ‘What? We have a bowling team?’ so I guess we don’t get much recogni-tion at all,” Michael Tang said.The team trains at 4th Street Bowl while the current Bowling Center is closed as part of the Student Union ren-ovations.“Th ere’s been pros and cons,” Darren Tang said, comparing the locations. “Ob-viously on campus it was a lot easier. If we wanted to practice between classes we could just jump down there and bowl. But the benefi ts of bowling here (at 4th Street Bowl) are they get to lay out diff erent pat-terns for us.”Arno Bryant is a Spartan Daily staff writer.BOWLINGFROM PAGE 1Darren Tang prepares to send the ball down the lane in the San Jose State bowling team’s practice at 4th Street bowl on Feb. 26.
