A lot ofattention has been devoted to the reasons influencing individual voting decisions, with some progress inunderstanding within-country variation in the vote. But these studies usually assume that perceptionscoincide with objective reality. This article addresses this shortcoming, using quantitative text analysisand spatial econometrics to show that local narratives – sometimes more than contextual statistics – candrive spatial differences in the populist vote. Taking Spain as an example, I train a machine learningalgorithm to determine the prevalence of given news topics across the national territory based on howmany related articles local newspapers published on Twitter in the year before the last national election.I then use spatial econometric techniques to link these results to local divergences in support for theradical right party VOX. The analysis sheds some light onto the economic anxiety - cultural backlash- geography of discontent debate. The empirical evidence supports the notion that narratives abouteconomic anxiety and regional gaps matter, but also shows that narratives about separatism played akey role in the rise of the radical right in Spain.Keywords: radical right support, local newspapers, machine learning algorithm, Twitter, Spain∗Scholar in the International Inequalities Institute (III) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)11 IntroductionThe vote in favor of radical right parties (RRPs) has soared throughout Western democracies since the early2000s, in what has been dubbed the ‘fourth-wave’ of the far right (Golder 2016; 2019). This resurgencehas provoked both alarm and interest among some segments of the political establishment, civil society andacademia. For, even with limited support in the polls, radical right outfits have proven capable of successfullyintroducing arguments into the political mainstream, getting parties elsewhere in the spectrum to back theirpolicies (Inglehart and Norris, 2016).The rise of RRPs has rekindled the debate around the reasons driving voting decisions (Mudde, 2019).Aiming to contribute to the discussion, this project focuses on one of its geographical dimensions: how, ifat all, do local narratives relate to radical right voting patterns? In other words, can one gauge pro-RRPsentiment from the topics a community talks about? To answer this narrower question, I posit that localnewspapers tend to reflect local divergences in narratives in the articles they publish. This may occurbecause journalists themselves wish to influence the narrative or because they target articles to their localaudience in order to maximize profit. In both scenarios, the topics of the articles published across differentgeographical locations tell us something about how the inhabitants of those places see the world and cantherefore provide some insight into why they vote the way they do.This paper is thus based on the simple idea that the more news articles written on a specific topic in agiven location, the more prevalent the issue in local voters’ minds. I apply this notion to the Spanish context,where the radical right has recently gained traction. To gather narratives across the Spanish territory, I applymachine learning techniques and build a new dataset with information mined from Twitter on which newstopics were more prevalent in each Spanish municipality during the year before the last national election.This new dataset, matched with municipal electoral results, allows for an understanding of whether economic,regional or cultural arguments were more prevalent in areas with high shares of support for the radical right.This article contributes to earlier research in the fields of quantitative political analysis and political ge-ography. More specifically, it relates to one of the long-standing debates in the political literature: whetherRRP political clout stems from deteriorating economic conditions or from a discontent about the culturalchanges brought about by globalization (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). While the traditional works on thissubject tend to take a rather ‘global’ perspective, focusing on individual voter characteristics and puttingaside within-country variation in RRP vote, more recent research by economic geographers highlights thespatial unevenness of radical right vote (Ferrante and Pontarollo, 2020; Rodŕıguez-Pose et al., 2020; Esslet-zbichler et al., 2021). This unevenness has led to the emergence of a third side in the debate: the rise of theradical right is thought to bring to the fore previously unheard grievances about widening spatial inequalities2and may speak to the importance of a so-called ‘geography of discontent’ (Cramer, 2016; Rodŕıguez-Pose,2018; McCann, 2019) (see Section 2 for some background information on these concepts). Finally, the analy-sis of narratives offers the opportunity to test an additional hypothesis specific to the Spanish context: thatthe radical right has benefitted from resentments linked to the increasing prominence of regional politicalmovements in favor of independence from the Spanish state (Turnbull-Dugarte, 2019; Heyne and Manucci,2021).Given the data available, disentangling these arguments is not easy. One key issue with both global andregional models is that they use either personal characteristics or actual data on relevant issues – such asunemployment or immigration – as proxies for perceptions. Despite this, research in psychology suggeststhat people rely on heuristics or mental shortcuts rather than ‘hard data’ when making choices (Lau andRedlawsk, 2001). This would seem to indicate that narratives – the stories we tell ourselves and each otherabout how the world works – may go well beyond statistics in shaping individual (voting) decisions (Shiller,2017). In this respect, the techniques used in this paper constitute a useful alternative to track politicalpreferences at the local level.The results suggest that grievances triggered by separatism and economic anxiety played the largest rolein VOX’s political rise. The results also show partial confirmation of the geography of discontent hypothesis:perceptions of large regional disparities were positively correlated with the radical right vote. Curiously,however, a higher share of news articles dealing with grievances over lack of resources/local investmenttended to lower – rather than raise – radical right support. The mainstream right benefited from suchsentiments instead. In contrast, support in favor of the cultural backlash hypothesis was far more limited,being largely washed out when controlling for local age profiles.The rest of the article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a summary on two different strands of theliterature: the first is an account of the economic anxiety-cultural backlash debate and the global and localreasons behind the success of the radical right more broadly; the second focuses on the importance of (social)media – and Twitter in particular –, both in the process of building narratives and in informing individualvoting decisions. Section 3 includes a short description of the radical right in Spain. I subsequently discussthe chosen empirical strategy (section 4), compare perceptions with the socioeconomic statistics most oftenused in the literature (section 5), and present the results (section 6). Section 7 concludes.32 Theoretical background2.1 The reasons behind the success of the radical rightThe impressive political gains made by RRPs since the 1980s have led to a large body of comparativeliterature that aims to explain why radical right ideologies fail in some places but take root in others.Researchers broadly agree that, especially in its initial stages, support for the radical right depends on aparty being able to mobilize existing grievances or resentments (Betz, 2002). In this regard, the most recentresearch emphasizes the importance of globalization and the socioeconomic cleavages it has created in society.There is a lively debate, however, regarding how these issues catalyze into actual votes in favor of RRPs.This discussion is often referred to as the economic anxiety-cultural backlash debate: either individualdecisions to vote for the radical right owe to anxieties over the economic difficulties brought about byglobalization (the economic argument) or to a rejection of the cultural changes that come with a moreinterconnected world (the so-called cultural backlash argument) (Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Mudde, 2019).Until recently, this debate took a spatially blind – or rather global – viewpoint. There were manyindividual-level studies and cross-country comparisons, but rarely did any of them acknowledge the spatialunevenness of RRP vote within countries (Golder, 2016). This has changed in recent years. A growing bodyof research focuses on the geography of discontent – a term used to describe local feelings of resentmentbrought about by the territorial polarization of resources, itself an upshot of the power of agglomerationeconomies (Essletzbichler et al., 2018; Rodŕıguez-Pose, 2018, 2020; Broz et al., 2021).As we will see, these global and local points of view are not necessarily contradictory. Evidence fromother contexts suggests it is in fact possible that all these theories play a role in the rise of the radical rightin Spain. This paper therefore focuses on understanding whether: a) local narratives exist across Spanishmunicipalities that align with each of these theories; and b) whether these narratives are able to explainthe recent success of the RRP VOX (see section 3 for some background information on the radical right inSpain).The following sub-sections provide a brief account of each of these theories. This framework is then usedto link the theories with specific narratives (i.e. the topics of local newspaper articles) on the ground:2.1.1 The economic argumentAdvocates of the economic argument emphasize globalization’s role in spawning grievances related to individ-ual economic conditions. They focus on the consequences of the rise of the knowledge economy, automationand outsourcing, the dwindling importance of unions, the rising power of multinational firms, and the imple-4mentation of neoliberal austerity policies, among other effects of globalization (see, for instance, Colantoneand Stanig 2018 or Milner 2021). All these factors are linked to worsening labor conditions and increasingeconomic inequalities, which have created winners and losers in society. In Southern Europe in particular,both declining trust in government and the rise of RRPs have been connected to the devastating impact theGreat Recession had in those countries (Foster and Frieden, 2017; Rossi, 2018).Despite this, attempts to link support for the radical right with contextual-level unemployment – usedas a proxy for the economic anxiety argument – have found inconclusive results (see Sipma and Lubbers2018 for a meta-analysis of the literature). Furthermore, there is currently no leading explanation as to whythe association is so different across studies. One should therefore consider the option that narratives – howpeople talk about precariousness, poverty, and unemployment – may not coincide with what we observe inunemployment statistics. If this is so, are then narratives about the economic argument able to explain therise in radical right support? To answer these questions, we can state as a hypothesis of interest that:Hypothesis 1 Radical right support is associated with local concerns about unemployment and poverty.2.1.2 The cultural backlash argumentThe cultural backlash camp puts forward a different take on progress and globalization. According to thistheory, voters do not support RRPs because they worry about their economic future; rather, they rebelagainst a shift in societal values away from traditional ways of life and towards more individual freedom,multiculturalism, respect for diversity, and gender and racial equality (Arzheimer, 2018).But the specific mechanisms behind this cultural backlash are still up for debate. Inglehart and Norris(2016) link these worldviews to individual authoritarian tendencies. In contrast, Schäfer (2021) compellinglyshows that authoritarian values do not appear to drive populist support; it is rather attitudes towardsimmigration, political trust, and beliefs that the government will respond to voters’ demands that matterinstead.In part because of data availability, much of the literature has focused on attitudes towards migrants. Yet,the link between immigration and support for the radical right has proven hard to trace. At the individuallevel, multiple studies show that radical right backers hold more anti-immigrant views than other voters(e.g. Rydgren 2008). But, at the aggregate level, the size of the immigrant community has just as oftenbeen found to have an effect on RRP support (e.g. Tabellini 2020) as no effect (e.g. Lucassen and Lubbers2012). In this regard, research has shown that widespread beliefs about an issue – say, that there are toomany migrants in a community, as in Stockemer (2016) or Alesina et al. (2018) – may exert more influenceon RRP vote than the existence of the issue itself.5But the cultural backlash hypothesis goes well beyond perceptions about immigration. Views on LGBTQ+issues are also seen as important indicators in this regard (see both Inglehart and Norris 2016 and Schäfer2021). Feelings of social integration (or a lack thereof) are also deemed relevant (Gidron and Hall, 2019). Inthis sense, Bolet (2021) argues in favor of the importance of the ‘degradation of local socio-cultural hubs’.She provides evidence of a link between the loss of community centers where people socialize – pubs, in herpaper – on RRP support. She connects this effect to a sense of social isolation and a loss of cultural identity.Clearly, this approach requires some contextual adaptation: pubs do not quite play the same role in Spainas they do in the UK, but one could think of a similar dynamic taking place with churches, for instance.One fact that should have already become clear is that the cultural backlash hypothesis deals with amulti-faceted phenomenon. And, as Schäfer points out: ‘It is [not] obvious (...) that citizens who oppose(some form of) migration also reject same-sex marriage, female emancipation or religious pluralism’ (Schäfer,2021, p. 16). This is despite the fact that we may want to associate all of these views to social conservatismmore broadly. Consequently, a hypothesis aligned with the cultural backlash theory would be:Hypothesis 2 Radical right support is associated with local narratives focused on different types of socialconservatism (e.g. centered on the topics of religion and immigration, or featuring negative reporting onfeminism/LGBTQ+ issues).2.1.3 The geography of discontent argumentAs I mentioned above, many studies define the economic anxiety-cultural backlash debate from a globalperspective. Nevertheless, recent political events have put local and regional issues at the forefront of thediscussion (Golder, 2016). There are, after all, large gaps between local areas in the shares of populist RRPvote (see Ferrante and Pontarollo 2020 for an account of differences across European regions). Essletzbichlerand co-authors report, for instance, that ”[t]he populist vote shares ranged from (...) 21.3 to 75.6% inBritish Local Authorities and from 4.1 to 95.3% in US counties.” (Essletzbichler et al., 2018, p. 80). In thisregard, there is a new conventional wisdom, in large part influenced by the media’s portrayal of the politicallandscape in the United States and the United Kingdom, which describes RRP vote – and the populist vote,more broadly – as a mostly rural phenomenon (Mitsch et al., 2021). But, while the gaps in voting patternsbetween urban and rural communities do exist, the geographies of electoral outcomes are somewhat morecomplicated than this rather simplistic view would lead us to think (Becker et al., 2017; Essletzbichler et al.,2018; Rossi, 2018).Recent research introduces some caveats into the urban-rural dichotomy. It rather points to the linkbetween globalization and the discontent emanating from lagging regions, who see themselves as the victims6of an economic model that has wittingly left them behind. Works on the geography of discontent highlightthat the real or perceived economic decline outlined by the proponents of the economic argument need notbe recent, or even present in voters’ own lives. There is evidence that voters who live in previously well-to-do but now declining places are more likely to vote for populist parties (Rodŕıguez-Pose, 2020). Peoplein those areas may not necessarily be worried about current economic hardships; instead, they resent risingterritorial inequalities and a political system that agglomerates all jobs and economic opportunities in cities,leaving their native localities to deal with long-term economic and industrial decline (McCann, 2019; Brozet al., 2021). Inhabitants in those locations are thought to resort to the ballot box after years of discontentwith an economic system they see as leaving their hometowns with no resources, and therefore offering noopportunities for their neighbors and younger generations (Guilluy, 2010; Lee et al., 2018; Rodŕıguez-Pose,2018; Ferreira, 2019; Rodŕıguez-Pose et al., 2020). While this change in political preferences may seemrecent, it is the result of a slow-growing but deeply entrenched resentment to urban elites and the regionalinequalities they are perceived to support (Cramer, 2016).Based on this strand of the literature, we can state as a new hypothesis of interest that:Hypothesis 3 Radical right support owes to grievances over regional economic disparities or to a perceptionthat the local area does not receive enough investment/resources.The focus on regional disparities takes a distinctly important role in the case of Spain. Center-peripheryissues have historically constituted an important cleavage in Spanish politics (Pardos-Prado and Sagarzazu,2019). And, while some of these concerns align with the geography of discontent hypothesis outlined above,the 2019 elections took place at a point of particularly increased tensions around the topic of devolutionof powers to the autonomous regions (Rama et al., 2021). In particular, the Catalan referendum – whichtook place on October 1st 2017 followed by a unilateral declaration of independence shortly thereafter –exacerbated political positions on the issue of devolution. VOX was able to capitalize on this phenomenonby advocating for a tough stance on separatists (Turnbull-Dugarte, 2019; Rama et al., 2021; Heyne andManucci, 2021). In this regard, Turnbull-Dugarte (2019) makes a strong case for the importance of theCatalan issue on the radical right’s success in subsequent regional elections. Rama et al. (2021) furthersuggest that this effect also translated into increased support for VOX in the November 2019 nationalelections. Based on this literature, an additional hypothesis of interest is:Hypothesis 4 Radical right support owes to grievances over separatist movements 1.1Both in Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Navarre.72.1.4 Why focus on narratives?The vast majority of the studies cited throughout this section aim to establish the validity of each argumentusing data on actual migration and economic conditions. While this may provide us with useful knowledge,one should keep in mind that voters’ perceptions are key to determining voting decisions. If what in factguides people’s voting preferences is the prevalent narrative in their region, locality or social group, it isno wonder that evidence, in particular for the economic argument, remains elusive. Several studies in thefields of psychology and political science support this idea. People are known to behave as cognitive misers,relying on heuristics or shortcuts rather than on statistics when making decisions (Lau and Redlawsk,2001). In addition, if they stumble upon information that clashes with their world views, voters havebeen shown to apply motivated reasoning – an emotionally-biased mental process that reduces cognitivedissonance by rejecting the validity of new contradictory data (Lodge and Taber, 2013). These results suggestthat narratives play a role beyond socioeconomic statistics in informing voters’ preferences. Consequently,understanding the rise in RRP support may require a substantive shift in focus towards the analysis of textsand other forms of communication used to build and spread narratives.2.2 (Social) media, local narratives and the radical rightMedia reporting is seen as one of the main channels through which citizens form their own perceptions aboutwhich social and economic matters are important (Lodge and Taber, 2013). While each individual willhave their own experiences regarding economic and political issues, like unemployment or immigration, themedia is thought to be able to influence these views through two mechanisms: agenda-setting and priming.Agenda-setting theories claim that the media, in selecting to report about certain subjects but not others,increases the salience of those topics relative to all other potential politically relevant themes. This shortlistof issues is then used by individual voters as a measuring stick with which to evaluate the performance ofdifferent political parties – in what is known as priming (Ellinas, 2018). As a result, it is possible to establisha causal link between media reporting and RRP support (see Devine and Murphy 2020 or Foos and Bischof2022 for examples in the UK).But, while much of the literature focuses on how the news media sways public perception, there isevidence that the relationship may also run in the opposite direction. The advent of the internet has led toincreasing competition in media markets, reducing individual organizations’ market power. The decline ofpaper media and the increasing privatization of media outlets in many countries have pitted news informationsources against each other in a race for advertisement revenue. These changes in the market for news have8turned newspaper informational asymmetry on its head: news control used to be exclusively in the hands ofjournalists. Now there is evidence that audiences may also have a say (Gentzkow and Shapiro, 2010; Ellinas,2018).Social media plays a key role in this process. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been rising inimportance as places where people are made aware of and consume news content (Center, 2014, 2019a).Already back in 2014, 28% of Spanish adults used social media as a source for news. This percentage was ashigh as 35% among 18-24 year olds (Nielsen and Schrøder, 2014). These numbers are on the rise and theyreflect one of the most notable changes in the operation of the news media industry: journalists’ increasingreliance on social media sites to share and promote news articles (Ju et al., 2014). This reliance has beenshown to play a particularly important role for small, local newspapers (Center, 2019b). The pattern inpart owes to the fact that social media makes it practical and inexpensive for newsrooms to track andcater to readers’ preferences. There are several accounts of news agencies’ obsession with clicks (i.e. onlinearticle visits) and how these affect the subsequent selection of news stories (e.g. Welbers et al. 2016). Thiswould explain, for example, why newspaper coverage seems to tail, rather than precede, public perceptionof different economic issues (Hopkins et al., 2017).Some authors alert that a potential shortfall of these dynamics is that it is increasingly possible “to getthe news we want and ignore the rest” (Boczkowski and Mitchelstein, 2013, p. 3). Many social media usersrely on family, friends and acquaintances’ recommendations to provide them with the news they care about.Some do not even appear to feel the need to click through to the news article itself; the short blurb postedon Facebook or Twitter does the job well enough (Center, 2014).Despite these shortcomings, conversations taking place on social media shape local narratives in funda-mental ways. By engaging with the news content promoted through a newspaper’s Twitter feed, individualsfeel connected to the world around them and develop ideas about how it functions. Social networks alsoallow readers to become part of the conversation, both by commenting and sharing news content (Center,2019b; Casadei and Lee, 2020). These dynamics imply that newspapers’ Twitter feeds can also be seen asa constant reflection of the equilibrium between news supply and demand in a given area. In other words,they constitute a reflection of the most prevalent worldviews in a given location. Based on this notion, thisarticle focuses on the use newspapers make of Twitter to understand the prevailing narratives across differentlocalities in Spain.93 The radical right in Spain: A brief backgroundPolitical support for the radical right in Spain is fairly recent – something that sets the country apart frommost of its European neighbors. In fact, Spain features only one such outfit. Founded in 2013, VOX is thesecond far-right party to have gained access to Congress since the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975.Despite crashing in its first electoral campaigns in 2015 and 2016, VOX obtained 15% of the vote in theNovember 2019 national election. This success was largely unexpected, and only heralded by its performancein the Andalusian and Valencian regional elections in 2018 and 2019, where VOX obtained 11% and 18% ofthe vote, respectively.Akin to other European nations, Spanish vote in favor of RRPs is highly uneven across the territory (seeFigure 1). The vote for VOX in different municipalities ranged from nil to almost 60% in some constituencies.Some of these differences are regional in nature – there are much lower levels of support in Galicia, theBasque Country, Navarre, Catalonia, and the Canary Islands. These patterns are likely to have historicalorigins and/or owe to supply-side arguments regarding the make-up of the political landscape prior to VOX’sfoundation.Figure 1: Share of the vote in favor of VOX during the November 2019 Spanish parliamentary election.Plotted from the data published by the Spanish Interior Ministry.But, once those differences are accounted for, there still remains striking local variation. In particular,10VOX was the most voted party in 283 of Spain’s 8131 municipalities (3.5% of the total). Rather thanclustered together, these municipalities are scattered across the national territory. Most intriguingly, theydo not necessarily align with broader administrative boundaries, indicating that historical patterns areunlikely to explain the variation.In terms of ideology, VOX is commonly classified as a radical right-wing populist party (Rooduijn et al.,2019). This description owes to an agenda blending neoliberal economic ideology with elements of nativismand an authoritarian push for the recentralization of Spain’s de facto federal state (Heyne and Manucci, 2021).These elements are plainly visible in VOX’s foundational manifesto, where there are multiple references to thenation state and institutional reform. Economic growth and traditional values are also mentioned, lendingcredence to all camps in the economic-regional-cultural backlash debate (VOX, 2016; Rama et al., 2021).4 Measuring narratives4.1 DataThis article makes use of a newly built dataset, which includes all original information published by Spanishnewspapers on Twitter during the year 2018. I used a scraper to automatically visit Twitter’s search page,search for a given newspaper’s daily tweets within a specific time frame, and download each tweet, as wellas relevant linked metadata. I undertook this process with handles corresponding to all Spanish newspaperscurrently in circulation – 121 in total (see external appendix for more information on the list of newspapers,their location and geographical coverage) – and then gathered all information into a single dataset. This ledto a total of over 2 million tweets.Tweets in the dataset cover the whole period between January 1st and December 31st, 2018. This timeframe was chosen to balance the representativeness of all topics usually covered by newspapers. The selectionof a whole natural year prevents an excessive prevalence of certain topics due to the time of year (e.g. tweetson religion are particularly common during Easter, as are tweets about road traffic in the summer months).Since the number of tweets was too large for the computational capacity available, the analysis in this paperwas undertaken on a 10% random sample of the initial dataset.The new Twitter dataset is complemented by municipal-level information on the results of the Novem-ber 2019 parliamentary elections and various sociodemographic characteristics. In particular, this seconddataset includes key information on election turnout as well as population levels, the share of migrants andunemployment.114.2 Natural language processingData sourced from newspapers and social media is highly unstructured. Fortunately, advances in quantitativetext analysis now offer the possibility to identify themes in written output. While these techniques do requirean important initial effort, once the algorithm functions they can be applied to large swathes of data. In thispaper, I make use of one such method to identify the main topics in tweets by different Spanish newspapers:a Naive Bayes classifier.Naive Bayes classifiers, as many other such algorithms, make use of the ‘bag-of-words’ representation.The bag-of-words method begins by creating a single vector of word counts (wj) for each document (di) inthe dataset. The algorithm therefore operates on a very large matrix, which shows how many times eachtweet (di, as rows) includes words from a pre-existing vocabulary set V (i.e. columns, or the list of allwords in all tweets). Word order is not taken into account, and as a result grammar and syntax are deemedunimportant. While this method may seem rough, it works remarkably well in this paper’s area of interest:topic analysis (Manning et al., 2008).The Naive Bayes classifier is based on the well-known Bayes theorem:argmaxk∈KP (k|d) = argmaxk∈KP (d|k) P (k)P (d)The basic idea is that the algorithm leverages prior classification of a training set of tweets. Let’s takean example from the data to illustrate this. One (translated) tweet in the dataset reads:‘CITY The parish of Saint Mary organizes the most naval Easter mass’ 2This tweet would clearly fall under the religion category. However, for the algorithm to reach thisconclusion it first needs to use the prior manual classification to calculate the most probable topic basedon two main indicators: a) P (k), or the prior probability that this tweet, regardless of its content, belongsto topic k – in this case, this is equaivalent to the share of all manually labeled tweets that are classifiedas ‘religion’; and b) P (d|k), or the likelihood of finding this particular word combination (in any order),assuming that the right topic were indeed religion – i.e. the probability of finding the word ‘parish’ giventhat the tweet is about religion, times the probability that the tweet says ‘Saint’ given that it refers toreligion, etc.Naive Bayes thus assumes conditional independence. This is, the probability of word wj given a particulartopic k (P (wj |k)) is taken to be independent of topic k — hence the name ‘naive’. While this is certainly a2In Spanish: ‘CIUDAD La parroquia de Santa Maria organiza la comunion pascual mas marinera’12strong assumption, its application often outperforms other more complicated algorithms. Precisely becausethe model relies on very few parameters, the variance in its estimates tends to be low. This can oftencompensate for the bias in the results (Hand and Yu, 2001). In addition, bias may not matter as muchin cases such as this one, where the aim is simple classification according to topic and where topics havebeen selected to fit the classification method. More details on the functioning and training of Naive Bayesclassifiers are available in Jurafsky and Martin (2020).To train the algorithm, I first randomly ordered all tweets selected from analysis. I then manuallyclassified the first 18,000 tweets into different topics. I set no limits in terms of topic numbers; rather, Ifocused on making the topics relevant to the Spanish political landscape and to the theories outlined in theliterature section. This of course required trying to group tweets into groups that would be sufficiently largeand distinct for the algorithm to function. The result was a classification into 28 topics (see Annex A).One of those covers the economic argument (‘unemployment & poverty’), three correspond to the culturalbacklash side of the debate (‘feminism & LGBTQ+ issues’, ‘immigration’, and ‘religion’), another two topicsdeal with the geography of discontent : ‘regional gaps’ and ‘lack of resources’. The former includes tweetson depopulation and/or divergences in the political and economic development of the different regions; thelatter deals with any complaints of insufficient resources or local investment. Finally, a single topic coversthe ‘separatism’ hypothesis.Once the topic classification was completed, I applied the algorithm to the test set. The result was aclassification with 71.3% overall accuracy for the topics of interest, which could be extended to the rest ofthe tweets in the dataset 3. In any case, the results in the paper remain robust when calculating topic sharesonly based on the 18,000 manually labeled tweets.4.3 Classifying and aggregating topics by locationThe Naive Bayes classifier constitutes a useful tool to determine the topic of each tweet/article. However,the analysis in this paper requires a measure of topic prevalence by location. To obtain this variable it isfirst necessary to match newspapers to the municipalities where they are read (see Figure 2 for a summaryof the geographical distribution of the main topics relevant to the debate).Spanish newspapers can be classified into four categories depending on their geographical coverage:national, regional, provincial, or local – this last category refers to a number of smaller papers that do not3The accuracy calculations come from a confusion matrix based on the 18,000 manually labeled tweets: the first 2,000 tweetswere used as a training set and the remaining 16,000 as a test set. Mean accuracy – defined as the sum of true positives and truenegatives for each topic divided by the total number of positives and negatives – was much lower for the overall classification,remaining at a mere 53%. The algorithm often confuses topics within the international and national politics categories, forinstance. This is nonetheless unimportant for the purposes of this paper.13cover a whole province or may even cut across two different provinces. I used information in newspaperwebsites to determine in which municipalities each newspaper is sold. In the case of local papers where thisinformation was not readily available, I assume that the newspaper is sold in a 20km radius from the centerof the municipality where it is based. For example, the southernmost municipality in mainland Spain iscalled La Ĺınea de la Concepción, located in the province of Cádiz, in Andalusia. Neighbors in this areareceive five national newspapers (ABC, El Mundo, El Páıs, La Razón, and La Vanguardia), a regional outlet(El Correo de Andalućıa), three provincial journals (Diario de Cádiz, La Voz de Cádiz, and Viva Cádiz) andtwo local papers (Diario Área, based in La Ĺınea de la Concepción, and EuropaSur, based in Algeciras – anearby municipality).Once newspapers are matched to each municipality, it is possible to calculate the share of articles thatcover a specific topic by location.4 Of course, different newspapers may focus on the same issue and sometimeseven publish the exact same article. I do not eliminate these duplicates. The assumption here is that articleson the same piece of news indicate that the topic is more salient among the local population.I do however account for the differences in newspaper readership between areas. Local information onnewspaper readership is unavailable, but data does exist at the regional level. I make use of the ‘GeneralStudy on Media’ (’Estudio General de Medios’ or EGM, AIMC 2016) to generate weights that I apply toeach of the local topic shares. I generate a different weight for each national newspaper, as this allows todistinguish between their very marked differences in ideology. There is also a separate weight for regionaland local news outlets in each region, and an extra regional weight for papers classified as urban. The finaloutput from this process consists in a series of variables corresponding to the shares of news articles in thearea that fall within topic k. For instance, in La Ĺınea de la Concepción 4.2% of all newspaper tweets in2018 dealt with immigration.4A single tweet can be equalled to a newspaper article. This is because newspapers do in fact only tweet about their ownarticles. Each tweet almost always includes the article’s title, sometimes followed by a subtitle.14Figure 2: Geographical distribution of the main topics relevant to the rise of the radical right in Spain (asshares of local news tweets that correspond to each topic).155 Perceptions vs. realityIn Theoretical background section, I made the case for the reconsideration of each side of the economicanxiety - cultural backlash - geography of discontent debate from the perspective of local narratives. Inthis section, I highlight how this approach may paint a different picture from the one conveyed by the soleanalysis of socioeconomic statistics.I proceed to outline each of the sides of the debate in turn, trying to compare perceptions with reality,and highlighting differences between both. The next section tackles all three competing claims at once.5.1 The economic argumentFigure 3: Correlation between the unemployment rate across different Spanish urban areas and the corre-sponding share of unemployment coverage by local newspapers. Point scale indicates population size.16Contextual-level unemployment is the most common proxy for the economic anxiety argument in thequantitative political literature (see Sipma and Lubbers 2018 for a meta-analysis on the topic). I am in-terested in how actual levels of local unemployment relate to how often newspapers read in each urbanarea mention unemployment. Figure 3 undertakes this comparison 5. There is no statistically significantrelationship between the portrayal of the situation by newspapers and reality. Notice as well that this resultcomes along with a substantial degree of unexplained heterogeneity (see the difference between Lugo andSantander, for example). These gaps between perception and reality could explain some of the divergingresults found in the literature. They also lend credence to importance of focusing on narratives.5.2 The cultural backlash argumentThe cultural backlash argument is centered around evolving social values towards more tolerance of individualfreedoms as well as gender and racial equality. Admittedly, a large number of social issues fit within thiscategory. Despite this, the literature usually focuses exclusively on immigration, in large part because dataon the number of foreigners by location is readily available.Figure 4 shows the prevalence of the ‘immigration’ topic in relation to the actual share of foreign-bornindividuals across all Spanish urban areas. At the municipal level, there is a significant relationship betweenboth variables, albeit a very weak one (Pearson’s r coefficient equals 0.06). Places like Algeciras and Cádizmay see a lot of migrants cross the border from Morocco, but newcomers tend not to stay in those urbanareas. They head towards places where they may find better economic prospects. Somewhat ironically,journalists in those new locations do not give as much coverage to the issue.Once again, perceptions matter. More news about migrants on dinghies striving to cross the Gibraltarstrait may appeal to people in places marked by less cultural openness, regardless of how many migrantsactually live in the urban area. It might also simply be a reality that is more salient to people living inthe locations where those migrants first arrive (see Bah́ıa de Algeciras and Bah́ıa de Cádiz in Figure 4 –these are the urban areas nearest to migrants’ entry points from Morocco). This highlights the difficultyin distinguishing between xenophobic ideology – as RRP voters have often been labeled – and the generalsalience of the immigration topic, perhaps due to local circumstances. In this paper, in line with theassociation the literature makes between socially conservative values and radical right support, I assumethat ideology is the more relevant factor.5The plots in subsections 5.1 and 5.2 show aggregated data at the urban area level. This approach is taken for the sake ofgraph readability and to favor interpretation. Unless otherwise specified in the text, the relationships shown do not change inany way when the same analysis is undertaken at the municipal level.In the manual classification I used to build the algorithm, I use a joint ‘unemployment & poverty’ category. I bundled thesetwo somewhat distinct topics together because individual newspaper tweets usually allude to them both.17Figure 4: Correlation between the actual share of foreigners by urban area and the corresponding share ofcoverage on immigration issues by local newspapers. Point scale indicates population size.A further advantage of analyzing narratives lies in the increased scope for nuance. All competing argu-ments, and in particular those related to the geography of discontent and cultural grievances, encompass aseries of narratives. Immigration may indeed shape people’s views on globalization and modernization, butit is only a single aspect within what is in reality a large range of socioeconomic and cultural issues. Severalothers are highlighted in the literature: religion, support for liberal values (in issues such as gay marriage orabortion rights), etc.Using quantitative text analysis to classify narratives one can allow for the existence of different typesof socially conservative places. Table 1 suggests that there may indeed exist different types of social conser-vatism. One may think, for instance, that if more religious places are more socially conservative, they are18bound to hold more anti-immigrant values. I do not find this to be the case across Spanish urban areas.Table 1: Top and bottom 5 urban areas by density of the ‘religion’ topic. Each of the columns refers to thetopic prevalence across the urban area.Region Religion ImmigrationBurgos 11.4% 4.3%Segovia 9.1% 0.7%Jaén 7.7% 2.4%Salamanca 7.4% 0.8%Huelva 7.4% 0.8%Ferrol 0.9% 2.9%Soria 0.8% 0.8%Ávila 0.8% 0.8%Logroño 0.6% 3.5%Vitoria/Gasteiz 0.3% 0.3%5.3 The geography of discontentThe geography of discontent argument focuses on the disenchantment caused by perceptions of long-termeconomic decline in some localities, while those opportunities concentrate in other regions – and usually inurban areas. These graphs compare perceptions about ‘regional gaps’ with actual rates of depopulation anddivergences in the economic development of the different regions.Empirical evidence clearly indicates that, over the last six decades, Spaniards have moved to the country’smore economically dynamic regions (see Figure 5a). Some of the changes in population and GDP growthrelative to other regions are staggering. These patterns are reflected in journalistic complaints regardingregional disparities, broadly understood. Figure 5b shows the correlation between newspaper coverage ofregional divergences and long-term GDP growth. Regions with positive levels of development since 1955 arenot necessarily exempt from perceptions that their region is at a disadvantage with respect to other areasin the country – this is certainly the case in Murcia and the Canary Islands (Las Palmas). But, in general,it is places that lagged behind in Spain’s remarkable developmental push that concentrate perceptions ofregional divergences (Avila, Palencia, and Zamora are cases in point). I find similar results when drawingthe comparison with respect to long-term population decline (see external appendix).19(a) Relationship between long-term population growthand changes in the regional GDP shares (1955-2019).Point scale indicates population size.(b) Relationship between newspaper coverage on re-gional gaps and changes in the regional share of nationalGDP between 1955 and 2019. Point scale indicates pop-ulation size.6 What narratives suggest about the rise of the radical rightThe previous section provided an overview of how narratives linked to the three main theories aiming toexplain rising support for the radical right play out in Spain. The findings highlight that the prevalence ofdifferent topics in news reporting across the country often does not match the reality of each place. Onlyregarding regional discrepancies (relevant for the geography of discontent argument) does news reportingalign in a meaningful way with socioeconomic statistics.6.1 Baseline estimationsGiven the interest in perceptions and how they compare to what socioeconomic statistics say about eachmunicipality, I now test all four hypotheses at once. I start with a simple OLS cross-sectional model thatincludes newspaper coverage on relevant topics and standard controls as regressors. I then proceed to makecomparisons with socio-economic statistics. This baseline model can be written as:20ym = α+Xβ + ϵ =α+ γ unempm + κ SC′m + δ RD′m + σ sepm + β X′m(+ζ Z′m) + ϵm,where m refers to each Spanish municipality. The dependent variable is the share of the vote in favor ofthe RRP VOX. I expand on the selection of topics and other controls below:1. unempm refers to the unemployment & poverty topic share. It is therefore associated with the economicanxiety camp in the literature.2. SC ′m is a vector of topic densities linked to the cultural backlash side of the debate. As such, it aimsto capture social conservatism. It contains the topic shares for immigration, religion, and feminism &LGBTQ+ issues.3. RD′m is a vector of topic densities associated with the geography of discontent hypothesis. Focusingon perceptions of disparities between regions, it includes the regional gaps and lack of resources topicshares.4. sepm refers to the share of articles in a municipality that speak of separatist issues.5. X ′m is a vector of key demographic and political controls. These include:• Population density (as a logarithm): This variable aims to account for the expected rurality of theradical right vote. Nevertheless, note that earlier studies on Spain find that urban/rural statusdoes not play a role in RRP support (Turnbull-Dugarte et al., 2020).• The share of the population under 35 years of age who are eligible to vote and the share of thepopulation older than 65: These controls capture age patterns within each municipality. Accordingto Rama et al. (2021), vote for VOX should be younger than that of other parties, even thoughthe average voter is aged 35-55.• Turnout: Usually associated in the literature with the idea of protest vote (assuming a negativerelationship with radical right support).• Vote for the mainstream right (the People’s Party, or PP) in the 2016 national election: Thisvariable tries to capture the degree to which a particular municipality leans towards a right-wingideology.21• Regional controls: This set of dummies aims to account for long-standing institutional and culturaldifferences across Spanish regions.6. Z ′m stands for a vector of socio-demographic controls associated with the ‘reality’ of each of the sidesof the debate. More specifically it includes:• Unemployment rate: Associated with the economic anxiety argument. Higher rates of unemploy-ment should, in principle, favor the radical right (see Algan et al. 2017).• Share of foreigners: Acting as a proxy for the cultural backlash hypothesis. Arguably, municipal-ities with more foreigners should see more radical right support.• Change in regional GDP share between 1955 an 2019: This control – unfortunately only availableat the provincial level – shows the evolution in the weight that a given region plays within theoverall Spanish economy. The idea is that provinces that lost economic importance since 1955should be more prone to vote for VOX.Table 2 includes the results for the baseline OLS specifications. I introduce relevant regressors in astep-wise fashion to be able to compare model performance. Column (1) begins with the simplest approach:it sets up a model that aims to predict the vote for VOX based on the different (relevant) narratives aswell as some basic demographic and voting statistics. Reading the table from left to right adds layers ofcomplexity 6. Column (2) includes key demographics as well as the main proxies available to account forthe ‘reality’ of the key sides of the debate. Column (3) is the preferred specification, combining the previoustwo approaches. Columns (4) and (5) are robustness checks: they try to account for the ideology inherentto each municipality by adding a control for earlier vote in favor of the mainstream right.Let’s start with the discussion of some key socio-demographic controls. A first striking element, incontrast with evidence from other European countries (e.g. Stockemer 2016), is that the coefficient of thenatural logarithm of population density is positive 7. This result holds across all specifications. Indeed, therise of the radical right in Spain is not limited to rural areas. In fact, VOX obtained an average vote of 14.8%across all Spanish cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants, a percentage that is not statistically differentfrom the national average of 15%.6All variables in Table 2 – other than population density – should be read as percentages, with 1% being included in the dataas 1 rather than as 0.01. Therefore, the first coefficient in Column (1), for example, should be read as: a 1-percentage-point(p.p.) increase in the share of local articles about unemployment and poverty is associated with a rise in support for VOX of0.14 p.p.For an intuitive sense of coefficient size, refer to Annex A, which includes the 28 different topics across which the algorithmclassified tweets and their average prevalence across the whole of Spain.7A specification that includes instead controls for the logarithm of population along with a rural/urban dummy leads toinsignificant results in the latter, as in Turnbull-Dugarte et al. (2020).22Table 2: Baseline OLS regressionsDependent variable:VOX vote share(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)Unemp. & poverty 0.144∗∗ 0.124∗ 0.250∗∗∗ 0.224∗∗∗(0.073) (0.073) (0.067) (0.067)Religion 0.068 0.041 0.020 0.016(0.092) (0.091) (0.084) (0.084)Immigration −0.525∗∗∗ −0.336∗ −0.254 −0.166(0.194) (0.194) (0.178) (0.178)Feminism & LGBTQ+ 0.076 0.170 0.461∗∗∗ 0.477∗∗∗(0.194) (0.193) (0.178) (0.178)Regional gaps 0.408∗∗∗ 0.398∗∗∗ −0.022 −0.019(0.131) (0.130) (0.121) (0.120)Lack of resources −0.416∗∗∗ −0.312∗∗∗ −0.097 −0.066(0.115) (0.115) (0.106) (0.106)Separatism 0.437∗∗∗ 0.586∗∗∗ 0.515∗∗∗ 0.571∗∗∗(0.116) (0.117) (0.106) (0.107)Pop. density (log) 0.308∗∗∗ 0.284∗∗∗ 0.258∗∗∗ 0.357∗∗∗ 0.312∗∗∗(0.054) (0.054) (0.055) (0.049) (0.051)Voting-age pop. under 35 0.063∗∗∗ 0.056∗∗∗ 0.039∗ 0.037∗ 0.021(0.021) (0.021) (0.021) (0.020) (0.020)Pop. over 65 −0.134∗∗∗ −0.125∗∗∗ −0.133∗∗∗ −0.233∗∗∗ −0.232∗∗∗(0.011) (0.011) (0.011) (0.010) (0.010)Turnout −0.081∗∗∗ −0.067∗∗∗ −0.073∗∗∗ −0.096∗∗∗ −0.089∗∗∗(0.010) (0.010) (0.010) (0.009) (0.009)Unemp. share −0.004 −0.023 0.017(0.016) (0.016) (0.015)Foreign share 0.093∗∗∗ 0.098∗∗∗ 0.053∗∗∗(0.010) (0.011) (0.010)∆ GDP share (1955-2019) 0.317∗∗∗ 0.291∗∗ 0.179(0.119) (0.125) (0.115)PP vote share (2016) 0.232∗∗∗ 0.229∗∗∗(0.006) (0.006)Regional controls Yes Yes Yes Yes YesObservations 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129R2 0.496 0.495 0.501 0.577 0.578Adjusted R2 0.494 0.494 0.499 0.575 0.577Note: ∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.0123In contrast, the age coefficients do align with earlier literature. Rama et al. (2021) points out that,while not the most popular party among the youngest voters, a sizeable proportion of this demographicchose to vote for the radical right. Consistently with this finding, Table 2 shows that municipalities withyounger (eligible-to-vote) populations were more likely to display stronger levels of support for VOX. Theopposite was true of older municipalities – with an effect that is both quite strong and significant across allspecifications.One may see the support for VOX as a form of protest vote. The negative turnout coefficient would seemto support this view. Negative turnout coefficients have been cited in the literature as an argument in favorof the idea that citizens vote for the radical right in protest against mainstream parties rather than becausethey stand behind radical right values (Smets and van Ham, 2013).Column (1) then includes estimations for the key parameters of interest: the coefficients for each ofthe narratives. Overall, I find clear evidence in favor of both the economic anxiety and separatism camps.The results also show partial confirmation of the geography of discontent hypothesis. Support in favor ofcultural backlash is more limited, being largely washed out when controlling for local age profiles. The nextparagraphs provide more detail on each of these results.As expected, perceived economic deprivation fosters radical right support. The coefficient for the share oflocal articles dealing with unemployment and poverty remains positive and significant across all specifications.Furthermore, the narrative appears to have an effect beyond the reality of local unemployment. Addingcontrols for the actual unemployment rate – see Column (3), for instance – does not provide significantresults, while the narrative coefficient remains significant throughout.The role of cultural backlash is less clear. As is perhaps to be expected, the inclusion of controls for localdemographics does away with most of the cultural effects. As a result, all specifications show that localnarratives about religion do not appear to play a role in RRP support. In the case of immigration, the effectdrops in significance as one adds controls; it also features the opposite sign than was initially theorized. Thisis surprising, given the key role that immigration plays in VOX’s rhetoric (Rama et al., 2021). However, itshould be noted that the actual share of migrants in a location does appear to foster support for the radicalright – see Column (3). The pattern found in immigration is therefore the opposite of the one found foreconomic anxiety: in this case reality seems to trump the effect of the narrative.For its part, feminism & LGBTQ+ issues only appear relevant to the vote in favor of VOX when con-trolling for local right-wing ideology. And, in that case, the topic was associated with higher, rather thanlower, levels of support for the radical right. This result, while initially surprising, can easily be explainedby a shortcoming of the current methodology. The algorithm correctly classifies tweets by topic; it, however,24does not capture the sentiment conveyed in the tweet. In the case of the feminism & LGBTQ+ category, asizeable proportion of the articles either use polarizing language or completely deride rather than supportliberal values 8. This suggests that the feminism & LGBTQ+ category topic should instead be interpretedas a measure of social conservatism.The results also provide some evidence in favor of the geography of discontent hypothesis. A higher shareof articles about the prevalence of regional gaps was indeed associated to better voting outcomes for theRRP VOX. In contrast, municipalities with more articles dedicated to a lack of resources invested in an areawere less likely to support the radical right. Much of the benefit from these feelings seems to have accruedto the mainstream right rather than to VOX. These results are robust to the inclusion of a control to proxyfor the real long-run (1955-2019) performance of different provinces. In contrast, controlling for the localvote for the mainstream right in 2016 does away with these effects, a fact that suggests that the People’sParty was capitalizing on these issues before the advent of VOX.Finally, we come to the importance of narratives about separatism in driving VOX’s support, a hypothesisfirst proposed in Turnbull-Dugarte (2019). The evidence in this case is unequivocal: the local share of articleson separatist issues is strongly linked to support for the radical right in Spain. This finding is robust to anychanges in the econometric specification – see Columns (1) and (3)-(5). The placebo tests included in AnnexC reinforce this same idea: talk of separatist issues benefitted the radical right exclusively, with Podemos,PSOE and PP all featuring effects in the opposite direction.The reader may be also be wondering about the model performance of narratives compared to moretraditional socio-economic controls. A quick comparison of the R2 between columns (1) and (2) wouldinitially suggest there is not much of an advantage in using narratives. In reality, the similarity of goodness-of-fit measures in this case owes exclusively to the inclusion of regional controls. Of course, regional controlsare necessary in these setting to account for the very important and long-standing institutional, historical,and cultural differences between all Spanish regions. However, models clean of any other controls show anadjusted R2 of 0.26 for the narratives compared to 0.11 for the ‘hard statistics’. This indicates two things:1) the narratives are very regionalized in nature, to the point that almost all of the effect can be absorbed bythe regional dummies; however, 2) tracking narratives can help to explain elements that are very important8See, for example, the following negative tweet: ‘Mendez de Vigo about the 8M [demonstrations] Some preach and the restof us actually provide’. There are also plenty of examples of polarizing articles: ‘Opinion mlopezcastro1 writes about the sexistpoem dedicated to Irene Montero [prominent politician affiliated to the radical-left party Podemos]’.The challenge in generating a classification that reliably identifies both topic and sentiment is complicated by the choiceof Spain as a country of study. The development of sentiment classification algorithms is largely focused on English, withvery limited options in Spanish. In addition, out of the alternatives available, many rely on literal translation from English(Osorio Angel et al., 2021). This makes implementation more difficult – especially on on cultural topics, where journalists oftenemploy irony as a mode of communication. For this reason, improvements on the algorithm are left to future work.25in driving the vote but that would otherwise just be ascribed to inherent regional differences. In other words,a text analysis approach provides insight into the ‘why’ behind regional differences in the vote.6.2 A spatial approachThe simpler OLS model does not take spatial spillovers into consideration. It would only be natural to thinkthat narratives spread more easily between contiguous municipalities. If this is true, then the necessaryassumption that neighboring observations are independent from each other is violated. To overcome thisproblem, I make use of spatial econometric techniques. Following LeSage (2014), I consider a nested spatial(Manski) model with the following structure:y = ρWy +Xβ +WXθ + uu = λWu+ ϵ,where the dependent variable and Xβ matrix are the same as in the OLS version above 9. In all cases,W is a queen matrix of spatial weights, where the mean number of neighbors equals 6. The model allowsfor local spillovers to neighboring municipalities through a matrix of spatially lagged topic densities (WX,which for simplicity is constructed using average values). WY represents the average vote share in favorof VOX across a given municipality’s neighbors. Notice that this allows for global effects, since a changein the vote for VOX in a given municipality would generate a feedback loop that could potentially affectall municipalities, establishing a new equilibrium in the long run. Finally, Wu stands for spatially laggedresiduals. ρ, θ, and λ are, along with β, coefficients to be estimated.Elhorst (2014) explains in detail how different types of spatial econometric models are nested within theManski model. Given the difficulty in estimating all parameters at once, he also proposes some tests – to usealongside theoretical understanding of the subject – to work out which of the nested models is best suitedto a given research question. In this sense, there is a key difference between local and global models: thedistinction owing to whether endogenous interaction and feedback effects between spatial units are present(LeSage, 2014). Given the nature of political choices, I lean towards a local model. This is because one caneasily think of voting outcomes and narratives affecting nearby municipalities, but it seems unlikely thatchanges in voting shares in a single municipality could spread through a feedback loop across the wholecountry. This insight then points towards using the Spatial Durbin Error model (SDEM) as a starting point(where ρ = 0 in the system of equations outlined above). Alternative options include the Spatial ErrorModel (SEM, where ρ = 0 and θ = 0), the Spatially Lagged X model (SLX, where ρ = 0 and λ = 0 instead),9In fact, OLS is the simplest version nested within the Manski model.26and OLS (where all ρ, θ, and λ are set to 0), all of which are special cases of SDEM.Table 3: Results from the Spatial Error Durbin ModelDependent variable:VOX vote shareOLS SLX SEM SDEM(1) (2) (3) (4)λ 0.36951∗∗∗ 0.35364∗∗∗Unemp. & poverty 0.124∗ 0.120∗ 0.125 0.241(0.073) (0.218) (0.074) (0.232)Religion 0.041 0.028 0.038 0.041(0.091) (0.260) (0.128) (0.287)Immigration −0.336∗ 0.978∗∗ −0.490∗ 0.677(0.194) (0.486) (0.269) (0.577)Feminism & LGBTQ+ 0.170 0.517 0.213 0.527(0.193) (0.408) (0.267) (0.568)Regional gaps 0.398∗∗∗ −0.874∗∗ 0.329∗ −0.805∗∗(0.130) (0.365) (0.182) (0.407)Lack of resources −0.312∗∗∗ 0.240 −0.272∗ 0.060(0.115) (0.260) (0.159) (0.346)Separatism 0.586∗∗∗ 0.368∗∗ 0.500∗∗∗ −0.136(0.117) (0.154) (0.160) (0.345)Unemp. share −0.023 0.016 −0.031∗ −0.032∗(0.016) (0.020) (0.017) (0.017)Foreign share 0.098∗∗∗ 0.082∗∗∗ 0.082∗∗∗ 0.078∗∗∗(0.011) (0.015) (0.012) (0.012)∆ GDP share (1955-2019) 0.129∗∗∗ −0.015 0.100∗∗∗ 0.083(0.023) (0.024) (0.032) (0.070)Socio-demographic controls Yes Yes Yes YesSpatial lags No Yes No YesObservations 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129(Pseudo) R2 0.499 0.385 0.515 0.515AIC 51,384.4 51,465.7LR test (p-value) < 0.001 0.2276Note: ∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.01The main goal in comparing these models is to find a stable econometric specification that can lead27to evidence in favor or against each of the sides of the economic anxiety - cultural backlash - geography ofdiscontent - separatism debate. I use maximum likelihood (ML) to run the estimations and follow the modelselection process outlined in Elhorst (2014). AIC and Likelihood Ratio tests point in the direction of SEM,although I report all nested local models in Table 3 for completeness.The general results are very much in line with what has already been outlined in the previous subsection10. But this paper also aims to uncover any evidence of spatial spillovers in the relationship between narrativesand the vote in favor of the radical right. The key parameter of interest here is λ – also referred to as aspatial autocorrelation coefficient. This term features in the preferred specification in column (3), as well asmodel (4). It captures the effect of any shocks to the residuals of a municipality’s neighbors. Lambda, inother words, stands for any situation where unobserved shocks follow a spatial pattern, or where unobserveddeterminants of the vote for VOX are spatially autocorrelated. It could be interpreted, for instance, as aspatial pattern of right-wing political ideology. As expected, there is a strong positive spatial dependence inthe data. Despite this, the sign and significance of the coefficients does not change with respect to the OLSspecification.7 ConclusionThis paper contributes to the political and regional literature on the reasons behind the rising wave of supportfor RRPs. I provide empirical evidence for the main theoretical explanations on the rise of the radical rightin Spain and seek to discern the relative importance of economic and regional arguments compared to apotential cultural backlash against globalization and modernization. I also take into account relevant localpolitical theories, analyzing the role played by local perceptions regarding separatist movements. To do so, Itake advantage of a simple idea: that geographical differences in newspaper reporting reflect local narratives,and therefore understanding these can help us determine which issues drive local voting patterns.The focus on narratives is important. The vast majority of studies in quantitative political geographyassume that perceptions closely track socioeconomic statistics. I show some evidence against this pieceof conventional wisdom. One of the main contributions of this paper lies in the new use of text data todetermine the equilibrium of voter preferences in a given location. To gauge these preferences, I apply awell-known machine learning algorithm to news information mined from Twitter. I then use the aggregatedresults to calculate the prevalence of news topics by municipality. Based on this new dataset, I first try to10Note that the interpretation of the marginal effects in the SLX and SDEM models requires the joining of each of thecoefficients and the lags. Table 3 shows the direct marginal effects. A table including the breakdown by direct and indirecteffects from those (non-preferred) models is available as an external appendix.28understand whether newspaper coverage of an issue matches reality. I am able to make comparisons withtopics related to unemployment, immigration, and long-term population and economic decline. The findingssuggest that views on cultural and economic matters poorly reflect socioeconomic statistics. In contrast,perceptions on regional issues are much better aligned with reality.The mismatch between perceptions and reality suggests that the use of quantitative text analysis con-stitutes a necessary complement to already existing research. Of course, one key difficulty lies in the factthat the disconnect between reality and what people believe is likely to play out differently across differentcontexts. It also need not remain constant over time. Ideally, one would want to track narratives overtime and space, as this would provide much better insights on which topics drive RRP vote. This articleconstitutes but a first step in that direction.This paper also pays special attention to the spatial variation in radical right vote. It follows Essletzbichleret al. (2021) in testing for spatial spillovers where the literature usually focuses on a-spatial analysis. Thishelps to reduce some relevant concerns about omitted variable bias. In fact, the inclusion of unobservedlocal spillover effects substantially improves the fit of the model, better accounting for the strong positivespatial dependence between unobservables.The results of the preferred Spatial Error Model (SEM) shed some light onto the economic-regional-cultural backlash debate. I find evidence for three of the four explanations of radical right support: jour-nalistic accounts of unemployment and poverty, regional gaps, and separatist movements were all positivelyassociated with the radical right’s electoral success. Nonetheless, there are some caveats. Cultural factorsdo not appear as influential as economic and regional forces in driving the vote once one controls for localdemographics. This is in large part due to the effect of feminism and LGBTQ+ issues, which tilt the balancein favor rather than against the radical right. Upon scrutiny, I find this surprising result owes to the fact thatmany of the articles that talk about women and LGBTQ+ issues do so in a negative tone. The algorithm iscurrently unable to distinguish between both groups. In addition, complaints over lack of resources did notfuel the rise of VOX. They favored the mainstream right (Partido Popular) instead.A final disclaimer. The empirical specification used in this article need not reflect causal effects. Nonethe-less, research in the fields of marketing, education and psychology, among others, indicate that people respondvery strongly to changing narratives. Yet, unequivocal proof is hard to come by: local narratives and votingpatterns are likely to be intertwined in ways we may never be able to account for. Despite this, I hope thatearlier references to research on this topic in the fields of human geography, psychology, and political science,as well as the use of a new methodology that uses quantitative text analysis in an attempt to understandlocal narratives, have served to convince the reader that the approach is an interesting one that warrants29further exploration. Future work should focus on tracking narratives over time and complementing the topicmodels with sentiment analysis.30A Annex ATable 4: List of topics used to program the Naive Bayes algorithmTopics Debate position Mean topic prevalence1 Agriculture and farming NA 2.4%2 Business NA 3.7%3 Crime & accidents NA 7.8%4 Culture NA 3.9%5 Economy NA 3.9%6 Education NA 3.7%7 Entertainment NA 4.0%8 Environment NA 2.9%9 Feminism and LGBTQ+ Cultural backlash 2.9%10 Health NA 3.6%11 Holidays and celebrations NA 1.9%12 Infrastructure & urban planning NA 3.8%13 Immigration Cultural backlash 3.6%14 International NA 3.6%15 Lack of resources Geography of discontent 3.2%16 Local business NA 1.8%17 Local government NA 3.3%18 National politics NA 3.9%19 Poverty & unemployment Economic argument 3.8%20 Regional gaps Geography of discontent 2.5%21 Regional politics NA 3.9%22 Religion Cultural backlash 3.7%23 Separatism NA 3.6%24 Society & gossip NA 3.8%25 Sports NA 4.0%26 Science & technology NA 3.5%27 Tourism NA 3.6%28 Weather NA 3.7%31B Annex BTable 6: Does previous vote for the far right predict topic densities in 2018?Dependent variable:Unemployment Regional Lack of& poverty Feminism Immigration Religion gaps resources(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)Pop. density (log) 0.159∗∗∗ −0.081∗∗∗ 0.072∗∗∗ −0.240∗∗∗ −0.048∗∗∗ 0.129∗∗∗(0.018) (0.011) (0.009) (0.026) (0.015) (0.017)Voters under 35 0.012 0.009∗∗ −0.022∗∗∗ 0.036∗∗∗ −0.023∗∗∗ 0.101∗∗∗(0.007) (0.005) (0.004) (0.011) (0.006) (0.007)Pop. over 65 0.017∗∗∗ 0.005∗ −0.010∗∗∗ −0.003 0.012∗∗∗ 0.048∗∗∗(0.004) (0.002) (0.002) (0.006) (0.003) (0.004)Rad. right (2016) −0.008 −0.015 −0.098∗∗∗ −0.069 −0.056 −0.236∗∗∗(0.041) (0.025) (0.021) (0.061) (0.035) (0.039)Observations 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129R2 0.070 0.035 0.039 0.086 0.215 0.089Adjusted R2 0.070 0.035 0.038 0.085 0.214 0.089Note: ∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.0132C Annex CTable 7: Placebo testsDependent variable:Podemos PSOE PP VOX(1) (2) (3) (4)Unemp. & poverty 0.201∗∗∗ 0.431∗∗∗ −0.432∗∗∗ 0.144∗∗(0.060) (0.115) (0.107) (0.073)Religion −0.173∗∗ −0.154 −0.072 0.068(0.076) (0.145) (0.135) (0.092)Immigration 0.452∗∗∗ 1.058∗∗∗ 0.017 −0.525∗∗∗(0.160) (0.306) (0.284) (0.194)Feminism & LGBTQ+ 0.258 2.411∗∗∗ −0.444 0.076(0.160) (0.306) (0.284) (0.194)Regional gaps −0.664∗∗∗ −1.654∗∗∗ 0.919∗∗∗ 0.408∗∗∗(0.108) (0.207) (0.192) (0.131)Lack of resources 0.303∗∗∗ 1.081∗∗∗ −1.055∗∗∗ −0.416∗∗∗(0.095) (0.182) (0.169) (0.115)Separatism −0.414∗∗∗ −0.653∗∗∗ −0.739∗∗∗ 0.437∗∗∗(0.096) (0.183) (0.170) (0.116)Pop. density (log) 0.513∗∗∗ 0.474∗∗∗ −0.024 0.308∗∗∗(0.045) (0.085) (0.079) (0.054)Voting-age pop. under 35 −0.188∗∗∗ 0.167∗∗∗ −0.018 0.063∗∗∗(0.018) (0.034) (0.031) (0.021)Pop. over 65 −0.199∗∗∗ 0.097∗∗∗ 0.389∗∗∗ −0.134∗∗∗(0.009) (0.017) (0.016) (0.011)Turnout −0.044∗∗∗ −0.054∗∗∗ 0.105∗∗∗ −0.081∗∗∗(0.008) (0.016) (0.015) (0.010)Observations 8,129 8,129 8,129 8,129R2 0.290 0.483 0.698 0.495Adjusted R2 0.288 0.482 0.697 0.493Note: ∗p<0.1; ∗∗p<0.05; ∗∗∗p<0.0133ReferencesAIMC (2016).

    "abstract": "Rising support for the radical right has become a hallmark of the current political landscape. A lot of attention has been devoted to the reasons influencing individual voting decisions, with some progress in understanding within-country variation in the vote. But these studies usually assume that perceptions coincide with objective reality. This article addresses this shortcoming, using quantitative text analysis and spatial econometrics to show that local narratives – sometimes more than contextual statistics – can drive spatial differences in the populist vote. Taking Spain as an example, I train a machine learning algorithm to determine the prevalence of given news topics across the national territory based on how many related articles local newspapers published on Twitter in the year before the last national election. I then use spatial econometric techniques to link these results to local divergences in support for the radical right party VOX. The analysis sheds some light onto the economic anxiety - cultural backlash - geography of discontent debate. The empirical evidence supports the notion that narratives about economic anxiety and regional gaps matter, but also shows that narratives about separatism played a key role in the rise of the radical right in Spain",
