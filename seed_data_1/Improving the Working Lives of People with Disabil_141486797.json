About 10 years ago, I was \napproached by researchers working at the \nEmployment and Disability Institute about \ncollaborating on a research project. I had \nalready begun my research on diversity \nand inclusion but, like many other diversity \nresearchers, had focused primarily on issues \nrelated to race and gender in organisations. \nI knew nothing about disabilities and was \ninterested in expanding my lens.  \nAt the time (and this is still largely true), \nmuch of the published research focused on \nthe individual employment experiences of \npeople with disabilities working across a wide \nvariety of organisations. What we planned \nto do together was somewhat different – we \nwanted to do a “deep dive” into organisations \nand collect data not just from individuals \nwith disabilities, but also their co-workers, \nmanagers and senior leaders so that we could \ndevelop a more nuanced understanding of \nhow the work experiences of individuals with \ndisabilities are impacted by the social context \nand relationships at work.   \nWere there any major roadblocks to gaining \nfunding for this project?\nPeople might be surprised to learn that social \nscience research can be expensive. We would \nnot have been able to conduct our ongoing \nresearch projects without the generous funding \nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices.  \nWere there any other complications you \nexperienced while conducting your research?\nUnfortunately, we often face complications \nwhile conducting research. For instance, \nalthough we always assure respondents of the \nconfidentiality of their responses, we usually \nprefer to be able to track survey responses \nto particular individuals. However, in one of \nour studies, we ended up needing to conduct \nan anonymous survey in which we could not \nidentify individual respondents. We prefer to \nbe able to identify respondents not because \nwe care which individuals have said what, \nbut because this is the only way we can then \nlink survey data to other data sources once \nwe start analysis. By having to make the \nsurvey anonymous (based on our partner \norganisation’s requests), we lost our ability \nto link employee responses to those of their \nspecific supervisors as well as with HR data, \nwhich was unfortunate.\nAnother common complication that we face \nrelates to survey response rates. Low response \nrates can bring a number of limitations to \nthe research. It becomes difficult to know \nwhether the respondents who have completed \nthe survey are representative of the broader \nworkforce. In addition, survey response rates \nalso dictate the type of analyses that are \npossible. In the case of one of our studies which \ninvolved social network analyses, we were \nunable to construct complete models of the \nsocial networks within the organisation due \nto low response rates. Instead, we focused our \nanalyses on egocentric networks or people’s \nreports of their own social networks.\nThis means that respondents answered \nquestions about the individuals at work \nthey consider to be friends, key sources of \ninformation and/or mentors, as well as the \ndemographic background of these individuals. \nImproving the working lives of \npeople with disabilities\nDr. Lisa Nishii studies and conducts research that is focused on how to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. She has conducted \nmultiple studies that focus on workplace outcomes for persons with disabilities (PWDs).\nINEQUALITY IN THE WORKPLACE\nManaging workplace relationships is a daunting \ntask for many people. For persons with \ndisabilities (PWDs), this task is even harder. \nPWDs are chronically un-employed and under-\nemployed. According to the U.S. Census Bureau- \nIn the year 2012, an estimated 34% of people \nwith disabilities were employed, compared to \n72% of people without disabilities. PWDs who \nare employed earn, on average, 72 cents to \nthe dollar, and face higher risks of being fired. \nThey are also less likely to be given job-related \ntraining. The Americans with Disabilities Act \nwas passed in 1990 to provide equitable access \nto the workplace for people with disabilities. \nDespite this, many managers do not understand \nthe policies and practices in place for helping \nemployees who have disabilities. Some \ndisabilities are not readily apparent, and this \noften leaves PWDs in the position of deciding \nwhether or not to disclose that information to \nan employer. They worry that disclosure will \ncause others to expect less of them, not take \nthem seriously or isolate them from social \nnetworks in the workplace. Some may simply \nnot disclose because their disabilities and their \ntasks at work are often unrelated. Although \nnot disclosing might protect individuals with \ndisabilities from being discriminated against \ndue to their disabilities, not disclosing can \ncome at a cost, in particular the emotional \ntoll of constantly and consistently hiding their \ndisabilities. The work of Dr. Nishii provides new \ninformation that can address the many factors \nthat complicate the lives of so many.\nA NEW ERA OF DISABILITY RESEARCH\nOne challenge faced by researchers who study \nthe workplace relationships of PWDs is the \ncurrent body of research that is available. Most \nprevious research conducted on this topic \nconsisted of small-scale studies that primarily \nused other people’s perceptions of PWD instead \nof PWDs’ own experiences in the workplace. \nThere are several reasons for this. First, \nemployees who do not report their disability \nstatus may be excluded from the research. Since \nSophisticated Research Method \nProvides New Insights\nThe Employment and Disability Institute of Cornell asked Dr. Lisa Nishii to use her training as an organisational psychologist to research ways \nto improve the workplace experience of individuals with disabilities.\ndisability status can change over time with the \naging process or progressive conditions, people \ndon’t necessarily see themselves as being a \nperson with a disability and also disability \nstatus can change from year to year. Lastly, the \nvast diversity of disabilities should be included \nin research for accurate representation in \naddressing the issues of workplace equality.\nWhat we planned to do together \nwas somewhat different – we \nwanted to do a “deep dive” into \norganisations and collect data \nnot just from individuals with \ndisabilities, but also their co-\nworkers, managers and senior \nleaders so that we could develop \na more nuanced understanding \nof how the work experiences of \nindividuals with disabilities are \nimpacted by the social context \nand relationships at work.\nOrganisations that work to improve diversity \nand inclusion in professional environments \nhave long focused on race and gender, and \nonly now are they turning their attention to \nPWDs. This has led to new opportunities for \nresearchers like Nishii. Nishii addresses this \ndearth of information by conducting multi-\nlevel studies, a type of study design with which \nshe is very familiar and has used frequently in \nthe past. Multi-level analyses are capable of \nelucidating the relationships among higher-\nlevel constructs and lower-level constructs. \nIn this case, high-level constructs include \nmanagerial behaviour or workgroup climate, \nand low-level constructs include the individual-\nlevel experiences of employees working in \nthese workgroups. These research methods are \ncomplex, but are becoming more common with \nthe development of increasingly sophisticated \nstatistical software packages that can \naccommodate the computational requirements \ninvolved. Using this method, Nishii was \nable to examine the individual relationships \nThey also shared information about the \nquality of their relationships with each of these \nindividuals. Although we couldn’t tell from \nthis egocentric network data which individuals \nwere most central in the social networks of the \norganisation, we were still able to learn how \npeople’s relationships at work are affected by \nthe inclusiveness of their work environment. \nIndividuals working in inclusive groups not \nonly have more demographically dissimilar \nindividuals in their networks, but they also \nhave fewer negative interactions with dissimilar \nothers. Being able to show this in our social \nnetwork data is really important because it is \nthese negative interactions that are particularly \nharmful when it comes to people’s satisfaction \nand engagement at work. When, in diverse \nwork contexts (which almost all are nowadays), \nmanagers fail to foster inclusive norms, people \ntend to experience more conflict particularly \nwith dissimilar others. This conflict drives down \nthe engagement and performance of groups \nand increases turnover. \nYou used a complicated and many-faceted \nstudy design in order to adequately assess \nwhat is a complex topic. Was the planning \nand preparation for this project more \narduous than for others you have done in the \npast?\nThis type of study design is the norm for \nthe kind of research that I do in which I link \ninformation about the adoption of specific \norganisational practices and the social context \nof work (i.e. workgroup climate, group norms, \nleadership, etc.) with employee experiences \nand employment outcomes. These research \nmodels necessarily involve data collected from \nmultiple sources: HR information systems, \norganisational leaders, HR representatives, line \nmanagers and employees, often at multiple \npoints in time. \nbetween different people and workgroups in an \norganisation and how those relationships are \naffected by workplace practices and culture, as \nwell as how those relationships affect outcomes \nfor individual employees and the workplace as \na whole.\nFINDING THE ANSWER\nIn a study for the Employer Practices Related \nto Individuals with Disabilities Rehabilitation \nResearch and Training Center (see www. \nemployerpracticesrrtc.org), Nishii and her \ncolleagues conducted interviews with senior \nmanagers in various HR departments as well \nas with managers and supervisors. These \ninterviews gave her insight into the barriers to \nsuccess that senior managers feel those with \ndisabilities face. In addition, she conducted \nfocus groups with those with disabilities \nabout their workplace experiences in order to \ndetermine what barriers they thought were \ndetrimental to their success. Researchers \nsought opinions on how well their organisation \nrecruits, engages, and retains employees with \ndisabilities, and what other complications \nResearcher \nProfile\nSCIENTI A\nthey faced on a daily basis. They also obtained \ninformation from employees without disabilities \nwho work closely with those with disabilities. \nNishii found that co-workers’ reaction to \nrequesting accommodations was a large factor \nin how inclusive employees with disabilities \nperceive their work environments to be. \nSeparate focus groups were also conducted to \nidentify how supervisor attitudes can facilitate \nor create barriers to effective accommodations \nfor people with disabilities.\nUsing the information obtained from interviews \nand focus groups, Nishii then developed a \nsurvey. Examining the results of individual-\nlevel employee experiences, Nishii found that, \noverall, employees with disabilities report less \nfavourable experiences at work: for example, in \nterms of being treated fairly, feeling supported, \nhaving a high quality relationship with one’s \nsupervisor, receiving adequate performance \nfeedback, and perceiving opportunities for \nadvancement. The survey also revealed \nthat only 58.6 per cent of employees with \ndisabilities shared their disability status \nwith supervisors. Rates of disclosure to HR \ndepartments are even lower at a mere 12.2 per \ncent. Employees with emotional and mental \ndisabilities are the least likely to disclose that \ninformation, with only 38.5 percent disclosure \nto supervisors. Individual-level responses \nalso provided information as to when and \nwhy accommodations are requested, and \nmore importantly, when and why they are \nnot requested. Those with physical and vision \nimpairments are the most likely to request \naccommodations, with slightly fewer requests \nbeing made by those with chronic health, \nmental and emotional, cognitive and hearing \ndisabilities. The accommodations requested \nmost frequently were changes related to \nwork tasks and job structure or schedule. \nOther requests included physical changes to \nthe workplace, new or modified equipment \nand changes in policy or communication \npractices. Few employees with disabilities \ndid not request an accommodation that they \nneeded, out of fear that it might affect their \nfuture opportunities or change their manager’s \nopinion of them.\nThe experiences of PWDs, as well as their \nwillingness to disclose their disability status, \nvary significantly depending on their immediate \nwork environment. The most important \ncontributions from Nishii’s research involve \ninsights about the factors that predict the \nquality of PWD’s work experiences. Surprisingly, \nnearly three-quarters of managers are not \naware of the disability policies and practices in\nplace within their organisations, and yet this \nawareness is critical. The more managers \nare aware of their organisation’s disability \npractices and think that they are effective, and \nthe more they perceive that senior leaders \nare committed to disability issues, the better \nthey are at fostering work environments that \nare inclusive of PWDs. Their data show that \nmanagers who believe in the strategic benefits \nof disability initiatives implement disability \npractices in ways that promote better outcomes \nfor PWDs than managers who think that \ndisability initiatives are adopted purely for legal \ncompliance purposes. These better outcomes \ninclude having a positive experience when \nrequesting an accommodation, feeling more \ncomfortable about disclosing one’s disability, \nand being treated well and fairly by co-workers \neven after disclosing one’s disability.\nNishii also finds that PWDs who have a good \nworking relationship with their supervisor, \nor have a mentor within the organisation, \nexperience less disability-related bias within \ntheir work groups. Also, to the extent that \nPWDs have what they need to be effective in \ntheir jobs, the less bias they experience. PWDs \nwhose skills are well matched to their job, \nreceive adequate socialisation when they first \nenter a job, and receive adequate performance \nfeedback feel less socially isolated because \nof their disability. These important, novel \ncontributions to the literature will enhance \nfuture research on the work experiences of \npersons with disabilities as well as vastly \nimprove the work lives of many people.\nDr. Lisa Nishii\nHuman Resources Studies Department\nCornell University School of Industrial and Labor \nRelations\nDr. Lisa Nishii was educated at Wellesley College \nand received her Ph.D. from the University of \nMaryland.
