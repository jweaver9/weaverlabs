From behavioral health issues, to violence issues, to increased rates ofhomelessness, structural stigma impacts LGBTQ communities at adisproportionate rate. Suicide numbers are particularly concerning. he LGBcommunity rate of suicide is two to three times that of the general population.For the transgender and nonbinary community, that number soars to nearly ninetimes that of the general population. In this article, we examine the socialdeterminates ofhealth impacting the LGBTQ community and the ways structuralstigma supports health inequity. Given the health data, the article analyzes howpolicymakers could include an explicit rationale in antidiscrimination laws toshift social norms and lower stigma in pursuit of improving population health.Even when a policy is anti-discriminatory on its face, naming the intent ofshifting norms and lowering stigma matter. When the explicit rationale isnamed, it can serve two purposes: 1) articulating a clearpublic health purposeof the antidiscrimination law and 2) educating the public on the needfor normchange and its public health impact. Making it clear that the goal ofsocial normchange is to protect and improve the population's health may make the state'scompelling state interest case stronger, particularly in the face of ReligiousFreedom Restoration Acts, in challenges to antidiscrimination laws.* Heather A.

INTRODUCTIONThe lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (inclusive of nonbinary), and queer(collectively, LGBTQ) community is experiencing suicide at alarming rates.2The LGB community rate of suicide is two to three times that of the generalpopulation.3 For the transgender and nonbinary community, that number soarsto nearly nine times that of the general population.4 Research supports thatstigma is a structural determinant of health that contributes to harmful mentaland physical health outcomes, especially among LGBTQ communities.The public health community is increasingly examining and seeking toimpact not only the social determinants of health, but also the structuraldeterminants of health-those health disparities at the institutional and policylevels impacting communities. This is an important shift in conceptualizing theissues that may assist in making broad improvements to health inequities. Givenwhat we know about stigma, built on a strong foundation of research from publichealth, mental health, and stigma scholars, it time for public health to move onestep further.7 Generally, antidiscrimination laws move the public's behaviors1. In this article, the term LGBTQ will be used as inclusive of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,Transgender (inclusive of those who are nonbinary), and Queer or Questioning (inclusive of thosewho self-identify as queer or others who are generally included in this community but not wellcoveredby the other categories such as asexual, pansexual, genderqueer, or others). If other lettersare used, it is based on the scope of the work referenced or is an intentional discussion of only oneportion of the overall community.2. See NAT'L LGBT HEALTH EDUC.

It is time to explicitly namechanging norms towards marginalized groups as a goal of antidiscriminationlaws to improve population health.This article will be divided into four sections. First, we will examine thewealth of knowledge on LGBTQ health inequities, with a particular examinationof suicide. Second, we will discuss stigma and its role in the population healthof the LGBTQ community. Third, we will discuss the rationale for a call toincrease the inclusion of a public health purpose in LGBTQ antidiscriminationlaws. Lastly, we will examine current research projects that will assist inunderstanding the impact of law and policy on structural stigma in the LGBTQcommunity.II. BACKGROUND ON LGBTQ HEALTH INEQUITIESA. LGBTQ DemographicsLGBTQ individuals have long experienced health inequities in a variety ofareas.9 In the 2020 Healthy People agenda, the Office of Disease Prevention andHealth Promotion (ODPHP), for the first time, included a goal for improving thehealth, safety, and wellbeing of LGBT individuals. 0 The agenda recognizesareas of need for promoting the public's health.\" In 2011, the Institute ofMedicine released a report entitled he Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, andPublic Health Law, 30 J.L.

Below is abroad description of the overall health inequities experienced by this communitythat provides an understanding of the environment within which these suicidesoccur.Despite increased protection for LGBTQ individuals ensured by theAffordable Care Act, 3 one study suggests that over half of LGBTQ people inAmerica have experienced discrimination in health care, from harsh interactions,to abusive language, to the refusal of care. 4 In that study, seventy percent oftransgender and gender-nonconforming individuals experienced discrimination,including physical roughness, harsh language, refused care, and ignorance oftheir health care needs. 5 Further, ninety percent of individuals who identifiedas transgender eported experiencing barriers to care due to concerns about lackof adequately trained professions, eighty-six percent reported fear of differenttreatment, and over fifty percent expressed concerns about refusal of services.61. Behavioral HealthLGBTQ persons are at enormous risk for behavioral health issues.7Depression, anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, and substance use disorder have allbeen found to be experienced at higher rates in the LGBTQ community.\" Ofparticular concern are LGBTQ youth, who are at higher risk for mental healthconcerns, substance abuse disorders, and poor overall health than youth thantheir heterosexual and cisgender peers.9 In a 2008 study, depression, anxiety,alcohol and substance misuse were found to be experienced by the LGBTQ12.

Due to the historical use of the word \"queer\" as a derogatory term, some older LGBTQfolx do not use it. Others do. While many within the LGBTQ community have reclaimed \"queer\"as an empowering label, we have dropped the \"Q\" out of recognition that some older generationsdo not self-identify as \"queer\" in light of historical discrimination. Because use of the term \"queer\"has since shifted toward empowerment, it is thus used throughout the rest of the article.44.

STIGMA THEORY AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTA. An Overview ofStigma TheoryIf stigma is contributing to poor public health outcomes, including death,then understanding and eliminating stigma is a necessary public health aim. In1963, Ervin Goffman wrote a seminal study on stigma.107 He describes stigmaas having an attribute that is \"deeply discrediting.\"0 8 His work described howstigma created conditions for both the person and others to view the personexperiencing stigma.109 The work laid the groundwork for discussions of groupsGoffman referred to as \"normal\" and those with a \"spoiled identity.\"\"10 Theconcept of a spoiled identity follows a person through all aspects of their life,from the social to the private, and ultimately takes a toll on the day-to-day livedexperience of the person who experiences stigma.\"'Following Goffman's study, other theorists provided additional detail onhow stigma worked in communities. Phelan and Link conceptualized stigma sa five-part phenomenon: labeling, stereotyping, separation, l ss of power, andstigmatization or discrimination.112 The addition of the power component oGoffman's work has proved compelling when considering the ways that lawsare a part of, and sometimes even exacerbate, structural stigma against targetedpopulations.\"3Stigma in public health law specifically is a growing area of research. A2006 article by Bayer examines the use of stigma as a tool of public health.'\"He uses smoking as an example of how stigma toward unhealthy behaviors canwork to decrease the behavior in the population.\" Though he acknowledges theharm stigma can cause, here using the example of the gay population and HIV,he also posits that some forms may serve a public health goal even while creatingethical issues.\" 6 Following Bayer's article, Burris wrote a nuanced andthoughtful response to Bayer, reviewing the history of stigma research and its107.

[S]tigma is a barbaric form of social controlthat relies upon the most primitive and destructive of emotions. And chances arethat it won't work anyway.\"\"Goldberg has also been a prolific writer on stigma and public health law.119After synthesizing reviews of stigma research, he concludes, \"Stigma iscorrosive. It is capable of inducing intense psychosocial harm. It is a risk factorfor suicide. Even when controlling for every conceivable confounder, membersof groups subjected to persistent stigma get sicker and die quicker thancomparators. It is therefore important both as a social problem and as a healthproblem.\"120 He also discusses the ways that social policies may serve to impactstigma but cautions that more research is needed on how these policies do or donot change attitudes and behaviors, and he advocates for additional research inthis area.121B. Stigma Theory and LGBTQ Population HealthThe impacts of stigma specifically on LGBTQ populations is an importantcomponent of health inequity for the population. Meyer first discussed thisconcern in his work on Minority Stress Theory (MST).122 MST, as described byMeyer, considers the \"excess stress to which individuals from stigmatized socialcategories are exposed as a result of their social, often a minority, position.\" 23Meyer cites the work of Durkheim and the need for social norms versus a senseof normlessness as he discussed how minority stress can lead to the harms ofsuicide.124 Meyer labels three specific processes which are important to theLGBTQ community: \"(a) external, objective stressful events and conditions(chronic and acute), (b) expectations of such events and the vigilance thisexpectation requires, and (c) the internalization of negative societal attitudes.\" 25He goes on to discuss the harm that concealing one's sexual orientation cancause.126117.

Expressive Function of LawMuch has been written about an expressive theory of law, a theory thatexamines the \"statement\" made by the law, not necessarily the consequencesgiven through enforcement of the law.136 For example, Sunsteiin his work Onthe Expressive Function ofLaw, examines the ways that laws serve to changesocial norms. 37 He purports that antidiscrimination laws may be passed evenwhen the specific impact on the targeted population may be unknown, writing,\"The norm can do what the law would do at possibly much greater cost.\" 3 8 Heasserts that the laws \"signal\" what behaviors are appropriate with or withoutenforcement activity attached.13 9This type of signaling has been used in civil rights laws historically. TheCivil Rights Law of 1964 both required enforceable behavior and acted as asignal that race-based discrimination would not be tolerated.14 0 In Brown v.Board ofEducation, the Supreme Court appeared to endorse an expressive viewof the law.i 4In the case, the Court expressly discussed the psychological impactof a \"separate but equal\" approach, writing, \"[t]o separate them from others ofsimilar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of135.

As courts examine a state's ability to enact public healthlegislation under the state's police powers, the court will look at what type ofinterest the state has in enacting the measure and proposed response.4 Wesuggest that naming the goal of changing social norms and directly linking it toincreasing positive health outcomes for the impacted population may strengthenthe state's ability to show a compelling state interest where necessary. Thisconcept is discussed in more detail below.2. Public Health Purpose and Communication FunctionSince Jacobson v. Massachusetts,46 the courts have consistently held thatthe states can legitimately exercise their police powers to protect the health andwelfare of their citizens.47 Antidiscrimination laws are not new, though theirrationale has neither explicitly included a public health rationale nor beenframed as an exercise of police powers in this manner. The evidence of thenegative impacts of discrimination and stigma on LGBTQ population health iswell-documented. 14 An Institute of Medicine report on the health of gay,lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people acknowledged the impact ofdiscrimination on health as it examined MST.149 In Healthy People 2020, the142.

Verner\" wasdecided, has generally been interpreted to require a compelling state interestapplied in the least restrictive means in order for a state to substantially burdena person's religious liberty. In 1990, the Supreme Court, in Employment Divisionv. Smith, ruled that when the law is one of general applicability, the courts willrule in favor of the state as long as there is a rational relationship between thepolicy and the state's interest.\"\" Given what the legislature saw as a change incourse for the Court, though the Court sought to distinguish this case fromSherbert and other earlier rulings, Congress passed the 1993 Religious FreedomRestoration Act (RFRA).19 RFRA codified the requirements of a compellingstate interest applied in the least restrictive means for any state action150.

Given the concern that state and federal RFRA laws may be used ina way that will harm the LGBTQ community, any laws meant to protect theLGBTQ community would be well advised to do everything possible to protectagainst possible RFRA challenges.173Would the Court view a state goal of changing social norms as infringing onthe free expression of a person's religious beliefs if their beliefs go against thenorm that the state expressed? Alternatively, would it strengthen the state's case,making the change of stigma and discriminatory beliefs a more compellinginterest, if the state specifically linked the change to increase health and safetyfor the impacted group?As Sunstein reasons, constraints on government action are applicable inantidiscrimination policy as with other laws.74 He writes, \"If government triedto change social norms so as to ensure that everyone is a Christian, it wouldviolate the right to religious liberty; if government tried to change social normsso as to ensure that women occupy domestic roles, and men do not, it would169.

It is important to note that there are legitimate uses of state RFRAs that have nothing todo with the LGBTQ population. Lund discusses the concern of \"throwing out the baby with thebathwater\" writing, \"In the last five years, six more states have adopted state RFRAs, and in eachcase the Elane Photography issue was part of the debate. But Indiana was different. Now the debateseems to have nothing else left in it. One side sees Elane Photography as the raison d'tre for stateRFRAs; the other side sees it as the bte noire. But on both sides, Elane Photography is all thatmatters. An unfortunate consequence is that all the other kinds of state RFRA claims-includingthe sympathetic ones mentioned here have gotten completely lost in the shuffle. For thoseinterested in protecting free exercise without protecting the claim in Elane Photography, there areseveral options going forward. The first is the simplest and probably the best-one can, by statute,simply exclude for-profits.

There is reason tobelieve that changes in policy specifically to support changes in behavior andbeliefs can impact population health. For example, in a 2013 study, Krieger etal. examined Black infant mortality rates in relation to the abolition of Jim Crowlaws. 7 6 The study compared Black infant mortality rates in states with andwithout Jim Crow laws before and after the laws were abolished. In thelongitudinal examination of infant mortality rates, rates for Black infantsimproved in states with previous Jim Crow laws with \"no comparable temporalpatterns in Jim Crow birth cohort effects occur[ing] among White infants or...evident inBlackversusWhite comparisons within these policies.\"7 7 Morestudies of this kind will help to answer the question of correlation versuscausation in structural stigma.More research regarding the public health impact of antidiscrimination laws onthe LGBTQ community will strengthen any assertion of a public health imperative.The work of Hatzenbeuhler and other public health law scholars examining stigmawill be an important component of ensuring meaningful inclusion of effective publichealth aims in these laws.IV. POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR LGBTQ PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHA. LGBTQ Legal Epidemiology ProjectGiven the relatively recent research on measuring the health impacts of anti-stigma law in general, and on the LGBTQ community in particular, more workis left to be done. To that end, data on laws and policies impacting the LGBTQat the state and local levels will be needed. Currently, the public healthcommunity is working to increase the data collected regarding the sexualorientation and gender identity of persons on whom health outcomes data recollected.' 7 The CDC is driving this work with Healthy People 2020.179 In orderto be able to examine these data in comparison with the laws and policies, moreinformation is needed.We are working to fill this need. Often, legal data collection containsinformation on where laws do and do not exist with some comparison betweenthose jurisdictions. In order to consider the impact of laws on health outcomesdata at the population level, information regarding enforcement mechanisms,175. Id. at 2049.176.

Id.2020] AN ARGUMENT FOR EXPLICITPUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE IN LGBTQimplementation dates, preemption, and other granular data must exist, and in away that researchers can access it and use it in their work. In conjunction withthe CDC Public Health Law Program, we are working to collect information onstate-level laws and regulations covering sexual orientation and gender identityusing legal epidemiology methods.80 We will also collect information on state-level RFRAs. This information will be important for researchers who seek toexamine the impact of laws on health outcomes for the LGBTQ community.Currently, some excellent programs disseminate information  LGBTQlaws.' 8 None, however, provide the level of detail needed to do the kinds ofcomparisons that will allow for a thorough analysis of the impact of laws,including which provisions of the laws appear to be most useful to improvingLGBTQ health.B. Additional Considerations for ResearchAs research moves forward, it will be important to consider the limitationsto what we currently know and how we can improve knowledge on this topic.As stated above, researchers like Hatzenbuehler, Burris, and Goldberg are doinggroundbreaking work in the area of structural stigma in the field of public health.There is a substantial collection of research that shows that stigma has a negativeand pervasive impact on health. Furthermore, there is an increasing body of workthat suggests structural stigma is a part of this process. The measurement of andresearch on structural stigma remain in their early stages. It will be important todistinguish between places where the policies are more favorable to the LGBTQpopulation, because in these places, societal attitudes are already generallysupportive toward this population. Thus, in these places, policies can serve astools to further favorably impact the beliefs and behaviors of the states'populations.V. CONCLUSIONA call for action toward collective consciousness of daily discrimination andpublic health disparities faced by marginalized populations cannot be ignored.As described above, the cultural climate is influenced by the policies that areproposed and passed. These policies provide guidance for what is socially andlegally acceptable and what is not, as reflected in evolving antidiscriminationlaws. Given both the political reality embodied in discussion around RFRA laws180. For more information on the legal epidemiology method, see Theory & Methods, TEMPLEU. CTR. FOR PUB. HEALTH L.
