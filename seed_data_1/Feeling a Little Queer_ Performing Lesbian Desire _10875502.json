Flaxton, Post Pressed, pp. 113-122.  Copyright 2004 Post Pressed http://www.postpressed.com.au/index.html  Feeling a little queer? Performing lesbian desire and identity in youth texts  Kerry Mallan  Poststructuralist theories have consistently privileged the question of ‘desire’ and the associated concepts of pleasure, playfulness, and performance. Of course, the list goes on, but it is suffice to mention these in this context as the most significant and persistent. As the apex of desire-theory, ‘Queer theory’ has realised the Lyotardian (1973) notion of a ‘libidinal economy’, referring to the various drives within people that resist the workings of logic and reason. The focus on the libidinal and the shift away from the conceptual have re-directed attention to  ‘pleasures’ and ‘difference’. The seductive power of the libidinal is embraced and deployed by the processes of global consumerism and capitalist commodification with the resulting effects on sexuality and sexual politics being both exploitative and celebratory. In their most cynical extreme, these twin effects of exploitation and celebration can be seen to serve a popular and growing market -- one which has grown weary of conservative politics and economic rationalism; hence, the emergence of ‘lesbian chic’ and ‘gal pal’ images which flaunt the pleasures of female-to-female desire and ‘bad girl’ behaviour. Nevertheless, such images open up a new discursive and visual space for female subjectivity and lesbian sexuality.  In looking at desire and sexuality, feminist and psychoanalytic theories have traditionally offered a solid theoretical framework. However, in speaking about queer sexuality, and, in particular, lesbian sexuality, both feminist and psychoanalytic discourses are stretched to their limits due to their foundational arguments being based on dualistic notions of gender and sexual hierarchies. Rather than rely solely on these previous orthoxdoxies, I want to consider other ways of understanding representations of lesbian desire and identity in youth texts. By taking into account queer theory and by adopting a queer reading of the focus texts -- Show Me Love (1998)   2 and Girl Walking Backwards (Williams 1998) -- I want to explore a number of issues, and hopefully take a different spin by rendering the familiar strange, whereby categories such as ‘queer’ or ‘lesbian’ will be argued as counfounding identity, and simply as alternative forms of identity.  The Butler did it: Performativity and Queer Theory In a postmodern world characterised by fragmentation, surface play, and simulacra, queer theory seeks to further question all essentialising tendencies and binary thinking. By celebrating perversity in its many sexual and deviant particularities, queer theory mobilises ‘perversions’ as a means of resistance against patriarchal heterosexuality. Queer theorists’ appropriation of the pejorative and stimatized term ‘queer’ is a strategic move in alerting readers to the homophobic prejudices that exist in society and which are transmitted through language (naming). It also signals a form of criticism that utilises a signifier of transgressive desire and sexual instability as a metaphor to describe a category that is beyond categorisation.  Queer theory, like other theories concerned with identity politics, is not immune to internal differences. While some queer theorists such as Wittig (1992) see lesbian identity as a positive oppositional term, Butler argues that the (non)category of queer can be used to disrupt the attribution of identity: ‘I would like to have it permanently unclear what precisely that sign [lesbian] signifies’ (qtd. Evans & Gammon, 1995, p.39). It is by disrupting identity, that Butler proposes that queer theory is able to enact agency in the performativity of becoming lesbian. To see ‘lesbian’ in Judith Butler’s eyes as a (non)category is an effective way for allaying concerns that some queer theorists have about incorporating lesbians under the term ‘queer’. As Pouchard (1997, p.58) explains, such incorporation ‘risks the danger that lesbian writings and concerns will become invisible once again, erased by unquestioned assimilation under one universalising label, even in discussions of homosexuality’. In true poststructuralist fashion, Butler challenges the concept of the Self as unique, and substitutes the idea of the Self as performative, improvisational, and constituted by repetitive, stylized acts (1990). Like Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (1990) draws upon a deconstructive poststructuralist theory but she contends that other categories such as race or class might also be important in the construction of sexuality.  Sedgwick and Butler converge on a tripartite issue that is pertinent to this paper: performativity,   3 queerness, and narrative. Butler insists on the importance of performance over narrative asserting that ‘performance may preempt narrative as the scene of gender production’ (1990, p.339). This position reflects the tendency in queer theory to abjure narrative. The loss of narrative, which Lyotard sees as characterising the postmodern age, corresponds with the dissolution of the subject as being constituted through narrative. This proposition is best understood when one considers that the subject is produced through/by narratives and performatives. However, narrative depends on a time past accounting while  performativity is a present acknowledgment of the subject as the one who speaks. As Sedgwick argues, ‘“queer” can signify only when attached to the first person’ (cited in Huffer, 2001). This line of argument that Butler and Sedgwick promote centres on the queer performative subject as the one who resides within the speaking subject (the subject is self-referential) and is disconnected from others or the restrictive confines of ‘community’ (the subject is asocial). In this sense, queer performativity with its emphasis on the subject as self-referential and asocial, rejects the idea of subjectivity and intersubjectivity; concepts which are precisely what narrative as performance both dramatises and enacts (Huffer 2001).  Given that the implied readership/viewership of my focus texts is young adults, and concepts of subjectivity and intersubjectivity are often central to narratives written for this audience, the disavowal of these concepts poses problems for considering a queer performativity of identity. One answer to this problem partly resides in considering the texts from a queer ‘readerly’ perspective and less from a queer ‘writerly’ perspective. While writerly texts were a hallmark of modernist and postmodernist literature, the readerly text is more closely associated with texts of the realist tradition. Both my focus texts could be said to fall within this realist tradition (both cinematic and literary) though they embody queer performativity. In the case of Girl Walking Backwards, the text shows signs of a queer writerly approach with its spectacle of excess and erotic display where sex appears more sublime than other aspects of the narration. Furthermore, the first person accounts by the narrator, Skye, conform to Sedgwick’s point regarding the speaking subject whose explicitly self-referential mode of address consolidates otherness or queer difference within the subject/Self. Lukas Moodysson, director and writer of Show Me Love, invites a different kind of queer reading through cinematic and narrative strategies. Drawing on the familiar combination of teen angst and coming out genres, Show Me Love, like Girl Walking Backwards, foregrounds lesbian desire and its implications for queer performativity   4 and an undermining of relentless heterosexuality.  In bringing a queer reading to the selected texts, I find that feminist and psychoanalytic theories bump up against queer theories of the performative. Queer theory, though complex in its formulation, invariably takes two slightly different, yet accessible paths: one is political, the other is celebratory; the two, however, are not mutually exclusive. It is largely in the celebratory style of the artifice, performance and play of perverse sexualities that a point of convergence lies between the two focus texts. However, celebration does not diminish or erase the issues common to both texts which remain in contention: the problem of identity, the nature of desire, the relationship between gender and sexuality, and the concept of community (friends and family). These issues emerge in the following discussion.   ‘Coming out’ (and not going back in): Doing lesbian(ism) While coming out is a significant personal step for a lesbian or gay person, it is more a process than a fixed historical action. Coming out, as a celebratory narrative, is a relatively new trope as earlier stories of  ‘coming out’ presented homosexuality and lesbianism as ‘a social, personal or psychological tragedy’ and were marketed as ‘problem’ films or novels (Bronski 2000). In many of these earlier examples, it was more a case that the gay/lesbian character was ‘outed’ rather than ‘came out’. In more recent films (e.g. Beautiful Thing), the found out/came out mix still exists, but the results are often less disastrous.   The ‘coming out’ narrative, especially in film, has become a more accepted genre in mainstream consumerism, thus ensuring its commercial viability. However, one could suggest that film producers, and possibly YA publishers, are more likely to produce and market a coming out story which is not too contentious and is less political than those that  fringe or independent companies might produce for a more select market. This view is supported in the international marketing of the Swedish film Show Me Love. Originally titled Fucking Åmål, which neatly captured the young protagonists’ view of the boring town in which the story takes place, the renaming of the film to the more bland but universally acceptable title Show Me Love was considered important for distribution rights. As reported in The Village Voice  (Winter 2001), the distributors were concerned that some people might think Fucking Åmål was Turkish gay porn. Attempts like this to secure mainstream acceptance with queer cultural products work to ensure that at a superficial   5 level there will be social acceptance of filmic representations of lesbian/gay sexualities. However, at a deeper philosophical level, the political may be considerably weakened and difference may be liberally interpreted as sameness-- they’re just like us!   Another means for pathologising the queer in texts has been to show lesbians as unattractive and abnormal.  However, there has been a shift from earlier versions of the butch-in-leather to a softer more conventionally attractive lesbian-- they look just like us! In Show Me Love, bad girl Elin, the fourteen year old who initially flaunts her heterosexuality is described by one reviewer as a ‘mercurial mini-Bardot’ (Winter 2001); Elin, too, states the obvious when she surveys her image in a lift mirror and declares: ‘I’m so bloody beautiful’. In a similar vein, the text of Girl Walking Backwards explicitly states that Skye, the first person narrator, is ‘pretty’ and sexually desirable to men; a fact of which Skye is keenly aware.  While this makeover of the lesbian body could be seen as a further step in cleaning up any undesirable lesbian residue and ensuring that the lesbian body is normalised, made consumable, and by implication, less threatening, this is not so straight forward a process in the focus texts where the attractiveness of the characters as white, slim, femmes and their mix of middle and working class backgrounds further complicate the identity-in-difference agenda of queer theory; a point which recalls Sedgwick’s comment that race and class are other informing discourses to sexuality. (Another character Mol [Girl Walking Backwards] is constructed as the archetypal ‘butch’ lesbian with her oversized body, Gothic appearance, and in-your-face style of speaking and behaving. Yet, she is straight, and surprisingly maternal. Thus, the disjunction between her image and her behaviour disrupts familiar stereotypes and categorising of the lesbian or heterosexual body.)   The normalising process to subsume ‘queer’ under a more benign, but still dominant, heterosexual framework is an attempt to fix lesbian (and gay) characters in stable, recognisable ‘sexual identities’. This disappearing trick of the perverse queer subject is executed in a number of ways. For instance, comedy becomes a useful device for de-politicising queer performativity and for raising its marketability. There have been numerous examples where comedy is employed in film and literature to show difference as a scream,  particularly in male-to-female crossdressing (for example, Mrs Doubtfire 1993; Tootsie 1982). Comedy can also be used to   6 achieve a more incisive view of society and homophobic discourses. When comedy takes on a sharper edge in the form of parody, it can serve to capture both the psychological and personal pressures that a lesbian or gay character experiences in coming out. A narrative which does not simply focus on the coming out aspect of the young protagonist but attempts to embed it within a broader project may offer a stronger storyline and more complex characterisation, as well as construct a more nuanced representation of the lesbian subject.   Bronski (2001) makes a significant point when he remarks that ‘coming out is nearly always the end point, never the beginning of the plot’ . If coming out is portrayed as the ‘keystone moment’ then the narrative trajectory is considerably focused on getting to this one event and the consequences of coming out are rarely explored. The happy-ever-after ending connotes a lifetime of happiness and fulfilment for the young protagonists. Given this narrative structure, the lesbian coming out story begins to resemble the typical teen heterosexual romance tale, but with a gender twist: girl meets girl, girl takes up with girl. The inevitable ups and downs between these two points serve as mere moments of ‘will they or won’t they?’ for the reader/viewer who is in there batting for the young romantics, perhaps adopting a disguise of libertarianism to cover a voyeuristic desire.  In the Southern Californian based novel, Girl Walking Backwards, sixteen year old Skye comes out early in the story (chapter one), and so is an exception to Bronski’s observation. In her quest to fulfil a fantasy of saving a half-dead runaway girl, Skye enlists as a volunteer for Planned Parenthood: a program run by the sleazy and middle-aged Don (Don Juan?) who has already singled out Skye as a potential sexual conquest. Skye’s first assignment is to address a class of sophomore students as part of a peer education program. At the end of her talk, which includes the use of a banana and a condom, one of the leering jocks in the class asks Skye: ‘What kind of contraceptive do you use?’ To which Skye replies: ‘Nothing....I’m not heterosexual’ (p.13). Needless to say, Don’s smile disappears along with his sexual agenda.   In Show Me Love, Agnes and Elin became lovers as part of a survival strategy for overcoming death-by-boredom in claustrophobic Amal, where television quiz shows are the highlight of community life. Their ‘coming out’ is included as part of a broader teen rebellion against continuing ennui and oppressive strictures that limit their lives. It is also a public act, and   7 narratively forms the penultimate scene where Elin whisks Agnes into a toilet in the school canteen and apologises for her previous rejection and bad treatment of her. Once this part of their past is resolved they declare their love for each other. The declaration is not of operatic proportions, but a simple statement. Meanwhile a frenetic crowd of students, Elin’s sister, Jessica, and a teacher have gathered outside the toilet shouting for Elin to come out with the boy she has obviously sequestered away in the loo. When the door opens and Elin and Agnes walk out arm in arm, the coming out moment is a triumphant and openly deviant step for the girls.  By using the school toilet as the space from which the girls emerge, Moodysson has managed to convey a series of double moves in the coming out process: personal/public; closed/open; comedic/political. The camera too is in on the act as it captures the visual disruption of the heterosexual imperative which pervades both the school and the community. (The looks on the faces of the crowd say it all.)  Both Girl Walking Backwards and Show Me Love challenge the traditional coming out story as the writers have attempted to embed ‘lesbianism’ within a broader social and cultural context. While having a lover forms a key part of the young protagonists’ longings, the effects of lesbian desire are also felt in the community of parents and friends. Hence, the narratives treat seriously the desire for belonging, and the desire for difference. However, seriousness does not parade itself like a melodramatic diva as it is often accompanied by humour to avoid any grandstanding. For example, when Elin asks Agnes if she is a lesbian, Agnes shyly nods her head. Elin quickly responds with all the impetuosity of teen spirit: ‘I’m going to be one too, I think’. If you missed Elin’s initial question to Agnes, you could be forgiven for thinking that Elin was speaking of a future career choice, perhaps as a supermodel. Consequently, her unformulated response appears to elide the complexity of desire: desire to be and desire for; yet, ironically, the elision and the uncertainty that are part of Elin’s response foreground desire as a production of a fantasy in the Lacanian sense of ‘lack’ (her desire for), and as a production of a reality (the desire to be).  The lesbian performative subject entails more than the ‘coming out’ act but is a continuous process of negotiation and reinscription of the body’s material and discursive constructions. In both Show Me Love and Girl Walking Backwards, the subjects’ lesbian identities and desires are not restricted to their coming out process, which is one part of their lives. Consequently, identity-  8 in-difference is both foregrounded and socially embedded, particularly through intersubjective relations, disrupting queer theory’s disavowing of subjectivity and community.   Mad, Bad and Awful: and that’s just the mother The family environment forms a significant part of the community in which the young protagonists live. The mothers of Skye, Elin and Agnes form an interesting chorus of voices ranging from hysterics to sighs, they also occupy different spaces in the texts: Skye’s mother is always a vociferous presence, Elin’s mother is either away working or watching game shows, and Agnes’s mother moves around the home casting looks of judgment and disappointment. Fathers, on the other hand, are either absent (Elin), caring but inept (Agnes), or unreliable and self-absorbed (Skye). By briefly focussing attention on the girls’ family environments, particularly Skye’s, the illusion of coherence that is maintained through compulsory heterosexuality is shattered and a queer reading of the performative functions of both the queer and the straight body in the texts is possible.  In coming to an understanding of queer performativity I want to make a few perverse turns in my reading of the texts by playing with the notion of ‘queer’ and the attribution of ‘queerness’. By moving along the axis of queerness to explore a number of queer performances, which include sexual, parodic, and perverse, I want to consider how the discourse of queer (re)inscribes itself in these texts in multiple ways. A starting point is Skye’s mother.  The mother-daughter relationship features importantly in both texts, but it is Skye’s mother, Anna, in Girl Walking Backwards, who appears as the most defined and defining character. Anna is described in the register of a love wanted column by her daughter-as-narrator:  mom. blond. thirty-nine. divorced. Depressed. Into New Age and ceramics. Seeking     God, preferably wealthy and not into independent filmmaking  (p.15). (Her former husband was an independent filmmaker.) This description provides the reader with initial information about Anna’s own heterosexuality which plays a crucial part in her daughter’s recognition that society does not embrace same sex relationships, especially between women. Anna tries to enforce compulsory heterosexuality upon her daughter and takes desperate actions to convince Skye of the folly of her ways: counselling sessions, New Age exorcism and other bizarre rituals. Anna’s frequent attempts to convince Skye of the naturalness of heterosexuality   9 and the perversity of homosexuality reiterate familiar binary oppositions and the notion of lesbianism as a form of pathology:  [Anne]‘...You know it’s true, don’t you? I mean we’re created as male and female       bodies for a reason.’ [Skye] ‘Maybe I’m a man in a woman’s body.’ [Anne]‘But you’re so beautiful, you’re so feminine if you’d get out of those jeans for   one second. Tell me, honey, honestly. Did anyone abuse you? Did your father do anything to you? We did so many drugs back then. It’s all a blur.’  (p.22).   Anna is also vehement and excessive in the accusations and abuse she directs towards her daughter. However, it is through the construction of the mother-as-hysteric who is excessive, uncontrollable, and vociferous, that enables a reading of ‘queer’ which opens out its meaning and points to a play of incongruous pairing operating along the axis of queerness. Not only does Anna’s didacticism fail to achieve its desired outcome, but her relentless heterosexual project of conversion eventually results in a parodying of the tropes of naturalness and respectability. This parodying of natural, respectable motherhood and marriage is seen in the following ways: her marriage with its drug taking, child neglect, jealousies and aberrant behaviours inverts the utopian ideal of the happy, perfect heterosexual married couple; her disregard for and abuse towards Skye mocks the essentialist rhetoric of ‘motherly love’ and appearances of maternal decorum. Furthermore, her repeated attempts at self-fashioning through New Age courses shatter any notion of a stable, coherent identity. Consequently, Anna is a perverse, abject subject and it is in this ironic point that the play of ‘queer’ as an accumulation of meaning offers not only a double entrendre but points to the parodic performance of queer in the text and invites continual deconstruction of its meaning in order to destabilise the binary opposition of lesbian/straight.  Skye’s first love interest, Jessica, is similarly represented as perverse, another ‘queer’ subject. Her repeated acts of self-mutilation also make her an abject subject like Anna -- both women are fractured, wounded, oscillating between different identity positions. The parody of the maternal subject, however, reaches its queer climax when a fixed sex/gender role is attributed to a dead bird which Jessica and Skye find lying on the ground by a tree. As Jessica cradles the dead creature in her hands, Skye can only focus on Jessica’s breasts which show through her shirt. This viewing of the breasts as objects of erotic lusting perverts the maternal performance offered by Jessica towards the bird. The perversity continues when Jessica decides to name the bird Heda   10 and dresses it in Barbie clothes before entombing it in a plastic bag and storing it in the freezer. When Skye’s mother eventually finds Heda it has been transformed and no longer bears any relation to its real self, it has become its own simulacrum: ‘Poking out from Mom’s death grasp was a feathery head. Heda. She opened her palm to reveal her little shrinking body still in the pink bathing suit and sandals’ (p.196). The parodying of gender performed by the attribution of ‘femaleness’ to a dead bird re-inscribes itself within the narrative through the agency of queer. This attempt at a queer reading, which in itself can be read as perverse, exposes gender/sexual identity as a grotesque caricature.  Conclusion It is perhaps through a queer writerly approach that Williams is able to offer perverse images of women in Girl Walking Backwards, an approach which is not evident in Moodysson’s Show Me Love. Girl Walking Backwards attempts to move beyond mere provoking of lust and excitation in the male reader through imaging the unrespectable and unrepresentable in terms of its aberrant representations of mothers and explicit accounts of female-to-female desire: Anna screams, swears and is in many ways the ‘bad mother’; Jessica mutilates her body with razors, the flowing rivulets of blood offering contradictory states of repulsion and attraction, pain and pleasure; young women vomit from too much drink; toilets become the place for sex and intimate encounters; and the private pleasures of auto-eroticism are openly described. Therefore, the text offers a shocking and a politically and aesthetically transgressive view, yet it manages to reclaim perversity from the pathological. The reader is left with images of the monstrous mother, pornographic love making, and exciting, cruel, caring, obscene, neurotic, and sexually self-aware female characters. By contrast, Show Me Love offers a male vision of the lesbian erotic which seeks to transgress and displace the norm/al and the conventional, but it, nevertheless, incorporates the aberrant within dominant forms of representation. Both texts close with the celebration of the dawning of joyful lesbian lust. While the young lovers in Girl Walking Backwards share a laugh after love making, Agnes and Elin sip hot chocolate and slip into easy conversation. The naturalness of these post-coital states reflects the coming of age of the adolescent lesbian text. It would seem that yesterday’s decorum has been replaced by a postmodern desire, which attempts with varying degrees of success, to challenge dominant codes of sexuality, morality, and eroticism.    11 References Bronski, M.
