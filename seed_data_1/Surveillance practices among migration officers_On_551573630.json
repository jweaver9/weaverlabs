Dec. 2022 1 Surveillance practices among migration officers: Online media and LGBTQ+ refugees  By: Marie Lunau1 and Rikke Andreassen   Abstract: Examining Denmark as a case study, and focusing on LGBTQ+ asylum seekers in particular, this article investigates migration authorities’ use of online surveillance to assess claims for asylum. Drawing on interviews with migration officers and asylum seekers, the article describes how asylum seekers’ social media and phone content comes to determine whether they are seen as having a ‘genuine’ or a ‘fraudulent’ LGBTQ+ identity. The article further shows how surveillance implicates asylum seekers’ movement and (im)mobility, thereby ‘fixing’ their identities across time, preventing their ephemeral online engagement and, ultimately, affecting the outcome of their asylum claims. It also argues that the utilisation of surveillance technologies (to, e.g., review porn consumption and dating applications) favours gay (cis) men, while depriving lesbian, bisexual and transgender asylum seekers of opportunities to prove their identity. This article is part of the special issue Cultures of (Im)Mobile Entanglements, edited by Earvin Cabalquinto and Koen Leurs.  Key words: LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, social media, migration officers, surveillance, migration, (im)mobilities, movement   Introduction European countries are increasingly surveilling the phone content and online activity of asylum seekers in the process of evaluating asylum claims. In the Danish context, such surveillance is particularly employed by migration officers2 to assess the asylum claims of LGBTQ+3 applicants (Andreassen, 2021). For a number of years, Norway and the UK have been routinely searching asylum seekers’ phones; more recently, countries such as Germany and Denmark have expanded their laws to permit similar examinations, also extending to applicants’ social media accounts (Meaker, 2018). Taking Denmark as a case, this article is concerned with the ways in which migration officers surveil social media to determine LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ credibility and access to asylum. The increased use of social media surveillance in LGBTQ+ asylum cases points to a significant change in the process of determining who can be confirmed or disconfirmed as a ‘trustworthy’ queer4. In particular, the article draws on the conceptual framework of (im)mobilities (Sheller & Urry, 2006) to consider how surveillance technologies within the asylum system work to enhance the mobility of some applicants and heighten the immobility of others, in relation to both social media engagement and physical border crossing.  European countries receive a number of asylum claims from LGBTQ+ people who are fleeing countries in which they risk persecution based on their sexuality and/or gender identity (Jansen & Spijkerboer, 2011). The 1951 Refugee Convention stipulates that asylum may be granted to persons with a ‘well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion’ (UNHCR, 2010:4). Adopted from the Convention, the Danish Aliens Act provides the legal basis for refugees with an asylum motive relating to sexual orientation and gender identity to be eligible for asylum under the category of belonging to a ‘particular social group’ (Danish Immigration Service, 2019). To be eligible for protection, LGBTQ+ asylum seekers must prove that they are members of ‘a particular social group’ (i.e. that they are ‘genuine’ LGBTQ+ persons) and that they have a ‘well-founded fear of persecution’ (i.e. that they are persecuted because of their status as LGBTQ+ persons). In their evaluation of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ claims, migration officers assess the consistency of applicants’ stories, the  2 stories’ alignment with the relevant ‘country profiles’ (i.e. the record of human rights violations relating to sexuality and gender identity in applicants’ countries of origin) and the credibility of applicants’ belonging to the persecuted group (Danish Refugee Council, 2020).  International studies in the emerging field of queer migration have highlighted that numerous LGBTQ+ asylum claims are rejected due to doubts over the applicant’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity (Berg & Millbank, 2009; Dustin & Held, 2018; Ferreira, 2018; Jansen & Spijkerboer, 2011). These findings reveal the difficulties that LGBTQ+ asylum seekers experience in documenting, proving and translating their identities into recognisable narratives for European receiving countries. In light of these challenges, migration officers are increasingly turning to applicants’ social media accounts and phone content to find additional evidence for their assessment. The phenomenon of utilising applicants’ phones as archives of evidence to establish trustworthiness can be seen as related to the growing reliance on biometrical data tracing in asylum management across Europe. This, in turn, connects to broader trends in identity management, exemplified by heightened concerns around terrorism, migration and asylum seeking (Lyon, 2013).  In this article, we analyse the implications of the emerging modes and practices of technological identification and surveillance that are utilised to assess LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. We analyse how technological surveillance of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers implicates their movement, (im)mobility, ‘fixation’ and, ultimately, the outcome of their claims for asylum. To begin, we analyse how LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ phones have become important archives of evidence to confirm or disconfirm the ‘truthfulness’ of applicants’ claimed identities, and how this facilitates both movement and immobility for different categories of applicants. In addition, we analyse how consistent, straightforward and binary online expressions of sexuality seem necessary for LGBTQ+ applicants to be recognised as ‘genuine’ homosexual asylum seekers. We further show how migration officers’ online surveillance tools favour gay (cis) men, while limiting opportunities for lesbian and transgender asylum seekers to prove their identities. We also explore what it might mean when migration officers express more complex and ambivalent understandings of sexuality than those espoused by the system.   Empirical material and methodological approaches  Drawing on 8 qualitative, semi-structured interviews with migration officers at the Danish Immigration Service5 and 10 interviews with LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, this article illustrates how social media and phone content is systematically surveilled and examined in the evaluation of asylum cases. Before beginning the research process, we formally contacted the Danish Immigration Service with detailed information about the study to request access to conduct interviews in the department. The permission was given and the interviewees were selected for (voluntarily) participation through the department; 8 interviews corresponds to almost half of the employees evaluating asylum cases at the time. These interviews were conducted in Danish, ranged in length from 1 to 1.5 hours, and took place at the immigration offices. Differently, interviews with LGBTQ+ asylum seekers were conducted in English at an asylum centre in Denmark, and had an average length of approximately 2 hours. The asylum seekers were recruited with help from the Danish organisation LGBT Asylum. The interviewed asylum seekers come from countries in North, East and Central Africa as well as countries in the Middle East, South America and Southeast Asia. Five of them self-identified as cis gay men, four as cis lesbian women and one as a transwoman. All interviewees were informed of their rights when participating in the study, and provided informed consent. In this article, all interviewees are referred to by pseudonyms, in order to protect their anonymity.  The present focus on migration officer practices is of critical importance for improving our understanding of the LGBTQ+ asylum seeking process. Ultimately, it is the migration officer who decides whether asylum is granted or denied. As Haas (2019:107) describes: ‘At the heart of the  3 asylum process […] is the stark fact that it is an institutional actor and not the asylum seeker himself or herself who decides if his or her story of suffering is truthful or sufficient enough to be considered deserving of asylum status.’ The legal power of the migration officer is very clear: it is only the migration officer – representing the asylum system – who possesses the authority to judge the power of the evidence provided by the applicant (including their social media and phone content) and, ultimately, determine their story as ‘true’ or ‘false’.  Methodologically, we understand the interviews with both migration officers and asylum seekers as offering a window into current institutional practices within the Danish asylum system. While the stories presented are situated and partially created narratives that cannot be considered transparent and objective renditions of truth (Haraway, 1988); they are indicative of the ways in which interviewees’ experiences and rationales are entangled in social, cultural and legal structures. While we do not claim generalisability from the findings, the study provides insights into important patterns of contemporary asylum processes.   State of the art and theoretical framing  This article addresses and situates itself within the theoretical frameworks of critical mobility research, queer migration theory, media studies and critical data studies. Critical mobility research is concerned with (im)mobility and stillness, as well as the speed and flow of migrations, and examines how these temporalities are produced, practiced and represented in relation to gender, race and class (Ahmed et al., 2020; Cresswell, 2006). Urry (2007) argues that differing intensities of (im)mobility are perpetuated through uneven access to technological systems. In this sense, the differing scales of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ (im)mobility are vital to the ways in which technological surveillance reconfigures their movement. Although sexual orientation and gender identity are accepted as legal grounds for asylum, contested ideas and understandings of sexuality and gender create specific challenges for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers (Berg & Millbank, 2009; Jansen & Spijkerboer, 2011). Luibhéid and Cantú (2005) underline the lack of international knowledge about sexuality’s impact on migration processes. However, an emerging body of research on queer migration is investigating how normative imaginaries of queerness underpin and sustain notions of truth in evaluations of asylum claims (Cantú, 2009; Luibhéid, 2008). This literature suggests that immigration assessment is based on Eurocentric expectations of narrow, binary notions of ‘truthful’ sexualities and gender identities that rely on essentialist understandings of identity categories (Shakhsari, 2014). This, in turn, forces LGBTQ+ asylum seekers to align with stereotypical understandings of LGBTQ+ identities and lifestyles in order to be acknowledged by migration officers (Akin, 2016; Mühleisen et al., 2012).  This article draws upon two strands of online media scholarship: (i) user engagement and experiences with online media and (ii) the critical examination of online platforms. The first strand, which focuses on users, examines how online media (as structures or spaces) contribute to forming subjectivities and communities. Within this literature, scholars have analysed how online media limit subjectivities (in terms of gender expression and sexuality affiliation), while allowing for expressions of and experimentation with subjectivities related to gender and sexuality. Illustratively, O’Riordan and Phillips’ Queer Online (2007) illustrates how LGBTQ+ people engage with online media to meet desires, express identities and connect and form communities; Kitzie (2018) describes how young people use social media to experiment with gender expression and sexuality; Raun (2016) demonstrates how transgender individuals use YouTube to share their transition stories and shape subjectivity; and Andreassen (2018) shows how queer mothers create kinship and community via online sharing. Common to this scholarship are descriptions of the underlying dualities that characterise LGBTQ+ people’s engagement with online media: first, the duality between how online media platforms aim at creating coherent user identities (in terms of gender and sexuality), while  4 users express transition, ambivalence and fluidity; and second, the duality between users’ online expressions and their (often) different physical/offline subjectivity and gender/sexuality expressions. The second strand is often termed ‘critical data studies’. This literature focuses on the ways in which power and ideologies are integrated into data processes and performances. While this field is vast, here, we are particularly interested in research that analyses platforms and the consequences of creating a culture in which individuals are encouraged to express themselves online. As examples of this literature, Payne (2015) points to how the language of ‘sharing’ has become dominant in describing online user activity, replacing the language of ‘communicating’ (2015:6); and Van Dijck (2013:45) highlights the power and hierarchies imbedded in ‘the imperative of sharing’. In her analysis of Facebook (Meta), Van Dijck describes how the sharing of personal information has become the norm for Facebook engagement. While the logic of this platform encourages user engagement via ‘sharing’, it is precisely that same engagement (sharing) that contributes to data activity, which the platform owners capitalise.  Studies at the intersection of migration and social media have predominately focused on asylum seekers’ social media use during their migration and application processes (Dekker et al., 2016; Merisalo & Jauhiainen, 2021). In light of asylum seekers’ increasing use of social media, scholars have begun discussing new opportunities for migration officers to verify or refute claims based on applicants’ online activity (Bolhuis & van Wijk, 2021; Andreassen, 2021). For instance, Bolhuis and van Wijk (2021) analyse how European migration officers refer to social media content in their assessment of asylum claims. They critically discuss the legal, normative and ethical consequences of this practice, arguing that online surveillance infringes on applicants’ right to privacy. In a similar vein, Gabrielsen Jumbert et al. (2018) note that justification of the surveillance of smartphones and social media profiles is premised on the idea that digital traces might unveil the ‘truth’ about individuals. While there is an emerging literature on the relationship between refugees, smartphone content and social media content in asylum processes, studies focusing on the social media surveillance of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers remains scarce. In the Nordic context, such scholarship is limited to a single Danish study on how social media platforms are reviewed to determine asylum seekers as ‘genuine’ or ‘fraudulent’ (Andreassen, 2021). This article aims at contributing to this discourse.  The phone as an (immobile) archive of identifying information Danish migration officers have come to consider LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ phones as important archival sites of ‘truth’. In our interviews with Danish migration officers, they described how, over the prior years, phone content had increasingly entered into the evaluation process, especially with respect to LGBTQ+ asylum cases.6 A migration officer expressed that there was a tacit acknowledgement in the department that, when cases of homosexuality arose, officers should obtain information from the applicant’s phone (Anne). According to the migration officers, this information could include content on social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Grindr, Tinder), venues and locations the applicant had ‘checked in’ to, photos and pages he/she/they had liked or commented on, correspondence with partners and lovers, content on dating apps and online search histories. Prior to retrieving content from applicants’ phones and online (including social media) history, the Danish Immigration Service is required to obtain applicants’ informed consent. While applicants are not obligated to submit their phones, they are encouraged to comply with the conditions that all asylum seekers are obliged to provide information about their own cases.  The practice of extracting information from phones was described as a way of collecting not only information about an asylum seeker’s case, but also ‘evidence, either because their story is true or because their phones show something other than what they are telling us’ (Louise). In other words, the review of applicants’ online activity aimed at uncovering information that conflicted with  5 their stories. Some of the migration officers (e.g. Louise, Anne) commented that it was difficult to determine whether an asylum seeker was speaking truthfully. Thus, it was implied that the surveillance of online media could provide proof of a story that was otherwise complicated to prove. In her interviews with US migration officers, Haas (2019) noted a perceived division between asylum claimants’ personal narratives – considered subjective evidence – and external documentation, such as legal documents, medical files and country reports – considered objective evidence. Because refugees are met as ‘figure[s] of suspicion’ (2019:106), their personal narratives of persecution and potential danger must be confirmed (or disconfirmed) by external evidence. Due to the difficulties involved in determining ‘fraudulent’ from ‘genuine’ LGBTQ+ identities, Danish migration officers may view online media content as objective evidence to confirm (or disconfirm) an applicant’s claims. The migration officers’ descriptions of their use of technologies to extract online evidence suggest that they viewed the practice as accurate at revealing the ‘truth’ of an applicant’s identity. Haas (2019) described how migration officials seem to base their assessment of asylum claims on an ‘archaeological method’, with the asylum seeker’s identity (as either ‘genuine’ or ‘fraudulent’) at the forefront of the investigation. However, the idea that the phone is an archive of legitimate evidence breaks the complexity of human identity into discrete, simple indicators of un/trustworthiness that can be assessed using technology. In contrast to an individual’s ambivalent physical and online identity, their technologically traced identity prevails as a significant source of information – and thereby truth. In an interview with gay asylum seeker Igor, he expressed concern of not having the ‘right’ kind of technological evidence to prove his persecution. Igor sarcastically noted that he should travel back to his home country to be assaulted and take a selfie of the injuries, in order to prove the danger of persecution based on his sexual orientation. He further remarked that the asylum system wants non-ambiguous, easily identifiable indications of sexual identities and persecution. Subjected to this practice, refugees become immobile in their gender and sexual subjectivities. The interpretation of media content as ‘evidence of truth’ prevents mobility between different or ambivalent gendered/sexual identities. While Urry (2007) describes how (im)mobility is influenced by uneven access to technology, this case points to how uneven interpretations of media provide LGBTQ+ people with European citizenship mobility to experiment with different expressions of sexuality online, while the equivalent mobility is withheld for LGBTQ+ refugees. Andreassen (2021) shows how social media profiles can serve as digital archives for migration officers, who search them for historical information in order to determine an asylum verdict. In this sense, surveillance ‘freezes’ asylum seekers’ sexual identities in time, and hinders online mobility between (the expressions of) different gendered and sexual identities. While online media engagement is often perceived as ephemeral – and, as such, characterised by fluidity and mobility – migration officers’ use of past media engagement as evidence for present identities prevents LGBTQ+ refugees from ephemeral engagement.  Furthermore, the reliance on LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ phones as information archives implies that intimate, sexual and affective online behaviour is evidential to sexuality and gender identity. Migration officers focus their phone searches on erotic and intimate content, as well as correspondence that confirms or disconfirms a romantic relationship or sexual encounter. In an interview, a lesbian asylum seeker talked about her experience of having her phone assessed. She explained that a migration officer asked her how frequently she communicated with her partner, to which she replied: ‘Every day’. To test her story, the migration officer searched her phone for communication with her girlfriend. The interviewee expressed that it felt ‘weird’ that the officer had to see her private, intimate conservations with her partner:   6 ‘There is nothing bad [with our conversations], there is nothing happening, but it’s like your thing. It’s your [private] thing! You say it as you want it to your person [partner] and you don’t expect someone to see it. I don’t know how to say it... But there was nothing bad, it was just us.’ (Samira)  Samira emphasised that there was nothing ‘bad’ on her phone that would implicate her story. Nonetheless, her comment illustrates how the surveillance and monitoring of her everyday communication with her partner created a sense of fear about whether the content would be considered ‘right’ or ‘good enough’. She also underlined the discomfort involved in the surveillance of her intimate and private messages, which were never intended to be read by others; those messages were ‘their thing’, as she phrased it. In this sense, LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ phones are treated as technologically ‘intimate archives’ (White, 2010) that provide instant ‘truth’ about the applicants, within the state’s frame of recognition.   Consistency is required to be a ‘genuine’ homosexual The interviewed migration officers repeatedly underscored the need for asylum seekers to provide stringent, consistent narratives, and they used online media to confirm or disconfirm this consistency. As LGBTQ+ cases are judged in relation to trustworthiness, consistency is needed to secure credibility. A migration officer described:   ‘The general attitude from the Immigration Service is that they want it [the told narrative and phone content] to be consistent. So the content of one’s phone – erotic images or videos or searches at porn sites – should be consistent with the story they [asylum seekers] tell or the sexual orientation they claim.’ (Louise)  In other words, if an applicant claims asylum due to homosexuality, then the claimed homosexuality must be ‘tested’ via a phone search. A migration officer explained: ‘There can be information [on the phone] which supports their narrative, and there can be information which does not support it. It can go both ways’ (Mette). She elaborated:   ‘if they have Grindr [a male hook-up app] […] and have an active profile [on Grindr], where we can see that they have been very, very active, that is something which can support that they actually have the sexuality they claim to have […] It can also be opposite, i.e. there is contradictory information, which will lead one to ask questions: “Well, we can see that you only have Tinder, and that that you are only searching for women.”’ (Mette)  The demand for consistency requires claimants’ narratives to support a rigid binary understanding of homosexuality versus heterosexuality (see also Dustin & Held, 2018:80). As a consequence, it can be challenging for refugees with bisexual or pansexual identities, or a fluid practice of sexuality, to be recognised as ‘genuine’ LGBTQ+ asylum seekers by migration officers. This is because any queer sexuality or ambivalence (or variation) in sexual practices (or partners) might lead migration officers to distrust their stories. As Haas (2019:207) argues, a ‘lens of suspicion […] informs the everyday micropolitics of asylum adjudication’; such suspicion can explain why ambivalence (or queerness) causes mistrust.  The interviewed migration officers explicitly expressed that asylum claims involving bisexuality are more complicated to evaluate than cases involving homosexuality. One officer said: ‘Bisexuality. That is one of the things that is hard to determine […] It is very, very difficult to claim  7 asylum based on that [bisexuality] and [very, very difficult] to obtain asylum [based on bisexuality]’ (Louise). Another officer explained:   ‘It is more complicated with the bisexuals […] In general, for us [adjudicators] we have difficulties with it […] People [adjudicators] have a hard time [with it] and I think that we in our adjudications have more difficulties determining [bisexuals] […] [Some claimants] have had partners of both genders […] We ask them “Have you ever been attracted to [a woman / a man]?” and if it is a man who says that he likes men, then when he says “I have never been attracted to a woman”, then it is obvious that this is a much easier answer [for our evaluation] than if they say they have been attracted to both men and women. It is much easier with homosexuality than with bisexuality.’ (Anne)   In these examples, both officers defined stories that fit into the binary narrative (i.e. attraction to only one gender), as this was deemed much easier to judge in the evaluation of asylum claims. Lesbian asylum seeker, Fatima, expressed a similar experience of not being recognised as lesbian within the asylum system because the trajectory of her sexual history does not align with the understanding of a fixed and stable sexual orientation. Originally, Fatima was forced to flee to Denmark at the age of 21 because of war in her home country. Now, years later, the Immigration Service has rejected her claim for asylum because she did not mention her sexual identity in her original claim. As Fatima described:   ‘They said: ‘Why do you bring your LGBT status now when you didn’t bring it up before?’ I just discovered myself [as a lesbian]. … 11 years ago, when I came to Denmark … I did not know that I was LGBT.’ (Fatima)   While the realities of lived experiences are often more messy, mobile and complex than what is otherwise accommodated by a rigid, binary framework, the asylum system nonetheless rewards stringent, immobile stories. Many LGBTQ+ refugees have not lived according to a binary homosexual or heterosexual narrative. First, a number of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers have had limited opportunities to follow their sexual desires and attractions, due to actual danger or threats against them in their home countries. Second, many LGBTQ+ asylum seekers – especially, but not solely, women – have been forced into marriages by their families, after their families have become aware of their homosexual desires. Thus, for a number of reasons – many related to homophobia and hate crimes against LGBTQ+ persons – many LGBTQ+ asylum claimants have not been able to live out a ‘pure’ homosexual narrative, as expected by the asylum system (see also Lewis, 2019, for a description of how bisexuality and fluid sexuality complicates asylum cases in the UK). Despite the ‘messiness’ of lived experiences, migration officials’ rigid frame of interpretation discredits asylum seekers’ mobility between partners and relationships, while rewarding asylum seekers who ‘hold still’ in pre-determined categories of sexuality.  None of the interviewed officers mentioned potential discrepancies between applicants’ online and offline lives. While media research (e.g. Kitzie, 2018) points to significant differences and ambivalence between online expression and offline conduct among LGBTQ+ people, the migration officers seemed to insist that they match in a linear way. Gabrielsen Jumbert et al. (2018) argue that asylum seekers’ online life plays a crucial role in the definition of their identities. They point to a discoursal change in the surveillance of migration: while practices were previously centred on identity testing and movement tracking through biometrics, based on an assumption that ‘the body does not lie’, the discourse now seems premised on a new belief, that ‘the digital device does not lie’, with the smartphone now understood as a record of the ‘digital self’ (Gabrielsen Jumbert et al., 2018). In our  8 interviews, the migration officers revealed a tendency to rely on online platforms as accurate and truthful, even while acknowledging the complexities and (perhaps) limitations of this approach.  During the interviews, a discrepancy arose between individual migration officers’ understanding of sexual fantasies as fluid versus the institution’s demand for complete alignment between applicants’ sexual identities and sexual fantasies. An officer explained:   ‘It is much more complex than one just watches the same [porn] as one is attracted to [in real life]. I mean, people watch rape porn, but they do not have a wish to be raped. In that way, it is extremely complex and much more nuanced that just saying that gay men watch gay porn.’ (Louise)  Simultaneously, the same officer said: ‘the content of one’s phone […] has to be consistent with […] the sexuality one claims’ (Louise). It is difficult to determine precisely what is at play in this discrepancy between the migration officer’s understanding of sexuality and that of the institution; however, a similar disagreement emerged in several interviews. One interpretation may be that, while the individual officers acknowledged that sexual fantasies are complex, they referred to the institutional framing in order to justify their rejections of asylum based on sexually inconsistent stories. Alternatively, it may be that the migration officers understood sexuality as nuanced on a theoretical level – and felt the need to express this understanding to the interviewer – while simultaneously understanding sexuality as linear on the practical level of asylum judgement claims. Haas (2019) describes how US migration officers avoid responsibility by referring to other migration authorities when denying asylum. However, the contradictions that emerged in our Danish interviews might not refer to responsibility, but (and this is a third option) represent an indirect criticism of the rigid legislation guiding asylum cases.   An LGBT asylum seeker is a (cis) gay man The interviewed migration officers tended to conceptualise LGBTQ+ asylum seekers as (cis) gay men. Verbally, they used the term ‘LGBT’, but when talking about individual LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, they defaulted to the pronoun ‘he’. Similarly, the majority of their actual or imaginary examples of asylum cases were of (cis) gay men. Illustratively, a migration officer who was asked to provide examples of the questions she and her colleagues typically asked asylum seekers, answered: ‘How did you discover that you were attracted to boys?’ (Camilla), as if homosexuality could be reduced to male-on-male attraction. While some of the officers did mention female asylum seekers – mainly in passing, and often not in relation to LGBTQ+ refugees – and one officer provided an example of a transgender refugee, none of the interviewees referred to lesbian women or transgender people when describing their processes of evaluating LGBTQ+ refugees, and none used the pronoun ‘she’ as a default when discussing LGBTQ+ refugees. Despite the potential inclusion of a range of identities under the LGBTQ+ umbrella, only (cis) gay men figured in the interview material, and (cis) gay men dominated the migration authorities’ accounts and imaginaries of asylum seekers.7  This emphasis on (cis) gay men within the migration system was further articulated by Pauline, a transgender woman, who pointed to the exclusion and lack of recognition of transgender asylum seekers:   ‘The Immigration Service does not understand what is happening with trans people and what we have to go through. There is a difference between gay men and us, they have privileges […] It is hypocritical that they say there are rights for the LGBT community, but rights for who? Not everyone has the same rights. I have to fight all the time being a trans woman. This is not the same fight as for other LGBT people.’ (Pauline)   9  During Pauline’s interview with migration officers, she experienced that they had little knowledge about transgender people, that they used stereotypes, and that they mis-gendered her several times (referring to her as ‘he/him’), even after she explained to them that she identified with the pronoun ‘she’. It is not possible to know the exact division between men, women, cis gender and transgender individuals among LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, as these categories are not registered. However, the organisation LGBT Asylum, which assists and supports LGBTQ+ refugees, accounts for the gender and sexuality of their members. According to the organisation’s annual reports, in 2018 and 2019, two-thirds of their members were men, while one-third were women (LGBT Asylum, 2018, 2019).8 The ignorance about and invisibility of lesbian and transgender asylum seekers in our migration officer interviews raises concerns that asylum seekers who are not (cis) gay men might face more difficulty being recognised as ‘genuine’. Similarly, the online platform Grindr and media content such as gay porn, which are frequently used as evidence to determine verdicts, favour gay (cis) men. In our migration officer interviews, both Grindr and gay porn were repeatedly mentioned as media that could confirm or disconfirm applicants’ ‘genuine’ or ‘fraudulent’ LGBTQ+ status. Grindr advertises itself as ‘the largest social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people’ (Grindr, 2022), but it is actually a hook-up app that facilitates sexual encounters between men. While Grindr has members who identify as transgender (both transmen and transwomen), it is not geared towards – or designed to accommodate – lesbian women or women seeking sex with women; rather, Grindr is a sex app for men seeking sex with men, and its design reflects this aim (Mowlabocus, 2010; Møller & Nebeling Petersen, 2017). Thus, the use of Grindr to determine LGBTQ+ cases is limited in its scope, as it can only inform about gay male sex desires and potential meetings to fulfil such desires. Importantly, there are no similar applications or platforms for women desiring women; there are dating apps designed for heterosexual users that women can use to search for women instead of men (e.g. Tinder), but there are no explicitly sexual hook-up apps for women. Lewis (2013), who has researched lesbian refugees claiming asylum in the UK, argues: ‘The primary challenge facing lesbian asylum applicants is the lack of representational space within heteronormative asylum narratives for the articulation of female same-sex desire’ (2013:180). The Danish asylum system seems similarly lacking in representational space for lesbian refugees, in two respects: first, lesbians are invisible on the surveilled social media platforms; and second, they are not represented as imaginary figures by migration officers. This suggests a significant limitation of migration officers’ imaginaries of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, overall.  Furthermore, the practices of screening phones and reviewing online material in asylum evaluations point to expectations of sharing. While Payne (2015) and van Dijck (2013) write about the commercial imperatives of sharing and point to the hierarchical power imbedded in such imperatives, our interviews highlighted expected imperatives of sharing. That is, the migration officers expected refugees to ‘share’ their intimate sexual experiences online (see also Andreassen, 2021). But this expected imperative was a double-edged sword, as the sharing was used to evaluate refugees’ credibility. While some refugees might have accessed Grindr to find casual homosexual sex, others might have accessed Tinder to search for heterosexual sex in order to stay safe (by pretending to be heterosexual in an unsafe context); furthermore, some might have never used online media, either because they felt uncomfortable sharing or because they were not used to using online devices. During our interview with the asylum seeker and gay man Amir, he expressed a fear of using dating apps while living in the asylum camp. He was afraid of being ‘outed’ at the camp and he revealed that he could not concentrate on anything other than his case: ‘I am not really on the app right now because I just want to focus on my case in this moment. I just want to focus on myself’  10 (Amir). This indicates that not all LGBTQ+ asylum seekers have the same opportunities to ‘share’ online sexual experiences, either because the surveilled social media platforms are not relevant to them or because they perceive any distraction from their case as risky. Thus, the (im)mobility of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is informed by an uneven distribution and access to technological systems of proof (Urry, 2007), which are marked by classed, gendered and racialised dimensions.   Porn as evidence favours gay men The surveillance of asylum seekers’ phones often includes a targeted search for porn, which is used as a proxy for sexuality. One migration officer described: ‘The Immigration Service considers it problematic if people say they have a different sexual orientation than the porn that is being watched on their phone […] if one is a gay man, then one watches gay male porn’ (Louise). While the interviewed migration officers (e.g. Louise) also referred to non–gay male porn when reflecting on porn as an abstract category of evidence, when discussing actual cases, they only referred to gay male porn (and never, e.g., lesbian porn or porn portraying transgender individuals). Illustratively, one officer explained how porn was used in the assessment of cases: ‘If it is a man who says that he is into men, and then [we can see that] he has been watching heterosexual porn; then we will investigate that [because that is suspicious]’ (Anne). Again, lesbian and transgender asylum seekers are made invisible, in both words and imaginaries.  Studies on women and porn have underscored that women use and perceive porn in a wide variety of ways. However, a number of studies have noted that some women are not fond of porn, either because they find it unauthentic or because they are concerned about oppressive production conditions (Macleod, 2020; Parvez, 2006). Generally, more men than women consume porn, and men consume quantitatively more porn than women (Carroll et al., 2017; Frisch et al., 2017). Additionally, as much so-called ‘lesbian porn’ is created for male, heterosexual viewers, many women do not find it attractive or authentic (Morrison & Tallack, 2005). Some studies have found that women consume gay male porn with great enthusiasm (Ramsay, 2017), precisely because they consider it more authentic and less oppressive than heterosexual porn (McCutcheon & Bishop, 2015). The point here is that porn is not simply porn. Rather, consumption of porn differs from individual to individual, and from group to group. Consumption differences are further fuelled by availability, as the amount of gay male porn is much larger than the amount of lesbian porn (made for a lesbian audience); this makes it easier for gay men than for lesbian women to find porn they find authentic and arousing. Considering all of these factors, it is likely that more gay men than lesbian women will consume porn, also among LGBTQ+ refugees.  Lewis (2013, 2014) criticises the UK asylum system’s differential treatment of women and men in LGBTQ+ asylum cases, describing that the ‘political asylum system both assumes and reinforces the invisibility of lesbian migrants’ (2013:180). Similarly, the Danish practice of using Grindr and porn as evidence of an LGBTQ+ identity contributes to female/lesbian invisibility, while highlighting (cis) gay male homosexuality. While homosexuality is defined via sex and desire, transgender identity is not directly connected to sexual behaviour; rather, it pertains to gender identification. Transgender individuals might identify as heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or asexual. Thus, online activities driven by sexual desire are not good indicators of a transgender identity, and migration officers’ use of porn and Grindr histories to determine LGBTQ+ status illustrates an ignorance of transgender refugees.  Haas (2019) describes how the categories of ‘genuine’ migrants (i.e. political refugees) and ‘fraudulent’ migrants (i.e. economic migrants), through which decisions of asylum are navigated, are categories and imaginaries that are created within the asylum system. These categories do not mirror the lived experiences of refugees, nor do they capture the complexities and entanglement of – and mobility between – their economic and humanitarian needs. Similarly, the category of the  11 ‘genuine’ LGBTQ+ asylum seeker seems to be created within the Danish asylum system through migration officers’ imaginaries of LGBTQ+ refugees (as cis gay men). This particular category mirrors particular imaginaries of LGBTQ+ refugees as sexually active males who consume porn and engage in casual sex. This understanding is not only exclusionary for women and transgender refugees, but it also reflects a Western understanding of sexuality, involving the consumption of sexuality (e.g. via porn, hook-up apps or gay bars) (see also Dustin & Held, 2018; Held, 2019).   Conclusion  In this article, we have analysed how Danish migration officers utilise social media and phone content to determine LGBTQ+ asylum seekers’ credibility and access to asylum in Denmark. Because credibility is complicated and claims of LGBTQ+ identities are difficult to prove, asylum seekers’ phones and online activities are mined for ‘external’ and ‘objective’ documentation to confirm or disconfirm their claims. In this way, phones, accessed through surveillance, function as archives of information and evidence that can determine the ‘truth’ of applicants’ sexualities and gender identities.  The article has described how asylum seekers have to provide stringent, consistent narratives that fit a binary understanding of homosexuality versus heterosexuality. Thus, it is challenging for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers who identify as bisexual or pansexual, or who have fluid sexual practices, to be recognised as ‘genuine’ by migration officers. In order to be recognised as ‘true’ LGBTQ+ individuals, refugees must limit their mobility and orientate their sexual practices within restricted categories. However, some of the interviewed migration officers expressed an awareness that sexuality, sexual practices and sexual visual desires could be more fluid – and thereby more complex and ambivalent – than what is otherwise accommodated by the institution’s assessment guidelines. This implies that the system’s demand for simplicity (and restricted mobility) in the understanding of sexuality is somewhat challenged by individual migration officers.  Further, the article has shown how migration officers conceptualise LGBTQ+ asylum seekers as (cis) gay men. Not only do the officers employ ‘he’ as the default pronoun for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, but they also focus their search of applicants’ phones to dating apps such as Grindr and porn, which favour gay (cis) men. Thus, lesbian and transgender asylum seekers have little representation, limited visibility and few opportunities to ‘prove’ their identities through online platforms. Drawing on the field of mobility research, the article has highlighted how the (im)mobility of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is restricted by technological barriers that operate to enhance the mobility of some while reinforcing the immobility of others. The (im)mobility of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers is thus structured through technological surveillance that manages mobility according to gendered and sexed exclusions.

PhD Thesis, York University, Canada.   1 Marie Lunau has gathered the empirical interviews; Marie Lunau and Rikke Andreassen have collectively made the analyses and written the article. 2 Migration officers interview and assess asylum cases for the Danish Immigration Service (Udlændingestyrelsen). They are academically educated but not necessarily from a legal background.  3 LGBTQ+ is an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. In adding the +, we include anyone who identifies in-between the mentioned categories (e.g. as pansexual, intersex, asexual, etc.). 4 We use the term ‘queer’ as a term to denote non-normative identities. In using queer, we are referring to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, as well as other non-heterosexual and non–cis gendered people. 5 In Denmark, the asylum process is two-tiered and managed by two different authorities. The Immigration Service is responsible for assessing asylum claims in the first instance. If they reject a claim for asylum, the case is automatically referred to the Refugees Appeals Board. At this stage, the applicant is appointed an attorney while the case is pending (The Refugee Appeals Board, 2022). 6 While all types of asylum seekers potentially can get their phones screened for additional forms of evidence, LGBTQ+ asylum seekers are routinely asked to submit their phones.  7 Although immigration officers only mention the asylum seeker as the gay cis man, it does not necessarily mean that they do not have an awareness of or experience with multiple identities, such as trans people and lesbian woman, in LGBTQ+ asylum claims.  8 While LGBT Asylum is in contact with many LGBT+ asylum seekers in Denmark, they are not in contact with all asylum seekers claiming asylum because of sexuality or gender identity. However, the demographics of their membership are indicative of a general pattern. In 2020, LGBT Asylum changed their recording practices to include trans people in                                                   15                                                                                                                                                                   the gender division. They reported: ‘Almost three out of four identify as men (cis/trans) and a bit more than one fourth as women (cis/trans)’ (LGBT Asylum, 2020:17). ",
