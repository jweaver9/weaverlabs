L. REV. 1305 (2023) FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY AND THE NEW PARENTAL RIGHTS LAWS* MAXINE EICHNER** How can government best support children’s interests? Recently, federal and state policies have suggested conflicting answers to this question. One answer comes from a series of economic measures supporting families that were passed by Congress during the pandemic. These measures rested on the rationale that families do better when they are buffered from the market. A second answer has emerged from the many states that have passed “parental rights” bills restricting children’s education in public schools. Supporters of these measures contend that children do better when their parents are given broad authority to rear them. This Article juxtaposes the family economic support measures with parental rights laws. It shows that these two sorts of policies were developed to respond to different pressures and problems and are likely to have very different impacts on children as a result. Specifically, family economic supports responded to the significant economic hardship experienced by U.S. families during the pandemic and produced demonstrable and significant benefits for children’s well-being. In contrast, recent parental rights measures are motivated by a convergence of interests among political elites seeking partisan gain and voters expressing cultural backlash against progressive change and their threatened loss of privilege. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given their origins, these measures appear likely to stymy both children’s well-being and their adequate education for citizenship. The fact that parental rights measures appear likely to become long-lasting fixtures of American law while family economic supports were largely withdrawn as the pandemic waned should therefore cause alarm for those who support children’s best interests.  Part I discusses the weakness of the United States’ free-market family policy before and during the pandemic, and the effectiveness of the emergency economic measures provided to families during the COVID-19 outbreak in supporting children’s well-being. Part II describes the more recent rise in proposed state measures to safeguard parental rights from government. Part III argues that the new parental rights measures harm children and overstep the important but   *  © 2023 Maxine Eichner.  **  Graham Kenan Distinguished Professor of Law, University of North Carolina School of Law; J.D., Ph.D. 101 N.C.

For many Americans, the private stream of income the United States expects them to rely on to support their families ran dry, as stores, restaurants, and other service establishments shuttered their doors, and warehouses and offices closed or cut back hours, leaving employees   1.

Overall in 2020, the income of one in six families with children dropped below the U.S. poverty line.4 Worse still, in late June 2020, at the peak of the economic disruption, almost one in five children—about fourteen million children—were not even getting enough to eat because their families simply could not afford to buy food.5 By early September 2021, almost one in four renters (twenty-three percent) living with children reported that they were behind on rent.6 The disastrous consequences of the U.S. free-market family approach in the face of the pandemic caused Congress to take unprecedented steps to support U.S. families.7 In 2020 and 2021, Congress passed a series of measures to ensure that American families had the cash and conditions they needed to thrive, regardless of their market earnings: It provided a weekly federal   2.

And, as the pandemic continued, in 2021, Congress approved monthly checks to most families with children for the first time in the nation’s history.12 Congress framed all these public actions, however, as temporary measures to allow families to weather the extraordinary economic conditions of the pandemic.13 The question that remained was whether measures like these would, or should, become more permanent changes in the nation’s public policy. In the pandemic’s second year, the Biden administration and many congressional Democrats pushed for public supports for families going forward, including continued child-benefit checks, universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds, a cap on childcare costs, paid family and sick leave, expanded free school meals, and money for affordable home and rental assistance.14 The administration’s “Build Back Better” measure, however, failed to make it through the equally divided Senate, despite a push by the administration and congressional Democrats in the fall of 2021.15   8.

L. REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1309 At about the same time that federal efforts to institute permanent economic supports for families failed, politicians in many states were beginning to propose and pass very different kinds of measures that they asserted were needed to support families.16 These legislators equated support for families with giving parents the right to dictate what their children learn in school about particular issues.17 Some of these measures, like the Florida law informally called the “Don’t Say Gay” law, prohibit teachers in early grades from discussing issues of sexual orientation and gender identity and in later grades prohibit these issues from being discussed in ways that are “not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate”—language some believe is deliberately vague to chill discussion of these issues.18 Some of these laws also give parents greater rights in being notified about children’s mental health and well-being.19 The Parents’ Bill of Rights passed by the North Carolina Senate contains a similar bar on teaching issues of sexual orientation or gender identity to young children and would also require schools to notify parents if any student, regardless of grade, begins to question their gender identity in school, including if a student asks to use a different name or pronoun to describe themselves.20 Still other measures ban the teaching of “divisive” concepts such as so-called “critical race theory” (“CRT”).21 Finally, some measures ban school boards from imposing mask mandates or vaccine requirements to allow parents to make their own decisions about masking and vaccinations for their children in schools.22  2021, 7:23 PM), https://www.npr.org/2021/12/16/1064927774/democrats-forced-to-regroup-as-bidens-signature-spending-bill-stalls [https://perma.cc/S35P-VXTH].  16.

REV. 1305 (2023) 1310 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101 This Article juxtaposes these two very different types of measures—economic supports for families versus parental rights measures in schools. Advocates of each type of measure claim their programs position the government to support families and children in important ways. Yet, as this Article shows, these two measures respond to very different pressures and problems and, partly as a result, produce very different impacts on the well-being of children. Specifically, family economic supports respond to the real and significant economic hardship experienced by U.S. families in today’s economy. The family economic supports installed during the pandemic offered a test case in how effectively these measures would allay economic hardship, producing demonstrable and significant benefits for children’s well-being. In contrast, recent parental rights measures, this Article suggests, are motivated less by responding to real needs of children than by the confluence of interests among libertarian elites seeking to siphon political pressure away from adopting family economic supports, Republican politicians reaching for their next wedge issue to motivate their base and swing voters, and less educated voters enacting backlash in response to perceived threats to their position in the social hierarchy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given these motivations, parental rights measures may provide some psychic benefits to their supporters, but they are unlikely to produce demonstrable benefits for children. The opposite is likely true: by targeting vulnerable children, they are likely to produce significant harm. Furthermore, these measures violate government’s responsibility to ensure that children develop the capacities to choose their own course in life and to become citizens capable of collective self-rule in a liberal democracy.23 For those interested in children’s well-being and the well-being of the country, the fact that implementation of family economic supports at present appear to have been confined to the first years of the pandemic, and that parental rights laws appear as if they will have a longer-term impact, should therefore be treated with grave concern. Part I describes the weakness of the United States’ free-market family policy before and during the pandemic, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the emergency economic supports provided to families during the pandemic. Part II discusses the more recent rise in proposed state measures to safeguard parental rights from government. Part II also contextualizes the parental rights  (2022)); Act of Nov. 12, 2021, ch. 6, 2021 Tenn. Pub. Acts 1, 4–7 (codified at TENN. CODE ANN. §§ 14-2-101 to -104 (2021)).  23. I use the term “liberal democracy” to refer to the form of government we have in the United States, which focuses on rule by the majority combined with a strong emphasis on liberty, self-government, and the equal worth of citizens. My use of the term “liberal” is therefore broader than its use in common parlance to refer to those who hold liberal political beliefs. Those at both ends of our political spectrum, conservative Republicans as well as Democrats, hold commitments to liberal democracy. 101 N.C. L. REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1311 campaign as a concerted, elite-driven effort to undermine much-needed reform of free-market family policy, which operationalizes sentiments of cultural backlash. Part III argues that the new parental rights measures harm children and overstep the important but limited authority that parents should properly wield vis-à-vis government to the detriment of both children and the civic health of our democracy. I.  U.S. FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY AND THE NEED FOR FAMILY ECONOMIC SUPPORTS In a previous work, I demonstrated that U.S. family policy is constructed on the expectation that families will privately supply the resources, services, and conditions that family members need to thrive, largely without the assistance of government.24 This part begins by summarizing that earlier discussion of free-market family policy and its shortcomings, focusing particularly on the failure of free-market family policy to provide adequate and consistent support for children’s well-being. It then moves on to discuss how the economic dislocation caused by the pandemic caused such a massive disruption of private earnings and inflicted so much widespread suffering that it finally caused the federal government to roll back this misguided policy and to deliver a stream of public funding and other supports to families. Unfortunately, despite having demonstrated significant benefits for children’s well-being, this part closes by detailing the defeat of the federal Build Back Better plan, which would have continued these measures beyond the pandemic. A. The Failures of U.S. Free-Market Family Policy in Normal Economic Circumstances The expectation embedded in U.S. family policy that families should privately supply the economic resources their members need makes the country an outlier among wealthy countries.25 Every other wealthy democracy has built systems premised on the idea that families do their best when they receive public, as well as private, support.26 The United States is the only wealthy democracy that does not provide parents child benefit checks to help ensure that children’s needs for steady economic support are consistently met.27 In contrast with others, it has not developed any large-scale system to provide,   24.

The first shift relates to massive increases in economic inequality. Between 1973 and 2015, even as earnings among the top fifth of workers skyrocketed, the hourly wages of the two-thirds of men without college diplomas between the ages of twenty-five to fifty-four dropped eighteen percent in real dollars.31 Further, the drop in the real value of the minimum wage in these decades and the large increase in the number of low-wage service jobs in the U.S. economy mean that far more jobs do not pay nearly enough to support a family. Almost a third of those in the workforce today make less than twelve dollars an hour, and few in these low-wage jobs receive benefits.32 Many of these workers have children, and no matter how hard or long they work, they   28.

The income gap between the median Black and white household has lingered at about sixty percent for decades.34 Meanwhile, the median Hispanic household earns only seventy-four percent of the median white household.35 Disparities in families’ wealth have also mushroomed in the last five decades. Today, families in just the top one percent hold roughly twice as much wealth as those in the entire bottom ninety percent.36 To make matters worse, the drop in net worth of households headed by adults younger than thirty-five—the families most likely to have young kids—has been particularly steep. In 1984, the median net worth of these younger households in 2010 dollars was $11,521; in 2009, it was $3,662.37 Families headed by single mothers must also deal with the gender wage gap. Women, as a group, make eighty-two cents for every dollar men make.38 For Black women, that figure drops to sixty-two cents.39 The second shift undercutting parents’ ability to provide for their children is the steep rise in economic insecurity in the past five decades. Much of this increased insecurity comes from private companies offloading risks they once   33.

Most support comes in the form of two tax benefits: the Child Tax Credit48 and the Earned Income Tax Credit.49 The Child Tax Credit gives most U.S. families a yearly tax credit of up to $2,000.50 Because it is not fully refundable, however, the lowest-earning families, including twenty-seven million children, cannot get the full benefit of the credit.51 The Earned Income Tax Credit, while specifically aimed at low-income families, is geared towards incentivizing work rather than ensuring that children’s needs are met. Low-income families in which a parent works, accordingly, receive a refundable tax credit that pays out most in the amount at which a minimum-wage worker would earn in a year, and that decreases above that rate.52 But the program does not ensure that even children’s   45.

In 1979, 82 in 100 poor families received cash benefits.54 Today a majority of states require income below half the amount of the poverty line to be eligible for cash benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (“TANF”), and most of these programs require income below thirty percent of the poverty line.55 Further, under federal law, every state must set a lifetime TANF cap for families of five years or less;56 some states have set the cap at as few as twelve months.57 Roughly a third of states also cap or reduce TANF benefits on the birth of a new child if the family was receiving benefits when the child was born.58 The result of TANF’s restrictions and exclusions is that only twenty-one percent of poor families nationally receive benefits.59 And, the few families declared eligible for benefits will receive little help: in two-thirds of states, their benefits will not raise them to even a third of the poverty line.60 Moreover, despite the steep rise in rents  CTR.

A 2017 comparative study concluded that the United States had by far the highest rate of young children living in relative poverty of the sixteen wealthy countries that were compared: twenty-one percent.62 Nearly half of U.S. single-mother families—forty-six percent—were poor.63 And U.S. families headed by Black, Hispanic, or Native American women were disproportionately likely to be poor.64 Even when comparing poverty rates based on an absolute poverty standard (a standard that defines deprivation without taking the wealth of the country into account), the United States fared poorly, dropping only to a fourteen percent poverty rate for young children—a startlingly high rate for the world’s wealthiest country.65 Even families above the poverty line cannot afford to provide the circumstances that research shows are most important for children to do their best.66 This contrasts with other wealthy countries, which subsidize or provide these circumstances so that most or all children can access them.67 For example, the median length of maternity leave that U.S. women who work report taking is less than eleven weeks, as opposed to the almost eleven months taken in Finland (which subsidizes this leave), despite research showing that such short leaves are subpar for infants’ development.68 And, when U.S. children wind up in daycare, fewer than ten percent of them are placed in care rated “very high quality”; the majority of daycare U.S. children receive is rated either “fair” or “poor” by experts.69 Finally, while research makes it clear that children benefit   61.

The monthly child benefit payments reached sixty-one million children—roughly eighty-four percent of all U.S. children.87 The Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University calculated that the first payment in July of 2021 lifted three million children out of poverty—representing a twenty-five percent cut in the monthly child poverty rate.88 After the second payment, the number of households with children who did not have enough to eat fell by one-third, or nearly 3.3 million, based on Census Bureau data.89 The most striking result of the expanded benefits to families during the pandemic is not that they eased the poverty of the many families in economic crisis during the pandemic, but that they lowered child poverty rates significantly below prepandemic rates.

As economically painful as the crisis was, the aggressive public spending passed across the Trump and Biden presidencies dramatically mitigated the hardship Americans suffered.90 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ (“CBPP”) analysis showed that child poverty fell sharply in 2021 and reached a record low of 5.2%, as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure (“SPM”).91 That figure, the CBPP found, is the lowest figure on record dating back to 1967.92 In comparison, in 2018, 13.7% of children fell below the SPM poverty line.93 CBPP concluded that the year-to-year decline in the child poverty rate was the largest ever on record.94 The significance of such a steep reduction of poverty within a year to the well-being of U.S. children is, as the Brookings Institution put it, “hard to overstate.”95 The Child Tax Credit expansion was the largest driver of this decrease. The CBPP reported that “[i]n the absence of the expansion, child poverty would have fallen to 8.1 percent, rather than 5.2 percent, and some 2.1 million more children would have lived in families with incomes below the poverty line.”96 The drop in the poverty rate for Black children was particularly stunning: in 2018, nearly one in four children lived in families below the poverty line; in 2021, fewer than one in ten did.97 Yet all these measures were temporary: The pandemic relief checks were characterized as one-time cash payments.98 The mandatory paid family leave   90.

During the pandemic, policies aimed at providing economic relief to families amidst the crises demonstrated the capacity for public supports to remedy this failure.

REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1323 has shifted away from addressing children’s well-being through needed and effective economic support to addressing alleged threats to children’s well-being through parental rights measures. II.  THE RISE OF PARENTAL RIGHTS LAWS AS PRO-FAMILY REFORM As the battle to institute permanent family economic supports was waged in Congress, the conversation outside of congressional halls over what families needed from government shifted. Increasingly, this new conversation began to focus on parental autonomy rather than on public economic supports. This part discusses the rising number of parental rights laws being proposed and adopted in states. It argues that this shift should be viewed as an attempt by elite conservatives to avoid much needed economic family supports and to develop a wedge issue that would motivate both base and swing voters to vote for Republican politicians. This elite effort has been extremely effective in generating support by tapping into older voters’ sentiments of cultural backlash, in which they react with resentment, anger, and fear in response to emerging demographic and cultural changes among younger generations. A. The Parental Rights Campaign In November 2021, Glenn Youngkin pulled off an upset in the Virginia governor’s race, beating former governor Terry McAuliffe. The fact that Youngkin won in a state that was increasingly seen as Democratic—no Republican had won statewide office in a dozen years—caused heads to turn.106 Particularly stunning were the issues on which Youngkin centered his winning campaign: shoring up parental rights in schools.107 Youngkin repeatedly hammered his opponent for a statement McAuliffe made debating parents’ authority to keep controversial books off school bookshelves: “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.”108 In pushing back, Youngkin argued for a broad platform of parental rights. The candidate contended that parents, not the schools, should decide their children’s pandemic precautions, and therefore opposed school systems’ mask mandates, vaccination   106.

His hallmark campaign pledge was to ban the teaching of what he called “CRT” in schools on his first day in office.110 He kept that promise, issuing an executive order that banned the teaching of CRT and other “inherently divisive concepts” in public schools.111 Subsequently, Youngkin’s Board of Education issued policies giving the last word to parents on what names, nicknames, and pronouns should be used for students by teachers and school staff; and whether their child could express a gender different from their child’s sex.112 The last time parental rights wielded significant heft as a political issue was in between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s, when Christian evangelicals contested sex education programs in schools.113 Passage during the Reagan administration of the Adolescent Family and Life Act, which encouraged abstinence-only sex education and prohibited discussion of abortion, energized this movement.114 In the 1990s, the mantle of parental rights expanded to include pushback on schools’ efforts to become more LGBT-inclusive.115 In 1994, the GOP’s legislative agenda, “Contract with America,” included a broad statement about parents’ rights to control their children’s education.116 Two years later, though, the crushing defeat of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have explicitly installed parental rights in the Colorado Constitution effectively killed the movement for a quarter of a century.117 In 2021, Youngkin was the first candidate to ride a new wave of parental rights enthusiasm to statewide success, a wave that was just beginning to swell when he jumped on.118 Over the course of 2021, and into 2022, more than   109.

Some measures, like Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” law, focus on limiting discussions of sexuality, gender identity, and sexual orientation.121 Some would require schools to flag sexually explicit content in curriculum and library materials to give parents the ability to opt their child out from exposure.122 Others aim to ban the teaching of CRT and other “divisive concepts.”123 An Indiana bill, for example, regulates the teaching of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, and political affiliation,124 and an Oklahoma law prohibits teachers from telling students that an individual is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive by virtue of their race or sex.125 B. The Elite Push Behind Parental Rights At first blush, the new push for parental rights may appear the product of a grass-roots movement, but in truth, much of it was orchestrated by a network of elite right-wing actors.126 As journalist Jane Mayer and political scientist Alexander Hertel-Fernandez have separately pointed out, conservative activists and donors like the Koch brothers have, over the last five decades, constructed a powerful infrastructure to advance coordinated efforts to undermine   119.

One important role that the conservative network played was in popularizing and weaponizing the term “critical race theory.” As The New Yorker reported, the term was activated for right-wing purposes by conservative journalist and activist Christopher Rufo.128 In the summer of 2020, Rufo was scrutinizing literature from anti-racism work trainings conducted following the Black Lives Matter protests when he discovered references to literature from the academic movement by that name dating back to the 1990s legal academy.129 That earlier movement, of whom prominent scholars included Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and Angela Davis, argued that racism was a structural feature of American life and law.130 Rufo correctly suspected that the term could become a potent weapon for conservative activists.131 As he explained: “Political correctness” is a dated term and, more importantly, doesn’t apply anymore. It’s not that elites are enforcing a set of manners and cultural limits, they’re seeking to reengineer the foundation of human psychology and social institutions through the new politics of race\t.\t.\t.\t. The other frames are wrong, too: “[C]ancel culture” is a vacuous term and doesn’t translate into a political program; “woke” is a good epithet, but it’s too broad, too terminal, too easily brushed aside. “Critical race theory” is the perfect villain.132 Rufo added: “Strung together, the phrase ‘critical race theory’ connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.”133 Once Rufo used the term “critical race theory” in an online article for the magazine of the Manhattan Institute, one of the many right-wing think tanks associated with the Koch network, other conservative elites swung into action. In early September, Tucker Carlson invited Rufo for an interview on FOX News, a major player in the conservative infrastructure.134 President Trump then invited Rufo to the White House, and subsequently issued an executive   127.

As the Washington Post reported, “a conservative network built on the scaffolding of the Koch fortune and the largesse of other GOP megadonors” helped organize parents to argue that it was their “parental right” to decide if their children should wear masks.141 The Independent Women’s Network was a key player in building support for this movement, circulating a model letter to its members and suggesting they send it to their schools to oppose masking and vaccination requirements.142 After Youngkin’s win, the same group placed a supportive op-ed in the Washington Post.143 Despite the organization’s nonpartisan name, a former board chair noted that it constituted a unique tool in the “Republican conservative arsenal” because, “[b]eing branded as neutral but actually having the people who know, know that you’re actually conservative puts us in a unique position.”144   135.

As Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth professor who studies politics and the Religious Right put it, “They have an interest in keeping the base riled up about one thing or another, and when one issue fades, as with same-sex relationships and same-sex marriage, they’ve got to find something else.”146 And it is not just the base. Republican strategists found that once they added issues of trans students in bathrooms and on sports teams to the mix of issues they were pushing, they developed a useful wedge issue to which conservative Democrats and independents approvingly responded.147 Put another way, Republicans and their big-money conservative networks believe that using hot-button racial and LGBTQ issues as a wedge will draw enough working-class voters to win elections that will enable them to block economic legislation.148 They are using these issues to motivate this bloc of voters to vote against their economic interests at the expense of economic supports that would provide tangible benefits to their families. Using these wedge issues to circumvent passage of reforms that would greatly benefit families has a considerable amount in common with the phenomenon that Thomas Frank described two decades ago in his book, What’s the Matter with Kansas?

In Ezra Klein’s words, For decades, the Republican Party has been an awkward alliance between a donor class that wants deregulation and corporate tax breaks and entitlement cuts and guest workers and an ethnonationalist grass roots that resents the way the country is diversifying, urbanizing, liberalizing and secularizing.

Some of Frank’s argument is now outdated. Since Donald Trump’s candidacy and then presidency, as well as the rise of powerful, ethnonationalist media companies, the Republican party has reached an uneasy rebalance between its libertarian and ethnonationalist wings that allows significant policy victories to the latter, including on immigration and abortion.152 The new parental rights measures are a win for both wings of the party insofar as they elect right-wing politicians who will oppose family economic supports—the payoff for libertarian elites—and directly express the ethnonationalist motivations that drive the other wing of the party. As discussed in the next section, the expressive features of these measures mean that the many voters who support these measures are indeed receiving payoffs, in contrast to the Kansans that Frank described, even if these payoffs involve psychic benefits to voters and parents rather than economic benefits to families. Regardless, much of Frank’s point still holds when it comes to family policy: a network of conservative elites has used parental rights measures to siphon off energy for badly needed economic reforms for U.S. families. C. Voter Support for Parental Rights Elites advocating parental rights argue that these measures are the family supports that U.S. families truly need.153 In doing so, they make arguments similar to those made by advocates of family economic supports.

As NBC put it, “the 12-point gap Republicans enjoyed in 2020 among white women who didn’t go to college grew to a 49 point gulf Tuesday, with Youngkin winning the demographic 74 to 25 percent.”157 Observers attributed the swing to Youngkin’s focus on parental rights in public schools.158 The women in this key demographic, however, are among those who stand much to gain from economic policy supports for families. The median household income in 2020 for households of high school graduates was only $47,400.159 Yet the average annual cost of infant care in Virginia was $14,063 and the average cost of childcare for a four-year-old was $10,867.160 This means that Virginia parents with two preschool-aged children would spend roughly $25,000—more than half of the income of a household of high school graduates—simply to get good quality daycare for their children. The Build Back Better Measure, with monthly child benefit checks, caps on childcare costs, and universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds would have vastly benefited these families. Nevertheless, these voters voted enthusiastically for Youngkin’s parental rights platform. At least when it comes to the centerpiece of Youngkin’s parental rights measures—banning the teaching of CRT—Virginia parents stood little to gain in terms of policy. As NBC News observed: “There’s little evidence critical race theory [was] even taught in Virginia schools\t.\t.\t.\t.”161 To the extent the term was being used to describe a real phenomenon, it had been misappropriated to push   154.

No credible evidence suggests that children’s well-being will benefit from these parental-rights measures; indeed, as discussed in the next section, such changes will likely harm children. Rather than being directed at addressing actual needs, these measures are better viewed as motivated by cultural backlash. Political scientists have begun to pay significant attention to this phenomenon recently. As Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart describe, beginning in the 1970s, as opportunities for college education increased and one generation replaced another, there has been a shift in wealthy countries toward a more progressive culture.163 This shift has in turn triggered a backlash among older generations and less educated sectors “who sense decline and actively reject the rising tide of progressive values, resent the displacement of familiar traditional norms,” and “react angrily to the erosion of their privileges and status.”164 This cultural pushback against what they call “Cosmopolitan Liberalism,” Norris and Inglehart argue, better explains voters’ shift to populist candidates like Donald Trump than do explanations based on voters’ economic insecurity.165 Space constraints prevent a thorough explication of the argument that Youngkin’s use of parental rights successfully tapped into backlash sentiments. However, the fact that the parental rights campaign focused on resisting education seeking to eradicate racism and white privilege, as well as on rejecting policies supporting the dignity of LGBTQ persons and the mutability of gender—two major cultural shifts that sought to topple the traditional status systems in which Virginia voters were raised—in combination   162.

Perhaps ironically, given working-class whites’ votes against CRT in Virginia, one of the founders of the CRT movement, Derrick Bell, four decades ago made observations that illuminate Virginia’s voting patterns today. Bell described poorer whites motivated by their deeply-felt expectation “that white elites would maintain lower class whites in a societal status superior to that designated for blacks.”166 In particular, Bell observed, less-educated whites in the years after Brown v. Board of Education167 particularly feared loss of control over their public schools.168 The result was that poorer whites could be motivated to vote against their economic interests despite the fact that they would be better served by the same programs that would benefit Black Americans.169 These same motivations may still be at work today. In summary, in the last few years, parental rights have eclipsed economic supports in the conversation over what U.S. families need. Yet evidence suggests that this shift is not motivated by the well-being of children or families, but rather because it serves the interests of right-wing economic elites and is supported by voters motivated to express backlash. Unfortunately, the parental rights measures instituted as a result have considerable costs for children’s well-being, autonomy, and the health of our nation. III.  THE HARMS INFLICTED BY PARENTAL RIGHTS MEASURES The parental rights measures passed in several states and proposed in many more do not simply constitute detours away from measures that would greatly benefit the nation’s children: they create considerable harms and risks through violating the appropriate relationships among parents, children, and government. In our liberal democratic system of government,170 although parents have considerable authority to raise children and to make decisions for them, parental authority is properly not unlimited. The state, too, necessarily has a significant responsibility to children.171 Three of the state’s responsibilities   166. Derrick A. Bell, Jr., Brown v.

This Article will not consider the extent to which the government has the responsibility to exercise these responsibilities for children outside of public schools. 101 N.C. L. REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1333 to children in our system of government are undermined by the new parental rights laws: (1) the state’s duty to support children’s well-being;172 (2) government’s responsibility to ensure that children develop a baseline level of autonomy as they reach adulthood;173 and (3) the state’s obligations to ensure that youth are prepared to assume the mantle of collective self-government.174 The new parental rights measures curtail the state’s ability to fulfill each of these important responsibilities. A. The Government’s Responsibility To Support Children’s Well-Being In our system of government, we allow parents broad authority to make decisions for their children based on liberal democracy’s deep respect for people’s rights to pursue their own life plan, including raising children. This basic principle was first recognized a century ago by the Supreme Court, in its decisions in Meyer v. Nebraska175 and Pierce v. Society of Sisters.176 In Pierce, the Court overturned a state statute requiring that children between eight and sixteen years old be sent to public schools on the ground that it “unreasonably interfere[d] with the liberty of parents\t.\t.\t. to direct the upbringing and education of [their] children.”177 In the Court’s words,  The fundamental theory of liberty\t.\t.\t. excludes any general power of the state to standardize its children\t.\t.\t.\t. The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.178  More recently, in Troxel v. Granville,179 the Supreme Court reaffirmed parents’ decision-making rights for their children.180 In Justice O’Connor’s words,  [S]o long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children (i.e., is fit), there will normally be no reason for the State to inject itself into the private realm of the family to further question the ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent’s children.181   172.

REV. 1305 (2023) 1334 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 101 Parents’ fundamental right to make decisions on behalf of their children is also founded on the recognition that respecting parental decision-making generally better serves children’s welfare than does a vigorous platform of state intervention.182 The fact of the matter is that parents are generally well motivated to act in children’s interests. Bearing and rearing a child is certainly not a guarantee that parents will love their children and look out after their interests; in most instances, however, it works out that way. In a culture like ours in which there is a strong expectation that individuals will put their own interests first, the extent to which most parents will sacrifice their own welfare for their children’s is remarkable. Parents will work for years in jobs they despise in order to put food on the dinner table or pay for health care for their children. They will work second and sometimes third jobs to enable their children to get the best education that they can obtain. In addition, on most issues, the state is not generally better positioned to second-guess parents’ decisions. The state can ascertain whether children have what they need to achieve some minimal standard of development—for example, that they have adequate food, shelter, and supervision. Over and above this threshold, however, it becomes far more difficult for the state to say what is in children’s best interests. Furthermore, most decisions about children above this basic threshold require knowledge about the individual child and are, therefore, better made by parents than the state. Yet parents’ authority is not unlimited. It has long been recognized that the state, too, has its own responsibilities to children and the polity that properly limit parental rights. One of these responsibilities, which is often referred to by courts as the government’s parens patriae function, is to support children’s well-being. This responsibility runs concurrently with parents’ own responsibility to support children’s well-being, and sometimes requires limiting parental authority. As the Supreme Court has stated, “[A] state is not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when their physical or mental health is jeopardized.”183 The most obvious occasion on which the state exercises its responsibility to safeguard children’s well-being is in abuse or neglect cases, when the state may decide to remove custody altogether from parents deemed to violate their responsibility to support children’s well-being.184   182. See MAXINE EICHNER, THE SUPPORTIVE STATE: FAMILIES, GOVERNMENT, AND AMERICA’S POLITICAL IDEAS 71–90 (2010) [hereinafter EICHNER, THE SUPPORTIVE STATE]; see also Clare Huntington & Elizabeth Scott, The Enduring Importance of Parental Rights, 90 FORDHAM L.

See id. at 602–03. 101 N.C. L. REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1335 The government’s authority to support children’s well-being, though, is often exercised in less drastic ways than through removing children from parents’ custody. To take one example, the Supreme Court has for generations declared that the state can impose labor restrictions on children in their parents’ custody, even when such laws violate their parents’ religious beliefs. In the seminal case of Prince v. Massachusetts,185 Justice Jackson described the government’s power to enforce its mandates over parental objections: On one side is the obviously earnest claim for freedom of conscience and religious practice. With it is allied the parent’s claim to authority in her own household and in the rearing of her children.\t.\t.\t. Against these sacred private interests, basic in a democracy, stand the interests of society to protect the welfare of children, and the state’s assertion of authority to that end, made here in a manner conceded valid if only secular things were involved.\t.\t.\t. It is the interest of youth itself, and of the whole community, that children be both safeguarded from abuses and given opportunities for growth into free and independent well-developed men and citizens.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t.\t. Acting to guard the general interest in youth’s well-being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent’s control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child’s labor, and in many other ways. Its authority is not nullified merely because the parent grounds his claim to control the child’s course of conduct on religion or conscience. Thus, he cannot claim freedom from compulsory vaccination for the child more than for himself on religious grounds. The right to practice religion freely does not include liberty to expose the community or the child to communicable disease or the latter to ill health or death. The catalogue need not be lengthened. It is sufficient to show what indeed appellant hardly disputes, that the state has a wide range of power for limiting parental freedom and authority in things affecting the child’s welfare; and that this includes, to some extent, matters of conscience and religious conviction.186 In the Court’s construction of the appropriate division of power, even while children remain in their parents’ custody, the state’s responsibility to protect children’s well-being authorizes substantial restrictions on parental freedom.187 The Supreme Court has long recognized that a key place in which the state may exercise its responsibilities for children is in public schools, and that this exercise may appropriately limit parental rights. Even as it made its first   185. 321 U.S. 158 (1944).  186. Id. at 165–67 (citations omitted).  187. See id. 101 N.C. L.

Yoder,189 arguably the case in which the Court paid the most deference to parents’ rights to raise children in accord with their own views, the Court announced that “[t]here is no doubt as to the power of a State, having a high responsibility for education of its citizens, to impose reasonable regulations for the control and duration of basic education. Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the function of a State.”190 Schools are a particularly good place for the government to exercise its responsibility to support children’s well-being vis-à-vis parents because doing so minimizes interference inside the home, the zone in which family privacy has its strongest claim.191 Courts have made clear that parents’ rights to convey their own views to their children does not allow them to keep public schools from conveying lessons that educators believe children should receive, even when parents disagree. In the influential case of Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of Education,192 the Sixth Circuit rejected parents’ assertion that their rights to free exercise entitled them to remove their children from a reading program they deemed objectionable.193 The students’ exposure to ideas that their parents disagreed with, the Court held, did not constitute an infringement of the parents’ free exercise rights.194 The lesson: public schools have the legitimate authority to adopt curriculum they believe is in students’ interests whether or not parents disagree. Consistent with this reasoning, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland noted that parents’ “constitutional right to teach their children about sexual matters in their own homes” did not prohibit the state from teaching sex education in schools.195 Furthermore, the fact that parents deem a particular curriculum to be morally, or even religiously,   188.

This is perhaps most obviously the case with respect to laws that prohibit schools from requiring immunizations against COVID-19 and other diseases, policies designed to protect children’s health. Public health professionals have already shown clearly how allowing parents to decide if their own children are masked and vaccinated for the coronavirus, instead of requiring such measures for all students, produces worse outcomes for children’s well-being, particularly those with chronic health issues and other health vulnerabilities.197 Similarly, prohibiting discussion of same-sex sexual orientation and gender identity issues in early grades and chilling discussion in later grades through vaguely worded requirements that such discussion be “age appropriate” also undermine the well-being of LGBTQ youth. Few groups are more vulnerable than this. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people aged ten to thirty-four,198 and LGBTQ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide as their peers.199 Rates of suicide attempts are even   196.

They are therefore important issues over which schools should exercise their authority to support children’s well-being. A significant problem with the way that the parens patriae doctrine has developed in U.S. law, however, is that courts have framed this doctrine as a negative right rather than a positive responsibility: Existing doctrine authorizes public schools to intervene to support children’s well-being, even over the objection of parents. Yet that doctrine creates no affirmative responsibility for the state to do so. Because of this, parental rights laws effectively stymie the ability of public schools to support children’s well-being. In effect, these laws are allowing a group of voters to   207. See JOSEPH G.

A few scholars have noted the need in U.S. law for more muscular articulation of the state’s responsibility to support children.212 Parental rights laws are a clear and pressing example of why development of such a positive responsibility in U.S. law is necessary to support American children. B. The Government’s Responsibility To Develop a Baseline Level of Autonomy in Children Parental autonomy laws also encroach on a second governmental obligation: ensuring that children achieve at least a baseline level of autonomy by the time they reach adulthood. This responsibility derives from the same belief that grounds our system’s deference to parental rights: liberalism’s commitment to the principle that one’s identity, commitments, and life plans are, on some basic level, “owned” by the person who holds them and are therefore entitled to respect.213 When the next generation of children become adults, for their own life plans to deserve respect, they must also be able to own them in some meaningful sense. Achieving this level of autonomy requires more than that children have formal choices about how to live their lives when they become adults, but also that they have developed sufficient autonomy to be able to make these genuine choices. Insofar as parents claim that their views about their children are entitled to respect, these claims cannot be used to deny their children the same capacity to choose their own paths when they reach adulthood: in a liberal democracy, one person cannot be permitted simply to serve as a pawn to satisfy another’s life plan, even when the other person is a parent.214 The state’s responsibility to ensure young citizens develop autonomy does not mean that the state should undermine parents’ imprint on a child or encourage the child to choose every aspect of their life plan from scratch.

L. REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1341 does mean, however, that the state has the responsibility to ensure youth develop sufficient autonomy so that they can renegotiate their life plans insofar as they come to believe their parents’ identity, values, and plans do not suit them in fundamental respects.215 Put another way: liberal democracy properly gives parents the authority to raise children within parents’ religious traditions, brought up according to parents’ ethical principles, raised as members of their ethnic heritage, and even coaxed to support their sports teams. Yet children must also be given the tools to withdraw from such ways of life when they cannot embody these identities from the inside out. As moral philosopher Eamonn Callan succinctly put it, at a bare minimum, each child “must learn to ask the question of how we should live, and\t.\t.\t. how we answer it can be no servile echo of the answers others have given, even if our thoughts commonly turn out to be substantially the same as those that informed our parents’ lives.”216 Researchers who study identity have long recognized that adolescence is a critical period for identity formation, a time in which youth begin to self-consciously think about how they wish to define themselves in terms of social groups, and to separate in varying degrees from the identities assigned to them and associated with their parents.217 Furthermore, adolescence is a period in which a number will come to grapple with their own sexual orientation and gender identity.218 Access to information about LGBTQ identities and an accepting climate about these identities, research suggests, makes it easier for young people to assume them.219 An accepting climate also makes LGBTQ youth more likely to come out to parents and family members, and to live publicly as LGBTQ.220   215.

They do so by seeking to stifle access to and information about LGBTQ possibilities for young people’s identities, both making these identities harder for them to assume and increasing the possibility that youth who still come to adopt LGBTQ identities will see themselves in negative ways.221 Unfortunately, as with the doctrine of parens patriae to protect children’s well-being, U.S. legal doctrine incorporates no positive responsibility for the state to intercede on behalf of children’s autonomy.222 Because of this, the new era of parental rights laws remains insulated from legal challenge. C. The New Parental Rights and Government’s Responsibility To Educate Students for Citizenship Third and finally, government has the responsibility to ensure that children are prepared to competently assume the mantle of citizenship in a liberal democracy. Even as the Supreme Court first articulated respect for parents’ fundamental rights to raise their children, it recognized the state’s power “to regulate all schools, [and] that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship must be taught.”223 As the Supreme Court stated in Prince v. Massachusetts, “A democratic society rests, for its continuance, upon the healthy,   221. Pardo and Devor explain that [s]ome aspects of trans* and gender nonconforming identity development fit well within a classical identity development framework. Trans* and gender nonconforming people usually report that their earliest memories of recognizing gender occurred around the typical childhood ages. However, their ages differ in when they recognized that they do not fit in the gender and sex to which they were assigned. Adolescence and young adulthood for trans* and gender nonconforming people typically include age-appropriate periods of self-exploration, social exploration, and experimentation. However, puberty and the associated changes in social expectations are often times of extreme crisis for trans* and gender nonconforming youth due to unwanted physical maturation into adult bodies misaligned with their gender identities. This is a time of alarmingly high risk for suicide among trans* and gender nonconforming youth who lack sufficient familial supports. If they have not already articulated a trans* or gender nonconforming identity, many transgender people first do so during adolescence. Pardo & Devor, supra note 218, at 3.  222. Kay P.

This is despite (as well, perhaps, because of) the fact that preparing the young for this task has seldom been more important than today, when critical bulwarks of democracy are under sustained attack.227 Earlier, this Article argued that strong families that support children’s thriving do not just simply happen, but instead require the presence of particular conditions. The same is true for healthy democracies. It has become critically clear in the last decade in the United States that a vigorous liberal democracy cannot be sustained simply through formal elections and a basic framework of liberal democratic institutions. On the contrary, without a citizenry committed to upholding liberal democratic norms and principles of political and civil equality and the rule of law, the last few years have shown that our democracy is dangerously vulnerable to manipulation and abuse. Parental rights measures encroach on government’s legitimate ability to train its youth for citizenship, risking forward progress in several respects. For one thing, these new measures make it significantly more difficult to teach the racial lessons that U.S. children in particular need to become good citizens. Coming to understand the nation’s racial (and racist) history is critical to combat the high levels of bias that remain in our society, to evaluate critical policy issues that face the nation going forward, and to protect against threats to democracy that are deeply intertwined with racism.

Research shows that children as young as four make distinctions based on race; very young children also notice persistent distinctions in wealth based on race.229 Lacking other explanations, children’s biases cause them to believe that such distinctions are inherently the result of racial differences rather than the product of historical factors.230 Teaching children about historical discrimination reduces their racial biases by providing an alternative explanation of racial disparities.231 Unfortunately, studies show that although Black American parents discuss racism with their children (a conversation so significant that it has become known in popular parlance as “the Talk”), white American parents less often discuss the issue.232 This means that it is only in school that most white students will come to learn that racial disparities are not the product of intrinsic differences, if they learn this at all. While studies of the effects of teaching such history are limited, they suggest that teaching white children America’s racial history produces more positive and less negative attitudes toward Black Americans.233 By the same token, teaching young people about race and racism is necessary to ensure that they can fairly evaluate critical policy issues that face the nation going forward. Evidence shows that a number of significant public policy measures in the last decades have been driven by white Americans’ racial animus, an illegitimate motivation in a liberal democracy. These include the passage of welfare reform in 1996 and Republicans’ attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.234 Education could address this: Children exposed to   228. Parents Involved Cmty.

One potentially unfortunate consequence of teaching this history is that older white children (above age seven) report higher levels of racial guilt when they are exposed to such lessons.239 Should their feelings justify omitting lessons about the nation’s racist past?

There should be no doubt that, as between white children seeing Black children more negatively because they do not understand our country’s history of racism, and feeling guilty because they do, the latter choice is the just response. Furthermore, as researchers have noted, white children feeling guilty as a reaction to learning about racism may not be wholly negative, since such guilt has been shown in college students to motivate racial tolerance.241 What is more, as historian Stephanie Coontz cogently observed, while studying this history “may — indeed should — be disturbing,” if it is taught right, it does not have to be demoralizing: To tell the story of slavery is also to tell the story of those who championed a revolutionary alternative ideal — that all people are endowed with “inalienable” human rights. When we “whitewash” the past, we not only deny wrongs that still need to be righted, but we fail to honor the men and women — black, brown, and white — whose struggles for justice and equality prove beyond doubt that no group of Americans is “irredeemably sexist and racist.”242 The new parental rights measures also make it difficult for schools to teach a second lesson critical to students developing the commitment to political equality and respect for individual rights necessary to perpetuate a sound liberal democracy. That lesson involves coming to grips with what philosopher of education Eamonn Callan calls “the burdens of judgment,” after the political philosopher, John Rawls.243 By this, Callan means that youth must come to acknowledge the principle that reasonable people can and will disagree about fundamental issues surrounding the good life and religion, and that disagreements about such “comprehensive philosophies” cannot be resolved by any mutually accessible standards.244 It is through recognition of this fact that   240.

REV. 1305 (2023) 2023] FREE-MARKET FAMILY POLICY 1347 citizens in a polity come to endorse the view that the power of the state should not be used to foist their comprehensive views on others—an essential tenet for preserving a government that supports individual freedom and pluralism.245 Teaching the burdens of judgment is particularly important today, given rising threats to liberal democracy by those inside and outside of the United States who advocate “illiberal democracy” and “Christian nationalism.”246 Many of these new parental rights measures seek to ensure that children are not exposed to controversial views that conflict with those of their parents. Yet, as Callan shows, ensuring that children are exposed to deep differences in belief is critical to securing for future generations the liberty that parents who support parental rights measures seek to arrogate to themselves. Without the state’s ensuring that liberal democratic virtues are widely dispersed in the population, the state cannot guarantee that liberty will be protected in the future. An illiberal populace is more likely to support infringements on personal freedom. Its government would also need to exercise stricter controls on citizens who are less likely to respect basic liberal democratic principles. Accordingly, if respect for parents’ autonomy were allowed to preclude children from developing civic virtues, still more extensive infringements on citizens’ autonomy would result. Furthermore, it must be recognized that the risks to personal liberties from allowing parents to pass on illiberal views do not fall equally on all citizens; instead, they fall on citizens who are members of disfavored groups, and particularly the LGBTQ and racial minorities that these measures target. Citizens who have not come to accept basic liberal ideals, such as the “burdens of judgment,” are more likely to tyrannize marginalized groups and deny them political equality on the basis of their own comprehensive views.247 The significant opposition to same-sex marriage early in the twenty-first century (opposition that continues to exist, albeit among a smaller group of citizens) represented one flagrant example of illiberal citizens’ efforts to marginalize gays and lesbians based on their own comprehensive belief systems. The largest price for not teaching civic virtues of deference to the nation’s youth therefore will   245. Id. at 28; RAWLS, supra note 243, at 54.  246.

While dashing some of the hopes of parents who earnestly hold illiberal views should not be taken lightly, the rights of political minorities to the fundamental promise of liberal democracy cannot be sacrificed for these parents. Put another way, the fact that parents hold views contrary to liberal democratic ideals does not give the government ground simply to fold its tent and go home. As Stephen Macedo counsels, liberal democracy’s respect for pluralism requires that the state allow citizens to espouse illiberal views and to practice these views in their own lives.248 It does not, however, require that the state give such views a level playing field when it comes to the next generation.249 Instead, the state may and, indeed, must educate children for civic virtue precisely to preserve the freedom parents and others value so dearly for future generations. Respect for these parents’ liberty means that, to the extent possible, children should receive the necessary civic education in institutions outside the family, including public schools. But it does not mean that the state can forgo the responsibility to teach basic liberal democratic principles entirely. The crafting of legal doctrine that requires the state to fulfill this responsibility and allows challenge of parental rights laws that undercut the state’s duty is badly needed. CONCLUSION Two opposing models of what families need from the government to raise sound children have been voiced in the United States in recent years. The first, which argues that families need public economic supports, gained prominence during the first years of the pandemic, and was embodied in public policy during the pandemic’s economic fallout. The second, which contends that parents need protection from schools to raise sound children, is gaining momentum in red and purple states, and measures premised on this model are increasingly being enacted into state law. Which of these models gains ascendance will greatly influence the well-being and soundness of the next generation. On that score, the United States’ experience during the pandemic shows that government economic supports produce substantial gains for children’s well-being. The same cannot be said for parental rights measures, which are being spearheaded by conservative elites seeking to stymy passage of economic supports and backed by voters who feel socially and culturally threatened. These measures impose significant costs on children’s well-being,   248. See STEPHEN MACEDO, DIVERSITY AND DISTRUST: CIVIC EDUCATION IN A MULTICULTURAL DEMOCRACY 13–16 (2000).  249. Id.  101 N.C. L.

The parental rights model should be resisted both because these measures reduce the capacity to implement the government economic supports that demonstrably contribute to children’s well-being and because these parental rights policies themselves threaten marginalized children and teach the wrong lessons to other children.                                  101 N.C.
