There are currently six federal laws that protect students from dis-crimination.9 The first of such laws is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any pro-gram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”10 Second, in 1972, Congress passed Title IX of the Education Amendments, which states that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded    1.

If you are not convinced the federal government should pass such legislation to protect LGBTQ students, consider the following infor-mation: thirty-one states do not have laws that prohibit bullying on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity.15 Further, eight states cur-rently prohibit “the promotion of homosexuality”16 or restrict “discussions of homosexuality”17 in schools.18 Currently, at least three states have laws mandating the manner in which homosexuality may be discussed.19 For example, Alabama requires: [C]ourse materials and instruction that relate to sexual education or sexually transmitted diseases should include . . . that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense . . . .20  In Texas, “[T]he materials in education programs for persons younger than 18 years of age must . . . state that homosexual conduct is not an acceptable lifestyle and is a criminal offense . . . .” Finally, in Utah, “State law prohibits public schools from using materials . . . that include instruction in . . . the advocacy of homosexuality.”21 These states have maintained language in their statutes that homosexuality is illegal despite    11. 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (2017).  12. 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2017); 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (2017).  13. 42 U.S.C. § 6101 (2017).  14. 20 U.S.C. § 7905 (2017).  15.

Texas that deemed such laws uncon-stitutional.22  State actors, however, are not the only concern addressed by SNDA. By passing SNDA, Congress would prevent inconsistent treatment of LGBTQ students by future presidents who interpret existing laws differ-ently. On May 13, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Department of Education (DOE), under the Obama administration, issued a joint “Dear Colleague Letter” interpreting Title IX to protect students on the basis of their gender identity.23 The agencies concluded, “This means that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.”24 However, less than a year later (under the Trump administration), the DOJ and DOE withdrew the policy announced in the May 13, 2016 Dear Colleague Letter.25 In explaining their rationale for rescinding the previous policy announcement, the DOJ and DOE stated that the previous guidance did not “contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of Title IX . . . .”26 Put simply, with-out an express federal statute passed by Congress, the rights and protec-tions afforded to LGBTQ students are at the whim of differing presidential policy choices. Passage of the SNDA would eliminate a president’s ability to rescind rights protected by the statute.  State and federal policies that fail to protect LGBTQ students have a measurable negative impact on such students.27 In a study conducted in Massachusetts, “[Y]outh with a minority sexual orientation were signifi-cantly more likely than heterosexual youth to report perceived discrimina-tion (33.7% vs. 4.3%.).” Similarly, a larger percentage of transgendered youth reported discrimination than non-transgendered youth (31.3% vs. 3.7%). Importantly, another study found that “as the proportion of school districts that adopted anti-bullying policies increased, rates of past-year suicide attempts among lesbian and gay youths decreased.”28 Additionally, in counties with inclusive anti-bullying policies peer victimization is less likely.29     22.

Hatzenbuehler & Keyes, supra note 27, at S24.  29. Id.  2017] PROTECTING LGBTQ STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS 41  Part of the solution to the problems addressed above is the passage of SNDA. SNDA was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate on February 10, 2015.30 The bill, however, fell short of the votes needed to survive.31 The bill is yet to be reintroduced in the 115th Con-gress.32 The SNDA proposed in the 114th Congress (and supported by this article) states: No student shall, on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of such individual or of a person with whom the student associates or has associated, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.33 Compliance with the SNDA would be tied to funding (as it is with the other non-discriminatory laws previously discussed).34 In essence, if the law were to pass, the federal government could terminate or refuse to grant assistance to any recipient of federal funds that has been found to fail to comply with the law.35 This Article does not contend that passing the SNDA would solve all of the problems and challenges facing LGBTQ students across this nation. Nonetheless, LGBTQ students and parents of LGBTQ students should be provided protection by the federal government so that they can seek a rem-edy if their students are discriminated against on the basis of sexual orien-tation or gender identity. Some of our greatest legislative accomplishments occurred when we decided, as a nation, to protect all citizens, regardless of race (in 1964), regardless of gender (in 1972), regardless of disability (in 1973 and 1990), and regardless of age (1975). Let’s make 2018 the year that we, as a nation, decide to offer the same protection to LGBTQ students.  Joshua T. Mangiagli    30. HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN, supra note 6.  31. Id.
