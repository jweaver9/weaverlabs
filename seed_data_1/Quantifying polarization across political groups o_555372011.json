    "abstract": "There is growing concern that over the past decade, industrialized democratic\nnations are becoming increasingly politically polarized. Indeed, elections in\nthe US, UK, France, and Germany have all seen tightly won races, with notable\nexamples including the 2016 Trump vs. Clinton presidential election and the\nUK's Brexit referendum. However, while there has been much qualitative\ndiscussion of polarization on key issues, there are few examples of formal\nquantitative assessments examining this topic. Therefore, in this paper, we\nundertake a statistical evaluation of political polarization for\nrepresentatives elected to the US congress on key policy issues between\n2021-2022. The method is based on applying sentiment analysis to Twitter data\nand developing quantitative analysis for six political groupings defined based\non voting records. Two sets of policy groups are explored, including\ngeopolitical policies (e.g., Ukraine-Russia, China, Taiwan, etc.) and domestic\npolicies (e.g., abortion, climate change, LGBTQ, immigration, etc.). We find\nthat out of the twelve policies explored here, gun control was the most\npolitically polarizing, with significant polarization results found for all\ngroups (four of which were P < 0.001). The next most polarizing issues include\nimmigration and border control, fossil fuels, and Ukraine-Russia.\nInterestingly, the least polarized policy topics were Taiwan, LGBTQ, and the\nChinese Communist Party, potentially demonstrating the highest degree of\nbipartisanship on these issues. The results can be used to guide future policy\nmaking, by helping to identify areas of common ground across political groups.Comment: 31 pages, 7 figure",
