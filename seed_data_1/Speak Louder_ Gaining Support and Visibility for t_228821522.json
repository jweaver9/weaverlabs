MauriceUndergraduate Initiative Prize. 4.https://digitalcommons.wou.edu/maurice/4Nawwal Moustafa and Hillevi JohnsonSpeak Louder: .Gaining Support and Visibility for the GLBTQ CommunityMaurice Undergraduate Initiative Prize CompetitionFor the past five years, Western Oregon University's Werner University Center hashoused the Stonewall Center, a resource center for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, andqueer community members. The Stonewall Center is located in a small space beneath a set ofstairs that must be accessed through Abby's House, the University's center for women andfamilies and has almost no visibility to the general public. The Stonewall appears to be aconverted closet, and is only large enough for one small couch, one desk, and two bookshelves,space not adequate to accommodate or represent the GLBTQ population at Western OregonUniversity. The furnishings in the Stonewall Center are sparse, as well as low quality, and needto be replaced in order to provide a comfortable place to offer GLBTQ resources. There areservices and organizations on campus such as Safe Zone and the Triangle Alliance to offersupport to students, and Western continues to grow in embracing the GLBTQ population. Thesmall size and invisibility of the Stonewall Center does not adequatel y represent this growth.Despite this growth on campus, it can be seen as very difficult for GLBTQ students to becomfortable with their identity off the Western campus in the greater Monmouth-Independencearea.Our intentions in the Maurice Undergraduate Initiative Prize Competition were to gainmore visibility and adequate space for the GLBTQ community at Western, as well as toencourage members of the community who support the GLBTQcommunity to put a smallsymbol in their window of their car, home, dorm window, or other space. We planned ondocumenting the experience, including trials and errors, successes and failures. We also wantedto create a documentary in persuasion of our mission, hoping that a visual aspect may be moreappealing than just a petition. Also, since the Stonewall is in serious need of renovation, we hadhoped to raise funds for a better-equipped office. To raise funds, we were going to hand-design t-shirts to sell in order to benefit the Stonewall renovation. A student support petition was going tobe gathered in favor of moving the Stonewall Center, and we had plans of creating communityart projects to make a visible statement that represented the number of people who support alocation change and renovation.Our duo team was created through a collaboration of similar interests, correspondingmentalities, and complementary qualities. It included Nawwal Moustafa, a psychology major,and Hillevi Johnson, a Spanish major. We decided to develop this partnership aftercommunicating such a similar thought process and goal of wanting to create change and make adifference regarding this specific issue. Already knowing each other's capabilities, leadershipstrengths, and schedules, we were easily able to determine that working together would be fargreater of a success than any other option.After beginning the project, we quickly realized that it was much heftier than weimagined and took steps back to adjust our goals and start from the beginning, in order to trulycreate change. After researching an off-campus location in depth, communicating with City Halland Polk County, and speaking with Western administration, we learned. that the process formoving the center-whether off-campus or in a different location on-campus-will take severalyears and tens of thousands of dollars. We realized that if we wanted to be taken seriously, weneeded student support and to start at the very basic level. In order to do this, we decided that thebest way to engage campus would be inviting them to participate in something they'd never donebefore. We found a way to engage 246 people in creating a community art project in just threedays.In order to begin the student support and the Stonewall Center visibility process, wechose to create something not many people had taken part in, or even seen before. We decidedto begin constructing an art piece made of 20,000 differently-colored push pins on a 20 squarefoot piece of soundboard that spelled out the words \"Speak Louder.\" After scheduling the projectto occur over three days at a visible location in the university center, we completed the first tasksof arranging the materials and beginning the project so that future participants would have atemplate to work from. We used social networking, group rapping, and fliers to advertise ourefforts and cause. To make our event look more appealing, we created a Stonewall Centerinformation board, and we developed a survey to gain insight and statistics as to what campusgoers know about the existence, location, and importance of the center. Lastly, we distributedpurple rubber bracelets reading \"Support the Stonewall Center\" to increase visibility andparticipation.We centered our focus on on-campus change, but we also had high hopes and goals forcommunity change as well. Being located in a small, conservative, rural town, Western OregonUniversity students--especially those who identify as GLBTQ----can often find it difficult to bethemselves without concern once they step off of the campus boundaries. We decided that wewanted the GLBTQ visibility to spread to the greater Monmouth area, and our first step in doingthat would be to focus on outreach to businesses.By meeting with staff members and creating an outline, we established the beginnings ofa program that will allow businesses to send representatives to an \"ally training\" sponsored byWestern Oregon University. This ally training will teach business representatives how to beinclusive and supportive of GLBTQ students and community members. Upon conclusion of thetraining, the representative will earn a specific window cling that they can put in their businesswindow, showing the community and students that they completed the training and are workingto be supportive. We designed the cling for this project, began the ordering process to purchaseseveral hundred window clings, created a list of targeted Monmouth businesses, and begandeveloping the process to continue this project.In terms of meeting goals, we had a varying degree of success. Our initial goal had beento move the Stonewall Center into a more visible and accessible location, and we were unable todo so, as a result of how much more time and research that project will require. However, as wereevaluated our project, we set new goals in terms of raising visibility and student support oncampus. With our developing community art project, we set a goal of 200 participants, and farexceeded this by having 246 participants share our excitement in creating the push pin board. Byinforming over 100 people where the Stonewall Center is, we dramatically increased visibility.The art project was-by far-the most successful accomplishment of our project, as well as the172 surveys that were collected with it. We exceeded our expectations and were incrediblypleased with the results.Several original goals were manipulated as our efforts continued. We had originall ywanted to make and sell t-shirts, but we eventually decided that the bracelets would be easier togive out and far more cost-effective. Viewing this change as beneficial, we believe that is was avery successful way to spread the name of the Stonewall Center around campus. Ourdocumentary was created as our final analysis, but we hope to continue developing the short filmthat details the process of improving the Stonewall Center visibility. We did not yet distribute\"ally\" window clings to businesses, but that was because we determined that we did not want torush the process, and rather wanted to effectively build a program from the ground up. This willmake it more successful and create a better process to work from. This is another thing that wedo not look at negatively, but as something that will simply take more time, planning, anddedication for stronger results.Throughout our combined journey and team efforts, we encountered severaldisappointments and many successes. Luckily, several of our challenges simply led to differentmethods of executing our project and continuing to pursue our goals. We were initially upset thatwe were unable to move the Stonewall Center, but we have been so pleased with the result of theart project that it seemed as though it worked out the way that it needed to. That being said, it isstill a disappointment that the road to obtaining a new location for the center will be so difficultdue to financing, limited space, and the many factors and details that would go into a new center.Another perceived disappointment that in actuality served us positively was that we were unableto purchase the window clings. Our formatting was incorrect and we spent ample time workingwith an online company to alter it so that the final result would be clear, concise, and the correctimage. Despite this setback, it allowed us to reconsider our options and recognize the need for awell-pi armed, thought out project.However, there were two distinct disappointments that were not entirely resolved. Onewas a simple error of formatting on our survey. A question that we presented was a spectrum,asking participants to rank the importance of GLBTQ resources to self-identified students on ascale from 1-5, one being \"very important\" and five being \"unimportant.\" After noticing somecontradicting responses from a few participants, we realized that we had created a format thatwent against the usual spectrum format where the highest number on the spectrum would signifythe \"most\" of something, with one being the \"least\" of something. Several participants did notread the directions carefully and therefore answered with their previous knowledge of spectrumquestions, skewing the results a small amount. The last minor disappointment that weacknowledged was a small amount of apathy towards our art project from a few facultymembers. Several professors seemed reluctant to care that we were trying to make change for thebetter on this campus, and were reluctant to help. It was a little surprising to us, as it seems thatour professors are-or should be-the people who are urging us to be involved and be differentthan our predecessors. This small emotional setback was greatly overridden by theoverwhelming support by many others.Comparatively, our success felt abundant due to the amount of time, effort, and passionwe put into the project. In the beginning stages of this development, we had the success ofobtaining insight into the process of city zoning and the foreclosure process, as well as affiliatingourselves with the City of Monmouth and the Polk County Courthouse. We made connectionswith business representatives from these locations and informed them of our cause. For thecommunity of Monmouth, we completed our window cling design for businesses and began theprocess of formatting an \"ally training\" for businesses, which drastically moves the projectforward. We have far more to accomplish off-campus, but we feel successful in theaccomplishments that we made.On Western's campus, we were successful in expressing our concern to administration towork towards a solution together. This was gained through meeting with the Vice President ofStudent Affairs, the Director of the Werner University Center, and the Director of Abby's House.Our greatest successes sprung up from the development of the \"Speak Louder\" art board, as thestatistics and results were far more than were expected. We informed 34 people of what theStonewall Center is, and 47 of where it is located, solely based on survey responses alone. Ourcreation of a massive community art piece allowed 246 people to peacefully express theirconcern and voice their opinion together, and helped us gather 172 surveys and distribute about175 support bracelets in our effort to begin a support campaign. These numbers were rewardingto see, and analyzed as a huge success. Even the Provost and the Dean of Education participated!Through our surveys, we have been able to determine what students already know about thecenter, how often they use it, and what exactly they want it to provide for them-crucialinformation to advocating for students' needs.Our most treasured successes came from unexpected areas, and they made all of the time,effort, and hard work of the project completely worthwhile. While working on our \"SpeakLouder\" community art piece, we received an overwhelming abundance of compliments. Onestudent mentioned to us that it was \"the best event\" that she had participated in all year.Passersby would stop in their tracks, people took pictures, and we were commended repeatedly.Our success came from knowing that people cared about what we were doing for them, and thatstudents wanted to join in and participate. Finally, we were able to notice a certain atmosphere ofthe work environment for the art that we were so thoroughly pleased with. Students of alldifferent backgrounds, walks of life, campus involvements, and interests were sitting downtogether to collaboratively create this piece. They were striking up conversation as their handsbusily moved from push-pin container to board, and it seemed as though previouscommunication and social barriers were broken. The few yards of space that the \"Speak Louder\"project occupied seemed to be a microcosm of immense inclusion, support, and passion formoving forward. It felt as though the creation of this project was a simulation of what we hopeto obtain for our entire university. Following the conclusion of our project, we are content withthe results of what we have accomplished, as our success were felt to be numerous, and oursetbacks were all positive learning experiences.Throughout the entirety of this project, Nawwal Moustafa distinguished herself as theartistic coordinator and the creative mind. She did a large majority of design work- both graphicdesign, film creation and free-hand art design, as well as developed the idea for our communityart piece. She stood out as a communication specialist as well, making phone calls for researchpurposes and informing people of our endeavors.Specifically, Nawwal also calculated the number of push pins to purchase for our artproject, created a Facebook event and graphic design for the event photo in order to advertise,designed a tabling pamphlet, did all the calls and research to learn about the home foreclosureprocess, and outlined the letters for the words \"Speak Louder\" free-hand for the art.In a complementary fashion, Hillevi Johnson worked as the organizer and planner for allof the different facets of this project. She worked to schedule meetings, reserve spaces for the artevent, interpreted survey data collections, and make purchases of necessary materials.More explicitly, Hillevi created and purchased support bracelets, purchased all materialsfor the art project, and chose the words and colors for the art. She organized meetings and metwith Jon Tucker, the director of the Werner University Center, and well as Mary Ellen DelioStritto, the director of Abby's House, to discuss the location and future of the Stonewall Center.Also, Hillevi acted as a photographer of the process, organized volunteers to assist in the tablingof the art project, created a Stonewall Center information display board, and created the idea toestablish an \"ally training\" for businesses in the Monmouth area.Collaboratively, we completed many tasks together. We searched for locations off-campus that could be potential future spaces for the center, visited Polk County Courthouse toseek information about a particular house on Knox Street, and visited City Hall to speak with thecity planner about zoning information. We spoke to administration at the university together, andboth had a meeting with the Vice President of Student Affairs to discuss our project and to seekinformation and advice. Regarding the community art project, we co-designed the board,shopped for materials, outlined the border and letters with push pins, created a survey, and tabledfor three consecutive days (27 total hours) in the Werner University Center to manage the artproject.Even if working on separate tasks, we always communicated the process to each otherand were in the sarne physical location. By doing so, we learned the sarne things by theconclusion of the project. Initially, we came to the realization that in order to create real change,it's essential to begin with the fundamentals---creating the foundation to a campaign or amovement is the first necessary step. If it is skipped, the process will later crumble. By takingsteps backward in our own project, we were able to later move forward with great success.In regards to moving the Stonewall Center and learning about foreclosures and cityhousing management, we learned that information can be difficult to come across and thatsometimes it's necessary to step back and do a lot of research and support building first beforepushing an effort further. We were both informed that within the Werner University Center, nospace exists in which to move the center, and so many groups are vying for space within thebuilding that it would be improbable to find space. Also, we acquired information regardingbudget, and that the university has no extra money to put towards large-scale changes such aspurchasing an off-campus building. From the city pi anner, Mark Fancy, we were taught howeach zone of the city works, how it is possible to change a zone to manipulate it to yourindividual needs, and what each type of zone may be used for.In the preparations, creation, and completion of our community art project, we learnedhow to design a large-scale piece that would be put together collaboratively, as well as how toattract many people to participate. We also noticed that people thoroughly enjoy tasks thatinvolve hand motion, but little thought-it kept many people participating for hours in ourproject. Volunteers need to be reminded of the hours they signed up to help, people love freebracelets, repeatedly pushing in thousands of tacks will give you knuckle blisters, and it isimperative to let go of the need to perfect things when several hundred people are helping tocreate it-styles will be different and that is a part of the beauty.After analyzing the data from the completed surveys, we learned that the majority ofpeople said that having resources for the GLBTQ community is \"very important,\" that the mostfavored location for the Stonewall Center is in the Werner University Center with more space,and that almost half of the survey participants did not know either that the center exists or whereit is located (along with other statistics and information).Lastly, we learned two important concepts as a result of our project. When trying toappeal to the masses in an effort to increase participation, with regards to GLBTQ events oractivities, it seems incredibly beneficial to do something that is more applicable to everyone. Itgains more interest, and when people are captivated is when they are most likely to learnsomething or be open to something new. Also, we came to the conclusion that anything ispossible. It seems cliche, but we literally decided we wanted to make words on a board with20,000 push pins and call it art, and it worked. We made it into a vibrant piece of campus art. Welearned that if we want to make something happen, all that needs to occur is the first step. Therest falls into place with dedication and effort.When thinking of future endeavors in similar 'areas, we have several recommendations.The first is to start a project such as this from the beginning, with the very basic steps- they setthe foundation and are truly the most critical. Building up a following of supporters, empoweringcoalitions, and increasing involvement before trying to make large changes is a way tostrengthen the entire endeavor. Determining a time frame quickly and creating a backwards planis essential to meet goal benchmarks. Due to the nature of the project revolving around the queercommunity, we had learned that many people don't naturally approach events that they feel asthough do not relate to them. By intriguing people with something relatable, they are moreinclined to ask why you're doing it. From there you can teach, inform, and capture attention.Also, it was beneficial to be creative and to bring art into the process; people love to feelincluded and involved, and thus will be far more likely to be willing to hear what you have to sayabout your campaign or cause. Creating human connections and artistic connections are whatmoved this project forward at such a pace.Our small team doesn't plan on stopping this project; the end is simply the beginning. Wehave goals to complete thorough research on all Oregon University System universities' resourcecenters, showcase the art project in the Werner University Center, and network to build connectsand support for the Stonewall Center. We are going to purchase the \"Ally\" clings for Monmouthbusinesses, and organize a business ally training for representatives of the businesses so that wecan further the development of this community support project. Finally, we will continuepushing for a new space for the Stonewall Center by meeting with administration about space,receiving more surveys, and building more student support.Survey Results\"SPEAK LOUDER\" RESULTSTotal Project Participants: 246Including:117Students19 Faculty/Staff Members3 OHSU Students3 Children1Missionary3 UnidentifiedSurveys Received: 172Self-identified sexual orientations of survey participantsincluded:114 Heterosexual/Straight41 GLBTQ (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer)Self-identifications:1 asexual1 questioning3 pansexual1 gay (female)11gay (male)10lesbian6 bisexual8 queer17 Chose not to respondSurvey Totals (Including all 172 surveys):Q kn .

    "abstract": "For the past five years, Western Oregon University\\u27s Werner University Center has housed the Stonewall Center, a resource center for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer community members. Our intentions in the Maurice Undergraduate Initiative Prize Competition were to gain more visibility and adequate space for the GLBTQ community at Western, as well as to encourage members of the community who support the GLBTQ community to put a small symbol in their window of their car, home, dorm window, or other space. We recorded this experience through a documentary, fundraising, and a student support petition.https://digitalcommons.wou.edu/maurice/1004/thumbnail.jp",
