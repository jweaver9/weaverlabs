The aim of thisstudy is to identify perceptions of inclusive culture, policies, values, and practices in one specificinclusive choir in Spain. The sample consisted of 135 members, ranging from 18 to 79 years of age, ofwhich 22.2% have recognised disabilities. All of them filled in the adapted Scale for the Assessmentof Inclusion (SAI) form. The results show that, regardless of gender, age, and length of participationin the choir, their members share positive perceptions of the inclusiveness of its values, policies,practices, and culture. However, perceptions vary across the groups surveyed, and are generallymore favourable among participants with a disability, those without a university education, or thoseaged 26 or over. It is found that people who participate in an inclusive choir, in which music is themediating resource, perceive a high level of inclusion that allows them to feel they belong to a groupwhere diversity, equality, and the promotion of people are respected. The findings are analysed,considering the importance of conducting multidimensional evaluations that include all members ofan organisation.Keywords: choral singing; social inclusion; socio-musical; inclusive education; disability; diversity;Cantatutti; social transformation; inclusivity; Index for Inclusion1. IntroductionThe term inclusion refers to the full integration of all members of a society or com-munity, regardless of their personal characteristics or circumstances. The term initiallyemerged in the field of education to describe the integration of students with disabilitiesinto mainstream schools [1]. It has evolved from the concept of “integration” [2], and hasbeen extended to different areas, such as labour, cultural, and social inclusion.Inclusion is based on the principle that all individuals have the right to receive aquality education, and to participate actively in society, regardless of their disability orother characteristics. It aims to promote the participation and recognition of all groups onequal terms, eliminating all forms of discrimination.In the context of the European Union, the term “social inclusion” emerged in the firstdecade of the 21st century, addressing the need to eradicate poverty and social exclusion [3].Although the exact definition of social inclusion as the antithesis of social exclusion hasbeen debated [4], the concept has been broadened, to encompass diverse dimensions suchas race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, age, and religion.Inclusion can manifest itself at different levels, including access to services and re-sources, participation in activities, and representation in governance and decision-makingbodies [5]. It aims to ensure equal opportunities and the full exercising of rights for allpeople, contributing to the building of fairer and more equitable societies [6].Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758. https://doi.org/10.3390/bs13090758 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/behavsciBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 2 of 23According to [7], equity plays a fundamental role in reducing inequalities in keyoutcomes, such as life expectancy, access to education, health, and political freedoms. It isseen as a crucial factor in achieving equality of opportunity for all individuals, especiallythose belonging to disadvantaged and poor groups.In accordance with [8], over the last thirty years, international initiatives have beencarried out to promote inclusive education, which has become a global phenomenon ofgreat interest to the academic community, and to society in general. Inclusive educationis understood as a global challenge that involves various actors, such as governments,schools, teachers, students, families, and society in general. It is a complex and multifacetedphenomenon that needs to be approached and understood in a holistic and comprehensiveway. It is not limited only to the inclusion of students with disabilities, but also encompassesthe inclusion of students from different ethnic, cultural, linguistic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds.International initiatives in inclusive education date back to the 1990 UN World Con-ference on Education for All [9], and the 1994 World Conference on Special Needs Edu-cation [1], which promoted the idea of an educational environment for all children. Theterm “inclusive education” first appeared in 2000 in the Dakar Framework for Action docu-ment [10]. Since then, instruments such as the Index for Inclusion have been developed, tosupport work towards inclusive education in schools.Inclusive education has evolved over time, broadening its focus beyond studentswith disabilities, to include all students. Educational inclusion is recognised as a principlebased on equality, justice, and equity, and its effective implementation can be influenced bypolitical, social, economic, and cultural factors [11].The UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, approved in the Spanish Congressof Deputies on 12 December 2017 [12], has set targets to ensure inclusive and equitablequality education. It highlights the importance of listening to the voices and testimoniesof learners in the development of inclusive education, as well as the need to collect datato assess progress towards inclusion [13]. The implementation of inclusive education ischallenging but is seen as fundamental to achieving inclusive and democratic societies.In 2000, Ref. [14] introduced the first version of the Index for Inclusion, an assessmentand development tool designed to support educational institutions, including schools andother centres, in their work towards the achievement of inclusive education. The resourcewas developed by the Centre for Studies on Inclusive Education (CSIE) in the UK, andhas been used in over 30 countries. The Index for Inclusion is based on the premise thatinclusion is not just a goal in itself, but a means to improve the quality of education forall learners. Its approach provides educational institutions with a framework that enablesthem to reflect on their practice, and to identify and overcome barriers to participationand progress for all students. Encompassing more than 100 indicators divided across fourdimensions—context, policy and practice, participation and learning, and outcomes—theIndex for Inclusion serves as a holistic and exhaustive tool.The Index for Inclusion has proven to be a valuable resource in education, facilitatingthe creation of inclusive environments in schools. However, according to [15], its applicationto organisations providing services to people with disabilities has been limited. Theauthors have, therefore, developed the Scale for the Assessment of Inclusion (SAI), basedon this tool.These authors state that their adaptation of the Index for Inclusion has been constructedtaking into account the specific needs of people with disabilities, and the particularitiesof the organisations that serve them. To this end, modifications and adjustments havebeen made, to adequately address the dimensions of inclusion that are relevant to thiscontext. The authors have developed a scale with strong psychometric properties. Thisscale evidences the appropriateness of the adaptation made, as well as the relevance ofthe changes introduced. The validity and reliability of the scale were rigorously assessed,ensuring its usefulness and applicability in the context of organisations providing servicesto people with disabilities.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 3 of 23This comprehensive instrument (SAI) has been used in this study as a methodolog-ical backbone, as it provides a solid framework for the study of the self-perception ofinclusiveness in the context of inclusive educational practice.Consequently, this article disseminates the outcomes derived from the implementationof a questionnaire adapted from the Scale for the Assessment of Inclusion (SAI) in anon-formal inclusive music practice through choral singing, conducted at the Faculty ofEducation of the University of Zaragoza, Spain [16]. The main objective of the study wasto find out and detect the perception of inclusion of people, with and without functionaldiversity, who participate in the Cantatutti Inclusive Choir. This research endeavor seeks toaddress a notable gap in the literature, as there is a dearth of comprehensive studies delvinginto this specific topic within the socio-musical realm. While certain projects are labeled asinclusive, a significant void exists concerning the quantification and measurement of suchinclusiveness. Additionally, the linkage of these projects with a recognised framework,such as the Index for Inclusion, remains largely unexplored in the existing literature.The Inclusive Choir Cantatutti is a musical ensemble established in Zaragoza, activesince 2017, whose purpose is to foster the inclusion and active participation of individualswho are diverse in terms of ability, (dis)ability, origin, socio-economic status, culture, age,or education level. Its main objective is to provide an inclusive musical experience, wherediverse people have the opportunity to sing together, and share their appreciation formusic. Through this initiative, the choir seeks to challenge existing barriers and stereotypes,by creating an environment in which all participants feel recognised and respected inequal measure.This choir is characterised by its multimodal expression, in which voice, body lan-guage, and Spanish Sign Language (LSE) are integrated, allowing the participation ofpeople with and without functional diversity [17]. Choral practice, in this context, favourspersonal and collective development, by promoting self-esteem, the construction of identitywithin the group, friendship, and the generation of new social relationships. Participationin this choir entails the acquisition of interpersonal interaction skills, which implies asignificant sense of social responsibility [18].The participation in a project such as an inclusive choir addresses four of the SDGs ofthe 2030 Agenda, as it ensures and fosters the wellbeing of its members (SDG 3), promotesinclusive, equitable, and quality education and learning opportunities for all (SDG 4),contributes to a reduction in social inequalities (SDG 5), and fosters collaboration to build apeaceful and inclusive society (SDG 16).Music is an art that has been used since ancient times as a means of expression andcommunication, and can be a tool to promote social inclusion and community cohesion.According to [19], the performing arts have the potential to foster active participation, socialinclusion, and empowerment.Neurological, cognitive, and social psychological research suggests that participationin musical activities can have a significant impact on social inclusion, understood as asubjective sense of belonging, and integration within a social group [20].According to [21], music, as an artistic expression, has the potential to promote socialinclusion in a community, through overcoming barriers that separate people, and thuscontributing to the construction of inclusive, supportive, and discrimination-free societies.Socio-musical projects can be a valuable tool for fostering social inclusion, as they allowpeople of different backgrounds, ages, and musical abilities to participate in collectivemusical activities, creating inclusive and safe spaces for learning and participation. Inaddition, music can be used as a means to raise awareness, and sensitise society to inclusionand diversity issues.Inclusive educational practice must recognise human musicality as essential to welbe-ing, and promote an enriched and broader curriculum that allows everyone the opportunityto be musical [22].Inclusion in the artistic context can be approached in two different ways: guaran-teeingequal access to artistic training and opportunities, removing barriers, and allowing the fullBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 4 of 23participation of all people, regardless of their personal characteristics or profiles [23,24];and focusing on the representation of participants, which seeks to ensure that diverseperspectives and voices are reflected in artistic production, and in the cultural spherein general.Defining and measuring inclusion is a challenging but crucial task, as its meaningvaries in different contexts. According to [25], inclusive musical experiences encompassintellectual, social, and affective processes that can bring about positive change in oursociety. These experiences depend on positive interactions with other individuals, asargued by [26].Ref. [27] states that art plays a fundamental role in social reconstruction, as it facilitatesindividual and community integration. Moreover, artistic practice has a direct influence onincreasing people’s confidence and motivation. Ref. [28] stresses that socio-educational andcommunity projects based on music as a mediation tool can contribute to mitigating socialdysfunctions, promoting cohesion, as well as a sense of belonging and community identity.Recent studies have investigated the benefits of participating in socio-musical projectsas a means of social inclusion and transformation [18,29,30]. These practices, which havebeen developed since the late 20th century, examine the positive impact that musical experi-ences and practices have on inclusion. Furthermore, the psychological and social benefits ofchoral singing in socio-musical projects have been evidenced for both participants and audi-ences alike [31–34]. These studies support the psychological and social benefits of music ingeneral, and choral singing in particular, as well as their ability to promote social inclusion.According to [35], the analysis of the degree of inclusion in centres and services thatcare for people with diverse educational needs is a relevant aspect to consider. Althoughthere are numerous studies focusing on inclusive practices in compulsory education, theresearch on these practices in non-formal or adult education is limited. Consequently, thisstudy aims to assess the level of inclusion in a choral grouping characterised by its inclusiveapproach, which seeks the participation of individuals from diverse backgrounds. The aimis to analyse the possible impact of different variables on the perception of inclusion insuch a context. The study also tries to find out whether, as a group, its members perceivethat they are part of an inclusive community, with inclusive values, policies, and practices.The aim is also to investigate whether personal variables, such as sex, gender, age, havingor not having a disability, special educational needs, and/or health problems, influenceperceptions of inclusion. It also aims to analyse the influence of variables more closelylinked to the choir, such as seniority, sense of permanence in the institution, or the roleplayed in it.The hypotheses formulated in this study are as follows:Hypothesis 1 (H1). If the analyzed project genuinely promotes inclusion, it will achieve highscores in all four dimensions of inclusion: community, values, policies, and practices.Hypothesis 2 (H2). No significant differences in inclusion scores will be found based on sex,gender, age, tenure, or role played in the project.Hypothesis 3 (H3). Significant differences in inclusion scores will be found based on groups withand without disabilities.Hypothesis 4 (H4). Significant differences will also be found based on special educational needsand physical or mental health problems.These hypotheses will serve as a theoretical framework for the analysis of the collecteddata, and will contribute to expanding our understanding of the perception of inclusion innon-formal or adult education contexts.2. Materials and MethodsAn ex post facto study of an exploratory and correlational nature has been conducted toanalyse the relationships between the variables of interest derived from the population thatBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 5 of 23has received the questionnaire used. Attending to [36], this design entails the analysis of pre-existing data, rather than the manipulation of variables, rendering direct causal conclusionsimpractical. While associations and patterns can be identified within the data, carefulconsideration is required when interpreting them as causal relationships. Notwithstandingits limitations, this design proves advantageous for exploring relationships in contextswhere controlled experiments are infeasible. This approach provides a basis for futureresearch, and may help to generate new hypotheses, and help us to better understand thephenomena studied around inclusive activities in a context with socially heterogeneousparticipants, with and without functional diversity.2.1. Context and Sample of ParticipantsThe study sample consisted of 135 active participants who are part of an inclusivechoir based at the university of Zaragoza, with a track record of 6 years. This choiradopts an approach in which choral practice is seen as a means of personal development,transformation, and social inclusion. The composition of the choir is diverse, includingpeople with and without functional diversity, and people of different ethnicities andnationalities. In addition, the choir includes the entire university educational community,as well as citizens with no previous or current relationship with the university.All participants were invited to take part in the study during their regular choirrehearsal sessions. The invitation was extended to all active choir members, allowingthem the opportunity to participate voluntarily. This approach ensured that a diverse andrepresentative sample of choir members had the chance to contribute their insights andperspectives to the study (see Table 1).Table 1. Technical data sheet of the sample.Technical SpecificationsScope City of ZaragozaGroup Cantatutti Inclusive ChoirTotal choir members 153 choristersSample assessed 135 choristersMethod Google Forms sent via WhatsAppDate April 2023Of the total of 153 choralists, 135 voluntary responses were obtained, and these canbe considered as representative of the community as a whole (representing 88.2% of thetotal). The different profiles of participants include organisers (3), collaborators (5), anddirect users (127). Of the sample, 65.2%, i.e., 88 people, are women; compared to 45 men;and 2 genderfluid people.Of the participants, 62.2%, i.e., 84 people, are aged between 18 and 25; 15.6% arebetween 26 and 36 years old; 5.2% are between 37 and 50 years old; and 17% are over51 years old. In terms of permanence, 41 people, i.e., 30.4%, had been involved in theproject for less than 6 months, 8.9% between 6 months and 1 year, 20% between 1 and2 years, 8.1% between 2 and 3 years, 8.9% between 3 and 4 years, 10.4% between 4 and5 years, and 13.3% between 5 and 6 years.Of the participants, 85.2% were from Spain, but there were also participants fromArgentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, France, Ghana, India, Italy,Peru, Romania, Republic of Korea, and the United States. Regarding religion, 25.9% of theparticipants declared themselves agnostic, 27.4% atheist, and 32.6% Catholic Christians,and the remaining 14.1% declared themselves as belonging to other branches of Christianity,preferred not to say, or other. In terms of academic level, 7 participants have a doctorate, 7have a master’s degree, 5 have a postgraduate degree, 33 have a university degree, 9 havea bachelor’s degree, 6 have a diploma, 17 have a professional qualification, 25 are currentlystudying at the university, 19 have a baccalaureate, 5 finished secondary education, and 2finished primary education.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 6 of 23Of the participants, 22.2% have a recognised disability, including 9 people with avisual disability, 4 with a hearing disability, 6 with a motor disability, 4 with an intellectualdisability, and 1 with a visceral disability. Of the participants, 9% were people with specificeducational support needs, including 3 people with autism spectrum disorder or Asperger’ssyndrome, and 8 people with ADHD. Of the 23% of participants who reported physical ormental health problems, 9 were people with anxiety disorder, 5 with depression, 3 withobsessive compulsive disorder, 3 with stage fright, and 1 with panic disorder.2.2. InstrumentThe instrument used to collect data in this study was a questionnaire adapted from theEvaluation of Inclusion Scale (SAI) [15]. This scale consists of 24 items grouped into fourfactors, developed from the Index for Inclusion, specifically designed for use in centres forpeople with disabilities that offer non-formal education. Each item in the scale is assessedon a 4-point Likert-type scale, where higher scores indicate more inclusive outcomes. Thisinstrument is one of the few available to assess inclusion in this type of organisation. It hasbeen selected in order to measure the level of social inclusion in the choir, even though it isnot an organisation as such. It is easy to fill out, is designed for the same purpose as thiswork, and there is evidence of its validity and reliability.In the study by [15], they provide evidence of the reliability and validity of theinstrument, with internal consistency values above 0.96, and a validity analysis of itsinternal structure, through an exploratory factor analysis. In this analysis, the authorsfound four factors (see Table 2): community, composed of 6 items that assess the feelingof belonging to a group to which all members contribute, and where they are important;values, composed of 5 items that assess the existence of values focused on the personand their potential, as each person is unique; policies, made up of 6 items that assess theexistence of policies and strategies that promote the defence of the rights of all people,diversity, and equality, as well as the promotion of people as unique individuals; andpractices, made up of 7 items that assess actions based on the principle that each personhas the right to have a personal project, to achieve their aspirations and goals, and to makedecisions about their future.Table 2. Changes made to the SAI for the final version of the scale (number of questions).Factors SAI [15] Adapted FinalPractices 7 5Community 6 6Policies 6 5Values 5 5The questionnaire used in this study was an adapted version, in which three of theitems were removed from the original version (see Table 2), due to their irrelevance inthe context of this study. Specifically, items 3, 17, and 21 were removed, as they were notrelevant to the study. All items were to be answered via 4-level Likert-type response options(Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, and Strongly Agree), identical to the original version.In addition to the adapted version of the SAI, 10 questions related to the socio-demographicassessment of the participants were included. The comprehensive questionnaire can befound in Appendix A.The adaptation of the questionnaire, as implemented in this study, was undertakento ensure its alignment with the specific research context and objectives. Within thisframework, the decision to modify the questionnaire was guided by a careful considerationof its relevance to the study’s scope. It is essential to highlight that the Likert-type responseformat was maintained to ensure consistency with the original version, and facilitatecomparative analysis.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 7 of 232.3. ProcedureThe procedure included three sessions with the research participants. In the firstsession, the study and its objectives were presented and explained, and the participantswere asked for their informed consent [37]. In the second session, the instrument wasapplied, starting with the professionals in charge, followed by the collaborators and theparticipants. Finally, in the third session, the results were returned, in compliance withthe ethical duty of social research to inform and involve the informants implicated in theprocess [38].The sessions were conducted as a voluntary collective activity, with the entire groupparticipating together in a shared classroom setting, adhering to the choir’s customaryrehearsal schedule. Each participant was provided with a personal and individual de-vice, allowing for privacy and tailored adaptation, where necessary. The timing of thequestionnaire administration was deliberately positioned prior to engaging in the singingactivities, affording participants adequate opportunity for contemplation and deliberateresponse. To facilitate the proceedings, the presence of three researchers ensured guidanceand assistance throughout the sessions.Each session lasted approximately one hour. The instrument was presented, andinstructions for its completion were provided. During the sessions, it was necessary toread each indicator, and provide additional explanations based on the statements in thequestionnaire. Support staff was available to provide physical assistance if necessary, aswell as additional help to ensure understanding of the items and possible responses, takinginto account the diversity of the group.To ensure data confidentiality, several measures were implemented. The responsescollected through Google Forms were stored on a password-protected and secure onlineplatform. Access to the collected data was restricted to the research team members only.Additionally, all data were anonymised during the analysis phase, using unique identifiersinstead of participants’ personal information.During Session 1 of the study, participants were provided with a detailed explanationof the research objectives, procedures, and potential risks. They were then given theopportunity to ask questions and seek clarifications. Participants who agreed to take partin the study were asked to provide their informed consent by signing a consent form. Thisform outlined their rights as participants, and indicated their voluntary participation. Thesigned consent forms were securely stored, and kept separate from the collected data, tofurther ensure confidentiality.2.4. Data AnalysisAlthough the SAI scale is initially supported by content validity [15], which, in turn,is supported by the literature review on inclusion and its components, as well as expertconsultation and content analysis of each of its items, it is relevant to analyse the validityand reliability of the scale adapted for this study, given the modifications made to adaptit to the research context. With regard to the reliability of the scale used, the data wereanalysed using Jamovi software version 2.4.1. [39]. The acceptability of reliability wasdetermined using the guideline provided by [40], where values exceeding 0.65 are consid-ered acceptable under research circumstances. To assess the internal consistency of thescale, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and McDonald’s omega coefficient were calculated. Anassessment of construct validity was also carried out by means of an exploratory factoranalysis, specifically using the principal component analysis method with Varimax rotationand Kaiser standardisation (following the same procedure used by the original authors ofthe instrument). This data analysis provides the basis from which to consider the factors orsubscales of the SAI Scale as variables in subsequent analyses.Given the size of the sample used in this study, it was decided to recode the variables ofinterest. It was observed that the detailed information collected generated categories with areduced representation of participants. Considering this situation, it was decided to recodeBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 8 of 23the variables into dichotomous categories. This facilitated the analysis and interpretationof the results, improving the representativeness of the groups in the study.In order to respond to the main objective of this article, and to analyse the perceivedlevel of inclusion in the music group and the factors associated with it, statistical analyseswere carried out using both descriptive and inferential bivariate statistics (ANOVA) andStudent’s t-tests, to test the hypotheses proposed, as well as the Jamovi version 2.4.1.programme [39]. To test the proposed hypotheses concerning the role of various variables(i.e., sex, gender, age, tenure, role played, etc.) in the level of inclusion and its factors,ANOVAs were employed for comparisons involving variables with more than two groups.Additionally, after the recoding of these variables into dichotomous categories, t-tests wereapplied. A significance level of 0.05 was adopted for these analyses.2.5. Ethical StatementIn accordance with the ethical policies of the journal, the utmost responsibility andrespect were maintained for the participants during the research, ensuring adherence to thestrictest ethical standards. Prior to their participation in the study, informed consent wasobtained from all subjects. Throughout the investigation, the confidentiality and anonymityof the participants were guaranteed, in alignment with the ethical principles of respect,beneficence, non-maleficence, return of results, and justice. Additionally, all the protocolssuggested by the academic literature and the Declaration of Helsinki in relation to researchwith human subjects were rigorously followed [37].Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Cantatutti Inclusive Choir, where the researchwas carried out, operates under the supervision of the Music and Inclusion for SocialChange Chair, which was established through an agreement between the University ofZaragoza and the Institute of Social Services of the Government of Aragon. This collabora-tion emphasises a commitment to integrity and ethics in research, especially in initiativesthat promote social inclusion through music, and focus on the wellbeing and inclusion ofvulnerable and disadvantaged individuals.Given that the University of Zaragoza does not have a specific ethics committee,special care was taken to ensure compliance with the ethical guidelines set forth by theMusic and Inclusion for Social Change Chair, which includes ethical research as one of itskey objectives and purposes.3. Results3.1. Evidence of Reliability and Validity of the Adapted SAI ScaleFirstly, the reliability of the scale and the quality of its items were analysed usingCronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega. All items obtained values above 0.300 in theitem–total correlation [41], and the scale as a whole has optimal reliability values (Table 3).Table 3. Scale reliability statistics.Cronbach’s α McDonald’sω0.899 0.902Secondly, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted, using the principal com-ponents method, with Varimax rotation and Kaiser standardisation, to assess constructvalidity, following a procedure identical to that used by the original authors of the SAI [15].The results were arranged according to four factors (Table 4), as in the SAI, in order toachieve the greatest similarity with that scale, being able to explain 53.6% of the variance.Behav.

It emphasises belief in the uniquepotential of each individual, and the importance of having confidence in their abilities.Four of the five items that were originally part of this factor are retained. One of them (itemVII) previously belonged to Values, and now becomes part of the Policies factor, and itemX, originally belonging to Policies in the SAI, is now part of the Values factor. The subscaleobtained a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.752.Factor 2, called “Practices”, consists of five items that refer to actions based on theprinciple that each person has the right to have personal goals and aspirations, as well asto make decisions about their future. Item XVII is retained in this factor (despite having asimilar factor loading also in another factor) for consistency with the initial SAI scale. Thesubscale obtained a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.768.Factor 3, called “Policies”, is composed of six items that refer to the existence of policiesand strategies that promote the defence of rights, diversity, equality, and the promotionBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 10 of 23of people as unique individuals. Items II and III are maintained in this factor (althoughthey show similar factor loadings in another factor), for consistency with the SAI. However,items VII and XII, previously belonging to Values and Community, are incorporated into“Policies”, as their factor loadings are much higher in this one, with respect to those obtainedin other factors. The subscale obtained a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.776.Factor 4, called “Community”, consists of five items that refer to aspects related tobelonging to a team in which all members are valued and play a relevant role in the properdevelopment of practices. The importance of creating inclusive processes where everyonefeels part of the team is highlighted. Item XIX is retained in this factor (despite also havinga similar factor loading in another one) for consistency with the SAI. The subscale obtaineda Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.732.In conclusion, the instrument, with its final configuration of 21 items (Table 6), hasdemonstrated evidence of reliability and validity, both overall, and on the different subscales.Table 6.

It should be noted that the responseson this scale range from 1 to 4, with “Strongly Agree” being assigned a 1, and “StronglyDisagree” being assigned a 4. In this study, direct scores were calculated for the differentfactors assessed via the questionnaire used. Once these scores were obtained, typificationwas carried out via converting them into z-scores. This typing process made it possible tostandardise the scores in relation to the mean and standard deviation of the sample, thusfacilitating the comparison and contrasting of the results between the different factors andgroups of interest. As can be seen in Table 7, the typed means indicate a higher perceptionof inclusion in the factor corresponding to “Values”, followed by “Community”, “Policies”,and “Practices”. The values are, in any case, very close to each other.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 11 of 23Table 7.

Relationships between the Variables of InterestIn the present study, data analysis was carried out in order to examine the relationshipsbetween the responses to the scale used in this research (and the factors assessed via thescale) and the variables of interest: “profile”, “length of participation”, “age”, “sex”, “gen-der”, “religion”, “country”, “academic degree”, “disability”, “special needs”, and “physicaland mental health problems”. (The category “disability” encompasses conditions thatresult in impairments affecting various aspects of daily life functioning. The term “specialneeds” denotes requirements essential for individuals facing specific challenges, whichmay not necessarily align with a formally recognised disability category. “Physical andmental health problems” encompass conditions impacting a person’s physical wellbeing ormental health, which may not always directly correspond to a formally diagnosed disability.These distinctions were established based on participants’ self-reported information, andany available medical documentation).In a preliminary analysis, the results revealed that most of the variables of interest (i.e.,“profile”, “length of association”, “age”, “sex”, “gender”, “religion”, “country”, “academicdegree”, “special needs”, and “physical and mental health problems”) did not show signifi-cant differences with the responses to the inclusion questionnaire. In contrast, statisticalsignificance was observed for the ‘disability’ variable, indicating that there are statisticallysignificant differences in perceptions of the level of inclusion in some of the factors of thescale between participants with and without disabilities. The preliminary analysis results(ANOVA) can be found in Appendix B.No significant differences were observed in the analysed dimensions, or else com-parisons within variables could not be conducted due to a limited number of participantsin some of their categories. Given this circumstance, and the desire to conduct a morein-depth analysis, owing to the unequal sub-sample sizes, it was decided to recode allvariables into dichotomous forms. These recoded variables were subsequently subjected toStudent’s t-tests, leading to new significant findings among the respondent groups (Table 8).Consequently, through this approach, the data analysis revealed noteworthy distinctions inthe variables “age”, “religion”, “academic degree”, “disability”, and “health problems”.In order to explore the relationship between the variable “age” and the results for thedifferent factors of the SAI scale, the pre-defined age categories 18–25 years, 26–36 years,37–50 years, and over 51 years were initially examined. However, no significant differenceswere found between these categories in relation to the scale scores. The age variable wasrecoded into two broad categories, considering that more than 60% of the participantsbelonged to the group of 18–25 year olds, while the rest were older than 25. In this analysis,a significant relationship was found around factor 2, called “Practices” (Table 8). It wasobserved that those aged 25 and over had a more inclusive perception of the choir’s“practices” factor, compared to those in the 18–25 age range.In the case of “religion”, the pre-established categories within the variable were prelim-inarily assessed. No significant relationships were found between these categories and thescale results. However, when a comparison analysis was carried out between participants whoidentified themselves as believers and those who identified themselves as non-believers, a sig-nificant relationship of the variable was identified around factor 2, “Practices”, of the inclusionassessment scale. It was found that people with religious beliefs had a higher perception ofinclusion in choir practices than those who self-reported as non-believers.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 12 of 23Table 8.

A comparison analysis was then carried out between two groups: those participantswith a university degree, and those without. In this analysis, a significant relationship wasidentified around factors 3 and 4 of the scale, i.e., “Policy” and “Community”, respectively(Table 8). It was observed that individuals without a university degree expressed a higherperception of inclusion in the choir’s policies and community compared to those individualswho had one.With regard to the “disability” variable, particularly significant relationships were foundbetween participants with and without disabilities and factors 2 and 3 of the inclusion scale,corresponding to “Practices” and “Policies”, respectively (Table 8). A notable association wasBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 13 of 23found between the presence of disability and a more inclusive perception of the choir, in theaspects related to policies and practices.The dimension of “physical and mental health problems” was assessed accordingto the pre-established categories within the variable. No significant relationships werefound between these categories and the results of the scale. However, when a comparisonanalysis was carried out between participants with and without pathologies, a substantialrelationship of the variable was identified around factors 3 and 4 of the scale, i.e., “Policies”and “Community” (Table 8). It was found that people without problems in these areasperceived a greater inclusion in the choir’s policies and community.4. DiscussionThe instrument used in this study has shown evidence of reliability and validity,partially coinciding with the original results of [15]. In terms of reliability, satisfactoryCronbach’s alpha coefficients were found for the total scores and individual factors, indi-cating an adequate internal consistency in the participants’ responses. In terms of validity,although partial modifications were made to the scale structure compared to the origi-nal version, the original four factors were retained, suggesting that the instrument stillcaptures the essential aspects of inclusion assessment. This evidence of reliability andvalidity supports the use of the instrument in the present study, and provides a basis forthe interpretation of the results. However, it would be interesting to further explore andvalidate the instrument in different contexts and populations, to gain a more completeunderstanding of its usefulness and applicability.The results support the hypothesis posited in the study, which stated that “if theanalysed project truly promotes inclusion, it was expected to receive high scores in all fourdimensions of inclusion”.Regarding the second hypothesis of this study, which posited that no significantdifferences would be found in inclusion scores based on sex, gender, age, tenure, or roleplayed in the project, initially, the results supported this assertion for all variables of interest.However, upon grouping responses by age variable, a significant difference was observedbetween respondents under 25 years old and those over 26 years old.The third hypothesis of this study asserted that significant differences in inclusionscores would be found in groups with and without disabilities. The obtained resultssupport this assertion, as individuals with recognised disabilities rated inclusion withsignificantly higher scores compared to participants without disabilities.Finally, with regard to the fourth hypothesis of this study, which posits that significantdifferences would be found based on special educational needs and physical or mental healthproblems, the results revealed a partial fulfilment of this hypothesis. No significant differenceswere found between individuals with and without special educational needs, indicating thatthis variable did not significantly influence the perception of inclusion. However, relevantdifferences were observed between individuals with and without physical or mental healthproblems, suggesting that this condition may impact perceptions of inclusion.The main objective of this study was to analyse the perception of inclusion of themembers participating in the Cantatutti Inclusive Choir, taking into account some of thevariables of interest that characterise their diversity, including whether or not they havea disability. For this purpose, an inclusion assessment scale has been used, covering fourfactors: Practices, Community, Policies, and Values [15].Significantly, the mean scores obtained for all factors are very low, indicating thatinclusion is assessed mostly positively. These results support the approach of [35], whichstated that if the project under analysis truly promotes inclusion, it would be expectedto obtain overtly positive scores on all four dimensions of inclusion. The strategies andpolicies implemented in this choir favour the rights, diversity, equality, and promotion of itsmembers. These findings are consistent with previous research [30,31,42], which highlightsthe importance of projects where music plays a key role as a working tool.Behav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 14 of 23It is also relevant to note that there is a minimal difference between the average scores ofthe different factors, with the perception of the project’s Values standing out positively. Of thefour factors analysed, the Values factor obtained a higher score, possibly due to the fact that itis a fundamental element around which Policies, Practices, and the Community are articulated.These results do not coincide with those obtained in [35], for whom the Practices factor scoredhigher, and represents the most visible and tangible element of inclusion, considering thatpractices concretise policies and cultures. The Values factor obtained a relatively low score,which the authors attribute to its more abstract and implicit nature, making it difficult toassess accurately. In this respect, it would be interesting to produce new research based on theSAI that would yield new results for comparison and discussion.Within the framework of the study, it has been observed that values play a key role,and score highly. These values should be focused on people and their individual abilities,especially valuing a climate of respect and acceptance towards the diversity of the members,as documented in previous research [29]. From the moment they join the choir, it must beensured that no one feels excluded, regardless of any personal, social, or cultural differencesthat may exist. This issue is of great relevance, as it highlights the need for values that focuson individuals and their potential to promote inclusion within the choir [17].On the one hand, a preliminary analysis of the data shows no significant differencesin the inclusion scores based on sex, gender, age, length of association, or role in theproject. However, when recoding the age variable, a significant difference was observedbetween respondents under 25 and those over 25. The fact that those aged 26 and overidentified the ‘practices’ as more inclusive compared to those aged 18–25 may be attributedto a possible generational influence. It is plausible to consider that younger individualsperceive inclusion more naturally, due to their exposure to a social environment that hasevolved towards more inclusive practices compared to those who, through their experience,have witnessed the transformation of society from times when inclusive practices were lessprevalent, or exclusively associated with the concept of integration [2].On the other hand, the results show that people with a recognised disability perceiveinclusion more significantly compared to non-disabled participants. The tendency ofpeople with a recognised disability to evaluate practices and policies more positively thannon-disabled participants could be related to their previous experiences in activities thathave been socially less inclusive [43]. These individuals may have experienced situationsin which they have not had the same opportunities as their peers, both in terms of specificpractices, and in relation to regulations and policies that seek to promote equity andinclusion in the educational environment [44]. It is, therefore, possible that their morefavourable assessment reflects a contrast between past experiences of exclusion and thecurrent inclusion measures implemented, in the context of the study.Furthermore, no significant differences were found between people with and withoutspecial educational needs, indicating that this variable did not significantly influenceperceptions of inclusion. However, notable differences were observed between people withand without physical or mental health problems, suggesting that this condition may havean impact on perceptions of inclusion. The observed tendency for people with physical ormental health problems, particularly those experiencing depression or anxiety, to give lowerscores on the evaluation of inclusion in terms of ‘community’ and ‘policies’ is interpretedas related to their social vulnerability [45]. These results provide relevant information forthe project in question, as they indicate the need to take specific measures to support thesepeople, and promote their greater sense of inclusion within the group. By consideringtheir vulnerable situation, the project can implement strategies and actions that addressthe specific barriers faced by these people, with the aim of fostering a greater sense ofbelonging and participation in the community.According to [28], participation in these musical experiences can strengthen the senseof community and of belonging to a group. In the context of these activities, all membersshould have the opportunity to contribute to the ensemble, and feel valued as an importantpart of it. It is especially relevant to note that more than half of the participants in this studyBehav. Sci. 2023, 13, 758 15 of 23identify with various forms of disabilities, disorders, addictions, or illnesses. Through activ-ities focused on strengthening choral activity and promoting socio-emotional development,choristers can find the support they need to make their individual contributions, whichhelps to foster their sense of inclusion and participation in the choral community.The results reveal other significant findings, such as the fact that people without auniversity education score higher on the “policy” and “community” factors, comparedto those with this kind of education. This phenomenon may be related, as in the case ofdisability, to the participants’ previous experiences, or to the fact that they feel included in aproject hosted by a university institution, despite the fact that they did not have a universityeducation. Equally, this result could also be related to the fact that people with a universityeducation have developed a reflective and critical attitude towards the opportunities forimprovement of an inclusive project. Their academic background and experience in theuniversity environment might have provided them with tools to more thoroughly analyseand evaluate the inclusion policies and practices implemented in the project [46].These results underline the importance of considering the diverse educational back-ground and life experience of participants when assessing inclusion in a project. Theyalso suggest the need to encourage participation and feedback from people with differenteducational backgrounds, as each group can bring valuable perspectives, to enrich inclusivepolicies and practices.This study has some limitations that should be taken into account when interpretingthe results. Firstly, the sample used may limit the generalisability of the findings, as itwas based on a specific population, and does not necessarily represent all inclusive choircontexts. In addition, the research focused on participants’ self-perception, which could besubject to individual bias and variation. The study did not control some external variablesthat could influence perceptions of inclusion, such as the social and cultural environment.Therefore, it seems pertinent to conduct future research with larger and more diversifiedsamples, as well as to incorporate new methods and data triangulation, in order to gain amore complete understanding of the phenomenon of inclusion in inclusive choirs.Although the validation procedure of the original instrument has been rigorously repli-cated, the explained variance, standing at 53.5%, may be deemed relatively moderate in specificcontexts. Consequently, judicious consideration is recommended. To bolster the instrument’sreliability and analytical depth, future research could replicate these findings across diversecohorts, and explore advanced statistical methodologies, such as structural equation mod-elling. These limitations underscore the imperative for ongoing validation and inquiry into theinstrument’s efficacy, to ensure its resilience and relevance across varied scenarios.It is important to acknowledge the limitations associated with converting responsesfrom instruments utilising categorical response formats into numerical values. In thisstudy, the commonly observed approach employed in analogous research was adheredto, to address this format. However, caution is advised when directly transforming Likertratings into numerical values. It is crucial to recognise that assuming an equidistant stepsize between labels, with a difference of 1, may not hold true unless explicitly stipulatedwithin the questionnaire itself. The intricacies inherent in response scaling underscore thesignificance of employing a well-considered methodology that respects the nuanced natureof response categories.Finally, for [35], it is of the utmost importance to assess the fundamental dimensionsof inclusion, taking into consideration the perception of all members involved in thecommunity. Future research, using complementary methodologies, such as in-depthinterviews or focus groups, can play a key role in providing further insights into thiscomplex and evolving phenomenon.Author Contributions: Conceptualisation, B.J.-M. and E.V.; methodology, E.V.; software, B.J.-M.;validation, I.N.-G., B.L.-C. and E.V.; formal analysis, E.V.; investigation, B.J.-M.; resources, B.J.-M.;data curation, B.J.-M.; writing—original draft preparation, B.J.-M.; writing—review and editing,B.J.-M.; visualisation, B.J.-M.; supervision, I.N.-G., B.L.-C. and E.V.

    "abstract": "Inclusion promotes equal opportunities, and aims to eliminate discrimination, by ensuring full access, participation, and representation for all individuals in society, with music playing a crucial role in addressing this global challenge, and fostering positive and inclusive change. The aim of this study is to identify perceptions of inclusive culture, policies, values, and practices in one specific inclusive choir in Spain. The sample consisted of 135 members, ranging from 18 to 79 years of age, of which 22.2% have recognised disabilities. All of them filled in the adapted Scale for the Assessment of Inclusion (SAI) form. The results show that, regardless of gender, age, and length of participation in the choir, their members share positive perceptions of the inclusiveness of its values, policies, practices, and culture. However, perceptions vary across the groups surveyed, and are generally more favourable among participants with a disability, those without a university education, or those aged 26 or over. It is found that people who participate in an inclusive choir, in which music is the mediating resource, perceive a high level of inclusion that allows them to feel they belong to a group where diversity, equality, and the promotion of people are respected. The findings are analysed, considering the importance of conducting multidimensional evaluations that include all members of an organisation",
