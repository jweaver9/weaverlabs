Greabe, The Tension Between Equal Protection and Religious Freedom, Concord Monitor, Apr. 9, 2017 at D1, D4.The tension between equal protection and religious freedom JOHN GREABE Constitutional Connections T he Constitution did not become ' our basic law at a single point in time. We ratified its first seven ar­ticles in 1788 but have since amended it 27 times. Many of these amendments memorialize fundamental shifts in val­ues. Thus, it should come as no surprise to learn that the Constitution is not an internally consistent document. Some of its provisions obviously conflict with others. For example, the Constitution originally advanced the in­terests ofslave owners-and states de­pendent on slavery-by requiring the return of fugitive slaves and counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for ap­portionment purposes. Yet the 13th Amendment, adopted at the conclusion of the Civil War, effectively nullified these provisions by banning slavery. The older provisions, although still for­mally part of the Constitution, are now nothing more than stark reminders of a shameful past. Other constitutional provisions ­even provisions that were simultane­ously enacted-protect freedoms that can come into conflict with one another. The First Amendment, for example, promises both freedom from govern­mental endorsement of religion and freedom from governmental interfer­ence with religious practice. But how do these provisions apply when a reli­gious group seeks to use a public facil­ity-say, a public high school audito­rium - that is made available for use by other non-religious groups from out­side the school? Must the school turn the religious group away· in order to maintain a proper separation of church and state? Orwould rejecting the religious group's application constitute uncon­stitutional discrimination against reli­gion by the state? The Supreme Court SEE CONSTITUTION 04 D4 CONCORD MONITOR I Sunday, April 9, 2017 FORUM concordmonitor.com Will courts harmonize equal-protection, religious-liberty guarantees? CONSTITUTION FROM 01 has taken the latter view. A similar tension exists be­tween the Constitution's guar­antee ofequal protection and its promise of religious liberty. The equal protection guaran­tee provides protection against certain forms of state-spon­sored discrimination. Yet the religious liberty principle pro­tects the rights of churches and people of faith to advocate and act on religious beliefs ­beliefs that can conflict with freedoms protected by anti-dis­crimination law. This tensionhas height­ened as society has moved to extendanti-discriminationpro­tections to persons with a same-sex sexual orientation, to transgender individuals and to other persons who identify as LGBTQ. The United States Supreme Court has not been clear about whether, under the equal pro­tection guarantee, all discrimi­nation against LGBTQ individ­uals is to be treated as pre­sumptively unconstitutional. But in 2015, inObergefeU v. Hodges, the court extended the flindamental right of marriage to same-sex couples. This was a huge step forward for those who favor protecting LGBTQ rights, even ifthe doctrinal ba­sis forthe court's ruling was less than fully clear. Inaddition, although Congress has not explicitly protected the LGBTQ commu­nity underfederal anti-dis­crimination laws, federal courts and agencies have in­tell>reted existing law to ex­tend at least some protections to members of this group. In­deed, just this week, a federal appeals court in Chicago held that the federal ban on \"sex discrimination\" in the work­place also applies to discrimi­nation on the basis of sexual orientation. '!'he tension between the equal protection and religious freedom is more vividly on dis­playat the state level Following the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage de­cision, some states enacted laws designed to protect claims of religious liberty. Mis­sissippi, for example, recently passed a statute authorizing businesses to deny services based on religious opposition to same-sex marriage, extra­marital sex and gender transi­tions. The law was successfully challenged on the grounds that, among other things, it un­constitutionally denies tho$e discriminated against equal protection of the law. An appeal from this ruling is pending. Other states, in contrast, have adopted measures that explicitly extend statutory anti-discrimination protections to the LGBTQ community. In several high-profile cases, these laws have been enforced against businesses·that re­fused service to same-sex cou­ples because of religious oppo­sition to same-sex marriage. In these cases, the businesses ar­gued-unsuccessfully- that application of these anti-dis­crimination laws would deny them their constitutional right to religious liberty. A 1990 Supreme Court deci­sion,Employment Division v. Smith, has played an impor­tant role in causing courts to privilege anti-discrimination claims made by members of the LGBTQ community over competing religious-freedom claims. In that case, the court refused to exempt persons fired from their jobs for illegal drug use during a religious rit­ual from a -state law barring those fired for illegal drug use from collecting unemployment benefits. The court acknowledged that those challenging the law had used the drugs while prac­ticing their faith. Nevertheless, the court held, a state may en­force a generally applicable prohibition on conduct even when a person engages in the prohibited conduct for reli­gious reasons. Under the logic ofthis ruling, courts may en­force the federal Equal Protec­tion Clause and federal and state anti-discrimination laws against persons claiming that compliance with such laws in­trudes upon their religious lib­erty. Looking ahead, willcourts continue to harmonize the equal-protection and religious­liberty guarantees in this wa-y? The answer is farfrom clear. TheSmithdecision has come under intense criticism since the day it was handed down. Moreover, the Supreme Court contains several members who have expressed concerns that current law devalues legiti­mate claims of religious liberty. Finally, the court is poised to welcome a new member-Neil Gorsuch-who may well be sympathetic to this view. Even with the matter of same-sex marriage settled, the tension between the constitu­tional guarantees of equal pro­tection and religious liberty willalmost certainly receive further attention from the Supreme Court.
