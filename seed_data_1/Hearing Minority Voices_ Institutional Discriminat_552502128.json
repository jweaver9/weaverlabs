Disaster vulnerability identifies diversity in societythrough a lens of constraints to solutions, on such bases as demography, socio-economicstatus, cultural, ethnic and gendered minorities within society, and marginalized groups aswell as physical proximity to a hazard. The focus of disaster risk reduction is on buildingresilience through the strengths and capacities in society, but it has a tendency to ho-mogenize characteristics of resilience to the community level, thereby flattening and hidingdiversity. LGBTQ people are largely ignored as minority groups with specific informationneeds. Specific response and recovery processes and actors exacerbate the vulnerability ofthe LGBTQ minority, especially in evacuation, support, counselling, and rehousing. Therole of faith-based organizations (FBO) in providing these services during disaster reliefand recovery is examined in this paper. This paper identifies and critiques the attitudes andpractices of some FBO towards LGBTQ groups in their provision of disaster relief services.Keywords: LGBTQ; disaster relief and recovery; faith-based organizations; vulnerabilityand resilience; diversity of needs; discrimination.1.

The vulnerability of LGBTQ people is exacerbatedduring disaster events as a consequence of homophobic discrimination and in-sensitivity towards their needs. Within this identification of enhanced vulnerability,a problematic issue that is identified in the literature concerns a trend towardsprivatization of disaster relief and recovery support services to faith-based orga-nizations (FBO), especially conservative Christian agencies that are hostile to-wards LGBTQ people. The danger of increasing discrimination towards LGBTQpeople by such FBO during and following a disaster is a primary focus of thispaper. The aim is to identify the risk in order to enable policy and practice strat-egies to reduce that risk and enhance the resilience of this minority group in theface of disaster.First, this paper briefly examines the broader context of Disaster Risk Reductionbefore examining a range of themes around LGBTQ vulnerability that are iden-tified in the literature, and especially the increasing roles of FBO in relief andrecovery. Since the 1990s, International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction(IDNDR) emergency management has shifted its emphasis from vulnerability toresilience, with international strategies aimed at building and enhancing resilience.Diversity is acknowledged in our understanding of vulnerability, but less so inresilience enhancement. Vulnerability is defined in relation to different demo-graphic, social economic, cultural, and special needs groups (Anderson-Berry andKing 2005). While vulnerability recognizes the susceptibility to risk in individualsand groups, resilience builds on the strengths of people and communities. Con-sequently, resilience tends to focus on the whole community and is less sensitive todiversity. Within a strategy of building resilient communities, communication,warnings, education and messages are aimed at an amorphous public (King 2010).There is a tendency to homogenize society. The complication of these two conceptsof vulnerability and resilience is that people are both vulnerable and resilient at thesame time (Handmer 2003; Gurtner and King 2021). These are not at oppositeends of a single scale but are interacting parallel conditions of being.One response amongst disaster researchers and emergency managers has beento attempt to diversify messages (Young and Jones 2022). There is a recognition ofdifferences in demographics, class and social economic status, culture and eth-nicity, language, geography, and gender. Thus, as an example, the Centre forDisaster Studies, James Cook University, Australia pursued work on awarenessand education for children and subsequently for Australian indigenous people asexamples of diversity as much as targeting specific needs.In disaster risk reduction, the emergence of the recognition of LGBTQ peopleand communities has mostly taken place in the last couple of decades, although itshould be noted that it is within this same timescale that emergency managementD King2241005-2J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.has attempted to diversify its messages. There is some linkage through gender andfeminism, but increasingly, the emphasis is specific to diverse sexualities and thedifficulties of LGBTQ people in facing social acceptance. Whereas the need torecognize diversity in relation to emergency management messages, guidelines,and warnings was focused on appropriate language, terminology, and under-standing, the social marginalization issues in relation to LGBTQ members ofsociety are less in language (although heteronormative terms, attitudes andassumptions distort messages and awareness) than overt exclusion in someinstances from disaster relief, services and facilities, and recovery support. Socialhomophobia that exists in day-to-day attitudes to LGBTQ people is sharpened andin some situations has emerged as overt discrimination during the phases of di-saster relief and recovery.2. MethodA literature review was carried out through a number of internet search enginesusing the variety of abbreviations around the terms lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans,transgender, transsexual and queer, intersex and plus in their various combinationsthat are defined and discussed below. These were combined with the terms disaster,crisis, climate change, extreme events and sub sets of response, recovery andemergency management. The range and breadth of experiences and issues is in-dicative rather than exhaustive. The review in turn identified a limited number ofrelated reviews which bring together findings that are summarized here. Ratherthan repeating a similar summary of each paper identified in these reviews, thispaper identifies the issues that are reported in each paper. In particular, this paperseeks to identify specific issues and finds the role of FBOs in disaster relief serviceprovision a problem that requires both further research and ameliorative action.The literature of LGBTQ experiences that are summarized in this paper iden-tifies loss of privacy, discrimination, rejection, condemnation and in some socie-ties, vulnerability to arrest and imprisonment. This paper therefore reviews theliterature of experiences from the perspectives of: (1) Emergency managementmessages and diversity; (2) LGBTQ experiences in disasters; (3) FBO in theLGBTQ experience; (4) LGBTQ resilience and leadership in disaster.As LGBTQ people have gained acceptance and recognition in some societies,research and analysis of LGBTQ as minorities has gained traction with focus inareas of feminist and gender geography where gay and lesbian spaces and queertheory have generated an extensive literature that is not the focus of this paper(Hubbard 2016; Gaillard et al. 2017). Against this background of scholarship, aconsideration of LGBTQ experience in disasters has emerged in recent decadesHearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-3J. of Extr.

Larkin (2019) carried out a global review of LGBTQ experiences.She identified 172 papers and reports, narrowing these down to 38 which wereultimately selected for analysis of themes and issues. The issues she identifies arecited in this paper as a summary of her review. Wisner and Gaillard (2009), Larkin(2019) and Dominey-Howes et al. (2014) refer to a lack of research “specific togender and sex minorities in disasters” (Larkin 2019: 61), but Larkin's (2019)literature review captures a range of issues, shortcomings, and policy responsesacross a number of nations – USA, India, Nepal, Samoa, Indonesia, Haiti,Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Philippines (also Knight and Sollom 2012).Larkin's (2019) review lists discrimination and vulnerability, policy gaps, lack ofLGBTQ access to relief combined with lack of trust of agencies by members of theLGBTQ community, along with the destruction and loss of safe places and pro-blems associated with relief provision by FBO. She also summarizes the resilienceof LGBTQ groups, the contributions of many LGBTQ people to DRR leadershipand relief, and the emergence of inclusive policy. A more specialist coverage in theForced Migration Review journal (Couldrey and Herson 2013) focused on theexperiences of LGBTQ refugees in 26 case studies. While 10 of the articles aregenerically global, the plight of LGBTQ refugees is identified in Eastern Europe, theEU, Myanmar/Burmese migrants in Thailand, Canada, Brazil, UK, Korea, Kosovo,Bolivia, USA, Israel, Kenya, and Nepal.Dominey-Howes et al. (2014) approached the experience through five case studydisasters in the USA, Haiti, India, Philippines, and Indonesia to identify issues andservice needs, concluding by calling for more extensive baseline research. By 2021,Goldsmith and Raditz reviewed an extensive literature of the impact of disasters onLGBTQ communities, focusing on the USA, that identified issues of limited serviceprovision, recognition of LGBTQ, the problems associated with discriminatorypractices of FBOs, and entrenchment of existing inequalities. Their review identifiesissues of bias and discrimination in service provision to LGBTQ people, a lack ofrecognition of LGBTQ individuals and couples, problems with services provided byFBOs, as well as poverty, homelessness, mental health, health needs amongst theLGBTQcommunitymembers and outright blame being placed onLGBTQpeople byFBOs, especially those of the fundamentalist Christian right. Recommendationsfrom their review focus on anti-discrimination training, community-based responseand health care. However, they also point to a lack of empirical studies (Goldsmithand Raditz 2021), a lack earlier identified by Gaillard et al. (2017). This lack ofempirical studies is noted by Goldsmith and Raditz as contributing to an absence ofLGBTQ recognition in DRR policy.Examples of surveys of LGBTQ respondents are recent and most are quite small(Carman et al. 2020; Parkinson et al. 2018; Haworth 2021) but COVID-19 hasD King2241005-4J. of Extr.

Privacy and trust are disincentives to participation insurveys, despite ethical assurances, but greater constraints to web-based surveysare researcher identification of networks and permission to share requests to ensurethe safety of respondents. Despite these research constraints, surveys and inter-views illustrate and reinforce themes and issues of LGBTIQ experiences. Thus,there are already significant research studies and case studies that underscore thedifficulties faced by LGBTQ people during and after disaster.3. Emergency Management MessagesFollowing the UN IDNDR, the top down command and control model of emer-gency Management has steadily transformed (King 2004a) towards inclusion,cooperation, and recognition of diversity. The relative recency of this change inemphasis partially explains why many minority groups in society have beenneglected. Furthermore, the heteronormative language of emergency managementinformation (Gorman-Murray et al. 2019) extends across society in media, ad-vertising, public information and general assumptions on what is normal(Hubbard 2016). Minorities and subgroups are recognized and often addressed, butunder an umbrella of heteronormative images and assumptions. The informationneeds of indigenous people in Australia, for example, have for a long time beenignored because of a cultural blindness (Wensing 2012, 2016). This blindness ispervasive and extends beyond a failure to recognize indigenous people (Gaillardet al. 2017) LGBTQ people are confronted with information and hazard awarenesscampaigns that often portray nuclear families or heterosexual couples doing theright thing. Gaillard (2022) suggests that the language of emergency managementand DRR is western in origin, thereby assuming a cultural norm that exacerbatesblindness or fails to account for cultural complexity, especially the needs of mi-norities. Gaillard asserts that gender is presented as binary — not diverse.At the very least such heteronormative portrayals are irritating — manyLGBTQ people have long grown accustomed to such images and information —but more pervasively, it goes over the heads of individuals, failing to engage thembecause it is not about them. This is how multiple minorities are excluded fromsafety messages (King 2004b). Education and awareness raising are importantissues for hazard preparation and personal and community safety, where greaterdiversity can and needs to be incorporated into the safety messaging. However,most of the literature reviewed is focused upon LGBTQ experiences during andafter disasters during the relief and recovery phases.Hearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-5J. of Extr.

Themes in the Literature Concerning LGBTQ Experiencesin DisastersThe review that was carried out in preparing this paper identified five groups ofthemes and issues. These are diversity of and within the LGBTQ minority, dis-crimination, issues around service provision and health needs, inequality risk andexclusion, privacy and trust, and the primary focus of this paper, the part played byFBO in LGBTQ Disaster Experiences. It is because some Christian FBO areincreasingly part of a trend towards privatization of relief and recovery servicesthat each of these issues and themes needs to be explained. The five issues that areidentified below are not separate from the role of FBO, but rather are exacerbatedby some of those agencies. This paper summarizes these issues and themes andthen focusses on the problem of discriminatory FBOs in provision of disaster reliefand recovery services.4.1. DiversityA crucial starting point to a review of problems and issues is the recognition of alack of homogeneity of the LGBTQ community (Dominey-Howes et al. 2014).The papers and reports that have been reviewed for this paper use a range of termswhere LGBT is common to all, but variants include I for intersex, Q for queer orquestioning andþ as an umbrella for several additional positions of sexuality. Ng(2015) uses LGBT in reference to Chinese activism on the grounds that the Q is notused in China, although she recognizes the increased popularity of LGBTQ. Itwould be correct to cite the exact abbreviation as it is cited in each paper, but thiscan be awkward in terms of changing use throughout this paper, and manyexperiences and issues are cited by multiple scholars who often use slightly dif-ferent abbreviations. This paper uses LGBTQ for convenience and inclusivity, butstresses that it represents considerable diversity within a population of diversesexuality. LGBTQ, is used by the Q Christian Fellowship, formerly the GayChristian Movement, whose organizational name change and choice, with a þ aswell, is illustrative of its attempt to extend inclusivity among diverse people whoare victims of active discrimination but who are exercising their need to come toterms with a discriminatory organization — the church.Dwyer's (2022) tool for evaluating inclusion uses the term Sexual Orientations,Gender Identities and Expressions and Sex Characteristics (SOGIESC) as a sub-stitute for LGBTIQþ. The complexity of the variance of the abbreviations forLGBTQ symbolizes the diversity of the minorities within a minority. There is nosingle experience, socially, and specifically in disaster (Dominey-Howeset al. 2014; Haworth 2021). Each disaster is unique as is the impact on individualsD King2241005-6J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.and communities, but there are common themes of disaster vulnerability thatrecognize greater impacts on vulnerable groups including all minorities (Anderson-Berry and King 2005; Haskell 2014). Parkinson et al. (2018) and Gorman-Murrayet al. (2019) point to the specific needs of transindividuals,whileCarman et al. (2020)and Gorman-Murray et al. (2019) stress that post-disaster services are generic andnot geared to diversity.4.2. DiscriminationDiscrimination against LGBTQ is overt and crosses national and cultural bound-aries (Goldsmith and Raditz 2021; Larkin 2019; Parkinson et al. 2018; UnitedNations Human Rights 2020). Homophobia stigmatizes LGBTQ people(Parkinson et al. 2018). Religious homophobia extends prejudice to includeblaming LGBTQ people for disasters (Goldsmith and Raditz 2021; Richards 2010;Haskell 2014; Stukes 2014). The implications of religious homophobia are ex-panded upon later. Apart from overt discrimination policies, media and services aremore commonly blind to LGBTQ (Gorman-Murray et al. 2019).The Sendai1 framework addresses social differences, but presents gender asbinary (Gorman-Murray et al. 2019). Goldsmith and Raditz (2021), Larkin (2019),and Parkinson et al. (2018) all point to bias and lack of recognition of LGBTQpeople, with Gaillard et al. (2017) adding that while there is a general recognitionof minorities in social service provision, this is largely absent in disaster riskreduction.4.3. Service provision and health needsDiscrimination is practiced in the refusal of agencies, such as NGOs that are taskedwith disaster relief, including and especially some FBOs, in their provision ofhealth and service needs, as well as access to services (Parkinson et al. 2018;Larkin 2019). A specific issue identified by Gaillard et al. (2017) and Stukes(2014) is the provision of appropriate bathroom facilities for transpeople inevacuation centers. There are jurisdictions that do not recognize LGBTQ partners(Haskell 2014) and even where legal rights exist, partners are excluded from somehealth provisions such as recognition of same sex partners as next of kin duringdisaster response (Haskell 2014). Inadequacy of health needs provision and1Three world conferences on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) have been hosted by the UN Inter-national Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) to establish DRR strategies and policy frameworksfor adoption by countries. Each has built upon and extended its predecessor — the YokohamaStrategy in 1994, the Hyogo Framework for Action at Kobe in 2005 and the Sendai Framework forDisaster Risk Reduction at Sendai in 2015 — all in Japan.Hearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-7J. of Extr.

(2021), and Gorman-Murray et al. (2019).4.4. Inequality risk and exclusionDespite public leadership and articulation by many middle-class gay and lesbianindividuals, there is a general pattern of lower social economic status, homeless-ness, unemployment, and economic disadvantage in the diverse LGBTQ com-munity (Goldsmith and Raditz 2021; Carman et al. 2020; UN 2020;Haskell 2014; Stukes 2014). Inequalities across the diversity of LGBTQ peopleand communities are exemplified in racial and gender divisions (Haskell 2014;Stukes 2014). Transindividuals and partners are especially vulnerable, both interms of general poverty and intensification of discrimination and exclusion in adisaster (Carman et al. 2020). Consequently many LGBTQ people are marginal-ized, living on the edges in terms of housing and income (Goldsmith andRaditz 2021). Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified pre-existing so-cial and economic inequalities (Haworth 2021, 2022) adding significantly tomental health impacts (Grant et al. 2021). During disaster response, evacuationand relief, risk has been enhanced for many LGBTQ people, including incidents ofviolence in evacuation centers (Parkinson et al. 2018), as well as increased do-mestic violence (United Nations Human Rights 2020) and access to appropriatefacilities (Nicholson 2022).5. Privacy and TrustHaskell (2014) and Stukes (2014) wrote against a background case study ofLGBTQ people’s experiences in Hurricane Katrina. They point out that for manypeople, this disaster was the first time of being out in public. Haskell (2014) arguesthat many LGBTQ people are privately out but publicly closeted. The idea of acloset can be somewhat divisive amongst LGBTQ communities as it is associatedwith being hidden from sight in contrast to Gay Pride and the experience of being‘out’ in the mainstream community. Being out is not simple for many LGBTQpeople. It may invite discrimination, loss of employment and career, and homo-phobic violence. In complex roles of service provision, LGBTQ individuals maybe faced with subjugating their own needs and rights in front of the albeit mis-guided conservative attitudes of the clients or the community they serve. This istypified in the dilemma of LGBTQ religious leaders and workers whose mission isto serve people who would otherwise reject and vilify them. Haskell refers to“stories of closeted LGBT unheard” (2014:10). People seek privacy for securityand safety (Carman et al. 2020; Grant et al. 2021; Larkin 2019; Goh 2018). SafeD King2241005-8J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.spaces are lost in a disaster, in some cases physically destroyed (Larkin 2019;Haskell 2014), but in others interrupted or temporarily lost, including online places(Grant et al. 2021; Gaillard et al. 2017). The reciprocity of trust between institu-tions and LGBTQ individuals is a repeated theme aimed at enhancing resilienceand communication and reducing vulnerability (Haworth 2022; Gaillard 2022;Dwyer 2022; Duckworth 2022).LGBTQ people seek privacy and safe places. Being out, LGBTQ may invitedanger or discrimination or may restrict careers and community roles of service toothers. Surveys and reviews report a lack of trust of mainstream service providers(Carman et al. 2021; Larkin 2019). Stukes (2014) identifies the loss of specific safeplaces in NewOrleans following Hurricane Katrina. The loss of a local MetropolitanCommunity Church (MCC — a diverse affirming church organization) and subse-quent involvement of otherMCCs played a significant role in terms of initial loss andthen the recovery of safety and support. Even without a lack of trust, LGBTQrespondents identified heteronormative information, and specifically language andadvice that is unfriendly towards transpeople (Haskell 2014; Larkin 2019).All of the issues that are summarized above may be targeted and their negativeimpacts reduced, by strategies and policies that encourage best practice responsi-bilities on the part of individual service providers and their organizations. Disasterrelief and recovery programs may be evaluated in terms of either their effectiveness orbias. For example Dwyer (2022) presents a risk assessment matrix as a rapid as-sessment tool of inclusion of LGBTQ (SOGIESC) people in disaster assistanceprograms. This identifies a continuum of hostile, unaware, inactive, inclusive, throughto transformative. Thismatrix is subdivided by impact, cause and examples. The basicrisk evaluation matrix is summarized in Table 1. Each cell in Dwyer's original table(Dwyer 2022, p. 35) identifies detailed examples of situations and strategies. Theseare not reproduced in Table 1 which is a summary of the matrix categoriesUnder hostile practices, the impact is identified as ‘norms-based marginalizationand exclusion of people with diverse SOGIESC is exacerbated’ (Dwyer 2022,p. 35). In the next cell of the matrix, the cause is identified as ‘The organization isaware of likely negative impact on people with diverse SOGIESC but goes aheadanyway because either it chooses not to address diverse SOGIESC issues orTable 1. Outline of Program Risk Evaluation MatrixHostile Unaware Inactive Inclusive TransformativeImpactCauseExamplesSource: Dwyer 2022, p. 35.Hearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-9J. of Extr.

Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.actively discriminates against people with diverse SOGIESC’ (Dwyer 2022,p. 35). It is especially significant that for a tool that was developed in the PacificIsland nation of Vanuatu, the hostile example that is cited is ‘A faith-based or-ganization is contracted to deliver relief, however its theology commitments orthose of its in-country partners cast people with diverse SOGIESC as sinners; OR asecular organization puts aside SOGIESC concerns because they prefer to use thefunds elsewhere or do not want to deal with the complexities of this work.’(Dwyer 2022, p. 35).However the matrix cells of impact, cause and examples become progressivelyless harmful in each of unaware and inactive, and are positive and thus desirableproject goals in the inclusive and transformative columns. The impact of a trans-formative goal is ‘norms-based marginalization and exclusion of people with di-verse SOGIESC is ameliorated and challenged’, the cause is that ‘the organizationhas developed competency to challenge norms-based discrimination that excludespeople with diverse SOGIESC. It has revised its ways of working and has pro-grams and partnerships that positively include people with diverse SOGIESC inmainstream programs while offering targeted alternative programs where safetyrequires’ and an example is ‘A cash-based social protection program designed inpartnership with diverse SOGIESC CSOs and accounts for the impact of diverseSOGIESC marginalization on family and community relationships. The programprovides holistic support that addresses longer-term livelihood challenges andcounters community stigma’ (Dwyer 2022, p. 35). The value of this tool is inapplying it across a range of cultures, locations, and extreme events. In particular, itturns the focus round from the bad and harmful, while clearly identifying whatthese harmful actions are, to the positive inclusive and transformative approachesthat enable resilience, capacity and trust to be built with LGBTQ people (hereabbreviated to SOGIESC).While homosexuality remains a criminal offence in some countries (69 coun-tries mostly in Africa and the Middle East, Reality Check team 2021), there havebeen many positive trends towards acceptance, tolerance and inclusion. Govern-ment agency processes, policies and legislation, especially in western countries,acknowledge diversity, even though in Disaster Risk Reduction there is some wayto go. Where direct government services are involved in disaster relief and re-covery it is relatively straightforward to evaluate projects and train employees todo the right thing. However, services which are provided by FBO may involvesome agencies and individuals who filter their responses and treatment of LGBTQpeople in particular, through a lens of scriptural dogma.D King2241005-10J. of Extr.

Faith-Based Organizations in LGBTQ Disaster ExperiencesIt is in the areas of relief and services provided by FBO that researchers haveidentified the most blatant prejudice and discrimination (Stukes 2014;Richards 2010; Haskell 2014; Goldsmith and Raditz 2021). Governments in manyparts of the world have either devolved welfare services inadvertently to FBO, orhave left such services to organizations that have long provided relief, evacuationcenters and temporary shelter (Wisner 2010). On the face of it, this is a rationalsharing of the workload. Throughout the world, faith-based agencies operate at thesmaller scales of local involvement, with buildings, personnel, and ideologies thaturge the provision of assistance and care to people in need and suffering (Ng 2015;Hackworth and Akers 2010).Religious faith provides motivation and purpose for citizens to want to helppeople who are in need or are suffering (Ng 2015; Hackworth and Akers 2010;Ager et al. 2015). Not only from the perspective of the giver, the recipients ofservices from FBO may experience a greater spiritual support and meaning thatgoes beyond the purely physical support and assistance (Ager et al. 2015). Attimes of disaster, many people who are not normally religious, turn to faithinstitutions for comfort and meaning. This transcends the world religions. Islamic,Buddhist, and Judaistic as well as Christian FBO respond to community needs indisaster (Ferris 2005; Baidhawy 2015; Wirtz and Ecke 2014; Ng 2015;Kawai 2014; Wisner 2010). The term FBO includes everything from local chur-ches, mosques, temples or synagogues, etc. through to the hierarchy of the religionand service provision organizations that they have established to meet specificneeds. Involvement of FBO is global and cross cultural, and scales from the localto international. In many instances, probably for most people, the response andrelief experience is positive and supportive. However, minorities are vulnerable topre-existing prejudices and social vilification attitudes, which in the context of thispaper focusses on the activities of some conservative Christian agencies. LGBTQindividuals may have avoided conflict or confrontation through privacy and a lowprofile, but in a disaster people are forced into the sphere of influence of bothgovernment and non-government organizations including FBO.At the local level, immediate response and recovery is driven by local indivi-duals and community groups. LGBTQ people may be limited in their access to arange of services in small communities, but in such places, the providers mayalready be known. Post-disaster services and relief are provided by governmentdepartments, from central to local and NGOs as well as FBOs. In a small com-munity where people may be members of multiple clubs and organizations, reliefservices are provided by known community members rather than a facelessHearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-11J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22.

Communityself-help breaks down in more severe disasters where local capacity may bedestroyed and relief is brought in from outside by strangers. In a government-basedhierarchy, this ramps up to calls for assistance from larger jurisdictions.At the same time, throughout the world, governments have downsized andprivatized services; even authoritarian regimes such as China (Ng 2015). In thedeveloping world, governments are frequently weak and under resourced.Alongside such limitations, two processes have driven the shift from governmentprovided services to increasing reliance on non-government organizations (local,international, and faith-based). In the developing world, because governments areunder resourced and often weak in terms of governance, there is a reliance on non-government organizations (King 2004b). In the developed world, the trend hasbeen towards downsizing of government services generally, but also as part of theneoliberal agenda. This has resulted in devolution of services to the private sector,which includes FBOs (Hackworth and Akers 2010; Ng 2015; Riera andPoirier 2014). In some cases, the devolution to FBOs was probably unintended butin societies such as USA, many Christian organizations are strongly committed toneoliberalism and supportive of conservative governments (Hackworth andAkers 2010). Concurrently, these FBOs are frequently anti-big government, an-swerable to their faith base and independent of government processes in terms oftraining, practice and inclusion. FBOs enter communities and countries with a setorganizational agenda that is often not modified to meet local needs (King 2004b).They provide services in which they are skilled and committed with minimalreference to local needs, while many at the same time proselytize.Riera and Poirier (2014) describe UNHCR reliance on faith-based agencies inthe running of refugee camps, and identify discrimination practices against mi-norities and people of other faiths as well as LGBTQ. Couldrey and Herson's(2013) edited collection lists 26 case studies of discrimination and poor practice inrelation to forced migrants with specific focus on LGBTQ. Hackworth and Akers(2010) cite the example of NORM, the New Orleans Rescue Mission. NORM waspositively supported by a United States government that was not only set on apurposeful neoliberal devolution of services, but which had also run down FederalEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the point where it was not able toprovide proper response to the catastrophe of Hurricane Katrina. NORM requiredrelief recipients to attend church, were they were proselytized by a fundamentalistinterpretation of faith and judgment. Many other FBO involved in relief in NewD King2241005-12J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.Orleans after Katrina were also very evangelical. These state supported FBO hadlittle or no association with pre-existing churches, especially African-American.Thus when they emerged as major providers of relief services after HurricaneKatrina they had no local relationship on which to build in many of the poorer partsof New Orleans. Stukes (2014) additionally cites the initial incapacity of theLGBTQ Metropolitan churches (MCC) to service its own community because ofalienation of LGBTQ people by the broader evangelical churches that had gen-erated a distrust of all FBO.Within Christianity (as well as Islam and other world religions which are not thefocus of this paper), a major rift has long existed between the evangelical, fun-damentalist Christian right, and the liberal traditions which are most often iden-tified in the more established denominations. It is against this trend of servicedevolution to FBO that increasing relief and care falls into the hands of someintolerant organizations, as well as the more tolerant liberal FBO. FBO are ex-tremely diverse. This critique of negative and intolerant practices is specific tosome FBOs.LGBTQ experiences in disaster identify homophobia, stigmatization, blame andprejudice (Parkinson et al. 2018; Goldsmith and Raditz 2021; Richards 2010;Haskell 2014; Stukes 2014). The same researchers, as well as those who focus onFBO (Ng 2015; Hackworth and Akers 2010; Ager et al. 2015; Stukes 2014;Ng 2015), cite examples of evangelists placing blame for disaster on LGBTQpeople as God’s punishment for sins. Consequently some FBO providing reliefservices have practiced exclusion, refusing to assist LGBTQ people and especiallythose who are trans (Stukes 2014; Riera and Poirier 2014; Richards 2010;Couldrey and Herson 2013; Ng 2015).Ng's (2015) case study of Uganda explains how U.S. based evangelists whippedup homophobia in a predominantly Christian population in the period leading up to2014 when the death penalty was introduced (and later annulled) for some ho-mosexual acts. However, she also shows how FBO specifically Christian Inter-national Non-Government Organizations worked with the Chinese government toprovide welfare services which included LGBTQ recipients. Similar inferencesmay be drawn from the Hurricane Katrina experience (Stukes 2014; Hackworthand Akers 2010) that suggest that government leadership and control of FBO iscritical either in tacitly condoning, or actively supporting discrimination by FBO,or alternatively in framing inclusionary non-discriminatory provision of aid.Dominey-Howes et al. (2016) specify sound recommendations to direct FBO inproviding relief, and the staffing of evacuation and recovery centers in such a wayto include LGBTQ people within the broader legislative framework that outlawsdiscrimination. There are contradictory positions where a government (such asHearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-13J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.Australia’s legislative proposal on religious discrimination) would permit dis-crimination by FBO on the grounds of theological interpretation and freedom ofreligion, while simultaneously outlawing discrimination in terms of human rights,specifically as practiced against LGBTQ individuals.Dominey-Howes et al. (2016) make a specific recommendation calling forLGBTQ people of faith to examine how they manage relations between faith andsecular society and especially in the disaster situation. This is very much easier saidthan done. In this review paper, it is this statement that generates a researchquestion that is significant to the experience of LGBTQ people receiving disasterrelief from FBOs. Stukes (2014: 73–74) in her thesis explains her personal in-volvement as an African American Lesbian emergency manager. The experiencesidentified in many of the articles cited in this paper are already evident fromqualitative research of the stories and accounts of rejection and discrimination inthe Christian church in its day to day, pre-disaster dealings with its LGBTQmembers. The experience of LGBTQ Christians in terms of their general self-conflict and direct conflict with their churches and communities is a focus ofbackground research that is compiling faith discussions and written explanation(QCF 2021). The diverse LGBTQ Christian community struggles in bringingchange, or at least acceptance and safety, within their churches. These tensions andconservative attitudes then extend into the disaster event when FBOs provide reliefand recovery services, intentionally or inadvertently bringing discriminatory atti-tudes to strangers in the wider community. FBOs are ill suited or unable to accepttheir own LGBTQ members, they are by extension liable to disengage and mar-ginalize LGBTQ people in the broader community.Many LGBTQ people are distrustful of religious organizations, and like asignificant proportion of the population in the Western world, do not attend areligious institution. They distrust FBO because of their stated condemnatoryattitudes, their vilification and blame (Goh 2018). These attitudes can be avoidedmost of the time for most LGBTQ people by staying away from religion andhaving nothing to do with it. However, for many LGBTQ people, the most directconfrontation with the attitudes of FBO will come when there is no alternativerelief provider in a disaster. At such a time, the vulnerable individual and theintolerant organization come into contact and confrontation.LGBTQ people of faith on the inside of the religious organization can experi-ence far worse. The Q Christian Fellowship (formerly Gay Christian Movement)published a series of personal accounts by members of their struggle to come toterms with sexuality, faith, rejection, and acceptance (QCF 2021). Experiences ofLGBTQ people inside the church and especially those in evangelical fundamen-talist denominations extend through rejection by family and community, self-D King2241005-14J. of Extr. Even.

LGBTQ people who remain in FBO do so despite the hatred andvilification of them either as individuals or as members of a minority. In most FBO,the task of negotiating with or changing the organization is extremely difficult.Some Christians move to tolerant or affirming, or even specifically LGBTQchurches, such as Metropolitan Community Church, (MCC) but these are small innumber and location. Most LGBTQ people of faith find support networks andmaintain work and service in organizations that reject and vilify them. To effect achange from within is a mammoth task – it is hard enough to survive andmaintain faith.In some denominations, progress has been made in achieving inclusivenessthrough affirmation. Churches have declared themselves affirmingtowards LGBTQ members and are put forward as appropriate FBO to offer non-discriminatory fellowship and service to the broader community. The UnitingChurch in Australia is such a broadly affirming church that theoretically welcomesLGBTQ people. However, this extends neither to all individuals nor to wholestates, such as Queensland, which rejects gay leadership and same-sex marriage.Especially in the north of Queensland, churches tend to reject and vilify LGBTQpeople, despite secular laws which prohibit this, and despite an overall affirmatorydeclaration from the whole church.6.1. Leadership and resilienceThe CASCADE NET will focus on community agency in adaptation to extremeweather events seeks to identify capacity for resilience in the community, in thiscase, a minority vulnerable community. Disasters are mostly short duration eventsthat must be structured by emergency managers to lose minority and culturalblindness in order to encompass and serve all members of the communityaccording to their needs. This requirement for emergency management as a stateorganization is relatively straightforward and is backed up by legislation, but it willstill take some time to achieve effective inclusivity. All of the scholarly articles thathave been reviewed in this paper contain sound recommendations concerningtraining, minority and specifically LGBTQ awareness, inclusive language andimagery, cooperation and resilience building. Many countries and jurisdictions areacknowledged as possessing appropriate policies, but these are often not practicedfully or even at all by some operational agencies (Duckworth 2022). To tackle thisgap between intention and practice, Duckworth outlines a mechanism for a radicaltransparency to build trust between minority communities and relief agencies.Hearing Minority Voices: Institutional Discrimination Towards LGBTQ in Disaster and Recovery2241005-15J. of Extr. Even. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY on 12/20/22. Re-use and distribution is strictly not permitted, except for Open Access articles.Apart from being victims of discrimination, LGBTQ people, coming from avery diverse minority are also leaders, careers, and innovators. Gorman-Murrayet al. (2019: 4) state the “remarkable resilience, social capital, and adaptive ca-pacity within LGBTQ communities”. Pre-existing networks and support structuresexist within LGBTQ communities. These must be sought and activated duringtimes of crisis and disaster. Stukes (2014), Dominey-Howes et al. (2014), and Grantet al. (2021) draw attention to the strength of leadership and resilience that existsamong LGBTQpeople and their communities. This also exists within strong affirmingand supportive, predominantly straight, extended families in their love and protectionof their own LGBTQ members. Equally important are the leadership roles played bymany LGBTQ people in mainstream society, who will be part of the response andrecovery of the wider communities in which they serve. There are, for example,lesbian and gay emergency managers who primarily serve the whole community, andwhose attitudes influence the agenda of tolerance. Dominey-Howes et al. (2014) andGaillard et al. (2017) refer to specific minority groups within LGBTQ in Asiancountries, who play key roles of leadership in disaster recovery. The leadership andresilience exist with the LGBTQ minority to advance change in DRR policy andpractice from within the agencies, even in tackling the conservatism of FBOs.The much greater problem is the entrusting of leadership of disaster relief, theoperation of evacuation centers and provision of welfare support services to FBOthat are blatantly anti-LGBTQ, and who consider it acceptable to deny the serviceswith which they have been entrusted by the government. Clearly, there are manyFBO who do good work, as cited by Ng (2015) in China, but there are funda-mentalist organizations which condemn LGBTQ people and refuse services andsupport. If these services and goods are provided by government through theseorganizations, such actions are illegal, but in many instances goods and servicesare provided by the charity of organizations that are only loosely answerable to thegovernment. Some of these organizations may be controlled and structured bygood governance, but in times of disaster, services are often provided by volunteerswhose training and awareness may be very limited, and some of whose anti-LGBTQ opinions are entrenched. LGBTQ people on the inside of these organi-zations have direct experience of the prejudice and intolerance that is directedtowards them. Many are active in refusing to walk away from that prejudice anddiscrimination (QCF 2021), and understand fully the depth of the problems in-volved in dealing with these FBO. Reversing the intolerance of evangelical FBOtowards LGBTQ people may not be achievable even in the long term, given itscenturies’ old history. Training in tolerance and inclusivity is not a solution toentrenched prejudice. An immediate focus must be the unsuitability of suchorganizations to be permitted to provide aid and relief after a disaster.D King2241005-16J. of Extr. Even.

ConclusionNew and emerging areas of research from a variety of disciplines such as An-thropology, Sociology, Gender and Feminist Studies, and Disaster Studies arguefor the importance of LGBTQ peoples’ needs and engagement in disaster responseand recovery. Researchers should identify discrimination and call out those orga-nizations, or sections within them, which practice discrimination and speak pub-licly against LGBTQ individuals and communities both outside the period of adisaster event but especially during a disaster impact and recovery (Stukes 2014).More research is needed to fully understand how those inside these FBO can workwithin disaster relief operations and recovery in a way that does not impinge on therights of LGBTQ members of the community during times of disaster and re-covery. Participatory action research informed by queer theory is a researchstrategy for working inside organizations and communities (Castan Broto 2021;Parkinson et al. 2018). The question to be addressed will be whether FBO whichadvocate or practice discrimination should be identified and removed from disasterrelief operations even if they have a long history of successful and effective reliefand recovery strategies. LGBTQ researchers within such organizations have acritical role and responsibility in enacting transformation that may harness thegoodwill and capacity of FBO to care for all members of the impacted community.ReferencesAger, J, Fiddian-Qasmiyeh E and Ager A (2015).

    "abstract": "Within the themes of CASCADE NET, this paper focusses on less heard voices and the need to develop new social spaces. Disaster vulnerability identifies diversity in society through a lens of constraints to solutions, on such bases as demography, socio-economic status, cultural, ethnic and gendered minorities within society, and marginalized groups as well as physical proximity to a hazard. The focus of disaster risk reduction is on building resilience through the strengths and capacities in society, but it has a tendency to homogenize characteristics of resilience to the community level, thereby flattening and hiding diversity. LGBTQ people are largely ignored as minority groups with specific information needs. Specific response and recovery processes and actors exacerbate the vulnerability of the LGBTQ minority, especially in evacuation, support, counselling, and rehousing. The role of faith-based organizations (FBO) in providing these services during disaster relief and recovery is examined in this paper. This paper identifies and critiques the attitudes and practices of some FBO towards LGBTQ groups in their provision of disaster relief services",
