As a result of work done by the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission, private law firms, and a coalition ofcivil rights groups, in November 2004, the lawsuit settled with A&Fagreeing: (1) to pay $50 million dollars in damages and fees; and (2) toimplement a variety of measures designed to diversify its workforce and toend the company's discriminatory practices.5' Professor of Law, Duke University School of Law.

In 1963, policies likeAbercrombie & Fitch's were prevalent in the United States, and employerswere free to exclude women and people of color from employmentopportunities at will.6 Indeed, people of color and women were discouragedfrom even applying for employment in some sectors of the economy due tothe ubiquitous presence of employment ads, often found in classified sectionsof newspapers, seeking individuals of a specific race or gender.7This state of affairs changed on July 2, 1964, when in the midst ofFreedom Summer8 and at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, the U.S.Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (CRA of 1964). If Brown v.Board of Education9 had removed the first pillar in the fortress of Jim Crow 10by invalidating the doctrine of separate but equal, then the CRA augured itsultimate destruction. The civil rights legislation was hard won, requiring thecourageous efforts of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, Dr. Martin LutherKing, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NationalWomen's Party, and countless other organizations and individuals whosesacrifice should not be forgotten. The Act passed after three contentiousmonths of debate in the U.S. Senate, including a 54-day filibuster, and withsizable opposition from southern representatives who feared the effects ofracial integration.\" This fear was illustrated in U.S. Senator RichardRussell's (GA) infamous statement that \"[w]e will resist to the bitter end anymeasure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social6 H.R.

This is the worst civil rights packageever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of theReconstruction proposals and actions of the radicalRepublican Congress.' 3At the time of its enactment, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was themost comprehensive piece of civil rights legislation in U.S. history. The Actwas wide-ranging, prohibiting discrimination in voting, publicaccommodations, public facilities, education, employment, and federallyassisted programs. A centerpiece of this landmark legislation was Title VII,14which bars discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion,sex, and national origin. 5Over the years, Title VII has been, in some ways, interpreted broadlyby the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet, in many respects, interpretations of thestatute have not kept pace with the changing nature of discrimination in themodem workplace. This essay examines the evolution of Title VII and threecontemporary challenges to U.S. employment discrimination law. Part Ibriefly describes several ways in which the statute has been expanded. PartII then turns to three issues that underscore conceptual limitations with recentinterpretations of Title VII and with U.S. anti-discrimination law moregenerally: (1) sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination; (2)implicit bias, structural discrimination, and the requirement of intent; and (3)formalism. Examination of these matters demonstrates how U.S. courts haveaddressed three highly contested issues with which all legal systems mustcontend: (1) what constitutes discrimination; (2) upon what basis does onedetermine which classes or groups are protected; and (3) what are the ultimategoals of anti-discrimination law. I conclude that although there has beenprogress, recent cases touching upon these issues pose considerable12Id.13 1963 Year in Review: Civil Rights Bill, UNITED PRESS INT'L, available athttp://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of- 1963/Civil-Rights-Bill!

TITLE VII's EXPANSIONTitle VII forms the heart of U.S. employment discrimination law. Thestatute bars intentional discrimination targeted at specific individuals andgroups' 6 as well as the use of neutral criteria that disparately affect protectedgroups. 17 For example, Title VII would render illegal a city's refusal topromote a woman to police chief if that refusal were based upon a belief thatpolice officers will not follow or respect a female chief.'8 Title VII wouldalso prohibit a policy requiring that police officers possess a four-year collegedegree (i.e., a neutral criterion that might produce a disparate impact on racialminorities) unless the police department can show that having advancededucational credentials is necessary to perform the job. 19Over the years, Title VII has been, in some ways, interpretedexpansively by the U.S. Supreme Court to cover forms of discrimination thatmay not have been anticipated by or within the contemplation of Congress atthe time the CRA of 1964 was enacted. For example, Title VII's prohibitionagainst sex discrimination initially focused on the wholesale exclusion ofwomen from the workplace or their segregation within certain occupations. 20Title VII challenged those who believed that a woman's place was solely inthe home or that women could be teachers, librarians, nurses, and waitresses,but not police officers, firefighters, doctors, lawyers, and mechanics. As TitleVII opened up employment spaces that were previously off limits to womenand people of color, second generation discrimination emerged,2' includingsexual and racial harassment and more nuanced forms of racial and genderstereotyping. Thus, while women and people of color were allowed intopreviously segregated spaces, once there they were frequently subject to16 See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a) (2013); McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411 U.S. 792(1973) (establishing the initial framework for proving cases of disparate treatmentor intentional discrimination based on circumstantial evidence).'7 See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(b) and 2000e-2(k) (2013); Griggs v.

(examining internal workplace structures and norms that serveto exclude women and people of color).[Vol. 6Title VII at 50hostile and abusive treatment, denied opportunities for advancement, andrequired to perform their race or gender in certain prescribed ways.Fortunately, due to the groundbreaking work of scholars likeCatharine MacKinnon, \"sex\" in Title VII has been read to includeprohibitions against sexual harassment 22 and to embrace, to some extent,gender stereotyping.23 Thus, not only are women no longer automaticallyexcluded from certain workplaces, they are also no longer forced to suffer(without some legal recourse) the indignity of unwelcome sexual demands atwork or to endure workplaces permeated with sexually demeaning languageand images. In addition, confident and assertive women need not fear thatthey will be told to \"walk more femininely, talk more femininely, and enrollin charm school\" 24 in order to be considered for promotion. This is not to saythat women are no longer subject to discriminatory workplace restrictionsand hostility. They are. The above interventions, however, have enabled morewomen to seek redress in these circumstances.In addition to arguing for a broad interpretation of \"sex\" under TitleVII, since 1964 U.S. scholars have also pressed the courts to acknowledgeand to accept that individuals may be subject to discrimination on multiplebases. For example, an employer may treat an Asian woman differently froma White woman or an Asian man because the Asian woman is both a womanand a person of color. Thus, she may be subject to stereotypes to which Whitewomen and Asian men are immune. 25 Prominent U.S. legal scholars such as22 See CATHARINE A. MACKINNON, SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF WORKING WOMEN:A CASE OF SEX DISCRIMINATION (Yale Univ. 1979). See also Menitor Sav. Bankv. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986) (recognizing quid pro quo and hostile environmentsexual harassment claims).23 See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (recognizing claim basedon gender stereotyping).241 d. at 235 (recognizing claim of a woman who was told that her chances of beingpromoted to partnership would increase if she would \"take a course at charmschool\" and \"walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely,wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry\").25 For example, Asian women are sometimes stereotyped as \"passive, repressed,naYve lotus blossoms; sexually exotic or seductively mysterious geisha; or deviousand wicked dragon ladies.\" Neither Asian men nor White women are generallysubject to these stereotypes.

REV. 771 (1996)).2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law ReviewKimberld Crenshaw and Angela Harris 26 have argued persuasively that suchintersectional claims ought to be acknowledged. Still other scholars haveurged courts to consider the ways in which persons are differently situatedwithin protected categories and how intra-group differences, like skin coloror various identity performances, may be used to harm subsets of workers.Thus, employers who hire African Americans but prefer lighter-tonedAfrican Americans over darker-toned African Americans may find theirdecision-making subject to challenge under Title VII's prohibition againstcolor discrimination. 27 Similarly, employers who prefer people of color whoconsciously or subconsciously cloak or downplay their racial identity asopposed to highlighting it, or women who embrace conventional notions offemininity as opposed to those who reject such notions, may also findthemselves on the wrong end of a lawsuit. 28 All of these claims, 29 and26 See Kimberld Crenshaw, Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, IdentityPolitics, and Violence Against Women of Color, 43 STAN. L. REV. 1241 (1991);Angela Harris, Race and Essentialism in Feminist Legal Theory, 42 STAN. L. REV.581 (1990).27 See Trina Jones, Shades ofBrown: The Law of Skin Color, 49 DUKE L.

CARBADO & MITU GULATI, ACTING WHITE?:RETHINKING RACE IN POST-RACIAL AMERICA (2013); KENJI YOSHINO,COVERING: THE HIDDEN ASSAULT ON OUR CIVIL RIGHTS (2006). Thus, employersmay prefer African Americans with racial performances more similar to that ofPresident Obama than that of Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson. Indeed, Senator HarryReid and Vice President (then Senator) Joe Biden's observations about PresidentObama's appeal during the 2008 Democratic primaries lend support to the salienceof identity performance. Few will forget Biden's statement, \"I mean, you got thefirst mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and anice-looking guy... I mean, that's a storybook, man\" or Senator Reid's observationthat the United States was ready to embrace a Black presidential candidate,especially Obama who was a \"light-skinned\" African American \"with no Negrodialect, unless he wanted to have one.\" JOHN HEILEMANN & MARK HALPERIN,GAME CHANGE: OBAMA AND THE CLINTONS, MCCAIN AND PALIN, AND THE RACEOF A LIFETIME 36 (2010) (recording Reid's comments); Jason Horowitz, BidenUnbound: Lays into Clinton, Obama, Edwards, N.Y. OBSERVER (Feb. 5, 2007,12:00 AM), http://observer.com/2007/02/biden-unbound-lays-into-clinton-obama-edwards (documenting Biden's comments).29 As noted earlier, even in areas where Title VII has been interpreted broadly,there has been pushback. Harassing practices that many women find hostile andoffensive are still too commonly viewed by men as appropriate. See Gary Langer,[Vol. 6Title VII at 50employment discrimination lawsuits in general,3\" are incredibly difficult forplaintiffs to win. These theoretical developments in U.S. anti-discriminationlaw are nonetheless important because they reflect a recognition, on somelevel, of both the complexity of social identities and the nuanced ways inwhich discrimination occurs.Although Title VII's development has been slow, and not necessarilylinear, the statute, coupled with the Equal Pay Act,3 ' the PregnancyOne in Four U.S. Women Reports Workplace Harassment, ABCNEWS.GO.COM(Nov. 16, 2011), http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/201 1/1 1/one-in-four-u-s-women-reports-workplace-harassment/. Plaintiffs who assert intersectional claimsbased upon multiple factors are likely to be accused of whining. And proving intra-group claims will likely be difficult as employers may successfully argue that theyare not discriminating, for example, on the basis of race if they hire some AfricanAmericans (even if those who are hired have a preferred skin tone or racialperformance). For additional examination of these issues, see Trina Jones, Intra-group Preferencing: Proving Skin Color and Identity Performance Discrimination,34 N.Y.U. REV. L. & SOC. CHANGE 657 (2010) (examining difficulties faced byplaintiffs alleging intra-group discrimination). However, with at least a doctrinalbasis for bringing these claims, one hopes and expects that over time material andnormative changes will occur.30 A voluminous literature documents both plaintiffs' low success rates in thesecases and explores possible reasons for these outcomes. See, e.g., Kevin M.Clermont & Stewart J. Schwab, How Employment Discrimination Plaintiffs Fare inFederal Court, 1 J.

Thesestatutory interventions, and the normative shifts to which they havecontributed, have led to workplaces and employment standards that look verydifferent from what U.S. workers experienced five decades ago. In 1960, 37.7percent of women participated in the U.S. labor force.34 In 2012, that numberhad risen to 57.7 percent. 35 In addition, the percentage of doctors, lawyers,accountants, professors, U.S. senators, representatives, governors, andForbes 500 CEOs who are female has increased significantly. In 1960, nearlytwo-thirds of women in the U.S. workforce held clerical, service, or salespositions and only 13 percent held professional positions.36 In 2010, 40.6percent of employed women held managerial and professional positions.37 Inaddition, in 1963, women earned 59 cents 38 on the dollar compared to what aWhite man earned. Today, that figure is about 80 cents.39The above advances are critically important as employment isessential to the economic well-being and dignity of employees and theirfamilies. Yet, considerable obstacles remain to equality of opportunity.Indeed, the glass and marble ceilings have yet to shatter. Although morewomen are in managerial and professional positions than in the past, they arestill underrepresented in the highest echelons of business. 40 Moreover, racial32 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(k) (2013).33 29 U.S.C. ยง 2601 (2013).34 NATIONAL EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE, Fifty Years After the Equal Pay Act:Assessing the Past, Taking Stock of the Future 10 (June 2013).35 UNITED STATES DEP'T OF LABOR, BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, Women ofWorking Age, available at http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/recentfacts.htm#rates.36 NATIONAL EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE, supra note 34, at 6.37 UNITED STATES DEP'T OF LABOR, WOMEN'S BUREAU, Women in the LaborForce in 2010, available at http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/Qf-laborforce-10.htm.38 NATIONAL EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE, supra note 34, at 6.39 UNITED STATES DEP'T OF LABOR, BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS, Women'sEarnings as a Percent of Men's in 2012, available athttp://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_201201 10.htm.

For example, while 34.8percent of employed White men hold managerial or professional positions,the same is true for only 15.3 percent of employed Latino men and 23.5percent of employed Black men.41 The percentages by race of employedworkers in managerial or professional positions are similarly stratified forwomen: 41.5 percent of White women compared to 24.1 percent of Latinawomen and 33.8 percent of Black women.42 The unemployment rate ofAfrican Americans has also been consistently double that of Whites.43ii.

This Partexamines three areas that highlight ways in which that law has lagged: (1)LGBTQ 44 rights; (2) implicit bias, structural discrimination, and therequirement of intent; and (3) formalism. It then briefly considers why U.S.anti-discrimination law has, in some areas, seemingly reached a standstill.A. Sexual Orientation and Gender IdentityDespite substantial advocacy for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) persons, neither U.S. constitutional law norU.S. statutory law afford adequate protection to these individuals.45 In therealm of U.S. constitutional law, there has been incremental progress since1986, when the U.S. Supreme Court in Bowers v. Hardwick upheld theconstitutionality of a Georgia law that criminalized certain sexual actsbetween same-sex individuals. 46 In a 5-4 opinion, the Court stated that theU.S. Constitution conferred neither \"a right of privacy that extends tohomosexual sodomy\" nor a \"fundamental right to engage in homosexualsodomy.\" 47 In reaching this determination, the justices in the majorityobserved that they were not \"inclined to take a more expansive view of [theCourt's] authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the DueProcess Clause,\" noting that \"[t]he Court is most vulnerable and comesnearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional lawhaving little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of theConstitution.,484' Although I reference lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer personsthrough use of the acronym LGBTQ, it is important to note that the analysis hereinfocuses primarily on sexual orientation. Sexual orientation, in the simplest sense ofthe term, means the gender to whom a person is sexually and/or romanticallyattracted. Sexual orientation should not be confused with gender identity, whichbroadly refers to a person's internal sense of being male, female, or somewhereelse along a gendered continuum and the expressive activity or behavior that mayaccompany that person's sense of identity.4\" Although this essay focuses primarily on statutory protections in theemployment arena, it is important to keep trends elsewhere in the law in mind asthey may affect the development and scope of statutory protections. The analysisin this section is therefore not limited to Title VII and employment.46 Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986).47 1d. at 190-91.48 Id. at 194.[Vol. 6Title VII at 50In 2003, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this stance inLawrence v. Texas.49 In that case, the Court invalidated a Texas sodomy lawthat criminalized same-sex sexual activity. The Court noted:[this case] involve[s] two adults who, with full andmutual consent from each other, engaged in sexualpractices common to a homosexual lifestyle. Thepetitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.The State cannot demean their existence or control theirdestiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause givesthem the full right to engage in their conduct withoutintervention of the government. \"It is a promise of theConstitution that there is a realm of personal liberty whichthe government may not enter.\" The Texas statutefurthers no legitimate state interest which can justify itsintrusion into the personal and private life of theindividual.\"In 2013, the Supreme Court again decided a case involving the rightsof sexual minorities in United States v. Windsor.5 1 In that case, the Court49 Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003).5 Id. at 578 (internal citations omitted). In a sharp turnaround from Bowers, theCourt recognized that constitutional principles are not fixed, but rather evolve,observing:[those] who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of theFifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment ... knewtimes can blind us to certain truths and later generations cansee that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serveonly to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in everygeneration can invoke its principles in their own search forgreater freedom.Id.51 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013). In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court also decidedHollingsworth v. Perry, a case challenging a ballot initiative (Proposition 8) whichprovided that only marriages between a man and a woman would be valid andrecognized in California. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652 (2013). In Perry,the lower courts had found Proposition 8 to be illegal. The Supreme Court declinedto decide the case on its merits, finding that the parties who were appealing thelower court rulings lacked \"standing\" to pursue the case before the Supreme Court.The effect of the Court's ruling was to reinstate the lower courts' determinationsthat Proposition 8 was invalid.2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Reviewconsidered key provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a federalstatute that defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman and, ineffect, rendered same-sex couples ineligible for certain federal benefits. Ininvalidating parts of DOMA, the Court determined thatthe principal purpose and the necessary effect of this laware to demean those persons who are in a lawful same-sexmarriage. This requires the Court to hold, as it now does,that DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of theliberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment ofthe Constitution.52Importantly, in Windsor, instead of banning all state-imposed prohibitions onsame-sex marriage, the Court merely extended protection to those same-sexcouples whose marriages were legal under their state's laws. Thus, the Courtdeclined to address whether a constitutional right to same-sex marriageexisted, leaving that issue for another day.That day came on June 26, 2015, when, in one of the most positivedevelopments for the rights of sexual minorities to date, the U.S. SupremeCourt announced its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. 3 In Obergefell, theSixth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld Ohio's prohibition against same-sex marriage, thus creating a split in the circuit courts regarding the power ofstates to ban same-sex marriages (and to refuse recognition of same-sexmarriages performed elsewhere). 4 On review, the Supreme Court found such52 Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2696. The Court also noted that \"the liberty protected bythe Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibitionagainst denying to any person the equal protection of the law.\" Id.51 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015). Before Obergefell, the Supreme Court declined toconsider a number of cases that would have offered the Court an opportunity toclarify the legal status of same-sex marriage. See, e.g., Schaefer v. Bostic, 760 F.3d352 (4th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 308 (2014) (declining to hear a FourthCircuit decision supporting marriage equality in Virginia); Bogan v. Baskin, 766F.3d 648 (7th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 316 (2014) (declining to hear aSeventh Circuit decision supporting marriage equality); Herbert v. Kitchen, 755F.3d 1193 (10th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 265 (2014) (declining to hear aTenth Circuit decision supporting marriage equality).14 The Court granted certiorari in three other cases decided by the Sixth Circuitwhich raised the same legal issues: Tanco v. Haslam, 135 S. Ct. 1040 (involving aTennessee ban); Deboer v. Synder, 135 S. Ct. 1040 (involving a Michigan ban);and Bourke v. Beshear, 135 S. Ct. 1041 (involving a Kentucky ban). The Courtconsolidated the four cases and limited its review to the following questions: (1)\"Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a state to license a marriage betweentwo people of the same sex?\" and (2) \"Does the Fourteenth Amendment require a[Vol. 6Title VII at 50bans unconstitutional and also held that states may not refuse to recognizesame-sex marriages performed in other states. 55 The Court noted:... the challenged laws burden the liberty of same-sex couples, and it must be further acknowledged thatthey abridge central precepts of equality. Here themarriage laws enforced by the respondents are in essenceunequal: same-sex couples are denied all the benefitsafforded to opposite-sex couples and are barred fromexercising a fundamental right. Especially against a longhistory of disapproval of their relationships, this denial tosame-sex couples of the right to marry works a grave andcontinuing harm. The imposition of this disability on gaysand lesbians serves to disrespect and subordinate them....These considerations lead to the conclusion that theright to marry is a fundamental right inherent in theliberty of the person, and under the Due Process andEqual Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendmentcouples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that rightand that liberty.56While Lawrence, Windsor, and Obergefell were significant stepsforward and were heralded by civil rights advocates, they do not extend thesame protection to LGBTQ persons that U.S. constitutional law offers othergroups. As things currently stand, the Court has never found sexualorientation (or gender identity) to be a suspect or a quasi-suspectclassification, which would subject distinctions on this basis to the highestlevel of constitutional review or at least intermediate review. Under strictscrutiny, the most demanding level of review, a governmental classificationmust serve a compelling state interest and the means employed to achievestate to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when theirmarriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state?\" See Obergefell v.Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2593 (2015).51 135 S. Ct. at 2605, 2607-08.56 135 S. Ct. at 2604. The Court articulated four reasons why marriage is afundamental right and noted that these reasons apply with equal force to same-sexand opposite-sex couples: (1) the \"right to personal choice regarding marriage isinherent in the concept of individual liberty;\" (2) the right to marry \"supports atwo-person union unlike any other in its importance to the committed individuals;\"(3) marriage \"safeguards children and families;\" and (4) marriage is a \"keystone ofour social order.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2599-2602.2014]58 Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Reviewthat interest must be narrowly tailored.57 Under intermediate scrutiny, thechallenged decision must further an important governmental interest andutilize means that are substantially related to that interest. 58 Instead ofemploying strict or intermediate scrutiny in Lawrence and Windsor, the Courtapplied a sort of \"heightened\" rational basis level of review (the lowest levelof review with a bit of added bite). Under that standard, the governmentmerely has to set forth a rational basis for its decision to treat a class ofcitizens differently, which in Lawrence and Windsor it could not do.59In Obergefell, while the Court found that state bans on same-sexmarriage violate both due process and equal protection principles secured bythe Fourteenth Amendment, the Court did not clearly set forth the governingstandard or framework that it employed in reaching this result. In other words,it did not clarify what level of scrutiny applies to decisions based on sexualidentity.60 In addition, the opinion is narrowly focused on marriage equalityand does not address the pervasive and ongoing discrimination that LGBTQpersons continue to face in other areas.These omissions are important because, without protected classstatus, LGBTQ persons remain vulnerable to discriminatory actions bygovernmental actors (particularly at the state level) in a variety of settings,including employment, interactions with the criminal justice system, and theprovision of goods and services. 61 To be sure, the Court is making progressin the area of LGBTQ rights. But, like the Court's \"with all deliberate speed\"approach in the second Brown v. Board of Education decision, 62 the present51 Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2716-17 (Alito, J., dissenting) (citing Parents Involved inCmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 201, 720 (2007)).58 Id.

See 135S.

Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954) (holding that[Vol. 6Title VII at 50Court has, at least until Obergefell, seemed satisfied taking an incrementalapproach regarding the constitutional rights of LGBTQ persons.63On the statutory front, the rights of LGBTQ persons also continue tobe inadequately protected. Strong arguments can be made that discriminationagainst lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals 64 on the basis of sexualorientation is a form of normative gender stereotyping (e.g., men should notlove men) and is per se based on sex (e.g., a woman who loves a man is notpenalized in the same way as a man who loves a man).65 Yet, U.S. courtshave not generally included discrimination on the basis of sexual orientationwithin Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination. 66 Courts have reliedsegregation in public education violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights);Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551-52 (1896) (upholding a Louisiana statutemandating separate railway cars for Whites and Blacks). However, a year later, inBrown II, the Court stated that implementation of a remedial plan for theconstitutional violation it had recognized in Brown I should occur \"with alldeliberate speed\"-rather than immediately-given the need to deal with variedlocal conditions. Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 300-01 (1955).63 To be sure, there may be advantages to this approach. Changes in public opinionand the trend in the lower courts in favor of sexual equality may have influencedthe Court's ruling in Obergefell. Interestingly, in Obergefell, Justice Kennedy mayhave signaled that the time for \"all deliberate speed\" was over with regard to therights of LGBTQ persons. In response to the Sixth Circuit's argument that it wouldbe \"appropriate ... to await further public discussion and political measures beforelicensing same-sex marriage,\" Justice Kennedy notes that \"there has been far moredeliberation than this argument acknowledges.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2605. He goes on topoint out that \"when the rights of persons are violated, 'the Constitution requiresredress by the courts,' notwithstanding the more general value of democraticdecisiomaking... This holds true even when protecting individual rights affectsissues of the utmost importance and sensitivity.\" Id.; but see 135 S.

This lack of statutory protection for LGBTQpersons exists despite the efforts of gay rights advocates and despite theincreasing acceptance of LGBTQ persons by non-LGBTQ Americans,particularly younger Americans. 7167 See, e.g., Ulane v.

For example in July 2014, President Obama signed Executive Order13672, which amends previous executive orders and prohibits discriminationon the basis of gender identity as well as sexual orientation. 72 In December2014, the Department of Justice announced that its position in future litigationwould be that \"Title VII ... extends to claims of discrimination based on anindividual's gender identity, including transgender status. ' 73 And, in July2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) took a majorstep forward in protecting the rights of LGBTQ persons by ruling thatdiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of sexdiscrimination under Title VII. 74 In Baldwin v. Department ofTransportation, the EEOC found that \"sexual orientation is inherently a 'sex-based consideration,' and an allegation of discrimination based on sexualorientation is necessarily an allegation of sex discrimination under Titlelegalize-gay-marriage-states.aspx (examining opinion poll data acrossdemographic groups).72 See News Release, The White House, Executive Order-Further Amendments toExecutive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the FederalGovernment, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity,available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/21/executive-order-further-amendments-executive-order- 1478-equal-employmen.73 This was a reversal from a position that the DOJ had taken in 2006.

The EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) had already taken the position thatTitle VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of transgender identity. The EEOChad also previously stated that discrimination against lesbian, gay, and bisexualworkers based on sex stereotypes (e.g., beliefs that men should love only womenor that women should love only men) is a form of sex discrimination under TitleVII.

However, the lack of explicitstatutory protection under Title VII (or a statute like ENDA) and the absenceof protected class status for constitutional purposes leave LGBTQ persons7' Baldwin v. Dep't of Transp., EEOC Appeal No. 0120133080, at 6 (July 15,2015), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/decisions/0120133080.pdf.76 Id. at 14.77 Baldwin applies to federal employee claims as the case involved theCommission's review of a federal agency determination. The case was brought bya Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employee who alleged that he had beendiscriminated against because he was gay. After the FAA dismissed the complaint,the employee appealed to the EEOC. Id. at 1.78 To be sure, some courts may disagree based upon an absence of Congressionalintent. That is, some courts may read Congress' failure to pass ENDA as evidencethat Congress does not intend to prohibit discrimination based on sexualorientation in federal statutory law. See Bibby v. Phila. Coca Cola Bottling Co.,260 F.3d 257, 261 (3d Cir. 2001). Indeed, the weakest part of the EEOC'sreasoning in Baldwin is on this point. The Commission argues that \"the SupremeCourt has ruled that '[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significancebecause several equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction,including the inference that the existing legislation already incorporated the offeredchange.\"' Baldwin, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133080, at 13. The problem with thisreasoning is that this is not an area where Congress has failed to act by doingnothing. Congress considered ENDA and the Act's sponsors were unable tosecure enough votes to pass the legislation (although they came very close the lasttime around). This suggests that far from being neutral or agnostic on the issue,Congress (at least a Republican-controlled Congress) does not want to protectagainst discrimination based upon sexual orientation.[Vol. 6Title VII at 50vulnerable to discriminatory acts by state-level governmental employers andprivate employers. Importantly, an impediment for both constitutional andstatutory law appears to be a general reluctance to expand the number ofprotected classifications in U.S. anti-discrimination law.7 9 This reluctance isheightened by a belief among some policy makers that sexual orientation 80 isdifferent from race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Historically, U.S.courts have relied upon four factors as gatekeepers to protected status: (1)immutability; (2) visibility; (3) relevancy; and (4) a pervasive history ofdiscrimination. 81 Although the appropriateness of employing some of thesefactors has been persuasively challenged, their continued use demonstratesan unwillingness to depart from previous analytical models once thesemodels have become entrenched, and a reluctance to engage in the sort ofcontext-specific analysis required to root out various forms ofdiscrimination. 82 These factors may influence popular and judicialunderstandings of sexual orientation as many Americans still seem to believethat sexual orientation is not innate and others maintain that it does not haveto be rendered visible-thus, in their minds, differentiating sexual orientationfrom other protected classifications such as race and gender.The poverty of these arguments is readily apparent. For example, andas others have noted, immutability should be abandoned as a gatekeeper toprotected status. 83 To be sure, few would contest the unfairness of penalizingpersons for traits they cannot change. The immutability theory, however,implies that decisions based on mutable traits are somehow less perniciousand therefore merit less attention, presumably because groups can escapeharm by electing to change the trait. Yet, as Professor Kenji Yoshino hasobserved, \"Jews generally can change or conceal their religion, while blacks79 However, as the EEOC points out in Baldwin, treating sexual orientationdiscrimination as sex discrimination does not require an expansion of protectedcategories. Baldwin, EEOC Appeal No. 0120133080, at 14.8 Here, I focus only on sexual orientation to avoid conflating discrimination basedon sexual orientation and discrimination based on gender identity. See supra note44.81 Marcy Strauss, Reevaluating Suspect Classifications, 35 SEATTLE U. L.

This surely does not make anti-Semitic legislation more legitimate than racist legislation.58 4Even assuming arguendo that lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons couldchange their orientation, 81it does not follow that they should do so. Indeed,the suggestion that sexual minorities should change or hide their orientationto avoid discrimination violates what has been referred to as the \"newimmutability,\" a theoretical approach that would protect traits that \"societydeems too important to ask anyone to change,\"8 6 or to conceal.B. Implicit Bias, Structural Discrimination, and the Requirement ofIntentIn addition to failing to provide adequate protection for LGBTQpersons, U.S. anti-discrimination law has focused on proof of intent in orderto establish a discrimination claim. Yet, as U.S. society has come to embracean anti-discrimination norm (in theory), such proof is increasingly difficult tofind as individuals either cover their motives or are driven by subconsciousor implicit bias. 7 A focus on intent, and an approach that views84 Yoshino, supra note 83, at 505.8 Importantly, the majority in Obergefell seemed to accept that sexual orientationis immutable. 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2596 (2015) (noting \"[o]nly in more recent yearshave psychiatrists and others recognized that sexual orientation is both a normalexpression of human sexuality and immutable\"). Some within the scientific andbroader community, however, continue to challenge this conclusion. See, e.g.,David Masci, PEW RESEARCH CENTER, Americans Are Still Divided On WhyPeople Are Gay (Mar. 6, 2015), available at http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/03/06/americans-are-still-divided-on-why-people-are-gay/.86 Elizabeth F.

In short, theimmutability analysis misses the mark because the ability or inability of a group toavoid negative action reveals little about whether that action is legitimate andwhether a group merits protection. As the \"new immutability\" theorists posit, theimmutability analysis also ignores the costs of conversion, or changing one'sstatus. As Professor Yoshino notes, change or conversion may not be a real optionfor those who will see the loss associated with a change of status as greater thanthe gains from escaping discrimination. Yoshino, supra note 83, at 510. Thus, anysuggestion that LGBTQ persons should change or cover their identity, if that wereindeed possible, includes an implicit, perhaps unconscious, belief that their currentidentity lacks value or positive meaning, which is untrue.87 See generally MAHZARIN R. BANAJI & ANTHONY G.

In Hazehvood School District v. United States88 andInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 89 the Court allowedan inference of intentional discrimination to be drawn from such disparities.In Griggs v. Duke Power Company,90 the Court went even farther bydeclining to require that plaintiffs establish intent. In that case, the employerutilized a high school diploma requirement and intelligence tests thatproduced a disparate impact on racial minorities. In invalidating theserequirements, the Court observed that Title VII \"proscribes not only overtdiscrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory inoperation.\"91 Further, the Court stated that \"intent or absence ofdiscriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or testingmechanisms that operate as 'built-in headwinds' for minority groups and areunrelated to measuring job capability... Congress directed the thrust of theAct to the consequences of employment practices, not simply themotivation.\" 92 Thus, facially neutral criteria that produce a disparate impacton protected groups were prohibited if they were not job-related and were notconsistent with an employer's legitimate business needs.In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress cleared up any uncertaintyabout whether Title VII embraced disparate impact theory by adding specificlanguage to the statute codifying the theory.93 Yet, disparate impact claimsare still subject to question and debate. To be sure, the Supreme Court haslong held that a showing of impact alone is insufficient to establish aconstitutional violation.94 Thus, plaintiffs bringing equal protectionchallenges against state actors must offer additional proof to show intentionaldiscrimination. In recent years, however, members of the Court have(Justin D. Levinson & Robert J. Smith eds., 2012) (examining the impact ofimplicit biases in various areas of the law).88 433 U.S. 299 (1977).89 431 U.S. 324 (1977).90 401 U.S. 424 (1971).91 401 U.S. at 431-32.92 Id. at 432.93 42 U.S.C. sec. 2000e-2(k) (2013).94 Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976).2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Reviewdisplayed skepticism about whether Title VII's statutory inclusion ofdisparate impact theory can survive constitutional challenge.This point was made most clearly in the 2009 case of Ricci v.DeStefano.9 5 In that case, the city of New Haven, Connecticut, administereda test to determine who, among its firefighters, would be eligible forpromotion to the position of lieutenant or captain. 96 When the test produceda disparate impact on minority firefighters, the city threw out the results. 97Seventeen White firefighters and one Latino firefighter, all of whom hadpassed the test, then sued the city alleging that they had been subject tointentional discrimination because the city had relied upon race in decidingnot to utilize the test results.98 The city acknowledged in its defense that ithad tossed the test because of its impact on minority firefighters and becausethe city feared that, had it used the test, the city would have been subject to aclaim of disparate impact discrimination.99 Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court wascalled upon to resolve the question of whether an employer is liable underTitle VII's prohibition of intentional discrimination if the employer refusesto use the results of a screening device that produces a disparate impact on aprotected group. The Court, in a 5-4 split opinion, responded that an employerwould not be liable if it had a strong basis in evidence to believe that adisparate impact claim would be brought against it. 00 Because New Havenlacked such a basis, the Court found for the plaintiffs.' 0 ' Significantly, JusticeScalia wrote a separate concurring opinion in which he stated that the Court's\"resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day on which the Courtwill have to confront the question: Whether, or to what extent, are thedisparate-impact provisions of Title VII ... consistent with the Constitution'sguarantee of equal protection?\"'1 2 He noted that \"the war between disparateimpact and equal protection will be waged sooner or later, and it behooves usto begin thinking about how-and on what terms-to make peace betweenthem.\"' ยฐ3 Justice Scalia seems to believe that impact cases are95 557 U.S. 557 (2009).96 Id. at 562.97 Id.98 Id. at 563.99 Id. at 570....

Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.,'0 4 the Court, in another 5-4split opinion, seemed to breathe new air into disparate impact theory, as leastregarding claims under the federal Fair Housing Act. 105 Relying on the logicof Griggs and other Title VII cases, the Court recognized the continuingviability of disparate impact theory under the FHA. 10 6 The Court, however,placed a number of restrictions on its use, noting that disparate impact theorymay raise \"serious constitutional questions,' 0 7 for example, if \"liability wereimposed based solely on a showing of a statistical disparity.\"' 0 8 To guardagainst such concerns and to \"protect potential defendants against abusivedisparate-impact claims,\"'1 9 the Court held that a racial imbalance, withoutmore, would be insufficient to support a claim. 10 The Court instructed lowercourts to carefully scrutinize disparate impact claims in the early stages of alawsuit and to ensure that plaintiffs have established a causal connectionbetween the challenged practices and the identified disparate effects.\"' Inaddition, the Court stated that remedial orders should \"concentrate on theelimination of the offending practice\" through the use of \"race-neutralmeans\" should additional measures be required.' 12The above limitations came from the majority opinion. Writing indissent, Justice Alito echoed many of the sentiments set forth by the majorityand by Justice Scalia in Ricci.' 3 Relying on the statutory phrase \"because of'(which also appears in the main prohibition of Title VII), Justice Alito arguedthat a disparate impact alone cannot give rise to liability under the FairHousing Act.\"14 Justice Thomas, in a separate dissent, went even farther,chastising the majority for its reliance on Griggs v. Duke Power Company,104 135 S. Ct. 2507 (2015).105 135 S. Ct. 2513 (\"[t]he question presented for the Court's determination iswhether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act\").106 135 S.

The importance ofdisparate impact theory cannot be overstated. If employers in a policedepartment, automobile manufacturing facility, or construction company,among others, do not believe that women ought to be employed in theirorganizations, they are unlikely to post signs saying \"women need not apply\"or to express such sentiments in documents, emails, or texts. Even if theseemployers do not consciously desire to exclude women, they may beinfluenced by unconscious beliefs and biases-those shared ideas andattitudes about groups that are tacitly conveyed through our common historyand cultural heritage. In a world where many persons with animus againstcertain groups will hide their prejudice and employ sophisticated means tocloak it, or be unaware that it exists, statistical disparities are an effective wayto smoke out discreet or unconscious discriminators. Even if no conscious orunconscious motive exists, to the extent that a goal of anti-discrimination lawis to ensure the inclusion of groups that have too long suffered on theperiphery of opportunity by eliminating systems and structures that producegrossly unequal outcomes without apparent justification, then disparateimpact theory is necessary. Unfortunately, in the United States, a substantiveequality or results-oiented approach to opportunity seems to be at odds witha capitalist economic system that depends upon hierarchy, and appears to beantithetical to a social ideology founded on the American Dream and widelyheld beliefs that individuals control their own destinies more than, in fact,they do.C. FormalismThe reluctance to redress sexual orientation and gender identitydiscrimination fully and the apparent retreat from disparate impact theorypose considerable ongoing challenges for anti-discrimination advocates inthe United States. Yet, another problem has also emerged which hasconsiderable implications for corrective and distributive justice. Over the lastfifty years, U.S. anti-discrimination law has embraced a theory of formalequality, where the goal is to treat everyone (men and women, people of colorand whites, religious majorities and minorities) the same. Any deviation fromthis formalism appears to be immediately suspect.To be sure, a commitment to formal equality is a good starting pointand has led to some progress. Indeed, one could argue that formalismproduced the result in Obergefell v. Hodges (i.e., that same-sex marriage must\"' Id. at 2526 (Thomas, J., dissenting).[Vol. 6Title VII at 50be treated the same as opposite-sex marriage).1 16 Yet, formalism alone maybe insufficient. As the Supreme Court pointed out as early as Griggs v. DukePower Company, treating differently situated people the same does notnecessarily produce equality of opportunity or equity. 117 Unfortunately, forsome formal equality has become both the starting point and the ending pointof contemporary discrimination analyses, as demonstrated by Chief JusticeRoberts in a recent case in which the Court found that the use of race byschool districts seeking to integrate public schools was unlawful. In hisplurality opinion, Justice Roberts stated that \"[t]he way to stop discriminationon the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" 8 Inanother case, involving affirmative action, Justice Clarence Thomas took asimilarly formalistic view. In rejecting the use of race-based affirmativeaction measures, Justice Thomas stated that \"[i]n [his] mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxiousas discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice. In each instance, it is racialdiscrimination, plain and simple.\" ' 19 Thus, in the minds of these justices, notonly is the dissimilar treatment of racial groups per se unlawful, but thejustifications for such dissimilar treatment are (at least for Justice Thomas)seemingly irrelevant.Justice Stevens has pointed to limitations inherent in reasoning of thiskind. In Adarand, he noted:[t]he Court's concept of \"consistency\" assumes that thereis no significant difference between a decision by themajority to impose a special burden on the members of aminority race and a decision by the majority to provide abenefit to certain members of that minoritynotwithstanding its incidental burden on some membersof the majority. In my opinion that assumption isuntenable. There is no moral or constitutionalequivalence between a policy that is designed toperpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicateracial subordination. Invidious discrimination is anengine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group toenhance or maintain the power of the majority. Remedialrace-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a116 Obergefell v. Hodges is discussed supra at pages 12-13.\" 7 Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971).18 Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 748(2007).119 Adarand Constructors v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 240 (1995) (Thomas, J.,concurring).2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Reviewdesire to foster equality in society. No sensibleconception of the Government's constitutional obligationto \"govern impartially,\" should ignore this distinction.' 20The rigid adherence to formal equality, which is both ahistorical andacontextual, 121 has been used not only to thwart affirmative action measuresand measures designed to foster greater racial integration; it has also beenused to undermine initiatives that would lead to greater participation by120 Id. at 243 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Stevens went on to observe:The consistency that the Court espouses would disregard thedifference between a \"No Trespassing\" sign and a welcomemat. It would treat a Dixiecrat Senator's decision to voteagainst Thurgood Marshall's confirmation in order to keepAfrican Americans off the Supreme Court as on a par withPresident Johnson's evaluation of his nominee's race as apositive factor. It would equate a law that made black citizensineligible for military service with a program aimed atrecruiting black soldiers. An attempt by the majority to excludemembers of a minority race from a regulated market isfundamentally different from a subsidy that enables arelatively small group of newcomers to enter that market. Aninterest in \"consistency\" does not justify treating differences asthough they were similarities.Id. at 245.21 Justice Stevens has also pointed to the importance of contextual analysis. InParents Involved, he criticized Chief Justice Roberts' characterization of Brown v.Board of Education, noting:The first sentence in the concluding paragraph of [JusticeRoberts'] opinion states: \"Before Brown, schoolchildren weretold where they could and could not go to school based on thecolor of their skin.\" This sentence reminds me of AnatoleFrance's observation: \"[T]he majestic equality of the la[w],..โข forbid[s] rich and poor alike to sleep under the bridges, to begin the streets, and to steal their bread.\" The Chief Justice failsto note that it was only black schoolchildren who were soordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of whitechildren struggling to attend black schools. In this and otherways, The Chief Justice rewrites the history of one of thisCourt's most important decisions.Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 799 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (internal citationsomitted).[Vol. 6Title VII at 50women in the workforce. For example, a commitment to formalism has beenemployed to counter efforts to require that employers make necessaryadjustments for workers experiencing complications from pregnancy. 122 Thiswas demonstrated recently in Young v. United Parcel Service, a caseinvolving a UPS employee who requested a workplace accommodation inorder to avoid lifting heavy items during her pregnancy. 123 The employeraccommodated some nonpregnant workers with similar limitations, but notall such workers. In interpreting the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, whichamended Title VII to include pregnancy within the definition of sexdiscrimination, 24 the U.S. Supreme Court held that while Title VII requiresequal treatment (i.e., that employers accommodate pregnant women to theextent that they accommodate nonpregnant workers with similar restrictions),such accommodation is not required if the employer refuses to accommodatepregnant workers and some subgroup of nonpregnant workers fornondiscriminatory reasons.125 In other words, the statute did not require that122 See, e.g., Stout v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 282 F.3d 856 (5th Cir. 2002);Troupe v. May Dep't Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994); Marafino v. St.Louis Cty. Circuit Court, 707 F.2d 1005 (8th Cir. 1983); see also California Fed.Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Guerra, 479 U.S. 272, 284-89 (1987) (finding that Title VIIallows, but does not require, the preferential treatment of pregnant workers).123 135 S. Ct. 1338, 1344 (2015).124 The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) added section 701(k) to Title VII.See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, The PregnancyDiscrimination Act of 1978, available athttp://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm (discussing the PDA's history);Young v. United Parcel Serv., 135 S. Ct. at 1344-45 (same). Section 701(k) reads,in part:the terms 'because of sex' or 'on the basis of sex' include, butare not limited to, because of or on the basis of pregnancy,childbirth, or related medical conditions; and women affectedby pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions shall betreated the same for all employment-related purposes ... asother persons not so affected but similar in their ability orinability to work....42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(k). In Young, the Court was asked to interpret the second clauseof section 701(k) in a context where the employer accommodated many, but notall, workers with nonpregnancy-related disabilities. 135 U.S. at 1344. Thus, thequestion arose as to which \"other persons\" pregnant women were to be compared.125 Importantly, the Court also found that neutral justifications offered to explain afailure to accommodate pregnant women could be challenged, noting,[w]e believe that the plaintiff may reach a jury on this issue byproviding sufficient evidence that the employer's policies2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law Reviewpregnant women be afforded \"most favored nation status\" or that they betreated better than those nonpregnant workers who were notaccommodated. 126Oddly enough, formalism has produced other interesting claims inrecent years, including assertions by workers without children that they aresubject to discrimination-or a new form of parental status discrimination-because of the presence of family-friendly workplace policies (e.g.,alternative work arrangements, leave policies, and dependent-care and otherbenefits designed to appeal to parents). 127 In short, these workers are assertingthat they are being forced to work longer hours (e.g., overtime, holidays, andweekends) for less pay and fewer benefits than their colleagues with children,and that this violates the principle of equal treatment, or equal pay for equalwork.12 8 Significantly, only an overly formalistic and acontextual approachwould give these arguments any resonance.impose a significant burden on pregnant workers, and that theemployer's 'legitimate, nondiscriminatory' reasons are notsufficiently strong to justify the burden, but rather-whenconsidered along with the burden imposed-give rise to aninference of intentional discrimination.... The plaintiff cancreate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether asignificant burden exists by providing evidence that theemployer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnantworkers while failing to accommodate a large percentage ofpregnant workers.135 S. Ct. at 1354.126 Id. at 1349-50.127 Such policies would include part-time, flextime, and compressed work weeks;maternity, paternity, and other forms of family leave; and on-site childcare centers,vouchers to subsidize childcare costs, and tuition benefits, among other things.128 For additional discussion of parental status discrimination from the viewpoint ofchildfree persons, see TRINA JONES, Single and Childfree! Reassessing Parentaland Marital Status Discrimination, 46 ARIZ. ST. L.J. 1255 (2014). In short, I arguethat if one accepts anti-subordination as a key objective of anti-discrimination law,then merely treating childless workers differently from parents does not leadinexorably to the conclusion that discrimination is occurring. While the argumentof childless workers seems persuasive at first glance, one must evaluate thepurposes being served by the policies about which childless workers complainbefore advocating for their abolishment. To be sure, policies and practices based ongeneralized assumptions about the benefits of parenting should not gounchallenged. To the extent, however, that employer actions are implemented toeliminate the continued subordination and marginalization of women in theworkplace, they should be maintained. Practices that serve legitimate public ends[Vol. 6Title VII at 50In summary, the analysis in this section reveals that U.S. courts havedeveloped a rather limited understanding of discrimination and that doctrinalanalysis has, in some cases, veered dangerously off course. This essaymaintains that discrimination is not simply treating individuals differently.By the same token, equal opportunity may not be satisfied merely by treatingeveryone the same. One must always ask the additional question of whydissimilar treatment is occurring or is required. Asking this questionnecessarily invites an important and critical conversation about the goals ofanti-discrimination law-a discussion that involves corrective anddistributive justice. Unfortunately, on the fiftieth anniversary of the CRA, itis that conversation that many Americans, including some members of thejudiciary, seem no longer interested in having.D. Why Are We Here?In reflecting on the last fifty years, one might ask: why has U.S. anti-discrimination law lost much of its forward momentum, and what are possibleimplications for the future? A partial response to the first question may be theintractability of deeply-rooted norms, which include embedded beliefs aboutthe desirability and inherent capabilities of various groups. But part of theanswer may also be temporal. The United States is fifty years from a systemof de jure segregation and in-your-face discrimination. The passage of timerenders it more difficult for the U.S. public, whose median age is 37, to seeand to understand the ways in which modem discrimination happens.Arguments based on numerical disparities inevitably encounter America'ssocial ideology, which is based upon rugged individualism and the AmericanDream. The idea is that with individual effort anyone can pull herself up byher bootstraps and achieve economic prosperity. The fact that socio-economic mobility and the American Dream are largely unobtainable formasses of people is, of course, ignored or dismissed.Another related response to the question of why U.S. anti-discrimination law is at a standstill is that Americans want to believe that weare post-race, post-sex, and post-everything else. This is an understandableimpulse given this country's messy and extensive history of discrimination.It is simply more pleasant and easier all around to think that we are, or haveobtained, our better selves, than to continue the hard and challenging work ofgrappling with our continuing imperfections.may have adverse effects for subsets of workers (i.e., workers without children).These effects can be minimized by hiring additional workers, by making certainbenefits available to all workers, and by paying workers additional compensationor offering comparable time off when they are required to do extra work.2014]Alabama Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Law ReviewAnd finally, there is a question of power. Real inclusion-likeaccepting the browning of America-means that, inevitably, those with thestrongest hold on existing power structures will face competition and apotential diminution of their influence. History, not just in the U.S. but aroundthe world, has shown that power is rarely voluntarily relinquished. Moreover,power that is threatened, whether materially or psychologically, often strikesback.In this climate, \"discrimination fatigue,\" or an unwillingness to bereceptive to existing claims of discrimination or to an expansion of protectedclassifications, is understandable, though thoroughly unacceptable. Anembrace of formal equality, which has some value but does not go far enoughin bridging opportunity gaps, is also understandable, though ultimatelyinadequate.CONCLUSIONIn many ways, the U.S. workplace in 2015 is very different from theworkplace in 1964. Although Title VII has not eradicated all discrimination,it has affected employee demographics and influenced the ways in whichAmericans conceptualize the roles and capabilities of women and people ofcolor. For these reasons, Title VII and the legions of courageous plaintiffs,lawyers, policy makers, and other activists who worked tirelessly toimplement its promise deserve to be celebrated. Yet, Americans should becareful not to become blinded by celebratory zeal. While it is appropriate,and indeed desirable and encouraging, to look back and to acknowledge theslow and steady progress Title VII has produced, Americans must recognizethat there is still much work to be done before full equality of opportunity isrealized. As this essay has demonstrated, anti-discrimination advocates mustcontinue to struggle against those who would refuse to extend full legalcoverage to LGBTQ persons. They must resist the use of analyticaltechniques that fail to recognize the ways in which groups are differentlysituated and the discreet and subtle ways in which discrimination is practiced.Above all, they must continue to press for greater discussion and a morecomplex understanding of the differences between equality and equity, anddissimilar treatment and discrimination.[Vol. 6",
