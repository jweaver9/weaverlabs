This report represents the next iteration of work from Funders for LGBTQ Issues in our ongoing effort to document the scale of philanthropic support for LGBTQ communities and issues. In partnership with Strength in Numbers, an LGBTQ-led research firm with expertise in philanthropic strategy and evaluation, our team worked to adapt our research program to address the growth in the sector and the changes to how foundations are funding. Our new approach has been guided by a commitment to sustainability, transparency, and durability to develop consistent systems and methodologies that can grow with Funders for LGBTQ Issues and respond to the changing needs of the sector.  The changes we’ve made will enable us to more efficiently and systematically analyze the grant data, better detect funding trends over time, and pursue new and novel analyses. While we strove to maintain continuity with our established reporting methods and practices, this year’s report — the 18th edition in our Tracking Report Series — differs from our past model in ways that are worth highlighting. For starters, this is the first time in our Tracking Report Series that we are reporting on two years of grantmaking data in a single publication. The work we have done to ensure that the fund tracking process is sustainable and that we can better respond to the future research needs of the sector took time. As a result, we determined that a publication combining 2019 and 2020 data was our best option to provide timely data to the field. This report offers an overview of funding trends and highlights for calendar years 2019-2020, and presents a deeper analysis of 2020 data. In the methods INTRODUCTIONSince 2002, Funders for LGBTQ Issues has published an annual fund tracking report that aggregates giving to LGBTQ communities and issues from foundations, corporations, and funding institutions in the United States, which includes both domestic and global giving.   Funders for LGBTQ Issues has more than 85 partners in our network, with many more that directly submit data about their LGBTQ grantmaking. The LGBTQ funding sector has grown dramatically since the inception of our fund tracking work. Our first report in 2002 had fewer than 1,600 grants representing $30 million in LGBTQ funding; in 2020, we analyzed 5,707 grants representing over $200 million in LGBTQ funding.  The partnerships we have built with our members and other submitting donors, as well as the hard work of our research team, have culminated in publications that many in the field rely on for LGBTQ funding data.5Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundationssection, you can read more about new strategies we piloted to improve efficiency and accuracy of the grant coding process to address the increasingly unwieldy size — in both total funding and number of grants — of the annual data set of known grants awarded to LGBTQ communities and issues. There are several important analyses that we were not able to complete in this iteration of the report, including geographic distribution of funding. We anticipate returning to a detailed analysis by calendar year, and will also add more complex analyses in response to sector needs in future iterations of this report.The LGBTQ funding landscape is dominated by a set of foundations that are dedicated to this work and represent the majority of the funding for the sector. Funding from the top 10 foundations has consistently accounted for nearly two-thirds of all foundation support for LGBTQ communities and issues, according to our research. We have strong relationships with the majority of these funders and have been careful to include quality submissions from them in this report. However, we also want to acknowledge that this year’s report has fewer foundations represented than in previous years. The reason for having fewer foundations included is complicated and multifaceted–COVID-19 and cuts in resources for government systems resulted in delays in the availability of 990s and other public sources of grants data. At the same time, bandwidth for submitting and processing data has been impacted by the global pandemic, which affected us and our members and foundation supporters. Our priority in gathering data and producing these findings was to compile a purposeful data set representative of the vast majority of philanthropic support for LGBTQ communities and issues, and we believe we have achieved that goal. Finally, readers should remember that this report includes only funding from U.S.-based foundations and corporations, not from individuals or government agencies. This reminder feels particularly pertinent given the fast pace of change in our sector and beyond. The report begins with an overview of all funding for LGBTQ communities and issues, but the bulk of the report focuses on the approximately 80 percent of funding U.S. foundations awarded for activities in the United States. I encourage readers interested in the global LGBTQ funding landscape to consult the Global Resources Report, published by our close partners at the Global Philanthropy Project. Our team is proud to share this report with you and stands committed to continuing to improve this resource for the field in the coming years. It is our hope that this report will continue to serve as a tool for foundation staff, sector advocates, and movement partners in our shared mission to increase philanthropic resources to support LGBTQ organizations and movements.Sincerely, Andrew Wallace Vice President of Research & Communications, Funders for LGBTQ Issues6 2019-2020 RESOURCE TRACKING REPORTThis report describes United States-based foundation funding in support of LGTBQ communities and issues awarded in calendar years 2019-2020. In 2019, we documented 6,027 grants awarded by 186 foundations for a total of $193 million, excluding funds awarded for the purpose of regranting. In 2020, we found 5,707 grants awarded by 211 foundations for a total of $201 million, excluding funds awarded for the purpose of regranting. In both years, nearly 80 percent of U.S.-based foundation support for LGBTQ communities and issues was awarded for efforts in the United States, while the remaining 20 percent of funding supported efforts around the globe. We found that U.S.-based foundations awarded grants to 4,459 unique organizations in the United States and abroad.  This report describes a decrease in support compared to our 2018 findings and paints a complex picture of the state of foundation support for LGBTQ communities at a moment of continued turmoil and upheaval related to COVID-19 and escalating political unrest.As noted in the introduction, the number of foundations included in the 2019-2020 edition of the report is lower than in previous years and reflects the impact of delays in the availability of data from previously available sources, as well as the impacts of COVID-19 on all aspects of work in the sector. This difference in sample size should be kept in mind as you compare growth over time, and we should focus on broad trends rather than year-to-year comparisons. The field of LGBTQ funding continues to be driven by a small group of leading funders. In 2020, the top 10 funders of LGBTQ communities and issues in the United States accounted for 60 percent of all reported funding. If we were to extend this list to the top 20 donors, we would describe over 75 percent of all funding for LGBTQ communities in the U.S.Total Annual LGBTQ Grant Dollars, 2009-2020OVERVIEWTotal Annual LGBTQ Grant Dollars, 2009-2018Top 10 Funders of LGBTQ Issues, by Total Dollar Amount 2019-20201 Foundation funding for LGBTQ Issues from U.S. Foundations totaled $200.8 million in 2020, a slight increase over the $192.5 million reported in 2019.

Gilead Sciences, a corporate donor, once again increased investment and continues to hold the top spot on our list, a position it has held since 2018. In 2020, Gilead Sciences awarded $34.5 million in support of LGBTQ communities and issues.    Compared to overall giving by U.S. foundations, support directed to LGBTQ communities and issues remains small. For every $100 awarded by U.S. foundations in 2020, only 23 cents specifically supported LGBTQ issues.LGBTQ Funding by U.S. FoundationsTop Ten Funders By Total Dollar Amount, 2019-2020Top Grantmakers 2019-2020The field of LGBTQ funding continues to be driven by a small group of leading funders.

Sources of LGBTQ Funding 2019-2020Consistent with established trends, funding from private foundations accounted for the largest share of U.S. foundation support for LGBTQ communities and issues in 2019 and 2020. Support from private foundations decreased by 21 percent from 2018 to 2020, but still accounted for 36 percent of all funding for LGBTQ communities.  Support from public foundations grew between 2018-2020 to account for 27 percent of all funding in 2020. Public foundations were the second largest source of funding for LGBTQ communities.Giving from corporate foundations grew from the $37.7 million reported in 2018 to $42.2 million in 2020, accounting for 18 percent of all funding in 2020. This increase is largely driven by the growth of one funder, Gilead Sciences, which in 2020 was the top named funder of LGBTQ communities and issues.Funding from community foundations remained consistent at 5 percent of funding in 2020, and support from a single anonymous donor continued to grow, accounting for 15 percent of all funding in 2020.Sources of LGBTQ Funding by Funder Type (2019-2020)2019 20202019 2020PUBLICPRIVATE CORPORATECOMMUNITY ANONYMOUS40%23%19%4%14%36%27%18%5%15%Private $86,679,991 40% $83,211,335 36%Public $49,557,669 23% $63,109,519 27%Corporate $40,650,469 19% $42,236,719 18%Community $8,998,298 4% $10,737,813 5%Anonymous $30,955,700 14% $34,861,250 15%Total $216,807,127 $234,156,63613Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations*This table excludes funds awarded for the purpose of regranting.

In 2020, a single foundation, Gilead Sciences, accounted for 18 percent of total foundation support for U.S. LGBTQ communities and issues. The top ten largest funders (including Gilead Sciences) are responsible for over 60 percent of funding, and the top 20 funders accounted for more than 75 percent of all U.S. foundation support for LGBTQ communities and issues in the United States. *The total and the accompanying calculations on this page include the $23.9 million that U.S. foundations awarded for the sole purpose of regranting.

In 2019, $90.1 million, or 59 percent of all U.S.-based foundation support for LGBTQ communities and issues, was allocated to the general LGBTQ community. In 2020, this increased to $107.1 million,  or 68 percent of overall LGBTQ funding. While total foundation giving to LGBTQ communities in the United States has decreased from its record high in 2018, nominal giving to transgender communities has held steady, even reaching a record high of $36.1 million in 2019. However, this accounts for a very small amount of total foundation giving. For every $100 awarded by U.S. foundations, less than 5 cents supported transgender communities in both 2019 and 2020.

In 2019, $34.9 million, 23 percent of overall LGBTQ funding, was allocated to LGBTQ communities of color broadly. In 2020, this fell to $25.7 million, or 16 percent of overall LGBTQ funding.  There was a notable increase in funding for Black LGBTQ communities in 2020, reaching a record high of $18.7 million. This is a 71 percent increase from 2019, and may be reflective of philanthropic response to racial justice uprisings in 2020.However, funding for all other specific LGBTQ communities of color fell from 2019 to 2020.Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among People of Color Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among People of Color,  2019-2020*This table excludes funds awarded for the purpose of regranting. 2019 2020Black $10,963,303 7% $18,712,616 12%Latinx $4,136,840 3% $3,929,947 3%AAPI $953,368 1% $732,549 <1%Indigenous $1,135,912 1% $357,770 <1%Middle Eastern $56,174 <1% $1,000 <1%2019LATINXBLACK INDIGENOUSAAPI MIDDLE EASTERN202019Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. FoundationsFunding for LGBTQ children and youth, historically the most funded subpopulation, reached a new record high of $40.4 million in 2019. This was in large part driven by giving from Gilead Sciences, which accounted for more than 30 percent of total giving to LGBTQ children and youth. In 2020, total giving to LGBTQ children and youth dropped to $27.9 million, which is more in line with previous levels. Similarly, the high level of funding for homeless and marginally housed LGBTQ communities in 2019 can largely be attributed to $13.3 million from Gilead Sciences (56 percent of total giving to homeless and marginally housed LGBTQ communities). In 2020, total funding for marginally housed LGBTQ communities dropped by more than 50 percent from 2019, to $10.5 million (22 percent of which is from the top funder of this community, Gilead Sciences). From 2019 to 2020, there is also a decrease in funding to LGBTQ immigrants and refugees, and LGBTQ sex workers. However, funding to LGBTQ people of faith and LGBTQ older adults increased.Distribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among Other PopulationsDistribution of Domestic Grant Dollars Among Other Populations,  2019-2020*This table excludes funds awarded for the purpose of regranting. 2019 2020Children and Youth $40,415,356 27% $27,869,088 18%Homeless and Marginally  Housed People $23,569,514 16% $10,531,155 7%People of Faith $3,949,837 3% $7,567,408 5%Immigrants and Refugees $10,702,767 7% $6,724,860 4%Older Adults $3,453,658 2% $4,720,824 3%Sex Workers $3,598,549 2% $3,122,645 2%2019HOMELESS & MARGINALLY HOUSED PEOPLECHILDREN & YOUTH IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEESPEOPLE OF FAITHOLDER ADULTS SEX WORKERS202020 2019-2020 RESOURCE TRACKING REPORTDeeper Dive Analysis of 2020 Funding for LGBTQ Communities in the United StatesIn this section, we offer additional analysis of U.S. foundation support for LGTBQ communities and issues in the United States for the calendar year 2020. We anticipate returning to a detailed analysis by calendar year in future iterations of the report, adding more complex analysis as our work progresses.Funds awarded for work inside the United States were primarily directed to efforts at the national level, accounting for 42 percent of support for LGBTQ communities and issues in the United States, or $66.3 million in 2020. Activities at the local level received 23 percent, or $36 million, followed by efforts focused on the state level, which accounted for 14 percent of all funding. Percentages reported here are of the total grant dollars awarded in the U.S., including those for which geographic focus could not be ascertained.In previous reports, we found a higher percentage of grants focused on work at the local level. For this report, we only coded grants as local in focus if the geographic target was specified in the grant.

Funding to support strengthening communities, families, and visibility was the next most funded category. This issue area, encompassing a broad range of activities including community-building programs, pride celebrations, and visibility initiatives, accounted for 23 percent of all funding. Support for health and wellbeing closely followed, accounting for 21 percent of all domestic funding in 2020, up slightly from the 20 percent reported in 2018. Issues Addressed in Domestic Funding Distribution of Funding for U.S. LGBTQ Communities and Issues, by Issues Addressed (2020)12(12)  For 10 percent of grants, we were not able to identify an issue area through automated coding or manual review. Grants coded to multiple issues were weighted with the inverse of the number of issues to which they were coded; for example, if a grant was coded to economic issues and to education and safe schools (2 issues), each category included ½ (50%) of the funding for that grant. COVID funding is not included in this weighting; for example, if a grant was coded to economic issues, education and safe schools, and COVID, then economic issues and education and safe schools would each include ½ (50%) of the funding for that grant and COVID would receive 100% of funding for that grant.The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 had a profound impact on every aspect of society. Our analysis of U.S. foundation funding for LGTBQ communities and issues in 2020 found nearly $16 million in grantmaking — 10 percent of all reported grantmaking in our dataset — was related to COVID-19.

This support strategy includes funding for governmental advocacy, community organizing, public education efforts, and/or litigation to influence policy and/or the allocation of resources in support of LGBTQ communities. Following advocacy, support for direct services and health care received 18 percent of all support, nearly $30 million in funding in 2020.

The report does not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTQ people. The data were collected in three ways: foundations could submit grant-level information for each year using a template provided by Funders for LGBTQ Issues, grants could be found through a keyword search of a dataset of approximately 62,000 990 submissions for the years 2019 and 2020 (obtained from Open990), or grants could be identified using published annual reports. The dataset was deduplicated by funder name; in other words, if funders submitted directly, their grants were not included in searches of 990s or online searches.  Multi-year grants are counted in full in the year they were awarded. This method best reflects a foundation’s priorities in the year of reporting, though does contribute to fluctuations from year to year.Grants were included in the dataset if foundations indicated in the grant description (or by selecting LGBTQ population categories in the 2020 template) that they were awarded for the specific purpose of supporting LGBTQ communities or issues. Grants that lacked specificity in their grant description could also be included in the dataset if they were awarded to an organization whose mission was solely focused on LGBTQ communities or issues (methods for identifying these missions were slightly different in 2019 vs. 2020). Grants were assigned to LGBTQ populations (e.g. asexual, lesbian etc.), other populations (e.g. Black, youth), issues, and strategies using keyword searches of grant descriptions and grantee missions. Where keywords indicated that grants had multiple LGBTQ populations, multiple other populations, multiple issues, or multiple strategies, grant amounts were weighted by the inverse of the number of populations (or issues or strategies) the grant addressed. For details on how population, issue, and strategy weights were created, please contact the authors of the report. METHODOLOGY33Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations34 2019-2020 RESOURCE TRACKING REPORTThis project would not be possible without the participation of our members and other philanthropic entities who generously shared grantmaking data and other insights for this report. We are especially grateful to our colleagues at Funders Concerned About AIDS (FCAA) — in particular, Caterina Gironda and Sarah Hamilton — for sharing LGBTQ-specific HIV/AIDS grantmaking data and for consistently being outstanding collaborative partners in our research efforts. Our work has been strengthened through collaboration with the research team at Global Philanthropy Project. In particular, Ezra Nepon and Jay Postic have contributed invaluable support and feedback that has strengthened our shared mission to increase philanthropic support for LGBTQ communities around the globe. For this report, we benefited from 990 data provided by Open990. ACKNOWLEDGMENTSFunders for LGBTQ Issues works to increase the scale and impact of philanthropic resources aimed at enhancing the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities, promoting equity, and advancing racial, economic and gender justice.Rickke Mananzala  C H A I RExecutive Director, New York FoundationCynthia Renfro  V I C E  C H A I RPresident & CEO, Civis Consulting, LLCJason McGill  T R E A S U R E RPhilanthropic ConsultantRye Young  S E C R E TA RYPhilanthropic ConsultantKaren AppelbaumOperations Director, Northwest Area FoundationNamita ChadPhilanthropic Consultant Ana ConnerCo-Director, Third Wave FundDesiree FloresDeputy Director, General Service FoundationAldita GallardoProgram Officer, Fund For Trans Generations Paulina Helm-HernándezProgram Officer, US Southeast,  Foundation for A Just SocietyJonathan Jayes-GreenSocial Justice Activist &  Philanthropic ExecutiveCathy K.

This 18th edition of the tracking report represents the next iteration of work from Funders for LGBTQ Issues in our ongoing effort to document the scale of philanthropic support for LGBTQ communities and issues.The report finds that foundation funding for LGBTQ communities and issues has fallen since its record high in 2018, totaling $193 million in 2019 and $201 million in 2020. This is concerning, as it comes at a time when, according to Giving USA, overall foundation support has soared. For every $100 awarded by U.S. foundations in 2020, only 23 cents specifically supported LGBTQ communities and issues",
