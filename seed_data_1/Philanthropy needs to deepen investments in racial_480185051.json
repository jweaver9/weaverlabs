However, a growing number of foundations are doing more to collect, analyze and report this data themselves.2) We need more grants to focus on intersectionality across race/ethnicity and gender, and we need accurate reporting and coding to fully capture giving that is intentionally focusing on women of color, and not simply women AND communities of color. 3) The FC 1000 only gathers grantmaking by the largest foundations while many smaller and often more progressive foundations are doing more to fund leadership of communities of color and gender-specific work. The sector needs to identify giving across all levels of funding.4) There’s a growing ability to track giving for transgender communities, thanks to data collection efforts by Funders for LGBTQ Issues, but more funders could be including non-binary gender options in their data collection.5) CHANGE Philanthropy partners and Candid, Peak Grantmaking, Frontline Solutions and others are exploring ways to sharpen understanding of the state of funding for racial, gender and LGBTQ justice.CHANGE core partners include: Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders in Philanthropy, ABFE, Emerging Practitioners in Philanthropy, Funders for LGBTQ Issues, Hispanics in Philanthropy, Native Americans in Philanthropy, National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity, Women’s Funding Network; & collaborating partner, Neighborhood Funders Group.“Women of color-led organizations are working on solutions that are strategic and effective at addressing structural barriers that prevent all in our communities from thriving. Imagine what we could do if we were resourced at the level that our progressive allies have been resourced. Women of color leaders are on the front lines and ready to go! We just need funder partners to support transformative change by investing in our organizations. ”  — KALPANA KRISHNAMURTHYNATIONAL FIELD AND POLICY DIRECTOR, FORWARD TOGETHER & PRE BOARD MEMBERTOTAL DOMESTIC U.S. GRANT DOLLARS — 2016$24,210,097,146GRANT DOLLARS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS OF COLOR$158,330,5730.6%GRANT DOLLARS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS OF COLOR,GRANT DOLLARS FOR MEN AND BOYS OF COLOR,  AND GRANT DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR ",
