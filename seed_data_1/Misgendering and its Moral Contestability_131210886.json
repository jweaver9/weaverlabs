    "fullText": "Hypatia vol. 31, no. 3 (Summer 2016) © by Hypatia, Inc.Misgendering and Its Moral ContestabilitySTEPHANIE JULIA KAPUSTAIn this article, I consider the harms inflicted upon transgender persons through “misgender-ing,” that is, such deployments of gender terms that diminish transgender persons’ self-respect, limit the discursive resources at their disposal to define their own gender, and causethem microaggressive psychological harms. Such deployments are morally contestable, that is,they can be challenged on ethical or political grounds. Two characterizations of “woman”proposed in the feminist literature are critiqued from this perspective. When we consider whatwould happen to transgender women upon the broad implementation of these characteriza-tions within transgender women’s social context, we discover that they suffer from twodefects: they either exclude at least some transgender women, or else they implicitly fosterhierarchies among women, marginalizing transgender women in particular. In conclusion, Iclaim that the moral contestability of gender-term deployments acts as a stimulus to regularlyconsider the provisionality and revisability of our deployments of the term “woman.”In this article I undertake an analysis of the harmful, oppressive, and contestablepractice that I call “misgendering.” The focus will be on transgender women, and Itake misgendering to mean something broader than simply the use of male pronouns,or of designations associated with being male or with masculinity in referring totransgender women. Here, the notion includes the use of gender terms that excludetransgender women from the category woman,1 or that hierarchize that category in away that marginalizes transgender women.2 One of my main contentions is thatoppressive or harmful deployments of gender terms are subject to ethically or politi-cally grounded challenges—that is, are morally contestable—irrespective of the com-petencies, epistemic or linguistic, of those who deploy them. In particular, I present amore detailed critique of two feminist conceptions of women that misgendertransgender women.Transgender persons, as well as those who do not conform to societal expectationsaround gendered linguistic usage, appearance, and behaviors, are discriminated againstand marginalized (Shelley 2008; Beemyn and Rankin 2011).3 I consider gender con-ceptions and gender terms from the point of view of the transgender (or trans)community, with a view to revealing how transgender persons are subject to a lin-guistic form of moral harm and political oppression. I do not justify this methodologi-cal stance in this article. The approach is, I hope, familiar within feminist theory(Hartsock 2003; Haslanger 2012a, 24), and is aptly characterized by Miranda Fricker:“Let us suppose our methodological injunction to be as follows: Whatever you wantto understand, try taking a look at it from the point of view of the powerless, thoseon the losing end of the practice you want to explain” (Fricker 2012, 289). Sociallyand politically dominant gender categorizations have a real effect on human lives,with transgender people often on the “losing end” of the practice. Adopting thetransgender standpoint allows me to develop certain insights about gender-basedoppression that are not available and are not even considered by cisgender, that is,nontransgender, feminist theory.Yet that is not all that is to be said about the methodological perspective I amadopting. Although trans men and other gender-nonconforming persons may be sub-ject to the harms of misgendering, my focus here is on transgender women. More-over, in several sections of this article, I circumscribe the transgender standpointfurther to adopt the point of view of the non-passing transgender woman. In essence,I look within the community of transgender women, and within that community,attempt to pick out a group that is marginalized and discriminated against, perhapseven within that community (Hardie 2006). Being able to pass as a cisgender womanis a type of privilege, and should be viewed as such. In short, the position of thenon-passing transgender woman is a kind of sequentially nested standpoint: within agiven oppressed group (transgender persons), I focus on the group who call them-selves or self-identify in some way as women. Then within that group, I focus onmembers of a sub-group that is subject to hierarchical marginalization, who areregarded—sometimes within their own community—as “lesser” women.4 I do sobecause it is critically incisive in cases of some uses of the term “woman” to adoptthe point of view of transgender minorities-within-minorities, moving as far as practi-cally possible toward the social margins of group membership and identity.5 This lat-ter view will become particularly salient when I discuss family-resemblance accountsof the category woman in section 3.2.In the next section I list and describe the principal harms that arise for trans-gender persons from misgendering. In section 2, I then distinguish and describeextensional and intensional approaches to gender terminology. I argue that bothapproaches can fail to capture the moral and political claims a transgender womanmight have with respect to gender-term deployments. In section 3 I describe inmore detail the idea that gender-term deployments can be morally contestable, anddevelop guidelines for detecting when this might be the case. I proceed to applythe guidelines, along with a suitably developed criterion of (un)acceptability, tosome uses and meanings ascribed to the term “woman” in feminist philosophyliterature. I conclude by voicing a concern about my approach, and with a moregeneral observation about feminist theorizing in relation to transgender and gender-nonconforming minorities.Stephanie Julia Kapusta 5031. THE HARMS OF MISGENDERINGMisgendering can cause psychological harm, moral wrongs, and political disadvantage.Let me briefly explain what I mean by these three types of harm, as the assumptionof their existence is crucial for what follows. I will summarily refer to these harmswith terms such as “moral harms,” “political oppression,” and so on. I will assumethat misgendering causes one or more of the following harms:1.1. PSYCHOLOGICAL HARMS: MICROAGGRESSIONSA microaggression is characterized as follows: “Microaggressions are the everyday ver-bal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional orunintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to targetpersons based solely upon their marginalized group membership” (Sue 2010, 3).Transgender persons are subject to microaggressions (Nordmarken 2014; Nordmarkenand Kelly 2014).6 Research indicates that microaggressions “may on the surfaceappear quite harmless, trivial, or be described as ‘small slights,’” but “have a powerfulimpact upon the psychological well-being of marginalized groups” (Sue 2010, 3).Those subject to them may suffer from chronic health problems, persistent anxiety,fatigue, stress, hypervigilance, anger, fear, depression, shame, and a sense of loneli-ness. The harm of micro-aggressive misgendering in relation to transgender people iscommonplace in many different contexts of social interaction (Nordmarken 2014,130; Nordmarken and Kelly 2014, 150–51).1.2. MORAL HARMS: EPISTEMIC INJUSTICES AND THE UNDERMINING OF SELF-RESPECTTransgender persons are denied the discursive resources to participate in furtheringsociety’s understanding of their own gender and—I would add—of gender more gen-erally. By being persistently classified as a “man” according to particular conceptionsand descriptions, a transgender woman is denied participation in shaping thosedescriptions herself. This is an instance of what Fricker calls hermeneutical marginal-ization. Fricker proceeds to define hermeneutical injustice as “the injustice of havingsome significant area of one’s social experience obscured from collective understand-ing owing to hermeneutical marginalization” (Fricker 2006, 102).The primary harm that emerges from hermeneutical injustice, according toFricker, is a situated hermeneutical inequality, that is, “the concrete situation. . . suchthat the subject is rendered unable to make communicatively intelligible somethingwhich it is particularly in his or her interests to be able to render intelligible”(Fricker 2006, 103). This harm may be tied to an imposed, “authoritative” interpreta-tion of the subject’s experience that constitutes her social identity. At the very least,it contributes to robbing transgender women of the power to express their own senses504 Hypatiaof self, and of the opportunity to develop a language and conceptual resources thatarticulate those senses of self.Besides injustices of an epistemic nature, misgendering undermines self-respect. Bythis I mean the worth a person recognizes in her own agency and her own life plans,inasmuch as they are her own (Rawls 1999, 286). Without self-respect, action itselfis impeded. This kind of self-respect—distinguished from the self-evaluation involvedin self-esteem—can be “undermined by the words or actions of others” (Brake 2013,66). Because a person’s gender identity can be part of her life struggle, and one ofthe most central values of who she is, misgendering—especially when persistent—canlead to an erosion of a transgender person’s plans to lead the life she wishes to lead,indeed, to an erosion of pursuing any of her own plans for life.1.3. POLITICAL HARMS: OPPRESSION AND DOMINATIONIf definitions of who a transgender woman is misgender her, so that she is a “man” inthe eyes of the law and of the state, then she will be subject to additional burdensand discrimination to which citizens should not be subject, and she may have limitedaccess to goods and services. For example, if a transgender woman cannot legallychange the gender marker from “male” to “female” on her driver’s license or heridentity card due to legal definitions or administrative interpretations of those terms,she becomes exposed to possible abuse and discrimination, along with the continualburden of explaining herself to medical insurance representatives, police officers, andsundry officials. She may also face discrimination at work and in finding accommoda-tion. Following Iris Marion Young, such political and administrative effects are exam-ples of oppression understood as “the institutional constraint on self-development,”as well as domination, “the institutional constraint on self-determination” (Young2011, 37).2. INTENSIONAL AND EXTENSIONAL APPROACHES TO GENDER-TERM DEPLOYMENTSImagine Laura. Laura is a transgender woman, say around fifty-five years old. Shebecame increasingly unhappy and struggled emotionally for many years with her gen-der identity, concerned that a decision to transition would ruin her marriage anddestroy her family. Because of high blood pressure and diabetes, her doctors haveadvised against sex reassignment surgery. She takes hormones but—perhaps due tothe fact that she is a “late transitioner”—they do not seem to have much of a femi-nizing effect on her appearance. She wears female attire and sometimes make-up, buthas the physical stature, facial features, and voice that would usually be perceived bymost as typically “masculine.” In short, Laura does not “pass” as a woman in mostsocial contexts. Laura will be taken as a hypothetical test-case throughout theanalyses that follow. She is a fictional character, but not very different from severaltransgender persons I know.Stephanie Julia Kapusta 505Can Laura be included in the category woman? To answer this question, we canplausibly adopt two approaches: the first begins with the intension or connotation ofthe term “woman”; the second takes the extension or denotation (referents) of theterm as its starting point. This dual nature of linguistic terms, variously called “com-prehension” and “denotation,” “connotation” and “denotation,” “sense” and “refer-ence,” points at a dichotomy between “what a term means and what it denotes”(Fitting 2015). The meaning, sense, or connotation of the term will usually consist ofa group of propositions, a description, that individuals must satisfy in order for theterm to apply to them. I will call this the intensional approach to the term“woman.”7 Alternatively, one can start with the referents of the term, that is, proposean ostensive definition. I will call this an extensional approach to the term“woman.”8 When one asks whether the term “woman” applies to Laura or not, bothapproaches are, in principle, possible. More specifically, it seems intuitive that onemight consider the following ways to determine whether Laura is a woman. Onemight ask,1. Are there some biological, social, or psychological facts that establish that Laurais a woman? Laura is a woman if she satisfies the relevant propositions thatenter some proposed description (compare Mallon 2006, 530–31). The approachis intensional.2. Is Laura, in general and for the most part, called a “woman” by the competentusers of the English language who encounter her? This is a question about thereferents of the term “woman” according to a standard of linguistic use. Thedefinition of “woman” is not descriptive but ostensive, and the approach isextensional.Let us say that the use of a gender term to refer to individuals, or the descriptionassociated with a gender term, is a gender-term deployment. In the former case, thedeployment will be called extensional; in the latter, it is intensional. With these dis-tinctions in mind, let us look, in turn, at intensional and extensional deployments of“woman” with respect to Laura.2.1. INTENSIONAL DEPLOYMENTS OF “WOMAN”We can determine whether Laura satisfies an anatomical description associated withthe term “woman” by observing her body. In case of uncertainty or dispute—forexample, if she is intersex—we defer to medical experts with specialist knowledge ofhuman physiology, and decide the question according to their more detailed andrefined descriptions.9 Second, we can determine whether Laura satisfies a socialdescription associated with the term “woman” by observing the social facts aboutLaura in an analogous way: social position, and social behaviors and attitudes, forexample. In case of doubt—for example, in case some of her social positions or socialbehaviors are difficult to interpret—we would again defer to experts: to sociologists,anthropologists, or social psychologists perhaps, who possess a more refined and better506 Hypatiainformed description. Further, Laura might also satisfy a psychological descriptionassociated with “woman.” Yet we might worry that Laura’s internal sense of gender isnot transparent to herself, or that she has some sort of mental illness, in which casewe would defer to the opinion of a psychiatrist or psychologist. Again, it is usuallyassumed that these experts possess a more sophisticated, scientifically groundeddescription of psychological states that Laura would need to satisfy to be called a“woman.”2.1.1. Problems with Deference to Expert OpinionSo much seems intuitively plausible. But let us ask some questions about all thesedescriptions. Some theories of meaning point out that our conceptual content or inten-sions are often inadequate. For example, semantic externalism—the view that concep-tual content is individuated at least partly through our relations to the environment(Haslanger 2012c, 373–75)—claims that the descriptions Laura is taken to need to sat-isfy—even those of experts—may be incomplete or erroneous. This is why Tyler Burgeintroduces the distinction between concepts and conceptions, a distinction that cap-tures the idea that language users can talk and think about something using the conceptof some x, but their articulation of how they understand x, their conception of x, maybe incomplete or erroneous. Examples from the history of science support the view thatconcepts or “translational meanings” may remain the same, while conceptions or “lexi-cal meanings” can change (Burge 1986, 716; 1993, 316–17). A term—such as “atom,”for example—picks out what we are talking about, despite the imperfections or incom-pleteness in the way we explicate it as our science advances.We can thus conclude from the possible “disjunct” between conceptions and con-cepts that expert opinions may themselves be incomplete, and may even be mis-guided. Nevertheless, one might claim that deference to experts as regards themeanings of technical terms or terms of art is still normatively appropriate (Williams1990, 454–55). After all, in the case in which “woman” is understood as a term ofart, experts’ conceptions, even though incomplete and subject to revision, are stillmore adequate than the conceptions articulated by laypeople.The situation is more complicated with categories regarding gender and sexuality,and this poses problems for the normativity of deferential attitudes where socially andpolitically important conceptions and terms are at stake. Where expert terms inflict psy-chological harm or are oppressive, deference to those regarded as experts is inappropri-ate. For example, many psychiatrists once declared that homosexuality was a mentaldisorder; that is, they defended a certain pathologizing and denigrating conception ofhomosexuals. It is when homosexuals themselves got to contest the expert conceptions,and began to mobilize with others around the issue, that change became possible: homo-sexuality was ultimately removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the Ameri-can Psychiatric Association. We can consider another example, more relevant to Laura’ssituation. Until recently, the DSM still categorized transgender persons under a condi-tion called GID—Gender Identity Disorder. The underlying psychiatric conception ofStephanie Julia Kapusta 507gender assumed that a person’s subjective sense of gender should align with physicalsex. Again, it was when experts began to take into account the experiences, testimonies,and criticisms of transgender persons and their organizations that GID was renamed“Gender Dysphoria” in DSM-V, with revised diagnostic criteria (American PsychiatricAssociation 2013).10 Moreover, with human social kinds we often find “looping effects”(Hacking 1995; 1999; Haslanger 2012b, 465–67): those falling under the expert concep-tion can come to influence its content. Such effects may occur without the full aware-ness of those who interact in shaping conceptions—what one might call “interactiveconceptual drift.” What I am suggesting is that a more consciously political and con-certed influence upon expert conceptions on the part of those classified by them doeshappen and does effect change. This politically mobilized influence—although it can beto some degree informed by scientifically based critiques—need not be primarily scien-tific in nature, and can be exerted by laypeople. The point is that its claim is largely eth-ical or political. Deferring to expert opinion in such cases is not obligatory. On thecontrary, contesting such opinion can be ethically recommended.2.1.2. What about “Natural-Kind Terms”?I claim, then, that deference to expert opinion when expert conceptions of genderare politically oppressive or morally denigrating is unjustified, and can reinforce nega-tive social attitudes toward gender and sexual minorities. Now, someone might con-cede what I have claimed so far, as long as we treat the expert conceptions of“woman” as limited to a description of social position or subjective psychologicalstates. Yet they may claim that—if “woman” is used as a natural-kind term—myargument is unsound. They may say:I admit that the gender conceptions of psychiatrists and social scientistsare interactive kinds, and more prone to sexist and cissexist bias. And Iconcede that they are contestable, not just within the scientific commu-nity for reasons that are epistemic, but also within the broader commu-nity, in which the reasons for contest are moral and political. Thiscertainly problematizes, within an intensional approach, the proposed pro-cedures to find answers to the questions concerning whether Laura is awoman. But, surely, it is hardly contestable that Laura possesses male geni-talia, and so is a man—at least in some contexts—so that one can answerthe question about whether Laura is a woman in the negative.To answer the objection, I adopt and adapt some considerations from Jennifer Saul(2012). As she has pointed out, there is something wrong even in this case. Onemight claim, for example, that for the purposes of an examination for prostate cancer,Laura is a man, that is, she is a man in the context of “testing-for-prostate-cancer.”The public health service in her country may issue advice that men forty years of ageand over should have their prostates periodically tested. When she goes for such anexamination, the doctor may well call her a “man” and use the pronoun “he,”508 Hypatiabecause he believes Laura satisfies a certain description of what it is to be called a“man” (his approach is intensional). But she will find this use of language offensiveand denigrating. Saul notes:Disagreements over who counts as a woman are simply not to be settledby appeal to the facts of language. They are to be settled by appeal tomoral and political principles. There may well be a single right answerabout what standards should be applied for determining who satisfies thedefinition of “woman” in a particular context; but it will be right becauseit is morally and politically right. (Saul 2012, 204)Let us look more closely at Saul’s idea. Even limited to this particular context, bycalling Laura a “man,” the doctor not only offends her, but he disvalues her personalstruggle of resistance to oppressive gender norms and to society’s prejudice. It is truethat Laura and the doctor have different conceptions of the categories man andwoman, possibly with diverging associated descriptions. The doctor, presumably, is the“expert” in medicine: Laura is not his epistemic peer in this respect. Yet this is notsimply a case of epistemic disagreement, but also of ethical disagreement. Laura, incontesting the use of that term to designate her own person, is making an ethicalclaim, not necessarily a factual claim about her body. It is of moral significance thatshe be able to contest the doctor’s use.11 There is no “deference condition” as thereusually might be when laypeople employ terms of expertise, that is, there is no inten-tion on the part of Laura to use the term “woman” as (medical) experts use it. Thisis because being a woman for Laura is part of what Talia Mae Bettcher calls “existen-tial self-identity.” For her, the avowal “I am a woman” does not invoke the factualquestion “What am I, biologically?” but rather involves “the importance of one’s per-sonal history of relatedness to gender, body, and sex. It will also probably involve thesignificance of the question ‘What does it mean for me to be a woman?’ to one’sinterpretation of one’s past and one’s projects for the future” (Bettcher 2009, 112).There is much more at stake for Laura than there is for the doctor when he usesthe term “man” to refer to her: she may experience triggering effects of various sorts,painful memories of rejection, all of this allied to the undermining of her personalidentity, as well as a threat to her self-respect. I claim that Laura’s objection to thedoctor: “Don’t call me a man,” is not an objection to expert language use as such,but to the denigration of who she regards herself to be, and the denial of her moralclaim to be that person.Given Laura’s input into a dispute over whether she should be called a “man,” thedoctor’s stance should be conciliatory: he ought to come to realize that the employ-ment of “man,” “male,” “masculine,” or “he” is much more than a designation of bodyparts, and is particularly so for Laura. Once the meaning of purportedly natural-kindterms flows over into the ethical, changes in terminology are called for. The doctorshould choose to address Laura, and to discuss her case, in other terms. According tohis medical knowledge, the meaning of “man” includes possession of a prostate. How-ever, he encounters Laura’s first-person ethical authority that, in this case, overrideshis own use of gender terms.Stephanie Julia Kapusta 5092.2. THE EXTENSIONAL APPROACH TO “WOMAN”Laura’s visit to the doctor has already touched on normative language use. Linguisticnormativity is also relevant to asking competent users of the English languagewhether they would call Laura a “woman.” In this case, it is the extension of“woman” that is at stake. We appeal to the authority of the relevant linguistic com-munity. But which community might that be? Who are the competent users? Whoseuse is authoritative? Let us say that Laura is active in a local transgender supportgroup. Within that group—as would be the case in many other similar groups—evenwhen Laura presents in a more “masculine” way, she is unproblematically called“woman” and referred to with the pronoun “she” (Bettcher 2013, 240–41). Yet themembers of these support groups are all competent users of the English language. Ineffect, nonconforming use presupposes “being in the know” of how terms are predom-inantly used (Williams 1990, 455).Here, a possible dispute about the extension of the term “woman” is thus notdecided by questions of linguistic competence, since Laura and her transgender sup-port group are as linguistically competent as anyone else. Perhaps, then, we shouldsimply follow the prevalent or majoritarian use? But it is morally problematic toclaim that the transgender use of the term “woman” is incorrect or deviant, for it willbe “incorrect” only with respect to a common and “natural” use that is a mechanismfor diminishing Laura’s self-respect and denying her basic rights. One of the justifica-tions of the “common-sense” use would be that transgender persons are using theword “woman” incorrectly, and that they are simply in error, either deluding them-selves or deceiving others (Bettcher 2007). Majoritarian use is susceptible to prejudiceand bias. It can be a tool to maintain asymmetries of social power, a tyranny ofthe (linguistic) majority. Once again, ethical or political norms problematize theapplication of linguistic norms.3. GENDER-TERM DEPLOYMENTS WITHIN FEMINIST PHILOSOPHYI have so far argued that oppressive or harmful deployments of gender terms are sub-ject to ethically or politically grounded challenges, irrespective of the competencies,epistemic or linguistic, of those who deploy them. I have, in particular, argued forthis claim by considering the misgendering of transgender women. I now wish tomove away from everyday, personal, and institutional misgendering of Laura andothers like her, and consider gender-term deployments within feminist philosophy. Inmy analysis I consider two forms of misgendering that are unacceptable with regardto transgender women like Laura: first, exclusion from membership in a gender cate-gory woman, and, second, marginalization, that is, location at a lower level of hierar-chy or graded structure within the category woman, or location at its margins.Now, unless Laura has a particular interest in philosophy, she is unlikely toencounter such deployments in her daily life, and it is safe to say that the psychologi-cal or moral harms and political oppression she does face on a daily basis are not of a510 Hypatiatheoretically refined, academic kind. So, in talking of misgendering, how am I justi-fied in making the move from a common, everyday type of gender-term deploymentto a gender-term deployment within philosophy?My claim is not that the philosophical accounts of gender that follow are actuallyoppressive or morally harmful. What I am claiming is that a criterion for decidingtheir acceptability resides in seeing what would happen to people like Laura if philo-sophical gender-term deployments were broadly applied at the social and politicallevels. Acceptable theorizing has a moral or political basis. We can ask about exclu-sion and marginalization, because of how gender-term deployments would affect Lauraif broadly deployed within her social environment. The criterion for unacceptabilityis expressed counterfactually:Let x be a philosophical deployment of the gender term “woman.” Then xis unacceptable from a transgender standpoint if x would be an oppressiveor harmful gender-term deployment with respect to some group of trans-gender women when implemented (broadly applied) within society.By “implementation” I mean common acceptance of a particular understanding orusage of a gender term within the social environment, or the application of thatusage or meaning in law or government policy. The counterfactual criterion for unac-ceptability is relative to a transgender point of view. I do not exclude the possibilitythat, for some purpose or other, the deployments I critique may be adequate. Neitherdo I state “from the transgender point of view,” as there are many transgender pointsof view. For example, certain deployments of “woman” within the philosophical liter-ature that would be harmful or oppressive to some transgender women when broadlyimplemented, may not be so for genderqueer trans people. Further, my characteriza-tion of the criterion presupposes some knowledge of how transgender women actuallylive within society, which reveals the potential harms of gender-term deployments.Finally, if gender-term deployments are unacceptable, upon broad implementationthey would be morally contestable in the sense explained earlier: Laura or otherswould possess justified ethical or political reasons to challenge them.With our counterfactual unacceptability criterion in hand, we can now proceed toconsider some philosophical deployments of the term “woman,” and see what wouldhappen if they were socially or politically implemented within Laura’s social context.3.1. EXCLUSION: ALCOFF’S INTENSIONAL DEPLOYMENT OF “WOMAN”In her account of what it is to be a woman, Linda Alcoff is concerned to maintainthe material, “objective basis” for sexed identity. She proposes that women are differ-entiated from men by a specific “relationship of possibility to biological reproduction,with biological reproduction referring to conceiving, giving birth, and breast-feeding,involving one’s own body” (Alcoff 2006, 172). The possibilities Alcoff is discussingrefer to “practices, expectations, and feelings with regard to reproduction” irrespectiveof their actuality, so that, for example, infertile women, postmenopausal women, asStephanie Julia Kapusta 511well as prepubescent girls are included. The particular functions of biological repro-duction thus configure females’ interpretive horizons because of “the ways in whichwe are embodied” (176).The prospects that Laura will be called a “woman” on Alcoff’s account are ratherpoor, but perhaps not completely hopeless. Maybe Laura has always wanted to con-ceive, give birth, and breast-feed, even as she was fully aware that such things werephysically impossible for her. Thus, it would seem that—on Alcoff’s account—she isvery close to some infertile cisgender females. However, one could conceive of maleswho have wanted to give birth, but who—unlike Laura—are perfectly happy to bemen within society. Perhaps Alcoff’s insistence that the relationship of possibilityinvolve one’s own body, or the ways in which females are embodied, takes us towardan interpretation that is meant to rule out such cases.Alcoff associates the possibility of pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, and rape withfemales’ horizons that are carried “throughout childhood and much or all of our adultlives.” She is thereby also invoking a notion of female socialization, linked to expec-tations and practices around female reproduction, centered on the embodiment ofthe person involved. We should conclude that because Laura has a male embodi-ment, this type of biology-constrained socialization is not hers. One could perhapssuitably modify and clarify Alcoff’s description of satisfaction criteria for being awoman but, as it stands, her intensional deployment of “woman” will exclude Laura.If broadly implemented in Laura’s context, Alcoff’s intensional deployment would jus-tify continued misgendering of at least some transgender women, causing psychologi-cal, moral, and political harm. Such considerations reveal that Alcoff’s gender-termdeployment is unacceptable from a transgender perspective.12Why does Alcoff place so much emphasis on features of reproductive function?Much feminist theorizing and activism has centered on reproductive rights. Authorssuch as Alcoff wish to ground their theories in the material embodiment (“materialcontent” [Alcoff 2006, 174]) characterized by gestation, lactation, menstruation, andthe like, as well as the experiences of social life that ensue. Alcoff states:The significance of the division of labor in the process of biological repro-duction is not unstable or undecidable all the way down. There is muchthat is variable about it, and social conditions can make pregnancy a truedisability, but it will never have the range of variable significance that eyecolor, skin color, or height can have. Its objective significance is trans-formable only by technology. To categorize human beings on the basis ofa biological division of labor is thus to recognize an objective type. (Alcoff2006, 175)In the face of concerns that my approach simply ignores the biological materiality ofreproductive function, let me stress that I do not dispute that the division of repro-ductive labor has been significant in analyzing “women’s” oppression in the past, andwill continue to be so in many contexts. It is certainly important to recognize specificbiological facts that ground vulnerability and exploitation. However, the crucial ques-tion from a transgender perspective is whether the biological differences ought to be512 Hypatiathe basis for labeling people as “woman” and “man” in an exclusive, exhaustive way,that is, in all possible contexts, including Laura’s social context. And one can ask, asI do, what harms might emerge for trans people by doing so. Additionally, there arenow people claiming to be “men” (transgender men) who give birth. Reproductiverights then cease to straightforwardly be a “women’s issue.” The question is thus notone concerning the biological facts of the matter, but one that regards finding a ter-minology that inflicts no psychological, moral, or political harms on marginalizedindividuals.3.2. INTENSIONALLY DEPLOYED GRADABILITY: EXCLUSION AND MARGINALIZATIONGradability and rankings emerge in the case of family-resemblance approaches tointensional deployments of “woman.” Here, the “nonpassability” and physical featuresof transgender women like Laura become particularly salient, since the accountsostensibly rely on resemblance, and nonpassing, nonoperative transgender women likeLaura will presumably exhibit very little resemblance to paradigmatic members of thecategory woman. Indeed, they may possess greater “resemblances” to paradigmaticmembers of the contrast category man.Several authors have proposed family-resemblance accounts of the concept ofwoman (Stoljar 1995; Hale 1996/2006; Cressida Heyes 2000; Lindemann Nelson2002; Frye 2011; Garry 2011; Stoljar 2011). Here, I will limit myself to consideringJohn Corvino’s approach (Corvino 2000), since inasmuch as he wishes to take intoaccount the ethical dimension of gender-term deployments, his account might super-ficially be regarded as similar to my own.13Corvino describes how a collection of properties, such as biological sex, self-conception, sexual orientation, and feminine or masculine presentation, plausiblyconstitute part of our concept of gender without, however, that concept being reduci-ble to any of them (Corvino 2000, 176). There are no necessary and sufficient condi-tions for being a woman, but being one involves possessing some determinate numberof the cluster of features, or perhaps a few of the more important features. Corvinoacknowledges that gender thereby is conceived as a “continuous rather than a dis-crete property” and people can be “more or less” members of gender categories (177).Family resemblance thus establishes categorical gradability. I will return to this pointshortly. For now, let us note that Corvino distinguishes the conceptual issue of whichgender someone belongs to, from the ethical issue of what people should be called(179). I understand Corvino to be implying that one might conceivably have a situa-tion in which Laura, for example, is, conceptually speaking, a “man”—or perhaps “in-tergendered” (179)—but should, nevertheless, be called a “woman” for ethicalreasons, for example, for the reasons of moral harm and political oppression that Ipresented in section 2. So, Corvino seems to be invoking something like a principleof “moral contestability” like my own. But we can see the substantial difference frommy own position if we apply the counterfactual unacceptability criterion to Corvino’sgender-term deployments. We could formulate the following gender-term deploymentStephanie Julia Kapusta 513for Laura or at least some transgender women: “she is really [insert: the family-resemblance description, connoted by “man” or “intergendered”], but due to ethicalconsiderations should be called as if she were [insert: family-resemblance descriptionconnoted by “woman”].”If broadly implemented within societal use or within law and policy, Laurawould not be seen as “really” a woman. Calling her a “woman” would be merelya pitying concession to someone who—in the final analysis—has simply got hergender wrong. This will not likely limit the harms I described earlier, particularlythe undermining of self-respect. Moreover, the implicit idea behind concessionarygender-term deployment is, ultimately, one of subordination. For in this case, who-ever thus decides to call Laura a “woman” does not take Laura’s own testimonyseriously. Laura is still potentially subject to hermeneutical injustice, as hercredibility in matters of her own gender is denied. Corvino’s account is thusunacceptable.14Suppose, on the other hand, that—in a family-resemblance intensional deploy-ment—Laura is not excluded, but possesses a resemblance to other members of thecategory deemed sufficient for membership in the category woman. She will, on mostfamily-resemblance accounts—and certainly on Corvino’s account—find herself atthe “margins” of this category: not possessing passing privilege or female sex organs,her “resemblance” is, arguably, of a rather tenuous kind. Although this type of “onlyjust” category membership for some transgender women does not logically imply theirsocial subordination and marginalization, its systematic social and political implemen-tation would create gender-based hierarchies and would, I claim, tend to produce amarginalizing effect. Moreover, on a family-resemblance account, Laura plausiblyresembles paradigmatic members of the category man. Such an approach can thusintensionally deploy the terms “woman” and “man,” so that Laura is called both. Butthe deployment of “man” to designate Laura will still have the harmful and oppres-sive effects I described earlier.154. BUT WHO ARE “WOMEN”?I have focused on gender terms and their deployments. Some readers might find itstrange that I have not touched upon the metaphysical question of whether Laurais a woman, nor on what it is that makes her a woman. To do so, I would haveto deploy the gender term “woman” in a more specific way than I have done inthis article, invoking intensional or extensional criteria, with the accompanyingdanger of excluding or marginalizing at least some people. While not denying theimportance of the metaphysical question, I have chosen, instead, to look at theharms that gender-term deployments can cause, arguing for Laura’s and others’moral entitlement to the contestation of certain deployments of “woman.” How-ever this term is deployed, it is ethically and politically desirable to remain criti-cally aware of the moral contestability—and hence the revisability—of many of itsdeployments.514 HypatiaNOTESI would like to thank Natalie Stoljar, Helen Fielding, and Samantha Brennan for com-ments on earlier versions, and, in particular, Carolyn McLeod and Richard Vernon fortheir painstaking and incisive critiques. I also thank Meghan Winsby for giving me theidea of looking at microaggressions, and participants in a colloquium at Dalhousie Univer-sity, at which I presented many of the ideas in this article.1. I write a category in italics, the members of the category in standard script, andthe terms used to denote the members of a category in quotation marks. Thus, a particularwoman is called a “woman” and is a member of the category woman.2. By marginalization I have in mind any description or characterization of the cate-gory woman that will situate at least some transgender women as borderline cases, or asnoncentral cases of women with respect to paradigm members of the category woman.3. I will use “transgender” as an umbrella term encompassing those who in any waycontest, question, or reject the gender label assigned to them at birth. I will sometimesinterchangeably use the term “gender-nonconforming,” or simply “trans.” (It should benoted that the term trans* is increasingly being used to denote gender-nonconformingpersons who locate themselves beyond binary sex or gender categories [Bettcher 2014]). Acisgender person is one who generally accepts the gender label assigned to him or her atbirth. Cissexism is based on the (often tacit) assumption that transgender persons shouldbe subordinated to cisgender persons along some axis, either in a systemic way withinsocial and political institutions, or on the interpersonal level.4. I do not deny that possessing so-called “passing privilege” brings certain specificproblems of its own for transgender women, especially if they are not “out” as transgen-der. I have known some very “passable” transgender women who have struggled withthe tensions of living as if they were assigned the gender label “woman” at birth. Theyexperience, for example, the constant threat of being “outed,” as well as dilemmasaround getting involved in transgender activism. That said, my position is that, in gen-eral, passing transgender women—even if they do not hide that they are transgender—do not experience the misgendering that nonpassing transgender women must put upwith.5. Of course, I might continue this path toward a marginal standpoint by, for exam-ple, considering nonpassing transgender women of color. Transgender women of color aremore often victims of physical abuse and discrimination than are white transgenderwomen (Beemyn and Rankin 2011, 96). I suspect that misgendering is more common andmore malicious in respect to transgender women of color, and probably more often accom-panied by physical violence and harassment from authorities, such as the police. I do notaccommodate the intersection with race and class in my account. This is certainly adefect of my approach. My hope is that the perspective I present is sufficiently flexible tobe modified in the light of other axes of oppression.6. Transgender persons are, of course, also subject to macroaggressions where the lat-ter are understood as overt—usually physical—aggressions targeting specific groups. In thecase of transgender persons, macroaggressions include rape, murder, and other forms ofphysical violence.7. One could also call it a descriptivist approach (Mallon 2006, 530).Stephanie Julia Kapusta 5158. One might compare Sally Haslanger’s distinction between conceptual and descrip-tive inquiries concerning our gender concepts. A conceptual inquiry will investigate ourconcept of gender by examining our intuitions about various actual and hypothetical casesof what it is to be, for example, a woman, and also by examining definitions or formula-tions of the concept that we produce upon reflection. The starting point here is theso-called manifest concept of woman. An inquiry is descriptive if it focuses on the exten-sion of the concept. It will pick out the various individuals identified as women andattempt to discover whether the designations track a social kind. The point of arrival ofthe investigation is the operative concept of woman (Stoljar 2011, 34–35; Haslanger2012d, 43). The starting points of these respective inquiries are what I call the intensionaland extensional approaches.9. Intersexed persons have experienced—and still can experience—heavily invasivesurgeries on the basis of expert opinion, surgeries that have led to serious physical and psy-chological harms (Karkazis 2008). The intersex movement has campaigned for a halt tocompulsory surgeries as a form of “treatment” of intersexed newborns in cases where life-threatening conditions are not present. Medical interventions and pathologizing classifica-tions such as these give us pause for thought about our “deference” to experts, a point Iwill expand on presently.10. The detailed and intense discussions over the reform of the diagnosis within theWorld Professional Association for Transgender Health is documented in the InternationalJournal of Transgenderism 12 (1) (2010), 12(2) (2010), and 13(1) (2011). Some transgen-der organizations, as well as some psychiatrists, were in favor of removing a diagnostic cat-egory from the DSM-V altogether. However, doing this would have barred manytransgender people from seeking reimbursement from insurers for hormones and surgeries.11. The situation is a result of what Saul calls “mixed contexts” where two partieshave different standards of meaning in mind (Saul 2012, 206).12. Without going into a detailed analysis, I will simply state my conviction that asimilarly critical assessment can be made of Charlotte Witt’s discussion of being a woman(Witt 2011). Like Alcoff, Witt gives special importance to reproductive function.13. I thank an anonymous reviewer for challenging me to clarify how my approachdiffers from Corvino’s.14. Bettcher rightly notes that, according to family-resemblance accounts of gender,transgender women might be best viewed as “women” for pragmatic or political reasons(Bettcher 2013, 236–38). However, many transgender women’s self-identifying claimswould not be validated.15. In her own family-resemblance account, Natalie Stoljar explicitly considers thepossibility of gender-category-membership “overlap” (Stoljar 1995, 285). Indeed, the fam-ily-resemblance approach may be particularly useful to transgender people who are notharmed or oppressed by gender terms such as “androgynous,” “genderqueer,” or “genderfluid.” To be fair to Corvino, his account is meant to help explain how someone mighthave been a woman at one stage in life, only to become (more of) a man in a later stagein life (Corvino 2000, 177). Similarly, Jacob Hale promotes his own family-resemblanceaccount of gender because it most accurately describes the borderline status of “dislocated”trans genderqueers (Hale 2009, 54–56). Irrespective, however, of the utility of family-resemblance accounts for describing gender change and borderline gender positions, the516 Hypatiafact remains that such accounts end up misgendering at least some transgender womenand would be morally contestable if widely implemented.REFERENCESAlcoff, Linda. 2006.

    "abstract": "In this article, I consider the harms inflicted upon transgender persons through “misgendering,”\n          that is, such deployments of gender terms that diminish transgender persons’ selfrespect,\n          limit the discursive resources at their disposal to define their own gender, and cause\n          them microaggressive psychological harms. Such deployments are morally contestable, that is,\n          they can be challenged on ethical or political grounds. Two characterizations of “woman”\n          proposed in the feminist literature are critiqued from this perspective. When we consider what\n          would happen to transgender women upon the broad implementation of these characterizations\n          within transgender women’s social context, we discover that they suffer from two\n          defects: they either exclude at least some transgender women, or else they implicitly foster\n          hierarchies among women, marginalizing transgender women in particular. In conclusion, I\n          claim that the moral contestability of gender-term deployments acts as a stimulus to regularly\n          consider the provisionality and revisability of our deployments of the term “woman.",
