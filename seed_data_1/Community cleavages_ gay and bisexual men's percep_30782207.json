Lewis et al.and bisexual men in a mid-sized Canadian city, we find perceivedhierarchies of acceptance for the various subgroups as well as anage effect wherein middle-aged men perceive the least acceptancefor all groups. These differences are linked with the uneven impactof social, political, and institutional changes relevant to gay andbisexual men in Canada.KEYWORDS gay community, social inclusion, mental health,sexual health, HIV/AIDS, community development, social accep-tance, homosexuality, bisexualityDuring the past two decades, health and social science researchers havedevoted considerable attention to the concept of gay community. Their workhas typically focused on urban concentrations of gay and bisexual men, andsometimes lesbian and bisexual women, defined alternately in terms of geo-graphic boundaries (Aldrich, 2004; Nash, 2006), sexual networks (Peacocket al., 2001), and participation in gay and bisexual friendships or organiza-tions (Jin, 2002; Barrett & Pollack, 2005; Frost & Meyer, 2012; Holt et al.,2012; Veinot et al., 2013). Despite these definitional subtleties, gay commu-nity has often been described as a single, unified entity, especially sincethe height of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1990s. During these decades, theso-called gay community became the focal point of HIV surveillance andhealth promotion efforts aimed at gay and bisexual men (Zablotska, Holt, &Prestage, 2011; Wilkinson, 2011).Today, the forces that solidified urban gay communities during thesecond half of the 20th century (e.g., political activism, HIV/AIDS) meetwith technological and political changes (e.g., online communication, same-sex marriage, adoption rights) that may be leading to disinvestment ingay-specific organizations and venues (Rosser, West, & Weinmeyer, 2008;Zablotska, Holt, & Prestage, 2011) and greater association with multiple,mixed “personal communities” defined more by sociability than sexual iden-tity (Holt, 2011; Wilkinson et al., 2011). At the same time, gay and lesbian“families of choice” and safe mortar-and-brick gathering places continueto act as insulators against homophobia, isolation, depression, and still-persistent social scripts that position same-sex attraction as sick or deviant(Weston, 1991; Meyer et al., 2003; McLaren et al., 2008; Kertzner et al., 2009;Hammack & Cohler, 2011; Frost & Meyer, 2012).In an era where public awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic hasdeclined and acceptance for sexual minority identities is ostensibly increas-ing, there is growing interest in (re-)assessing the meaning, durability, andpotential social divisions within gay communities. Recent interventions havesuggested that community and gay community specifically are problematicconcepts. Both concepts mask contingencies in how individuals relate toDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 3others with presumably shared characteristics, or come to feel included ormarginalized within identity-based groups and society at large (Howarth,2001; Dowsett et al., 2001; Rowe & Dowsett, 2008; Holt, 2011). Some studieshave also challenged the assumed positive effects of urban gay communi-ties, noting potential associations with riskier behaviors (e.g., unprotectedsex) alongside protective factors such as HIV testing and health information-seeking (Zablotska, Holt, & Prestage, 2011; Buttram & Kurtz, 2013). Stillothers have noted the persistent exclusion of older men, ethno-racial minori-ties, and HIV-positive individuals in traditional gay scenes (Han, 2007; Fraser,2008). Most quantitative studies that gauge the importance of gay communityto gay men, however, employ a model of community attachment based onactivities such as spending free time with gay men and attending gay venues,rather than subjective experiences (Jin, 2002; Holt et al., 2012; Veinot et al.,2013).Meanwhile, the few studies that have purposefully investigated class,race, or age-based divisions in the gay community have produced mixedresults. Barrett and Pollack (2005), for example, found that primarily White,younger, and middle-class men tended to associate with traditional markersof gay community affiliation, such as coming out early in life, living in agay neighborhood, and attending mostly gay social functions. In contrast,Frost and Meyer (2012), who used more flexible measures of communityconnectedness (e.g., “feeling a bond” with the gay community) found nogender-based or ethno-racially based differences, but found significantlylower connectedness among bisexual men and women. While these types ofstudies have highlighted potential social cleavages in gay communities, theyalso have some limitations. First, they tend to describe the symptoms of socialdivision (e.g., less participation in gay organizations or feeling the lack of abond) rather than potential root causes such as perceived exclusion basedon age, class, or race. Second, they treat gay communities as unitary, staticformations that can be accepted or left. However, historical changes such assame-sex marriage rights and broader acceptance of gay identities in main-stream society have changed the structure of community (e.g., fewer barsand organizations) and disproportionately benefited certain groups, such asa “homonormative” gay, coupled middle class (Duggan, 2002).The broader social dynamics of gay communities are thus treated asincidental backdrops to the psychosocial processes of attachment and inclu-sion in question (Lewis, 2014). Yet there are potentially large differencesin the types of communities formed in different geographical settings—forexample, large nightlife and tourism-based communities that might support“fastlane” lifestyles with higher frequencies of drug use or unprotected sex(Buttram & Kurtz, 2013) versus those in smaller cities where sociality isequally or more present in private homes and groups (Knopp & Brown,2003; Waitt & Gorman-Murray, 2007; Lewis, 2012). There are also differencesin how various forms of urban gay communities have changed over time.Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 4 N. M. Lewis et al.Most North American studies have examined large-city gay communities(e.g., New York, San Francisco, Toronto) that experienced familiar sets oftransitions: formation of same-sex-attracted communities following influxesof single men and women after World War II (Duberman, 1986), subsequentin-migration of young, rurally situated gay men and lesbians (Weston, 1995),and solidification of geographic visibility in the form of urban gay villages(Nash, 2006).Understandings of the gay experience in Canada tend to follow thisimagined linear trajectory, ending with the successful attainment of equalrights (e.g., same-sex marriage in Canada since 2005, adoption by same-sex couples in Ontario since 1995) through lobbies and federal court cases(Smith, 2005; Weeks, 2007; Smith, 2008). These portrayals of gay and lesbianadvancement mask the ongoing marginalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual,and transgender (LGBT) people in many settings in Canada. They also rein-force notions of gay communities as monolithic, usually metropolitan entitiesthat—while still inclusive and protective—have accomplished their politicalmission and are beginning to decline (Rosser, West, & Weinmeyer, 2008).In this study, we ask whether gay communities within this new milieu offera sense of acceptance among gay and bisexual men, how this differs fromthe perceived acceptance offered by the mainstream community, how accep-tance is perceived both for and by different groups of gay and bisexual men,and the extent to which the experience of men living in a mid-sized citymight differ from those in the metropolitan areas studied more commonly.METHODSThis mixed-methods study (Yin, 2003) seeks to more accurately identifyperceptions of acceptance for various age-, race-, and sexual identity-basedsegments of the population within the gay and mainstream communities at apivotal time in the evolution of both urban gay communities and mainstreamsocietal attitudes. While the use of survey data aligns with extant studiesthat measure gay community attachment (Barrett & Pollack, 2005; Frost &Meyer, 2012), the addition of interviews with self-identified gay and bisexualmen and service providers allows for the creation of new, grounded theory(Strauss & Corbin, 1990) about gay community inclusion and its relationshipto the changing social contexts of North America.We employ the concept of perceived acceptance to gauge how the gayand mainstream communities—as imagined by individuals—are perceived tobe oriented toward various groups (e.g., men of color, trans men), rather thanmeasuring individuals’ levels of attachment to a pre-given gay community.This approach offers several advantages over measuring. First, measuringperceived acceptance is a more meaningful indicator of the inclusivity of gayand mainstream communities than simple attachment (i.e., participation).Second, asking respondents to identify levels of acceptance toward multipleDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 5groups (e.g., men of color) and not just the one being surveyed (i.e., gayand bisexual men) allows individuals to reflect on personal exclusion ordiscrimination that might be associated with their other intersecting iden-tities (Moghaddam & Studer, 1997). Finally, our mixed-methods approachallowed for interview narratives to inform our survey design and, throughtriangulation, corroborate and explain the results it produced.This study is part of a larger project called Health in Middlesex MenMatters (HiMMM), which was initiated following a 2006 forum organizedby the Regional HIV/AIDS Connection (RHAC, formerly AIDS Committeeof London) to discuss health needs and challenges for London-Middlesex’sLGBT, two-spirit, and queer communities. The HiMMM Project was formedto examine how the forum-identified themes of community, communica-tion, and homophobia influence the lives and health of local gay andbisexual men, specifically. As a community-based collaborative researchproject, partners on HiMMM include RHAC, the University of WesternOntario, Middlesex-London Health Unit, Options Clinic for HIV Testing atthe London Intercommunity Health Centre, St. Joseph’s Infectious DiseasesCare Program, and Gay Men’s Sexual Health Alliance of Ontario. London-Middlesex, Ontario, the study site, is located halfway between Toronto,Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. London is the seat of Middlesex County andthe eleventh largest city in Canada, comprising approximately 366,000 resi-dents and another 70,000 in the surrounding county (Statistics Canada, 2011).Statistics Canada estimates that 34% of the Canadian population lives in areasconsidered to be London-Middlesex’s “peer group”: mixed urban-rural areaswith average numbers of both Aboriginal residents and immigrants (StatisticsCanada, 2009). As of 2006, 11.7% of the population of Middlesex County wasa visible minority, with the largest populations being Black, Latin American,and Arab (about 2% of the population each) and Chinese and South Asianresidents representing slightly smaller segments (Statistics Canada, 2006).The study sample, which generally mirrors these characteristics, thereforeoffers an opportunity to assess the dynamics of social acceptance outside ofCanada’s largest cities.HiMMM Project data were collected in two phases: an initial phaseof qualitative semistructured interviews and a second phase of quantitativeinformation gathered using an online questionnaire. During 2009, semistruc-tured interviews were conducted with 15 local gay and bisexual communitymembers and five service providers. Gay and bisexual men, 16 years orolder and residing in Middlesex County, were sampled purposively based onage, ethnicity, HIV status, location, and sexual orientation. Service providers,which comprised a physician, an HIV testing provider, and counselors andcoordinators from community organizations, were also sampled purposivelybased on their experiences working with local gay and bisexual men.Community members were asked about gay and bisexual community andidentity; access to health and wellness services; and spiritual, emotional, andDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 6 N. M. Lewis et al.sexual health. Service providers were asked about their experiences servinggay and bisexual populations, including coming out counseling and work-ing with other local organizations to meet service user needs. Since gay- andbi-identified trans men (female-to-male) are increasingly viewed as part ofthe gay community (Bockting, Benner, & Coleman, 2009), and since sometrans women (male-to-female) have histories or attachments within commu-nities of gay and bisexual men, results relevant to these populations are alsoconsidered. Interviews lasted 30–120 minutes and were audio-recorded andtranscribed verbatim. No remuneration was offered for participation. Afterreviewing the transcripts, the HiMMM team designed the survey, which waspretested and pilot-tested by local gay and bisexual volunteers.The team collected online survey data from 202 gay and bisexual men in2011–2012. Eligibility criteria allowing access to the online survey includedage 18+, having an address in Middlesex County (though not necessarily apermanent address, as in the case of students), and identifying as gay, bisex-ual, or as a man who has had sexual experience with or strong, continualsexual attractions to another man. Questionnaire participants were recruitedthrough online Web sites, smartphone apps, and informal referrals betweengay and bisexual men. Demographic characteristics of the sample are shownin Table 1. Participants received a $10 gift card as a token gift for complet-ing the survey, with chances to win additional prizes if they referred othergay and bisexual men who also completed the survey. Sociodemographicvariables in the survey included age, ethno-racial identity, birth country,educational attainment, household income, employment status, area of res-idence, marital status, relationship status, and sexual orientation identity,adapted from the Canadian Community Health Survey (Statistics Canada,2008) and other community surveys. The project team developed 10 ques-tions assessing perceptions of acceptance of gay men, bisexual men, menof color (sexuality not specified), transgender men (sexuality not specified),and transgender women (sexuality not specified) from within the gay com-munity and the broader Middlesex-London community. Responses to eachquestion asking how accepting the broader and (separately) gay communi-ties were toward each group were expressed in Likert scales ranging from 1(not at all accepting) to 7 (completely accepting).Using NVivo 10, qualitative interview texts were open-coded andgrouped into categories and themes based on team discussions of themesemerging from both the initial forum and the interview data. The team thenused coded data reports to outline perceived processes of community devel-opment and evolution. Quantitative analyses of the questionnaire data wereconducted using SAS version 9.3.1. First, frequencies for sociodemographicvariables were calculated for both the interview and survey samples.Next, paired t-tests were used to test for differences (α = 0.05) betweenrespondents’ perception scores for acceptance of different sexual orientation,race, and gender identity groups within the gay community. Similarly, testswere used to compare acceptance for those same groups within the broaderDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 7TABLE 1 Demographic attributes of survey respondents and interview participants from theHealth in Middlesex Men Matters (HiMMM) studySurvey sample(n = 202) n (%)Interview sample(n = 20)Age group18–24 48 (23.8) 325–34 62 (30.7) 735–44 30 (14.9) 245–54 39 (19.3) 655+ 23 (11.4) 2Ethno-racial groupNon-aboriginal White 176 (87.1) 16Non-aboriginal racialized 19 (9.4) 3Aboriginal 7 (3.5) 1Ethnic or cultural identity indicated∗White Canadian/American/European 180 (89.1) 16Aboriginal 7 (3.5) 0East/South/Southeast Asian 7 (3.5) 0Latin American 5 (2.5) 1Black Canadian/American/African/Caribbean 4 (2.0) 2Middle Eastern 3 (1.5) 0Indo-Caribbean 3 (1.5) 0EducationHigh school not completed 12 (6.0) 3High school completed 20 (10.0) 5Some postsecondary 57 (28.4) 8Postsecondary graduate 112 (55.7) 4Area of residenceNon-rural 194 (97.0) 18Rural 6 (3.0) 2Marital statusMarried or living common-law with a man 55 (27.4) 8Married or living common-law with a woman 6 (3.0) 0Separated/Divorced/Widowed/Never married 140 (69.7) 12Sexual orientation identityHomosexual 153 (89.5) 13Bisexual 17 (9.9) 1Don’t know/Would rather not say 1 (0.6) 1Heterosexual 0 (0.0) 5Trans-identifiedYes 5 (2.5) 1No 195 (97.5) 18Country of birthCanada 185 (91.6) n/aOther 17 (8.4) n/aHousehold income per person< $15,000 30 (15.6) 3$15,000–$29,999 63 (32.8) 3$30,000–$49,999 48 (25.0) 3$50,000–$79,999 28 (14.6) 5$80,000 + 23 (12.0) 3Employment statusEmployed 163 (81.2) 11Non-employed 38 (18.9) 8(Continued)Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 8 N.

Paired t-tests were also used to assess whether participantsviewed the gay community and the broader community as different intheir acceptance of each group. Finally, linear regression was used tomodel the association between age and the perception of acceptance ofeach group by the gay community, and again separately by the broadercommunity. A quadratic term for age was used to allow for a nonlinearassociation. Following these analyses, the team used an iterative processto triangulate and establish complementarity of information across qualita-tive and quantitative data sources (Yin, 2003). Qualitative and quantitativephases of the HiMMM Project were approved by the Non-Medical ResearchEthics Board at the University of Western Ontario. Signed consent formswere obtained from interview participants. For survey respondents, consentwas implied upon reading the letter of information and starting the onlinesurvey.RESULTSBroader Community AcceptanceWithin the broader community, survey respondents perceived distinct hier-archies of acceptance for men of various sexual orientation, genders, andracial identities, with men of color (sexuality not specified) being seen asmost accepted and trans persons as least accepted (Table 1). As shownin Table 2, respondents reported significantly different levels of perceivedbroader community acceptance of each of the selected identity subgroups (p< 0.01), excepting perceived broader community acceptance of gay ver-sus bisexual men. Racialization thus appeared to be less of a perceiveddetriment to acceptance than sexual minority or transgender status.

One interview participant reflected on an adoption sup-port group meeting where he saw widespread support for a middle-class gaycouple:I went to these meetings by myself and there were maybe primarily fiveor six [male/female] couples . . . but there was two men there . . . theypresented themselves as a couple awaiting an adoption and I was verypleased to see that the other couples interacted with these two men asthey would all of the other couples . . . like, you know, “I hope you get achild soon” and that kind of thing . . . so that was very affirming.

Um, if it comesup in conversation then we’ll talk about it or . . . if I’m at an event . . .so, the visibility for [my partner and me] has been very good and it hasn’tbeen very negative because of our positions and our reputations in the[London] community. (Mark, 31, gay-identified)A very mainstream, you know, social organization [United Church ofCanada] linking themselves with Gay Pride, I mean that’s a very positivething. It’s certainly not an alternative organization or a community-basedgroup. (Peter, 51, gay-identified)At the same time, historical events in London suggest a more mixed atti-tude toward gay and bisexual men within the broader community. In 1993,two local men were arrested on child pornography charges following thediscovery of bags of videotapes in a nearby river. Over the next two years,a widely publicized police investigation called “Project Guardian” linkedthe gay community with the possible existence of a large child pornogra-phy ring. While only the initial two men arrested were convicted on childpornography charges, at least 2,296 interviews were conducted by police,64 men were charged for various offenses, some were arrested, and sev-eral were also outed (Sas & Hurley, 1997). During the same period, theLondon police arrested large numbers of men for cruising in bathrooms andparks (Janoff, 2005, pp. 232–233). In 1995, the year that Project Guardianconcluded, former mayor Diane Haskett refused the Homophile AssociationDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 11of London Ontario’s (HALO’s) request for the city to issue a proclamationfor the London Gay Pride celebration. Haskett insisted that she would notissue “controversial” proclamations, and the city council voted 13–5 againstit. HALO filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Ontario,which decided in 1997 that both Haskett and the London City Council haddiscriminated against HALO. The mayor and council were each fined $5,000.Haskett subsequently posted an ad in the London Free Press claiming thedecision was incorrect and violated constitutional freedoms.In this historically hostile social environment, it is feasible that the over-all high reported acceptance for gay and bisexual identities masks somevariation in men’s experiences based on their socioeconomic and profes-sional positions. Those who do not fit easily into the mainstream or requireservices tend to suffer from the lack of visibility and resources in a smallercommunity where “the closet may be bigger than people on the street” (Carl,54, MSM-identified). Mainstream public health services in London-Middlesex,for example, have built only limited capacity to address LGBT health needs.“[W]e live in a conservative government who doesn’t care about gay issues,MSM issues, the health aspects of a small minute population and there are noservices,” one participant said. “There is a variety of mental health services,um, but again, they’re not directed to the gay population and oftentimesthere you may have to go to through two or three counsellors before youfind one that’s appropriate” (Steve, 45, gay-identified). Another comparedthe availability of health information in London and Toronto: “in Toronto,you know, you have a community that’s so well connected and so wellinformed that information is just, you know, jumping off the trees really. Butin London you really have to . . . go searching for it to find it” (Dean, 27,White, gay-identified). Concerns about anonymity of services in a mid-sizedcity may discourage some from using the limited services available. Oneprovider recounted,When I first started [at a satellite clinic] and I couldn’t draw blood verywell, I would say you can come by tomorrow to our main site and theywould say “no, no I can’t go down there because so and so works there.I don’t want them to know that I’m getting blood work for HIV . . . causeI’m not out to her in the community. (Jason, 53, service provider)Another participant reflected that the continued marginalization of gay andbisexual men in mainstream health care settings had made the local HIVclinic and counseling center an important support structure for local gay andbisexual men.There’s a fundamental belief that even within the structured systemsthat [gay people are] not right, you know, and I’m talking about theAIDS Committee focusing on gay issues . . . as a necessity rather thanDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 12 N. M. Lewis et al.simply focusing on HIV issues . . . even though all the psychologists andpsychiatrists say, you know, this is natural. (Steve, 45, gay-identified)In other institutions, such as schools and media outlets, the subtle,ongoing erasure of LGBT issues and identities persists despite official procla-mations of equality, diversity, and inclusion (see Young & Meyer, 2005; Baueret al., 2009). While the London region is associated increasingly with a “cre-ative cities” discourse that equates certain local industries (e.g., education,biosciences) with cosmopolitanism and tolerance (Bradford, 2010), otherdominant sectors such as finance (e.g., London Life Insurance), manufac-turing (General Motors, Toyota, McCormick Foods), and military-industrial(General Dynamics Land Systems tank manufacturing), have been associatedwith heteronormative and sometimes homophobic work cultures and envi-ronments (McDowell, 2001; Embrick, Walther, & Wickens, 2007). Accordingto one participant, even the higher education sector in London-Middlesexsuppressed gay visibilities intermittently:At Kings [College] there was a group of students last year who wantedto do something in the cafeteria in conjunction with Pride activities onmain campus at [University of] Western [Ontario] and they were initiallyrefused to do that . . . they could have a booth and they could educateabout sexual orientation but not celebrate . . . use words that were liketoo condoning. (Peter, 51, gay-identified, White)In local high schools, suppression of gay identities has been often moreovert: “we have the safe schools project here and since that’s been instigated,numerous teachers have been made to take down their safe space signagebecause of objections from parents, so it was a good idea but the followthrough is lousy” (Steve, 45, gay-identified).Others felt that the inaccessibility of the local media limited the possi-bility of a more connected, supportive gay community. “The media is notpromoting,” one participant said,small groups like [RHAC] can’t afford to take out full page ads eachSeptember or the high schools won’t print them in their newsletters thatthere is a safe space to come talk about your issues or concerns . . . so theproblem isn’t necessarily the resource being available, it’s the awarenessof the availability of the resources and either we don’t have the financialresource to make that happen or we live in a culture that doesn’t want itto happen. (Steve, 45, gay-identified)He added that the London-Middlesex mainstream media also seemed toignore ongoing homophobia and hate crime in the region: “I saw on [gayhook-up site] Squirt today there that somebody was assaulted a couple daysago here and someone in Kitchener got the crap beat out of them too . . .Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 13So gay violence is on the rise again, but you know, you don’t ever hearit.” Another agreed, “In London we don’t hear about it on the news . . . it’sall hush-hush and not publicized” (Joe, 18, gay-identified). Although bothnational-level advances in rights and ongoing, more localized marginaliza-tion might be therefore described as issues affecting the Canadian LGBTcommunity at large, they have been experienced differently by the varioussubgroups of gay and bisexual men, potentially leading to the divergingperceptions of inclusion in both the gay community and broader society.Acceptance of gay and bisexual men in the mainstream community,then, may be reserved largely for middle-class community members (e.g.,business owners) who, in turn, mask or minimize their sexual expression tocontinue being accepted.There’s a number of high profile gay [-owned] businesses opened up andthey really revitalized the core, but for the most part their sexuality hasbeen downplayed [in the media]. They’re “young, exciting, interestingentrepreneurs bringing diversity to our core” . . . many of the senior gaybusinesses, the people who I knew were gay had visible, high traffic loca-tions, had the resources to make an impact and change, they didn’t wantto be associated with Gay Pride or gay business, exclusively because thecomment was 90% or more of their business comes from a heterosexualpopulation who enjoy the sass, that classing up and London is an uppermiddle-class community and so they appreciate that sense of decadence. . . not necessarily going to buy into it but they appreciate it. (Steve, 45,White)Another added, “There’s more publications geared to a gay audience nowthan ever,” “but if you witness the way media is going over the last num-ber of years . . . it used to be issue oriented. Canadian gay magazines, likeFab and Outlook are becoming lifestyle magazines . . . It’s not about devel-oping a community, it’s using the community to profit from” (Steve, 45,gay-identified).Middle-class participants also tended to deal with perceived exclusionor marginalization in the broader community by seeking services elsewhereor relocating altogether. One talked about his past unwillingness to disclosehis sexual identity to local doctors and, eventually, the choice to have adoctor in Toronto: “I’ve had doctors in the past where I haven’t disclosed. . . my sexual orientation out of fear of being rejected and, you know, I’mpretty sure that it would have happened before because not all doctorsare as good as my GP [general practitioner] in Toronto” (Dean, 27, gay-identified). Another found acceptance primarily in white-collar institutions heworked in:Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 14 N. M. Lewis et al.I think [acceptance in London is] pretty good . . . to the extent that peoplefeel comfortable sort of being out and you know public in their sexualityin a sense they don’t hide it . . . people will support that and I’d certainlyin my experience here at the firm . . . they’ve been extremely supportiveat the law school and . . . in undergrad that’s sort of when I was comingout. I’ve never had an issue with that . . . I mean, you don’t have to makean apology for it because, you know, you’re fortunate where you workthat it’s just not an issue. (Will, 29, gay-identified)In contrast, he downplays persistent harassment among gay men in London’ssocial spaces as part of the “human condition”:I mean, sure yeah, sometimes you’ll see people in bars or somethingwho are jerks, but that’s just you know the human condition . . . I thinkLondon is a fairly progressive-minded town and um, you know, it’s got afairly educated population between the university and the hospital systemand the health system so you know it’s really not a bad place to be gay.Respondents also perceived high acceptance for men of color (sexualorientation not specified) in the broader London-Middlesex community, evenmore than for gay and bisexual men. As noted, the mean perceived accep-tance for all men of color did not differ statistically for participants fromdifferent ethno-racial groups. However, research participants may be morelikely to report discrimination toward the identity group that is the study’sfocus (gay and bisexual men, in this case) than they are to report personaldiscrimination, which may be connected to intersecting statuses such as race(Moghaddam & Studer, 1997).In contrast, participants observed sustained exclusion of transgenderindividuals in London-Middlesex, mirroring research reporting profoundtransphobia in Ontario’s health care institutions and communities more gen-erally (Bauer et al., 2009). One explained that trans persons in Londonself-protect by remaining invisible: “I knew there was a large trans pop-ulation but it’s not a very visible one . . . I mean those boys and girls theykeep themselves well hidden . . . I believe they just allowed gender reassign-ment surgeries to be covered by [universal public health insurance] again butfor years that was taken out” (Steve, 45, gay-identified).Gay Community AcceptanceMeasuring perceived acceptance of various groups within the London gaycommunity elicited responses markedly different from those regarding thebroader London community (see Table 2). Here, being a man of color or gaywas perceived as most acceptable, with bisexuality less acceptable, and beinga transgender man or woman even less so. As shown in Table 2, perceivedDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 15TABLE 4 Differences in gay and bisexual men’s mean perceived levels of acceptance ofsubgroups, broader community compared to the gay communityDifferencea tb pBroader community acceptance compared to gay community acceptance of . . .Gay menc −1.21 −11.43 <0.0001Bisexual men −0.42 −4.45 <0.0001Trans men −1.09 −10.15 <0.0001Trans women −0.92 −8.68 <0.0001Men of color −0.32 −3.96 <0.0001aDifferences based on a 7-point Likert scale measure.bPaired t-test.cAs an example, gay/bi men perceived that the level of acceptance for gay men within broadercommunity was on average 1.21 points less than their acceptance within the gay community (p <0.0001).acceptance levels for each group differed significantly from one another atp < 0.0001, excepting gay men versus men of color, and transgender menversus transgender women; neither of these comparisons were statisticallysignificant (p > 0.05). Finally, as shown in Table 4, the broader Londoncommunity was perceived as being less accepting than the gay communityfor each group (p < .0001 for each comparison).The high perceived acceptance for gay men within the gay community isperhaps an unsurprising finding. Located within a rural, regional Bible belt,London acts as a magnet for younger, rurally situated LGBT people mov-ing from homophobic environments (Bruce & Harper, 2011). At the sametime, because it is also located less than 200 miles from Toronto, groupssuch as gay students and white-collar workers might travel to Toronto fornightlife and services, or eventually move there (Rowe & Dowsett, 2008;Lewis, 2012). The London-Middlesex gay community is also a transient entitywhose shifting dynamics affect the durability of community infrastructures.In 2005, HALO, the city’s central gay community nonprofit organization, bar,and referral center, closed permanently. HALO’s closure left a large phys-ical and psychological gap in the community, leaving a rotating circuit of1–2 bars, a bathhouse, and the local AIDS service organization (ASO) as theonly visible community entry points. For gay men who might not fit easilyinto the remaining gay commercial scene, the ASO is an important supportstructure.[Volunteering at RHAC is] an activity that just makes me feel so goodinside and you know, it’s a reason to get out of bed in the morning. If itwasn’t for [RHAC], you know, I would not want to see where I wouldbe at just because, you know, coming to [RHAC] and having that socialinteraction and knowing that I’m not being judged for being gay, I’m notbeing judged for being HIV positive . . . It’s really important that I comehere” (Dean, 27, gay-identified)Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 16 N. M. Lewis et al.Some felt, however, that RHAC was still perceived primarily as a place for theeconomically disadvantaged or HIV-positive despite its broadened serviceumbrella. “[RHAC] primarily supports . . . more marginalized members ofsociety,” one said (Will, 29, gay-identified). Another added, “[London’s gaymen’s community is] either for people . . . who like the bar scene or whoare [HIV-] infected, but nothing . . . nothing for anybody else. That’s just mytake on what I’m hearing” (Jason, 53, service provider).As in the analysis of the broader community, the high reported per-ceived acceptance for men of color may mask important differences inhow White men and men of color perceive the local gay community. Oneparticipant recounted:I saw one person of colour in the [Pride London] parade and I don’tremember seeing any persons of color observing the parade . . . peopleof colour, um, generally don’t advertise their lives . . . But if I’m one whowas interested in [the parade] . . . I’m going to, you know, enthusiasticallyprovide that information to other black people so they can be there too.I don’t want to be the only token person. (Ronald, did not wish to shareage or sexual identity)He explained further that gay and bisexual men of color may also feelmarginalized where few health or social resources are geared to their specificneeds and experiences:You won’t get a black person or a person of colour coming into thegroup that has 30 white people, one Indian and one Chinese peopleand expecting them to share and be open . . . But if they’re in a groupwith people that are in the same health circumstances that they are inand they’re all the same colour, then there’s gonna be more openness. . . If there were 10 support groups right now and none of them weremulticultural I wouldn’t go to none of them even if I felt that I neededthem.Ronald’s narrative indicates that men of color may feel disconnected fromthe gay community unless providers make efforts to create communalexperiences, avoid tokenization, and allay fears of being outed.Trans participants also delineated themselves as separate from a “main-stream” gay community that they equated with socializing and nightlife atgay venues. One trans-identified participant stated: “I would say the com-munity that I have run into that’s more of the mainstream community, youknow, downtown at the clubs and things like that . . . that is a communitythat I am uncomfortable around . . . You know there is like the club-hoppingcommunity and the not-club hopping community I guess that is what I’d callit” (Rory, 18, straight-identified). This echoes Browne and Lim’s (2010) studyDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 17of Brighton (England’s “gay capital”), which found that trans residents con-nected more closely—geographically and psychologically—with a regionalgender clinic than the local gay community defined by tourism and nightlife.Age-Based Differences in Perceptions of Mainstream and GayCommunity AcceptanceMiddle-aged respondents perceived the lowest levels of acceptance for thevarious identity subgroups in the broader London-Middlesex community (seeFigure 1). When asked to evaluate acceptance for the same subgroups withinthe gay community, middle-aged respondents again reported lower levels ofacceptance than younger or older respondents (see Figure 2).We found asignificant age effect (as indicated by a statistically significant quadratic term)on the assessment of acceptance of all groups other than bisexual men.Younger gay men, who have come of age in a milieu of greater socialacceptance and gay rights (Hammack & Cohler, 2011), typically demon-strated the most optimism about the inclusion of sexual minorities withinmainstream society: “I have a lot of straight friends too that are fine withme being gay and one of my straight friends is really adamant about gayrights . . . I think it’s come a long way in both communities because peo-ple in the straight community are more accepting now and we are morewilling to answer that acceptance and speak out for ourselves” (Joe, 17, gay-identified). Bisexuality was deemed equally acceptable as we observed nostatistically significant difference in gay and bisexual men’s perceived accep-tance of bisexual versus gay men in the broader London community, thoughsome suggested that the acceptance was due to perceptions of bisexuality(Completely accepting)(Not at all accepting)FIGURE 1 Regression results of gay and bisexual men’s mean perceived levels of broadercommunity acceptance of different subgroups, by respondent ageDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 18 N. M. Lewis et al.(Completely accepting)(Not at all accepting)FIGURE 2 Regression results of gay and bisexual men’s mean perceived levels of gaycommunity acceptance of different subgroups, by respondent ageas a stepping stone to being gay rather than a distinct identity. At the sametime, the levels of perceived acceptance for gay men compared with othersexual/gender minority groups echoes recent work claiming that develop-ments in gay rights have cultivated a group of inoffensive, “normal” gaymale subjects that are acceptable to mainstream society, while other groups(e.g., trans people) are made marginal (Duggan, 2002).Middle-aged men’s more pessimistic perceptions of community accep-tance appeared based, in part, on experiences from earlier in life (see alsoKertzner, 2001; Hammack & Cohler, 2011). One spoke about experiences ofschool-based, family-based, and sometimes internalized homophobia amongmiddle-aged men who had grown up in the surrounding rural areas.we’re a feeder community drawing from a lot of smaller communities . . .I grew up in a place called [name withheld], when I came out with myfather he said now why do you want to do that . . . you know how muchI hate fags. . . . there’s this instantaneous revulsion and yet when he soldhis house . . . they found a bag of porn and in there was two very, veryhard-core gay porns. (Steve, 45, gay-identified)He continued, “Our school system . . . where you get the majority of this. . . very few parents . . . who would even consider that [their] child may behomosexual . . . for the most part, no, and it’s a sense of failure. It’s likehaving a disabled, crippled child. You know, there’s tons of guilt. I’m suremy parents went through all of that.”Other middle-aged participants’ perceptions were influenced by reli-gious upbringings in the London-Middlesex region. One noted that experi-ences of self-devaluation relating to religion were common among his peers,Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 19but also among younger men: “You know, so many guys . . . . the family wasso darn religious . . . you’re a gay man, well, the devil was punishing youand stuff like . . . I’m still hearing that, you know from young guys that comeout and say I was abused like whoa . . . there’s still a lot of discrimination,there’s still even from within” (Carl, 54, MSM-identified). Internalized guiltand shame may therefore keep some men from coming out or participatingin gay community until later in life:I haven’t heard a lot of people coming through saying that um, they’vebeen shunned, except you know, unless they’ve been shunned by theirfamily or by their community . . . um, I think the lack of acceptance isoften from within . . . a lot of people who are reassessing their sexualityor . . . 40 years into a marriage to a woman . . . where the intimacy islong gone and everything is great except that they wind up down atthe bathhouse and they’re feeling terrible about it. (Jason, 53, serviceprovider)Men in midlife also appeared most likely to carry forward trauma fromevents in the community’s past: “I’ve heard like historically you know goingback to days where, you know, the mayor wouldn’t declare Gay Pride Dayand . . . right-wing groups demonstrating at some Pride activities and howmuch of that is still happening” (Peter, 51, gay-identified). Younger men,in contrast, were more likely to dismiss discrimination from the mainstreamcommunity as a thing of the past.I think people perceive London as being more conservative than it actu-ally is . . . It’s something that sort of is like the, you know, Diane Haskettthing from years ago, but I mean, you’d think surely after she getstrounced in the subsequent election [in 2006, despite being re-electedimmediately after the legal decision in 1997] that people would say “oh,maybe it’s not so bad. (Will, 29, gay-identified)Mirroring their perceptions of low acceptance for gay and bisexualgroups in London, men in or approaching midlife felt especially disenfran-chised by “a funny split . . . like young people as in university students orcollege students and then everyone else” (Will, 29, gay-identified). Whileyounger men tend to join university and college LGBT groups and continueto patronize the city’s main commercial gay bar, men in midlife have beenleft with fewer social supports and opportunities to connect with other mentheir age.There’s been inklings in attempts to have a support group for older adults,[young adult groups are] basically up to 25, so if you’re coming out at30 or in a married relationship and that falls apart because you reallyDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 20 N. M. Lewis et al.discover that you’re not just bi, you’re not just interested in sex with men. . . there really isn’t many supports out there. (Steve, 45, gay-identified).Like maybe it would be useful periodically to chat with some othermiddle-aged gay men about if there are some issues that come up . . .sexual activity or . . . sort of moving into middle age . . . I realize that allof my close friends in London are heterosexual and I was thinking thisis odd because anywhere else . . . at least a number of my close friendswere gay men. (Peter, 51, gay-identified)Middle-aged participants also commented on the limited number of gay-associated activities and venues that they felt were age-appropriate orinteresting.Not all gays/bisexual or men having sex with men are into drag . . .they’re not all into bingo . . . I’m sure there’s a lot of gay men that loveto go boating . . . Maybe I’m at an age where I do my own thing. (Carl,54, MSM-identified)With the demise of HALO a few years ago there is no social network orbody as such, and typically I’ll hear this at the bathhouse, the folks arethere, and you know they’re not especially sexual but, they don’t like thebar scene, they don’t like the music, they don’t like the atmosphere orwhat the bathhouse is, but they’ll go but saying “why is there nothingfor folks . . . for whom sex is not the be all and the end all?” (Jason, 53,service provider)The comments indicate that while some gay community infrastructure existsin the London region, it is seen as supporting primarily a younger, oftentransient population. While there was insufficient qualitative evidence toexamine why older men demonstrated less pessimism about acceptance thanmiddle-aged men, it is possible that this generation sees the current state ofthe community as more positive because they have survived the AIDS epi-demic, a long-term lack of human rights protections, and the pathologizationand criminalization of sexuality.DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONSWith regard to both the broader London community and the local gay com-munity, respondents perceived a hierarchy of acceptance, with men of colorand gay men perceived as most accepted, bisexual men as somewhat lessaccepted, and trans men and women as least accepted. At the same time,notable variations emerged. Respondents perceived that in the broader com-munity, men of color were more accepted than gay men and bisexual men(who were deemed to be roughly equally accepted). With regard to the gayDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 21community, it was men of color and gay men who were deemed equallyaccepted, while bisexual men were seen as less accepted. Respondentsalso perceived overall greater acceptance in the gay community than inthe broader London-Middlesex community. In addition, middle-aged respon-dents perceived less acceptance for all groups than did younger and olderrespondents.The high level of perceived acceptance for gay men may signifythe growing normalization of gay identities and advances in gay rights.At the same time, comments suggested that acceptance might be directedspecifically toward upwardly mobile, professional gay men, and that thesesegments of the community are also those most able to overcome the lackof social supports in a mid-sized city with a long history of intolerance. Thefigures for men of color suggested that respondents felt that racial diversitywas as accepted as sexual diversity in the gay community, and even moreaccepted than sexual diversity within the broader community. Although thelack of differentiation for acceptance of gay men and men of color in the gaycommunity could be due simply to higher perceived acceptance for gay menin the gay community (and not lower acceptance for men of color), the qual-itative comments suggested that there was only limited integration of thosewith non-White identities into London’s gay community. At the same time,the high perceived acceptance for men of color in the broader communitymight be inflated due to predominance of White respondents in the sam-ple. The high overall perceived acceptance for all men of color in both gayand broader communities and limited quantifiable differences in perceptionsof acceptance across race groups mirrors Frost and Meyer’s (2012) findingthat there are few differences in gay community attachment by race group.However, the qualitative comments regarding perceived invisibility of menof color in the gay community echo other recent qualitative work notingracial hierarchies within gay communities (e.g., Han, 2007).While the difference in perceived acceptance for men of color and gaymen in the gay community was diminished (compared with the broader com-munity), the difference for bisexual men and gay men was amplified (thoughnot significantly so). This might be due to the perception of bisexuality asa conflicted or incomplete sexual identity within the gay community, butas roughly analogous to homosexuality (in terms of acceptability) withinthe broader community. Trans persons were perceived as least acceptedfrom both the mainstream community and the gay community. Trans per-sons have not necessarily enjoyed the greater mainstream social acceptancerecently achieved for gay men and other sexual minorities, and they mayalso lack safe, inclusive spaces within urban gay communities characterizedmore by nightlife and social scenes dominated by gay men than by mutuallysupportive interaction between multiple sexual and gender minority groups.Finally, the age-based segmentation of perceived acceptance sug-gests differing experiences of the London region and its gay communityDownloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 22 N. M. Lewis et al.among men of different generations. While younger men emphasized recentadvances in rights and potential for the future, men at middle age frequentlymentioned both individual traumas from growing up in homophobic envi-ronments as well as more recent traumas (e.g., Project Guardian, the Pridecontroversy) affecting their perceived acceptance of sexual and gender diver-sity in broader London and its gay community. In addition, these feelingsmay be amplified among older, long-term residents of the region comparedwith a younger, transient population who fits more easily into the commercialgay scene and may be living in London only temporarily. These trends mir-ror Barrett and Pollack’s (2005) study noting less gay community attachmentamong older and working-class men, as well as qualitative interventions thatobserve age, gender, and generational differences in broader experiencesof gay community (Browne & Lim, 2010; Zablotska, Holt, & Prestage, 2011;Wilkinson, 2011; Hammack & Cohler, 2011).The differences also reflect social, political, and institutional changesthat have occurred across Canada but that affect different geographic regionsand community subgroups differently. In Canada, the advent of legal rightssuch as same-sex marriage, adoption, and pension benefits have beentreated as roughly universal goods for gay communities (Smith, 2008). Evenso, their lived impacts across the sub-communities and sociodemographicgroups within them may be more mixed. In the new milieu of rights-basedactivism, greater social inclusion in the form of same-sex marriage, pension,and adoption rights was pursued in the federal courts, while conservative-led regional governments (e.g., Ontario’s Harris administration during the1990s and early 2000s) and federal government (the Harper administrationsince 2006) disinvested in health and social services infrastructure gearedtoward vulnerable and minority groups (Hackworth, 2008; Whiteside, 2009).Sustained, grassroots LGBT movements in large cities (e.g., Toronto) haveeffectively resisted the trend of rollback neoliberal governance in Canada,running services through critical masses of volunteers, in-kind donations,and petitions for public funding. However, smaller cities have not been ableto rely on these types of infrastructures (Smith, 2005). A lack of gay com-munity connectedness among some groups in London-Middlesex, then, mayreflect declining infrastructures and services more than it does assimilationinto mainstream society (Weeks, 2007) or an individualist gravitation towardpersonal communities (Holt, 2011).The qualitative evidence suggests that class also mediates the observedhierarchies of perceived acceptance among respondents. For younger gayand bisexual men who are also middle-class, optimistic perceptions of accep-tance may stem from coming of age during the promotion of human rightsprotections for sexual orientation in Canada, insulation within a univer-sity environment, ability to participate in the limited nightlife scene, orassuredness of their ability to move (e.g., to Toronto). For middle-agedgay and bisexual respondents, class status in the form of white-collar jobs,Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 Gay and Bisexual Men’s Perceptions of Acceptance 23dual incomes, or ability to engage in more normative practices (e.g., rais-ing children) may to counteract the overall less optimistic perceptions ofacceptance. Middle-class respondents also seem most able to dismiss, bypass,or circumvent the (under-) development of more inclusive, sustained com-munity infrastructures by socializing in private and traveling elsewhere, whileother groups (e.g., trans men) may remain marginalized.While our study did not compare the survey and interview responseswith those from a big-city referent group (e.g., gay and bisexual men inToronto), our preliminary results suggests that recent advances in gay rightsand mainstream social acceptance may have a mixed effect in smaller andmid-sized cities. As recent interventions have shown (Knopp & Brown, 2003;Lewis, 2013), cultural hierarchies that position large metropolitan, commer-cial gay scenes as the birthplaces and anchors of gay community never trulyapplied to smaller cities such as London. In the 1980s and 1990s, a singlevenue, HALO, fostered an active, self-sustaining gay community. It is onlyin the new milieu of advanced rights, reduced funding for health and socialservices, and the closure of organizations such as HALO, that Toronto—a citywith established LGBT services, networks, and neighborhoods—emerges asthe region’s dominant urban gay community while smaller-city communitiesexperience continued disinvestment and social fragmentation. Incidentally,the relative security of community identity and visibility in Toronto hasspawned both a “post-mo” media discourse that suggests a declining needfor village-based gay venues and the emergence of alternative, non-bar queerspaces as well as trans and people of color spaces (Nash, 2013).London-Middlesex, in contrast, seems to have suffered many of thedrawbacks of the new right-based milieu (e.g., homonormativity and gaycommunity disinvestment) without seeing the supposed benefits, such asvisibilities for more diverse gay and bisexual groups or the development ofa rich array of alternative gay and queer spaces. London and other mid-sizeor small cities might therefore benefit from community centers that offeropportunities for volunteering and networking across identity-based groups.Such centers—even in an online capacity—would offer new health promo-tion opportunities amid persistent perceptions of ASOs as spaces solely forthe HIV-infected (Zablotska, Holt, & Prestage, 2011). Creating such spaces,however, may require public endorsements, funding mechanisms, or public–private partnerships (Lewis, 2013). Meanwhile, groups who are perceived asmost marginalized within the gay community (e.g., trans people, racializedimmigrants) might be included through greater network-building with extantorganizations such as student groups or the local newcomer settlement cen-ter, and through explicitly multicultural and gender-fluid events. Thus, forLondon and potentially other mid-sized cities, narrowing the social cleavagesamong gay and bisexual men may require reframing the form and functionof gay community rather than merely celebrating ascendance to a “post-mo”Downloaded by [86.16.125.39] at 09:35 29 May 2015 24 N. M. Lewis et al.era. More work, therefore, needs to be done to assess whether gay commu-nities are beginning to evolve differently in smaller cities than they are inlarge metropolitan areas.The conclusions drawn in this study, however, must also be consideredin light of several limitations. First, as a small-scale, convenience-samplestudy, the results cannot easily be extrapolated to gay and bisexual menand communities more generally, though it may suggest possibilities forthis larger group. Second, while the inferential statistics used in this studyhighlight gradients in perceived social acceptance among gay and bisexualmen, they cannot be interpreted in the same way as in a larger, random-sample study. This is primarily a descriptive analysis, and the quantitativeanalysis does not provide information as to why differences in perceivedacceptance exist. However, the study’s mixed-methods design overcomessome of this limitation, in allowing more detailed explanation. Third, sincewe queried perceived acceptance for men of color without sexual identitybeing specified, we cannot comment on the acceptance of gay or bisexualmen of color. Fourth, the higher perceived acceptance for all groups withinthe gay community may be due to positive bias stemming from surveyingrespondents who are members of the community they are being asked todescribe. Despite these limitations, the study provides an important pointof departure for monitoring and assessing emerging cleavages in both gaycommunities and gay “equalities,” particularly in mid-sized cities that do notfollow dominant metropolitan narratives of gay advancement.REFERENCESAldrich, R.

Little work, however, has focused on perceived acceptance for subgroups within the gay community or broader society. Using interviews (n = 20) and a survey (n = 202) of gay and bisexual men in a mid-sized Canadian city, we find perceived hierarchies of acceptance for the various subgroups as well as an age effect wherein middle-aged men perceive the least acceptance for all groups. These differences are linked with the uneven impact of social, political, and institutional changes relevant to gay and bisexual men in Canada",
