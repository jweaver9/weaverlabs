Transgender \nindividuals, or individuals whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, are one minority group who may experience gender identity related microaggressions. \nThe current review aimed to explore the nature of microaggressions toward transgender \nindividuals, and appraise any relationship between microaggressions and well-being within \nthis population. A systematic search of ASSIA, CINHAL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, PBSC, \nPsycARTICLES, PsycINFO was conducted in June 2020. Grey literature was identified \nthrough contacting key researchers and through online database searching of unpublished \ndissertations/theses. Reference lists of included papers were examined and forward citation \ncompleted for key papers. 17 papers were quality assessed and included in the narrative \nsynthesis, encompassing a total of 3432 participants. The findings suggest that transgender \nindividuals experience a range of microaggressive acts, across multiple contexts. A number \nof additional variables were noted as important when understanding microaggressions within \nthis population; including the individual’s gender identity, the perpetrator, the mode of \ndelivery, and frequency. Emerging evidence tentatively suggests a relationship between \ngender identity related microaggressions and well-being indicators within this population. In \nparticular, negative cognitive, emotional and behavioural responses were noted. Some studies \nsuggested a relationship between microaggressions and negative mental health outcomes, \nincluding anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. However, these conclusions should \nbe interpreted with caution, given a number of methodological and conceptual gaps within \nthe literature. Nonetheless, subtle forms of prejudice are an important area for research and \nclinical consideration within this population.  \n \n6 \n \nIntroduction \nTransgender individuals are those whose gender identity is incongruent with their sex \nassigned at birth (Vincent, 2018). A spectrum of experiences are generally encompassed by \nthis term including (but not limited to); trans man, trans woman, non-binary, gender fluid, \ngender non-conforming and genderqueer (Vincent, 2018). Cisgender refers to individuals \nwhose gender identity is congruent with their sex assigned at birth (see Appendix 1.2 for full \ndefinitions). Despite growing recognition and moves to de-pathologise trans experiences, \ncisgenderism and transphobia remain widespread worldwide (Coleman et al., 2011; \nBachmann & Gooch, 2018).  \n \nPrejudice and Discrimination \nThe high prevalence of prejudice, discrimination and victimisation towards \ntransgender and gender non-conforming people is well documented (Bachmann & Gooch, \n2018; McCann, 2017). Within Britain, a recent report on LGBT lives concluded that 41% of \ntrans people and 31% of non-binary people report past-year experience of at least one hate \ncrime or incident on the basis of their gender identity or expression alone (Bachmann & \nGooch, 2018). The Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003) has been adapted and applied to \ncapture the stigma-related experiences within the transgender population (Hendricks & Testa, \n2012). This framework posits that minority groups (e.g. trans individuals) experience chronic \nstress resulting from hostile social situations, which has a negative impact on well-being. \nMore specifically, distal (or ‘external’) stressors (e.g. discrimination, prejudice, victimisation, \nhate crimes) are highlighted as predisposing minorities to further proximal (or ‘internal’) \nstressors (e.g. rumination, expectation of future discrimination/victimisation, hypervigilance, \ninternalised transphobia, concealment) (Meyer, 2003; Hendricks & Testa, 2012).  \n7 \n \n \nTransgender individuals are at disproportionate risk of adverse mental health outcomes \ncompared to cisgender individuals including; depression (Borgogna, McDermott, Aita & \nKridel, 2019), anxiety (Borgogna, et al., 2019), self-harm (Marshall et al., 2016), suicidality \n(Marshall et al., 2016; Wolford-Clevenger, Cannon, Flores, Smith & Stuart, 2017), and \nsubstance misuse (Glynn & Berg, 2017). The relationship between minority stressors and \npsychological distress within the trans population has been extensively noted (McCann & \nBrown, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx, & Katz, 2006). Minority stressors such as prejudice, \ndiscrimination and perceived lack of social support have also been noted as correlates of both \nnon-suicidal self-injury and suicidality within the trans population (Wolford-Clevenger, \nFrantell, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018). One growing field of research examining how \ndistinct forms of prejudice and discrimination are experienced by minority groups, and their \nimpact on overall well-being, is that which explores microaggressive acts (or \nmicroaggressions). \n \nUnderstanding Microaggressions \nSometimes referred to as ‘everyday discriminations’; microaggressions are described \nas subtle verbal, behavioural or environmental communications which express bias, prejudice \nor discrimination toward marginalised groups (Sue et al., 2007; Sue 2010).  Microaggressions \ncan be either intentional or unintentional, although they are often conceptualised as being \ndistinct from overt forms of discrimination in that the perpetrator is often unaware of the \nunderlying hostile expression or potential for harm (Sue, 2010). Microaggressions are also \noften subjective, subtle and ambiguous in nature and thus can be challenging to identify \n(Friedlaender, 2018). Research is yet to explore how microaggressions develop. However, \n8 \n \nthese acts are generally understood in three categories; microinsults, microinvalidations and \nmicroassaults (Sue, 2010).  \n \nMicroinsults (e.g. “that’s so gay!”) are communications that convey a negative stereotype \ntoward a specific group, whilst microinvalidations (e.g. “all lives matter!”) are described as \ncommunications which nullify or dismiss the lived experience of a marginalised group. \nMicroassaults (e.g. displaying a Nazi symbol) are often conscious and explicit \ncommunications of a negative attitude or bias toward a marginalised group, and of the three \nare described as most similar to blatant, overt forms of prejudice and discrimination (Sue, \n2010).  \n \nMicroaggressions and Psychological Well-being \nMicroaggressions may have a different impact on the well-being of minority groups \ncompared to other forms of discrimination. Perceived discriminations are considered to be \nmore harmful to psychological well-being if they are conceptualised as being pervasive and \nsystemic in nature, as opposed to infrequent or isolated events (Schmitt, Branscombe, \nPostmes & Garcia, 2014), due to their impact on an individual’s felt sense of control and \nexperience of rejection and social exclusion (Schmitt, et al., 2014; Wirth & Williams, 2009). \nMicroaggressions are one form of perceived discrimination that may be particularly pervasive \nin nature due to difficulties in both identifying and effectively challenging them (Sue et al., \n2007). For example, as microaggressions reinforce social hierarchies, Williams (2020) argues \nthat identified microaggressions often go unchallenged due to the power imbalance between \nparties. Furthermore, given that microaggressions are predominantly described as \n9 \n \nunintentional, this can lead to difficulties in challenging these acts as perpetrators may \nstruggle to engage in meaningful discourse that explores their implicit bias (Nadal et al., \n2011; DiAngelo, 2011; Friedlaender, 2018; Williams, 2020). DiAngelo (2011) argues that \nindividuals who challenge racial microaggressions are often met with hostility, defensiveness, \nand further microaggressions.  \n \nThe majority of literature exploring microaggressions and their consequences has focused on \nracial and ethnical microaggressions, and concluded that microaggressions represent a health \nand mental health risk to racial and ethnic minorities. Racial microaggressions have been \nfound to be significantly correlated with both depressive symptoms and higher negative affect \n(Nadal, Griffin, Wong, Hamit, Rasmus, 2014), lower self-esteem (Nadal, Wong, Griffin, \nDavidoff, & Sriken, 2014), and poor psychological well-being (Solorzano, Ceja & Yosso, \n2000). Blume, Lovato, Thyken and Denny (2012) highlighted the relationship between \nmicroaggressions and both binge drinking and anxiety symptoms among racial and ethnic \nminority students within predominantly white Colleges.  \n \nMore recently, a growing body of research has explored microaggressions toward other \nmarginalised groups including; people with disabilities (Keller & Galgay, 2010; Conover, \nIsrael & Nylund-Gibson, 2017), people with ill mental health (Gonzales, Davidoff, Nadal, \nYanos, 2015), women (Nadal, Hamit, Lyons, Weinberg & Corman, 2013), marginalised  \nreligious groups (Nadal, Griffin, Hamit, Leon, Tobio, Rivera, 2012), people who have been \nadopted (Garber & Grotevant, 2015), and LGBTQ individuals (Nadal, Whitman, Davis, \nErazo & Davidoff, 2016).  \n \n10 \n \nNadal et al., (2016) completed a literature review aimed at providing an overview of existing \nknowledge of microaggressions towards LGBTQ individuals, and highlighted a wide range of \nmicroaggressive acts experienced by this minority group. The authors also noted evidence \nthat transgender individuals experience gender identity related microaggressions, however \nhighlighted that their experiences were often incorporated alongside those of LGBQ \nindividuals within existing literature. Gender identity microaggressions refer to those which \nexpress subtle prejudice or discrimination toward transgender individuals due to their gender \nidentity being incongruent with their sex assigned at birth. It is recognised that some \ntransgender individuals may also experience sexual orientation microaggressions, however \namalgamating gender identity and sexual orientation minority groups (i.e. LGBTQ) may also \nlimit our ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding trans-specific gender identity related \nmicroaggressions.  \n \nReview objectives \nThe current review is the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to systematically \nidentify and evaluate the current empirical literature existing around gender identity related \nmicroaggressions, well-being, and the transgender population. The review’s main aims are to; \ni) explore the nature of gender identity related microaggressive acts toward transgender \npeople, and ii) explore and determine the evidence of the relationship between these \nmicroaggressions and well-being within the transgender population.  \n \n \n \n11 \n \nMethod \nThe review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses (PRISMA). The proposed procedures were preregistered with PROSPERO \nInternational Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019160392)(Appendix \n1.3). \n \nSearch Strategy \nScoping searches were completed to determine the feasibility of the research \nquestions. No previous systematic reviews were identified, however key papers that provided \nan overview of the literature were noted (Nadal et al., 2016; Chang & Chung, 2015). \nDatabases included for electronic searching were chosen based on relevance for the research \naims and included: ASSIA, CINHAL, COCHRANE, EMBASE, Psychology & Behavioural \nSciences, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO. The final systematic searches were conducted on \n19/06/2020.  Searches were limited to papers published in English.  \n \nThe search strategy was guided by previous reviews which have examined experiences of \ntransgender individuals and/or microaggressions (Wolford-Clevenger, et al., 2018; Lui & \nQuezada, 2019). Key literature was also searched for alternative key terms (Nadal et al., \n2016; Chang & Chung 2015). A subject librarian was consulted on the development of the \nsearch strategy. Keywords and indexing terms (MeSH and thesaurus terms) using various \ncombinations included: transgender*, transexual*, female-to-male, male-to-female, \nandrogyn*, TGNC, transmasculine, transman, transmen, transwom*, transfeminine, gender \nnon-conform*, gender minority, gender variant, genderqueer, gender diverse, bigender*, \nagender*, two-spirit*, genderfluid, gender neutral, non-binary, LGBT*, microaggressi*, \nmicroinsult*, microassault*, microinvalidat*, subtle discriminat*, covert discriminat*, \n12 \n \nimplicit bias, implicit prejudice, subtle prejudice, covert prejudice. See Appendix 1.4–1.10 \nfor full search results.   \n \nTo improve the sensitivity of the search strategy, forward citation searches of key articles in \nthe area (Nadal et al., 2016; Chang & Chung, 2015) were also examined using Scopus and \nthe reference lists of included studies were hand searched for relevant papers. Grey literature \nwas included to increase the data pool and reduce publication bias. Grey literature was \nidentified through; i) contacting key researchers in the area (via ResearchGate), ii) online \ndatabase searching of unpublished dissertations/theses (The British Library grey literature for \nMedical Sciences, ProQuest), and iii) through general search engines (e.g. Google). In \ninstances where a piece of grey literature and a later published piece were both identified, the \npeer-reviewed article only was included. \n \nEligibility Criteria \nStudies were included if: i) participants were transgender (defined as people whose \ngender identity differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were \nassigned), ii) microaggressions (subtle verbal, behavioural or environmental communications \nwhich express prejudice or discrimination toward marginalised groups) were the phenomena \nof interest, iii) the outcome of interest was how microaggressions are experienced by trans \npeople and/or relationship with any well-being indicators, and iv) the study was of \nqualitative, quantitative or mixed-method design. Studies were excluded if: i) the full-text \nwas not available in English and ii) if trans-specific experiences were not described \nseparately from the overarching LGBT group.   \n \n \n13 \n \nData Selection \nThe search yielded 1650 results, of which 441 were duplicates (figure 1). The author \nscreened the titles and abstracts against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, of which 1163 were \nnot relevant to this review. The full-text of 46 studies were reviewed and of these 29 were \nexcluded because they: i) did not focus specifically on microaggressions or looked at \nprejudice in general (10 studies), ii) did not describe trans-specific experiences separately \nfrom LGBT group (10 studies), iii) did not include a transgender sample (2 studies), iv) the \nfull text was not available (2 studies), v) were a review/article (4 studies), or was an earlier \nversion (grey literature) of an included peer-reviewed article (1 study). A total of 17 studies \nwere identified for inclusion.   \n \n \n \n  \n14 \n \nFigure 1 – PRISMA Flow Diagram \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n15 \n \nData Extraction \nA data extraction tool (Appendix 1.11) was developed, based on the tool used by \nZortea, Gray, & O’Connor (2019), to standardise the process of identifying relevant \ninformation from each article.  \nQuality Assessment \nThe quality of selected studies was systematically assessed using the Crowe Critical \nAppraisal Tool (CCAT) (Crowe, 2013) (Appendix 1.12), which allows for appraisal across \nmultiple research designs and has established construct validity (Crowe & Sheppard, 2011). \nThe tool consists of eight categories on reporting and methodological issues including; \npreliminaries, introduction, design, sampling, data collection, ethical matters, results and \ndiscussion. A total score for each category is obtained (6-point scale; 0-5), and a further total \nscore (%) is obtained for each paper. Prior to appraisal, it was determined that for the purpose \nof quality rating a total score of 0-50% would be considered poor, 51-75% moderate, and 76-\n100% good. A second researcher independently rated a number of papers (23.5% or n=4) to \nreduce risk of bias. Inter-rater reliability for the categories was moderate (Cohen’s Kappa = \n0.5)(McHugh, 2012); all category scores (0-5) were within 1 point. There was no \ndisagreement between any study quality overall (poor/moderate/good). Discussion took place \nuntil agreement on ratings was reached.  \n \nData Synthesis \nGroup-level data were synthesized using an integrative narrative synthesis. This \napproach was chosen due to the inclusion of diverse study designs/aims and the resulting \nheterogeneity of data. In line with recommended guidance (Popay et al., 2006), a number of \n16 \n \nkey principles were adhered to and included: i) a synthesis of included studies, to give a \nnarrative overview of what research exists on microaggressions toward trans people, ii) an \nexploration of the relationship within and between studies, looking at how microaggressions \nare experienced by trans people and the nature of the relationship with general well-being and \nmicroaggressions within this population, and iii) a critical reflection and assessment of the \nrobustness of the review. For ease of expression, studies are first numbered within the results \n(see Table 1) and referred to as such throughout the synthesis. Individual authors/author \nteams are then used within the discussion. \n \nResults \nThe results of this systematic narrative review represent the key insights and findings \nfrom the current literature existing around microaggressions toward transgender populations, \nas detailed in Table 1.  \n \nQuality Appraisal of Studies \nThe levels of quality were critiqued using the CCAT, with only 17.6% (n=3) of \nstudies rated as ‘good’ (see Table 2). As per CCAT guidance, the ratings for each of the 8 \ncategories for each paper are reported (see Appendix 1.13). Only one of the 17 studies was \nrated as having a high quality design (study 5), while the majority had a moderate design \n(n=13). Almost half of the studies (n=8) were rated as poor in relation to ethical matters. \nReported effect sizes, where applicable, are noted in Appendix 1.15. \n \n \n17 \n \n \nStudy Characteristics \nSeventeen articles were eligible for inclusion; eight qualitative (studies 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, \n13, 14, and 15), four quantitative (studies 3, 9, 12, and 16), and five mix-method studies \n(studies 1, 4, 5, 11, 17). All studies were of cross-sectional design. Only one of the studies \nused a control group (matched, randomised) to compare outcomes in presence/no presence of \nmicroaggressions (study 1). Fifteen articles were published in peer-reviewed journals (studies \n2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17) and two were unpublished grey literature \n(studies 1 and 5). All included studies were completed in the past decade, with over half \n(n=9) being completed within the past two years. All studies originated from the USA (n=14) \nor both the USA and Canada (n=3). Across the studies, microaggressions were loosely \ndefined as subtle, verbal, behavioural or environmental indignities that communicate hostility \nor discrimination toward trans individuals, in line with Sue (2010) definition of racial \nmicroaggressions. Study 7 provided a taxonomy of transgender microaggressions which \nmany of the studies used as frameworks for their interview schedule/survey or to interpret \ntheir findings (see Appendix 1.14 for full details of taxonomy).  \n \nSample Characteristics \n Two of the mixed-method articles retained the same sample across each study \ncomponent (studies 1 and 4). Two mixed-method articles from one author team included the \nsame study as their qualitative component (studies 11 and 12) and so these qualitative results \nand sample are only discussed once.

Findings relating to a relationship between \nmicroaggressions and well-being within the trans population are then explored. \n \nContent of Microaggressions \nA total of 10 studies specifically aimed to explore and describe the content of gender \nidentity microaggressions experienced by transgender individuals (studies 2, 7, 5, 6, 10, 11, \n13, 14, 15, and 17). Three of these 10 studies highlighted that microaggressions experienced \nmay differ in terms of content between different trans identities (studies 7, 13, and 14).  \n \nInterpersonal microaggressions included; use of transphobic language (study 7), \nmisgendering or misuse of pronouns (studies 2, 6, 7, 10, and 13), assumption of universal \ntransgender experience (study 7), exoticization/tokenisation (studies 6, 7, 10, and 13), \ndiscomfort/disapproval of transgender experience (studies 2, 7, and 15), endorsement of \ngendernormative and binary expectations/behaviours (studies 2, 7, 14, and 15), denial of \nexistence of transphobia (study 7), assumption of psychopathology or sexual abnormality \n(studies 7 and 11), physical threat/harassment (study 7), denial of individual transphobia \n(study 7), denial of bodily privacy (studies 7 and 11), transgender identity-denying or non-\naffirming communications (i.e. those that question, minimise or dismiss the authenticity of \ntransgender individuals identities) (studies 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15), involuntary gender \ndisclosure/violation of privacy or public questioning of identity (studies 2, 11, and 13), \n \n25 \n \npassive rejection within social contexts based on gender identity or presentation (inc. within \nrelationships were gender identity was accepted in private contexts) (studies 2, 13, 14, and \n15), failing to correct transphobia (study 14), and overemphasis on gender identity (study 6).  \n \nSystemic and environmental microaggressions found included;  non-inclusive binary forms \n(studies 2 and 17), difficulty accessing of safe and inclusive bathrooms (studies 2, 7, and 17), \nabsence of protocols that allow for the use of gender-inclusive language (study 2), lack of \ncompetence/knowledge regarding transgender issues within systems (studies 2 and 6), \nabsence of gender-inclusive housing on campuses (study 17), gatekeeping to health services \n(study 6), non-affirming policies and practices within systems (i.e. workplaces, healthcare, \ncriminal justice, barriers to changing legal documents) (studies 7 and 10). \n \nOne quantitative study (study 9) used qualitative data from a previous study (study 7), to \ncompile and initial pilot a quantitative measure of transgender microaggressions; the Gender \nIdentity Microaggressions Scale-Initial (GIMS-Initial). The validity across five subscales \n(denial of gender identity, misuse of pronouns, invasion of bodily privacy, behavioural \ndiscomfort and denial of societal transphobia) was strong (Cronbach’s alpha =.76), however \nmethodological limitations applied. \n \nContext in which Microaggressions Occur \nMicroaggressions are experienced across various interpersonal and environmental \ncontexts. Nine studies in this review investigated microaggressive experiences in general \neveryday situations (studies 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 16). A total of four studies found \n \n26 \n \nmicroaggressions are experienced within close interpersonal relationships; including within \nclose friendships (studies 4 and 13) and within romantic relationships (studies 14 and 15). \nOne study found that transgender individuals experience microaggressions within therapeutic \nrelationships (study 6). Three studies found microaggressions occur within education and \nacademic settings (studies 2, 10, and 17), however the scope and aims of these studies varied. \nTwo of these studies described student’s experiences; one found that interpersonal and \nenvironmental microaggressions were experienced in Social Work programmes (study 2) and \none found evidence of environmental microaggressions within Colleges in general (study 17). \nThe third study found that microaggressions are experienced by trans academics in their \nworkplaces (study 10).   \n \nFrequency and Intensity of Microaggressions \nMicroaggressions experienced by trans individuals in general are diverse in both \ncontent and context. Similarly, a number of studies also discussed variations in the frequency \nof trans-specific microaggressions (studies 1, 4, and 12). Two studies investigated factors \nassociated with the frequency by which a transgender individual may experience \nmicroaggressions (study 4 and 12). Lower income and lower level of self-reported degree of \n‘passing’ were associated with increased frequency of experienced nonaffirming \nmicroaggressions (on average, per week), whilst older age was associated with lower \nfrequency (study 12). Adolescents (aged 14-16) may experience the highest frequency of \nmicroaggressions, whilst race/ethnicity was not associated with frequency (study 12). \nInterpersonal microaggressions are experienced more frequently by trans people within their \nfriendships with cisgender and heterosexual people, followed by cisgender LGBTQ \nfriendships, and lastly (and least frequently) within friendships with other trans individuals \n \n27 \n \n(study 4). Notably, over a third (36%) of a control group of trans individuals who were asked \nto recall the Wednesday of the previous week (as opposed to experimental group who were \nasked to recall a microaggression) also described experiencing at least one microaggressive \nact (study 1). \n \nFive included studies suggested that the intensity of emotional responses to microaggressions \nmay differ based on the perpetrator (studies 4, 13, 14, and 15) and method of delivery (study \n11). Interpersonal microaggressions are described as more hurtful when the aggressor was \nconsidered a close friend (studies 4 and 13) or a romantic partner (studies 14 and 15). \nMoreover, self-reported intensity of negative affect is higher in response to interpersonal \nmicroaggressions when the friend/aggressor is considered to have a similar gender \nidentity/sexual identity to the victim (study 4). Two studies found that media based non-\naffirming microaggressions (both traditional and social media) evoke higher emotional \nresponses than interpersonal events (study 5 and 11). Types of microaggressions \n(microinvalidations and microinsults vs microassaults), although notably hard to categorise, \nmay vary in their impact on feelings of social exclusion (study 1).  \n \nRelationship between Microaggressions and Well-being \nA number of studies aimed to qualitatively explore and described consequences of \nexperiencing microaggressions. Five studies noted various emotional responses including; \nbetrayal (studies 4 and 8), distress (studies 8 and 17), hopelessness and exhaustion (studies 5, \n8 and 11), rejection (study 4), feeling invalidated and misunderstood (studies 4, 8, and 17), \ndisappointment (study 4), feeling uncomfortable (studies 4 and 17), feeling worn \n \n28 \n \ndown/apathetic (study 11), empathy for other trans individuals (study 5). Four studies noted \nbehavioural responses including; direct confrontation (study 8), indirect confrontation \n(studies 8 and 10), passive coping (studies 4, 8 and 11) and adaptive/creative responses (e.g.  \nactivism) (study 17). One study noted cognitive responses including; rationalisation, double \nbind/‘balancing act’ and, vigilance and self-preservation (study 8). Two studies discussed \nchanges to interpersonal functioning including; withdrawal from social interaction (study 11), \nand distance within or ending of interpersonal relationships (study 4). Although not \nspecifically investigated, a further five qualitative studies touched on negative emotional \n(studies 2, 6, 13, 14, and 15), behavioural (study 6), and cognitive (study 15) responses to \nexperiencing microaggressive acts within their participants accounts. Similarly, the ending of \ninterpersonal relationships in response was also noted (studies 13 and 14) \n \nA further 6 studies included quantitative measures of the impact of microaggressive acts on \nthe well-being of trans individuals including; self-esteem (study 16), stress (study 16), \nanxiety (study 16), depressive symptoms (studies 5, 11 and 17); suicidality (studies 3, 5, 11 \nand 17) and academic functioning (study 17). Higher levels of microaggressions experienced \nwere associated with lower self-esteem, greater perceived stress and greater anxiety \nsymptoms (study 16). Microaggressions also contributed to feelings of social exclusion (e.g. \nlower relational value, lower satisfaction of basic needs being met, and higher rating of \nostracism)(Study 1). Environmental microaggressions specifically were associated with \npoorer academic development and lower perceptions of social inclusion, but are not \nindependently associated with depressive symptoms (study 17). Two related mixed-method \nstudies conceptualised transgender identity-related stress (or trans-identity defence related \nemotions (TIDE)) (studies 5 and 11). Study 5 describes how trans individuals may need to \ndefend the validity of their identity within the context of societal non-acceptance/experiences \n \n29 \n \nof non-affirming microaggressions, which results in subsequent negative affect and emotional \ncompromise. \n \nIncreased weekly frequency of non-affirming transgender microaggressions (interpersonal \nand media based) are associated with increased odds of past year depressive symptoms, past \nyear suicidal ideation, and life-time suicidality (ideation and attempts) (study 11). In \nparticular, increased frequency of microaggressions which result in weariness or apathy are \nassociated with greater odds of past-year depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (study \n11). Trans individuals with higher transgender identity defence-related emotions (TIDE) \nscores, as a consequence of experiencing non-affirming microaggressions, have higher rates \nof societal disengagement, emotional withdrawal and engagement in suicide-related \nbehaviours (study 5). Interpersonal microaggressions uniquely contribute to lifetime suicide \nattempts for trans youth (when compared to other psychosocial risk factors), but are not \nsignificantly associated with past 6-month suicidal ideation (study 3). Environmental \nmicroaggressions are not associated with suicide attempt (studies 3 and 17), or past 6-month \nsuicidal ideation (study 17). \n \nDiscussion \nThe current review aimed firstly to explore the nature of microaggressive acts toward \ntransgender people. Unsurprisingly, included studies suggest that transgender individuals do \nexperience gender identity related microaggressions across a number of contexts. A second \naim was to explore and determine the evidence of the relationship between microaggressions \nand well-being within the transgender population. Emerging evidence tentatively suggests a \n \n30 \n \nrelationship between microaggressions and well-being, with experiencing microaggressive \nacts as potentially having a negative impact on the well-being of transgender individuals. \nHowever, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, given a number of limitations \nwithin the existing literature base. \n \nNadal et al. (2012) were the first to extend previous literature examining microaggressions \ntoward LGBTQ people to explore trans-specific experiences. Prior to this, our knowledge of \ntransgender individuals’ experiences of microaggressions were amalgamated with sexual \nminority cisgender people’s experiences (Nadal, Rivera, Corpus & Sue, 2010) and thus our \nability to draw accurate conclusions of trans-specific experiences was significantly limited. \nFor transgender individuals, these subtle, everyday communications of discrimination are \ndiverse in content and can be experienced across multiple contexts including within \nfriendships, intimate relationships, therapeutic relationships, workplaces and academic \nsettings. Despite the current findings, our ability to accurately draw conclusions regarding the \nnature of gender identity related microaggressions remains limited for a number of reasons, \nincluding methodological limitations within existing studies and conceptual gaps within \nmicroaggression theory more generally. \n \nTransgender individuals’ experiences are not homogenous; they are informed by a number of \ndifferent factors, such as gender identity, stage of transition, degree of ‘passing’ (i.e. degree \nto which they are perceived by others as the gender they identify with) and assigned sex \n(Chang & Chung, 2015; Levitt and Ippolito, 2014). Chang and Chung (2015) previously \ncautioned that the complexity of transgender identities may influence how microaggressive \nacts are experienced by trans individuals. In line with these concerns, the results suggest \n \n31 \n \nqualitative differences in microaggressions experienced by non-binary and gender non-\nconforming identities when compared to binary identities. Similarly, differences were also \nhighlighted across binary identities (transman/transwoman), and self-reported level of \n‘passing’ was associated with a decreased frequency of microaggressions. Therefore, despite \nseveral included studies seeking to identify and describe microaggressions experienced by the \ntransgender population, our current knowledge of gender identity microaggressions may lack \ndepth due to samples often including a diverse range of transgender identities. Similar \nconcerns have been raised in existing racial microaggression literature, which often does not \naccount for differences in racial groups or variations in visibility of minority status (Derthick, \nDavid, Saw and Okazaki, 2014). It is recognised that inclusive transgender research which \nencompasses the range of gendered experiences is imperative; however future studies should \nalso hold in mind the heterogeneity of transgender identities when considering their \nsampling. \n \nThe vast majority of the research literature adding to our understanding of trans \nmicroaggressions comes from qualitative methodologies, which facilitate the gathering of \nrich insights into individuals’ lived experiences and how they make sense of particular \nphenomena (Hammarberg, Kirkman, & Lacey, 2016). Nonetheless, these methods are not \nwithout limitations, such as relying on participants self-report and researcher’s own \ninterpretations which can both be subject to bias. For example, included studies often first \nprovided participants with definitions of microaggressions before asking for their experiences \nof such and their emotional reactions, thus automatically confirming the studied \nphenomenon. Alternatively, researchers interpreted participants’ accounts of general lived \nexperiences in line with a definition of microaggressions held in mind. However, this latter \napproach then relies further on the researchers’ own assumptions of what those experiences \n \n32 \n \nentailed for both the individual and the perpetrator. Microaggressions are complex and \nsubjective in nature: what one individual may appraise as a microaggressive act, others may \nnot, thus they may not experience similar reactions or responses. The subjectivity of \nmicroaggressions in general may exacerbate these methodological limitations, inherently \nmaking it a challenging area of research (Lilienfeld, 2017). \n \nLilienfeld (2017) cautioned that due to substantial research exploring racial microaggressions \nand their impact, that subsequent areas of research within minority populations may assume \nmore construct validity than current literature would suggest. One conceptual gap within \nmicroaggressions literature in general is discerning microaggressive acts, particularly \nmicroassaults, from overt prejudice (Lilienfeld, 2017; Wong et al., 2014). Certainly, at times \nincluded studies described microaggressions which could be conveyed as more overt forms of \nprejudice and discrimination: Pitcher (2017) for example, described trans academics being \nfired for their trans status within participants accounts. Similarly, Morris et al., (2020) \ndescribed overt hostility from clinicians and mental health services being unable to meet trans \nindividuals needs as microaggressions. AuBuchon and colleagues (2019) were unable to \nreliably code participant’s accounts of transgender microaggressive experiences into the three \ndistinct types of microaggressions: microassaults, microinvalidations and microinsults (Sue, \n2010) due theoretical similarities and common co-occurrence. Included studies tended to \nfocus instead on overarching interpersonal and environmental categories of microaggressions.  \n \nWith regard to well-being, emerging evidence suggest a relationship between \nmicroaggressions and negative well-being outcomes within the transgender population. \nNegative emotional, behavioural, and cognitive responses to microaggressions were noted \n \n33 \n \nthroughout included studies, in addition to negative mental health outcomes including \nincreased anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidality. Microaggressions may also disrupt \nsocial support and academic learning. These findings are in line with existing research \nexploring the impact of microaggressions within other minority groups (Parr & Howe, 2019; \nNadal et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). Some adaptive coping strategies in \nresponse were also reported, such as becoming involved in activism. A number of variables \nwere also indicated as important to consider when evaluating the impact of microaggressions \non well-being, such as aggressor, frequency, method of delivery (e.g. media vs interpersonal), \nand type of emotional response (e.g. defence-related stress/emotions). However the \naforementioned complexities of defining and measuring microaggressions remain, and again \nlimit our ability to draw definitive conclusions.  \n \nAdditionally, it remains unclear how transgender microaggressions differ from, or may fit \nwithin, other models of discrimination or minority stress. Howe (2019) concluded that \nmicroaggressions that deny that trans people exist (gender identity non-affirming \nmicroaggressions), described as an emotional trauma, should be considered a specific \nminority stressor within the minority stress model (Meyer, 2003). However further research is \nrequired to support these findings. Similarly, the processes which may mediate any \nrelationship between microaggressions and well-being or mental health outcomes remains \nlargely unknown. \n \n \n \n \n34 \n \nMethodological Limitations and Recommendations for Future Research \nThe discussion above has pointed to a number of methodological limitations which \nfuture research should seek to minimise, including the potential for bias within study designs, \nthe amalgamation of trans identities with samples, and conceptual gaps in how \nmicroaggressions are defined and measured. The current review did not identify any validated \nquantitative measures of microaggressions with the trans population. Nadal et al. (2018) did \nhowever pilot a measure (the GIMS), although notably this is based on the findings from a \nstudy with a number of methodological limitations (Nadal et al., 2012) and further research is \nrequired to fully investigate the reliability and validity of this measure. \n \nAll of the studies originated in the USA or Canada and so it unclear how they may generalise \nworldwide. Similarly, individuals of white ethnicity and those with binary gender identities \nwere over-represented across the studies. Samples were mainly from online LGBT groups, \nwhere participants may have had more access to support and resources to understand or cope \nwith microaggressions. There remain important areas yet to be explored, such as \nmicroaggressions with family contexts and healthcare settings, or preferred coping \nmechanisms. Longitudinal studies may help identify the cumulative effects of \nmicroaggressions or their impact over time.  \n \nReview Limitations \nThe current review is the first to systematically explore and synthesise the existing \nliterature examining microaggressions within the transgender population, and thus a wide \nscope of studies with varying experimental designs and aims were included. However this \n \n35 \n \nthen presented a challenge of synthesising and describing diverse results from mixed-\nmethods literature. Therefore our ability to describe the results in detail, beyond a narrative, \nwas limited. Similarly, the inclusion of multiple gender identities across the included papers \nalso limits the generalisability of the results and conclusions discussed within the current \nreview. \n \nMicroaggressions are a relatively new concept and so there are potentially a number of \nstudies which the search strategy would not have identified due to the authors not defining \nthe explored experiences as subtle prejudice or microaggressions. For example, studies \nexploring the impact of individuals not using a trans persons chosen name could perhaps be \nconsidered, in line with the concept of microaggressions, as describing the impact of a \nspecific non-affirming interpersonal microaggression. It is recognised that individuals can \nhave multiple minority identities, although the current review did not explore intersectional \nmicroaggressions that transgender people may experience.  \n \nClinical Implications \n Clinicians should be aware of how they themselves may express microaggressions \ntowards transgender individuals and utilise their own supervision structures to explore and \nreflect on their own implicit biases. Due to the power differences that maintain \nmicroaggressions and the negative impact that challenging these may have on minority \nindividuals, clinicians should aim to explore and correct any microaggressive \nacts/communications they witness. In general, transgender individuals and their needs \nshouldn’t be unfamiliar to those providing care; clinical services should be staffed by \nindividuals who have a clear understanding of the lived experiences of transgender \nindividuals and how forms of prejudice, including microaggressions, can impact on their \n \n36 \n \nwell-being and mental health outcomes. Discussing microaggressive experiences during \nassessment may help to identify important risk factors, particularly given the suggested \nrelationship between microaggressions and suicidality.  \n \nSystemic and environmental microaggressions are likely to be encountered within wider \nhealthcare and education systems. Action should be taken at a systemic level to not only \nreduce these everyday experiences (e.g. use of trans-affirmative and gender-inclusive \nlanguage within practice (i.e. people who menstruate), removal of gender-binary forms, \naccess to comfortable bathrooms), but actively promote the rights of transgender individuals \n(e.g. increased access to gender-affirming healthcare, providing trans-inclusive education and \ntraining, transgender voices represented throughout healthcare and within decision making \nroles, funding further clinical research). Wider policy reform that challenges prejudice and \ndiscrimination towards trans individuals will help to maintain momentum towards trans-\ninclusive systems, particularly in the face of cisgender individuals who continue to use their \nposition of privilege and wide reaching platforms to express and ‘legitimise’ prejudice \ntowards the transgender population.  \n \nConclusions \nThe current review suggests transgender individuals may experience a wide array of \nmicroaggressions, across a number of interpersonal and environmental contexts. Emerging \nevidence of a relationship between microaggressions and negative consequences for well-\nbeing was noted. However, these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, due to \nlimitations within included studies and gaps within existing literature. Despite this, it is \n \n37 \n \nimportant to continue to draw attention to and investigate subtle, implicit forms of prejudice \nwithin psychological research. The relevance of this research within the trans population is \nclear. In light of increasing visibility of transgender people within society and subsequent \n‘debate’ around transgender individuals’ (human) rights, this research becomes increasingly \nimperative. Therefore future studies should seek to address the discussed limitations within \nexisting literature, in order to increase scientific rigour and confidence in the validity of \nfindings. In turn, this will lead to increasingly robust policy and clinical practice \nrecommendations aimed at improved outcomes for trans individuals.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n38 \n \nReferences  \n(*Included studies) \n \n* AuBuchon, Stephanie M., \"Exploring Microaggressions Among Trans Populations: Effects \non Feelings of Social Exclusion\" (2019).

Transgender individuals are at a much higher risk of \nsuicidality and self-harm than the general population.  Suicidality refers to thoughts about \nending one’s life, plans to do so, and actual attempts. Self-harm refers to self-inflicted \ndamage to one’s body, which is not related to a desire to end one’s own life.  For many, self-\nharm is a means to help cope with difficult emotions.   \n \nAim: This study aimed to explore transgender peoples’ experiences of self-harm and \nsuicidality, and how they make sense of these experiences. We sought to uncover factors \nwhich may contribute to, or decrease, risk of self-harm and suicidality among transgender \npeople. We also hoped to expand our understanding of how transgender people seek help \nwhen experiencing suicidal distress. \n \nMethod: A small number of transgender adults (n=4), who report a history of self-harm or \nsuicidality, took part in semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Interviews were recorded, \ntranscribed and then analysed.  \n \nResults: Various patterns emerged in participants’ accounts of their lives. Participants spoke \nabout early relationships and experiences that increased their self-harm and suicidal distress, \nand the motives underlying these thoughts and behaviours. Some participants reported that \ntheir self-harm and suicidal distress reduced as the strategies that they found helpful to cope, \nincreased. However additional stressors, such as prejudice and discrimination, continued to \nthreaten participants’ psychological well-being and may reduce the likelihood that they will \nseek help when experiencing suicidal distress. \n \n51 \n \nConclusion: Participants described a range of patterns and experiences across various stages \nof their lives. These important insights may help inform risk management and clinical \ninterventions.  \n \n  \n \n52 \n \nAbstract \nPurpose: Transgender individuals are substantially more likely to report self-harm and \nsuicidality than both cisgender individuals and other LGBT individuals. The psychosocial \nfactors underlying self-harm and suicidality within the trans population, and how they may \nlead to suicidal ideation or attempts, remain largely under-researched. Protective factors, such \nas resilience and help-seeking may help to reduce risk of suicide within the trans population, \nhowever further research is required to examine these processes. Similarly, exploring trans-\nspecific experiences of help-seeking for suicidal distress is important when considering \nsuicide prevention. Further empirical research, aimed at improving our understanding and \nprevention of suicide within this population, is imperative. \n \nMethod:  A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with \ntransgender adults (n=4) in Scotland, who reported a history of self-harm and/or suicidality. \nInterviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). \n \nResults: Four superordinate themes emerged, each with inter-related subordinate themes. 1) \n“Early Experiences”: How individuals made sense of early experiences which increased their \nself-harm and suicidal distress. 2) “Intent”: The motives underlying participants’ self-harm \nand suicidality. 3) “Hope and Resilience”: The protective resilience factors that reduced \nparticipants’ self-harm and suicidal distress. 4) “Threats to Resilience”: How participants \nmade sense of additional minority stressors that were relevant to their experiences. \n \n \n53 \n \nConclusion: The current study suggests that transgender individuals may experience \npsychosocial factors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of \ntheir lives. Important insights into the motivations underlying self-harm and suicidality for \ntransgender individuals emerged. Clinical implications are discussed, however further \nresearch is required to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender \ncommunity.  \n  \n \n54 \n \nIntroduction \nTransgender (or ‘trans’) people are individuals whose sense of felt gender (i.e. gender \nidentity) differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were assigned \n(Vincent, 2018). The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at \nbirth reflects their gender identity (see Appendix 1.2 for full definitions). Research has \nconsistently shown that trans individuals are more at risk of suicide than those from the \ncisgender population (Adams, Hitomi & Moody, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx and Katz, \n2006; Haas, Rodgers & Herman, 2014; McNeil, Ellis & Eccles 2017; Peterson, Matthews, \nCopps-Smith & Conard, 2017). Trans individuals are also more likely to attempt suicide than \nLesbian, Gay, and Bisexual individuals (Haas et al., 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013).  \n \nOne UK trans mental health survey (McNeil, Bailey, Ellis, Morton & Regan, 2012) noted that \nthe majority of respondents (84%) indicated current or historical suicidal ideation, with 48% \nof these individuals having attempted suicide at least once. Similarly, Virupaksha, Muralidhar \nand Ramakrishna (2016) found lifetime rates of suicide attempts within the trans population \nto be between 32% and 52% globally. These prevalence rates are substantially higher than the \ncross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation (9.2%) and attempts (2.7%) within the \ngeneral population (Nock et al., 2008). A higher prevalence of self-harm also exists within \nthe trans population (between 19% and 39%), compared to the cis population (Marshall et al., \n2016). A history of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts are known risk factors \nof dying by suicide within the general population (Chan et al., 2016). However, the lifetime \nprevalence of trans individuals dying by suicide is currently unknown (Wolford-Clevenger, \nCannon, Flores, Smith & Stuart, 2017), largely due to challenges in recording trans identities \nat the time of death (McNeil et al., 2017).  \n \n \n55 \n \nAlthough research within the transgender population has increased in recent years, this \npopulation remains vastly understudied (Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2017). The high rates of \nself-harm and suicidality among trans people highlights the importance of continued research \nwithin this area, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this \npopulation.  \n \nCorrelates of Self-harm and Suicidality \nA systematic review by McNeil et al. (2017) summarised the correlates of suicidal \nideation and behaviours within the trans population. Environmental factors, specifically those \nrelated to minority stressors (e.g. discrimination, victimisation and social stigma), were \nidentified as strongly related to suicidal ideation and attempts. Individual factors, such as co-\nmorbid mental health difficulties and internalised transphobia, were also discussed as risk \nfactors for ideation and attempts. Similar risk factors have been described for self-harm \namong trans people, including discrimination, perceived lack of social support and \ninterpersonal problems (Marshall et al., 2016). The relationship between self-harm and \nsuicidality within the trans population requires further attention; however research suggests a \npositive correlation between self-harm and suicide attempt history (Wolford-Clevenger, \nFrantell, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018).  \n \nKlonsky & May (2015) proposed the ideation-to-action framework, which provides a \ntheoretical stance for understanding suicidality and suggests that suicidal ideation and \nattempts have distinct but related pathways. McNeil et al. (2017) did not review correlates of \nsuicidal ideation and attempts separately thus likely limiting our ability to consider clinical \nimplications. Therefore Wolford-Clevenger et al. (2018) systematically reviewed and \ndescribed separately the correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts within the trans \n \n56 \n \npopulation. Guided by the ideation-to-action framework (Klonsky & May, 2015), the authors \ndescribed a number of internal and external minority stress experiences (e.g. \nprejudice/discrimination, victimisation, expectations of rejection, self-stigma) which, in \ncombination, potentially contribute to psychological pain and thus drive suicidal ideation. In \nparallel with the general suicide literature, a positive correlation was found between suicide \nattempt history and fearsome and painful events among trans people. These events include \nboth physical and sexual violence, substance misuse and, as discussed, self-harm. However, \nin contrast with our understanding that key fearful and physically painful events shift ideation \ntoward attempts, internalised minority stressors were also positively correlated with a move \nfrom ideation to action for trans people.  \n \nNotably, this review highlighted the poor methodological quality of research within this area, \ncautioning that any conclusions drawn regarding the correlates of suicidality in trans people \nshould be considered tentatively. The authors noted that further research efforts are needed to \nunderstand the factors which may contribute to a shift from suicidal ideation toward action \namong transgender people, particularly when considering the generalisation of existing \nsuicide theoretical frameworks to this population. The review highlighted that future \nqualitative research may help to illuminate these factors, which may encompass a range of \nuniquely trans-specific experiences. \n \nSuicide Prevention \nUnderstanding psychosocial protective factors, including resilience and help-seeking \nbehaviours is important for suicide prevention. Resilience refers to the process whereby an \nindividual is able to adaptively respond to and cope with adversity (Windle, 2011), and \nrecognition has been given to its role in helping individuals ‘bounce back’ from minority \n \n57 \n \nstressors that threaten their psychological well-being (Meyer, 2015). Literature has \nhighlighted enhanced internal and external resilience strategies that transgender people may \ndevelop in response to cumulative adversity, including reframing of challenges, defining \none’s own gender and collective self-esteem (Grossman, D’Augelli & Frank, 2011; Singh, \nMeng, & Hansen, 2014; McCann & Brown, 2017). Individual and community resilience \nfactors can reduce risk of suicidality within the trans population (Moody & Smith, 2013; \nMoody, Fuks, Pelaez & Smith; 2015), although the processes that underlie this reduction \nremain largely unknown. Edwards, Torre-Barnal, Hanley & Martin (2019) provided some \nevidence for a process whereby perceived social support first increases an individual’s \nemotional stability, and thus indirectly leads to increased resilience and lower levels of \nsuicide risk.  \n \nTo date, minimal research has explored help-seeking for self-harm and suicidality specifically \nwithin the adult trans population. The current literature discusses experiences of/fear of \nstigma and discrimination within a healthcare context, fear of social consequences, and a \nbelief that their needs will not be met, as barriers to transgender people fully utilising \nprofessional health services in general (Ellis, Bailey & McNeil, 2015; McNair & Bush, 2016; \nShipherd, Greene & Abramovitz, 2010; Poteat, German & Kerrigan, 2013). Some limited \nresearch has hypothesised that trans people may be more likely to seek help for suicidal \ndistress only when a crisis point is reached (McDermott, Hughes and Rawlings, 2018; Effrig, \nBieschke & Locke, 2011), perhaps due to fear of rejection and exploitation (Hunt, Morrow & \nMcGuire, 2019). The existence of group-specific differences (e.g. based on education level, \nsocioeconomic status, culture, race, gender, age)(Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014), in addition \nto the substantial impact of attitudes and stigma on help-seeking (Niederkrotenthaler et al., \n2014; Calear, Batterham & Christensen, 2014), suggest that further suicide prevention \n \n58 \n \nresearch is needed to understand the underlying processes of trans-specific help-seeking \nbehaviours. \n \nLived Experience  \nInformation gained from quantitative research can help to determine a number of \nrisk/protective factors related to self-harm and suicidality. However, a deeper understanding \nof how and why these factors may lead to, or reduce, individuals’ risk of engaging in harmful \nbehaviours may require a more in-depth examination of accounts of suicidality (Hjelmeland \n& Loa Knizek, 2010). Qualitative research aimed at exploring the lived experiences of \nindividuals who are directly affected may help to provide rich insights into the context, \nmechanisms and intent underlying these complex phenomena for individuals, thus helping to \ninform suicide prevention policy and practice.  \n \nAim \nThe aim of the research was to explore the lived experience of transgender individuals \nwho report a history of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours.  \n \nResearch Questions \nI. What psychosocial factors are associated with an increased or decreased risk of \nself-harm and/or suicidality within the trans population? \nII. What are trans peoples’ experiences of help-seeking in the context of self-harm \nand/or suicidality? \n \n \n \n59 \n \nMethod \nDesign \nThe study employed a retrospective qualitative design. Semi-structured in-depth \ninterviews were conducted, and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis \n(IPA)(Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009).  \n \nEthical Considerations \nApproval was gained from the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Research and \nDevelopment Department (GN19MH431) and the West of Scotland Research Ethics \nCommittee (19-WS-0169)(Appendix 2.1). The confidential nature of participation, and limits \nthereof, were made explicit. Written informed consent was provided prior to interview \n(Appendix 2.2). The potentially sensitive and emotive topic was acknowledged, and \nparticipants advised that they did not need to answer any questions they did not wish to. A \nrisk screening tool (Appendix 2.7) was used at the start and end of every interview to \nascertain imminent risk of suicide specifically. No participant disclosed information \nsuggesting that they may be at imminent risk of suicide. A risk management plan was in \nplace should this have been required, including a field supervisor on site during interviews. \nConsideration was given to the participants’ emotional well-being following interview. \nParticipants described partaking as a cathartic experience, with some expressing a sense of \ngratification from contributing to research that may help toward improved outcomes for trans \npeople. A list of contacts for further support following interview was provided (Appendix \n2.8).  \n \n \n60 \n \n \nRecruitment  \nA purposive sample of adult transgender individuals with experience of self-harm \nand/or suicidality was sought from the Sandyford Gender Identity Service (GIS) within NHS \nGreater Glasgow and Clyde. The Sandyford GIS is not considered a mental health service; \nhowever it is a clinical service that provides support to any person who feels \nuncomfortable/uncertain about their gender identity. Potential participants who had provided \nconsent to be contacted for research purposes were identified from an internal waiting list, \nand sent information pertaining to the study (Appendix 2.3). Participants were identified by \nGIS administration staff who oversee the waiting lists and who were not involved in the \nresearch beyond recruitment. Interested individuals provided consent for the researcher to \ncontact them (Appendix 2.4). The researcher then telephoned to arrange a convenient \ninterview date/time.   \n \nParticipants and Sample Size \nIPA embraces smaller sample sizes which allow for a greater, in-depth exploration of \nparticipants’ accounts (Reid, Flowers & Larkin, 2005). Therefore, the study sought to recruit \nbetween 4 and 10 participants, which is the range of sample size recommended for doctoral \nresearch (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009). Inclusion criteria indicated that participants \nshould: (i) have a gender identity which is incongruent with sex assigned at birth, (ii) report a \nhistory of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours, (iii) be aged 17 or over, and (iv) \nbe fluent in English. The exclusion criteria included those with a known forensic history or \nwho were at imminent risk of suicide  \n \n61 \n \n \nSeven individuals were recruited between February 2020 and March 2020, however, this \nyielded a final sample size of four participants who were interviewed. One individual did not \nattend interview (no reason given) and two interviews were cancelled due to Covid-19 \nrestrictions. Recruitment ceased in line with the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde suspension \nof research activities in response to Covid-19 (Appendix 2.5). In light of these circumstances, \nthe data already gathered were discussed between researchers and the decision was made to \nend recruitment and progress to analysis with the reduced sample size.  \n \nData Collection \nInterviews were conducted by the first author (L.B.) at the Sandyford clinic, lasting \nbetween 57 minutes and 1 hour 22 minutes. A schedule was used to help structure these \ninterviews (Appendix 2.6) and support participants to reflect on the events, relationships and \nexperiences central to their self-harm and/or suicidality and help-seeking, in line with IPA’s \ninductive stance. The schedule was developed in discussion between researchers and field \nsupervisors, and through exploration of the current literature. Interviews were audio-recorded \nprior to full verbatim transcription.  \n \nInterviews began with open questions, encouraging participants to introduce what they deem \nimportant to their first-hand experience of self-harm and/or suicidality. An inductive process \nof reflection and probing questions was used throughout to facilitate a deeper exploration of \nparticipant’s accounts (e.g. “what sense do you make of that?”, “what was that like?”). The \ninterviews typically followed a chronological story of participants lived experience \n \n62 \n \npreceding, during and proceeding periods of suicidality and/or self-injurious \nthoughts/behaviours. Accounts of formal and informal help-seeking were intertwined within \nparticipant’s own understanding and factors related to self-harm and/or suicidality, as \nopposed to a separate topic of discussion.  \n \nData Analysis  \nIPA was chosen as its inductive epistemology is concerned with meaning-making, and \nallows for an, in-depth analysis of expert accounts. Through this analysis, IPA attempts to \ninterpret and present an account of the ways in which people understand and experience \nsubjective, important phenomena in their lives (e.g. self-harm and suicidality). Therefore the \nresearcher first immersed themselves in the data through repeatedly listening to, and re-\nreading, the interview transcript. As described by Smith et al. (2009), line-by-line analysis \nwas then completed, providing initial exploratory notes on descriptive, linguistic and \nconceptual content. Secondly, emergent themes were developed by engaging with the initial \ncoded data and interpreting what it might mean for participants to have these concerns, in this \ncontext. This analysis and interpretation was done in line with IPA’s hermeneutic stance; an \ninductive process whereby the focus is on interpretation of meaning within the individuals \naccount. Sample coding transcripts and emergent themes were reviewed between researchers \nto ensure coherence and plausibility of themes. An example analysed transcript is included in \nAppendix 2.9. Each participant’s data were analysed separately, before relationships between \nemergent themes within the group were considered. Shared higher-order qualities were \nidentified, whilst also accounting for unique idiosyncratic instances. Together, these were \nfurther interpreted and developed through an iterative process, whereby recurring key themes \nwere defined. The key themes presented were considered the ‘best fit’ for participants’ \nnarratives and were prevalent within all participants’ accounts.  \n \n63 \n \n \nResearcher Reflexivity \nThe researcher considered how their personal and professional experiences may have \ninfluenced how they conducted the research and data analysis. The researcher is a trainee \nclinical psychologist working within local mental health services, including with individuals \nexpressing suicidality. This experience provided the researcher with valuable knowledge of \nthe psychosocial concepts that participants discussed, although in turn required the researcher \nto suspend attempts to “formulate” participants’ lived experiences, focusing instead on \nparticipants’ own meaning-making processes. As a heterosexual cisgender woman, the \nresearcher explicitly acknowledged the implicit biases and assumptions that influenced them \nto undertake research in the field of suicidality in transgender populations. For example, by \npaying particular attention to the way in which transgender experiences are often portrayed \nwithin the existing literature, and how this led to pre-conceived ideas of a ‘typical’ \ntransgender experience being defined by risk and vulnerabilities. Throughout the process, the \nresearcher embraced an open-mind to participants’ experiences, as opposed to searching for \nsolely challenges in participants’ accounts or interpreting first-hand experiences related the \nphenomena of interest as being exclusively related to a participant’s transgender status. The \nresearcher kept reflective notes to help facilitate this reflective stance and ‘bracket-off’ \nbeliefs whist engaging in the analysis of data. Given the emotional content on the data, the \nresearcher also considered their own emotional response’s during the process, so as to be able \nto fully engage with the participants’ narratives.   \n \nResults \n \n64 \n \nThe sample characteristics are first discussed, before presenting the findings from the \nqualitative interviews. \nParticipant Characteristics \nParticipants were asked to: (i) describe their gender identity, and (ii) identify the sex \nthey were assigned at birth (Table 2). All participants currently lived in urban Scotland and \nwere aged between 19 and 27 (M=22.25, SD=3.59). All participants expressed a previous \ndesire to kill themselves and planning in response, with one participant having made a \nnumber of attempts to do so via overdose. All participants had expressed a desire to injure \nthemselves without intent to die, with three participants having done so multiple times by \ncutting. \n \nTable 2: Participant Characteristics \nPseudonym Sebastien Luke Cameron Eve \nAge (years) 27 19 20 23 \nGender Identity Non-binary Male Male Trans Female \nSex Assigned at \nBirth \nFemale Female Female Male \nSexual Identity Gay/Queer Bisexual Bisexual Queer \nEthnicity White British White \nIrish/Scottish \nWhite Scottish White Scottish \nReligion Catholic \nBackground \nSpiritual Protestant No Religion \nSuicidal Ideation* Yes (5 years) Yes (2 years) Yes (4 years) Yes (2 weeks) \nSuicide Attempt* No Yes (2.5 years) No No \nSelf-Harm* Desire \n(<2 weeks) \nYes (2 years) Yes (5 years) Yes (2 years) \n* (approx. time since last episode) \n \n65 \n \n \n \nQualitative Interviews \nFour superordinate themes and ten subordinate themes emerged from the analysis, as \nsummarised below in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Superordinate and Subordinate Themes Identified during the Analysis  \nSuperordinate  Subordinate \n \n \n \nEarly \nExperiences \n \n“Kicking up a fuss again”: Emotional invalidation  \n \n“Everything just keeps pilling up”: Cumulative stressors  \n  \n“I couldn’t understand why I was feeling like this”: Navigating norms  \n \n \n \n \nIntent \n \n \n“I just wanted someone to notice”: Communicating a need \n \n“It would numb me”: Dealing with dysphoria \n \n“I still had that like survival plan, it was suicide”: Escape from despair \n \n \nHope and \nResilience \n \n \n \n“I was just being happy that I could finally be me”: I can be me  \n \n“I existed as a human being”: Social connectedness \n \n \nThreats to \nResilience \n \n \n \n“More exposed”: Prejudice and discrimination \n  \n“Why is this not an emergency?”: Unmet needs \n  \n \nEarly Experiences  \n \n66 \n \nThe first superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of their journey \ntoward self-harm and/or suicidality. Three interrelated subthemes emerged that may describe \nrisk factors associated with greater risk of self-harm and/or suicidality for trans individuals, \nand touch on how these risk factors interact with experiences of help-seeking: i) emotional \ninvalidation, ii) cumulative stressors, iii) navigating norms.  \n \nEmotional Invalidation \nParticipants understood their experiences of self-harm and suicidality in the context of \nearly environments and interpersonal relationships that invalidated their internal emotional \nexperiences and contributed to suicidal distress. For Luke, there was a sense throughout his \nlife that persistent rejection of his expressions of emotion by others led to him \nconceptualising his experiences as abnormal or shameful, resulting in further suicidal \ndistress. He goes on to describe withdrawing from a formal mental health intervention and \nincreasing suicidal behaviours as a result: \n“my mental health issues were always just brushed off as just me looking for attention \nand me just needlessly being like wanting to make other people suffer … I just got sick \nof it all of that and I was just like right if she wants me to stop going, I’ll just stop \ngoing, and then I think it was like 2 months later was my first suicide attempt”. (Luke) \n \nSimilarly, Sebastien described how their family often minimised their distress, “I was the \n‘problem child’; the one that always like kicks up a fuss and has a tantrum”, and reflected on \nreduced seeking of support from caregivers when in distress, as a result. Cameron provided \n \n67 \n \nan explicit account of how these invalidating responses interacted with informal help-seeking \nto create emotional distance: \n“When we were in a relationship … I would reach out to them for support [and] it \nwas almost, “well it’s not that bad because I’ve went through *this*”… my problems \nwere squashed and that would just make it worse for me.” (Cameron) \n \nCameron’s use of ‘squashed’ emphasises how his distress was belittled by those in the \nposition to provide informal support, thus increasing his negative affect whilst reducing his \ncapacity to adaptively cope. It is important to note that for participants, these early \nexperiences were perceived as invalidation and rejection of their emotional experiences at \nthat time and not specifically of their gender identity.    \n \nCumulative Stressors \nAn accumulation of early adversity and potentially traumatic experiences were \nhighlighted throughout, leading to an increase in hopelessness and increased capacity for self-\nharm and suicidality, “everything just keeps pilling up and em- what’s the [point]?” (Luke). \nEach participant demonstrated a preoccupation with age when conceptualising their life \nexperiences, “I was so young at that point- and I was going through all my own stuff in \nschool and the thoughts I was having about like [my gender]” (Eve), portraying a sense of \npowerlessness in the face of cumulative, overwhelming stressors beyond their capacity to \ncope with, “I felt so young but so old” (Luke). Participants’ accounts of how they responded \nto these accumulating external stressors were dominated by a sense of helplessness and \nnormalisation which reduced their motivation to seek help, “I was just saying well it’s the \n \n68 \n \ncards that I’ve been dealt with in life you know, this is just my life, you know this was just my \nnormality” (Cameron).  \n \nParticipants placed the discovery of their transgender identity within the context of \npsychological saturation and an already depleted capacity for coping. Below, Sebastien’s use \nof ‘upheaval’ reflects an anticipatory stress of disclosure; a sense of likely unpredictable or \nnegative consequences and significant disruption to their life. They demonstrate how this \nminority stress further adds to this accumulation of stressors, which simultaneously reduces \ntheir preparedness or readiness to explore their gender identity, thus maintaining and \nperpetuating distress. \n “I was not ready to be thinking about- I was like I’d already done the upheaval of \ncoming out as gay, I didn’t want to lose that label, I didn’t want to be a man, I didn’t \nwant to- it was just- I wasn’t ready for any of that stuff.” (Sebastien) \n \nNavigating Norms \nParticipants described challenges in understanding their experiences of gender \ndysphoria through comparisons with social norms, within the context of cisnormativity. They \noften described a period prior to the discovery of their transgender identity whereby they \nstruggled to name their dysphoria, leading to heightening suicidal distress and reduced ability \nto seek help, “I couldn’t understand why I was feeling like this … I was getting really low, I \nwas crying at school, I couldn’t really explain it to people” (Cameron).  \n \n \n69 \n \nLuke describes misinterpreting gender dysphoria as “a problem with me, rather than \nsomething I was struggling with”, leading to self-stigma and further suicidal distress. Below, \nLuke struggles to describe and quantify the impact of this misinterpretation, instead \ndescribing a sense of relief that younger trans youth may have different norms to draw upon \nand greater clarity of gender-related self-concept. His repetition of ‘so so so’ further \nexemplifies this relief, and conversely the impact that the misinterpretation of gender \ndysphoria had on his distress and coping: \n“If I had known earlier that gender dysphoria was a thing or that like mental health \nissues were a thing emm and like, I, I, just things would have been so different … I’m \njust so so so glad that emm other people emm like there is the, there is the, the \nopportunity that other people don’t have to go through all of that”. (Luke) \n \nSimilarly, Eve conveyed increasing negative affect in response to her reattributing her gender \nexperience as ‘abnormal’ as she entered adolescence; a developmental stage whereby identity \ndevelopment and social norms become increasingly central to our world view: \n“…when I was in my early teens, before I came out as transgender - I think that’s \nwhen [self-harm] started … like growing up like I always- I thought it  was quite \nnormal to be the way I was … I thought I was female. I thought that was like the \nnorm, and then starting secondary school that’s when I was like ‘this isny the norm \nlike to be like this’.” (Eve) \n \n \n70 \n \nEve goes on to highlight how social norms and stigma negatively influenced others’ \nresponses to her help-seeking, thus further reinforcing her negative gender-related self-\nconcept:    \n“…everybody I’d reach out to- I wouldn’t feel like I would like get the help or get the \nlike people understanding like what I was going through, they’d just think that like \nthat I was like fucked in the head basically.” (Eve) \n \nIntent  \nThe second superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of what they \ngained by acting on their self-harm and suicidality. Three interrelated subthemes emerged \nthat may reflect the intent behind these behaviours for participants: i) communication of need, \nii) dealing with dysphoria, and iii) escape from despair. \n \nCommunication of need \nSelf-harm and suicidality were often described as ways to communicate an unmet \nneed; seeking care and emotional validation from others in response to distress. Sebastien \nconveys a profound sense throughout of being physically present within their family yet \nalone in their distress, with their emotional needs being overlooked. They reflected on their \nthoughts of self-injury and suicidality as a means of communicating their pain, “I just wanted \nsomeone to notice that I wasn’t very happy” (Sebastien). \n \n \n71 \n \nParticipants described how self-harm and/or suicidality was often reinforced by responses \nfrom others that met their need for validation or care. Eve described connection to an adult \nwithin her school that was fostered through these communications of distress, “it was just \nnice to hear that somebody cared about you” (Eve). Cameron placed his self-harm and \nsuicidality within the context of interpersonal conflict, describing a view that his existence \nwas disregarded by his caregivers. He portrays a ‘turning-point’ in his narrative, born from a \ncompassionate response to his self-harm:  \n“…it’s was almost as if [the image] would just flash in my head - just sitting on my \nmum’s couch and having her just come up and hug me, and it was pretty powerful and \nthen almost after a couple of weeks the thoughts of self-harming just would stop … I \nthink it was because I, I’ve seen her cry before, but because she was crying over \nsomething I’d done … I didn’t actually expect her to be so upset about it and she \nembraced me in such a big hug and stuff like that and she was supportive, more \nsupportive than she’d ever been, and that’s really what took- it took me so back and it \nreally kind of shocked me and I was like ‘fuck’, you know?” (Cameron).  \n \nArguably, Cameron’s self-harm reduced in line with a reduction in his urge to communicate \nhis unmet need for care and nurture, highlighting the protective impact that the mental \nrepresentation of a compassionate caregiver had on his coping. \n \nDealing with Dysphoria \n \n72 \n \nParticipants provided powerful accounts of self-harm as a means of responding to a \nself that was considered flawed or ‘abnormal’, within the context of gender dysphoria. Eve \nrecalled the dulling of dysphoria that was achieved through self-harm;  \n“I would look at girls and I’d be like- I want to be like that, that’s what I would like. \nI’d do anything to be like just like that, like so normal and em and I remember I’d like \nI’d take a knife and I’d press really hard like really like going harder and harder and \njust to feel the pain and I think it would numb me in a way.” (Eve) \n \nSebastien described avoiding exploration of self throughout, “I just didn’t feel right as a \nhuman being. It was just… everything felt wrong and I would just ignore it”, and consistently \nconveyed thoughts of self-harm as a means of maladaptive coping/avoidance of distress:  \n“…I would think about hurting myself but then that’s also upsetting and making it \nworse in the long run and it was like “oh my god I’m doing rubbish at this, think \nabout breaking your arms” or whatever to distract from that but then that was also \nupsetting” (Sebastien) \n \nSimilarly, Luke spoke of seeking clarity and control over his experience of gender dysphoria. \nIn the context of an ambiguous pain that was challenging to name, he described instead \nexpressing this pain through self-harm and suicidality. Luke describes an intense hatred of his \nself and body which he describes having sought to control through restrictive eating, with \nself-harm being also framed as punishment: \n“…partly relief like just expressing mental pain physically and partly em punishment \nfor what I perceived to be bad eating habits” (Luke). \n \n73 \n \n \nEscape from despair \nA portrayal of a perpetual despair from which there felt no alternative escape was \nevident throughout. Luke recalls what he hoped to gain from an attempt to end his life: \n“…seeking relief from all this pain and seeking control over all this pain and emm \nover life in general. Emm, everything was just so overwhelming, everything was just- I \ncouldn’t see an end, I couldn’t see any way of this getter better … I just wanted \neverything, all the pain to stop” (Luke). \n \nLuke’s continual use of ‘everything’ magnifies his sense of desperation and hopelessness in \nthe face of an emotional pain that defines and controls his life. As a result, his description \ndemonstrates a narrowing of perspective and ability to consider alternative means of \nalleviating this distress.  Eve describes her emotional experience as a monster in her head \nthrough which there is little escape. She goes on to place her suicidality as a means to \nunburden herself from unrelenting conflict, “I think I’d be better off dead and I’d just… to be \nat peace” (Eve). \n \nSimilarly, Cameron described a sense of calm and acceptance that occurred after finalising \nhis suicide plans. His use of ‘survival plan’ below to describe suicidality draws parallels with \nan ‘escape route’ and is a striking example of how for some, the knowledge of a possible \nfinality to unbearable distress provides a sense of safety and possible means to cope:  \n \n74 \n \n“…I was just like I canny cope with this anymore, I canny cope, and it got to- em, I \nstill had those thoughts of suicide and even though I’d stopped self-harming I still had \nthat like survival plan, it was suicide- like, right if anything happened at school this is \nwhat I was going to do.” (Cameron) \n \n \nHope and Resilience  \nThe third superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of reducing \nself-harm and suicidality. Two interrelated subthemes emerge that may reflect internal and \nexternal processes which contribute to increasing resiliency: i) I can be me, and ii) social \nconnectedness. \n \nI can be me \nNarratives shared a sense of hopefulness for the future that occurred in line with a \npositive reappraisal of self and further transgender identity development. Eve described a \nperiod whereby distress and subsequent self-harm and suicidality were diminished in light of \nreduced conflict of self following coming out: \n “I [came out] and after that I thought like- I didn’t have any suicidal thoughts. For \nthe first like two years as being out as trans I was like in my element, I was just being \nhappy that I could finally be me.” (Eve) \n \n \n75 \n \nHer use of ‘in my element’ to describe the impact of being able to live as a trans woman \ncommunicates a sense of a flourishing self that feels unstoppable in the face of adversity. \nOften participants described a social process by which their understanding of their selves in \nrelation to others shifted and precipitated a reduction in harmful behaviours. Sebastien \ndescribes a ‘life-changing’ experience whereby they met people representative of their own \ngender identity. Their account below references a previous appraisal of a flawed, or ‘boring’ \nself, contrasting this with a sense of elation at the realisation that their gender identity, and \narguably their self, is both valid and acceptable: \n “I met people who were non-binary. I didn’t- I didn’t know-  it still gets me a bit \nsometimes like (funny voice) “ooh.. you’re really allowed to be non-binary? Ha! - \nthat’s what the crazy Americans do! (laughs) that’s not what the more boring people \ndo!” …. Yeah no it.. gave me hope. People had like, lives and careers and families” \n(Sebastien) \n \nMoreover, Sebastien demonstrates how this reappraisal of self allowed them to overcome \nhopelessness and uncertainty for the future, which was maintained by a struggle with a \nconcept of self and gender identity that didn’t fit with their understanding of what their future \nshould contain. Luke described a shift in his narrative whereby suicidal ambivalence became \nevident, “one little switch that wasn’t flipped anymore” (Luke). When making sense of this \nexperience, he describes increasing hopefulness upon meeting other trans people who were \ntaking steps toward their transition. He conveys how this lead to the ability to define his self \nas transgender and develop a mental representation of a favourable future:  \n“I think I felt a lot more hopeless emm, especially before I started understanding what \nI was experiencing was partly gender dysphoria …. that was the one flip, the main \n \n76 \n \nswitch even, it just kind of gave me that little bit of hope …. there was just this little \nspark of hope that I can “oh like things can be different later on” (Luke) \n \nSocial Connectedness \nParticipants described how the development of positive interpersonal relationships \nand a sense of belongingness had a profound and positive impact on their psychological well-\nbeing and ability to cope with adversity. Cameron explicitly makes reference to a widening \nsocial network, encompassing family, friends, a romantic relationship and various social \norganisations, when reflecting on his current absence of self-harm and suicidality:   \n“But em so [my support network’s] a lot different from what it was now, at the time it \nwas barely non-existent I would say. I’d be quite comfortable saying that – I did not \nhave a support system at that time. And now it’s, you know, quite cooshty.”(Cameron) \n \nSebastien described a ‘turning-point’ in their experience of suicidality, dominated by \ndescriptions of social connectedness. Their quote below highlights their development of a \nsense of belongingness, leading to an increase in positive affect and self-esteem: \n “So everywhere you walk, like someone was happy to see you. Five full days of like- \nunconditional positive regard. Do you know what I mean? People happy to see you \nand interested in you …. it gave me an idea that I could- that one I existed as a human \nbeing that other people would be interested to hear from” (Sebastien) \n \n \n77 \n \nMoreover, Sebastian’s description of coming to feel that they existed as part of the human \nrace underscores their previous sense of profound isolation. \n \nThreats to Resilience \nThe fourth superordinate theme deals with how participants make sense of a fragile \nbalance between protective and risk factors. In particular, additional risk factors that \nincreased in line with their transition. Two interrelated subthemes emerge that may reflect \nadditional minority stressors which can threaten resilience and may contribute to risk of self-\nharm and/or suicidality: i) prejudice and discrimination, and ii) unmet needs. \n \nPrejudice and Discrimination \nParticipants provided multiple and varying accounts of prejudice and discrimination \nwhich lead to a reduced sense of safety and increased negative affect. These experiences were \ndemonstrated through both general social interactions and within close interpersonal \nrelationships. Eve’s account was dominated at times by experiences of prejudice and \ndiscrimination, including being the victim of hate crimes within the community. She made \nsense of her increasing suicidality in this context, sharing that these experiences had the \npower to outweigh resilience factors at times: \n“I’ve been… I got spat on once off a guy and I remember that, that night was ho- \nhorrible. I had to go home, I went home crying. I think that’s like- that’s the point it’s \nlike when you go home and then you go back home yourself and like you’re dealing \nwith all those thoughts enough” (Eve) \n \n78 \n \n \nFor Eve, microaggressions within romantic relationships were also conveyed frequently and \nappeared core to a reduction in resilience for her, “I would feel like I was a toy or like I’d get \nused as a fetish, just not as a real human being”. These subtle communications of prejudice \nwere highlighted throughout Cameron’s account of his family’s response to him being \ntransgender, such as his family’s refusal to use his name or pronouns. For example, he spoke \nof his brother choosing instead to use the name of a cartoon character, likening his gender \nidentity to a costume: \n“My brother has been very good, he won’t call me [deadname] but he won’t call me \nCameron, he’ll call me [cartoon character] who I dressed up as for Halloween one \nyear.” (Cameron) \n \nThere was the sense that Cameron had come to appraise these interpersonal communications \nas ‘acceptable’ or ‘better than before’, despite the negative impact that they have on his sense \nof self-worth, in order to be able to make use of the social support within these relationships. \nParticipants also reflected on how increasing trans visibility within society can also have \nnegative consequences for the trans community, “awful people talking about [trans people] \nnow and spreading mis-information” (Luke).  As a result, participants describe negotiating \ntheir own visibility within society, in line with awareness of discrimination. Sebastien’s \nexample shows a process by which they understand distress on a continuum between being \nfeeling safe/invisible but dysphoric vs being unsafe/visible and comfortable with their gender \npresentation: \n \n79 \n \n“I think things have changed a lot [in a positive way], but also I think it’s, ironically \nin the last few years it’s much more acceptable to be a knobhead .... I worry about my \nown safety …. I feel a bit more exposed to [prejudice] because [now] people know \nthat there’s something to clock and if they’re going to be angry about it then they \nknow it’s - me. Whereas [4 years ago] they were angry at some concept that they saw \non the telly …. I feel more visible, although weirdly I feel less visible now because of \nthe way my body has changed [recently]. Thank god nobody can see me but also can \nthose people not see me, you know can I close my eyes?” (Sebastien) \n \nAt times Sebastien describes actively accounting for and balancing these factors, for example \nby wearing more feminine hairstyles at work so as not to ‘rock the boat’. \n \nUnmet needs \nWhilst reflecting on their lived experiences, the desire for services that are equipped \nwith the knowledge, skills and capacity to provide care for trans people was described by all \nparticipants, including both gender affirming services and mental health services.  \nParticipants expressed uncertainty and hopelessness when faced with the task of accessing \ngender affirming services; “Like [gender clinic] waiting lists are so long and in that way I \nfelt hopeless” (Luke).  Participants’ narratives suggest a belief that trans people’s needs are \nbeing minimized or ignored. Sebastien questions why stretched gender services and unmet \nneeds aren’t prompting an emergency response, perhaps indicating that should another area \nof health care or group within the population be experiencing similar challenges, then greater \nefforts would be made to curtail these:  \n \n80 \n \n “…it makes me so angry and makes me feel like I’m not important, and that I’m less \nimportant than other people. And they’re saying, “but we’re busy”, I understand that \nyou’re busy but you’re not looking after- like, this is not a system which can look after \npeople so why is this not an emergency? .... it feels like they don’t care.” (Sebastien) \n \nParticipants’ accounts, like Sebastien’s above, parallel the emotionally invalidating responses \nto expressions of distress and help-seeking that participants conveyed in their journey \ntowards self-harm and suicidality. Cameron described being deflated by an adult mental \nhealth service that was ill-equipped to consider trans specific experiences/stressors when \nthinking about his psychological well-being. As he conveys below, there was a sense that his \nneeds remained unmet, with his use of ‘shot it down’ mirroring his previous descriptions of \nhis needs being ‘squashed’ by others:  \n“I’d mentioned [being trans] to them but they shot it down, they were like, “that’s not \nour department, we don’t want to deal with it, if you want to do that we can get you \ncontact with the relevant information”, I was like, “*sigh* right, ok”” (Cameron) \n \nEve described feeling lost between a gender identity service that is perceived as more able to \nmeet her needs, but is not a mental health service, and mental health services which are not \ntrans-specific. Eve described anticipation of stigma or a response similar to that which \nCameron received as barriers to engaging:  \n“I just backed out, but that was more because my anxiety, that was like, cause I \nwanted to talk to someone that was like- knew about trans and stuff like that …. \n \n81 \n \n[mental health services] would just be- they never knew anything about like, like \nbeing trans or anything like that, down that side of it.” (Eve) \n \nFor Eve, this resulted in her declining timely formal support and later using a crisis help-line \nin response to increasing suicidal intent. Despite this, anticipated stigma was still present in \nEve’s account, where she conveys a belief that general services are ‘not for trans people’: \n“I was thinking like oh my god is [Samaritan’s worker] going to be like- cause \nobviously like that’s not the- like if they get trans people phoning I was like, ‘is she \ngonny be alright that I’m trans?’”(Eve). \n \nDiscussion \nThe current study explored transgender individuals’ lived experience of self-harm and \nsuicidality, and provided the opportunity to understand how trans individuals viewed changes \nin risk and resilience at various stages in their lives. Following IPA analysis, four \nsuperordinate themes emerged: i) early experiences, ii) intent, iii) hope and resilience, and iv) \nthreats to resilience. The main findings and unique contributions are discussed in detail, with \nreference to existing literature. The methodological strengths and limitations are noted, \nbefore discussing implications for clinical practice and research. \n \nEarly experiences associated with an increased risk of self-harm and suicidality  \nConsistent with existing research, the current study highlights the role of perceived \nfamily invalidation and perceived peer invalidation in contributing to youth self-harm and \n \n82 \n \nsuicidality (Adrian, Berk, Korslund et al., 2018; Yen, Kuehn, Tezanos, et al., 2015). The \nperceived invalidation or rejection of participants’ emotional experiences was described as \nhaving compromised their attachment to caregivers and interpersonal connectedness, which \nmay have contributed to thwarted belongingness and consequently suicidal desire, in line \nwith the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Van Orden, Witte, Cukrowicz et al., 2010). Early \nadversity and disrupted attachment experiences have consistently been associated with \nsuicidality (Fergusson, Woodward & Horwood, 2000; Turecki & Brent, 2016), however the \ncurrent findings suggest these experiences may also complicate the internal and external \nprocess of gender identity exploration for trans individuals. Participants reflected on an \naccumulation of stressful childhood experiences, with transgender identity development \npositioned as an additional source of distress within this context of elevated vulnerability. \nFurther research is required to understand this interaction, however these environmental and \nsocial stressors may compromise an individual’s sense of safety and capacity to cope with \nexcess stress associated with minority status, such as anticipated rejection, identity \nconcealment and internalized transphobia (Meyer, 2003; Rood, Reisner, Surace et al., 2016).  \n \nAlthough not directly measured, participants’ reported cumulative stressors (including \nemotional neglect, domestic violence, parental substance misuse and ill-mental health) could \nalso be considered Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), which are significantly \nassociated self-harm and suicide risk within the general population (Choi, Dinitto, Marti & \nSegal, 2017; Fuller-Thomson, Barid, Dhrodia & Brennenstuhl, 2016). These findings are in \nline with Austin et al. (2020) who first explored the impact of ACEs on suicidality within the \ntrans population, and found that emotional neglect lead to 2.5 times increased risk of lifetime \nsuicide attempt.  Future research may help to further explore the relationship between ACEs, \nminority stressors and self-harm and/or suicidality within the transgender population. \n \n83 \n \n \nThe analysis illuminated how cisnormativity may contribute to unique risk for trans \nindividuals, with participants describing a lack of gender-related self-concept clarity (i.e. \ndifficulty understanding and verifying own gender identity or expression) and self-concept \nnegativity within this context (i.e. negative cognitions or emotions related to own gender \nidentity or expression). Kuper, Adams and Mustanski (2018) found that gender-related self-\nconcept negativity, but not lack of clarity, is positively associated with suicidal ideation \nwithin the trans population. Conversely, the current study suggests a relationship between \nclarity of gender-related self-concept and risk of self-harm and suicidality, perhaps due to \ncapturing qualitative data from individuals reflecting on various stages of their gender-\nidentity development, or due to including both self-harm and suicidality as phenomena of \ninterest. \n \nThese early experiences also shaped participants’ help-seeking, whereby participants \ndescribed difficulties appraising their distress, experiencing internal and external stigma, and \na normalisation of their distress as barriers to seeking help. At times, experiences of help-\nseeking were described negatively (e.g. due to rejection, invalidation, stigma), which both \nincreased distress and reduced their motivation to seek further help. For trans individuals, \nunderstanding the components of their distress (e.g. emotional distress due to life experiences \nin addition gender dysphoria) and stigma may be more prominent, however further \nqualitative research may help to examine barriers and facilitators to trans individuals seeking \nformal and informal support when experiencing suicidal distress in greater depth. \n \n \n84 \n \nThe intent behind self-harm and suicidality \nCurrent findings expand existing literature describing the communicative and social \nfunction of self-harm and suicidality (Cipriano, Cella & Cotrufo, 2017; Grimmond et al., \n2019), whereby participants expressed a desire to communicate their distress, seeking \nemotional validation and compassion from others. Self-harm as a means to distract from or \nreduce gender dysphoria was noted, lending support to literature highlighting trans-specific \nmotivations for self-harm (Morris & Galupo, 2019). Further, in-depth qualitative research \nmay help to explore trans-specific motivations for self-harm and/or suicidality. A desire to \nescape an intolerable psychological pain, or ‘psychache’ (Shneidman, 1985), in the context of \ndepleted adaptive coping strategies, was key to participants’ narratives of the intentions \nunderlying their suicidality in particular. Findings are in line with the integrated motivational-\nvolitional model of suicidal behaviour which documents the role of entrapment in the \nemergence of suicidal motivation, moderated by deficits in problem solving and coping \n(O’Connor & Kirtley, 2018).  \n \nProtective factors associated with decreased risk of self-harm and suicidality  \nThe ability to conceptualise and self-define your own gender has been suggested as a \nresilience strategy for trans youth (Singh, Meng, & Hansen, 2014). Moody, Fuks, Pelaez & \nSmith (2015) described the process of realisation, understanding and acceptance of \ntransgender identity as protective against suicidal ideation for trans individuals. The current \nstudy replicates these findings and illuminates how the process of positive group identity \ndevelopment may play a role in cultivating hope and transnormativity. The current study \nmirrors existing literature suggesting greater perceived social support enhances psychological \nresilience (Grossman, D’Augelli & Frank, 2011; Singh et al., 2014) and reduces suicide risk \n \n85 \n \n(Moody et al., 2015). However studies have also cautioned that increased social support may \nnot independently reduce risk of suicidality within the trans population (Austin, Craig, \nD’Souza, McInroy, 2020). Again, further research is required to understand the processes \nunderlying resilience and risk reduction within this population.  \n \nFactors which threatened the resilience of participants \nMoving on from periods of suicidality and self-harm seemed to coincide with \nincreasing resilience; however, subsequent threats to resilience were also discussed. Prejudice \nand discrimination are well-recognised risk factors for self-harm and suicidality within the \ntrans population (Marshalle et al., 2016; McNeil et al., 2017). Bockting, Barucco & LeBlanc \net al. (2020) recently noted that greater trans visibility within society, although undoubtedly a \npositive step, unfortunately may also increase trans individuals’ experiences of prejudice and \ndiscrimination. The current study supports these findings, and provides additional insights \ninto how trans individuals may respond as these minority stressors become increasingly \nsalient. Participants describe feeling ‘more exposed’ and increasingly worried about their \nsafety in recent years as the wider population, some of whom may hold prejudice and \ndiscriminatory beliefs toward the transgender population, become increasingly concerned \nwith trans individuals. As a result, participants described moderating their gender expression \nor gender-affirming needs to preserve a felt sense of safety, which is particularly noteworthy \ngiven that positive self-identity factors (i.e. ‘I can be me’ theme) were protective for \nindividuals. Similar cognitive and emotional responses to anticipated discrimination for \ntransgender individuals were summarised by Rood, Reisner & Surace (2016), including fear, \nanxiety, and hypervigilance. \n \n \n86 \n \nConsistent with the existing literature, challenges in accessing inclusive mental health care \nand gender-affirming services were, unsurprisingly, described as significant stressors (Ellis, \nBailey & McNeil, 2015) as well as being threats to participants’ resilience (Singh et al., \n2014). Current findings underscore how experiences of/anticipated stigma within a healthcare \ncontext is a barrier to receiving appropriate, timely mental health care, including when \nexperiencing suicidal distress. Current findings lend some support to the hypothesis that trans \npeople may be more likely to seek help only when a crisis point is reached (McDermott et al., \n2018; Effrig, Bieschke & Locke, 2011). Importantly, the current study demonstrates how \nhealth care inequalities contribute to a profound sense of hopelessness, frustration and unmet \nneed for a group of individuals who experience elevated risk of negative outcomes, including \nself-harm and suicidality (Marshall et al., 2016; McNeil et al., 2017). \n \nStrengths and Limitations  \nThe findings represent the in-depth experiences of a small sample of trans individuals, \nand so are suggestive as opposed to conclusive. Additionally, the sample includes only young \ntrans adults who have accessed gender-affirming health care. As suggested by Smith, Flowers \nand Larkin (2009) the themes were contextualised and substantiated by the inclusion of \nexcerpts thereby assisting the reader in determining the transferability of the findings to \nothers. Similarly, non-binary and gender non-conforming individuals are underrepresented \nwithin research (Wolford-Clevenger et al., 2018) and so recruitment sought to be as inclusive \nas possible. However, it is acknowledged that trans experiences are not universal and so the \ninclusion of multiple gender identities may have decreased the homogeneity of the sample. \nThe current study discusses the experiences of one minority group. Difficulty exists in \ngeneralising the current results to other minority groups who may be at greater risk of \n \n87 \n \nsuicidality, due to the diversity in their lived experiences and the factors that may increase \nrisk and/or reduce protective factors (e.g. culture, barriers to help-seeking, social norms, \naccess to healthcare, poverty, substance misuse, stigma, and social exclusion).   \n \nSimilarly, the current study explored first-hand accounts of self-harm and/or suicidality from \na non-clinical sample of transgender adults, although the majority of participants had not \nexperienced self-harm or suicidal distress in a number of years. Therefore the results \nrepresent individuals who were experiencing, or had experienced, a prolonged period of \npsychological stability and so the integrity or depth of their accounts may have been reduced \ngiven the elapsed time since the acute distress. The current sample, however, allowed for a \nnuanced, unique perspective of how transgender individuals may experience psychosocial \nstressors and protective factors differently at various stages in their life. \n  \nThe chosen qualitative methodology and IPA are considered strengths when exploring lived \nexperiences; however they are not without limitations. As noted, the small sample sizes \nembraced in IPA may limit the generalisability of the results. The subjectivity of IPA could \nalso be considered a limitation, whereby two researchers may interpret the same account \ndifferently. A second researcher therefore reviewed transcripts and emerging codes to \nincrease reliability, and no disagreements were noted. Given the retrospective nature of the \nqualitative interviews, there is increased likelihood that accounts are subject to recall bias due \nto additional, subsequent insights. The interview schedule could be improved for future \nresearch as the discussions regarding help-seeking naturally occurred throughout accounts of \npsychosocial protective/risk factors, as opposed to a separate area of discussion.  \n \n88 \n \n \nClinical Implications \nThe interviews point to a number of factors which may complicate identity \ndevelopment for trans youth and thus increase distress and risk of self-harm or suicidality. As \nour understanding of gender continues to advance, educating health professionals, young \npeople, schools and the wider population on gender and transgender identities may help to \nplay a role in reducing cisnormativity and stigma, and in turn help to normalise gender \nidentity development for trans youth. Similarly, mental health services should have the ability \nmeet trans individual needs, regardless of what presenting problems arise. Services should \nvalidate transgender individuals’ lived experiences and seek to reduce sources of stigma; for \nexample, by withholding making cisnormative assumptions regarding someone’s gender \nidentity or expression and maintain a reflective stance regarding their own implicit biases. It \nis vital that clinicians possess the knowledge and skills required to deliver risk assessments \nthat encompass both trans-specific experiences and general factors known to increase risk of \nself-harm and/or suicidality. Healthcare providers and professional courses (e.g. Doctorates \nin Clinical Psychology) should consider learning outcomes that reflect the needs of \ntransgender individuals and other minority groups.  \n \nBarriers to help-seeking may be reduced if referrers are able to discuss the enhanced learning \npractices that local community mental health teams have implemented to ensure they are best \nable to meet their needs. Culturally inclusive informal support should also be offered, in \naddition to those that individuals are often directed to (e.g. Samaritans). Engagement in \npsychological therapy may also be facilitated by addressing gender and power dynamics early \nwithin the therapeutic relationships. The current study also highlights the protective role of \n \n89 \n \nincreased resilience for participants, and thus psychological therapies aimed at enhancing \ninternal and external resilience strategies may help to prevent suicide within the trans \npopulation. Dickey and Budge (2020) provide an overview of how psychological \ninterventions play a key role in supporting trans individuals, highlighting interventions that \nfocus on self-compassion and aim to reduce the impact of proximal minority stressors on \npsychological well-being.  \n \nThe socio-political context is also relevant to suicide prevention. Policy reform that protects \nthe rights, dignity and well-being of transgender people is imperative. The increasing \nvisibility of trans individuals, which may place them at further risk of prejudice and \ndiscrimination, commands these protections urgently. Policies and processes should \nchallenge the social norms that maintain stigma for trans individuals, reduce restrictions to \nresilience factors for trans individuals (e.g. being able to self-define their own gender (or ‘I \ncan be me’)), and address mental and physical healthcare inequalities. The focus on \nhealthcare inequalities is particularly relevant in the context of Covid-19, whereby healthcare \nservices were halted or vastly reduced, which may exacerbate existing barriers to health care \nand threats to psychological well-being for trans individuals (van der Miesen, Raaijmakers, & \nvan de Grift, 2020; Wang, Pan & Liu, 2020).  \n \nFuture Directions \nThe discussion has highlighted a number of directions for future research, including \nefforts to better understand: i) the impact that increasing trans visibility may have on the lives \nof trans individuals, ii) trans-specific motivations for self-harm and suicidality, and iii) the \n \n90 \n \nrelationship between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and suicidality within the trans \npopulation. Future qualitative research may provide rich insights into similarities and \ndivergence between trans individuals who report a history of/life-time suicide attempt and \nrecent attempts.  \n \nConclusion \nThe current study describes how transgender individuals may experience psychosocial \nfactors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of their lives. For \nexample, adverse early relationships and experiences may complicate the process of gender \nidentity development and help-seeking, whereas healthcare inequalities and increasing \nminority stressors may later threaten resilience. Important insights into both the processes \nunderlying the relationship between resilience and suicide risk, and the motivations for self-\nharm and suicidality within the trans population emerged. There remains a need for further \nempirical research to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender \npopulation.  \n \n  \n \n91 \n \nReferences \nAdams, N., Hitomi, M., Moody, C.

The historical view of gender being wholly binary (e.g. male/female) does \nnot accurately reflect the spectrum of gender expression (Richards et al., 2016). Therefore \ntransgender people may describe a number of different personal experiences of gender; \nincluding transmen, transwomen, non-binary, gender diverse and genderqueer identities \n(Vincent, 2018). Trans people may also have a fluid gender identity and so may identify with \nmore than one term at any given time, or the term they identify with may change over time \n(McNeil, Ellis & Eccles, 2017). Importantly, sexual orientation and gender identity are \ndistinctly separate.  \n \nCisgender \n The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at \nbirth reflects their gender identity.  \n \n  \n \n104 \n \nAppendix 1.3: PROSPERO registration \n \n \n105 \n \n \n106 \n \n \n107 \n \n \n \n \n108 \n \nAppendix 1.4: ASSIA database search \n \n \n109 \n \n \n \n110 \n \n \n  \n \n111 \n \nAppendix 1.5: CINHAL database search \n \n \n112 \n \n \n \n113 \n \n \n114 \n \n \n115 \n \n \n  \n \n116 \n \nAppendix 1.6: COCHRANE database search\n \n117 \n \n \n118 \n \n \n119 \n \n \n  \n \n120 \n \nAppendix 1.7: EMBASE database search\n \n \n121 \n \n \n122 \n \n \n123 \n \n \n  \n \n124 \n \nAppendix 1.8: Psychology & Behavioural Sciences database search\n \n125 \n \n \n126 \n \n \n127 \n \n \n128 \n \n \n129 \n \n \n130 \n \n \n  \n \n131 \n \nAppendix 1.9: PsycARTICLES database search\n \n132 \n \n \n133 \n \n \n134 \n \n \n135 \n \n \n136 \n \n \n137 \n \n \n138 \n \n \n  \n \n139 \n \nAppendix 1.10: PsycINFO database search\n \n140 \n \n \n141 \n \n \n142 \n \n  \n \n143 \n \nAppendix 1.11: Data extraction tool \nData Extraction       Paper Number \n \nCitation \n \n \nStudy Characteristics \nStudy Author(s): \nTitle: \nYear: \nLocation: \nStudy purpose/aims: \n \n \n \nSample Characteristics \nInclusion/exclusion criteria: \nGender identities: \nSize: \nAge range: \nMean age: \nRecruitment: \nOther: \n \n \nData Collection/Analysis \nDesign: \n \nMethod: \n \nMeasures used: \n \n \n \nAnalysis: \n \n \n \nFindings \nResults: \n \n \n \n \n \n144 \n \n \n \nMain findings: \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion: \n \n \n \n \n \nStrengths: \n \n \n \nLimitations: \n \n \n \n \nAny other notes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n145 \n \nAppendix 1.12: Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT)\n \n \n146 \n \n \n  \n \n147 \n \nAppendix 1.13: Quality appraisal ratings \n \n \n \nAuthor/Year Preliminaries Introduction Design Sampling Data \nCollection \nEthical \nMatters \nResults Discussion Total \nScore \n \nDescriptive \n1.

(2012)  \n \nA taxonomy of transgender microaggressions (or 12 themes of transgender microaggressions) was \nfirst proposed by Nadal et al. (2012)(noted at Study 7 within results of review), based on findings \nfrom qualitative exploration (focus groups) with nine transgender-identified men and women.  \n1) use of transphobic and/or incorrectly gendered terminology includes using incorrect pronouns or \nderogatory language when addressing trans people. \n2) assumption of universal transgender experience encompasses when individuals assume that all \ntrans individuals are the same or expect certain gendered roles/stereotypes to be performed.  \n3) exoticization, occurs when trans people are treated as tokens or objects.  \n4)  discomfort/disapproval of transgender experience, occurs when an individual receives verbal or \nnon-verbal communications of disgust or discomfort following disclosure of the transgender status.  \n5) endorsement of gendernormative and binary culture or behaviours, reflects communications of \ngendered stereotypes (e.g. women assumed to be physically weaker than men), particularly when \nexperienced as incongruent to own gender identity (e.g. trans man assumed as weaker than cis \nman).  \n6) denial of existence of transphobia, manifests when minimise or deny the existence and impacts of \ntransphobia generally  \n7) denial of individual transphobia, occurs when individuals fail to consider their individual role in \nperpetrating transphobia.  \n8) assumption of sexual pathology or abnormality, refers to assumptions that trans identities are \npathological (e.g. occur as result of psychopathology or sexual deviance).  \n9) physical threat or harassment includes reports of being overtly threatened based on gender \nidentity   \n10) denial of bodily privacy occurs for example when trans individuals are asked intimate question \nregarding their body or when individuals visually assess trans individuals physical characteristics \nagainst gendered norms.   \n11) Familial microaggressions  \n12) Systemic and Environmental Microaggressions \n \n149 \n \nAppendix 1.15 \nReported effect sizes of significant results for included studies where appropriate. \nStudy \nNumber \nAuthors (year) Effect size/relative risk  \n1 AuBuchon (2019) \n \nDependent variable = Relational Value \nExperience of microaggression (microinsult, microinvalidation) = \n0.69* \nExperience of Macroaggression (microassault) = -0.69* \n2 Austin et al., \n(2019) \n \nN/A \n3 Austin et al., \n(2020) \n \nDependent variable = lifetime suicide attempt \nInterpersonal microaggressions - odds ratio [OR] = 1.1 \n \n4 Galupo et al., \n(2014) \n \nFor all nine categories, the frequency of microaggressions \nsignificantly differed across identity of friend, with effect sizes \nranging from medium to large. \n \n5 Howe (2019) \n \nThe average number of identity non-affirmation incidents per week \nincreased odds of: \n- Sadness/hopelessness OR = 3.26, 95% CI = [2.19, 5.11]. \n- Withdrawal OR = 3.45, 95% CI = [2.21, 5.78] \n- Past year suicidality OR = 2.21, 95% CI = [1.56, 3.30] \n- Lifetime suicidality OR = 2.60, 95% CI = [1.47, 5.23]  \n \nWith each increase in the number of identity non-affirmation or \ndenial microaggression incidents that transgender individuals \nreported as reducing their interest in engaging socially \n- odds of past-year sadness or hopelessness increased by 1.35 \ntimes, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = [1.17, 1.62] \n- odds of past-year withdrawal from regular activities \nincreased by 1.45 times, OR = 1.45, 95% CI = [1.21, 1.83] \n- odds of past-year suicide ideation increased by 1.32 times, \nOR = 1.32, 95% CI = [1.13, 1.60].  \n6 Morris et al., \n(2020) \n \nN/A \n7 Nadal et al., \n(2012) \n \nN/A \n8 Nadal et al., \n(2014), \n \nN/A \n9 Nadal et al., \n(2018) \n \nNR \n10 Pitcher (2017) \n \nN/A \n11 Parr et al.

Before you decide, you need to understand \nwhy the research is being done and what participation would involve. Please read the following \ninformation carefully. Talk to others about the study if you wish, and please ask if there is anything that is \nunclear or if you would like more information. \n \nWho is conducting the research? \nThe research is being carried out by Lisa Ballantyne, Trainee Clinical Psychologist, from the University of \nGlasgow. It is being supervised by Professor Rory O’Connor from the University of Glasgow and Dr Katie \nSmith from the Sandyford Gender Identity Clinic. \n \nWhat is the purpose of the study? \nThe study is being carried out as part of the requirements of the Doctorate in Clinical Psychology training \ncourse at the University of Glasgow. The purpose of the study is to try to better understand transgender \nindividuals’ experiences of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours. The study will involve \nspeaking to people whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth, who have \nhad thoughts of self-harm or suicide. The study aims to understand more about factors which may \ncontribute to thoughts of self-harm or suicide, and what factors influence how they may seek help when \nfeeling distressed. A better understanding of these factors may help people who are vulnerable to suicide. \n  \nWhy have I been invited? \nWe are looking to recruit between 4 and 10 people who have self-referred or are currently attending a \nScottish Gender Identity Clinic. Participants should be aged over 17 years old, whose gender identity is \ndifferent from their sex assigned at birth. To take part, participants should also have a history of self-harm \nand/or suicidal thoughts or behaviour.  \n \nWhat does taking part involve? \nIf you think that you fit the criteria and are interested in taking part, you can return the slip attached to \nyour invitation letter or email your interest to Lisa Ballantyne, the lead researcher \nResearcher Contact Information \nLisa Ballantyne, Trainee Clinical Psychologist \nEmail: l.ballantyne.2@research.gla.ac.uk \n \nInstitute of Mental Health & Well-being \nAdministration Building, 1st Floor \nGartnavel Royal Hospital \n1055 Great Western Road \nGlasgow G12 0XH \n \n \n \n160 \n \n(l.ballantyne.2@research.ac.uk). Lisa will then telephone you to tell you more about the study, answer any \nquestions you have, and, if you decide to take part, make an appointment for you to take part in an \ninterview. The interviews will take place at Sandyford Central (Glasgow) or Chalmers Centre (Edinburgh) \nand will last around 1 hour. This will feel like an informal discussion with the researcher about your \nexperiences of self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviour. You do not have to answer any questions \nthat you don’t want to and you can have breaks during the interview if you wish.  \n \nYou will be asked to complete a short risk assessment both before and after the interview. This will involve \nanswering a number of questions which are asked by the researcher to help identify if there are any \ncurrent risks to yourself or others that would need to be considered. The personal data generated by this \nwill be held for up to 3 years in accordance with relevant Data Protection policies and regulations; this is \ndiscussed in detail below.  \n \nIf you disclose anything during the interview or risk assessment that causes the researcher concern, such as \nbeing a risk to yourself or others, the researcher will have a duty to report this but will try to discuss this \nwith you before doing so.  \n \nWith your permission, the interview will be audio recorded so that the researcher can listen back to the \nconversation and identify the key points that you made. Some quotes from your interview may be included \nin the research paper, however all information will be anonymised. \n \nWe will write to your GP to tell them that you have taken part in this study. \n \nDo I have to take part? \nNo. It is up to you to decide if you want to take part in the study or not. If you agree to take part, you will \nbe asked to sign a consent form at the time of the interview to show that you have agreed to take part in \nthe study. You are free to withdraw from the study at any time until the research is written up, without \ngiving a reason. Withdrawing from the study would not affect the standard of care you receive or your \nfuture treatment in any way. \n \nWhat happens to the information? \nYour information will be held at the University of Glasgow. Your identity and personal information will be \ncompletely confidential and held in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; 2018), \nwhich means that we keep it safely and cannot reveal it to other people without your permission. NHS \nGG&C is the sponsor for this study based in the United Kingdom. We will be using information from you \nand/or your medical records in order to undertake this study and will act as the data controller for this \nstudy. We will store your personal data for up to 3 years. Anonymised data generated through interviews \nwill be stored for up to 10 years in the University of Glasgow archiving facilities in accordance with relevant \nData Protection policies and regulations. \n \nThe results of this study may be published in academic journals, conference proceedings and as a piece of \nwork for a doctoral qualification in Clinical Psychology. A summary of results will be made available to \nparticipants who would like feedback about the research once completed. Some direct quotes from your \ninterview may be included in these reports/publications, however all information will be anonymised with \npseudonyms and it will not be possible to personally identify you from this information.  \n \nYour rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as we need to manage your \ninformation in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate. If you withdraw from the \n \n161 \n \nstudy, we will keep the information about you that we have already obtained. To safeguard your rights, we \nwill use the minimum personally-identifiable information possible. \n \nYou can find out more about how we use your information at - \nhttps://www.nhsggc.org.uk/media/249727/gdpr-publish.pdf \n \nWhat are the possible benefits of taking part? \nWhilst your taking part will not have any direct impact on your own care, it is hoped that it will allow us to \nimprove our understanding of people with similar problems. You will contribute to research in this area \nwhich may help people who are at risk of self-harm or suicide. If, for any reason, you experience distress \nduring or after the interview, we will ensure that you are able to access appropriate sources of support, \nwhere these are required. \n \nWho has reviewed the study? \nThe study has been reviewed by the West of Scotland research ethics committee 3, the NHS Greater \nGlasgow and Clyde Research & Development Department, NHS Lothian Quality Improvement Team and \nthe NHS GGC Sandyford Research Governance Group (RGG).  \n \nIf you have any further questions: \nWe will give you a copy of the information sheet and signed consent form to keep.

Correlates \nof NSSI and suicidality within the trans-population are largely unknown due to limited high-quality \nresearch within this area. Furthermore, no research has explored trans-specific experiences of help-\nseeking for NSSI and suicidality to date. Help-seeking is an important factor in suicide prevention.  \nAims: To explore transgender individuals’ experiences of NSSI and suicidality, and how they make \nsense of these phenomena. Through this exploration, we hope to uncover factors which may \ncontribute to these experiences of NSSI and suicidality within this population. We also hope to \nfurther our understanding of transgender individuals’ perspectives on help-seeking. \nMethod: A qualitative design will be used. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a small \nsample of transgender adults who report a history of NSSI and/or suicidality. Interview transcripts \nwill then be analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). \nApplications: Identification of factors which influence NSSI, suicidality and help-seeking in the \ntransgender population will aid risk management and clinical interventions.  \n  \n \n178 \n \nNon-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidality among transgender people: understanding correlates \nand help-seeking. \n \n \n1. Introduction \nTransgender (or ‘trans’) people are individuals whose sense of felt gender (i.e. gender \nidentity) differs from the gender assumed at birth, on the basis of the sex they were assigned \n(Vincent, 2018). The term cisgender (or ‘cis’) describes individuals whose gender assumed at birth \nreflects their gender identity. The historical view of gender being wholly binary (e.g. male/female) \ndoes not accurately reflect the spectrum of gender expression (Richards et al., 2016). Therefore \ntransgender people may describe a number of different personal experiences of gender; including \ntransmen, transwomen, non-binary, gender diverse and genderqueer identities (Vincent, 2018). \nTrans people may also have a fluid gender identity and so may identify with more than one term at \nany given time, or the term they identify with may change over time (McNeil, Ellis & Eccles, 2017). \nImportantly, sexual orientation and gender identity are distinctly separate.  \n \n1.1 Non-suicidal self-injury and suicidality \nResearch has consistently shown that  trans individuals are more at risk of suicide than the \ncisgender population (Adams, Hitomi & Moody, 2017; Clements-Nolle, Marx and Katz, 2006; Haas, \nRodgers & Herman, 2014; McNeil et al., 2017; Peterson, Matthews, Copps-Smith & Conard, 2017; \nResiner et al., 2014). This disparity is also true when compared to other marginalised groups. For \nexample, within the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) group, trans individuals are more \nlikely to attempt suicide than the LGB population (Haas et al., 2014; Mustanski & Liu, 2013). One UK \ntrans mental health survey (McNeil, Bailey, Ellis, Regan, & Morton, 2012) noted that the majority of \nrespondents (84%) indicated current or historical suicidal ideation, with 48% of these individuals \nhaving attempted suicide at least once. A total of 51% and 11% of transgender adults report past \nyear suicide ideation and attempts, respectively, across the USA and Canada (Adams et al., 2017). \nSimilarly, Viripukasha, Muralidhar and Ramakrishna (2016) found lifetime rates of suicide attempts \nwithin the trans population to be between 32% and 52% globally. These prevalence rates are \nsubstantially higher than the cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation (9.2%) and \nattempts (2.7%) within the general population (Nock et al., 2008).  \n \nA higher prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) also exists within the trans population \n(between 19% and 39%), compared to the cis population (Marshall et al., 2016). NSSI, or self-harm, \nrefers to intention self-inflicted damage one's own body tissue without suicidal ideation, and not \nconsistent with cultural norms. Methods of NSSI include cutting, burning, scratching, and hitting \noneself, which have been found to serve a variety of functions including affect regulation, self-\npunishment and social functions (Cipriano, Cella & Cotrufo, 2017).  \n \nA history of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts are known risk factors of dying \nby suicide within the general population (Chan et al., 2017). However, despite the high prevalence \nrates of NSSI and suicidal behaviour within the trans population, the lifetime prevalence of trans \nindividuals dying by suicide is currently unknown (Wolford-Clevenger, Cannon, Flores, Smith & \nStuart, 2017). The lack of data in this area may reflect challenges in recording trans identities at time \nof death (McNeil et al., 2017). Although research within the transgender population has increased \nover recent years, this population is still vastly understudied. The high rates of NSSI and suicidality \namong trans people highlights the importance of continued research within this area, aimed at \nimproving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population. \n \n1.2 Correlates of NSSI and Suicidality \n \n179 \n \nA recent systematic review by McNeil et al. (2017) summarised the correlates of suicidal ideation \nand behaviours within the trans population. Environmental factors, specifically those related to \nminority stressors (e.g. discrimination, victimisation and social stigma), were identified as strongly \nrelated to suicidal ideation and attempts. Individual factors, such as co-morbid mental health \ndifficulties and internalised transphobia, were also discussed as risk factors for ideation and \nattempts. Conversely, positive social interactions and timely access to interventions were noted as \nprotective. Notably, trans individuals are not biologically predisposed to psychopathology, nor do \nthey experience mental health difficulties differently from the cis population (Robles et al., 2016). \nOlsen et al., (2016) found that normative levels of mental health difficulties can be observed if \nindividuals (in this case trans youth) are socially supported in their chosen gender identity, \nsuggesting that psychopathology is not inherently part of a trans identity and again highlighting the \nprotective nature of positive social interactions. \n \nSimilar risk factors have been described for NSSI among trans people, including \ndiscrimination, perceived lack of social support and interpersonal problems (Marshalle et al., 2016). \nLiterature suggests that transmen (female-to-male) are particularly at risk of NSSI (Holt, Skagerburg \n& Dunsford, 2016; Peterson et al., 2017). One hypothesis is that being born phenotypically female \nmay increase an individual’s risk of NSSI, as ciswomen are more at risk of self-harm than cismen \n(Marshalle et al., 2016). Further research is required to explore the relationship between specific \ngender identities and NSSI. The relationship between NSSI and suicidality within the trans population \nrequires further attention; however recent research suggests a positive correlation between NSSI \nand suicide attempt history (Wolford-Clevenger, Smith, Flores & Stuart, 2018).  \n \nWolford-Clevenger et al. (2018) systematically reviewed the literature from January 1991 to \nJuly 2017, to describe separately the correlates of ideation and attempts. Guided by an ideation-to-\naction framework (Klonsky & May, 2014), the authors described a number of internal and external \nminority stress experiences (e.g. prejudice/discrimination, victimisation, expectations of rejection, \nself-stigma) which, in combination, potentially contribute to psychological pain and thus drive \nsuicidal ideation. In parallel with the general suicide literature, a positive correlation was found \nbetween suicide attempt history and fearsome and painful events among trans people. These events \ninclude both physical and sexual violence, substance misuse and, as discussed, NSSI. However, in \ncontrast with our understanding that key fearful and physically painful events shift ideation toward \nattempts, internalised minority stressors were also positively correlated with a move from ideation \nto action for trans people. Further research efforts are needed to understand the factors which may \ncontribute to a trans person’s capacity for suicide, particularly when considering the generalisation \nof existing suicide frameworks to a population which encompasses a range of uniquely trans-specific \nexperiences.  \n \nNotably, this review highlighted the poor methodological quality of research within this area, \nwith only 15% of the 45 included studies rated as good quality. Methodology was often limited by \ndichotomous measuring (e.g. lifetime prevalence vs absence) of both ideation (58% of studies) and \nattempts (80% of studies). Furthermore, of the studies which reported correlates of suicide \nattempts, none defined the key aspect of ‘intent to die’ (Freedenthal, 2007) when measuring \nattempted suicides. Thus the authors noted that any conclusions drawn regarding the correlates of \nsuicidality in trans people should be considered tentatively, again highlighting the need for further \nempirical research in this area. Further qualitative research may help to provide context to the \nmechanisms underlying NSSI and suicidality risk for trans people.  \n \n1.3 Help-seeking behaviours \nTo date, no research has explored help-seeking for NSSI and suicidality specifically within the adult \ntrans population. Help-seeking is an important factor in suicide prevention. Within the general \n \n180 \n \npopulation, research has sought to understand the formal (medical professionals and mental health \nservices) and informal (self-help, social) help-seeking behaviours of individuals experiencing NSSI or \nsuicidal distress (Hom, Stanley & Joiner, 2015; Rowe et al., 2014). Individual demographic factors \n(e.g. education level, socioeconomic status, culture, race, gender, age) influence the likelihood that a \nperson will seek help when experiencing suicidal distress (Niederkrotenthaler et al., 2014). The \nexistence of these group-specific differences, in addition to the substantial impact of attitudes and \nstigma on help-seeking (Calear, Batterham & Christensen, 2014), suggest that further suicide \nprevention research is needed to understand the underlying processes of trans-specific help-seeking \nbehaviours.  \n \nWhilst exploring help-seeking in LGBT women who report general mental health difficulties, \nMcNair and Bush (2016) found that transwomen reported barriers to seeking help including; fear \nof/prior experience of prejudice and/or discrimination (71%), concerns that providers will not be \nwell informed/trans-sensitive (38%), and lack of readiness (45%). These findings appear in line with \nliterature exploring both physical and mental health care use by trans people. The literature \ndiscusses experiences of/fear of stigma and discrimination within a healthcare context, fear of social \nconsequences, and a belief that their needs will not be met, as barriers to transgender people fully \nutilising professional health services (Shipherd, Greene & Abramovitz, 2010; Poteat, German & \nKerrigan, 2013).  \n \nA study by Effrig, Bieschke & Locke (2011) compared reported levels of psychological distress \nbetween treatment seeking and non-treatment seeking trans college students. They concluded that \nthere was no significant difference in levels of psychological distress between groups, however, \nhigher levels of suicidal ideation within the treatment-seeking group was observed. The authors \nhypothesised that trans people may be more likely to seek help only when a crisis point is reached. \nMethodological limitations however, including inclusion/exclusion criteria for each group, suggest \ninterpretation of these results should be tentative.  However, a recent study by McDermott, Hughes \nand Rawlings (2017) may lend some support for this hypothesis. \n \nMcDermott et al., (2017) explored LGBT youth suicidality, self-harm and help-seeking \n(formal and informal). Like much of the transgender research, trans people were amalgamated \nwithin the LGBT category, thus significantly limiting our ability to draw informed conclusions on \ntrans-specific experiences. Additionally, this study focused on youth LGBT (mean age 18) and so \nresults were likely influenced by age-related variables. Nevertheless, this mixed-methods study \nserves as an initial starting point in exploring the process of help-seeking in trans people who \nexperience suicidal distress. Qualitative interviews (41% of respondents were ‘trans or other’) \nidentified three main themes that pose a challenge to help-seeking; negotiating norms (managing a \nheteronormative1 environment and fear of stigma), inability to discuss emotions (lack of \ntrust/confidence speaking about difficulties, negotiating disclosure of LGBT status), and self-reliance \n(viewing help-seeking as a weakness, maladaptive strategies viewed as positive coping).  \n \nSimilar to Effric et al., (2011), the authors concluded that LGBT individuals often normalise \ntheir psychological distress and so are more likely to seek help only when at a crisis point. \nInterestingly, McDermott et al., (2017) also reported being transgender, planned/attempted suicide, \nNSSI, and experience of abuse related to gender identity/sexual orientation as significant predictors \nof help-seeking for suicidality. However, they did not control for the possibility that trans individuals \nmay experience these additional predictors at a higher frequency than cisgender individuals, which \nmay in turn mediate the increased likelihood that trans people will seek support.  \n                                                          \n1\n Heteronormativity refers to the assumption that a binary gender identity (in line with sex assigned at birth) \nand heterosexuality are the norm. This often leads to the “othering” of people who do not conform to these \nassumed norms.  \n \n181 \n \n \n2. Aims \nThe principal aim of the proposed research is to explore the lived experience of transgender \nindividuals who report a history of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and/or suicidal thoughts or \nbehaviours, in order to better understand their experiences. The researcher will be guided by the \nparticipants in terms of themes for discussion, however the proposed research will explore the \nfollowing topics; i) transgender individuals’ experiences of any psychosocial factors which may \nincrease or decrease the likelihood that NSSI and/or suicidality will occur, and ii) their experiences of \nhelp-seeking in the context of experiencing NSSI and/or suicidality.  \n \n3. Plan \n3.1 Design \nThe proposed study will be of qualitative design. Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be \nconducted, and analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) framework.  \n \n3.2 Participants \nParticipants will be recruited from the both the NHS GGC and NHS Lothian Gender Identity Clinic’s. \nParticipants will be asked to (1) describe their gender identity and (2) identify the sex they were \nassigned at birth. The study will also collect socio-demographic data (e.g. age, race, religion, \nsexuality, postcode) to help account for intersectional experiences. \n \n3.3 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  \nInclusion criteria: (i) gender identity which is incongruent with sex assigned at birth (ii) report a \nhistory of NSSI and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviours (iii) aged 17 or over (iv) fluent in English. \nExclusion criteria: (i) known forensic history or (ii) at imminent risk of suicide (assessed before \nparticipation).  \n \n3.4 Justification of Sample Size \nInterpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) embraces a “less is more” stance, suggesting that it is \nmore desirable to explore themes from smaller sample sizes in great depth, as opposed to recruiting \na larger sample which may provide broader, shallower, more descriptive themes (Reid, Flowers & \nLarkin, 2005). Therefore, studies employing IPA generally recruit between one and ten participants \n(Starks & Trinidad 2007). The proposed study seeks to recruit between 4 and 10 participants, which \nis the recommend total of participants for doctoral research (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009).  \n \nThe sample size is considered feasible as the NHS Gender Identity Clinic’s accept a large \nnumber of referrals onto their waiting list each year. Additionally, given the high prevalence of a \nhistory NSSI and suicidality within the trans population (McNeil et al., 2017), it is not anticipated that \napplication of the inclusion criteria will significantly limit the number of potential participants. There \nare currently 531 individuals on the waiting list for GGC Sandyford (as of 18/01/2019) and the \nservice accepts approximately 30 new adult referrals each month. The proposed sample size \nrepresents only 0.75% to 1.88% of the potential participant pool prior to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  \n \n3.5 Recruitment Procedures \nParticipants will be recruited from two Gender Identity Clinics within NHS Scotland; the Sandyford \nCentre (NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; GGC) and the Chalmers Centre (NHS Lothian). Potential \nparticipants will be identified from the adult service at these clinics during a number of points of \ncontact; initial waiting list, initial assessment, and internal waiting list for medical review. Gender \nIdentity Clinics are not considered mental health services; however they provide support to any \nperson who feels uncomfortable or uncertain about their gender identity or expression of their \ngender. Their primary role is to assist transgender people to facilitate social, medical and surgical \n \n182 \n \ntreatments that enable greater comfort in the face of gender non-conformity. Both clinics accept \nreferrals from other health professionals (e.g. GP), whilst GGC Sandyford centre also self-referrals. \nPrior consent to be contacted for research purposes is sought at the point of self-referral and at \ninitial appointment. Anyone who has not provided consent to be contacted for research purposes (at \ninitial appointment or at time of self-referral) will be omitted from any invites. \nThe clinics provide a national service to any individuals registered with a GP in Scotland.  Individuals \non the waiting list for initial partnership appointment are not considered GGC/Lothian patients \nunless they are registered at a GP within these health board areas. Once individuals are open to the \ngender identity clinic following initial contact, they are then considered NHS GGC/Lothian patients \n(dependent on location).  \nA number of recruitment strategies will be employed to increase the likelihood that the required \nnumber of participants will be recruited. These are summarised below  \nRecruitment strategy one: Following initial assessment, individuals are then placed on an internal \nwaiting list for medical review. Individuals who are on the waiting list for medical review and have \nprovided consent to be contacted for research purposes will be sent information pertaining to the \nstudy (e.g. inclusion criteria, purpose of study), and invited to participate.  \nRecruitment strategy two: Clinical staff will be provided with information regarding the study, \nincluding inclusion/exclusion criteria. Clinical staff conducting initial assessments will be asked to \nintroduce the study and provide study information packs to individuals who have indicated that they \nwould like to be contacted for research purposes and who may meet inclusion criteria for the study.  \nRecruitment strategy three: Individuals who have self-referred and have provided consent to be \ncontacted for research purposes will be sent information pertaining to the study (e.g. inclusion \ncriteria, purpose of study), and invited to participate. NHS Lothian does not accept self-referrals and \nso recruitment strategy three will only be employed at NHS GG&C Sandyford Centre.  Only \nindividuals who are registered with GP in Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board Area will be \nidentified from the partnership waiting list.  \nAfter receiving an information pack, potential participants will be asked to provide consent for the \nresearcher to contact them should they wish to take part, either by returning the enclosed consent \nform or by emailing written consent to the researcher. They will then be contacted directly by \ntelephone by the researcher (following a period of at least 24 hours) who will provide any further \ninformation that is required and arrange a time for interview at the convenience of participants. A \nformal assessment of suicidal risk will be administered by the researcher prior to/following each \ninterview. This standardised risk screening protocol is extensively used by the Suicidal Research \nBehaviour Laboratory (see Appendix 1). Additionally, the researcher (Lisa Ballantyne) is a final year \nTrainee Clinical Psychologist with experience in conducting formal risk assessments, including suicide \nrisk, within clinical mental health settings. The research has also undertaken a number of additional \ntraining courses aimed at suicide awareness, risk assessment, and prevention (e.g. ASSIST Training, \nSTORM training, FACE CARAS). Any individual identified as at imminent risk of suicide at any stage of \nthe interview will be referred immediately to the appropriate Crisis Service.  \n3.6 Setting and Equipment \n \n183 \n \nAll interviews will be conducted in a clinical setting within Sandyford Central (Glasgow) or \nChalmers Centre (Edinburgh). A recorder, transcription kit, and laptop will be borrowed from The \nUniversity of Glasgow \n \n3.7 Methodology \nInterviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed before being analysed using Interpretative \nPhenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided by Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009). IPA is a qualitative \napproach which explores the processes whereby individuals make sense of their subjective lived \nexperiences. IPA relies on an inductive approach which invites individuals, viewed as experts of their \nown experiences, to share their accounts of a given phenomenon. Participants are afforded the \nopportunity to reflect on their own experiences and express their ideas, whilst sharing their detailed \nfirst-hand stories with the researcher during interview (Smith et al. 2009).  \n \n3.8 Qualitative Interviews \nOne-on-one semi-structured interviews, lasting approximately one hour, will be conducted by the \nprimary researcher. An interview schedule will be used to help structure these interviews, although \nthis will be a limited guide and will not be followed rigidly. Instead, this guide will support \nparticipants to reflect on the experiences which they deem central to the given topic, in line with \nIPA’s inductive stance.  \n \n3.9 Data Analysis  \nEach participant’s data (e.g. claims, concerns and understandings) will be analysed line by line \nthrough transcription and coding. Emergent themes will then be identified, focusing convergence \nand divergence, commonality and nuance. This interpretation will be a dialogue between the \nresearcher, the coded data, and their knowledge, when considering what it might mean for \nparticipants to have these concerns, in this context. A structure will then be developed to \ndemonstrate the relationships between themes, before then forming a more cohesive narrative. The \ncoherence and plausibility of themes will be tested through the use of supervision. \n \n3.10 Data Management Plan \nPersonal data will be recorded on consent forms which will be stored in a locked filing cabinet at the \nUniversity of Glasgow. Each consent form (with personal identifiable information) will be given a \nunique code. Each interview will audio recording will be stored on an encrypted USB stick provided \nby the University of Glasgow. Only the researcher (Lisa Ballantyne) will have access to these audio \nfiles. Recordings will be backed up on a password protected part of the University network and will \nbe destroyed at the end of the study. Each recording will be transcribed verbatim and all \nidentifiable information will be removed to preserve the anonymity of participants and pseudonyms \nwill be applied. A unique code for each participant will be noted on the anonymised data, which will \nlink to identifiable information held separately. Recordings and transcripts will be treated in \naccordance with the General Data Protection Regulations (2018) and NHS Confidentiality Code of \nPractice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality (2002). The University of Glasgow will retain personal \ndata for between 12 months and 3 years due to the typical time required for publication exceeding \n12 months. Research data generated by the study will be stored for 10 years. The research data will \nbe stored in a locked filing cabinet at the premises of the Institute of Health & Well-being at \nGartnavel Royal Hospital. \n \n4. Health and Safety \nThe researcher will receive regular supervision by the local clinical supervisor. All interviews will take \nplace on NHS clinical grounds and the appropriate local health and safety guidelines will be followed, \nthus reducing the risk to both researcher and participants. Participant safety issues are discussed in \nfurther detail below in section 5 (ethical issues). \n \n184 \n \n \n5. Ethics \nPrior to commencing research, ethical approval will be requested from the West of Scotland \nResearch Committee and the Sandyford Research Governance Group (RGG).  \n \n5.1 Informed Consent \nThe voluntary and confidential nature of participation will be made explicit. Participants will be \nassured that they can withdraw their participation at any time. Written consent will be obtained \nprior to interview.  \n \n5.2 Risk of Coercion \nInformation provided (information sheet/verbal discussions) will stress that participation is voluntary \nand the decision to participate or not will not affect their care.  \n \n5.3 Data Protection and Confidentiality \nParticipants will also be assured that their data will be anonymised and will remain confidential and \nlimits of confidentiality will be explained. Pseudonyms will be used for the duration of the interview \nand during analysis.  \n \n5.4 Potential Distress \nThe potentially sensitive topic will be acknowledged and participants will be advised that they are \nnot required to answer any questions they do not wish to. In the unlikely event that a participant \ndoes become distressed, they will be encouraged to discuss any issues with their GP. A field \nsupervisor will available while the interviews are taking place should immediate support be required. \nParticipants will be provided with a list of contacts for further local/ culturally inclusive support. As \nnoted, a risk screening tool will be used at the start and end of every interview to ascertain risk of \nsuicide specifically. An action plan will be in place should any participant disclose information \nsuggesting that they may be at imminent risk.  \n \n5.5 Transgender Health Research \nAdams, Pearce, Veale et al. (2017) highlighted further ethical considerations needed for transgender \nhealth research, including the potential for distressed caused by misgendering individuals or by using \nstigmatising language. The language and procedures used will be guided by collaboration with local \ntrans groups (e.g. Scottish Trans Alliance).  \n \n6. Finance \nThe University of Glasgow will fund the costs involved in printing, photocopying, and posting of the \nresearch information packs. \n \n7. Proposed Timetable \nJanuary 2019:     Proposal submission \nApril-October 2019:    Ethics \nNovember-January 2019:  Data collection \nFebruary 2019:    Review point \nFebruary-March 2020:   Data Coding/analysis \nApril-July 2020:    Write-up/Submission \n \n8. Practical Applications \nIdentification of factors which increase or decrease NSSI and suicidality for transgender people will \nin turn aid risk management and inform clinical interventions. Given the importance of help-seeking \nbehaviours in preventing suicide, identification of factors which influence these behaviours within \n \n185 \n \nthe transgender population may provide important considerations for both policy and service \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe results of this study will be submitted as a piece of work for a doctoral qualification in Clinical \nPsychology. The results may also be published in academic journals, conference proceedings and a \nsummary of results will be made available to participants who would like feedback about the \nresearch once completed. \n   \n9.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Transgender individuals are substantially more likely to report self-harm and suicidality than both cisgender individuals and other LGBT individuals. The psychosocial factors underlying self-harm and suicidality within the trans population, and how they may lead to suicidal ideation or attempts, remain largely under-researched. Protective factors, such as resilience and help-seeking may help to reduce risk of suicide within the trans population, however further research is required to examine these processes. Similarly, exploring trans-specific experiences of help-seeking for suicidal distress is important when considering suicide prevention. Further empirical research, aimed at improving our understanding and prevention of suicide within this population, is imperative.\n\n\n\nMethod:  A qualitative design was used. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with transgender adults (n=4) in Scotland, who reported a history of self-harm and/or suicidality. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).\n\n\n\nResults: Four superordinate themes emerged, each with inter-related subordinate themes. 1) “Early Experiences”: How individuals made sense of early experiences which increased their self-harm and suicidal distress. 2) “Intent”: The motives underlying participants’ self-harm and suicidality. 3) “Hope and Resilience”: The protective resilience factors that reduced participants’ self-harm and suicidal distress. 4) “Threats to Resilience”: How participants made sense of additional minority stressors that were relevant to their experiences.\n\n\n\nConclusion: The current study suggests that transgender individuals may experience psychosocial factors related to self-harm and suicidality differently across various stages of their lives. Important insights into the motivations underlying self-harm and suicidality for transgender individuals emerged. Clinical implications are discussed, however further research is required to fully understand self-harm and suicidality within the transgender community",
