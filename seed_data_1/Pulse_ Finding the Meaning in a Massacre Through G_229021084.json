INTRODUCTIONIn the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, a hate-filled man calmlyopened fire on the patrons of the Pulse nightclub in downtown Orlando,Florida.' Over the next three hours, he killed forty-nine men and womenwho had been celebrating Latin Night at the gay club.2 Fifty-three per-sons were wounded.' When police finally entered the club and killed themurderer, nothing could be heard but the sounds of cell phones ringing.'One officer who entered that ghastly scene said it felt like all of the peo-ple on the floor were \"playing dead.\"'We mourned. We mourned another mass shooting of innocents. Wewent to vigils6 and held up candles of hope. We held up photos of thoseslain.' We built memorials with flowers, flags, photographs, banners, can-1.

From a critical perspective, this article uses intersectionality in the sense of a conflu-ence of multilayered systems of subordination and privilege that are mutually reinforcingin complex ways to oppress lives of individuals and social groups. From a constructiveperspective, this article understands intersectionality as a key concept for the ongoing pro-ject of liberation and eschews the term post-intersectionality. See, e.g., Sumi Cho, Under-standing White Women's Ambivalence Towards Affirmative Action, Theorizing PoliticalAccountability in Coalitions, 71 UMKC L. REV. 399, 403 n.29 (2002) (criticizing the use ofthe term \"post-intersectionality\").

FINDING MEANING: THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCEIN ENLIGHTENMENT THINKINGTo critique the violence that undergirded the massacre at Pulse, thisarticle first looks to the Enlightenment era, which produced patterns ofthinking that shape modern Western law, philosophy, ethics, and every-day consciousress.2 9 Beginning in the sixteenth century, Enlightenmentphilosophers turned from the authority of religious dogma to embraceReason.3 0 Dualistic structures of thought were the foundation of thisfresh turn to rationality.\" Philosophers organized their thinking aroundbinaries such as reason/passion,3 2 public/private,3 3 and mind/body,34which became silently insinuated as prevailing structures of thought.3 5Western legal thinking reflects this dualistic pattern: judge/jury, plaintiff/defendant, law/facts, and direct/cross. Being true to its philosophical her-itage, modern consciousness is also shot through with binaries: good/bad,29. According to Issak Dore:The major figures of the Enlightenment period, or Age of Reason (roughly from Hob-bes to Kant), were aware that they were participants in a broad intellectual projectthat had two important and related goals, namely, to reject past claims to knowledgebased on authority and to construct an edifice of knowledge based not on authoritybut on reason and science.ISAAK 1.

When an individual is defined as different from the subject (and istherefore an object), violence is justified.4 2 What is being attacked is nota thinking, feeling, and hurting human being, but an object that is devoidof family, feelings, hopes, and dreams.Related to the subject/object binary is the early feminist idea of the\"Other.\"4 3 As a \"fundamental category of philosophical thought\" inmodernist thinking, otherness is defined by the dominant subject as thatwhich is incidental and inessential to itself.4 4 More perniciously, subjectgroups set up others in inferior and excluded positions.

To elaborate, Iris Marion Young catalogues threelevels of consciousness: discursive, practical, and basic security.86 At thelevel of discursive consciousness, actions and interactions are verbalized,grounded on explicit verbal foundation, or can be verbalized easily.\" Inpractical consciousness, actions and interactions are not verbalized, butare founded on \"habitual, routinized background awareness\" of the envi-ronment while the person is engaged in actions such as driving to thegrocery store.8 8 The basic security area includes matters of identity andautonomy, along with unconscious motivations.8 9Young suggests that bias against historically subordinated groups hasreceded from discursive consciousness and now takes place at the levelsof practical consciousness and the unconscious.90 A significant reason forthe shift of bias into habitual and unconscious levels is the articulatedpublic commitment in the United States to formal equality.91 Not only isoutright discrimination prohibited, but many segments of the public alsoembrace formal equality as part of their belief systems and demonstratethat commitment in forms of public etiquette.92However, the anti-immigrant discourse illustrates a troubling trajectoryin bias toward Latina/os.

According to the report, many victims perceived to beimmigrants are also members of other protected groups.9 6 This findingunderscores the claim that forms of oppression experienced by subordi-nated people are interstructured by race, color, ethnicity, class, sexual ori-entation, gender identity, and religion, to name a few of the predominantgroup identities claimed by and imposed on people.97 Recognizing op-pression as intersectional is a framework reflecting the lived reality of aperson's constructed identities at the confluence of \"intersecting and mu-tually reliant systems of oppression\" and privilege.9 8 Furthermore, the94.

Yet, privilege-normalized benefitsthat invisibly flow to those favored by race, gender, sexuality, or class-isthe engine that keeps the roiling systems of oppression going.145 Whiteprivilege, for example, has been called \"an invisible package of unearnedassets\" that a white person counts on cashing each day, while remainingoblivious of its existence.14 6Privilege plays an important role in discursive, intersectional justice be-cause it allows the bearers of privilege to \"opt out of struggles againstoppression if they choose.\"147 Opting out of liberatory struggles is oftendone with silence.1 4 8 A white person can say nothing when a racist\"joke\" is uttered.

Johnson observed that the national discourse onimmigration has been captured by restrictionist politicians who have cre-ated inflammatory and contrapuntal \"metaphorical wars\" on drugs andterror, blaming immigrants for both categories of social ills.2 63 In the dis-course of immigration law, three metaphors are dominant: \"IMMI-GRANTS ARE ALIENS, IMMIGRATION IS A FLOOD, andIMMIGRATION IS AN INVASION.\" 2 6 4 Of these, the dominant legalmetaphor is \"alien,\" which conveys three qualities: otherness, ethnicity,and illegality.2 65Fear of the \"Other\" fuels anti-immigrant sentiment and discourse.2 66To carry the critique further, the Other is considered to be \"the for-eigner,\" who serves as the subordinating role in a native/alien binary.2 67The role of the alien is distinctly racial; immigrants occupy \"a racial casteof workers relegated to a secondary labor market.\"2 68 In addition, thecharacter of the alien has been distinctly criminalized; the history of im-migration law is one of \"crimmigration\" that targets specific groupsdeemed undesirable due to race, national origin, or ethnicity.26 9As discussed earlier, the surge in violent hate crimes toward Latina/osis linked to hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric.270 Some perpetrators of hatecrimes against Latinos have directly attributed their violence to anti-im-migrant speech.27 1 In addition, some public figures have specifically262.
