Colorado Civil Rights \nCommission, a case that centers on a wedding cake baker \nwho refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple. The case \nis one example of debates occurring across the country over \ntensions between religious freedom and LGBTQ (lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) rights. In the wake of \nmarriage equality for same-sex couples, many states have \nintroduced and passed laws that provide “religious \nexemptions” for certain services and benefits for LGBTQ1 \npersons. These laws allow individuals to make decisions in \ntheir work environments that may violate civil rights laws \nbut that uphold their religious conviction that fundamentally \nopposes nonheterosexual relationships and transgender iden-\ntities. Although wedding-related services (such as wedding \ncakes) have garnered the most media attention, the bills pro-\nvide protection for religious exceptions in a wide range of \nservices. For instance, in Mississippi, mental health care \nproviders can refuse to treat LGBTQ people. In South \nDakota, North Dakota, and Michigan, employees in adoption \nand foster care services can legally refuse to place children \nwith LGBTQ parents. In the first half of 2017, 93 anti-LGBT \nbills were debated, 42 of which were religious exemption \nlaws, and 60 pro-LGBT bills were debated (American Civil \nLiberties Union 2017).2 The prevalence of both religious \nfreedom bills and laws protecting LGBTQ people following \nmarriage equality underscores that these laws expose \n760413 SRDXXX10.1177/2378023118760413SociusKazyak et al.\nresearch-article2018\n1University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, USA\n2Mathematica Policy Research, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEmily Kazyak, University of Nebraska–Lincoln, 725 Oldfather Hall, \nLincoln, NE 68588, USA.\nEmail: ekazyak2@unl.edu\nLogics of Freedom: Debating  \nReligious Freedom Laws and  \nGay and Lesbian Rights\nEmily Kazyak1, Kelsy Burke1, and Mathew Stange2\nAbstract\nIn the wake of marriage equality for same-sex couples, many states have introduced and passed laws that provide \nreligious exemptions for certain services and benefits for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) \npersons. The authors use data from a general population survey of Nebraskans as a mixed-methods case study to \nexamine public opinion of religious freedom laws. Drawing on data from both closed-ended (n = 1,117) and open-\nended (n = 838) questions, the authors show that opposition to religious freedom laws is quite high, as 64 percent \nof respondents report that they oppose laws that would allow business owners to deny services to gay men and \nlesbians. The authors outline how both sides rely on frameworks that are foundational to the American experience: \nthe protection of rights and the capitalist economy. The authors argue that these appeals to broad American values \nunderscore why these bills will continue to be introduced and seen as controversial despite low levels of support.\nKeywords\npublic opinion, sexuality, LGBT rights, religious freedom\n1We use the term LGBTQ when discussing religious freedom legis-\nlation to reflect the fact that these bills affect a range of nonhetero-\nsexual or nonbinary individuals. Given that the question from the \nsurvey data we analyze refers to “gay men or lesbians,” we use the \nphrase “gay men and lesbians” when discussing our findings.\n2The American Civil Liberties Union defines pro-LGBT bills as \nlegislation that offers comprehensive or incomplete protection \nfrom discrimination for sexual orientation and/or gender identity. It \nidentifies anti-LGBT bills as antitransgender (regulating single-sex \nfacility restrooms, identification documents, health care, and other); \nFirst Amendment defense acts; religious freedom restoration acts; \nreligious exemptions related to health care access, adoption and \nfoster care, marriage-related exemptions, and other; and preventive \nmeasures against nondiscrimination protection for LGBTQ people.\n2 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \ncontemporary debates over freedom, as gay rights and reli-\ngious rights are pitted against each other.\nPublic opinion polling about religious freedom laws, how-\never, is limited. National surveys have found that the public is \nmore closely divided on religious freedom laws than current \npublic opinion about same-sex marriage, which is largely \naffirming (McCarthy 2014, 2016, 2017; Silver 2013). \nAccording to the Pew Research Center (2016a, 2016d), \nAmericans are less likely to oppose a same-sex couple’s right \nto marry (37 percent) than to support laws that allow busi-\nnesses to refuse to provide wedding-related services to same-\nsex couples (48 percent) or that require transgender people to \nuse the public restroom that aligns with the gender they were \nassigned at birth (46 percent). Data from a national survey \nexperiment further underscore the division, with 53 percent \nsupporting denial of services to a hypothetical gay couple \nseeking wedding photography (Powell, Schnabel, and Apgar \n2017). Missing from these data is an explanation of why indi-\nviduals support or oppose religious freedom legislation.\nIn this study, we use data from a general population sur-\nvey of Nebraskans as a mixed-methods case study to exam-\nine public opinion of religious freedom laws that directly \nreference sexual minorities. We first analyze the percentages \nof respondents who favored and opposed religious freedom \nlaws and how support for religious freedom laws differs \nacross demographic, political, and religious groups. We then \nanalyze respondents’ written explanations of why they favor \nor oppose the rights of business owners to refuse service to \ngay men and lesbians. Analysis of the open-ended survey \nresponses reveals that individual attitudes about religious \nfreedom issues do not neatly map onto past findings about \npeople’s attitudes toward same-sex sexuality or same-sex \nmarriage. Instead, individuals on both sides of the religious \nfreedom issue draw on similar logics to support their clash-\ning views. On the basis of analysis of more than 800 open-\nended responses, we find that respondents rely on similar \nlogics to justify their opinions: individual rights and the free \nmarket. These frameworks are overlapping and represent \nshared representations of American identity (Blair-Loy 2001; \nBonikowski 2017; Brubaker 2004). Yet they reveal how \nrespondents connect opposite viewpoints to widely shared \nvalues and how religious freedom debates gain so much trac-\ntion and tension in contemporary American politics.\nCultural Schemas: Rights and Free \nMarket\nTo analyze how people make sense of religious freedom laws \nrelated to LGBTQ individuals, we draw on insights from cul-\ntural sociology that underscores the importance of shared \nmeaning and frameworks in social life (Hays 2000; Sewell \n1999; Swidler 1986). In particular, we are interested in the \n“cultural schemas” that guide how people respond to the \nhypothetical scenario of a business owner serving (or not \nserving) a gay or lesbian customer (Di Maggio 1997; Sewell \n2001). Cultural schemas refer to the “socially constructed \nframeworks,” “shared, publicly available understandings” \n(Blair-Loy 2001:689), or “overarching shared representations \nof particular domains of social life” (Bonikowski 2017:9). \nThese schemas help organize information coherently and \nguide interpretations and action. In this way, analyzing how \npeople explain their support for or opposition to religious \nfreedom legislation sheds lights on the cultural schemas sur-\nrounding some of the most salient values in contemporary \nAmerica: freedom, rights, capitalism, and diversity.\nAs we will describe, public support for the protection of \nChristian business owners who refuse service to gays and \nlesbians implicitly or explicitly rejects the notion that \ninequalities related to sexual orientation (heterosexuality \nprivileged over nonheterosexuality) or religion (Christianity \nprivileged over secularism or other religions) are embedded \nwithin American democracy. Yet importantly, scholars argue \nthat issues of power and inequality penetrate social ideolo-\ngies, or “common sense,” that reflect only a dominant group’s \nperspective (Bonilla Silva 2006; Duggan 2004; Levitsky \n2014). For instance, scholars argue that the shared frame-\nwork of the American dream and meritocracy masks how \nclass, race, and gender inequalities shape people’s opportuni-\nties (McNamee and Miller 2009). When making sense of \ndiversity, another cultural schema, Americans frame an indi-\nvidual’s unique identity as a positive aspect of a diverse soci-\nety but downplay or disparage group-level differences, such \nas those that harm communities of color and privilege major-\nity-white communities (Bell and Hartmann 2007). A related \nexample is how many Americans, including some people of \ncolor, share a “color-blind” understanding about race that is \nbased on white supremacy (Bonilla-Silva 2006). Identity \nmarkers including race (white), religion (Christian), and sex-\nuality (heterosexual) are salient in representations of who is \nand is not American (Canaday 2009; Parker and Barreto \n2013; Theiss-Morse 2009). Debates over religious freedom \nlaws directed toward gays and lesbians highlight current ten-\nsions related to whose freedom and rights should be pro-\ntected, who is and is not in danger of being harmed, and how \nbest to remedy potential harms people may experience.\nOur findings suggest that values related to “rights” and \nthe free market are the most salient shared frameworks or \nschemas on both sides of this religious freedom debate. The \nframework of rights is widespread in American public dis-\ncourse, and the belief in the importance of rights is univer-\nsally shared (Djupe et al., 2015). As people draw on rights \nlanguage, they make claims about how they and others \ndeserve to be treated in the public sphere (Harrington and \nYngvesson 1990; Jenness 1999; Minow 1987). Americans \nassert the importance of both individual and group rights that \nemerge from the Constitution yet can see these rights in ten-\nsion with one another (Bumiller 1992; Scheingold 2004). \nThe shared framework or cultural schema of “rights” is so \nsalient in America that an appeal to “rights” is envisioned as \nan appeal to a better society (Scheingold 2004). For instance, \nKazyak et al. 3\nthe civil rights movement advocated that all Americans, \nincluding people of color, have the right to be free from dis-\ncrimination, a framework that activists have worked to \nextend to other groups, including gay and lesbians (Bernstein \n2003; Skrentny 2002). Yet the use of “rights” is undertaken \nby both political liberals and conservatives to bolster posi-\ntions on a range of issues, including school choice, gun con-\ntrol, and abortion (Garnett and Garnett 2000; Jelen 2005; \nLuker 1985). Indeed, conservatives opposed to the expan-\nsion of LGBTQ rights have argued that these are “special \nrights” gays and lesbians do not deserve (Goldberg-Hiller \nand Milner 2003; Stein 2001; Stone 2016).\nAdditionally, scholars note that neoliberal understandings \nincreasingly infuse how Americans make sense of social life, \nincluding the views that the “free market” is paramount, and \ngovernment intervention should be limited (Amable 2011; \nBrown 2006; Harvey 2005). Neoliberalism is, in the words \nof Lisa Duggan (2004:10), “a kind of ‘nonpolitics’”: an ide-\nology that promotes what are assumed to be universal values \nrelated to the spread of capitalism and the increase of wealth \nacross the globe. When applied to cultural issues, neoliberal \nvalues minimize public demand for protective government \npolicies and instead privatize the role of social welfare, plac-\ning the burden on individuals and families (see also Levitsky \n2014). Before turning to our analyses of how the cultural \nschemas of “rights” and “free market” emerge as people \nmake sense of business owners’ serving gay and lesbian cus-\ntomers, we briefly outline the history of religious freedom \nlegislation and the current context of religious freedom leg-\nislation related to LGBTQ rights.\nLegislating Religious Freedom\nSince Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct (RFRA) in 1993, 25 states have enacted similar religious \nfreedom laws. Debates over many of the earliest religious \nfreedom laws included no mention of same-sex wedding \ncakes. The RFRA was initially passed to overturn a Supreme \nCourt ruling (Employment Division v. Smith 1990) that deter-\nmined that Native American employees did not have the con-\nstitutional right to smoke peyote as part of a religious \nceremony. The organizations originally supporting the pas-\nsage of the RFRA included the American Civil Liberties \nUnion and moderate religious groups such as the American \nJewish Committee and the United Methodist Church \n(Hamilton 2015). Many of the initial supporters of the RFRA \nlikely did not anticipate its effects. These include, according \nto legal scholar Margaret Hamilton (2015:140), that religious \npersons have “a significantly higher likelihood of success” \nwhen claiming religious grounds for actions that may violate \nthe law.\nThe conflict over religious freedom and civil rights in the \nworkplace is not unique to LGBT politics. The federal Civil \nRights Act requires that employers accommodate religious \nexemption requests as long as these requests do not cause \n“undue hardship” on employers. Definitions of “religious \nfreedom,” however, remain murky because “undue hard-\nship” is a subjective measure. Recent court cases have \nincluded a Muslim flight attendant who wishes to be exempt \nfrom serving alcohol; postal workers who refused to process \ndraft registration forms on the grounds of religious pacifism; \nand Christian nurses who refuse to wash instruments to pre-\npare for abortion procedures (Volokh 2015). Historically, \nreligious groups attempted and failed to be exempt from laws \nthat prohibit racial discrimination (Minow 2007; Turley \n2008). Bob Jones University, for example, lost its tax-exempt \nstatus when it continued to prohibit interracial marriages \nafter Loving v. Virginia rejected this prohibition in 1967. \nReligious groups have received some exemptions when it \ncomes to laws protecting gender discrimination. For exam-\nple, if an unmarried female employee signs a declaration of \nfaith with a religious employer, she can be legally terminated \nfrom employment if she becomes pregnant (Minow 2007).\nReligious freedom laws offer a strategy in the current \nmoment for religious conservative political actors concerned \nthat the advancement of LGBTQ rights infringes on the rights \nof religious conservatives (Corvino, Anderson, and Girgis \n2017). Even though the U.S. Constitution explicitly protects \nthe freedom of religious expression, and most states do not \noffer protection for LGBTQ rights (such as from housing or \nemployment discrimination), the RFRA and related state bills \nprovide a practical route by which individuals can use the \ncourts to make free exercise violation claims against the state \n(Bridge 2014; Richardson 2015).3 One such law is Mississippi \nHouse Bill 1523 (passed in April 2016 and implemented in \nOctober 2017 after a series of court appeals), which protects \npersons who have “the sincerely held religious belief” that \nmarriage “should be recognized as the union of one man and \none woman” to decide whether to provide services, including \nhousing and employment, to LGBTQ people. The law does \nnot protect religious freedom generally but specifically draws \nfrom conservative Protestant beliefs to put forth specific reg-\nulations surrounding gender and sexuality. It defines, for \nexample, “a man” and “a woman,” according to law: “an indi-\nvidual’s immutable biological sex as objectively determined \nby anatomy and genetics at the time of birth.” Although the \nRFRA as it was first enacted garnered a wide range of support \nfrom liberal and conservative organizations alike, recent reli-\ngious freedom legislation is explicitly a compendium to an \nanti-LGBTQ and antiabortion political agenda connected to \nthe religious right (Hamilton 2015).\nIt has yet to be determined whether these refusals of ser-\nvices would be upheld in court, even if they may be pro-\ntected by state law. State legislatures along with courts must \ndetermine whether LGBT nondiscrimination laws must \n3As of June 2017, there are 28 states with no employment or hous-\ning nondiscrimination laws covering sexual orientation or gender \nidentity (Movement Advancement Project 2017).\n4 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \noffer religious exemptions and what those exemptions might \nbe. Legal scholars on both sides agree that any outcome sig-\nnals the state’s moral position about gay and lesbian citizen-\nship (Dent 2006; Feldblum 2008; Minow 2007). \nNondiscrimination laws signal that to not protect gays and \nlesbians is morally wrong. Religious exemptions to these \nlaws, however, signal that the exclusion of gays and lesbians \nis morally permissible. As Feldblum (2008) describes, “an \ninevitable choice between liberties must come into play” \n(p. 153). Although legal scholars have proposed various \nsolutions to this dilemma (see Dent 2006; Feldblum 2008; \nTurley 2008; Wilson 2017) popular debates highlight only \nthis either/or position: protection of gays and lesbians at the \nexpense of religious conservatives or the protection of reli-\ngious conservatives at the expense of gays and lesbians.\nLGBTQ Rights in a Postmarriage \nContext\nAnalyzing public opinion about legal protection for business \nowners who refuse service to gay men and lesbians is also \ninstructive of how Americans make sense of LGBTQ rights. \nPolling agencies and researchers have tracked Americans’ atti-\ntudes of laws and policies affecting LGBTQ individuals and \nhave shown large shifts in public opinion during the previous \ndecades. Across public opinion polls today, more Americans \nsupport same-sex marriage than oppose it (McCarthy 2014, \n2016, 2017; Pew Research Center 2014; Silver 2013). \nResearchers have also found high levels of support for laws \nprotecting LGBTQ people from housing and job discrimina-\ntion (Lax and Phillips 2009; Lewis and Rogers 1999; Powell \net al. 2010). Consistently, research shows that women, higher \neducated people, nonreligious individuals, younger genera-\ntions, and political liberals are more likely to support these \npro-LGBTQ policies than men, lower educated people, reli-\ngious individuals, older generations, and political conserva-\ntives (Brumbaugh et al. 2008; Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2005; \nLewis 2011; Lewis and Gossett 2008; Olson, Cadge, and \nHarrison 2006; Pearl and Galupo 2007; Rowatt et al. 2009; \nSherkat, de Vries, and Creek 2010; Swank, Woodford, and \nLim 2013; Whitehead 2010; Woodford et al. 2012).\nRecent polls have found that Americans are divided over \nthe issues legislated by recent religious freedom bills depend-\ning on how the question is asked (Pew Research Center \n2016d; Powell et al. 2017; Rasmussen 2015). Data from the \nPew Research Center (2016d) show that 52.32 percent of \nrespondents think that businesses providing wedding related \nservices, such as catering or flowers, should be allowed to \nrefuses services to same-sex couples. A similar number of \npeople (53 percent) surveyed in a national experimental sur-\nvey reported that a photographer should have the right to \ndeny a same-sex couple’s request for wedding photography \n(Powell et al. 2017). Yet a 2017 survey conducted by the \nPublic Religion Research Institute (PRRI; Cox and Jones \n2017) found that only 32 percent of Americans believe that \nsmall businesses should be able to refuse to provide services \nto gay and lesbian people on religious grounds. Another \nnational survey found that 65.5 percent of respondents sup-\nported “some religious freedom laws to protect individuals \nwith legitimate religious beliefs” but that 63 percent of those \nrespondents also agreed that “sometimes states do pass laws \ndesigned to discriminate” (Jackson State University 2016). \nOur work adds to the limited public opinion data on religious \nfreedom laws that reference sexual minorities and enriches \nour understanding about how people justify their support or \nopposition to these laws.\nNebraska: A Case Study\nAlthough we do not claim our data are nationally generaliz-\nable, characteristics of Nebraska make our data instructive \nfor how Americans make sense of debates over religious \nfreedom legislation. First, although Nebraska is more politi-\ncally conservative than the national average, the state is com-\nparable with the rest of the nation when it comes to attitudes \nabout LGBTQ rights. Nebraska voters overwhelmingly sup-\nported a ban on same-sex marriage in a 2000 referendum \n(Adam 2003; Rasmussen 2006), and the Republican Party, \nwhich largely controls the state government, continues to \nadvocate for defining marriage as the union between one \nman and one woman. Yet in the decade that followed the ban \non same-sex marriage, the flagship state university and some \nschool districts, hospitals, business, and city and county gov-\nernments extended benefits to same-sex couples (Dejka \n2013; Funk 2013; Glissmann 2013; Reed 2012). Moreover, \nrecent analyses indicate that the majority of Nebraskans sup-\nport same-sex marriage and other LGBTQ rights and that \nNebraskans’ opinions mirror national public opinion on these \nissues (Stange and Kazyak 2016).\nAdditionally, Nebraska is fairly average when it comes to \nmeasures of religiosity. A Pew Research Center (2014) study \nranks it the 22nd most religious state, on the basis of the per-\ncentage of residents who say that religion is very important in \ntheir lives (54 percent), that they attend worship services \nweekly (39 percent), that they pray daily (52 percent), and \nthat they believe in God with certainty (69 percent). It is nei-\nther highly religious like states in the South (Mississippi and \nAlabama are tied for the most religious) nor highly secular \nlike states in the Northeast (New Hampshire and Massachusetts \nare tied for least religious). Moreover, religious affiliations in \nthe state are comparable with those in the rest of the nation. \nSeventy-five percent of Nebraska residents identify as \nChristian, compared with 71 percent of Americans overall. \nWhite evangelical Protestants, who often lead efforts to pass \nreligious liberty legislation and who are more likely to sup-\nport it than other religious groups, make up about 25 percent \nof the population in Nebraska and the country.\nFinally, Nebraska lawmakers have not introduced reli-\ngious freedom legislation. This means that survey respon-\ndents answered questions about a hypothetical scenario or \nKazyak et al. 5\none they may have observed on the news from other states \nrather than events affecting their neighbors or fellow citi-\nzens. This allows us to understand how narratives about reli-\ngious freedom that draw from ideas about freedom and \ndemocracy operate ideologically (Bonikowski and DiMaggio \n2016; Thomas and Whitehead 2015). As Laurel Westbrook \nand Kristen Schilt (2014) argued, especially when it comes \nto cotemporary debates over LGBTQ rights, definitions of \nsex, gender, and sexuality operate at an imaginary level, \nwhereby individuals draw from suppositional ideas and \nhypothetical scenes, rather than specific evidence or experi-\nence. The data we analyze include open-ended survey data, \nwhich allow us to examine the underlying logic people have \nregarding their views on religious freedom laws.\nMethods\nData\nOur data come from the 2015 Nebraska Annual Social \nIndicators Survey (NASIS). NASIS is an annual, cross-sec-\ntional, omnibus survey of Nebraska adults ages 19 and older, \nwhich is conducted by the Bureau of Sociological Research \nat the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. The 2015 NASIS \nwas a mail survey sent to randomly selected address-based \nsample of 3,500 Nebraska households that was provided by \nSurvey Sampling International. Respondents were selected \nwithin sampled households using the next-birthday tech-\nnique. Data collection consisted of three mailings (initial sur-\nvey packet with a $1 cash incentive, postcard reminder, and \na replacement survey packet) sent between August 12, 2015, \nand October 20, 2015 (NASIS 2014–2015 Methodology \nReport). A total of 1,143 respondents completed NASIS \n2015, for a response rate of 32.7 percent (American \nAssociation for Public Opinion Research Response Rate 1; \nAmerican Association for Public Opinion Research 2009).\nNASIS data have the advantage of not only quantitatively \nmeasuring people’s views on religious freedom laws but also \nincluding data on how people justify their views. Because \nour aim is to examine how people justify their view through \nopen-ended responses, we do not weight the NASIS data to \ngeneralize to Nebraska’s adult population. Rather, we gener-\nalize findings to the sample of NASIS respondents. Table 1 \ndisplays the demographic, political, and religious makeup of \nthe completed NASIS 2015 sample and displays the \nunweighted respondent characteristics from Pew’s national \nsample, which we use as a national comparison (Pew \nResearch Center 2016d). The distributions show that NASIS \nrespondents were more likely to be female, religious, and \nRepublican but also less racially and ethnically diverse.\nMeasures\nWe focus our analyses on the NASIS 2015 questions asking \nabout respondents’ views of religious freedom laws (see \nTable 1.

The par-\nent codes included: “rights” (references to a person’s or \ngroup’s “right,” either explicitly or implicitly), universal truth \n(declarations that draw from broad ideas about the nature of \nthe world or humankind), “free market” (references to capi-\ntalism or the economic system), and sexuality irrelevant \n(claims that sexuality or sexual orientation does not or should \nnot matter in business contexts). The parent codes represented \nhigher level ideas respondents drew on in contextualizing \ntheir views of religious freedom laws. The child codes further \ncharacterize the ideas within each parent code. The child and \ngrandchild codes offer more nuance in how respondents used \nthe logic (i.e., parent code) in their responses. For instance, \nfor the “rights” parent code, the child codes identify whether \nthe respondent used the logic of “rights” related to business \nowners or customers. We then noted whether the respondents \nwho used business owner’s rights focused their responses \nspecifically on a business owner’s religious beliefs or rights \nnonspecific to religion. Similarly, we noted whether respon-\ndents who used customer’s rights made explicit reference to \ngay or lesbian persons or to customers generally.\nIn the following section, we first report the frequency of \neach parent code in the data.4 “Quantitizing” the qualitative \nTable 2.

(continued)\nTable 2). The first question asked respondents whether they \nfavor or oppose laws that allow business owners to deny ser-\nvices to gay men or lesbians on the basis of the owners’ reli-\ngious beliefs. The second is an open-ended question, which \nimmediately followed the first question, asking respondents \nwhy they favored or opposed such laws. A total of 1,117 \nrespondents (97.73 percent) answered the closed-ended, \nfavor/oppose question, and 838 respondents (73.32 percent \nof all respondents and 75.02 percent of those who answered \nthe closed-ended question) elaborated on their opinion by \nwriting responses to the open-ended question. Responses \nwere typically brief (one to two sentences) but capture the \nshared frameworks or cultural schemas that are available to \npeople as they make sense of religious freedom debates \n(Blair-Loy 2001).\nAnalysis\nWe used an explanatory mixed-methods approach (Creswell \nand Plano Clark 2011) to examine and explore respondents’ \nviews of religious freedom laws. First, we analyzed the per-\ncentages of NASIS respondents who favored and opposed \nreligious freedom laws. Using χ2 tests, we examined how \nNASIS respondents’ views differ by demographic, political, \nand religious characteristics, and we compared these find-\nings with how opinion of religious freedom laws varies by \nthese characteristics among national data from the Pew \nResearch Center (2014).\nOur next set of analyses centered on the qualitative data. \nQualitative analysis allows us to move beyond the quantitative \noutcomes of “favor versus oppose” to hear from respondents \nabout how they contextualize their views on a complex issue \nimplicated by religious freedom laws. Qualitative coding of \nthe open-ended responses was iterative. First, all three authors \nread the open-ended responses, and each author generated an \ninitial list of codes that emerged from the data (Crabtree and \nMiller 1992). Second, we cross-checked provisional codes \n4Some quotations did not fit into the coding scheme reported in this \narticle. The themes in these quotations either occurred at such low \nfrequencies that they did not warrant their own codes or showed \nthat the respondents did not understand the topic of the question. \nFor example, some respondents appeared to interpret the question \nas asking about the ability to hire or fire an employee on the basis \nKazyak et al. 7\ndata shows how often each code appeared in the data \n(Driscoll et al. 2007; Tashakkori and Teddlie 1998). We used \nχ2 tests to examine which types of respondents (demographic, \npolitical, and religious characteristics) used which logic to \ncontextualize their views on religious freedom laws. Finally, \nwe explored how respondents used logics to justify both \nfavoring and opposing religious freedom laws. Because we \nare most interested in how the same cultural schemas can be \nused to reach different conclusion, in this analysis we focus \non the only two parent codes that were used nearly evenly by \nrespondents on both sides of the issue: rights and free mar-\nket. We used direct quotes from respondents to illustrate how \nrespondents articulated their views.\nLimitations\nNASIS data are not generalizable to the U.S. population; we \ncannot assume that our data resemble national opinion, \nthough some evidence suggests that our results may be com-\nparable. For example, 32 percent of respondents in a 2017 \nPRRI national survey reported that “small businesses should \nbe able to refuse to provide services to gay and lesbian people \non religious grounds,” compared with 36 percent of NASIS \nrespondents, and 56 percent of white evangelicals held this \nview in the PRRI survey compared with 52 percent of white \nevangelical NASIS respondents (Cox and Jones 2017).5 \nAnother limitation of our data is that the survey asks only a \nsingle question related to religious freedom legislation. There \nare additional topics legislated in religious freedom bills that \nour data do not address, including transgender people using \npublic restrooms, employers being required to provide birth \ncontrol, same-sex couples accessing fertility treatments, or \nreligious leaders being required to recognize same-sex mar-\nriage (all topics legislated in religious freedom bills). Given \nthat bills proposed in states do not share common language, it \nis difficult for a single survey to capture public opinion on the \nissue of “religious freedom” as a whole. Yet because religious \nfreedom legislation has implications beyond wedding-related \nservices, surveys should attempt to capture the public’s opin-\nion on a range of issues. In a related vein, our survey was \nconducted very shortly after the Obergefell v. Hodges deci-\nsion. Future work should track whether the public’s attitudes \nchange as more legislation is introduced or passed and as \nmore cases are publicized.\nFindings\nViews on Religious Freedom Laws\nAmong the NASIS respondents, 36.31 percent favored \nreligious freedom laws, and 63.69 percent opposed them.6 \nFigure 1. Coding structure for open-ended responses.\nof sexual orientation. Other respondents wrote explanations of their \nviews on same-sex marriage. We excluded these exceptions from \nthe analyses.\n5Question wording from the PRRI survey was the most comparable \nwith our survey, but a data embargo until 2018 prohibits us from \nrunning analyses to draw further comparisons with our data. For \nthis reason, we use national data from the Pew Research Center \n(2016d) for comparisons.\n6Our initial results indicated that 35.35 percent favored religious \nfreedom laws and that 64.55 percent opposed religious freedom \nlaws. Coding the open-ended responses, however, revealed 18 \nrespondents who we believe mismarked their responses to the \nclosed-ended item (e.g., respondents marking that they oppose reli-\ngious freedom laws but writing that they support laws that allow \nbusiness owners to deny services to gay men and lesbians). Thus, \nwe created a measure that corrected these inconsistent responses. \nBecause there was a less than 1 percentage point difference between \nthe original and corrected measure, we use the corrected measure \nfor the remaining analyses. The distributions were also similar \nto weighted analyses, which showed 63.67 percent opposing and \n36.33 percent favoring religious freedom laws among the original \nvariable and 62.97 percent opposing and 37.03 percent favoring \nreligious freedom laws among the corrected variable.\n8 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nIn comparison, national data from the Pew Research Center \n(2016d) show that 52.32 percent of the Pew survey respon-\ndents think that businesses providing wedding-related ser-\nvices, such as catering or flowers, should be allowed to refuse \nservices to same-sex couples, whereas 47.68 percent reported \nthat businesses should be required to provide wedding-related \nservices. Similarly, analyses from a national experimental \nsurvey reveal that 53 percent of Americans believe that a pho-\ntographer should be able to refuse services to a same-sex \ncouple (Powell et al. 2017). We anticipated that results from \nsurveys that asked specifically about “wedding-related ser-\nvices” would be more closely divided than NASIS data \nbecause those questions emphasizes the contested topic of \nmarriage. The NASIS data show that when asking about busi-\nnesses generally, the result is fewer people favoring religious \nfreedom laws (see also Cox and Jones 2017).\nChi-square analyses, nonetheless, show similar signifi-\ncant differences in views of religious freedom laws by demo-\ngraphic, political, and religious characteristics for both \nNASIS and Pew data (Table 3). Both data sets show signifi-\ncant differences in views of religious freedom laws by gen-\nder, political party, political ideology, religious affiliation, \nborn-again Christian identity, and religious attendance. \nThese characteristics are all associated with views of reli-\ngious freedom laws in similar ways as other LGB policies \n(Brumbaugh et al. 2008; Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2005; \nLewis 2011; Lewis and Gossett 2008; Olson et al. 2006; \nPearl and Galupo 2007; Rowatt et al. 2009; Sherkat et al. \n2010; Swank et al. 2013; Whitehead 2010; Woodford et al. \n2012). For example, 46.35 percent men favor religious free-\ndom laws compared with 29.76 percent of women in NASIS, \nχ2(1) = 30.9474, p < .001), and 57.04 percent of men and \n47.26 percent of women favor religious freedom laws in the \nPew data, χ2(1) = 17.9394, p < .001). Furthermore, Democrats, \nliberals, and nonreligious respondents are more likely to \noppose religious freedom laws. Interestingly, unlike in anal-\nyses of views of other LGB issues, such as same-sex mar-\nriage, views of religious freedom laws did not significantly \ndiffer by respondent education level in the NASIS data, χ2(5) \n= 4.2979, p = .507, or Pew data, χ2(7) = 7.0072, p = .428.\nIn addition, NASIS included respondent characteristics \nnot measured in the Pew survey, including respondent sex-\nual orientation and whether the respondent knows an LGB \nperson. Unsurprisingly, LGB respondents almost unani-\nmously opposed religious freedom laws, χ2(4) = 13.5394, p \n= .009, and respondents who know an LGB person were \nsignificantly more likely to oppose religious freedom laws \nthan those who do not know an LGB person, χ2(1) = \n21.2502, p < .001).\nLogics Used for Views\nTable 4 displays the frequency and percentage that each \nqualitative code characterized the logic used in responses to \nthe question asking respondents why they hold their views \non religious freedom laws and the breakdown in support for \nreligious freedom laws by each type of logic. (See Figure 1 \nfor an illustration of the full coding hierarchy.) Note that the \ncodes are not mutually exclusive; some responses were char-\nacterized by more than one type of logic, such as making \nboth a rights and a sexuality-irrelevant argument. A little \nover half of responses (59 percent) included a rights-based \nargument, with the next most frequent logic used being uni-\nversal truth, at 26 percent of the responses. Free market and \nsexuality irrelevant responses were the least frequent, at 9 \npercent and 11 percent, respectively.\nAs seen in Table 4, support for religious freedom laws \nwas highest among respondents who used “free market” \nlogic in their responses, with 57 percent of those respondents \nfavoring the laws. This is followed closely by the “rights” \nlogic code, with 54 percent of those respondents favoring the \nlaws. Support for religious freedom laws was lowest among \nthose respondents using “sexuality irrelevant” logic (7 per-\ncent) and for those using “universal truth” logic (16 percent). \nBelow we present qualitative analysis on the “free market” \nand “rights” codes because these were the logics shared by \nrespondents with opposing views.\nAs reported in Table 5, χ2 analyses showed few consis-\ntent demographic, political, and religious trends in what \ntypes of respondents used the various logics. The respon-\ndents who justified their views on religious freedom laws \nby drawing on rights-based logic were more likely to know \nan LGB person, have higher education levels, and more \nlikely to identify as a Republican and as politically conser-\nvative. Whether the response drew on rights logic versus \nanother type of logic did not significantly differ by other \nrespondent demographic and religious characteristics. The \nonly demographic characteristic that significantly differed \nfor the free market code was that the respondents employ-\ning that logic were significantly more likely to report know-\ning an LGB person.\nDifferent Sides, Same Logic: Rights and the Free \nMarket\nBoth sides rely on two logics that are foundational to the \nAmerican experience: the protection of rights and the capi-\ntalist economy. People who favor the rights of business \nowners to deny services to gay men and lesbians relied \nalmost exclusively on these two logics. Although responses \nfrom those who oppose the rights of business owners to \ndeny services to gay men and lesbians were more varied, \nthese responses also relied heavily on “rights” and the “free \nmarket” to justify their position. That both sides used the \ncultural schemas of rights and free market, but reached dif-\nferent conclusions, points to disagreements not over the \nvalue of freedom or equality per se but rather over the ques-\ntions of whose rights are most worthy of protection and \nwhose freedom is potentially jeopardized in the current \nmoment.\nKazyak et al. 9\nTable 3.

Respondents who used a “rights” logic shared the \nidea that Americans have a fundamental right to live their \nlives freely. For those who opposed religious freedom laws, \nthis meant a focus on an individual’s right to be free from \ndiscrimination. For those who support religious freedom \nlaws, this meant a focus on an individual’s right to be free \nfrom government control and freedom to act in ways that \nuphold their religious convictions.\nSome respondents who used a “rights” logic interpreted a \nlaw that would allow a business owner to deny services to \ngay men or lesbians on the basis of their religious belief to be \ncodifying discrimination against people on the basis of sex-\nual orientation. Their responses foregrounded issues of fair-\nness and equality. As one person commented, “It is a civil \nright for all Americans to be treated fairly.” Another noted, \n“Government supported discrimination on any basis is \nwrong.” This sentiment echoed what others said, including: \n“I am against all forms of discrimination”; “Business owners \ncannot refuse service to a specific group”; “I oppose laws \nbecause it can be used as an excuse to discriminate”; and \n“Everyone should have same access to services despite the \nservice provider’s personal beliefs. Otherwise, it would be \nblatant discrimination.” Religious freedom bills are discrimi-\nnatory against gay men and lesbians, according to these \nrespondents, and antithetical to their belief that gays and les-\nbians have the right to be treated equally and to not face \ndiscrimination.\nMany people drew a parallel to discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation with forms of discrimination that \nAmericans widely oppose (Pew Research Center 2016b). \nThe following comment is exemplary of respondents who \nmade reference to racial discrimination: “It is discrimina-\ntory! We may as well allow people to refuse service to people \nof other races.” Similarly, another person explained that they \nopposed laws that would allow business owners to deny ser-\nvices “because businesses discriminating against LGBT peo-\nple is no different than half a century ago when businesses \ndiscriminated against blacks. Supporting civil rights means \neveryone gets to sit at the lunch counter.” Some also made \nthe comparison with discrimination on the basis of religion. \nTable 4.

Here respondents \nemphasized a general freedom belonging to business owners \n(as opposed to a specific right belonging to business owners \nas we outline below). This freedom to make decisions about \nwhom to serve was not necessarily tied to the business own-\ner’s religious beliefs, but connected to the general rights of \nowning and operating a business. According to one com-\nment: “Whether you agree or disagree with a business own-\ner’s policies, if they own it, they can do what they want. \nDoesn’t mean its right/wrong.” Another respondent \nresponded more aggressively: “I’m tired of this being shoved \ndown our throat. A business should have the right to serve or \nnot [serve] anyone they want to.” Several respondents refer-\nenced a sign common to storefronts, “No shoes, no shirt- no \nservice!” One respondent added, “Business owners have \nbeen doing this for years.” As these comments illustrate, \npeople using this logic interpreted the potential for business \nowners to refuse service to a gay or lesbian person as an \nextension of other forms of decisions that business owners \ncould make in terms of providing service, such as denying \nservice to someone not wearing a shirt or shoes. Respondents \nprivileged business owners’ ability to make decisions inde-\npendent from what they viewed as governmental interfer-\nence; as one person remarked, “I think government should \nstay out of it.” This logic was akin to the discrimination jus-\ntification outlined earlier in that it was a blanket sort of logic: \npeople should be free from all forms of discrimination in the \nsame way that business owners should be free from regula-\ntion of any kind.\nMany respondents emphasized not only that business \nowners should have the right to refuse service for any reason \nbut also specifically that business owners should have the \nright to make decisions that support their religious beliefs. \nHere respondents emphasized the First Amendment and the \nprotection of religious freedom for all Americans. Some \nillustrative comments include “1st Amendment of US \nConstitution: Right to free exercise of religion (not just \nthought)” and “protection of the First Amendment” and \n“Owners should not be forced to go against their religious \nbeliefs that should be guaranteed under the Constitution.” As \nthese quotations illustrate, some respondents characterized \nreligious freedom laws as necessary reiterations of the exist-\ning constitutional right of business owners. For instance, one \nrespondent commented, “the constitution states that we, as \nUS citizens have freedom of religion. If we must provide \nservices to gays or face legal penalties, this is denying us the \nfreedom to practice our faith.” According to respondents \nsuch as this one, religious freedom laws are necessary in the \nwake of marriage equality and expanding LGBT rights \nbecause some business owners have religious objections to \nhomosexuality and same-sex marriage.\nOther respondents did not invoke the Constitution or First \nAmendment explicitly but nonetheless pointed to business \nowners’ right to practice their religious beliefs. For instance, \nrespondents wrote comments such as “no private business \nowner should be compelled to do things against their religion”; \n“Because of the persons [sic] religious beliefs should take prec-\nedent [sic]”; “As a business owner you should not have to do \nsomething against your religious beliefs!!!”; “I believe this \ncountry was founded because our fore fathers believed in the \nright to practice our religion without persecution by the govern-\nment”; and “owner of business should be able to conduct busi-\nness in accordance with his religious convictions—to be true to \nhimself. He owns the business!” These comments further \nunderscore that support of religious freedom laws centers on \ntheir belief that without such laws, business owners’ rights to \npractice their religion are infringed upon.\nBoth sides create parallels between social identity catego-\nries (e.g., being gay and being black, being Christian and \nbeing gay) to justify their positions on the basis of the over-\narching theme of individual freedom. As one respondent who \nopposes religious freedom laws wrote, “I oppose because I \ndon’t want someone’s religious beliefs to determine how I or \nmy family live our lives. Why are their beliefs more impor-\ntant than mine?” This statement is remarkably similar to one \nwritten by a respondent who supports religious freedom laws: \n“No one (either side) should be forced to do something they \ndon’t believe in, that makes them very uncomfortable.” This \ncall to the rights of “either side” emphasizes the shared cul-\ntural schema among those with different perspectives on reli-\ngious freedom laws. Despite using similar schema, \nrespondents nonetheless reach different conclusions about \nthese laws, an implication that we return to in the discussion.\nThe Free Market. Our data find a “free market” logic to be \nless common than the “rights” logic to support or oppose \nreligious freedom laws. For those who use a “free market” \nlogic, 56 percent favored a business owner’s right to refuse \nservice to gay men and lesbians (see Table 4). A significant \nportion of “free market” responses, however, used this logic \nto oppose religious freedom laws. The “free market” code \ncaptures any reference to the capitalist economy, particularly \nthe motivation and risk of generating profit that accompanies \nrunning a business. For those who support religious freedom \nlaws, this generally meant respondents who justified their \nposition by arguing that gay and lesbian customers in the free \nmarket economy can choose an alternative business if one \nbusiness owner refuses to serve them. For those who oppose \nKazyak et al. 13\nreligious freedom laws using this logic, they emphasized that \nbusiness owners should not let morals or values get in the \nway of the primary purpose of business: generating a profit.\nRespondents who favored religious freedom laws using a \n“free market” logic painted a picture of an economy full of \nchoices for customers. Their responses suggested that there \nare many businesses willing to serve gay men and lesbians \nand that gay men and lesbians should frequent those busi-\nnesses. One illustrative example comes from a respondent \nwho writes, “the issue is not denial of service, it is exercise \nof conscience. The ‘services’ are readily available else-\nwhere.” This respondent makes explicit what was implicit in \nmost other responses using a similar logic: that the abun-\ndance of American businesses means that gay men and lesbi-\nans are not harmed if they are not able to receive services \nfrom one or a few that refuse to serve them. As other \nresponses indicate, “They [gay men and lesbians] have \nplenty of other option[s]”; “There are plenty of gay-friendly \nbusinesses”; and “Business owners should be able to run \ntheir businesses as they want and not be controlled by the \ngovernment. If gays don’t like it they can buy their things \nother place[s].” Sentiments like these are somewhat surpris-\ning coming from our sample, as Nebraska has a significant \nrural population where choice in businesses tends to be lim-\nited. Yet these responses mirror a neoliberal logic, imagining \nthe economy as diverse, vast, and accessible to all Americans \n(Amable 2011). In tandem with a “rights” logic supporting \nbusiness owners who deny services to gay men and lesbians, \nrespondents using a “free market” logic implied that reli-\ngious freedom laws do not actually harm gay men and lesbi-\nans. Instead, the “harm” at stake in religious freedom debates \nis over the protection of religious people who operate their \nbusinesses in a free market.\nRespondents who oppose religious freedom laws using a \n“free market” logic suggest that the American economy is, \nby its nature, objective and nondiscriminatory, and to get in \nthe way of this “free market” process (understood here as not \ndoing business with gay men and lesbians) is to get in the \nway of capitalist American values. One respondent calls it a \n“bad business decision” for a business owner to refuse ser-\nvice and potential profit from certain “law abiding citizens” \nand goes on to state, “I think the government should stay out \nof it. It’s called natural consequences.” Although many \nrespondents emphasized negative outcomes for actual busi-\nnesses (as we describe below), other comments focused \nmore broadly on the ideology of the free market. These \nrespondents wrote comments such as “Commerce is a privi-\nlege to serve the public. All the public” and “there should be \na distinct separation between religion and commerce. If there \nis demand, it would kill a capitalist society.” For respondents \nwho oppose religious freedom laws, the “free market” under-\nscores the democracy and equality that is foundational to \nAmerica, including its economy.\nMany respondents using this logic emphasized that cus-\ntomer identity is less important than the money they spend \nand that business owners should be concerned only with the \nlatter. As one respondent put it, “money all spends the same.” \nOther comments echo this belief that business owners should \nnot refuse service of to anyone: “the idea of business is to \nmake money. To refuse a money making transaction is stu-\npid” and “as a business owner, you don’t turn away busi-\nness.” Some respondents pointed to the negative \nconsequences of withholding services to a certain popula-\ntion, like one respondent who believed it would have a nega-\ntive effect on the businesses themselves: “I think those biz \n[businesses] owner’s will fail with that way of thinking and \ndoing biz [business].” Responses like these combined a logic \nof “rights” (freedom from discrimination) and the “free mar-\nket” to oppose the protection of business owners who choose \nto refuse services to gay men and lesbians.\nIn sum, the logic of “free market” was used by both \nrespondents who supported and opposed religious freedom \nlaw. However, their comments underscore diverging view-\npoints with regard to whose actions and decisions within the \ncapitalist economy are salient. For respondents who favor the \nlaws, the focus is on the decision of gay and lesbian custom-\ners (i.e., they can go elsewhere). In contrast, those who oppose \nthe laws focus on the decision of the business owner (i.e., they \nare making a bad business decision). What these positions \nhave in common, though, is a clear product of neoliberal ide-\nology: that social conflicts and divisions can (and should) be \nadjudicated by the free market. On both sides of the debate, \nthis logic uses the guise of economic forces to obscure other \nsolutions to persistent inequalities (Duggan 2004).\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nReligious freedom laws may be the current “battleground” \nover LGBTQ rights, and some argue that their passage in 25 \nstates (as of June 2017) represents a backlash to increased \nacceptance of LGBTQ people (Corvino et al. 2017). Yet our \nfindings suggest that the introduction and passage of these \nlaws may not reflect broad support. Using Nebraska as a case \nstudy, we find that a clear majority (64 percent) opposes laws \nthat allow business owners to deny services to gay men or \nlesbians on the basis of the owners’ religious beliefs. The fact \nthat support for religious freedom laws is at only 36 percent \nin Nebraska is particularly interesting given that Nebraska is \nseen as a red state, and more of its citizens identify as \nRepublicans compared to national averages (Saad 2013). \nDespite its leaning more conservative in terms of political \nideology, Nebraska is comparable with the national average \nin terms of both public opinion on LGBTQ rights and religi-\nosity (Pew Research Center 2014; Stange and Kazyak 2016). \nThus, treating Nebraskans’ public opinion as a case study is \ninstructive in terms of public opinion about religious free-\ndom laws.\nOur work highlights the overlap in the logics used and the \nsaliency of the cultural schemas of rights, discrimination, \nfreedom, and capitalism as people make sense of religious \n14 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nfreedom laws that directly reference sexual minorities. \nDespite using similar frameworks of rights, respondents who \nused this language reached very different conclusions about \nwhose rights (and which rights) should be protected and who \nfaces potential harm. Specifically, respondents who oppose \nreligious freedom laws view gay men and lesbians as a group \nfacing potential mistreatment and therefore as a group in \nneed of protection. According to their logic, gay and lesbian \nindividuals are like other marginalized groups, including \nAfrican Americans, whose civil rights either have been or \nhave the potential to be infringed upon because of social \nprejudices. Respondents view religious freedom legislation \nas threatening the freedom of gay men and lesbians to fully \nparticipate in public life. In contrast, people who favor reli-\ngious freedom laws view business owners as potentially \nharmed if they are unable to exercise their religion in making \nbusiness decisions. These respondents view the right to prac-\ntice one’s religion as paramount and, for conservative \nChristians, under threat in light of the advancement of \nLGBTQ rights, particularly same-sex marriage. Thus, they \nsee religious freedom bills as necessary to protect the rights \nof Christian business owners.\nWhen both sides rely on American values related to free-\ndom while describing different groups whose rights or inter-\nests are in jeopardy, it may appear as if the two opposing \nsides share equal footing within American life and law. This \nis bolstered by cultural schemas emphasizing equality and \nthe belief that no one should be discriminated against, in \naddition to the impersonal and objective capitalist free mar-\nket. Such schemas, however, obscure historic and persistent \ninequalities across groups (Brown 2006). Specifically, gays \nand lesbians have faced obstacles to being fully visible and \naccepted within American society in ways that Christians \nhave not (Canady 2009; Parker and Barreto 2013). Gays and \nlesbians, as well as non-Christians, face discrimination that \ndoes not affect their heterosexual or Christian counterparts \n(Mishel 2016; Schilt 2008). Researchers examining employ-\nment discrimination on religious grounds, for example, find \nthat Muslims, pagans, and atheists are more likely to face \ndiscrimination compared with other religious groups and \nnonreligious people (Wallace, Wright, and Hyde 2014; \nWright et al. 2013). Additionally, federal and state laws pro-\ntect people from discrimination on the basis of religion in all \n50 states, and in contrast, there is no federal protection for \npeople on the basis of sexual orientation, and only 20 states \noffer such protection (Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission 2018). Taken together these pieces of evidence \nillustrate the ways in which religion and sexuality are key \nboundary makers (Burke 2016; Edgell et al. 2016; Edgell \nand Tranby 2010; Emerson, Smith, and Sikkink 1999).\nNonetheless, some evangelical Christians perceive them-\nselves to be under threat in the current moment. According to \ndata from the Pew Research Center (2016c), 41 percent of this \ngroup reported that it is difficult to be an evangelical Christian \nin America. Likewise, a majority of white evangelicals (61 \npercent) believe that religious liberty is threatened in America \n(Cox and Jones 2012). Thus, the emphasis on rights and equal-\nity may be an intentional strategy of conservative religious \nactivists to emphasize perceived oppression and persecution \nof the conservative Christians within America in an era of \nincreasing visibility and acceptance of LGBTQ people. \nWhereas these activists had once used the framework of “spe-\ncial rights” to protest advancement of LGBTQ rights (i.e., that \ngays and lesbians were a minority group advocating for rights \nthat went above and beyond what the rest of Americans had), \nit may be that the new conceptualization of Christians as a \nreligious group under threat will hold more sway with some \nAmericans.\nInterestingly, respondents on both sides of this debate \nwho use a “free market” logic to justify their position focus \non the opposite group from their counterparts exclusively \nusing a “rights” logic. For proponents of religious freedom \nlaws, a free market rationale emphasizes that gay men and \nlesbians are not harmed as a result of religious freedom bills. \nAccording to them, even though gay men and lesbians may \nencounter a business owner who will not serve them, gays \nand lesbians are not harmed because the free market provides \nample business options for them to pursue. Yet on the other \nside, respondents draw on understandings about capitalism \nto posit that business owners would be harmed by religious \nfreedom bills because denying service to a group of potential \ncustomers would in fact be detrimental to business profits \nand contrary to the philosophy of the free market.\nFurthermore, that both those who support and oppose reli-\ngious freedom legislation draw on the cultural schema of \n“free market” indicates the degree to which neoliberalism has \ninfused how Americans make sense of social issues and may \nbe a side effect of an increasingly corporate-sponsored gay \nrights movements (Duggan 2004; Ghaziani 2008; Ward \n2008). The free market and capitalism are seen as arbiters of \njustice, ensuring both that business owners who would dis-\ncriminate against gays and lesbians would suffer appropriate \nconsequences (according to those who oppose legislation) \nand that gays and lesbians would have ample outlets to secure \nwhatever provisions they were seeking (according to those \nwho support legislation). Supporters of religious freedom \nlaws who focus on business owners’ rights showcases the \nvalue they place on business and capitalism. This may explain \nwhy researchers recently found that 53 percent of Americans \nsupport a business owner denying services to a gay couple, \nregardless of whether the reason for denying service was \nbecause of the business owner’s religious beliefs (Powell \net al. 2017). Indeed, we also found that not all people who \nsupport religious freedom legislation specifically mentioned \nthe need to protect religious freedom in their justification. \nMoreover, that those who oppose religious freedom legisla-\ntion likewise upheld neoliberalism and championed the \nframework of the free market mirrors the strategy used by \nsome LGBTQ rights organizations. For instance, groups such \nas the Human Rights Campaign put out an equality index that \nKazyak et al. 15\nranks businesses and corporations on how LGBTQ friendly \nthey are using a range of measures. Our findings support the \nobservation that Americans may increasingly look to nongov-\nernmental interventions, such as the free market, to adjudicate \nmatters of discrimination and equality with regard to religious \nfreedom (see Duggan 2004; Levitsky 2014).\nUltimately, the fact that people on both sides of the \ndebates over religious freedom laws appeal to frameworks \nthat resonate with nearly all Americans to justify their posi-\ntion underscores why these bills will likely continue to be \nintroduced, debated, and seen as controversial, despite the \nfact that polling data suggests that a majority of Americans \nmay actually be opposed to some of what such bills codify \ninto law.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Emma Finken Ruby Hoffman and Rosalind \nKichler for their research assistance.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support \nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This \nwork was supported by the University of Nebraska–Lincoln College \nof Arts and Sciences and Department of Sociology.\nReferences\nAdam, Barry D. 2003. “The Defense of Marriage Act and American \nExceptionalism: The ‘Gay Marriage’ Panic in the United \nStates.” Journal of the History of Sexuality 12(2):259–76.\nAmable, Bruno. 2011. “Morals and Politics in the Ideology of \nNeoliberalism.” Commonalities of Capitalism 9(1):3–30.\nAmerican Association for Public Opinion Research. 2009.

    "abstract": "In the wake of marriage equality for same-sex couples, many states have introduced and passed laws that provide religious exemptions for certain services and benefits for LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) persons. The authors use data from a general population survey of Nebraskans as a mixed-methods case study to examine public opinion of religious freedom laws. Drawing on data from both closed-ended (n = 1,117) and openended (n = 838) questions, the authors show that opposition to religious freedom laws is quite high, as 64 percent of respondents report that they oppose laws that would allow business owners to deny services to gay men and lesbians. The authors outline how both sides rely on frameworks that are foundational to the American experience: the protection of rights and the capitalist economy. The authors argue that these appeals to broad American values underscore why these bills will continue to be introduced and seen as controversial despite low levels of support",
