McFarland*\"Yet as we look at how far we have come... we see also how far wehave yet to go.\"'INTRODUCTIONFor several months, a female worker has been subjected to a streamof offensive sexual conduct from a male co-worker. Everyday, uponarriving at work, she is met with questions and speculation aboutwhen she last \"got it,\" what sexual acts she has performed, andwhether she performed those acts with the boss. Furthermore, hercoworker physically assaults her, grabbing various parts of her bodywhenever possible. On several occasions, the coworker has proposi-tioned her in front of other coworkers, taunting her to \"have sex withme; you know you want it.\"Presumably, no individual should be subjected to this type of offen-sive behavior in the workplace. In fact, Title VII of the Civil RightsAct of 1964 (\"Title VII\") 2 prohibits such harassment. This statutoryprotection from abusive sexual conduct, however, is conditional-thesex3 and sexual orientation of both the harasser and the victim deter-mine whether there is protection under Title VII.4 For instance, underthe specific circumstances described above, the conduct presents aclear cause of action under Title VII5 because the woman washarassed by a male who presumably would not direct such conducttowards another man.6* Many thanks to my family, whose continued support has made everything pos-sible. In addition, I would like to thank Professor Tracy Higgins for her valuableinsight during the writing of this Note.1. 140 Cong. Rec. E1311 (daily ed. June 23, 1994) (statement of Rep. Studds).2. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2 (1994).3. The meaning of \"sex\" under Title VII has been debated since the statute'senactment. Generally, however, courts use the term interchangeably with gender andhave construed both terms to mean \"male\" or \"female.\" See infra part IIA (notingthe judiciary's narrow construction of sex under Title VII).4. See infra part HI (discussing various forms of sexual harassment that are notconsidered discrimination based on sex, and therefore not covered by Title VII, be-cause of either the sexes or sexual orientations of the parties).5. This assumes that the plaintiff would also meet the other requirements for aTitle VII sexual harassment claim. See infra note 104 (listing the requirements for aclaim of sexual harassment under Title VII).6. The victim of such conduct might have a cause of action under \"hostile workenvironment\" sexual harassment. See infra note 104 (discussing hostile work environ-FORDHAM LAW REVIEWIf the harasser victimizes a member of the same sex, however, thevictim's access to relief is less certain. Whether an individual sub-jected to such harassment by a member of the same sex would beentitled to relief would depend on the jurisdiction in which he or she islocated.7 In addition, the viability of a cause of action in this contextoften depends on the homosexuality of the harasser.8 Even then,ment sexual harassment, which involves sexual conduct that alters the work environ-ment). In analyzing a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment, theEleventh Circuit, in Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982), stated:In the typical case in which a male supervisor makes sexual overtures to afemale worker, it is obvious that the supervisor did not treat male employeesin a similar fashion. It will therefore be a simple matter for the plaintiff toprove that but for her sex, she would not have been subjected to sexualharassment.Id. at 904. Under the same reasoning, courts have accepted claims of reverse harass-ment where a female harasses a male. See infra note 109 and accompanying text (dis-cussing the expansion of Title VII to include claims of reverse sexual harassment).Cases of opposite-sex harassment illustrate that sexuality-both \"gender status\" andsexual behavior-is inextricably tied to sexual harassment. Catharine A. MacKinnon,Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case for Sex Discrimination 182 (1979)(defining women's sexuality as being comprised of both \"secondary sex characteristicsand sex-role behavior\"). Courts premise sex discrimination in these cases on the pre-sumption that a male harassing a female is doing so out of attraction, and thus wouldnot treat a male in the same manner. Discrimination is therefore established becausemen and women are treated differently. See infra text accompanying notes 94-97 (dis-cussing the \"differences\" approach utilized by courts in discrimination cases). As aresult of this presumption, however, the sexual orientation of the harasser becomesdeterminative: the harasser's attraction to the victim underlies the presumption thatthe victim was harassed because of his or her sex.7. To date, only the Fourth Circuit, in Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 77F.3d 745 (4th Cir. 1996), and the Fifth Circuit, in Garcia v. Elf Atochem N. Am., 28F.3d 446 (5th Cir. 1994), have addressed the issue. Although the Fourth Circuit foundthat the conduct at issue did not rise to the level of sexual harassment under Title VII,the court recognized the viability of same-sex sexual harassment under Title VII.Baltimore Gas, 77 F.3d at 752. The Fifth Circuit, however, held that Title VII doesnot cover same-sex sexual harassment. Garcia, 28 F.3d at 452. Even though othercircuits have not decided the issue, several circuits have indicated that such conductwould be actionable under Title VII. See, e.g., Baskerville v. Culligan Int'l Co., 50 F.3d428, 430 (7th Cir. 1995) (commenting that, although male-female harassment is themost common form of sexual harassment, there is a possibility that female-male har-assment or same-sex harassment would be actionable under Title VII); Steiner v.Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459, 1464 (9th Cir. 1994) (recognizing the possibil-ity that both men and women might have a cause of action for sexual harassmentagainst their employer), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 733 (1995); Saulpaugh v. MonroeCommunity Hosp., 4 F.3d 134, 148 (2d Cir. 1993) (Van Graafeiland, J., concurring)(\"[Hjarassment is harassment regardless of whether it is caused by a member of thesame or opposite sex.\"), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1165 (1994); Barnes v. Costle, 561 F.2d983, 990 n.55 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (acknowledging that harassment by a homosexual ofthe same sex as the victim may constitute sexual harassment under Title VII). For afuller discussion of same-sex sexual harassment and the underlying theories thatcourts have used when determining these cases, see infra part III.A.8. See infra notes 159-60 and accompanying text. But see infra notes 117-22 andaccompanying text (presenting cases that do not require that the harasser behomosexual).[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONhowever, some courts have found same-sex sexual harassmentunactionable. 9In addition, if the harasser victimizes members of both sexes, thereis, at most, questionable protection under Title VII.O For instance, ifa bisexual directed harassment identical to that described above atboth men and women, the behavior would fall outside the protectionof Title VII.\" Because men and women would be treated equally,there would be no discrimination based on sex despite abusivetreatment.12Protection under Title VII also would be uncertain if a heterosexualdirected the same conduct at both men and women. 13 In this case, theconduct presumably is directed at the women with a different purposeor intent than that directed at the men. Toward the women, the har-asser may act out of attraction, or with the intent of demeaning thewomen because they are women. The conduct directed at the men,however, attacks their manhood and demeans them for failing to fitinto a certain stereotype of masculinity. In at least one case such be-havior has been found actionable under Title VII due to the differentnature of the conduct directed at the men and the women. 4 Becausethe reasoning used to reach this result involved a strained interpreta-tion of Title VII analysis, however, future protection of such claims isquestionable.' 5Finally, if the behavior described above were directed at an individ-ual because of that individual's sexual orientation, there would be no9. See infra note 137 and accompanying text (citing cases that have found same-sex sexual harassment unactionable under Title VII).10. See infra parts II.B, III.C (discussing forms of harassment in which both menand women are harassed).11. See infra notes 162-76 and accompanying text. Bisexual harassment circum-vents the premise of opposite-sex and homosexual same-sex harassment-that be-cause of his or her sexual orientation, the harasser would victimize members of onesex to the exclusion of members of the other sex. In the case of the bisexual harasser,both men and women are treated equally, albeit poorly, and the harassment falls be-yond the scope of Title VII.12. See infra part II.B (discussing the \"but-for\" requirement as an element of TitleVII analysis that determines whether there was discrimination based on sex).13. This conduct has been termed \"equal opportunity harassment.\" See infra note174 (comparing an equal opportunity harasser to a bisexual harasser). For example,an equal opportunity harasser might direct comments at male employees that ques-tion their manhood with the intent to demean them. To the women, however, hemight direct sexual propositions and describe sexual acts he wishes to perform withthem. Although all of the employees are subjected to abusive conduct of a sexualnature, the conduct is qualitatively different, and therefore possibly motivated by gen-der in each case. See infra part MI.C (discussing the viability of equal opportunityharassment under Title VII and a recent case addressing the issue).14. Chiapuzio v. BLT Operating Corp., 826 F. Supp. 1334 (D. Wyo. 1993). Thecourt in Chiapuzio focused on the different types of comments and behavior that theharasser directed at both the men and the women, and determined that the differentnature of the conduct satisfied the \"but-for\" requirement in each case. Id. at 1338; seeinfra notes 186-90 and accompanying text.15. For a discussion of the unstable reasoning in Chiapuzio, see infra part Ifl.C.1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWprotection under Title VII. 16 Despite persuasive arguments that anindividual's sexual orientation is intimately tied to his or her genderand therefore falls within \"sex,\"' 7 courts have refused to interpret theterm in a liberal manner.'\"The above hypothetical illustrates that some forms of sexual harass-ment, although harmful and abusive, do not constitute sex discrimina-tion, and thus fall outside of Title VII's protection, often as a result ofthe harasser's sex and/or sexual orientation.' 9 Although Title VII hasdeveloped into a broad and effective means of protection from sexualharassment for women, a number of individuals remain unprotectedfrom the abusive treatment to which they are subjected in theworkplace.20Accordingly, an alternate cause of action must be created for thoseforms of harassment that do not fit within the paradigm of sexual har-assment as sex discrimination.2 ' Congress should enact federal sexualharassment legislation that focuses on sexual harassment per se-un-reasonable sexual conduct in the workplace-rather than sexual har-assment as a subset of sex discrimination.22 A federal statute shouldfollow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (\"EEOC\"or \"Commission\") 23 Guidelines on sexual harassment, focusing on thenature of the harassment, rather than the genders or sexual orienta-tions of the parties. Such legislation should emphasize the content ofthe harassment and its effect on the victim and the victim's workenvironment.Part I of this Note discusses the history of Title VII, including thepolitical movement leading to the inclusion of \"sex\" within the statute.16. See infra notes 202-16 and accompanying text.17. See, e.g., Samuel A. Marcosson, Harassment on the Basis of Sexual Orientation:A Claim of Sex Discrimination Under Title VII, 81 Geo. L.J. 1, 24-25 (1992) (assertingthat harassment based on sexual orientation violates Title VII because it is based onstereotypes of the proper sexual roles for men and women).18. See infra part II.A (discussing the courts' narrow construction of \"sex\").19. See Susan P. Woodhouse, Comment, Same-Gender Sexual Harassment: Is ItSex Discrimination Under Title VII?, 36 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1147, 1176 (1996). Wood-house notes that if the courts follow the case law barring protection from same-sexsexual harassment under Title VII, \"then heterosexual males harassed by homosexualmales because of their sex will not be protected, even though the circumstances aresimilar to when a female is harassed by a male.\" Id. (footnotes omitted). In addition,the rationale potentially creates an opportunity for a defendant to escape liability bystating that the harassment was motivated by his or her perception of the victim'shomosexuality, just as a harasser can cover his or her tracks by harassing members ofboth sexes, thereby becoming an \"equal opportunity harasser.\" See Ellen F. Paul,Sexual Harassment as Sex Discrimination: A Defective Paradigm, 8 Yale L. & Pol'yRev. 333, 352 (1990) (\"A savvy harasser need only note this anomaly and become anequal opportunity harasser.\").20. See infra parts III.A.2, III.B, III.D.21. See infra notes 91-101 and accompanying text (summarizing Catharine MacK-innon's theory of sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination).22. See infra part IV.23. See infra note 129 (outlining the EEOC's role in Title VII actions).[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONIn addition, part I notes that although the feminist movement's em-phasis on the subordination of women to men initially resulted in abroader interpretation of Title VII, courts today are unwilling to in-corporate a more expansive definition of \"sex\" into the statute. PartII explores the development of sex discrimination under Title VII,particularly the theoretical construction of sexual harassment as aform of sex discrimination. Furthermore, part II highlights the expan-sion of Title VII to include \"reverse harassment\" and sexual favorit-ism. Part III then summarizes the disagreement within the judiciaryregarding same-sex sexual harassment. Additionally, part III analyzesthe judiciary's approach to the situation of a bisexual harasser, as wellas a recent case allowing a claim of \"equal opportunity harassment.\"Finally, part III notes the exclusion of harassment based on sexualorientation from the protection of Title VII. Part IV sets forth a prop-osition for federal sexual harassment legislation that focuses morebroadly on sexual harassment as wrongful conduct in the workplacerather than as a form of discrimination. Part IV suggests that federalsexual harassment legislation should track the EEOC Guidelines, fo-cusing on the nature of the conduct and the effect on the victim's workenvironment. In addition, part IV discusses the evaluation of sexualharassment claims under the proposed legislation through a recon-figuration of the current standards for sexual harassment claims. ThisNote concludes that federal sexual harassment legislation should beenacted to address those forms of sexual harassment that do not fallunder Title VIl's proscription on discrimination because of sex. Be-cause not all forms of sexual harassment constitute sex discrimination,federal sexual harassment legislation should focus on sexual harass-ment per se, emphasizing the sexual conduct involved and the effect ofsuch conduct on the victim, while leaving intact the sex discriminationconstruct which has provided extensive protection for women in theworkplace.I. HISTORY OF TrriLE VIITitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted to provideindividuals with work \"environment[s] free from discriminatory intim-idation, ridicule, and insult\" 4 based on race,25 religion, 6 national24. Meritor Say. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 (1986).25. See, e.g., Firefighters Inst. for Racial Equality v. City of St. Louis, 549 F.2d 506,514-15 (8th Cir. 1977) (holding that segregated eating arrangements resulting fromthe exclusion of African-American firefighters from informal \"supper clubs\" was\"highly offensive\" and violated Title VII); Gray v. Greyhound Lines, E., 545 F.2d 169,176 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (finding that the defendant's discriminatory hiring practiceagainst African-Americans, as well as the employer's arbitrary discipline and discrimi-natory treatment of those African-Americans who were hired, violated Title VII).26. See, e.g., Compston v. Borden, Inc., 424 F. Supp. 157, 158, 160-61 (S.D. Ohio1976) (finding that, where a supervisor referred to an employee as \"Jew-boy,\" \"thekike,\" \"the Christ-killer,\" \"the damn Jew,\" and \"the goddamn Jew,\" such conduct was1996]498 FORDHAM LAW REVIEW [Vol. 65origin,2 7 or sex.28 To achieve such an end, the statute makes itan unlawful employment practice for an employer-(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, orotherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his[or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employ-ment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or na-tional origin; or(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his [or her] employees or appli-cants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend todeprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwiseadversely affect his [or her] status as an employee, because of suchindividual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.29Although Title VII initially was aimed at ending discriminationagainst African-Americans,3 ยฐ Congress ultimately drafted Title VIIwith the broad purpose of eradicating all forms of workplace discrimi-nation.31 Accordingly, protection under the statute extends to allbecause of the employee's religious beliefs and altered the conditions of employmentin contravention of Title VII).27. See, e.g., Amirmokri v. Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 60 F.3d 1126, 1129, 1132(4th Cir. 1995) (reversing grant of defendant's summary judgment motion on nationalorigin harassment claim where the employer called the Iranian plaintiff \"the localterrorist,\" a \"camel jockey,\" \"the ayatollah,\" and \"the Emir of Waldorf' and withheldjob benefits).28. See, e.g., Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 19, 21-23 (1993) (holding thatthe plaintiff had a cause of action under Title VII where a supervisor often insulted afemale employee because of her sex, suggested going to a hotel to negotiate her raise,referred to the plaintiff as a \"dumb ass woman,\" and made other sexual innuendosabout the plaintiff and other female employees); Meritor, 477 U.S. at 60 (recognizing aclaim of hostile work environment sexual harassment where the female plaintiffagreed to sexual relations with her supervisor out of fear of losing her job, and hersupervisor repeatedly demanded sexual favors, fondled the plaintiff in front of otheremployees, exposed himself to her, and raped her on several occasions).29. 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a) (1994). Title VII's coverage is fairly broad and appliesto \"(1) employers having 15 or more employees in industries affecting commerce; (2)state and local governments; (3) labor organizations with 15 or more members in in-dustries affecting commerce; and (4) employment agencies.\" Henry H. Perritt, Jr.,Employee Dismissal Law and Practice ยง 2.3, at 91 (3d ed. 1992) (citations omitted).Under Title VII \"[t]he class of potential plaintiffs is broader than that of employees inthe traditional sense.\" Id. (citing cases in which Title VII's protection extended tononemployees). Additionally, \"[p]otential defendants include individual supervisorsas well as employers.\" Id30. See 110 Cong. Rec. 2556 (1964) (\"[T]he basic purpose of title VII is to prohibitdiscrimination in employment on the basis of race or color.\") (statement of Rep. Cel-ler); 110 Cong. Rec. 2581 (1964) (\"[L]et us not add any amendment that would placein jeopardy in any way our primary objective of ending that discrimination that ismost serious, most urgent, most tragic, and most widespread against the Negroes ofour country.\") (statement of Rep. Green); see also Nancy E. McGlen & KarenO'Connor, Women's Rights: The Struggle for Equality in the Nineteenth and Twenti-eth Centuries 175 (1983) (noting that the Civil Rights Act was \"largely geared toalleviating racial discrimination\").31. See Williams v. Saxbe, 413 F. Supp. 654, 658 (D.D.C. 1976) (noting the \"ampleevidence that Congress' intent was not to limit the scope and effect of Title VII, butrather, to have it broadly construed\"); see also Quick v. Donaldson Co., No. 95-3387,BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONmembers of a given class, rather than only those who are traditionallyvictims of discrimination. As with racial discrimination, this has beenconstrued to apply to any member of the protected class rather thanjust those who are traditionally victims of discrimination, e.g., men aswell as women, and Catholics as well as Jews.32 Thus, the statute pro-hibits any employment practices motivated by the employee's or ap-plicant's membership in a protected class, regardless of which race,sex, religion, or national origin is involved.33This part discusses the political background of Title VII leading upto the statute's enactment. In particular, this part traces the role ofthe women's movement in the inclusion of \"sex\" in Title VII, and thesubsequent development of the provision into a powerful tool for wo-men against sex discrimination in the workplace.A. The Political Background of Title VII The Women's MovementThe political background of Title VII and the role of the women'smovement in the development of Title VII doctrine shaped and di-rected the protection afforded to victims of sexual harassment underthe statute. As noted above, however, some individuals fall outside ofTitle VII's scope. Nevertheless, Title VII's development into a power-ful tool against sex discrimination demonstrates the potential for astatutory remedy to effectively address sexual harassment as a wholein the workplace. At the same time, Title VII's history emphasizes theneed to fashion the federal legislation in such a way as not to lessenTitle VII's effectiveness in the realm of sex discrimination which en-compasses many cases of sexual harassment.With the civil rights movement in the African-American communityduring the 1960s came a \"renewed struggle\" for women's equality' 4Recognizing the pervasive discrimination against them, women cam-paigned for the presidency of John F. Kennedy, with the hope that he1996 WL 420381, at *5 (8th Cir. July 29, 1996) (stating that \"Congress intended todefine discrimination in the broadest possible terms\"); 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964)(\"Title VII is designed to give Negroes and other minority members a fair chance toearn a livelihood and contribute their talents to the building of a more prosperousAmerica.\") (statement of Rep. Humphrey); 110 Cong. Rec. 2583 (1964) (\"Let us rec-ognize that there are many minorities in this country.... For their opportunity, weseek to secure these rights under this bill ... .\") (statement of Rep. Kelly).32. E.g., Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas & Elec. Co., 77 F.3d 745, 749 (4th Cir. 1996)(\"While Congress' particular focus in amending Title VII to prohibit discriminationon the basis of 'sex' was to ensure equal employment rights for women, the SupremeCourt has interpreted the Act's broad language to protect both men and women.\").33. Thus, the policy of Title VII, as stated in section 701(a), reads:The Congress hereby declares that the opportunity for employment withoutdiscrimination of the types described in sections 704 and 705 is a right of allpersons within the jurisdiction of the United States, and that it is the na-tional policy to protect the right of the individual to be free from suchdiscrimination.110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964).34. Sara M. Evans, Born for Liberty: A History of Women in America 273 (1989).1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWwould work to further women's rights.35 After his election, PresidentKennedy created the President's Commission on the Status of Women(\"CSW\") on December 14, 1961.36 The CSW's mandate \"was to ana-lyze and recommend changes to end the 'prejudices and outmodedcustoms that act as a barrier to full realization of women's basicrights. ' ' 37 The Commission was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt andled to the creation of state commissions as well, thus establishing acommunications network that fostered awareness both of women'spervasive secondary status and the need to take ameliorative action.38The first major legislative victory for women arising out ofthis renewed feminist movement39 was the Equal Pay Act of35. See McGlen & O'Connor, supra note 30, at 169.36. See id; Evans, supra note 34, at 274. Kennedy's establishment of the CSW waspartially an effort to appease women voters who felt that Kennedy failed to fulfill hispromise of promoting the equality of women. See McGlen & O'Connor, supra note30, at 169 (asserting that Kennedy created the Commission on the Status of Women toappease \"outraged\" female supporters when only two out of Kennedy's 240 appoin-tees were women); Women's Rights in the United States: A Documentary History279 (Winston E. Langley & Vivian C. Fox eds., 1994) [hereinafter Documentary His-tory] (noting that the Commission on the Status of Women served other purposes,such as \"giving greater satisfaction to women, an important political constituency\").In addition, Kennedy was hoping possibly to quiet the struggle for the Equal RightsAmendment. See Documentary History, supra, at 279 (\"Equally important, the Ken-nedy administration hoped that the commission would help it deal tactfully with thepolitically controversial issue of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Con-stitution.\"); McGlen & O'Connor, supra note 30, at 169 (noting that some believedthat the Commission on the Status of Women was created partially in an effort \"to getthe 'administration off the hook on the equal rights amendment question\"' (quotingMary A. Baker et al., Women Today: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Women'sStudies 24 (1980)).37. McGlen & O'Connor, supra note 30, at 169 (quoting Executive Order 10980(Dec. 14, 1961)). Rather than advocating special protections for women, the CSWbelieved that \"equality of rights under the law for all persons, male or female [was] sobasic to democracy... that it must be reflected in the fundamental law of the land.\"Evans, supra note 34, at 274 (quoting the CSW's report). Accordingly, the CSW, asKennedy had hoped, opposed the Equal Rights Amendment, instead asserting thatwomen already had protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to theConstitution. Id38. McGlen & O'Connor, supra note 30, at 28, 169. These commissions \"laid thegroundwork for the future movement\" in three ways:(1) it brought together many knowledgeable, politically active women whootherwise would not have worked together around matters of direct concernto women; (2) the investigations unearthed ample evidence of women's une-qual status, especially their legal and economic difficulties, in the processconvincing many previously uninterested women that something should bedone; (3) the reports created a climate of expectations that something wouldbe done.Jo Freeman, The Politics of Women's Liberation: A Case Study of an Emerging So-cial Movement and Its Relation to the Policy Process 52 (1975); see also McGlen &O'Connor, supra note 30, at 28 (recognizing that reports of federal and state commis-sions \"documented, often for the first time, the extent of discrimination againstwomen\").39. The women's movement began in the 1800s with the campaign for suffrage,protesting \"discrimination that legally subordinated women to men and made a mock-[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATION196340 which was recommended by the CSW.4' The women's move-ment was active in the passage of the Equal Pay Act, and providedCongress with extensive information documenting the extent and theseverity of discrimination against women in the United States. 42B. Passage of 77tde VIIThe feminist movement's role in obtaining rights for women specifi-cally under Title VII is unclear. Despite the active participation ofwomen's organizations in the enactment of the Equal Pay Act,4 3 as awhole, feminist groups were noticeably absent from the proceedingsregarding Title VII.4 Although the severe unequal treatment of wo-men was well known, there seemed to be less noticeable outward sup-port specifically for the inclusion of \"sex\" in Title VII.45ery of the nation's claim to be a community of equals.\" Jennifer K. Brown. The Nine-teenth Amendment and Women's Equality, 102 Yale L.J. 2175,2175 (1993). Althoughactivity in the women's movement has occasionally surged on particular issues, e.g.,suffrage, the Civil Rights Act, abortion, etc., the feminist movement has been a con-tinuum that \"took shape in the middle of the nineteenth century and continues as atransformative force today.\" Id. at 2175. This continuous effort to achieve equalityeventually led to the inclusion of sex in Title VII, and a recognition of the extent ofwomen's subordination to men.40. 29 U.S.C. ยง 206(d)(1) (1994). The Equal Pay Act makes it unlawful to paywomen less than men for equal work and reads, in pertinent part:No employer having employees subject to any provisions of this section shalldiscriminate, within any establishment in which such employees are em-ployed, between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to employ-ees in such establishment at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wagesto employees of the opposite sex in such establishment for equal work onjobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility,and which are performed under similar working conditions.Id. The Equal Pay Act was enforced by the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"), whichwas empowered to bring suits to enforce the act. McGlen & O'Connor, supra note 30,at 170.

Judges and commentators have concluded thatSmith, \"an ardent segregationist\"47 who opposed the Civil Rights Billas a whole, suggested the inclusion of \"sex\" within Title VII in orderto demonstrate the absurdity of the bill, divide supporters, andthereby assure the bill's defeat.48 These commentators have insistedthat the amendment was proposed as a \"joke,\"49 and that the women'smovement had little to do with the passage of the provision. 50Nonetheless, at least one commentator has argued that the exten-sive work of the women's organizations is the sole reason for the in-clusion of sex in Title VII.51 Caruthers Berger asserts that theinformation revealed to Congress during the legislative hearings forthe Equal Pay Act \"was influential in convincing Congress of the needfor the sex discrimination provision of Title VII.\" Thus, Berger dis-misses the lack of legislative debate and history about the amendmentbecause the proceedings surrounding the Equal Pay Act revealed thestatus of women and made the \"exploitation of women in employment... a well known fact in American life.\"5346. 110 Cong.

Rev. 1071, 1076 & nn.39-43 (1989).The record of the proceedings supports this view and undermines claims that Smithwas genuine in his proposal. When introducing the amendment, Smith read part of aletter that he received from a woman in order \"to illustrate that women have somereal grievances and some real rights to be protected.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 2577 (1964).The letter noted an imbalance in the male and female population, and lamented thatthis is a grave injustice to womankind and something the Congress and Pres-ident Johnson should take immediate steps to correct .... Up until now,instead of assisting these poor unfortunate females in obtaining their \"right\"to happiness, the Government has on several occasions engaged in warswhich killed off a large number of eligible males, creating an \"imbalance\" inour male and female population that was even worse than before.Id. Although this may have been read in an attempt to highlight, in Smith's view, theabsurdity of the bill, it hardly reflects a deep commitment to women's equality.50.

Protection for Women Under Title VII: Another Struggle for theWomen's MovementDespite the controversy over the inclusion of sex within Title VII,the EEOC, the agency created to enforce Title VII, initially renderedthe provision virtually meaningless. Immediately after the passage ofthe Act, the EEOC itself \"still considered the inclusion of sex a bit ofa joke.

See Evans, supra note 34, at 276 (noting that the feminist movement and re-cent victory of the Equal Pay Act \"set the stage for debate on the 1964 Civil RightsAct\").57. See Franke, supra note 45, at 15 (stating that the rights women possess underthe Equal Protection Clause and Title VII \"reflect[ ] the results of a political and legalcompromise struck by leaders in the women's community and in Congress after yearsof bitter debate about both what it means to be a woman and what it means to treatwomen fairly\").58.

Thus, Title VII differed significantly from the Equal Pay Act,which the DOL enforced actively and successfully, and which gave real meaning tothe protection of women from discriminatory pay practices.1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWof sex in Title VII was \"aborted by the very agency set up to adminis-ter it.\"59 Alarmed by the failure of the EEOC to give effect to theprovisions of Title VII, women united and formed the National Or-ganization for Women (\"NOW\") and took a more active and visiblerole in the development of Title VII.6ยฐ NOW exerted extensive pres-sure on the EEOC to enforce Title VII and to hold hearings in orderto promulgate regulations regarding discrimination based on sexunder Title VII.61The EEOC finally enacted such regulations in 1972.62 Since then,the EEOC has taken a more active role in the enforcement of TitleVII,63 rendering Title VII a more accessible and legitimate means ofprotection for women.II. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS SEX DISCRIMINATIONThis part illustrates the effect of Title VII's complicated history onthe scope of protection from sexual harassment under the statute.Specifically, this part discusses the courts' initial skepticism of wo-men's rights, and the resulting narrow construction of \"sex.\" In addi-tion this part notes the development of the \"but-for\" requirement thatcourts used to determine whether there was discrimination based onsex. This part also discusses the culmination of the feminist move-ment's emphasis on the secondary status of women-CatharineMacKinnon's expansive \"inequality\" approach to sexual harassment.The acceptance of MacKinnon's categorization of sexual harassmentas a form of sex discrimination provided broader protection for vic-tims of discrimination and more fully recognized women's unequalstatus.59.

In May 1967, the EEOC held the hearings. McGlen &O'Connor, supra note 30, at 176.62. 29 C.F.R. ยง 1604 (1995).63. See infra note 129 (outlining the EEOC's role in Title VII actions). In addi-tion, Congress enacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Act in 1972, which ena-bled the EEOC to bring suits against discriminatory employers. Congress also passedTitle IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1972, which prohibited discrimination against wo-men in educational programs receiving federal funds. 20 U.S.C. ยง 1681 (1994). To-gether, these legislative victories give substance to women's rights. Title IX ensuresthat women will be trained and qualified for jobs, which, under Title VII, more wo-men will be able to pursue. Finally, under the Equal Pay Act, women can receiveequal compensation for these jobs. Most recently, Congress enacted the Civil RightsAct of 1991, providing for compensatory and punitive damages in Title VII actions,thereby demonstrating a full-fledged commitment to women's equality.

The Definition of \"Sex\" Under Title VIIIntegral to Title VII analysis is the definition of \"sex.\" In the ab-sence of legislative history regarding the provision, courts have de-bated the meaning of \"sex\"'  and generally have construed the termconsistently with the plain meaning of the word.15 Therefore, courtshave held sex \"to mean either 'man' or 'woman,\"' thus \"bar[ring]workplace harassment against women because they are women andagainst men because they are men.\"'  Under this narrow definition,sex \"encompass[es] only gender rather than any characteristic relatingto sexuality or sexual behavior.\" 67 Thus, courts have focused on atraditional notion of sex, rather than any broader conceptions involv-ing sexual orientation or sexual affiliations.In addition, courts have used the terms \"sex\" and \"gender\" inter-changeably in Title VII analysis.68 Although gender has been definedto include cultural and societal classifications of masculine and femi-nine rather than just biological classifications of \"man\" and \"woman,\"courts generally ignore this more expansive definition of gender, andinstead construe it to mean sex.6964. See Hopkins v. Baltimore Gas & Elec.

In differentiating between the two terms, the Dobre1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWThe Supreme Court expanded this narrow definition of sex in PriceWaterhouse v. Hopkins' by determining that sex-stereotyping vio-lated Title VII.71 In Price Waterhouse, the plaintiff was denied part-nership, despite an impressive record, due to what certain partnersdescribed as a \"macho\" attitude that \"overcompensated for being awoman.\"'72 In addition, the plaintiff was told that in order to increaseher chances for partnership, she should \"walk more femininely, talkmore femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hairstyled, and wear jewelry.\"73 In determining that Price Waterhouse vi-olated Title VII, the Supreme Court stated:In the specific context of sex stereotyping, an employer who acts onthe basis of a belief that a woman cannot be aggressive, or that shemust not be, has acted on the basis of gender.... An employer who objects to aggressiveness in women butwhose positions require this trait places women in an intolerableand impermissible catch 22: out of a job if they behave aggressivelyand out of a job if they do not. Title VII lifts women out of thisbind.74Thus, in Price Waterhouse, the Court extended Title VII's protectionagainst sex-based discrimination to include stereotypical notions ofbehavioral characteristics associated with being a man or a woman.The judiciary, however, has limited this holding to stereotypes thatrelate to male or female characteristics, such as aggressiveness or pas-sivity, that affect employment decisions, and have refused to considerthese stereotypes as they relate to sexual orientation. 75 Therefore,courts interpret the Supreme Court's holding in Price Waterhouse asprohibiting stereotypes that relate to an individual's sex, i.e., male orfemale, but not an individual's sexuality.76 Accordingly, courts haverejected arguments asserting that Title VII prohibits discrimination oncourt noted that \"[t]he term 'sex' in Title VII refers to an individual's distinguishingbiological or anatomical characteristics, whereas the term 'gender' refers to an indi-vidual's sexual identity.\" Dobre, 850 F.

Accordingly, courts have found1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWB. The \"But-For\" Requirement Under Title VIIIn addition to construing \"sex\" narrowly, courts have found that inorder to state a claim, a victim must show that he or she was discrimi-nated against because of his or her sex. This requirement has beentermed the \"but-for\" requirement-the victim's sex must be a \"but-for\" cause of the discrimination in order to state a claim under TitleVIIY2 When read in conjunction with courts' interpretation of sex,plaintiffs must show that they were harassed because they are men orwomen.Consistent with this strict \"but-for\" approach, courts initially wereskeptical of sexual harassment claims.83 In Come v. Bausch & Lomb,Inc.,S4 the court stated that \"there is nothing in [Title VII] which couldreasonably be construed to have it apply to 'verbal and physical sexualadvances' by another employee, even though he be in a supervisorycapacity where such complained of acts or conduct had no relation-ship to the nature of the employment.\"85 Because sexual harassmentwas aimed at an individual rather than a group, and dealt with \"per-sonal urge[s]\" and \"proclivites], '86 sex was considered to be merelyincidental to the harassment.Y Consequently, the victim was deemednot to have been harassed because of her sex, and she could not statea claim under Title VII.8 Instead, courts limited Title VII sex dis-crimination claims to cases involving disparate treatment8 9 and dispa-that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, transsexu-alism, or sexual affiliations.

See Paul,supra note 19, at 337. Disparate treatment could include, for example, a policy or[Vol. 651996] BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATION 509rate impact.9 0 Under both of these theories, the \"but-for\"requirement works to establish discrimination against a protectedclass such as women.C. The \"Inequality\" Approach to Sexual HarassmentIn 1979, Catharine MacKinnon published her well-known book,Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimina-tion.91 MacKinnon begins her book with the following statement:Intimate violation of women by men is sufficiently pervasive inAmerican society as to be nearly invisible. Contained by internal-ized and structural forms of power, it has been nearly inaudible.Conjoined with men's control over women's material survival, as inpractice of excluding women, regardless of their qualifications, from certain jobswhere sex is not a bona fide occupational qualification. See Calleros, supra note 67, at58-59; see also, eg., Rosenfeld v. Southern Pac. Co., 444 F.2d 1219, 1223-24 (9th Cir.1971) (finding that an employment practice that excluded women because they werenot considered \"physically or biologically suited for such work\" distinguished be-tween employees on the basis of sex when sex was not a bona fide occupational quali-fication); Weeks v. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 408 F.2d 228, 235-36 (5th Cir. 1969)(holding that sex was not a bona fide occupational qualification for a job simply be-cause the job required heavy lifting, and therefore, the employer violated Title VII byrefusing to give the job to a female employee).Under a disparate treatment theory, a plaintiff must establish a prima facie case ofdiscrimination. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). If theplaintiff meets this standard, the burden then shifts to the employer \"to articulatesome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's rejection.\" Id. Finally,even if the employer articulates a nondiscriminatory reason for the decision, theplaintiff may establish that the reason proffered is a pretext for discrimination. Id. at804-05.

Disparate impact cases involve employer practices or regulations which appearfacially neutral, but in fact disproportionately disadvantage protected groups. See Cal-leros, supra note 67, at 58-59.

Unless there is alegitimate job-related necessity for the requirement, it violates Title Vfl. See id. at 59nn.20-24 and accompanying text; see also, e.g., Dothard v.

MacKinnon, supra note 6.FORDHAM LAW REVIEWthe home or on the job, or over women's learning and educationaladvancement in school, it has become institutionalized. Womenemployed in the paid labor force, typically hired \"as women,\" de-pendent upon their income and lacking job alternatives, are particu-larly vulnerable to intimate violation in the form of sexual abuse atwork.92MacKinnon defines sexual harassment as \"the unwanted imposition ofsexual requirements in the context of a relationship of unequal power.Central to the concept is the use of power derived from one socialsphere to lever benefits or impose deprivations in another. '93MacKinnon's theory highlights the distinction between the \"differ-ences\" approach and the \"inequality\" approach.94 The differences ap-proach that courts utilize in discrimination cases rests on the premisethat similarly situated individuals should be treated equally. 5 Thus,the differences approach does not prohibit all distinctions between thesexes, but instead, only prohibits distinctions that are \"inaccurate orovergeneralized,\"96 and focuses only on those distinctions that are \"ir-rationally grounded upon a sex difference.\" 97In contrast, the inequality approach recognizes that \"sex discrimina-tion is a system that defines women as inferior from men, that cumula-tively disadvantages women for their differences from men, as well asignores their similarities.\"98 Because women have been subordinatedto men socially and defined as women by their sexuality, they are infact discriminated against because of sex when they are sexuallyharassed.99 The inequality approach centers on the second class statusof women as a group, and the powerful hierarchy in the workplacethat keeps women subordinate to men.\"ยฐ Thus, MacKinnon arguesthat sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination: \"Women aresexually harassed because they are women, in the full social meaningof the term. Sexual harassment is a clear social manifestation of maleprivilege incarnated in the male sex role that supports coercive sexual-ity reinforced by male power over the job.\"''MacKinnon's theory of sexual harassment as sex discrimination wasrevolutionary and it radically altered the case law regarding sexualharassment.10 2 MacKinnon is credited with creating the distinction92.

Rosa & Sullivan Appli-ance Ctr., 957 F.2d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 1992). A quid pro quo claim requires the denial ofan economic benefit either because of sex or because the plaintiff rejected a supervi-sor's sexual advance. Id In the case of quid pro quo harassment, the -but-for\" re-quirement conveniently is considered fulfilled because courts assume that a malesolicits sexual favors from the victim because she is a woman and would not similarlysolicit men.

Id Courts rejecting the requirement that the harasser must be homosexual forsame-sex sexual harassment to be actionable reach the correct result in that theyavoid the anomalous result of some victims of same-sex harassment receiving protec-tion while others do not. As a practical matter, though, it may be difficult to showthat a heterosexual harasser is harassing a member of the same sex because of his orher sex. Therefore, it is likely that a victim of same-sex sexual harassment wouldattempt to show that his or her harasser is a homosexual in order to clearly establishharassment based on sex. Thus, despite these courts' more liberal approach, it mayhave little effect in the end because, out of necessity, sexual orientation may still playa large role in sexual harassment cases.This point illustrates the difficulty of separating sexuality from claims of sexual har-assment. Classic cases of male-female harassment are premised on, among otherthings, the fact that men would not direct the offensive conduct at members of thesame sex because they are attracted to women. Sexuality and sexual orientation formthe basis of the rationale. Thus, the courts' summary conclusion that same-sex sexualharassment can exist regardless of the sexual orientation of the harasser tends to re-fute an underlying premise of sexual harassment, and offers little guidance as to how aplaintiff can fulfill the \"but-for\" requirement without referring to the sexual orienta-tion of his or her harasser. Sexuality, and thus, sexual orientation, are integral factorsin sexual harassment analysis. As a result, Title VII should include protection fromdiscrimination based on sexual orientation. In the absence of an amendment, how-ever, sexual harassment legislation would be the ideal mechanism for protecting thosevictims who fall outside of Title VII's protective ambit. See infra part IV (proposingsexual harassment legislation that prohibits sexual harassment regardless of the sexesor sexual orientations of the parties).FORDHAM LAW REVIEWily could have done so in the language of the statute. 2 3 Rather thanprohibiting discrimination by a \"member of the opposite sex,\" how-ever, Congress chose simply to use \"the unmodified word 'sex' whenreferring to the discrimination that is forbidden.' 1 24Furthermore, courts have pointed to the Supreme Court's use ofgender-neutral language when deciding sexual harassment cases.'2 5 InMeritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson,2 6 the Court used the gender-neutral terms \"supervisor\" and \"subordinate\" rather than sex-specificterms in deciding a case of male-female sexual harassment. 2 7 Thus,lower courts have noted that the Supreme Court's use of gender-neu-tral terms in Meritor reflects Title VII's protection of all persons, re-gardless of sex or sexual preference, from discrimination based onsex.'1 8123. See Ecklund v. Fuisz Technology, Ltd., 905 F. Supp. 335, 337 (E.D.

Since sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination, thecrucial inquiry is whether the harasser treats a member or membersof one sex differently from members of the other sex. The victimand the harasser may be of the same sex where, for instance, thesexual harassment is based on the victim's sex ... and the harasserdoes not treat employees of the opposite sex the same way. 132According to the Guidelines, as long as the harassment is based onsex, the same sex of the parties does not render Title VII inapplicable.Furthermore, these courts have rejected the view that Title VII ex-ists solely for the protection of members of discrete and vulnerable129. The EEOC is the administrative agency that enforces Title VII. See 42 U.S.C.ยงยง 2000e-4 to -12 (1994) (establishing the EEOC and enumerating the Commission'svarious powers and duties). In addition to promulgating guidelines which aid in theinterpretation of the statute, the EEOC plays an integral role in the procedural as-pects of bringing a Title VII claim.

Bisexual HarassmentAlthough courts disagree with respect to same-sex sexual harass-ment, all of the courts that, in dicta, have addressed the issue, haveindicated that sexual harassment by a bisexual' 1 is not actionableunder Title VII.163 Again, these courts have relied on a \"but-for\"161. Martin v. Norfolk S. Ry., 926 F. Supp. 1044 (N.D. Ala. 1996), provides anotherexample of this anomalous result. The plaintiff in Martin alleged twenty-two separateacts that, together, formed a course of harassment. Id at 1046-47. The most egregiousof these instances include having coworkers repeatedly grab at or swat the plaintiffsgenitals, being bent over by a co-worker while another one tried to stick a broomhandle into his anus, and being pinched. Id.Clearly, if Martin and McWilliams had fit into the classic model of male-femalesexual harassment, such conduct would constitute hostile work environment sexualharassment. In each case, however, the plaintiff was left without a remedy because hisharasser was of the same sex.In cases such as these that involve unwanted physical contact, the plaintiffs certainlyhave causes of action in tort for assault and battery, and possibly for intentional inflic-tion of emotional distress. These torts, however, fail to address the full implications ofsexual harassment in the workplace. See infra note 229 and accompanying text (com-menting on the inadequacy of a tort remedy for sexual harassment claims).162. To date, there have been no reported cases involving a bisexual harasser whoharassed both men and women. Nevertheless, the hypothetical bisexual harasser il-lustrates another form of harassment that would be left unprotected under Title VII.Bisexual harassment further demonstrates the need for sexual harassment legislationthat would protect victims of sexual harassment that does not constitute sex discrimi-nation, but is nonetheless offensive sexual conduct that unreasonably alters the workenvironment.The importance of the hypothetical bisexual harasser is borne out by experience.For example, prior to 1981, there were no same-sex harassment or equal opportunityharassment cases. Since Wright v. Methodist Youth Servs., 511 F. Supp. 307 (N.D. Ill.1981), however, there have been a number of cases involving same-sex sexual harass-ment, see supra note 114, and as recently as 1993, the hypothetical equal opportunityharasser became a reality in Chiapuzio v. BLT Operating Corp., 826 F. Supp. 1334 (D.Wyo. 1993). See supra part III.A; infra part III.C. Before Chiapuzio, the equal oppor-tunity harasser was just as much of a theoretical construct for analysis as the bisexualharasser is today. See Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir. 1982)(reasoning that where the alleged conduct is equally offensive to both men and wo-men, the \"harassment would not be based upon sex because men and women areaccorded like treatment\"); see also Johnson, supra note 82, at 742 n.85 (noting that thebisexual harasser is a \"hypothetical construct\" that courts use in analyzing Title VIIsexual harassment cases). Therefore, it is possible that, in the future, there will beclaims of sexual harassment involving a bisexual harasser. Without an amendment toTitle VII or the enactment of federal sexual harassment legislation, those potentialvictims' only recourse would be to quit their jobs or to accept their harasser's conductpassively.163.

Osceola Re-fining Co., 6 9 addressed a claim of hostile work environment sexualharassment of a female employee. 170  In recognizing such a claimunder Title VII, the court held that to sustain a hostile work environ-ment claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct was be-cause of her sex. 17 1 Thus, the court noted, \"instances of complained ofsexual conduct that prove equally offensive to male and female work-ers would not support a Title VII sexual harassment charge becauseboth men and women were accorded like treatment.\"' 17The Rabidue court's reasoning precludes a broader range of casesunder Title VII than Barnes and potentially leaves even more victimsunprotected. 73 While Barnes states that a bisexual would not discrim-inate based on gender, Rabidue forecloses coverage of a heterosex-ual's harassment of both men and women-the equal opportunityharasser174-- because the court considers \"harassment perpetrated byany person against both men and women [to be] beyond Title VII'scoverage.\"'175 Thus, under both courts' reasoning, when either a bisex-169. 805 F.2d 611 (6th Cir. 1986), cerL denied, 481 U.S. 1041 (1987).170.

See Wehren, supra note 77, at 101. For instance, Chiapuzio v. BLT OperatingCorp., 826 F. Supp. 1334 (D. Wyo. 1993), in which the court held that heterosexualharassment of both men and women was actionable because of the different nature ofthe harassment directed at each, see infra part III.C, presumably would have come outdifferently under the reasoning in Rabidue. Because the conduct in Chiapuzio,although different in nature, was equally offensive, the men and women were -ac-corded like treatment.\" Rabidue, 805 F.2d at 620. Therefore, Title VII would notapply. Id.174. In contrast to a bisexual harasser, an equal opportunity harasser is a hetero-sexual who nonetheless harasses both men and women with gender-driven conduct.See Chiapuzio, 826 F. Supp. at 1336-37 (noting the distinction between a bisexualharasser and an \"equal opportunity harasser\"); Johnson, supra note 82, at 733-34(\"The equal opportunity harasser makes gender-driven comments to subordinates ofboth sexes with an intent to demean and harm them because of their maleness orfemaleness. The bisexual harasser makes unwanted sexual overtures to subordinatesof both genders.\" (footnotes omitted)); infra part III.C (discussing Chiapuzio whichrecently allowed a claim of equal opportunity harassment).175. Wehren, supra note 77, at 101. The more sweeping analysis in Rabidue mostlikely results from the fact that the plaintiff alleged a hostile work environment ratherthan a quid pro quo claim as in Barnes. The Barnes analysis rests on the assumptionthat someone who sexually propositions both males and females is in fact bisexual,whereas this assumption is not necessary in the case of hostile work environmentsexual harassment. Conduct creating a hostile work environment may have nothingto do with sexual attraction, and therefore, a heterosexual may harass members ofboth genders. Other courts have recognized the distinction and excluded both fromTitle VII's protection. See, eg., Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 904 (11th Cir.1982) (noting that, in cases where \"a supervisor makes sexual overtures to workers ofboth sexes or where the conduct complained of is equally offensive to male and fe-male workers,\" there is no remedy under Title VII).1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWual or a heterosexual harasses both men and women, the \"harassmentliterally is 'nondiscriminatory.\"\" 76Although the bisexual harasser has yet to materialize in a Title VIIsexual harassment case, the underlying rationale of bisexual harass-ment exposes another type of harassment that, although harmful andoffensive, does not fit into the sexual harassment as sex discriminationframework. Thus, bisexual harassment illustrates another potentialclass of victims who would have no remedy for their sexual harass-ment 177 and the need for sexual harassment legislation. Although Ti-tle VII has proven to be a powerful tool for many victims of sexualharassment, not all forms of sexual harassment constitute sex discrimi-nation. In these unprotected cases, however, the harassment is just asabusive and demoralizing, and warrants legislation that recognizes theharmful effects on the victims and provides the victims with a remedy.C. The Equal Opportunity HarasserUnlike a bisexual harasser who is motivated by sexual attraction forboth sexes, an \"equal opportunity harasser\" is a heterosexual who,irrespective of his or her sexual proclivities, engages in offensive sex-ual behavior towards both men and women.178 The same rationalecourts use to determine that bisexual harassment would not be pro-hibited under Title VII would seemingly preclude equal opportunityharassment claims as well because men and women would be ac-corded like treatment.In Chiapuzio v. BLT Operating Corp.,'179 however, the court circum-vented the \"but-for\" requirement and held that equal opportunity sex-ual harassment is within Title VII's purview.' 80 In Chiapuzio, thesupervisor, Eddie Bell, subjected both male and female employees, aswell as one employee's non-employee wife, to a stream of sexualabuse. 8' Bell emphasized his sexual prowess to the men, and sug-gested that he \"could do a better job of making love to [their wives]than [they] could.\"' 82 In addition, Bell made sexually abusive remarks176. George, supra note 107, at 31.177. The possibility of a bisexual harassment case increases with the growingawareness, acceptance, and in certain states and cities, protection of sexual orienta-tion because more individuals will feel comfortable to reveal their sexual orientation.See infra notes 250-51 and accompanying text (listing states that do and do not havelaws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation). This result hasalready occurred in the case of same-sex sexual harassment, which prior to the 1980swas not a widely litigated form of harassment, but since has been extensively litigatedand widely debated.178. See supra note 174.179. 826 F. Supp. 1334 (D. Wyo. 1993).180. Id. at 1338.181. Id. at 1335.182.

Showboat Operating Co., 25 F.3d 1459 (9thCir. 1994). Steiner involved a case of male-female harassment.

[A]lthough words from a man to a man aredifferently received than words from a man to a woman, we do not rule outthe possibility that both men and women working at Showboat have viableclaims against Trenkle for sexual harassment.Steiner, 25 F.3d at 1464.Like the court in Chiapuzio, the Steiner court's analysis also focused on the differ-ent nature of the harassment directed at the women from that directed at the men. Id.at 1463 (\"Trenkle was indeed abusive to men, but ... his abuse of women was differ-ent.\"). As a result, the court determined that the plaintiff was harassed because of hergender.

Supp. at 1338.1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWabuse in each case was gender-driven. 193 As a result, the court heldthat the plaintiffs stated a cause of action under Title VII. 194Although this reasoning allowed a seemingly just result, its theoreti-cal justification is unsound.'95 Primarily, the reasoning appears con-trived to engineer a fair outcome. The Chiapuzio court separated theconduct aimed at the females from that directed at the males; both,however, were subjected to continuous sexually abusive comments infront of other employees.196 Essentially, the court neglected to con-sider the workplace as a whole. Analyzing the women's claims sepa-rately from the men's claims departs from, and effectively eliminates,the traditionally strict \"but-for\" requirement, because such a require-ment focuses on the treatment of both sexes to determine that one sexwas treated differently than the other sex.'\" By separating the plain-tiffs' claims, the court overlooks that both the men and the womenwere subjected to verbal sexual abuse. The distinction between whatBell said to each gender seems arbitrary; in the end, both were sub-jected to a similar form of harassment. In each case, the intent andthe method were the same: Bell intended to demean both the menand the women, and he did so through sexual jokes and comments.Because both men and women were treated equally, albeit abusively,there is no discrimination based on sex under the judiciary's differen-tial analysis.' 98Furthermore, the separate analysis of male and female plaintiffs'claims could prove to be inadequate in certain situations. A harasserpotentially could harass both men and women in a similar manner,193. Id194. Id195. See Johnson, supra note 82, at 743 (stating that the Chiapuzio decision rests on\"unstable ground\").196. Id at 746 (\"By separating the plaintiffs into separate gender groups, the courtdeclined to analyze the plaintiffs as a class.... [and therefore] easily concluded thatBell harassed each because of his or her gender and overlooked the more complicatedissue of law, namely, that Bell harassed employees of both genders.\").197. Id. at 743. Johnson notes that the elimination of the \"but-for\" requirement,which results from the rationale in Chiapuzio, would permit plaintiffs who wereharassed because of their sexual orientations to state a claim under Title VII withouthaving to prove that the harassment was based on their gender. Id. at 747. Instead,such plaintiffs would simply have to show that \"their harassers harassed them withgender-driven remarks characterized to harm them because they are men.\" Id. Underthe current state of the law, however, it is well-established that harassment based onthe victim's sexual orientation is not actionable. See Dillon v. Frank, No. 90-2290,1992 WL 5436, at *6-7 (6th Cir. Jan. 15, 1992); DeSantis v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., Inc.,608 F.2d 327 (9th Cir. 1979); see also EEOC Compl. Man. (BNA) ยง 615.2(b)(3) (stat-ing that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation). In-deed, Congress has repeatedly refused to amend Title VII to include discriminationbased on sexual orientation. See supra note 80. Thus, the Chiapuzio court's holdingcontradicts a well-settled and established line of case law and legislative history.198. See supra note 172 and accompanying text (discussing cases that preclude afinding of discrimination based on sex when both men and women are subjected to ahostile work environment).[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONsubjecting them to abusive remarks, simulating sexual acts, physicallytouching them, and even sexually propositioning each of them. Utiliz-ing the Chiapuzio court's analysis would require an investigation intothe harasser's motivations to determine whether the harassment wasgender-driven. 199 The harasser's motive in each case, however, maybe different-the harasser may be trying to belittle the men, whiletrying to get the women to submit to sexual acts with him. On anexternal level, however, the conduct is substantially similar in eachcase.2\"0 Therefore, by requiring an investigation into the harasser'smotivations, inconsistent outcomes may result for harassment victimssubjected to substantially similar conduct.Finally, separating sexual harassment claims along gender lines con-tinues to leave the situation of a bisexual harasser outside the protec-tion of Title VII.21 Because a bisexual harasser would subject bothmales and females to the same type of harassment and would have thesame motivations for harassing both sexes, the harassment of eachwould not be different in nature. Therefore, the harassment wouldnot be gender-driven. Instead, the sexual harassment of both men andwomen would be permissible. Thus, even where a court would allow aclaim of sexual harassment by an equal opportunity harasser, the rea-soning provides questionable support for future similar claims andcontinues to leave whole categories of sexual harassment withoutprotection.D. Sexual Harassment Based on Sexual OrientationIn addition, courts unanimously have held that Title VII does notinclude discrimination based on sexual orientation or sexual iden-199. Despite the obvious difficulties of such an investigation with regard to time,there is also the difficulty of probing the harasser's motives. Although motivation isalways an issue in Title VII actions, if a harasser knows that purely equal, non-gender-driven harassment is not prohibited, the harasser could easily tailor both his harass-ment, and/or his testimony regarding the harassment and his motivations, to protecthimself from liability. See supra note 19.200. See Murphy, supra note 123, at 1148-49. As Murphy notes:[S]ituations may arise in which the nature of the harassment experienced bymembers of both genders is indistinguishable.... In such scenarios, onecould not characterize the conduct as discrimination on the basis of gender.If, in fact, the nature of the harassment were indistinguishable, alternativeremedies would be more appropriate.Id.201.

Wyo. 1993)(noting a \"critical difference\" between the equal opportunity harasser who -intend[s]to demean and, therefore, harm\" the male victims, and the \"theoretical bisexual har-asser\" who presumably does not have a discriminatory motive towards either sex be-cause he or she is attracted to both sexes); see also Johnson, supra note 82, at 734(noting that although the Chiapuzio court found equal opportunity harassment to beprohibited under Title VII, \"the court implied that Title VII did not prohibit bisexualharassment because the harassment of both men and women was not done 'but-for'the individual's sex\" (footnote omitted)).1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWtity.202 This result is due to the judiciary's narrow interpretation of\"sex,\" and the plaintiffs' consequential inability to fulfill the \"but-for\"requirement.In Ulane v. Eastern Airlines, Inc.,2ยฐ3 the Seventh Circuit held thatdiscrimination based on transsexuality20 4 was not prohibited under Ti-tle VII.2 ยฐ5 The Ulane court focused on the lack of legislative historyregarding the prohibition of discrimination based on sex, and con-cluded that, in the absence of clear legislative direction, statutorywords must be given their plain meaning.20 6 Thus, the court held thatTitle VII proscribed discrimination because someone was a woman ora man, but not because someone had a \"sexual identity disorder, i.e., aperson born with a male body who believes himself to be female, or aperson born with a female body who believes herself to be male.

Arthur Andersen & Co. 21 3 and held that\"sex\" as used in Title VII \"should not be judicially extended to in-clude sexual preference such as homosexuality.\"'2' 4 Like the Ulanecourt, the DeSantis court focused on the lack of congressional intentindicating any interpretation other than a traditional construction ofsex,21 5 and concluded that such an interpretation did not include sex-ual orientation.21 6Title VII by its terms does not prohibit discrimination based on sex-ual orientation.21 7 In addition, courts have refused to make such anextension through a broad interpretation of sex that would includesexual orientation. 21s As a result, sexual orientation harassment doesnot fit into the paradigm of sexual harassment as sex discrimination.Short of an amendment to Title VII219 to include sexual orientation,\"presented to the 94th Congress and seven were presented to the 95th Congress, all ofwhich were defeated).209. Ulane, 742 F.2d at 1086.210. Id; see Holloway v.

See supranote 80 and accompanying text.220. Carolyn Grose notes that the exclusion of protection on the basis of sexualorientation makes Title VII a \"double-edged sword for lesbians and gay men [in thecontext of same-sex sexual harassment]: as plaintiffs, they fall outside the universe ofits protection, while, as alleged harassers, they fall squarely within its universe of lia-bility.\" Grose, supra note 202, at 393. Grose thus concludes that, unless Title VII isamended to include sexual orientation, the statute should not be used to regulatesame-sex sexual harassment. Id at 388. The current regulation of same-sex sexualharassment, which is not prohibited if based on sexual orientation, sends an impermis-sible message thatit is okay to make a workplace miserable for a dyke or a faggot, or for some-one who looks or acts like a dyke or a faggot, but it is not okay to make aworkplace miserable for a straight man or woman, or for someone who looksor acts like a straight man or woman.1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWthe most effective way to address these unprotected forms of sexualharassment is to enact federal sexual harassment legislation. Becausethe legislation would focus on conduct rather than discrimination, thegenders and sexual orientations of the parties would be irrelevant fora claim of sexual harassment.IV. TITLE VII AND FEDERAL SEXUAL HARASSMENT LEGISLATIONTitle VII has developed into a broad and effective tool against sexdiscrimination. In many cases, sexual harassment fits within the TitleVII framework, protecting individuals from demeaning sexual con-duct directed at them because of their sex. Other types of sexual har-assment, however, such as harassment based on sexual orientation andbisexual harassment, and possibly same-sex and equal opportunityharassment, do not constitute sex discrimination. These forms of har-assment, however, are nonetheless abusive and demoralizing for thevictims.\"2' This part emphasizes the need for federal sexual harass-ment legislation and suggests a framework that eliminates the \"but-for\" requirement and tracks the EEOC Guidelines on sexual harass-ment. In addition, this part discusses the evaluation of sexual harass-ment claims under Title VII and proposes an analytical framework forclaims under the legislation based on a reconfiguration of Title VIIstandards which would address other impediments to sexual harass-ment claims that exist under Title VII.A. The Need for Federal Sexual Harassment LegislationThe right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplaceshould not depend upon the sexual orientation of the harasser or vic-tim, the motivation for the harassment, or differential treatment be-tween the sexes. Under the \"but-for\" requirement and the currentdefinition of \"sex,\" victims of sexual orientation harassment are notprotected under Title VII.12 In addition, victims of bisexual harass-ment, and possibly same-sex and equal-opportunity harassment 22 3 areId. Thus, in the absence of an amendment to Title VII, federal sexual harassmentlegislation would effectively protect against sexual harassment while addressing theseissues.221. See infra note 224 and accompanying text (noting that same-sex and equalopportunity sexual harassment are no less harmful to the victims than opposite-sexsexual harassment).222. See supra part III.D. As Samuel Marcosson notes, homosexuals are \"unpro-tected by the law, and subject to whatever prejudices society (in forms such as sodomylaws) and individuals (in forms such as gay-bashing and harassment on the job) maydecide to inflict.\" Marcosson, supra note 103, at 38; see also Torkildsen PromisesHearings on Measure to Ban Sexual Orientation Discrimination, Daily Lab. Rep.(BNA) No. 54, at A-2 (Mar. 20, 1996) (\"[G]ays and lesbians are the 'last group sub-jected to legal discrimination on the job' .... \" (quoting Senator Jim Jeffords)).223. Although a claim of equal opportunity harassment has been found actionable,the court's reasoning is unsound, and thus provides questionable support for futureclaims. See supra part III.C.[Vol. 651996] BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATION 531left without protection under Title VII, even though such conduct isequally offensive and interferes with the workplace as much as, if notmore than, classic forms of sexual harassment.2 4 These individualswould be forced to \"run a gauntlet of sexual abuse\" in exchange forthe privilege of working because their harassment does not constitutediscrimination based on sex.' Thus, in order to achieve full equalityin the workplace, these forms of sexual harassment should be pro-tected to the same extent as traditional types of sexual harassment. 6B. Inadequacy of a Tort RemedyMore than one commentator has argued that sexual harassmentshould be addressed through the use of tort law as an alternative orsupplement to Title VII.27 In particular, at least one commentatorhas asserted that sexual harassment should be taken out of Title VIIand that a tort of sexual harassment should be created.' Separatingsexual harassment from sex discrimination, however, ignores the factthat sexual harassment often results from issues of power and domina-tion, and is often used as a tool to emphasize and perpetuate women'ssecondary status in the workplace. Catharine MacKinnon has re-224. See, Levitsky, supra note 77, at 1014 (noting that \"victims of equal opportunityand same-sex sexual harassment suffer no less an injury from sexual harassment thanvictims of opposite-sex sexual harassment\"); Murphy, supra note 123, at 1146 (statingthat \"unwelcome sexual advances, ridicule, intimidation, and other harassing acts areno less injurious and degrading to someone of the harasser's same gender than theyare to an individual of the opposite gender\").225. Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 902 (11th Cir. 1982).226. Carolyn Grose has commented that, without specific provisions for sexual ori-entation, any protection that might exist for lesbians and homosexuals under Title VIIis \"illusory and dangerous,\" because those protections are afforded on heterosexualterms. Grose, supra note 202, at 397. Accordingly, Grose concludes that \"[w]hether[a] statute takes the form of an expanded Title VII or a new piece of stand-alonelegislation governing sexuality in the workplace, it must prohibit discrimination andharassment on the basis of sexual orientation.\" Id. Although the proposed federalsexual harassment legislation will not specifically protect against sexual orientationdiscrimination, the statute removes gender and sexual orientation from the analyticalframework, and thus addresses all forms of sexual harassment, including harassmentbased on homosexuality or sexual identity.227. See, e.g., Terry M. Dworkin et al., Theories of Recovery for Sexual Harassment:Going Beyond Title VII, 25 San Diego L. Rev. 125, 137-46 (1988) (noting that tortcauses of action are \"attractive\" options for victims of sexual harassment despite theavailability of Title VII); Jane P. Mallor, Discriminatory Discharge and the EmergingCommon Law of Wrongftd Discharge, 28 Ariz. L. Rev. 651, 655-68 (1986) (suggestingthe use of common law wrongful discharge actions as a viable remedy that does notconflict with, but instead facilitates the goals of Title VII); Note, Legal Remedies forEmployment-Related Sexual Harassment, 64 Minn. L. Rev. 151, 167 (1979) (notingthat tort remedies provide \"realistic alternatives\" for victims of sexual harassment);Krista J. Schoenheider, Note, A Theory of Tort Liability for Sexual Harassment in theWorkplace, 134 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1461, 1485-94 (1986) (proposing a tort of sexual harass-ment that focuses on \"unreasonable interference with an individual employee's rightto work in an environment free from sex-based intimidation or hostility,\" and utilizesa reasonable woman standard to determine recovery).228. See Paul, supra note 19, at part IHI.FORDHAM LAW REVIEWjected the tort approach because it fails to recognize the injury sexualharassment causes to women as a group, and instead treats sexual har-assment as a harm perpetrated against an individual.\"2 9 Furthermore,the tort approach turns sexual harassment into an issue of morality2 30as opposed to an issue of \"economic coercion, in which material sur-vival is held hostage to sexual submission.\"231 Because sexual harass-ment is \"a social wrong and a social injury that occurs on a personallevel,\" the tort approach is inadequate.?32Moreover, even if a tort of sexual harassment were used in the lim-ited context of those cases that are outside Title VII's protection, or asan alternate cause of action, a tort remedy would still fail to ade-quately protect victims of sexual harassment. Primarily, a tort of sex-ual harassment would render sexual harassment claims unreasonablydifficult to maintain. For instance, Professor Ellen Frankel Paul pro-poses a tort of sexual harassment modeled after the tort of intentionalinfliction of emotional distress.3 3 In order to establish a hostile workenvironment sexual harassment claim under Paul's tort of sexual har-assment, the conduct would have to be \"extreme and outrageous,\"229.

Barton, Note, Be-tween the Boss and a Hard Place: A Consideration of Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v.Vimson and the Law of Sexual Harassment, 67 B.U. L. Rev. 445, 466 (1987) (notingthat \"the use of tort theory undercuts the goals of Title VII by ignoring the morepervasive problem of discrimination and instead claiming that the harm is the result ofan individual act\"); Note, Sexual Harassment Claims of Abusive Work EnvironmentUnder Title VII, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1449, 1463 (1984) (\"[T]ort damages alone do notacknowledge that sexual harassment injures a discrete and identifiable group by sub-jecting its victims to demeaning treatment and relegating them to inferior status in theworkplace.\").In her discussion of the use of tort law as a remedy for sexual harassment, MacKin-non refers to traditional torts such as assault, battery, and intentional infliction ofemotional distress and notes that \"short of developing a new tort for sexual harass-ment as such, the tort approach misses the nexus between women's sexuality andwomen's employment.\" MacKinnon, supra note 6, at 171. A proposed tort of sexualharassment that recognizes such a nexus, however, still treats sexual harassment as anindividual injury. See Paul, supra note 19, at 336 (proposing a tort of sexual harass-ment that \"emanates from the 'individual-rights perspective,\"' as opposed to the\"'group-rights perspective' MacKinnon endorses\"). As a result, even a tort specifi-cally tailored to sexual harassment fails to address the full implications of sexual har-assment in the workplace. As MacKinnon recognized, because the tort approachforces a choice between sexual harassment as an injury to the person or an injury tothe job, when it is in fact both, a tort perspective \"omits the social dynamics thatsystematically place women in these positions, that may coerce consent, that interpen-etrate sexuality and employment to women's detriment because they are women.\"MacKinnon, supra note 6, at 171.230. See id. at 173 (stating that \"tort sees sexual harassment as an illicit act, a moralinfraction, an outrage to the individual's sensibilities and the society's cherished butunlived values\").231. IL But see Minson, supra note 102, at 88-89 (criticizing MacKinnon's view ofthe tort approach for failing to view anti-discrimination legislation as \"one regulatoryvehicle among others\" that is compatible with tort law).232. MacKinnon, supra note 6, at 173.233. See Paul supra note 19, at 359-63.532 [Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONand the victim would have to suffer \"extreme emotional distress.\"-,In her proposal, Paul defines the terms consistently with traditionaltort law, requiring that conduct be \"so outrageous in character, and soextreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilizedcommunity.\"\"2 Such a standard would render it almost impossible toestablish an actionable claim of sexual harassment. The difficulty ofmeeting such a strict requirement is seen in cases where plaintiffs as-sert both Title VII and intentional infliction of emotional distressclaims. 36In Harley v. McCoach,'237 the court noted that the Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit \"has recognized that conduct in the employmentcontext almost never gives rise to recovery under this tort theory.\" 23Generally, the Third Circuit requires an \"extra factor\" to find conductoutrageous in the employment context.239 Specifically, an employermust have subjected the employee to both sexual harassment and re-taliation for rejecting sexual propositions.2 '1 For example, in James v.IBM Corp.,241 the court found that the plaintiff failed to raise a factualissue regarding her intentional infliction of emotional distress claimdespite her subjection to two years of joking and harassment, and be-ing called a \"bitch\" on two occasions. 2z Thus, although the court de-nied summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs Title VII claim,the court granted summary judgment to the employer with respect tointentional infliction of emotional distress.2 43Furthermore, Title VII sexual harassment claims, under current ju-dicially established parameters, are already difficult to maintain.2 \"234.

Although the standards for sexual harassment and intentional inflic-tion of emotional distress are different, plaintiffs commonly assert both causes of ac-tion because the plaintiff could potentially meet both standards in egregious cases ofsexual harassment, e.g., where the employer knew of the conduct and failed to takeaction, and the harassment resulted in the plaintiff's severe emotional distress.237. 928 F.

Although this Note asserts that an alternate framework is necessary to addresscertain forms of sexual harassment that currently are not covered by Title VII, it doesnot propose a statute that requires an emotional collapse before a victim has a rem-edy. Paul's proposal would make it even more difficult to establish a claim of sexualharassment rather than provide even-handed coverage for those victims whose sexualharassment does not constitute sex discrimination.249. Recent controversies over anti-gay initiatives suggest a strong likelihood thatnot all states will enact statutes protecting homosexuals from discrimination in theworkplace. These conflicts indicate that the equal protection of all citizens, regardlessof sexual orientation, lacks universal support among the states. See Suzanne B.Goldberg, Gay Rights Through the Looking Glass: Politics, Morality and the Trial ofColorado's Amendment 2, 21 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1057 (1994) (discussing the trial ofEvans v. Romer and Colorado's constitutional amendment prohibiting laws that pro-tected against discrimination based on sexual orientation). Although the SupremeCourt, in Romer v. Evans, 116 S. Ct. 1620 (1996), held such actions unconstitutional asa violation of the Equal Protection Clause, id. at 1629, Colorado's passage of a consti-tutional amendment prohibiting any laws that protect homosexuals from discrimina-tion demonstrates the existing animus against homosexuals and the dangers of leaving[Vol. 651996] BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATION 535may provide varying levels of protection. Causes of action would thendepend on the state in which an individual works-conduct whichconstituted illegal harassment in one state might be completely legalin another. Disparity between available state remedies has alreadyoccurred in the context of protections against discrimination based onsexual orientation. While homosexuals presently have protectionfrom discrimination in some states,250 they do not in others.\"5 Fur-protection at the state level. The Supreme Court found that Colorado's amendment\"withdr[ew] from homosexuals, but no others, specific legal protection from the inju-ries caused by discrimination, and it forbids reinstatement of these laws and policies.\"Id. at 1625. The amendment stripped these rights in no uncertain terms:Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments,nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school dis-tricts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or pol-icy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practicesor relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle anyperson or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota prefer-ences, protected status or claim of discrimination.Colo. Const. art. II, ยง 30b (1992).Colorado is not the only state to have entertained such a proposal. Oregon's Mea-sure 9, a similar action, would have additionally \"declared homosexuality to be 'ab-normal, wrong, unnatural and perverse.\"' Goldberg, supra, at 1058 (quoting TimothyEgan, Anti-Gay Backlashes Are on 3 States' Ballots, N.Y. Times, Oct. 4, 1992, ยง 4, at4). Even after the Colorado district court declared that Amendment 2 was unconsti-tutional, attempts were made in Arizona, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, andWashington to place anti-gay initiatives on November, 1994 ballots. Goldberg, supra,at 1081 & n.146. Only two passed. Id. at 1081 n.146. Even where similar initiativeshave failed, however, the number of voters supporting the proposals is alarming. SeeCincinnati Council Removes Sexual Orientation from Rights Law, Daily Lab. Rep.(BNA) No. 49, at A-6 (Mar. 14, 1995) (reporting that sixty-two percent of voters inCincinnati passed an initiative to bar laws providing protection from discriminationbased on sexual orientation); Maine Voters Block Restriction on Rights Laws, DailyLab. Rep. (BNA) No. 217, at A-13 (Nov. 9, 1995) (noting that an anti-gay initiativewas rejected in Maine with fifty-three percent in favor of rejection and forty-sevenpercent against rejection); cf. Fla. City's Discrimination Ordinance Retained, DailyLab. Rep. (BNA) No. 9, at A-12 (Jan. 13, 1995) (reporting that fifty-six percent ofWest Palm Beach voters voted to retain an ordinance prohibiting discrimination onthe basis of sexual orientation). Thus, even where these actions were defeated, asmuch as forty-seven percent of the voters favored the initiatives. As a result, it isunlikely that all states will enact laws prohibiting sexual harassment on the basis ofsexual orientation. In order to fully and equally protect homosexuals from discrimi-nation in the workplace, such action must be taken at the federal level.250. See Cal. Lab.

Sexual Harassment LegislationFederal legislation prohibiting sexual harassment should be en-acted 254 in order to protect individuals from sexual harassment thatdoes not constitute sex-based discrimination within the meaning of Ti-tle VII. 55 Although a broad statute focusing only on harassmentwould include harassment cases currently covered by Title VII, thelegislation would simply provide an alternate theory for individualswhose claims fit under both statutes. 6 Those victims who do notor marital status,\" but not on the basis of sexual orientation); see also Clinton PledgesSupport for Legislation to Ban Sexual Orientation Discrimination, Daily Lab.

IL at 238.254. The enactment of sexual harassment legislation would be within Congress'spower under the Commerce Clause, which typically has included regulation of a widespectrum of workplace behavior, ranging from workplace safety, e.g., the Occupa-tional Safety Hazard Act, to discrimination, e.g., Title VII. See Suzanne Sangree, TitleVII Prohibitions Against Hostile Environment Sex Harassment and the First Amend-ment: No Collision in Sight, 47 Rutgers L. Rev. 461, 484 (1995) (discussing Congress's\"wide powers\" under the Commerce Clause to regulate forms of coercion and compe-tition in the workplace); Dawn M. Buff, Note, Beyond the Court's Standard Response:Creating an Effective Test for Determining Hostile Work Environment HarassmentUnder Title VII, 24 Stetson L. Rev. 719, 720 n.13 (1995) (noting that Congress has thepower to regulate anything affecting interstate commerce, and as a result, has thepower to regulate discriminatory practices in the workplace); see also 110 Cong. Rec.6548 (1964) (\"The constitutional basis for title VII is, of course, the commerce clause.The courts have held time and again that the commerce clause authorizes Congress toenact legislation which affects interstate and foreign commerce.\") (statement of Rep.Humphrey).255. See Theodore F. Claypoole, Note, Inadequacies in Civil Rights Law: The Needfor Sexual Harassment Legislation, 48 Ohio St. L.J. 1151, 1166-69 (1987) (concludingthat legislation that regulates sexual harassment in the workplace should be enacted);Peirce, supra note 49, at 1100-01 (proposing that sexual harassment legislation wouldbe the \"ideal alternative\").256. A plaintiff could plead both theories, and the court could fashion an appropri-ate and fair, non-duplicative remedy based on the facts of the case. Thus, the overlapbetween the legislation and Title VII would be similar to the overlap between TitleVII and ยงยง 1981 and 1983. See Headley v. Bacon, 828 F.2d 1272, 1274 (8th Cir. 1987)(noting that Title VII and ยงยง 1982, 1983, and 1985 \"simply permit recovery for variousinjuries arising out of the same wrong or series of wrongs\"); see also Leon Friedman,Relationship Between Title VII, Section 1981, 1983, ADEA, the Equal Pay Act andState Causes of Action for Employment Discrimination, ALI-ABA Course of Study[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONhave protection under Title VII, however, could pursue a claim underthe sexual harassment legislation.The legislation's focus will be on the sexual behavior at issue, andthe effect on the victim's workplace environment. Primarily, the legis-lation will avoid determinations based on the sexual orientation of theharasser through the elimination of the \"but-for\" requirement. 25Although evaluation of sexual harassment claims under the new legis-lation would otherwise remain consistent with Title VII analysis, thelegislation also will address obstacles that unreasonably impede theestablishment of sexual harassment claims under Title VII through areconsideration of Title VII standards.1. Analysis of Hostile Work Environment Sexual HarassmentClaims Under Title VIIIn order to establish a claim of hostile work environment sexualharassment under Title VII, a plaintiff must prove several elements.First, a plaintiff must establish membership in a protected class, whichis fulfilled with the stipulation that the plaintiff is a man or a wo-man.1 8  The plaintiff must also demonstrate that the harassmentwould not have occurred but for his or her sex.259 This requirementestablishes that the harassment was in fact discriminatory, and resultsin the preclusion of certain forms of sexual harassment from TitleVII's protection. Additionally, the plaintiff must establish that theharassment was unwelcome ยฐ and \"sufficiently severe or pervasive 'toalter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abu-Materials 539,551-52 (1996), available in Westlaw, CA35 ALI-ABA 539 (outlining theoverlap between Title VII and ยงยง 1981 and 1983 and noting the advantages of bring-ing a case on both theories).The sexual harassment legislation would be an attractive option for plaintiffs whopossess causes of action under the statute and Title VII because the plaintiffs wouldnot have to establish discrimination based on sex. Specifically, they would not have tofulfill the \"but-for\" requirement that exists under Title VII. See infra part IV.C.2.a(proposing elimination of the \"but-for\" requirement under the sexual harassment leg-islation). In addition, unwelcomeness would be an affirmative defense for the defend-ant to raise and prove, rather than an element of the plaintiff's prima facie case. Seeinfra notes 283-85 and accompanying text (suggesting that unwelcomeness would bean affirmative defense under the sexual harassment legislation).257. This analysis will focus only on hostile work environment claims. The evalua-tion of quid pro quo claims is more straightforward, requiring only the grant of aneconomic benefit in exchange for submitting to a supervisor's sexual demands, or thedenial of job benefits because of the refusal to submit to the sexual demands. Seesupra note 103. These requirements would remain the same under new legislation.258. Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 903 (11th Cir. 1982).259. Id at 903-04.260. Meritor Say. Bank, FSB v.

' '26 ' In addition, the work environmentmust be one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive, aswell as one that the victim subjectively perceived as abusive.262 Fi-nally, in order to state a claim under Title VII, a plaintiff must estab-lish employer liability.2632. Analysis of Hostile Work Environment Sexual HarassmentClaims Under Sexual Harassment LegislationSimilarly, under sexual harassment legislation, severe or pervasivesexual conduct that unreasonably alters the work environment willconstitute an impermissible hostile work environment. Additionally,the standards for employer liability will remain unchanged. Thus, anemployer will be liable for its own acts, as well as those of its agents orsupervisory employees, regardless of the employer's knowledge or en-dorsement of such acts.264 When a fellow non-supervisory employeeperpetrates the harassment, the employer will be responsible if theemployer knew or should have known of such conduct, unless the em-ployer took immediate and appropriate remedial steps.2 65 In these in-stances, knowledge will be imputed to the employer if any of its agentsor supervisory employees had knowledge of the harassment. 66 Fur-thermore, an employer may be held liable even if the harasser is anon-employee.2 67 Employer liability will be premised on whether theemployer knew or should have known of the conduct, and whetherthe employer took reasonable steps to end the harassment.2 68 In thiscontext, the extent of the employer's control or legal responsibilityover the non-employee harasser would be relevant.2 69261. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting Meritor, 477 U.S. at67). The Supreme Court further elaborated relevant factors for analysis of sexualharassment claims, including \"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its sever-ity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance;and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.\" Id. at23. Psychological harm of the victim is relevant to the analysis, but is neither requirednor determinative. Id.262. Id at 21-22.263. Henson, 682 F.2d at 905. Employer liability can be established by showingeither that the employer provided no procedural mechanism to address complaints,Kotcher v. Rosa & Sullivan Appliance Ctr., 957 F.2d 59, 63 (2d Cir. 1992), or that theemployer knew of or should have known of the harassment, but failed to take reme-dial steps to end the harassment.

See id. ยง 1604.11(e).268. See id.269. See id.[Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONa. Elimination of the \"But-For\" RequirementFederal legislation prohibiting sexual harassment should track thelanguage of the EEOC Guidelines' section regarding sexual harass-ment.2 70 By tracking the Guidelines' language, the legislation will fo-cus on the sexual nature of the conduct, rather than on the sex of theparties or the motivation for the harassment. Thus, the legislation willprohibit harassment based on sexual orientation, as well as harass-ment based on any other motive.Accordingly, the legislation will eliminate the \"but-for\" require-ment that normally accompanies sexual harassment analysis.2 71 As aresult, a plaintiff will need to show simply that he or she was subjectedto conduct of a sexual nature and that(1) submission to such conduct [was] made either explicitly or im-plicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (2) sub-mission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual [was] usedas the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or(3) such conduct [had] the purpose or effect of unreasonably inter-fering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimi-dating, hostile, or offensive working environment. 272Sexual conduct will be defined to include \"sexual advances, requestsfor sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual na-ture.217 3 In determining the validity of a claim, the emphasis will beon the sexual nature of the conduct and the resulting effect on theindividual's work environment, 74 without regard to the sexes or sex-ual orientations of the parties.b. Reconceptualizing the Standards of Sexual Harassment ClaimsAlthough the standards of sexual harassment claims will remain rel-atively unchanged, the application of the standards should be refor-mulated in order to more effectively protect against sexualharassment. The reformulation will focus on removing unreasonableimpediments to claims of sexual harassment. For instance, fli deter-mining whether harassment rises to the level of unreasonably interfer-ing with the work environment, the severe or pervasive standard willcontinue to be used for analysis.275 The severe or pervasive require-270. See 29 CY.R. ยง 1604.11 (1995). For the relevant text of the Guidelines, seeinfra text accompanying notes 272-73.271. See supra note 82 and accompanying text (discussing the -but-for\" require-ment as an element of Title VII sexual harassment analysis).272. 29 C.F.R. ยง 1604.11(a) (1995).273. 1&274. The legislation will emphasize the effect on the work environment, not theeffect on the plaintiff's emotional stability. Although a plaintiff could offer evidenceof psychological harm to demonstrate the effect of the harassment, such a showingwould not be required to establish a sexual harassment claim.275. See Meritor Say. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (listing severe orpervasive harassment as an element of a Title VII claim).1996]FORDHAM LAW REVIEWment, as currently construed, however, presents an obstacle that is un-reasonably difficult for plaintiffs to overcome in all but the mostextreme cases.2 76 Thus, the interpretation of these requirementsshould be reexamined.The requirement, as the Supreme Court has framed it,2 77 suggestsan inverse ratio of severity and pervasiveness-the more severe theconduct, the less pervasive it must be, and vice versa.278 Seeminglytrivial behavior, if regular enough, would constitute sexual harass-ment.279 Courts have suggested this reasoning,280 but such an ap-proach has not been consistently applied in practice.2 8 ' Therefore,greater consideration must be given to the severe or pervasive stan-dard in the analysis of sexual harassment claims, rather than the impo-sition of a severe and pervasive requirement in order to establish aclaim of sexual harassment. In addition, beyond a certain thresholdlevel, evidence of severity or pervasiveness could be a factor in thedetermination of damages. 28Furthermore, under the sexual harassment legislation, the un-welcomeness requirement will be reformulated as an affirmative de-276. See Susan Estrich, Sex at Work, 43 Stan. L. Rev. 813, 843-47 (1991) (assertingthat the courts' application of an objective test that does not reflect what the plaintifffinds pervasive renders the pervasive requirement difficult to meet); George, supranote 107, at 20 (noting the \"difficulties of establishing pervasiveness\").277. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67 (1986).278. George, supra note 107, at 21 (\"[T]he more offensive a remark or the greater adiscrepancy in treatment, the less frequently the conduct would have to occur to beactionable.... Triviality alone would no longer be a defense if the behavior wereregular, ongoing, and discriminatory.\").279. See id.280. See, e.g., Carrero v. New York City Hous. Auth., 890 F.2d 569, 578 (2d Cir.1989) (\"It is not how long the.., conduct lasts.... The offensiveness of the individualactions complained of is also a factor to be considered in determining whether suchactions are pervasive\").281. See Kotcher v.

See Oshige, supra note 77, at 592-93 (arguing that plaintiffs should only have toprove that harassment (1) was because of gender, (2) treated men and women differ-ently, and (3) reflected \"invidious stereotypes about women,\" and pervasivenessshould be only an element of damages).540 [Vol. 65BEYOND SEX DISCRIMINATIONfense rather than an element of the plaintiff's claim -3 Requiring theplaintiff to prove that he or she did not welcome the advances unfairlyplaces the focus on the victim's conduct.' The initial assumptionwould be that the victim did not welcome sexual conduct.'-5 Further-more, evidence of the plaintiff's behavior should relate directly to thecause of action. Therefore, only evidence \"of specific words or ges-tures that reasonably encouraged or solicited in kind behavior\" wouldbe admissible? -86 General behavior of the victim, for example his orher mode of dress, would not be evidence that he or she welcomed theharasser's conduct. Instead, the defendant will have to point to con-duct that was directed at or involved him or her.Thus conceived, the legislation will prohibit harassing sexual con-duct without regard to the genders or the sexual orientations of theparties. A heterosexual male who harasses a male will be held liable,as will someone who sexually harasses another because the victim ishomosexual. As long as the conduct meets the requirements outlinedabove, it will constitute sexual harassment. The emphasis will beplaced on the alleged harasser's behavior instead of on sexual prefer-ences.' 7 As a result, those victims who cannot establish sex discrimi-nation under Title VII will have protection from their abusive sexualharassment. In addition, such an approach will continue to recognizethat many cases of sexual harassment in fact constitute discriminationbecause of sex, and will not disrupt Title VII's protection of thesecases.CONCLUSIONIdeally, Title VII should be amended to proscribe discriminationbased on sexual orientation. With such an amendment, sexual orien-tation harassment would be clearly prohibited, and same-sex sexualharassment could be more easily regulated. In light of the fact thatsuch an amendment is unlikely, at least in the near future, the mosteffective way to protect victims of harassment who fall outside of TitleVII's protection is to enact federal sexual harassment legislation. Byfocusing on the conduct at issue rather than on discrimination, suchlegislation would protect victims of sexual orientation and same-sexsexual harassment. In addition, it would protect against equal oppor-283.
