The views expressed in thispublication are those of the authors and not necessarily those of theNIHR School for Social Care Research, the Department of Health,NIHR or NHS.ABSTRACTPeople who transgress expected norms regarding gender and sexuality have alwaysattracted attention from social scientists. Early sexuality research, in which sexualities thatdiffered from the statistical norm were presented as perversion, travesty, sickness and sin,has, for the most part, yielded to a contemporary focus that explores the lived experiencesand realities of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. This body of workhas been underpinned by sometimes competing social and political objectives and, assuch, has employed a variety of research methods and methodologies. Some recent research has focused on the adult social care arena – the ways in which theneeds of LGBT people are acknowledged, recognised and addressed in social carecontexts. It is from this particular perspective that this review is written. The review chartsthe development of sexualities research and provides an overview of associatedmethodological approaches and perspectives, particularly those that have a specific adultsocial care focus. A range of examples from the various approaches is provided.The review includes a critical appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the variousapproaches. It addresses a range of methodological challenges associated with researchwith LGBT people, including the ethical context of research with vulnerable populations,the concept of ‘insider status’ and some of the problems associated with the use ofuncritical definitions and measurements of sexual minorities and how these may beaddressed in research that aims to be inclusive without running the risk of tokenism. The aim of the review is to enable researchers, particularly those working in the field ofadult social care, to recognize and acknowledge the diversity of human experience in theirown work, the ultimate objective being to improve social care practice.KEYWORDSGay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Sexuality, Identity, Definition, Sampling, Ethics  ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe author would like to thank Professor Jill Manthorpe, Gail Tucker, Dr Gill Hastings andMs Angela Mehta for their assistance in the development of this review.

Specifically, it provides an overview and review ofmethodological approaches and perspectives in adult social care research that haveexplored the worlds of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people who useand/or provide social care services. It also reviews the work, albeit limited in quantity,which has included LGBT specific perspectives in research that has a more extensive remitthan adult social care. It should be stressed, of course, that most social care research willalready include contributions from LGBT people, but their specific contributions are oftenrendered invisible, as there is no attempt to distinguish this group’s experiences fromthose of heterosexual people. The principal aim of this review, therefore, is to allow socialscientists, from a range of backgrounds, to consider LGBT issues in research that may ormay not be focused on sexuality.The review draws on empirical research, undertaken using both quantitative andqualitative approaches. Searches have been carried out in of a variety of academicdatabases, libraries and on the internet. The scope of the review is international (thoughexclusively English speaking) and, whilst necessarily addressing a variety of disciplines andsectors, concentrates, in particular, on research in adult social care.It first explores some of the problems associated with sexual categories and how thesemay be addressed in research that aims to be inclusive without running the risk oftokenism. In so doing, the review outlines some of the challenges associated with anuncritical use of sexual categories in social care research. It addresses the issue of ‘insiderperspectives’ and provides an overview of the historical context of research that has beendone on, by and with LGBT people.The review is undertaken at a time of significant legislative change in the UK prohibitingdiscrimination in public life and providing a statutory framework for the protection ofLGBT people: the introduction of the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation)Regulations (2003), Civil Partnership Act (2005), The Equality Act (2006) and the EqualityAct (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (2007). These changes, coupled with the inclusion ofsexuality and transgender in the six equality strands of the Equality and Human RightsCommission, suggest that the UK Government’s policy focus is becoming increasinglydiverse and equality-orientated. To date, however, definitions of diversity in the social care arena have been narrowlyfocused with a bias towards race and ethnicity and, to a lesser extent, disability and age. Amore comprehensive definition and understanding of diversity (in its myriad forms) willenable social researchers to build an evidence base from which it is possible to developpolicy and provide services and support on a genuinely fair and equal basis.NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research1HOW MANY LGBT PEOPLE ARE THERE?There is little available evidence that provides a reliable estimate of the numbers of LGBTpeople in the UK. Mitchell et al. (2009) noted that, whilst there exists a good deal of small-scale qualitative research that explores the experiences of LGBT people in public life, thereremains a dearth of evidence that details the actual size of the population in question.Reasons for this lack of evidence are debatable and varied. Betts (2008), for example,suggested that when people are asked to define their sexual orientation (or gender),there is a generalised failure to capture the subtlety that may be associated with varyingdefinitions and categorisations of sexual minorities. There is, therefore, confusion aboutwhat, or who, is actually being measured. Further challenges are associated with questionswhich invite a range of possible labels (in addition to heterosexual gay, lesbian, bisexual,transgender), given that ‘each of the sexual orientation labels carries a political historyand in making such identity choices participants may be acknowledging a particularpolitical positioning’ (Purdam et al. 2007). Added to this is the stigma that continues tosurround identification with a sexual minority, which means that people may be reluctantto position themselves as anything other than heterosexual.Another reason for the missing data on LGBT people is that questions about sexualidentity are simply not asked in large-scale surveys. The Census, the Labour Force Surveyand the General 3 Household Survey do not include questions on sexual orientation(Purdam et al. 2007). It is interesting that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) (2006), inthe consultation document 2011 Census: Assessment of Initial User Requirements onContent for England and Wales, demonstrated a clear user need for information on sexualorientation. The consultation concluded that responses had identified multiple potentialuses for census information on sexual orientation from a variety of respondents includinghealth and social care services. Monitoring of equality objectives, targeted policydevelopment and the equitable allocation of resources were among the most commonreasons for requiring this information. Despite this clear evidence of need for reliable information and statistics on sexualorientation, the ONS has again decided not to include a question on sexual orientation inthe 2011 Census:The ONS view remains that such questions are not suitable for the 2011 Census.ONS has significant concerns surrounding the issues of privacy, acceptability,accuracy, conceptual definitions and the effect that such a question could have onthe overall response to the Census (ONS 2006).Having identified the issue as a priority, however, the ONS has instigated the SexualIdentity Project which aims to develop a question on sexual orientation for futuremonitoring, test future questions and provide guidance for users of resulting statistics (fora comprehensive account of the challenges associated with counting the numbers of LGBTpeople, see Mitchell et al. 2009).NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research2Estimates for the actual numbers of LGBT in the UK population, therefore, vary widely. Forgay and lesbian people, for example, estimates range from 0.3% to 10% (Aspinall 2009;Betts 2008; Breitenbach 2004; National Centre for Social Research 2000). This widedisparity is evidence of the uncertainty that surrounds this subject. Estimates for thenumber of bisexual people are less widely available still, again most probably due toproblems of definition. In the case of trans people, Whittle et al. (2007) state ‘theconclusion must be that there is simply no publicly available statistical data on which tomake firm estimates’ (p.7). As a result: This lack of robust statistical evidence has largely prevented any meaningfulcomparison of the level of inequalities faced by LGB people relative toheterosexual people (or indeed differences between lesbians and gay men),particularly for equality monitoring and service development at local andorganisational levels (Mitchell et al. 2009). While it may be argued that LGBT people (particularly gay and lesbian people, given theestimates suggested above) constitute a sizeable proportion of the general population,non-heterosexual sexuality and issues of gender dissonance have been notably absentfrom social care research until relatively recently. A small, but growing, group ofresearchers has begun to explore the worlds and lived experiences of those people whodo not identify as heterosexual or who fit uncomfortably within a strict binary-basedgender system. This absence must be contextualised, however, because people who arenot heterosexual, in particular, have assumed a very particular and well-defined space insocial and, more critically, in medical or health-related research.RESEARCH WITH LGBT PEOPLE: A BRIEF HISTORYIt may be useful for social researchers to have some understanding of the ways in whichresearch can, and has been, used to oppress and marginalize LGBT people. A basicknowledge of the history of LGBT research is important in order to appreciate why someLGBT people may be wary and distrustful of research that claims to represent them.The early days of research into homosexuality were dominated by studies that relied on apositivist approach. This sought to distinguish a clear boundary between the subject ofresearch and the researcher, the aim being to produce objective accounts ofhomosexuality, with gay and lesbian people clearly positioned as the other. This work wasfocused upon understanding the causes of homosexuality and eliciting the presumeddifferences between gay, lesbian and heterosexual people. These differences have beenalleged to be anatomical (differences in height, hand and finger sizes, metabolism) andpsychological (greater susceptibility to mental health problems, for example). Explanationsfor these myriad differences have varied remarkably. They have been attributed, forexample, to the result of incomplete psychosexual development and genetic or hormonalanomaly. Such research was distinguished by its focus on the perversion and travestyNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research3NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research4Table 1.

(2002, p.241)represented by homosexuality in terms of either sin, sickness or, at best, the understandingthat gay and lesbian people are the victims of unfortunate biological imperatives. As such,it is not surprising that much early sexuality research was focused upon finding a cure fora trait that, until recently, was considered socially and morally offensive (Murphy 1997).Kong et al. (2002) suggest that research with gay and lesbian people has developedthrough a number of clearly defined stages: first the traditional model, outlined above;and then the modernising model, wherein research took on a more humane and benignaspect and ‘became a tool for modernist democratization and ultimately of social reform’(p.240) – an approach that humanised the deviant homosexual. Finally, they argue, comesa postmodern approach to research with gay and lesbian people wherein the researcherassumes a more active, reflexive and reflective role. They illustrate their point using interviewing techniques as an example (see Table 1).Kong et al.’s (2002) account of the changes in methods reflects the way in which theresultant data are conditioned by the cultural, political and value climates in whichresearch takes place (Riseborough 2005). The notion of ‘gay and lesbian sensibility’ in theinterview process also becomes foregrounded in the postmodern context highlighted inTable 1. This term reflects the way in which gay or lesbian interviewers bring their ownknowledge and understandings of gay and lesbian life to the research process (theconcept of ‘insider’ research is discussed on page 22).The more reflexive style of research that this model represents came about, Kong et al.(2002) suggest, as a result of the rise of the lesbian and gay movement in the late 1960s, intandem with a new understanding of homosexuality and, consequently, a new researchdirection. They conclude that, as the pathologising term, homosexual, with its essentialistovertones, was gradually replaced with the term gay, the positivist approach toresearching gay and lesbian issues was largely undone and the research style thatemerged became an effective tool for self-identification and ‘coming out’. Gay and lesbianpeople thus assumed a more central and visible presence in social research agenda andtheir formerly silenced voices are now more likely to be recognised and acknowledged.While the history of research into bisexual issues is less well-defined, it could be arguedthat trans research shares many historical features with lesbian and gay research. Thesearch for the cause of dissonance with one’s given gender is an active thread incontemporary trans research. A biological cause for gender dissonance is thus still beingsought. Moreover, the concept ‘gender dysphoria’, immortalised in the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association 1994) as ‘GenderIdentity Disorder’, has given much credence to the notion that a person may be ‘born inthe wrong body’ – a familiar narrative framework employed to explain one’s genderdissonance. There are those within the trans movement, however, who are becomingdissatisfied with simplistic explanations with their attendant medicalised, binary responses- diagnosis and intervention (that is, that a person must be either male or female and themedical community may assist, if it so chooses, to enable people to shift from one fixedNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research5gender to the other). This resistance comes at a cost, however, as without medical orpsychiatric diagnosis, trans people may not have access to sexual reassignment procedures.Evidence of this resistance is documented by Alleyn and Jones (2010) who state:Some trans people are working out their own formulations of their identities,their own sets of gender-free pronouns, and their own understanding of theiraetiology…they do not identify unproblematically as one or another sex or gender(pp. 57–58).Like the gay and lesbian movement outlined above, therefore, the trans community isresisting the accepted medical discourse of trans issues. It ‘challenges the absolute validityof the traditional view of transexuality and offers alternative and wide-rangingimplications’ (Alleyn and Jones 2010, p.58). Resistance comes from within and the transcommunity, like its predecessor the gay and lesbian community, is beginning to develop itsown research agenda which explores and documents, not simply the medical causes orresponses to their ‘condition’, but their lived experiences of marginalisation andoppression, becoming, in the process, a formidable force for social and political change(see, for example, Laird and Aston 2003; Scottish Transgender Alliance 2008; Whittle et al.2007).It would seem, then, that, while a preoccupation with ‘cause and cure’ remains prominentin research into trans issues, this particular obsession has, at least for the time being, beenlargely expunged from LGB research agendas. As noted above, this has occurred via thepowerful political forces of feminism and HIV/AIDS related research, into a more balanceddiscipline in which gay and lesbian people have begun to claim their own researchterritory (despite continuing offensives waged by various fundamentalist factions).Contemporary social care research can further facilitate this shift in emphasis by ensuringthat it is the lived experiences of LGBT that good research elucidates, with a view toensuring, not that LGBT people are relieved of their various sexual maladies, but, rather,that research may ensure fair access to services, care, support and the various other‘unearned privileges’ (Fish 2006) that are enjoyed, without question, by those who are notLGB or T.METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGESThe methodological challenges associated with research with LGBT populations have beenwell-documented (see, for example, Berger 1984; Hash 2001; Hash and Cramer 2003;Jacobson 1995; Kehoe 1989; McClennen 2003; Quam and Whitford 1992; Sullivan andLosberg 2003; Webb and Wright 2001; Weston 1991). These challenges include accuratelydefining, measuring and sampling respondents and the ethical considerations that shouldbe taken into account when working with minority groups and/or hidden and vulnerablepopulations: similar problems having been documented and addressed in research thatNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research6has examined the classification of people based upon their race and ethnicity (Dean et al.2002). The following sections explore these challenges in some detail asking, first, howresearchers may define, classify and categorise LGBT people, before moving on to discussthe problems associated with sampling this population and the ethical considerations it isnecessary to respect when working with LGBT people.WHO IS LGBT? IDENTITY AND DEFINITIONWhen thinking about methodological approaches in social care research that incorporateor address issues of sexuality and/or gender, it is important to consider the ways in whichlanguage, the definitions used to describe people and the categories they are included in,may impact upon both them as participants in the research process and the researchprocess itself. Giving some thought to these matters is critical, as, in both quantitative andqualitative research, accurate definition and classification are essential to accuratelyanalyse statistical data and, in the latter, to describe and explore the various definitionsand categories appended to certain groups of people (McManus 2003). As such, theseissues help shape a project’s methodological trajectory and credibility.THINKING ABOUT CATEGORIES When studying gay, lesbian and bisexual sexuality and/or transgender issues, manyresearchers have employed an inclusive, if, arguably, misleading, acronym. The ubiquitousLGBT denotes a hypothetically interconnected assortment of sexual minority populationsincluding Lesbian (L), Gay (G), Bisexual (B) and Transgender (T). This acronym is particularlynotable for its extraordinary elasticity. It has been variously re-modelled to include otherminority groupings and, in so doing, has become a convenient, though arguably misused,tool for the demonstration of inclusivity. Indeed, some work has gone so far as to expandthe acronym to include Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender/Transsexual/Two-SpiritedQueer/Questioning and Intersex people (LGBTTTQQI), thus aiming to exclude no one. This elasticity is methodologically problematic, however, as historically, LGBT research thathas claimed to be inclusive of bisexual and trans people has, in fact, concentrated almostexclusively on the L and G constituents of the acronym, at the expense of the B and T. Thissimply reinforces the marginalisation and invisibility of bisexual and transgender people(Brotman et al. 2002). It could be argued, therefore, that bisexuality warrants separateresearch attention and that ‘an identity constructed around deeply felt unhappiness withone’s biological sex is different in kind from one constructed around same-sex desire’(Wilton 2000, p.xviii). Thus, to uncritically combine lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgenderidentities (and/or other minority groupings) in a research project’s methodology withoutconsideration of these issues is, perhaps, to risk muddying its methodological andtheoretical waters. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research7Furthermore, the LGBT acronym supposes an arguably false unity between people forwhom the only similarity may be their identification with a sexual minority. A person’ssexuality is not necessarily their predominant defining characteristic, nor one that theywould necessarily use to define themselves. Thus to group together gay men and lesbianwomen, for example, assuming that a gay or lesbian identity ‘made these men andwomen more similar than gender made them unique’ would be methodologicallyindefensible (Quam 1993, p.11). As Wahler and Gabbay (1997) argue:Gay men and lesbians are more different from one another than they are similar,both in their orientation and their gender… Thus any attempt to join them for thepurpose of sociological research is both artificial and misleading. Joining themunder one umbrella of research on ‘homosexuals’ has the effect of diluting ourunderstanding of each and trivialising the experience of both (p.2).This perspective should be tempered, however, with a degree of pragmatism and whilst itcould be argued that each sexual minority should be given separate consideration in socialcare research, this is not always possible nor, it should be stressed, advisable. While there is no reason, therefore, to suggest that those who share a certaincharacteristic necessarily share others, there are critical elements of gay and lesbianpeople’s lives that serve to forge a sense of community (however that term might bedefined) – issues of ‘stigma, prejudice, legal inequality, a history of oppression, and thelike’ (Weeks 2000, p.183). Gay men and lesbian women thus share history of oppressionthat may invalidate other more obvious social divisions (Coon 2003). The same may, ofcourse, be said for bisexual people who occupy a very particular place on the sexualminorities map, often being discriminated against from both the hetero and homo sidesof the various sexual divisions. Similarly, trans people may also present the argument thatthe ‘T’ in LGBT earns its place by virtue of the fact that gender, as much as sexuality, is adisputed and misused notion and, as a result, people whose given gender does not fittheir own perceptions and needs are marginalised and oppressed. This, the argumentproposes, means that the link between LGB and ‘T’ is clear – the acronym, from thisperspective, subsumes those who contravene heteronormative expectations of both sexualand gendered behaviour that is governed by a strict, but arguably arbitrary, binary system. A further issue relates to how the language of omission may bias a methodology, perhapsunintentionally – another reason for researchers to be particularly sensitive to semanticswhen planning a study and a particular problem, perhaps, in research that is notspecifically focused on sexualities. When coding the sex of respondents, for example,providing only two categories may, perhaps unintentionally, exclude those who aretransgender or people who identify as intersex (that is, people who have elements of bothmale and female biology). Moreover, researcher-suggested categories simply may not fitthe ways in which participants would ordinarily refer to themselves. The First Out report(Beyond Barriers 2003) is a study that directly addresses this issue, asking respondents tocategorise themselves ‘male’, ‘female’ or ‘other’. The latter designation attracted 40NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research8participants who defined themselves thus:\u0000 Transgender (10)\u0000 Missing (8)\u0000 Gay (3)\u0000 No gender (3)\u0000 Crossdresser\u0000 F–M transsexual\u0000 F to M transgender man\u0000 F/M\u0000 Female/Male\u0000 Inbetweeny\u0000 Intersexed\u0000 Male to female transsexual\u0000 Transsexual M + F\u0000 Transgender (intersex)\u0000 Transgender (post op)\u0000 Transgender F T M\u0000 Transgendered M/F\u0000 Transman(Beyond Barriers 2003, p.6). Furthermore, trans people may not, of course, identify as ‘trans’ or be visibly ‘trans’. Thereport Transgender Experiences in Scotland (Scottish Transgender Alliance 2008) forexample, found that 35 per cent of men who had transitioned from female and 47 percent of women who had transitioned from male simply categorised themselves in theirnew gender (see Figure 1) (Scottish Transgender Alliance 2008, p.9).Providing an acknowledgement of the limitations of a binary approach to theclassification of gender and a range of possible identities that are generally accepted bythe community under study may reassure participants that they will be properly accountedfor in a study’s findings. This was an approach taken by Whittle et al. (2007) in a study thatexplored trans people’s experiences of inequality and discrimination in social life. Theresearchers offered participants definitions such as male-to-male (transvestite orNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research9transgender or transsexual or trans person); man with a transsexual background; male tofemale (transvestite or transgender or transsexual or trans person); woman with atranssexual background, and other trans identified eg. agendered, polygendered and,non-gendered.

(2006, p.12), in a study that explored the needs and experiences ofLGBT people who live, work and socialise in the London Borough of Lambeth  exploredparticipants’ gender identity thus: Gender was explored with four questions:• Are you...? male / female / intersex• Is that the sex you were born into? no / yes• Are you a Trans person (Transexual / Transgender)? no / yes[If yes] How do you describe yourself?In total, 326 (70%) respondents identified as male, 133 (29%) as female and 4 (1%) asintersex. Nineteen respondents (4% of all) indicated that their current sex was not thesex they were born into (5 males, 12 females and 2 intersex people).Twenty-four respondents (5% of all) identified as Trans (10 males, 12 females and 2 intersex people), of which 23 gave further description, including:• a switch • a parliamentarian • Femail • Female • Female or Transexual Female •Female trapped in a male body • FTM or Transman • pre-op, probably pre-diagnosisTranswoman • m~f Transexual wanting surgery • Male-to-female • Male-to-femaleTranssexual - Full time pre-operative • pre-op M-F Transexual • pre-op Transexual •Shemale • Trans-man, male • Transgendered (2 respondents) • TransgenderedTransvestite • Transsexual (3 respondents) • Transvestite • TS •Gender identity by Trans status (N=463, missing 0)By Trans statusNot Trans TransMale Was that the sex you were born into? Yes 313 8No 3 2Female Was that the sex you were born into? Yes 121 –No – 12Intersex Was that the sex you were born into? Yes 2 –No – 2Self-definition and categorisation are, therefore, particularly important for trans people: itis a means of resisting the pathologising terms often used to describe them (Whittle et al.2007).Categorising people who identify as anything other than heterosexual, or for whom abinary model of gender is inadequate, is clearly challenging and care should be taken todemonstrate that consideration has been given to these issues when planning a study.Similarly problematic for researchers wanting to include LGBT populations is the issue oflanguage – each of the terms, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender have associatedhistorical, social and political associations – they are not simply words and LGBT peopleare, understandably sensitive to the use of language in social research. As such, terms suchas ‘homosexual’ and ‘transsexual’ should perhaps be rejected as medically crafted,homogenous and outdated terms rooted firmly in psychiatric and medical discourse (in thecontext of trans research, however, there appears to be a reluctance to disregard the‘transexual’ epithet altogether).In an attempt to circumnavigate these semantic challenges, Heaphy et al. (2003) in a studyexploring the lives of LGB people over 50 years of age, use the term ‘non-heterosexual’people as an inclusive expression that is intended to subsume gay, lesbian, and bisexualidentities. This term is also problematic, however, in that it denotes only an inherent lackof heterosexuality, presenting LGB identities as what they are not. As such, the terms gaymen, lesbian women, bisexual people and transgendered, or trans people, are thesuggested terms for research that aims to be genuinely inclusive. This is contemporarylanguage that is widely used by LGBT people.DEFINING THE RESEARCH POPULATIONA related issue to the use of language and categorisation is definition – who, in a researchcontext, is authentically LGB or T? Methodology should, therefore, give some attention tohow LGBT people are defined and seek to understand the rationale for preferreddefinitions. The issue is particularly problematic, as the notion of what makes a person‘gay’, ‘lesbian’, ‘bisexual’ or ‘transgender’ can, of course, be framed in any number of ways. Kinsey et al. (1948), for example, employed a behavioural definition for lesbian womenand gay men in the United States. In this early work, 4 per cent of the respondent samplereported a lifelong pattern of same-sex sexual behaviour, whilst 10 per cent engaged insame-sex sexual behaviour for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55 years,and 25 per cent of the sample engaged in more than one same-sex sexual experiencebetween the same ages. Similarly, the more recent UK National Survey of Sexual Attitudesand Lifestyles (National Centre for Social Research 2000) asked whether respondents hadhad a same-sex sexual partner in the last five years and in their lifetime. These definitionsare based upon narrow interpretations of sexual behaviour – who does what with whom –and thus fail to address the notion of sexual identity or desire, which is far more complex. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research12It is fair to question, therefore, what constitutes the best definition of a ‘gay man’, a‘lesbian woman’ or a bisexual or trans person and, further, which definitions are the mostaccurate and why this might be so. For lesbians in particular, issues of definition have beenthe site of innumerable tensions. Again, the question might be asked, who is the ‘real’lesbian and how is she most properly defined? The answer, Kitzinger (1987) suggests,holds the key to the manner in which lesbians’ accounts of their life experiences havetended to be invalidated, pathologised and ‘subjected to a severe process of selection’(p.66), the net result being that only a small number of lesbians’ accounts of theirexperiences are perceived as valid and reliable in research terms, thus restricting the rangeof data available to the researcher. To date, researchers have tended to ‘define lesbianismin privatised terms as a sexual orientation or type of sexual activity’ (Kitzinger 1987, p.67)and, as such, the lesbian woman is unambiguously defined by the nature of her bodily,sexual activity (with another woman). Some lesbian women would not, however, ascribeto such a narrow conceptualisation. For some women, lesbianism is a personal andpolitical standpoint that may, or may not, involve intimate relationships with otherwomen. Moreover, there are those who choose celibacy, but who still identify as lesbian.For bisexual people problems of definition are, perhaps, more complex still, and it hasbeen suggested that ‘the question of definition seems to have been intentionally avoidedrather than overlooked’ and that, in fact, the fluid nature of bisexuality defies attempts atdefinitions (Berenson 2002, p.12). A pragmatic definition of transgender is, however, provided by Whittle et al. (2007):Transgender is an umbrella term, coined in the US, used to include people whoselifestyles appear to conflict with the gender norms of society. It includes manytypes of people and lifestyles. In the use of the broad term, a transgender personcrosses the conventional boundaries of gender; in clothing; in presentingthemselves; even as far as having multiple surgical procedures to be fully bodilyreassigned in their preferred gender role (p.6).Some studies have circumnavigated the notion of definition by allowing individuals tosimply self-identify (see, for example, Gibbons et al. 2007; Heaphy et al. 2003; Quam andWhitford 1992). This pragmatic approach is not without its own difficulties, however, asMcManus (2003) states:Many recent research projects have cited respondents’ own self-identification as‘gay’, ‘lesbian’, ‘bisexual’, ‘transgender’ or ‘other’ as the definition used toestablish eligibility for a study, and for analysis purposes. This means that differentconceptions of what constitutes sexual orientation – including attraction, identity,lifestyle, partnership and community – may co-exist within a single study. Whilethis sometimes may not matter, for particular policy areas the definition may bedirectly relevant to the topic being studied (p.16).NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research13Moreover, some people would not choose to define themselves with any of the customary‘non-heterosexual’ terms, such as ‘homosexual’, ‘bisexual’, ‘transexual, and so on. This isbecause for some people, they are representative of strictly behavioural, pathologising,terms that should be actively resisted by those keen to challenge the presumed immutablenature of the various sexual categories. There may also be those who have chosen not toassociate or identify with customary categorisations and language, given a damaginghistory of pathologisation and repression.As noted above, however, many studies that have focused on the life experiences of LGBTpeople have employed a strategy of self-definition (Hare 1994; Nardi and Sherrod 1994;Pilkington and D’Augelli 1995) and, in this body of work, the definition of ‘gay’ ‘lesbian’‘bisexual’ and, less commonly, ‘transgender’ simply denotes those people who voluntarilylabel themselves thus (Martin and Knox 2000). It may be hypothesised that, given thestigma surrounding LGBT labels, those who are not LGBT would be unlikely to sanctionsuch a label for themselves, as this would be a self-ascribed admission of deviance (Alonzoand Reynolds 1995; Martin and Knox 2000). Methodologically, perhaps, this ensures thatthose who do identify themselves as LGB or T are ‘the genuine article’.Perhaps the best advice would be to define the population under study in the mannerthat best fits the purposes of an individual study (Rothblum 1994). Indeed, McManus(2003), in the most comprehensive review of sexuality methodologies in the UK to date,argues that:…definitions need to be selected to be appropriate to the topic being researched;there needs to be clear descriptions in research reports regarding what particularcategories were used with respondents and how the categories being reportedwere derived; and that definitions need to be regularly reviewed to ensure thatthey are currently relevant and meaningful to the population being studied orconsulted, as well as to other users of the data (p.15).McManus (2003) goes on to suggest that, while it is perhaps not possible to account forevery sexual nuance or subtlety in the language, categorisation and definitions used insexualities research, difference and diversity should, where possible, be acknowledged andcarefully built and written into research methodologies.SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTIONOnce defined, however, it is then necessary to sample the research population under studyand, given some of the issues outlined above, sampling gay and lesbian populationspresents a number of challenges to the researcher interested in exploring the experiencesof this loosely defined ideological community. Sampling of LGBT populations is difficult asit is a social group that is generally considered to be ‘hard to reach’, as noted above,‘resistant to definition’ and subject to discrimination and social isolation (Sullivan andLosberg 2003, p.148).NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research14It has been suggested that random samples of the LGBT population are impossible toobtain because no conceivable sampling frame exists for them (Martin and Knox 2000),while it has been claimed that it is impossible to obtain representative samples of theLGBT population (Heaphy et al. 1998), partly because there is no clear-cut definition ofwhat or who is LGBT. As outlined above, another reason for this is, of course, the fact thatmany LGBT people may choose not to identify themselves as such (Garnets and Kimmel1993). Research into LGBT issues has, therefore, traditionally drawn samples from members ofLGBT organisations, the readers of LGBT publications, customers of LGBT businesses andthe recipients of health and social care services (Fisher et al. 1993; Folkman et al. 1992;Hare 1994; Heaphy et al. 2003; Kurdek 1991; McFarlane 1998; Moran 1992; Paul et al.1994; Pilkington and D’Augelli 1995). As such, the generalizability of findings in studiesusing these convenience or purposive samples is limited (Martin and Knox 2000), a pointperhaps well illustrated by some of the larger scale surveys of sexual behaviour (Wellingset al. 1990; Wellings et al. 1994). Other methods used in an attempt to identify randomsamples of gay and lesbian people have, however, included complex and costly methodssuch as two-stage telephone survey designs (Blair 1999; Harry 1986) and Random DigitDialing techniques (Meyer and Colten 1999). The various challenges associated withsampling LGBT populations have resulted in research that is, perhaps, over-representativeof younger, male, urban dwelling, white, middle-class participants. McManus (2003) notes that the choice of sampling method will very much depend on thepurpose of a research project, its funding source, timeframe, and subject matter, and thatusing a variety of sampling methods may help to maximise diversity in a researchpopulation. (A criticism often levelled particularly at small-scale LGBT research studies, isthe lack of socioeconomic diversity.)Martin and Dean (1993) suggest snowballing as the sampling method of choice wherethese challenges are particularly evident. In this way, they argue, recruitment ofrespondents from diverse sources is possible in addition to personal referrals, whilerecognising that ‘the resulting sample would not be random but might include diversesegments of the gay population’ (p.85). Similarly, Biernacki and Waldorf (1981) maintainthat snowballing techniques are particularly useful when the object of enquiry isexploration and analysis, rather than the testing of predetermined hypotheses, while Lee(1993) observes that this technique is frequently used when studying topics of a sensitivenature and is often employed when respondents may be vulnerable, elusive or ‘deviant’ –all adjectives that apply to LGBT populations.Price (2008; 2010) used snowballing methods in a study that explored the care-givingexperiences of gay men and lesbian women who cared for a person with dementia. It tookfour years to recruit sufficient participants (21 people) to undertake the research and,whilst the study explored a very particular area of experience, it is an example of thetenacity and patience sometimes required to access ‘hidden’ and vulnerable populations. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research15Platzer (2006) also used snowballing methods in her study of gay men and lesbians’experiences of mental health services. This, however, was one sampling method amongst arange of innovative approaches that included the use of sponsors (key informants) andpeer researchers. Her creative methods resulted in a sample (49 people), which, she claims,was more diverse than many comparable studies. This is a study that gives an intimateinsight into the vagaries of sampling and data collection with lesbian and gay people. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN RESEARCH WITH LGBT PEOPLEIt has been suggested that conducting research with vulnerable social groups has uniqueethical and methodological requirements (Russell 1999). Equally, it is clear that someresearch questions may only be effectively addressed by recourse to work with vulnerablepeople (Moore and Miller 1999; Schafer 2001). Moore and Miller (1999) contend, however,that members of vulnerable populations often experience multiple risks that may diminishtheir autonomy, thus rendering them doubly (or indeed triply and so on) vulnerable. Thismeans that researchers may avoid working with people who may be classed as vulnerableand that, consequently, the needs and concerns of these people are not addressed withinresearch, practice and policy arenas.The ethical issues relevant to conducting research with vulnerable populations relate,primarily, to whether or not the research constitutes a risk to respondents and whether ornot they may be harmed in some way during the research process (Sieber 1992). Sieber(1992) goes on to stress that the key risks in this context are invasion of privacy, breach ofconfidentiality and embarrassment. Platzer and James (1997) further this point by arguingthat, in the context of LGBT research, the risks related to breaches of confidentiality areheightened because, for this group of people, the threats of violence, losses ofemployment, housing or children are very real. Furthermore, Martin and Knox (2000)suggest that the face-to-face research interview, which may provide less in the way ofprivacy and anonymity than other research strategies, may be particularly threatening togay and lesbian research participants.The concept of ‘vulnerability’ is, however, socially and politically contingent and, as Silva(1995) argues, the definition of a vulnerable person is broad and might be someone whoexperiences diminished autonomy due to a wide range of physiological and/orpsychological factors or status inequalities. Moore and Miller (1999) suggest that a logicalextension of this definition might include those who lack the capacity ‘to make personallife choices, to make personal decisions, to maintain independence, and to self-determine’(p.1034). As such, they argue, vulnerable people require safeguards when involved inresearch, to ensure that their rights and welfare are adequately protected. Whilst LGBT people may not be considered vulnerable in the same way as others generallytermed thus in the literature, such as children, foetuses, physically disabled people, peoplewith learning disabilities, or those who are homeless or institutionalised (Sieber 1992; SilvaNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research161995; Moore and Miller 1999), sexualities research involves working with vulnerablepopulations whose minority status is varied across a range of intersecting contexts. Therisks outlined by Platzer and James (1997) above are thus very real for many LGBT people.Walsh-Bowers and Parlour (1992) state that research with minority groups is ‘necessarilyan ethical and political intervention with participants’ and as such the researcher shouldtake specific steps to prevent harm to research participants and their environments(p.109). Indeed, from both an historical and, unfortunately, a contemporary perspective there hasbeen, and continues to be, research conducted with LGBT people that violates expectedethical standards. Work that attempts to change the sexual orientation of participants, forexample, has a long history and, it may be argued, has damaged those involved bothphysically and psychologically. Moreover, the results of unethical studies have been usedto promote stigma and prejudice against LGBT populations and as such it may benecessary to offer particularly detailed information to LGBT participants regardingassurances of confidentiality and the ways in which findings are likely to be used anddisseminated, the ways in which data will be stored (or destroyed) and the ways in whichverbatim quotations will be presented in reports and other publications. METHODSSelecting an appropriate methodology for a study rests upon a number of interrelatedfactors: the type of research question; the nature of the people under study (their varioussocial positions); the nature and potential size of the sample; resource restraints and theavailability of baseline data (McManus 2003). Questions relating to numbers – that is, how many, how much, where and so on – aremost appropriately answered by quantitative methods that allow for cost-effectivecollection of data. In contrast, questions that ask more in-depth questions – the why,wherefore and how questions – are more appropriately explored using qualitativemethods, the advocates of which argue that these approaches represent a distinctiveparadigm that should not be judged by conventional research measures such as validity,reliability and generalisability. These methods best assist with the aim of answering exploratory and descriptive researchquestions, whilst allowing for a deeper understanding of experiences and socialphenomena than that which could be obtained from a purely quantitative analysis(Maykut and Morehouse 1994; Silverman 2000, p.89). The aim of qualitative research suchas this, as noted above, is not generalisations, but rather an in-depth understanding of arange of phenomena as experienced by the research participants (Maykut and Morehouse1994). NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research17USING SURVEYSSurveys are perhaps the most commonly used quantitative research methods.Administered by post, orally (a researcher asks the questions) or electronically,standardised questionnaires are used for all respondents, with perhaps the option ofallowing respondents brief narrative passages. The UK Gay and Lesbian Census (2001), forexample, provided opportunities for narrative responses to most of its questions, althoughMcManus (2003) suggests that this approach is not unproblematic as it may be ‘off-puttingfor respondents, time consuming to complete, difficult and expensive to codify forquantitative analysis and not always kept relevant to the question’ (p. 29). This Census isparticularly interesting as it was, at the time of its publication, the largest survey of anylesbian and gay population in the world (McManus 2003) and it was predicted to be thefirst of a series of studies that would shed new light on the lives of LGBT people. Despiteconcerted efforts to access the 2001 Census and any subsequent publications, it has notbeen possible to do so and it would appear that the impetus behind the original projecthas perhaps been lost.Questions in a survey may be administered by a researcher either face to face or over thetelephone or, increasingly, by the respondent themselves in online contexts - a methodwhich McManus (2003) suggests is particularly popular with younger people. Self-completion methods may not be appropriate or successful, however, for people who haveproblems with literacy, those for whom the language used in the questionnaire is not theirfirst language and those who have visual impairments. She also notes that paper self-completion surveys often have particularly low response rates.However, some of the larger US studies that have explored the experiences of older (ormiddle aged) LGBT people have used survey methods. A study conducted by the Lesbianand Gay Aging Issues Network of the American Society on Aging (Haefele 2006) used asample of 1,000 self-identified LGBT people aged 40 to 61 years who participated in anonline survey. While the company that conducted the survey undertook measures toensure the respondent population was representative (in terms of region, race andgender), the respondent population was limited to those people who had access to theinternet and who had the inclination to undertake the work in this context. This beingsaid, however, there is evidence to suggest that the anonymity of the online environmentmay be appealing to those for whom confidentiality and anonymity are particularlyimportant. For trans people in particular, the medium may be compelling in that the‘virtual self’ offers complete anonymity and a sense of true ‘disembodiment’ (Whittle1998). As such, the online environment perhaps offers much to the researcher exploringparticularly sensitive issues with the rider that it is, of course, only available to thosepeople who are able to afford and use the required technology.Similarly, Cantor et al. (2004) surveyed 341 New York City residents aged over 50 years.Participants were recruited from more than 100 LGBT organisations and groups thatserved women and black and minority ethnic communities were specifically targeted inNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research18order to gather as diverse a sample population as possible. The study does not include ananalysis of the difficulties inherent in this approach – that those involved in LGBTorganisations are those people who are most likely to be politically active, confident andassertive about their sexuality/trans identity. In a UK context, the Beyond Barriers (2003) project surveyed 924 participants from theLGBT population in Scotland using online questionnaires and an online focus group, whilea recent Stonewall report (Hunt and Dick 2008) exploring gay and lesbian people’sexpectations of discrimination in the UK surveyed 1,658 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults.Jones (2010) uses this latter report to highlight the problems associated with the uncriticaluse of sexual categories in LGBT research, namely the various ways by which the B and theT elements of the acronym may become easily lost and therefore invisible, leaving thefocus of work on only the lesbian and gay elements of the LGBT grouping.As noted above, Serves You Right (Hunt and Dick 2008) elicited lesbian, gay and bisexualpeople’s expectations of discrimination. The methodology, although very briefly reported,states that the UK sample of 1,658 individuals was selected for participation as they hadalready identified themselves as being lesbian, gay or bisexual. However, the word‘bisexual’ appears rarely in the document, being visible only in the Introduction briefly, asstated, in the context of the methodology and once in the context of the judiciary (p.19).Other than on these occasions, bisexual people disappear from the findings and analysis.Indeed, the report’s title omits the word bisexual. (For a more complete exploration of theconcept of bisexual invisibility in health and social care contexts, see Jones 2010.)Similarly, as noted above, the US study Out and Aging: The Metlife Study of Lesbian andGay Baby Boomers (Haefele 2006) recruited 1,000 individuals who self-identified as LGB orT, but again the study’s title belies this fact. Moreover, whilst the study does provide thepercentage of the respondents who identified as bisexual or transgender (15% and 1%respectively), there is little by way of disaggregation of these various categories in theanalysis of the data.Some studies have circumnavigated the challenges associated with the use of sexualcategories by being very clear about who they do and do not include (Brotman et al. 2003;Help and Care 2006; Whittle et al. 2007). A few recent studies have, for example,concentrated solely on issues of transgender. Transgender Experiences in Scotland (ScottishTransgender Alliance/Equality Network 2008) employed both online and paper surveys toelicit the experiences of 71 trans people – the largest study in Scotland to date.Respondents were recruited by the distribution of a survey via transgender supportgroups, transgender and LGBT email news lists, and gender identity clinics. Another recent project exploring the lives of trans people, Engendered Penalties (Whittleet al. 2007), used exclusively online sources and methods. This research is, to date, themost comprehensive account of the experiences of trans people in the UK, havingaccessed 872 respondents from an online survey. The researchers also compiled anelectronic materials’ database comprising approximately 86,000 emails which were sent toNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research19Press for Change (an organization that campaigns for trans equality) from 1999 to 2005from British visitors to their website. They also accessed more than 16,000 messages to theFemale-to-Male support network from 1999 to 2006. The potential ethical issues thatmight arise when using what the contributors may perceive as private correspondencewere addressed by the researchers posting a message on the Press for Change website toinform members that the researchers were searching the online database. Those whoobjected to their messages being used as evidence could contact the researchers torequest that their data be excluded from the work.The authors are clear about the limitations of the work, including a recognition that,while using the internet to access respondents enables the researcher to recruit largenumbers of participants quickly, cheaply and confidentially, work carried out in thiscontext is limited to those people who have access to the online environment and whohave the motivation and inclination to participate in this way. There has also been a Europe-wide study by Turner et al. (2009) of trans people’sexperiences in public spaces and of the criminal justice system which, again, elicited, alarge number of responses (2669) to an online survey that was originally used to explore abroad range of issues faced by trans people, such as living arrangements, age, occupation,marital status, stage in transition, disability, employment, earnings and so on. The originalsurvey did not focus specifically on hate crimes, and as such the extrapolated data for thisstudy may be presumed not to be biased towards only those participants whosemotivation to be involved was the fact that they had experienced hate crime prior tobecoming involved in the study.QUALITATIVE METHODSWhile quantitative methods allow questions of scale to be addressed, qualitative methodsbetter assist with the aim of answering exploratory and descriptive research questions,while allowing for a deeper understanding of experiences and social phenomena thanthat which could be obtained from a purely quantitative analysis (Maykut and Morehouse1994; Silverman 2000, p.89). Advocates of qualitative methods argue that theseapproaches represent a distinctive paradigm that should not be judged by conventionalresearch measures such as validity, reliability and generalisability. They are not, however,without their own critics, the most common criticisms being that qualitative researchrepresents only an assembly of anecdotal experiences and personal impressions, that thereis a strong possibility of researcher bias and that qualitative methods are not generallyreproducible or generalisable – the gold standard of clinical research projects (Mays andPope 1995). Nonetheless, much research into issues of sexuality has employed qualitativemethods, largely using in-depth interviews and focus groups to gather rich and varieddata. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research20A notable study undertaken by Abbot and Howarth (2005) that explored the livedexperiences of LGB people with learning disabilities used semi-structured qualitativeinterview techniques. The researchers interviewed 71 staff working in learning disabilityservices in the UK about their views and experiences of working with LGB people with alearning disability. In addition, 20 LGB people with learning disabilities participated ininterviews that explored their own experiences. The third stage of the research aimed toproduce resources to assist both people who use services and staff in this area. This reportis perhaps the only one of its kind in the UK to date – there appears to be little interest inexploring LGB issues for people with learning disabilities (evidence, of course, of thepresumed asexuality of people with learning disabilities generally). The authors are atpains to point out that they approached social care services in which they knew, or at leastthought, good practice was evident with this group of people. As such, they stress that theresults are perhaps not generalisable to all service providers. Nonetheless, this remains animportant piece of work that has much to commend it as a ground-breaking study.A further important study utilising qualitative methods that explores an arguablyneglected area is Diagnosis Homophobic (McFarlane 1998). This report explored theexperiences of LGB people who had used, or were using, mental health services. Thereport built upon work already done in the context of general nursing practice whichfound endemic problems for LGB people who accessed health services (Rose and Platzer1993; Rose 1993; Platzer 1993). The study used in-depth qualitative interviews and focusgroups to elicit the views and experiences of 35 LGB people (11 gay men, 18 lesbianwomen, 3 bisexual men, 2 bisexual women). The service provider group consisted of 35workers (10 gay men, 17 lesbian women, 3 heterosexual men and 3 heterosexual women)from a wide-range of mental health service contexts. This breakdown of the sexuality ofthe practitioners is particularly interesting in that the study required participants tocomment both upon their experiences as LGB workers and, further, their knowledge ofthe experiences of LGB mental health service users. The sample thus gives a very particularshape to the nature and quality of the data. Whether this is a positive or negative featureof the work is, of course, debatable.Qualitative interviews may be semi-structured or structure-free, allowing participants todevelop their own narrative and the researcher the opportunity to explore participants’stories with them. Similarly, focus groups may be formally structured, with the facilitatorleading and directing the discussion, or have a more participant-led approach. Whicheverapproach is preferred; the researcher’s role becomes an integral part of the researchprocess and requires reflection and analysis in its own right. This point highlights animportant, but under-researched issue - there are, few studies that actually makereference to the ways in which the input of the interviewer/facilitator may have impactedupon, or driven, the research process and its outcomes. There are, therefore, few examplesin the social sciences of first-person accounts from either ‘non-native or native’ (those whodo or do not belong to the social group under study) researchers about the experience ofconducting research (Kanuha 2000). This has resulted in a lack of acknowledgementNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research21regarding the potential strengths and pitfalls relating to the insider perspective in socialresearch. In LGBT research, however, consideration given to these issues at a study’s outsetmay preclude methodological problems that occur later in the research process. There are conflicting arguments about the importance of ‘insider status’ in LGBT research.It has been suggested that researchers who study populations, cultures, communities orsocial identity groups of which they are a member bring privileged knowledge andunderstanding to their research that may, in turn, facilitate the collection of data andtheir subsequent analysis (LaSala 2003, p.15). Conversely, this knowledge also has thepotential to bias the research process as the researcher may ‘fail to notice what is uniqueand informative about their own group or culture’ (LaSala 2003, p.19). Bridges (2001)furthers this point to suggest that insider accounts of communities’ experiences should betreated with scepticism as they can be ‘riddled with special pleading, selective memory,careless error, self-centredness, myopia, prejudice, and a good deal more’ (p.373),arguments that could, of course, be levelled equally at the outsider researcherapproaching an unfamiliar community with a lack of appropriate ethical consideration,respect or care. As noted above, few studies give analytical credence to insider status or,indeed, the ways in which it may be possible for non-LGBT researchers to bias data in oneway or another. One of the few, however, is a study by Bytheway et al. (2007) whichexplored participants’ (of all sexualities) ageing experiences. This study made efforts tomatch the gender and sexuality of participants and researchers where possible. The reportdoes not, however, report on the effects this approach might have had on the datacollected. Fine (1994) warns insider researchers against the risk of romanticising narratives andconcomitantly retreating from analysis and, with the best of ethical and moral intentions,attempting to speak for their own social identity groups. There are also those whosuggest that the insider-outsider debates in social research should be abandoned due tothe multiplicity of subjectivities assumed by both researcher and researched during theresearch process (Narayan 1993). To conclude this section, a note must be made of a rarely used method in adult social careresearch - the use of diaries to elicit and record individuals’ lived experiences. While herwork does not relate specifically to adult social care, Kenten (2010) reflects upon the useof solicited diaries (research-driven diaries), providing useful insights into this method andits various advantages and limitations in a piece of work that explored lesbians’ and gaymen’s sexualities. She suggests that the method is attractive, as the diary is a familiar andcommon method of recording personal narrative, reflection and analysis, and provides acredible link between the private and public worlds of respondents. The limitations of thismethod include, however, the sometimes considerable time commitment and the requisiteliteracy skills required to complete diary entries. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research22PARTICIPATIVE RESEARCHParticipatory research aims to overcome some of the methodological barriers that presentthemselves between researchers and minority or oppressed populations. The method isparticularly concerned to avoid the power imbalances that may occur with moretraditional methods whereby an ‘expert’ defines a problem to be investigated andexplores it, perhaps without reference to the people or group/s who actually experiencethe problem, thus extracting the issue from its social and cultural context. It is a methodwhich claims to be ‘a genuinely democratic or non-coercive process whereby those to behelped determine the purposes and outcomes of their own inquiry’ (Wadsworth 1998).Work within the voluntary sector, in particular, has employed participatory methods andhas been driven by consultation and close involvement of LGBT people (Archibald 2010). A study exploring the social care needs of older lesbians and gay men was undertaken inLiverpool (Kitchen 2003). This research was commissioned by Sefton Pensioners’ AdvocacyCentre (SPAC) and Merseyside Gay and Lesbian Community Forum. The aim of the work,the author states, was to:...genuinely build bridges between communities, we need to be positive bothabout the gay and lesbian community and older people. An important element ofthis research will be seeking out the views of older gay men and lesbiansthemselves.The challenges of recruiting LGBT people (particularly older people) for research projectsare clearly elucidated in the report which, whilst producing useful insights into the worldsof older gay and lesbian people in a very small geographical area, had a limited budgetand timeframe and was limited by involvement from a very small participant group (fivepeople). A notable study, undertaken solely by a group of older people living in the Isle of Thanet,Opening Doors in Thanet (2003), surveyed the extent of sheltered housing services andcare home providers’ awareness regarding the needs of older LGBT people in these livingcontexts. The group, comprising gay, lesbian and heterosexual older people, took advicefrom Age Concern England and local Development Workers in compiling thequestionnaire which covered a range of issues. The approach was first to elicit whetherproviders felt they had any LGBT service users (many of whom said they did not, despitethe report’s prediction that 5% of users were likely to be LGBT), and then to ask questionsthat explored the depth of understanding of LGBT people’s needs, including whether ornot providers included issues of sexuality in their equal opportunities policies. The groupsent out 149 questionnaires (with a stamped addressed envelope to facilitate replies),though the number of responses (11 out of 121, or an 18% response rate) wasdisappointing. While the report explored a very small geographical area and surveyed asmall number of service providers, it was, perhaps, the first piece of research in the UK totry to find out how service providers perceived LGBT people’s needs or if, indeed,NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research23providers had given any thought to the fact that these needs and expectations may bedifferent from those of heterosexual people. Again, the report does not disaggregate thedifferences between LGBT categories or identities; rather it provides a broad exploratorylens for the views of service providers.It was followed some years later by a similarly locally based initiative, Lifting the Lid onSexuality and Ageing (Help and Care 2006). The research was a joint venture between theInstitute of Health and Community Studies at Bournemouth University and Help and Care,a charity working across the South coast of England. This was the first project in the UK toamass a sizeable sample of older LGBT people. The purpose of the research project was tobroadly examine the experiences and needs of older lesbians and gay men in theBournemouth, Poole and Dorset area (receiving 91 questionnaires and completing 30 in-depth interviews).The research report explores, in some detail, the variety of ways in which a participatorymethodology was put into practice in this study. Ward et al. (2008) offer a criticalcomparative review of this work, whilst another participative study, the Polari inPartnership Project (Davies and River 2006), explores the challenges associated withworking in a participative context. Count Me In (Mind 2000) was another participative project, which came about via acollaboration of LGBT groups in the East Sussex area. The research involved analysis of theresponses to a self-completion questionnaire by 1158 participants. The project furtheredthe participative element of the work by facilitating a community feedback event, whichenabled people to respond to the study’s findings. This work has been the impetus behinda range of research initiatives carried out in Brighton, described as the UK’s ‘Gay Capital’.The work carried out by the ‘Count Me in Too’ team is an example of participatoryresearch that works in partnership with LGBT stakeholders. Its website(http://www.countmeintoo.co.uk/) contains a wealth of useful information (including, onrequest, access to the project team’s data and other LGBT research) for researchersinterested in exploring LGBT issues. Unusually, it also disaggregates data on trans andbisexual people from that which relates to lesbians and gay men, in addition to data on afurther sub-sample of the LGBT population – people who are deaf.A further example of research, this time undertaken for a regulatory consultation thatwas driven by the ethics of participation, and of particular note in the context of thisreview, was undertaken as part of the consultation Living Well in Later Life (HealthcareCommission 2006). This project, which was a review of progress against the NationalService Framework for Older People, was notable because it acknowledged (for, perhaps,the first time in a major UK-wide study by the regulators) that the needs, expectations andexperiences of LGBT people (in this context, older people) may be different from those ofthe heterosexual population. Following this, Bytheway et al. (2007) in Too Old: Older People’s Accounts ofDiscrimination, Exclusion and Rejection also included the perspectives of lesbians and gayNIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research24men. This report provides more detail than the Healthcare Commission report in that itspecifies the ways in which the study’s methods were geared specifically towards thosewho were not heterosexual.MIXED METHODSThe studies described above are examples of mixed methods designs in which ‘theresearcher mixes or combines quantitative and qualitative research techniques, methods,approaches, concepts or language into a single study’ (Burke Johnson and Onwuengbuzie2004, p.17). The advantage of mixed methods is that, for areas of study where there islittle contemporaneous research, such as the LGBT arena, a range of complementarymethods allows for the development of a ‘more reliable baseline picture’ (McManus 2003,p.32). Mixed methods have other methodological advantages. McManus (2003) refers to astudy by Gadd et al. (2002), for example, in which the combination of methods enabledthe flaws in one method to be addressed in the other/s. As noted above, many researchstudies that focus on the lives of LGBT people have employed mixed methods designs. Thestudy by Keogh et al. (2006), for example, used an online quantitative questionnaire toelicit the social care needs of LGBT people in Lambeth, their knowledge and experienceof, and participation in, local services and their concerns regarding council-run services. Sixsubsequent focus groups were facilitated, in which participants were able to explorefurther the themes identified in the questionnaire responses. Heaphy et al. (2003) also employed a mixed method design, the quantitative element ofwhich allowed the researchers to ‘capture the range of experience across the sample’,whilst the ‘qualitative aspect was integrated throughout the research process andprovided depth’ (p.6). This report goes into some detail about the difficulties inidentifying participants from older age groups in LGBT research – a common problem instudies of this kind. Indeed, in many reports of the experiences of older LGBT people,older people are often conspicuous by their absence. Berger’s (1984) seminal study, forexample, referred to those over 50 as ‘older people’. Hubbard and Rossington (1995),however, managed to recruit a third of their respondents (45) between the ages of 60 and70 plus. This study also used a mixed methods design, having a questionnaire, in-depthinterviews with both people who use services and providers, and a series of publicmeetings. Given that the work was pioneering, the relatively large sample of lesbian andgay people who participated (131 people returned the questionnaire) was particularlynotable. This study, As We Grow Older, commissioned by Polari (a lesbian and gayorganisation), was one of the first in the UK to address the specific housing and social careneeds of lesbian and gay people. NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research25CONCLUSIONThis review is an attempt to enable researchers to think about the ways in which LGBTidentities impact upon the methodological decisions taken in a research project. As statedin the introduction, LGBT people will already participate in much, if not all, social careresearch – the challenge for the researcher is to allow these voices expression. It isrecognised, of course, that giving each and every discrete factor outlined in this reviewfull consideration would, perhaps, mean that the research became infeasible. The factremains, however, that conflating people’s differences without recourse to someconsideration of the issues outlined here is likely to produce misleading and simplisticfindings and conclusions (Sullivan and Losberg 2003). Account, therefore, needs to be taken of the issues outlined earlier. The challengesassociated with both counting and sampling LGBT populations, the problematic issues ofdefinition and categorisation, the language used to describe LGBT people and the ethicalconcerns that should be addressed with this, or any, vulnerable population may beovercome by a willingness to include the perspectives of LGBT people. These issues andthe research questions being asked will be the impetus behind the choice of methods inany given research project. As noted earlier, whilst qualitative methods have traditionally been the choice for researchthat explores hidden or particularly vulnerable populations, for LGBT research, mixedmethods have proved a useful way of, first, providing a broad understanding of particularissues and, second, more in-depth analysis of participants’ experiences. Similarly, participative methods, whilst presenting numerous methodological challenges,allow for a degree of ownership of research that has historically been used only tooppress. These methods are one way to address the fears LGBT people may haveregarding the collection of data and the use of findings in social care research.To conclude, social care research with and including LGBT people should have as one of itsprimary aims the facilitation of the often-silenced voices of LGBT populations to ensure, atthe very least, that legislation, social policy and social care and health services areprovided on a fair and equal basis for all members of the community.NIHR School for Social Care Research Methods ReviewLGBT sexualities in social care research26REFERENCESAbbot D, Haworth J (2005) Secret Loves, Hidden Lives?

    "abstract": "People who transgress expected norms regarding gender and sexuality have always attracted attention from social scientists. Early sexuality research, in which sexualities that differed from the statistical norm were presented as perversion, travesty, sickness and sin, has, for the most part, yielded to a contemporary focus that explores the lived experiences and realities of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. This body of work has been underpinned by sometimes competing social and political objectives and, as such, has employed a variety of research methods and methodologies. Some recent research has focused on the adult social care arena – the ways in which the needs of LGBT people are acknowledged, recognised and addressed in social care contexts. It is from this particular perspective that this review is written. The review charts the development of sexualities research and provides an overview of associated methodological approaches and perspectives, particularly those that have a specific adult social care focus. A range of examples from the various approaches is provided. The review includes a critical appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the various approaches. It addresses a range of methodological challenges associated with research with LGBT people, including the ethical context of research with vulnerable populations, the concept of ‘insider status’ and some of the problems associated with the use of uncritical definitions and measurements of sexual minorities and how these may be addressed in research that aims to be inclusive without running the risk of tokenism. The aim of the review is to enable researchers, articularly those working in the field of adult social care, to recognize and acknowledge the diversity of human experience in their own work, the ultimate objective being to improve social care practice",
