Executive SummaryThe Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH) estimates that over the course of a year,approximately 26,000 youth in Illinois experience homelessness.  This is slightly more thanreported in a 1985 state-funded study.  Homeless youth are between the ages of 14 and 21, haveleft home because of serious family problems, and are not in a safe and stable living situation.Youth that experience homelessness are likely to experience abuse and neglect both before andafter becoming homeless.We estimate that forty-five percent, or approximately 12,000, of these youth have chronichomeless experiences.  Youth in this category live outside and in other public places forprolonged periods, face sometimes insurmountable obstacles to returning home, and have anespecially high likelihood of being abused and victimized while they are homeless.Available housing resources for homeless youth do not come close to meeting the need for theseservices.  A CCH survey found that 42 percent of youth seeking shelter from state-fundedHomeless Youth programs were turned away last year due to lack of resources.  Eighty-eightpercent of state-funded crisis intervention programs for youth responded that they needadditional residential resources for homeless youth.Abuse (physical, emotional, and/or sexual), substance abuse by a parent, absence of a parent, andlong-term family economic problems are all common family experiences among youth thatexperience homelessness.  Pregnant and parenting teens, former and current wards, and youthwho identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or questioning (LGBTQ) account for ahighly disproportionate segment of the population of homeless youth.Homeless youth, particularly those with chronic experiences, have a difficulty meeting theirbasic needs, as well as a high likelihood for physical and sexual victimization, engaging insubstance abuse, engaging in unprotected sexual activity, and delinquency.  Many are notenrolled in or regularly attending school, and these youth have limited access to services for theirphysical and emotional health care needs.Due to a 1999 increase in funding for programs serving homeless youth, however, the State ofIllinois has made some progress in recent years with regard to providing shelter and supportiveservices for this vulnerable population.  For example, in fiscal year 2000 IDHS spent $4.17million on programs specifically for homeless youth and served 2,105 youth.  In 1996, when thestate spent half as much on these programs, only 986 youth were served.  Between 1986, whenthe state started funding programs for homeless youth, and 1994 the state only spent about $1million annually for these programs.We recommend that the State of Illinois increase expenditures for emergency, transitional, andlong-term supportive housing for currently homeless youth, in order to assist these youth inbecoming self-sufficient, productive adults.  We also recommend that more resources be put intothe prevention of youth homelessness through early intervention with at-risk families.  Finally,we call for the expansion and implementation of policies that promote the long-term economicand social stability of families.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 3II. Introduction and Major FindingsThe Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH) estimates that over the course of a yearapproximately 26,000 youth in Illinois experience homelessness.  Homeless youth are betweenthe ages of 14 and 21, have left home because of serious family problems, and are not in a safeand stable living situation.Youth who have “run away” and have been “thrown away” are both included in this definition.The living situations of youth experiencing homelessness include “couch surfing” (movingbetween friends, family and acquaintances), staying in shelters, and/or living outside or in publicplaces.We estimate that forty-five percent, or approximately 12,000, of all youth that experiencehomelessness have chronic homeless experiences.  Youth with chronic homeless experiences aremore likely to live for prolonged periods in public places (e.g., abandoned buildings, parks, or onthe street).  They have a higher likelihood than homeless youth in general of being abused andvictimized.  The obstacles they face to being reunited with their families are sometimesinsurmountable.  In many cases returning to one’s family is not an appropriate option.Based on CCH surveys of service providers who work with homeless youth around the state anddata provided by the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) we can now report that:Ø Available housing resources for homeless youth do not come close to meeting the need forthese services.  We estimate that forty-two percent of youth, or about 1,500 youth, seekingshelter from IDHS-funded Homeless Youth programs were turned away during fiscal year2000 due to lack of resources.  Most of these turnaways occurred in Chicago.Ø Due to a 1999 increase in funding for Homeless Youth programs serving homeless youth,however, the State of Illinois has made some progress in recent years with regard toproviding shelter and supportive services for this vulnerable population.  For example, infiscal year 2000 IDHS spent $4.17 million on programs specifically for homeless youth andserved 2,105 youth.  In 1996, when the state spent half as much on these programs, only 986youth were served.  Between 1986, when the state started funding programs for homelessyouth, and 1994 the state only spent about $1 million annually for these programs.Ø CCBYS is an IDHS-funded, statewide program that provides crisis intervention services forminors who are at risk of involvement in the child welfare and/or juvenile justice system,including youth who are homeless and at-risk of homelessness.  Eighty-eight percent ofComprehensive Community Based Youth Services (CCBYS) programs report that they needadditional resources for residential placements for youth in need of housing.Prior to this report, the most recent population estimate of the number of youth that experiencehomelessness in Illinois each year was completed in 1985 by the Governor’s Task Force onHomeless Youth.  Using a substantially similar method (see Appendix A), the task forceestimated that 21,535 youth experienced homelessness over the course of a year.  The 1985estimate and the 2001 estimate are close enough to conclude that the number of youth whoYouth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 4experience homelessness in Illinois annually has gone essentially unchanged during the past 16years.In this report, unlike the 1985 estimate, we draw a distinction between youth who haveexperienced homelessness of any duration and youth who have had a chronic, or more seriousand prolonged, experience of homelessness.  We can draw this distinction because of themethodology used to reach our population estimate.  A large part of the population estimate isbased on estimating the number of youth who do not come into contact with any social servicesystem.  To make this estimate, we use statistics from a national survey by the U.S. Dept ofHealth and Human Services completed in 1995.iThe federal survey asked youth whether they had experienced homelessness and whether theyhad made use of a shelter.  There was a large difference in the number of youth who had notaccessed shelter depending on whether the youth was currently on the street or in the generalpopulation of youth in the United States.  Only 25% of youth in the general population who hadhad a homeless experience used a shelter, whereas 54% of youth on the street had used a shelter.Because of the large difference in the figure, we can assume that youth in the general populationwho experienced homelessness would include a broad range of experiences — from beingwithout a place to stay for one night to being chronically homeless.  The street sample of youth,by contrast, most likely represents a population of youth who have had more chronicexperiences.  Therefore, the larger figure we estimate — 26,000 homeless youth in Illinois —represents a broad range of experiences of homelessness.  The smaller figure we estimate —12,000 youth with chronic experiences — represents a narrower definition that is more likely toinclude a longer period of homelessness with time spent on the street.The Stories Behind the NumbersThe data and research presented in this report tell an incomplete story about youth homelessness.A more complete picture must include the stories of youth who experience homelessness.  Whilestories vary, what each youth shares is a need for stable housing and a supportive environment.Throughout this report we provide a few stories of youth who are moving successfully fromyouth into adulthood and youth still struggling with homelessness.  The names of the youthwhose stories we share have been changed.  These stories were told to us by service providersand by youth themselves.III. Method for Determining Population EstimateThe estimate that approximately 26,000 youth experience homelessness each year in Illinois(26,619 exactly according to our method) was determined by determining the size of thefollowing populations:Ø The number of youth served by Homeless Youth programs funded by the Illinois Departmentof Human Services (IDHS) during fiscal year 2000.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 5Ø The number of youth who sought services but were turned away by IDHS Homeless Youthprograms due to the lack of program resources during fiscal year 2000.  This figure wasestimated based on a survey of these programs conducted by CCH.Ø The number of youth served by Homeless Youth programs providing residential services thatwere not funded by the Illinois Department of Human Services during fiscal year 2000.Ø The number of youth served by IDHS-funded Comprehensive Community Based YouthServices (CCBYS) programs who experience homelessness and were not served by, and didnot seek services from, IDHS-funded Homeless Youth programs during fiscal year 2000.Ø The number of 18 to 21 year olds in adult shelters in Illinois during fiscal year 2000.Ø The number of youth who experience homelessness, but never come into contact with thesocial service system.  This number is based on 1995 national study sponsored by the Familyand Youth Service Bureau of the United Sates Department of Health and Human Services.iiThe study found that only 25 percent youth with homeless experiences make use of youth oradult shelters.Ø The number of youth with chronic homeless experiences (12,077 youth) was based on a 54percent shelter utilization rate of youth living in public places, or “street youth”, asdetermined by a survey of street youth for the federal study previously cited.Unless otherwise noted, the source of all data was the Illinois Department of Human Services.More specific information regarding the methods used for determining the population figure canbe found in Appendix A.  Results of the population estimate are shown in Table 1.Table 1 — Population Estimate For the Number of Youth who ExperienceHomelessness in Illinois over the Course of a YearPopulation Numberof YouthYouth served by IDHS funded Homeless Youth programs 2,105Youth denied services by IDHS funded Homeless Youth programs due to lack of resources1,500Youth served by Homeless Youth programs not funded by IDHS 307Youth served by Comprehensive Community Based Youth Services (CCBYS) programs whoexperience homelessness and are not served by, or seek services from, Homeless Youth programs654Youths who are 18 to 21 year old and stayed in adult shelters in Illinois 1,956Subtotal 6,522Youth that experience homelessness who never come into contact with the social service system19,929Youth who experience homelessness over the course of a year in Illinois 26,396Youth with chronic homeless experiences who never come into contact with the social servicesystem5,556Youth that have a chronic homelessness experience over the course of a year in Illinois 12,077Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 6IV. Family Background And Homeless ExperiencesFamily experiences of homeless youthAny youth who lacks a stable living situation, whether on the street or “doubled-up,” ishomeless.  A differentiation has often has been made between youth who “run away” and thosewho are “thrown away,” but both groups lack stable housing.Homeless youth are not isolated in one geographic area or to a certain social class, race, orethnicity.  Because of the city’s size, numerically most of Illinois’ homeless youth are to befound in Chicago.  However, data suggests that on a per capita basis youth homelessness isequally prevalent in places such as Rockford, Peoria, Aurora, Springfield, Champaign, East St.Louis, and Marion.iiiResearch about youth homelessness in general has shown that the great majority of homelessyouth come from families suffering from instability.iv  A 1992 national survey of serviceproviders identified the range of problems that youth experienced prior to becoming homeless.vLong-term family economic problems were among the most prevalent problems, as wereinvolvement in the foster care system, absence of a parent, abuse (physical, emotional, and/orsexual), and substance abuse by a parent.Pregnant and parenting teens, former and current wards, and youth who identify as lesbian, gay,bisexual, transgendered, or questioning (LGBTQ) have a highly disproportionate representationin the population of homeless youth. (See the sections, “At High Risk for Homelessness,” below.)Little research has been completed to determine which factors lead to youth having what wedefine as “chronic” homeless experiences” compared to youth with less severe experiences.   Wecan expect that the life experiences of youth with chronic experiences are worse.Experiences while homelessYouth who have experienced homelessness have difficulty meeting their basic needs, as well as ahigh likelihood for physical and sexual victimization. Interviews conducted with almost 200youth by CCH for Alone after Dark: A Survey of Homeless Youth in Chicago found that 33percent of the youth had been physically attacked, 20 percent had been raped or sexuallyassaulted after leaving home, and 12 percent had engaged in prostitution.vi Studies of nationalsamples of homeless youth and surveys in other urban report have similar findings regardingphysical and sexual victimization.As one can imagine, when basic survival is a challenge, it is difficult for homeless youth to stayin school.  For homeless youth, problems in school often mean that they will leave school andnot return.  A 1999 study of homeless youth in four Midwestern cities found that 42 percent ofthe boys and 32 percent of the girls had dropped out of school.viiYouth experiencing homelessness are also at high-risk of carrying weapons and engaging incriminal activities.  In Alone after Dark, almost one-third of the youth interviewed reportedYouth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 7carrying a weapon to protect themselves.  Eight percent of the youth interviewed reporteddealing drugs and 9 percent reported that they had stolen to meet basic survival needs. Theseself-reports likely greatly underestimate the actual prevalence of these occurrences.Youth that experience homelessness are also at high-risk for substance abuse.  In Alo e afterDark, one-third of the youth interviewed reported symptoms of alcoholism, such as notremembering the events of the previous night.  These youth often first come into contact withpeople engaging in substance abuse within their families before they leave home.  The 1992national survey of service providers found that among homeless youth, 29 percent had analcoholic parent and 24 percent had a drug-abusing parent.viiiYouth that experience homelessness also have a high risk of engaging in unprotected sexualbehavior. Nine percent of youth survey for Alone after Dark eported having sex withintravenous drug users and ten percent reported having unprotected sex.Homeless adolescents often suffer from severe anxiety and depression, poor health and nutrition,and low self-esteem. In one study, the rates of major depression, conduct disorder, and post-traumatic stress syndrome were found to be 3 times as high among runaway youth as amongyouth who have not run away.ix Eighteen percent of youth survey for Alone after Dark eportedhaving attempted suicide.  Homeless youth are at a greater risk of contracting AIDS or HIV-related illnesses — as much as 2 to 10 times higher than the rates reported for other samples ofadolescents in the United States.x  However, few health care and mental health care resources areavailable for homeless youth, particularly minors who cannot legally consent to most services.The Stories Behind the NumbersCaroline, 21 years old, first experienced homelessness when she was 13.  While living with herfather she was physically abused.  She could not live with her mother because of her mother’sdrug addiction.  She was made a ward of the state, but never was provided with a permanentplacement.  After falling out of foster care, she spent time a lot of time in shelters and on thestreets, developing her own drug addiction, and having three children.  Eventually, at 19 shefound employment and got off drugs.  She was stable for almost two years.  However, she  wasrecently laid off from her job.  Since then she has been moving from friend to friend, caring forher own children, and uncertain of her future.V. At High Risk for Homelessness: Pregnant and Parenting TeensYouth who are parents make up an ever-growing part of the homeless youth population.  In a1996 survey of Illinois homeless youth providers, 30 percent identified services for pregnant andparenting teens as their greatest unmet need.  Nationally, homelessness among families withchildren has been increasing.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors’ report on Hunger andHomelessness released in 2000 reports that 72 percent of cities surveyed had an increase inshelter requests from families.  Among all cities in 2000, the demand increased by 17 percent.xiYouth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 8Why are pregnant and parenting teens more likely to become homeless than single youth?Pregnant and parenting teens often face difficulties with their families due to their pregnancy.  Inmany cases, families that are already facing overcrowding cannot make room for another child inthe house, thereby forcing the teen mom to move out.  In other cases, conflict arises over the teenparent's choice of partner or simply over the pregnancy itself.Domestic violence is another factor contributing to homelessness of pregnant and parentingteens.  According to a 2000 study by the Center for Impact Research, 55 percent of low-incometeen mothers receiving welfare in Chicago had been abused by their boyfriends in the past 12months (474 teens were interviewed).  Many teen mothers are living with their boyfriends andbecome homeless when trying to escape abuse.  In a pilot program to address the level ofdomestic violence experienced by teen mothers in the south suburbs of Chicago, the mostimportant resource gap identified by service providers was housing, both temporary andpermanent. xiiAccording to the Ounce of Prevention Fund, childhood sexual abuse increases the likelihood thatteens will become pregnant.  That 15 percent of homeless youth have been sexually assaulted bytheir parents, suggests there is a correlation between teen homelessness and teen pregnancy.xiiiWhat can be done to prevent homelessness among pregnant and parenting teens?Ø Support educational programs to prevent teen dating violence.Ø Support increased access to education around family planning and birth control optionsØ Support increased funding for housing programs for homeless teen parents and teen parentsexperiencing domestic violence.The Stories Behind the NumbersDave first came into contact with the YMCA Network in Alsip when he was 16 after beingkicked out his parent’s house.  Initially staying with friends and trying to go back home, Daveeventually found himself sleeping behind dumpsters and in south suburban forest preserves.  Atthe YMCA Network, he was able to reside in one of the 20 scattered-site apartments that theagency leases which provided the structure and support necessary for his success.  At 22, Davewas in technical college and planning a career in computers.VI. At High Risk for Homelessness: WardsResearch conducted across the country has consistently shown that youth who \"age-out\" or whoare emancipated from the foster care system often lack the independent living skills and thepersonal support networks that are necessary in order to establish and maintain a household.Moreover, many youth in the child welfare system flee their foster care placements while stillwards of the state.  Example of research on this issue include:Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 9Ø In Alone after Dark: A Survey of Homeless Youth in Chicago, the Chicago Coalition for theHomeless found that 44 percent of the youths surveyed had been wards.Ø A federal study of former foster care wards found that one-fourth had experiencedhomelessness after being in the child welfare system.xivØ As many as 56 percent of the youth in the foster care system reported having run away froma foster care placement, on average as many as 5 different times.xvWhy are wards more likely to become homeless than non-wards?It has not been shown that foster care causes homelessness.  Rather, it seems that the sort ofexperiences that lead to one being placed in foster care are the same sorts of experiences that canlead a youth to become homeless.  These experiences include physical and sexual abuse, parentswith substance abuse problems, and the absence of a parent.  However, while the foster caresystem is set up to remove youth from the harm they face in their families, the system has nothistorically been designed, or been given the resources, to ensure that youth in foster care will beable to live self-sufficient, productive lives as adults.What can be done to prevent homelessness among wards?Ø Implement prevention programs that keep children out of the foster care system.  Forexample, voluntary home visiting programs that build stronger families and develop healthierchildren.Ø Once children are in the foster care system, family reunification or adoption should be apriority.  Illinois is making some progress in this area.  In 2000, the Department of Childrenand Family Services (DCFS) arranged for the adoption of 7,040 children (an 83 percentincrease from 1998) and placed 1,500 foster children with legal guardians (an 800 percentincrease from 1997).xviØ Provide support services for youth who “age out” of the system, such as employment andeducation assistance, and housing subsidies.VII. At High Risk for Homelessness: LBGTQ YouthYouth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or questioning (LGBTQ) make up adisproportionate percentage of youth who experience homelessness.  In Houston, Los Angeles,and New York City, for example, studies of homeless youth living on the street have found thatbetween 16 percent and 38 percent identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual.   Commonly citedfigures estimate that 10 percent of the adult population identifies as gay or lesbian.Why are LGBTQ youth more likely to become homeless than heterosexual youth?Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 10Ø LGBTQ youth are more likely than heterosexual youth to experience persistent conflict andharassment at home, school and elsewhere.  These experiences are associated withhomelessness. One study showed that 80 percent of LBGTQ experienced verbal abuse, and41 percent had been victimized by violence.xviiØ Many studies suggest that LGBTQ youth are at greater risk for experiencing violence athome, depression, suicide, and alcohol and drug abuse — all risk factors for homelessness.Ø LBGTQ youth are often forced to leave home due to family conflicts over their sexualorientation. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reports that that 26 percent of gaymales are forced to leave home because of conflicts over their sexual identify.xviiiØ According to Human Rights Watch, harassment based on sexual orientation and genderidentity in the public schools affects as many as two million students nationwide.xixWhat can be done to prevent homelessness among LGBTQ youth?Ø Support legislation and school district policies that explicitly prohibit harassment anddiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Ø LGBTQ youth often lack safe spaces in which to come into contact with people who arenonjudgmental and non-threatening in regards to sexual orientation and gender identity.  Safespaces do not have to be solely focused on issues of sexual identity, but they must have anenvironment where homophobia is not tolerated and a youth knows that he or she can receivesupport when he or she needs it.  Safe spaces can be in a family, among friends, in a church,a youth center, or an outreach program for LGBTQ youth.Ø Support funding for programs that serve LGBTQ youth and other youth experiencinghomelessness.The Stories Behind the NumbersSherry, 18 years old, was referred to the Springfield’s Youth Service Bureau (YSB) after hermother died and she had no place to go with her 16 year-old sister.  Honoring here mother’swishes, Sherry took custody of her sister, so Sherry did.  Sherry was able to remain in hermother’s home, with the help of rent assistance and other financial aid through YSB, and hersister was able to continue school.  While working with YSB, Sherry became a nursing assistantand now works at a nursing home.  She is in the process of getting financial aid to go to nursingschool.VIII. Resources Currently Available for Homeless YouthAvailable housing resources for homeless youth do not come close to meeting the need for theseservices.  State government, through the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS), fundsmost existing programs that address the needs of homeless youth.  The federal government fundsYouth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 11Runaway and Homeless Youth programs through the Department of Health and HumanServices, but in Illinois this funding stream goes almost exclusively to programs that are state-funded.  There are a handful of programs with other funding sources.According to a survey of IDHS-funded Homeless youth programs conducted by CCH, 42 percentof youth seeking shelter from IDHS-funded Homeless Youth programs were turned away duringfiscal year 2000 due to lack of resources.  Most of these turnaways occurred in Chicago. Overall,IDHS-funded Homeless Youth programs served only 8 percent of the total population ofhomeless youth.Due to a 1999 increase in funding for Homeless Youth programs, however, the State of Illinoishas made some progress in recent years with regard to providing shelter and supportive servicesfor this vulnerable population. These programs include those that provide emergency shelter forup to 120 days, transitional residential programs that last for up to two years, independent livingprograms, drop-in centers, and street outreach programs.  For example, in fiscal year 2000 IDHSspent $4.17 million on programs specifically for homeless youth and served 2,105 youth.  In1996, when the state spent half as much on these programs, only 986 youth were served.Between 1986, when the state started funding Homeless Youth programs, and 1994 the state onlyspent about $1 million annually for these programs.Another way that homeless youth are served by the state is through Comprehensive Community-Based Youth Services (CCBYS) programs.  CCBYS is a statewide program serving youth aged10 to 17 who are at risk of involvement in the child welfare and/or juvenile justice system,including youth at-risk of homelessness.  In fiscal year 2000, IDHS funded 74 CCBYS grantees.During that year, CCBYS programs served 12,722 youth.  CCBYS programs attempt to reunifyyouth with their families and, when necessary, secure shelter and social services for youth.Based on a survey of CCBYS agencies by CCH, 9 percent of the 12,722 youth served statewideduring fiscal year 2000 met the definition of homeless used in this report, as they were not in asafe and stable living situation and are were not living with a parent or guardian when they firstcame into contact with the CCBYS program.  Fifteen percent of the youth were in need of aresidential placement for at least one night.  For residential placements, CCBYS agenciesreported using licensed foster parents, youth shelters, motels, juvenile detention centers, andgroup homes.  However, eighty-eight percent of respondents reported that they need additionalresources for the residential placement of youth.IX. Comparing the 1985 and 2001 Population EstimatesPrior to this report, the most recent population estimate of the number of youth that experiencehomelessness in Illinois each year was completed in 1985 by the Governor’s Task Force onHomeless Youth.  Using a substantially similar method (see Appendix A), the task forceestimated that 21,535 youth experienced homelessness during that year.  The 1985 estimate andthe 2001 estimate are close enough to conclude that the number of youth who experiencehomelessness in Illinois annually has gone essentially unchanged during the past 16 years.According to census figures, both the 1985 and 2001 homeless youth population estimatesYouth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 12represent slightly less than 2 percent of the total population of 14 to 21 year-olds in eachrespective year.xxThat the number of youth that experience homelessness each year in Illinois in 2001 is about thesame as in 1985 may be surprising to some.  During the last few years welfare caseloads andchild poverty rates in Illinois have decreased, as have the number of youth in substitute care.Teen birth rates are down and high school graduation rates are up.xxiThe following points provide possible explanations as to why the number of youth experiencinghomelessness has remained stable.Ø Important causes of youth homelessness, such as the incidence of absence of a parent, abuse(physical, emotional, and/or sexual) by a parent or guardian, and substance abuse by a parent,and discrimination and harassment of LGBTQ youth are not adequately measured bycommon indicators of economic and social well being.Ø Youth who become homeless represent youth from families with the most complex anddifficult problems in our society — families that are not impacted by the marginalimprovements in certain measurements of economic and social well-being that have beenrealized over the last few years.Ø According to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), decreases inthe number of youth in substitute care were primarily realized by moving children out of thefoster care system and into permanent homes, primarily through adoption.xxii  Bec use thegreat majority of youth who become homeless are older adolescents, and many are over 18,adoption is not a realistic option for this population.Ø To the extent that economic well being is a factor contributing to youth homelessness,poverty rates do not accurately reflect the costs of maintaining a home, and in turn, theeconomic well being of families.  A 2001 report by the Economic Policy Institute, Hardshipsin America: The Real Story of Working Families, found that “poverty line” income is notsufficient to support most working families.  For example, for a two-parent two-child familythe poverty line is $17,643.  The researchers found that the income necessary to pay for asafe and decent standard of living for the same size family in the Chicago metropolitan areais $39,464 annually.  In rural areas, families of this size need $33,075 to meet the basicfamily budget.Ø Decreases in the number of families receiving welfare does not mean that families whoformerly received welfare, or who are no longer eligible for welfare, have improved theirstandard of living overall.  A 2000 study by the Illinois’ Work, Welfare, and Familiescoalition, Living with Welfare Reform: A Survey of Low-Income Families in Illinois, assessedthe effects of welfare reform on low-income persons across Illinois.  The study found that 64percent of former TANF recipients who left TANF for work were living at annual incomesbelow the federal poverty level for their family size.  They also found that many TANFclients reported having being cut from benefits to which they remained entitled.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 13The Stories Behind the NumbersSusan, 19 years old, came from a suburban Chicago family with a history of drug abuse anddeveloped her own heroin addiction in her early teens.  She became homeless soon after.  Manyof the youth she first knew while homeless are still using drugs, are involved in prostitution, orhave disappeared.  However, greatly beating the odds against her due to her own perseveranceand the support of friends and outreach workers, Susan recently celebrated her two-yearanniversary being off drugs.  Her relationship with her family has improved, but home is not agood place for her, and she still has no place to live.  She has recently began part-time workdoing outreach to current drug users, plans to get her GED, and wants to eventually get thecollege education necessary to work as a counselor for youth struggling with drug addiction.X. RecommendationsMeeting immediate needsYouth that experience homelessness most often come from families where abuse and instabilityare part of life and their experiences while homeless put their lives and futures at-risk.  Ourpriority must be to get homeless youth into shelter, and to provide the services necessary so thatthey can move into productive and self-sufficient adulthoods.For youth currently experiencing homelessness, funding should be increased for all programsserving homeless youth, so that more youth can receive services.  The appropriate services forany particular youth depend on the circumstances that led them to become homeless, theappropriateness and likelihood of family reunification, the age of the youth, and other factors.  Acomprehensive continuum of care for homeless youth includes the following types of services:Ø Crisis Intervention and Reunification: To reunify youth at-risk of homelessness with theirfamilies or to find another appropriate placement.Ø Outreach Programs: Reaching youth on the streets and in the places they stay to let themknow that help is available.Ø Drop-in Centers: Providing an initial point of contact with a broad range of services andreferrals.Ø Emergency Shelters: Getting youth into a safe environment to evaluate their needs anddetermine an appropriate long-term program.Ø Transitional Living Programs: Providing longer-term housing, often group living orsupervised apartments, from which youth can finish their education, learn independent livingskills, and gain employment.Ø Independent Living Programs: Enabling youth to live on their own in the community witha range of support services until they are fully stable.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 14Ø Permanent Affordable Housing: Promoting the long-term stability of individuals andfamilies.Measuring Program OutcomesIDHS does not currently track the outcomes of these types of state-funded programs.  Based on aCCH survey of Homeless Youth programs, many programs are successful at returning youth totheir home or moving youth to independence.  Table 2 shows the outcomes for three state-fundedtransitional living programs during fiscal year 2000.  Success rates, where the youth returnedhome or moved into an apartment, ranged from 63 percent to 81 percent.Table 2: Success rates for selected IDHS Homeless Youth programsduring fiscal year 2000Children’s Home Assoc.PeoriaYMCA NetworkAlsipYouth Service BureauSpringfieldØ Youth Leaving Program: 48Ø Youth Leaving Program: 19Ø Youth Leaving Program: 58Ø Returned Home: 10 Ø Returned Home:  5 Ø Returned Home: 14Ø Moved into an Apartment: 26Ø Moved into an Apartment: 7Ø Moved into an Apartment: 33Ø Success Rate: 75% Ø Success Rate: 63% Ø Success Rate: 81%Additional research should focus on what types of programs and services successfully meet theneeds of homeless youth, and on the development of best practice models for these programs.Long-term recommendationsIncreasing family stability is the best way to prevent youth homelessness.  One way to definestable families is to say that stable families help develop the emotional competence of theirchildren so that children can focus on doing well in school, get along with peers and adults, delaygratification, and bounce back quickly after stressful experiences.  Parents who grew up in stablefamilies themselves are more likely to be able to care for their children in such a way as todevelop their children’s emotional competence.xxiiiEvidence is strong that economic and community-level factors influence the ability to developemotional competence.  Illinois took two small but important steps to promote the economicstability of families in 2000 by doubling the state's income tax personal exemption from $1,000to $2,000 and establishing an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).  The state EITC is equal to 5percent of the federal EITC and reduces the amount of state income tax due for families withincomes under $31,500 and individuals with incomes below $15,000.  Illinois can make the stateEITC stronger by making the EITC refundable, basing EITC on a higher percentage of thefederal credit, and making the EITC permanent.Combined with safe and decent affordable housing for everyone, living wage jobs, qualityeducation, universal health care, and other resources needed to succeed in our society, one daythere may be a nation where family stability is maximized and homelessness no longer part ofour vocabulary.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 15The Stories Behind the NumbersRyan was 17 years old when he came to the Children’s Home Association of Illinois in Peoria.His mother was in prison and his father’s precise whereabouts were unknown.  Ryan had goalsfor himself, such as finishing high school and getting a job, but was unsure of how he wouldaccomplish his goals with no place to call home.  With the support of the Homeless YouthServices program, he was able to pay his rent with rent subsidies, find employment, finishschool, and develop a dependable support system while he worked on improving his relationshipwith his mother.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 16Appendix A: Detailed research methods for population estimateThe current population estimate was determined by determining the total size of the followingpopulations:Ø The number of youth served by Homeless Youth programs funded by the Illinois Departmentof Human Services (IDHS) during fiscal year 2000. Source: IDHS.Ø The number of youth denied services by IDHS Homeless Youth programs due to the lack ofprogram resources during fiscal year 2000.  This figure was estimated based on a survey ofthese programs conducted by CCH.  Ten of 20 programs responded to the survey.  Foragencies that did not respond to the survey, it was assumed that they did not turn away anyclients.  To avoid duplication of youth in Chicago (the only part of the state with multipleprograms), the number of youth denied services was based on the response of the singleprovider with the largest number of youth denied services.Ø The number of youth that experience homelessness served by Homeless Youth programs thatprovide residential services that were not funded by the Illinois Department of HumanServices during fiscal year 2000. This figure was based on a CCH survey of knownprograms.  Five of six programs responded.Ø The number of youth served by IDHS-funded Comprehensive Community Based YouthServices (CCBYS) programs who experienced homelessness and were not served by, and didnot seek services from, Homeless Youth programs. IDHS was the source for the total numberof youth served during fiscal year 2000.  Other figures were determined based on a CCHsurvey of CCBYS agencies.  Forty-seven percent, or 33 out of 70 programs, responded to thesurvey.To identify youth who are experiencing homelessness we asked the CCBYS agencies whatpercentage of the youth with whom they work with are not living with a parent or guardianand not in a safe and stable living environment.  An overall estimate of 9 percent of CCBYSclients who are not living with a parent or guardian and not in a safe and stable livingenvironment was determined by weighting individual responses by program size.To avoid duplication with youth served by, or denied services by, all Homeless Youthprograms, the total number of youth served by these programs was subtracted from the totalnumber of youth served by CCBYS programs before determining the number of CCBYSclients that experienced homelessness.One complication of this process was that CCBYS programs serve youth from 0 to 17 yearsold while Homeless Youth programs serve youth 14 to 21 years old.  Based on data fromIDHS, in 2000 approximately 64 percent of the 12,722 youth served by CCBYS programswere aged from 15 to 17, or 8,131 youth.  Based on a survey of providers, for the HomelessYouth programs it was assumed that 35 percent of the youth served and seeking shelter werefrom 14 to 17 or 1,369 of 3,912 youth.  The number of CCBYS youth who experiencehomelessness was based on the figures adjusted for the client age.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 17Ø The number of 18 to 21 year olds in adult shelters in Illinois.  This figure includes 18 to 21year-olds who are not unaccompanied youth (i.e., those with their parents or guardian), butwe believe this number to be minimal.   Source: IDHS for fiscal year 2000.Ø An estimate of the number of homeless youth who never come into contact with the socialservice system.  This number is based on a 1995 national study sponsored by the Family andYouth Service Bureau of the United Sates Department of Health and Human Services.Through an interagency agreement between the Administration on Children, Youth andFamilies and the National Center for Health Statistics, the researchers added a series ofquestions regarding runaway experiences to the Youth Risk Behavior Supplement of theNational Health Interview Survey.  The survey had 6,496 respondents 14.8 percent of whohad a runaway experience.  The findings were published in Youth with Runaway,Throwaway, and Homeless Experiences: Prevalence of Drug Use, and Other At-RiskBehaviors.The study determined that only 25 percent of youth 12-17 who had a runaway experiencemade use of a youth or adult shelter.   Youth were defined as having had a runawayexperience if they had spent at least one night in one of the following locations during theprevious 12 months: a youth or adult shelter, a public place, an abandoned building, outside,with someone they did not know because they had no place to stay, or in a subway or otherunderground public place.  Because this definition was based on the youth’s housing status,for the purposes of this report these youth can also be said to have had a homelessexperience.Ø To acknowledge that youth who experience homelessness have variable types of experiences,we have attempted to identify the number of youth have what we define as chronichomelessness experiences as a subset of the overall population of homeless youth.  Thefederal study cited above determined that 54 percent of “street youth,” surveyed made use ofshelter services.  This difference in our estimates of the number of youth who have prolongedhomeless experiences and the number of homeless youth overall was based on the differentutilization rates found in the household and street surveys.Comparison of research method with the 1985 Governor’s Task Force studyThe above method is very similar to the method used by the Governor’s Task Force on YouthHomelessness in 1985 to develop a population figure for homeless youth. Through a surveyconducted by the task force of social service providers working with homeless youth and youthat-risk of homelessness, the task force determined the number of homeless youth currentlyserved and the number of youth denied services by existing providers.  Based on then currentacademic studies, the task force estimated the number of homeless youth who have no contactwith social service agencies. The sum of these three populations (youth served, youth deniedservices, and \"no contact\" youth) was 21,535. The task force’s estimate of the \"no contact\" youthwas based on the assumption that 25 percent of youth who experience homelessness make use ofthe social service system — the same utilization rate used for the current study.Youth On The Streets and On Their Own: Youth Homelessness in IllinoisChicago Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                      Page 18Endnotes                                         i Jody M.

If the 1985 estimate had included 21year olds it would have been approximately 13 percent higher, about 24,500 homeless youth, based on the age distribution of thegeneral population in Illinois in 1985.  The number of youth under 14 who meet the definition of a homeless youth as defined inthis report is believed to be minimal.  According to census figures, in 1985 1.65 percent of persons age 14 to 21 experiencedhomelessness as defined in this report.  In 2000, the figure was 1.79 percent.

    "abstract": "CCH estimates that over the course of a year, approximately 26,000 youth in Illinois experience homelessness. This is slightly more than reported in a 1985 state-funded study. Homeless youth are between the ages of 14 and 21, have left home because of serious family problems, and are not in a safe and stable living situation. Youth that experience homelessness are likely to experience abuse and neglect both before and after becoming homeless. We estimate that forty-five percent, or approximately 12,000, of these youth have chronic homeless experiences. Youth in this category live outside and in other public places for prolonged periods, face sometimes insurmountable obstacles to returning home, and have an especially high likelihood of being abused and victimized while they are homeless. Available housing resources for homeless youth do not come close to meeting the need for these services. A CCH survey found that 42 percent of youth seeking shelter from state-funded Homeless Youth programs were turned away last year due to lack of resources. Eighty-eight percent of state-funded crisis intervention programs for youth responded that they need additional residential resources for homeless youth. Abuse (physical, emotional, and/or sexual), substance abuse by a parent, absence of a parent, and long-term family economic problems are all common family experiences among youth that experience homelessness. Pregnant and parenting teens, former and current wards, and youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or questioning (LGBTQ) account for a highly disproportionate segment of the population of homeless youth. Homeless youth, particularly those with chronic experiences, have a difficulty meeting their basic needs, as well as a high likelihood for physical and sexual victimization, engaging in substance abuse, engaging in unprotected sexual activity, and delinquency. Many are not enrolled in or regularly attending school, and these youth have limited access to services for their physical and emotional health care needs. Due to a 1999 increase in funding for programs serving homeless youth, however, the State of Illinois has made some progress in recent years with regard to providing shelter and supportive services for this vulnerable population. For example, in fiscal year 2000 IDHS spent $4.17 million on programs specifically for homeless youth and served 2,105 youth. In 1996, when the state spent half as much on these programs, only 986 youth were served. Between 1986, when the state started funding programs for homeless youth, and 1994 the state only spent about $1 million annually for these programs. We recommend that the State of Illinois increase expenditures for emergency, transitional, and long-term supportive housing for currently homeless youth, in order to assist these youth in becoming self-sufficient, productive adults. We also recommend that more resources be put into the prevention of youth homelessness through early intervention with at-risk families. Finally, we call for the expansion and implementation of policies that promote the long-term economic and social stability of families",
