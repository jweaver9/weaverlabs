Introduction \nThere is change in the air. The world is undergoing significant transformations on multiple \nfronts, such as: within technology and networks e.g. the wide dissemination and availability of \nthe internet, 3D printing; in the biotechnological medical world e.g. cloning, genetically \nmodified food, gene therapy, artificially grown tissue and “body banking” (Åsberg & Neimanis \n2013; Haraway 2008); in military operations e.g. drones, state sponsored cyber-attacks \n(Haraway 1991; Braidotti 2013, 2006; Puar 2005; Hovenden et al. 2013). Moreover, many have \nidentified a fundamental shift in capitalism and a global restructuring of capitalist production, \ncausing a feminisation (Perrons 2004), de-masculinisation or ‘precarisation’ of the labour \nmarket (Hardgrove, McDowell & Rootham 2015; Beck 1992, 2000: Beck & Beck-Gernsheim \n2000), occurring particularly at the lower levels of the labour market, including traditional \nindustry (as above), but also non-traditional industries such as care work (Boris & Salazar \nParreñas 2010) and sex work (Bernstein 2010). At the same time, there have been radical \nreductions in social security or ‘welfare’ provisions and a privatisation of national services \nunder neoliberal governments (Haraway 1991: 166-169; Masquelier 2013).  \n \nThese transformations are simultaneously happening within the subject.  According to Haraway \n(2013) we are all already cyborgs, since we humans1 are already modified and continually \nmodifying ourselves. These modifications could be as simple as paying for laser eye surgery \nto enhance vision, receiving a pacemaker, or could be as complex as controlling the movement \nof a robotic arm with one’s mind2. As a bringing together of two elements, the cybernetic and \nthe organism, Haraway’s cyborg is an attempt to overcome the binary distinctions that have \ncome to dominate our consciousness - binarisms like human and non-human, machine and \norganic, nature and culture. The cyborg is thus neither nature nor culture, but rather a hybrid \nof both and more. This is because the cyborg is not limited by and to binaries (50).  \n \nSince such a fundamental shift is occurring, there has been a subsequent declaration that a new \nand improved theory of the subject is needed to understand these changes. For instance, \nBraidotti (2013) argues that “... we need new frameworks for the identification of common \npoints of reference and values in order to come to terms with the staggering transformations \n                                                                \n1 Perhaps the assumption that only humans will read this thesis is misplaced – considering the proliferation of \nanti-plagiarism software that will be reading this thesis as well? Lund University uses URKUND, which you can \nread about here: http://www.lub.lu.se/en/search-systems-and-tools/urkund \n2 https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26703-thought-control-makes-robot-arm-grab-and-move-objects/ \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n2 \n \nwe are witnessing” (196). Such an alternative theoretical understanding, it is argued, can be \nfound within posthuman theory. Posthuman feminist scholarship has positioned itself as \ninstrumental in opening up alternative avenues through which we can understand the subject, \nsuch as rendering unintelligible nature/ culture, human/ non-human, organic/ machine \nbinarisms (Haraway 2013) whilst linking inextricably humans to the so-called ‘natural world’ \nthat has been constructed as wholly separate and inferior to humans since the Enlightenment \nera (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013; Federici 2004). More than this, posthumanist scholarship \nintroduces what Braidotti calls “... a qualitative shift in our thinking about what exactly is the \nbasic unit of common reference for our species, our polity and our relationship to the other \ninhabitants of this planet.” (Braidotti 2013: 1-2). Our new uncertain world has opened up \n“opportunities” (12) to recreate understandings of subjectivity, and feminist posthuman \ntheorists are argue for their responsibility for these new constructions (Haraway 1991: 150; \nBraidotti 2013). \n \nAs indicated above, posthuman theory is predicated on the collapse of the nature-culture binary, \nand the subsequent (or even simultaneous) need to conceive of new ways of understanding \nsubjectivity (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013; Braidotti 2013; Scott 2001; Neimanis 2013; Haraway \n1991) as humans now placed on a continuum, rather than on the “culture” half of the “nature/ \nculture” binary (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013; Braidotti 2013). Thus, posthuman theorists position \nthemselves as responsible for creating “... adequate theoretical and imaginary representations \nfor our lived conditions…” (Braidotti 2013: 187). This includes, but of course is not limited to \nthe issue of subjectivity. Subjectivity as a topic is one quite central to posthuman theory, \nprimarily because subjectivity is the site where multiple matters converge, and, conversely, the \nsubject is a unifying thread among different issues and aspects of these posthuman times (42). \n \n1.1. Aims and research question \nOne of the spaces where posthuman theorists are creating these new representations for our \nlived conditions -as Braidotti (2013) argues above- is within the field of politics. Removal of \nthe traditional Humanist subject in favour of a posthuman one is not to remove or to lessen the \nneed for political action and subversion, but rather the opposite. In Posthuman, All Too Human \nBraidotti (2006) argues that:  \n“The hyper-reality of the nomadic or cyborg post-human predicament does not wipe \nout politics or the need for political resistance: it just makes it more necessary than ever \nto work towards a radical redefinition of political action.” (203) \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n3 \n \nThis notion - of creating a ‘radical redefinition’ of political action- is part of the creation new \n‘theoretical representations of our lived conditions’ (Braidotti 2013: 187) that Braidotti argues \nfor, and has been focal point for a number of theorists. For example, Papadopoulos (2010) \nrethinks the possibilities for posthumanism within radical left projects and social movements. \nHe argues that over time, the focus of social movements and radical left projects has shifted \nonto ‘social power’ (which I take to mean an identity based activism), which promotes an \nanthropocentric worldview and subsumes ‘true justice’ rather than being properly liberatory. It \nis in this context that Papadopoulos asks how left politics can become more posthuman, and \nvice versa (144). Papadopoulos’ article helps to form the background to this research because \ngiven that his main argument is that organisations focused on “social power” cannot or will not \nbe posthuman in nature, I am interested to see if this assertion is borne in my own research too.  \n \nFollowing these insights, I am interested not only how in posthuman theory can create new \nways of understanding subjectivity and political action, but also in how the individuals who \nengage in political action (such as activism) understand themselves as subjects, as well as how \nthey operationalise notions of ‘individual’, ‘agency’, ‘non-human’, in an era where humanist \nunderstandings are still widespread enough to be considered common sense.  \n \nI argue that situating these questions within an organisation aimed at “social power”, or more \nspecifically, on the activists within such an organisation, is an interesting avenue through which \nto explore the intersection between the subject, activism, and posthuman theory. Part of the \nlogic behind this is the belief that those who engage in identity based activism (alternatively \ndescribed as ‘social power’ activism by Papadopoulos 2010) will have considered and \nreconsidered their identity positionings, both as individuals and as activists more than non-\nactivists, and so be able to reflect more on themselves as subjects, and the intersection between \ntheir activism and subject identity. \n \nResearch aims \n To explore posthuman theoretical approaches to subjectivity;  \n To explore the intersection between the subject, activism, and posthuman theory;  \n To see if activists understand their subjectivity in posthuman ways;  \n \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n4 \n \nResearch questions \n1. In what ways, if any, can critical posthuman theory be used to understand the \nsubjectivity of those who engage in identity based, political activism? \n2. How do activists within identity based organisations or associations understand and \nexplain their own subjectivities? \n \nI am seeking to understand whether posthuman approaches to subjectivity can be compatible \nwith these activists’ understandings and declarations of their own subjectivities. These \nquestions also try to understand how a posthumanist framing of the individual can work within \nmodern politically oriented rights based organisations, which are purportedly based on an \n‘individualist’ self (Papadopoulos 2010; Masquelier 2013). \n \n1.2. Research design \nAutobiographical texts within the anthology Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer \nAsian/ Pacific American Activists (Kumashiro 2011) will be analysed as part of exploring these \nquestions and aims. The analysis will be conducted using the help of NVivo, a qualitative data \nanalysis software. NVivo will enable the electronic storage of all materials, memos and coding \nassociated with this thesis project. \n \nI consider that I am conducting a feminist research into posthuman theory, and the intersection \nbetween the subject, activism, and posthuman theory, vis-à-vis an analysis of the \nautobiographical accounts within this anthology. More than this, a range of theories inform the \n‘ethico-onto-epistem-ological’ (Barad, 2007; Lykke, 2010) outline of this thesis, which affect \nmy understandings of the subject, and the methodologies and methods utilised to analyse the \ntexts from Restoried Selves.  \n \n1.3. Research delimitations \nIn general, limiting the scope of one’s research is beneficial in some ways, but detrimental in \nothers. This is primarily because it is difficult to achieve equilibrium between narrowing down \nones research focus whilst still aiming to contribute to the wider field of knowledge. However \nthe fields of subjectivity and activism are huge and multifaceted in their own right. Hence, in \norder to create an understandable and coherent analysis of the intersection between the subject, \nactivism, and posthuman theory, I have decided to focus the wider issue of subjectivity onto a \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n5 \n \nspecific site, that of Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay, Trans* and Queer (henceforth LGBTQ3) and \nAsian and/or Pacific American (henceforth APA) identified activists. LGBTQ and race-based \nactivist groups are exemplary cases of ‘identity based’ activist groups and so I argue that this \nthesis will yield particularly compelling insights via the autobiographical texts of activists, who \narguably focus their activism on what Papadopoulos (2010) calls ‘social power’ and are thus \nspecifically interesting in the context of these discussions about subjectivity, activism and \nposthumanism. One key delimitation of utilising autobiographical texts of LGBTQ APA \nactivists is that although these texts will give me insight into how these individuals’ \nsubjectivities, and perhaps their processes of subjectification4, but perhaps cannot be made \nwidely replicable to other activists groups, or to a non-activist LGBTQ and/or APA population. \n \n1.4. Schematic outline for this thesis \nAfter this introduction into the research, and presentation of the research aims and questions, I \nwill go on in chapter 2 to provide a critical description and overview of the current state of \nacademic knowledge relating to and background of posthuman theory. After this, in chapter 3, \nI will present the theoretical starting points of my research, including a discussion about and a \njustification for choosing these theories. In chapter 4, I will present, discuss and substantiate \nthe methods I have chosen to use for this research, and provide a comprehensive outline of my \nontological, epistemological, ethical and methodological starting points. There will also be an \nintroduction to the empirical material that will be analysed for this research. Following this, \nchapter 5 will be an analysis of the material in relation to the research aims and questions, \nwhich are laid out above, then a discussion in chapter 6 will follow about what these findings \nmean in the context of previous research and the theoretical underpinnings of this research, and \na critical view for the results from the analysis. In the concluding chapter, I will reflect on the \nresearch question and the methodologies used, and provide suggestions for further research. \n \n2. Definitions and Literature Review \nDuring this thesis, I will utilise the terms posthumanism, Humanism and anti-humanism \nextensively. Therefore it is necessary to define these terms with regards to how they will be \noperationalised. I will expand these on these definitions with an analysis and debate regarding \n                                                                \n3 I have attempted to retain as inclusive a definition as I can, to account for the multiple subject positioning of \nthe authors within this anthology. However, for the sake of reader clarity, I have and will continue to utilise the \nwell-known acronym LGBTQ, summarised here: http://www.liberateyourself.co.uk/lgbtq/what-is-lgbtq/  \n4 For more on subjectification, see Foucault’s The subject and Power (1982); Discipline and Punish (1977) \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n6 \n \nthe current state of knowledge in the field of posthuman theory, generating the background \nfrom which the analysis of the thesis will occur. \n \n2.1 Definitions \nPosthumanism \nWhen discussing posthumanism, it is important to note that there are different meanings of the \nterm ‘posthuman’ and ‘posthumanism’ in different contexts. In academia for example, \nposthumanism is understood as a cultural critique and a challenge to the Humanities, whereas \nin a wider cultural context, it is understood to mean robotics, cybernetics and the like. I mean \nto follow Braidotti in her use of ‘critical Posthumanism’5. As a brief overview, critical \nposthuman theory is a strand of posthumanism deriving from anti-humanist philosophies of \nsubjectivity (Braidotti 2013: 38), whose foundational theories are firstly anti-humanism, which \nis defined and delimited below; secondly, postcolonial and race theorists -theories which \nconsider the Enlightenment failed in its own ideals; and thirdly, ecology and environmentalist \ntheories -which focuses on interconnectedness and rejects individualism (46-7). It is important \nto state that I do not use posthumanism to describe a technophilic ‘trans-humanism’, which is \nthe hope that technology will ‘enhance’ bodies, doing away with the inconveniences of aging, \nailments and in some cases death. This is a culmination of what Åsberg and Neimanis (2013) \ncall “...the desire to realize the disembodied human self of the Enlightenment, purified and \nenhanced by science, medicine, and technology…” (5). This is a self which has achieved its \nultimate separation from both nature and culture - an individual (in the traditional \nconceptualisation) segregated from and placed above others. I argue that this is a concept that \ndisregards vulnerability, and privileges certain kinds of bodies over others and is therefore \nincompatible with the posthumanist theory I am operationalising. \n \nHumanism \nHumanism is a philosophical movement which emphasises the individual agency of ‘human \nbeings’, and traditionally favours the doctrines of critical thinking, empiricism and secularism. \nHumanist theory remains so pervasive it is often held as ‘common sense’ (Braidotti, 2013: 1). \nFederici (2004) discusses how, in the Enlightenment era of the West in early 1600s to late \n                                                                \n5 For reader clarity I will henceforth use the terms posthuman theory and posthumanism rather than ‘critical \nposthumanism’. This is because I take understand that critical posthumanism is a central strand within wider \nposthuman theory, as well as the primary operationalisation of the term that I use in this thesis. This is unless of \ncourse I am specifically discussing another branch of posthumanism, e.g. analytical posthumanism, in which \ncase this will be explicitly stated within the text. \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n7 \n \n1700s philosophers such as Descartes (1972) and Hobbes (1981), while different \nphilosophically, generated enduring binarisms, divorcing the ‘rational self’, or ‘soul’ from \ncorporeal baseness and nature (Federici 2004: 148). At the same time, a ‘mercantile \nbourgeoisie’ -with a deeply ingrained protestant ethic and awareness of these new \nphilosophical understandings of the self- emerged, seeking to ‘remould’ the lower class6 in line \nwith capitalistic need (135), This leads Federici to assert that: “We can see, in other words, \nthat the human body and not the steam engine, and not even the clock, was the first machine \ndeveloped by capitalism.” (146, original emphasis). With nature reduced to baseness, it too was \nconstructed as Other to the newly emerged rational subject. And just like nature could be \n“caught in a system of subjection,” (Foucault 1977: 26) so could the body (Federici 2004: 140). \n \nWhile some theorists argue that the concept of ‘subject’ is normative and limiting (Puar 2012), \nPosthuman theorists generally recognise that some subject positioning is important (with \ncertain caveats) as a site for ‘political accountability, collective imaginaries and shared \naspirations’ (Braidotti 2013:102). However, the subject as it has been understood within \nHumanism is problematic, not least because whilst generally understood as ‘universal’, the \nHumanist ideal of ‘the subject’ has not been extended to vast swathes of people, such as those \npositioned as non-white, non-male, those who are working class or somehow inferior - overall, \nthose that have been cast as “Other” (Federici 2004: 152; Braidotti 2013: 1). The Other has \nbeen racialised, naturalised as well as dehumanised within Humanism, leading Braidotti (2013) \nto argue that “What seems absolutely clear to me is the historical, ethical and political necessity \nto overcome this notion [of the Humanist subject], in light of its history of unfulfilled promises \nand unacknowledged brutality” (51). This shift is needed, and it is not to be seen as a crisis but \nrather as an opportunity to create alternative theorisations of the subject. \n \nAnti-humanism \nAnti-humanist, or else alter-humanist (Kumar 2011) thinkers and activists have levelled \nimportant critique towards Humanism, including drawing attention to the fact that both the \nconcept and ideals of ‘individualism’, and the ‘universal man’ are historical constructs, and not \n‘intrinsic’ to subjects. Moreover, the anti-humanist perspective has historically been central to \nmany social and political movements in recent history, indeed for Braidotti (2013) anti-\n                                                                \n6 Lower classes, not yet working classes. As Federici (2004) makes clear, previous to these changes, the lower \nclasses were serfs and artisans and had to be moulded through centuries of violence to become the working class \n(135) \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n8 \n \nhumanist theoretical thinkers and activists have been a significant source for posthuman theory, \nbut it is important to note that the association between anti-humanism and posthumanism is not \ninevitable or even necessary (25).  \n \nAnti/ alter-humanists - whilst still decrying the ‘abuse’ of Humanist ideals/ principles- largely \nuphold the basic premises and ideals of Humanism (Kumar 2011; Fanon 2008), whereas \nposthuman theorists argue that Humanism and Humanists ideals should not be rebuilt, but \nrather completely overcome (Braidotti 2013; Haraway 1991; Åsberg & Neimanis 2013). \n \n2.2. The posthuman field \nRecently posthuman theory has become more central within the trans- and post-disciplinary \nsocial sciences, as evidenced by the establishment of research centres7 dedicated to the study \nof posthumanities, special issues on posthumanities in established journals8 and a proliferation \nin articles discussing or utilising posthuman themes.  \n \nPosthuman theorists can be found to discuss and analyse a wide range of issues, very much in \nline with their post- or trans-disciplinary approach. However, as indicated in the introduction, \nthere are a few essential starting points of posthuman theory. For instance, one vital aspect of \nposthuman theory is its position as challenger the humanities and to Humanism more broadly, \narguing that they are insufficient tools to understand the human’s increasingly complex \nenmeshment in relationships with non-human animals, the environment, technology (and so \non) within our era of Anthropocene, where humans have a dominant and dominating influence \non the environment, climate, and life on this planet more extensively, and in more ways than \never before (Neimanis 2013; Braidotti 2013). \n \nAs discussed in the introduction, there is hardly a site where this challenge is more fierce and \nmulti-levelled than that of subjectivity. For instance, Åsberg and Neimanis (2013) argue that \nwhile the humanistic Enlightenment ideals of a subject, contained and individual, underpins \n“... many if not all of our social, political, economic and legal frameworks in the Western \nworld…” (2), it is obvious that this subject is ‘disintegrating before our very eyes’ (Ibid) and \n                                                                \n7 See for example the work with the ‘posthumanities hub’ at Linköping University, Sweden. \n8 See for example the special issues of NORA: Nordic Journal of Feminist and Gender Research (2011, 19:4) \nand European Journal of Women's Studies (2010, 17:4) \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n9 \n \nso posthuman theorists work to reconsider the ontology of bodies, and present new forms of \nbeing in the space that this disintegration has created.  \n \nIndeed, other theorists emphasise that the embodied and embedded subject is vitally important \nto posthuman theories (Braidotti 2013; Currier 2003; Scott 2001). Barad (2003) creates a \nposthumanist materialist reworking of the concept of performativity (811), whilst arguing that \npower is material, and not just social, we need to account for the material, embodied situations \nof all bodies and all forms of agency (not just human ones). For Åsberg and Neimanis (2013), \nbuilding new conceptions of the subject entails recognising the symbiosis humans have with \nother beings like bacteria, arguing that humans are companion species to these other beings \n(see also Haraway 2008: 16-17). Simultaneously, posthuman theories of subjectivity are \nbuilding understandings that humans are not “in here” and the environment is “out there” and \nthat we are instead inextricably linked. With these new understandings, Åsberg and Neimanis \nargue that to ‘reconsider the ontologies of bodies’ (4) is to reconfigure individualist conceptions \nof agency and the subject. In this understanding the subject is embedded in practices of \naffectivity and of care and concern for others. In short, “....engagement is key to feminist \nposthuman ethics; concerns for alterity and care for others is prior to selfhood.” (21, emphasis \nadded). \n \nWhilst Åsberg and Neimanis emphasise the responsibility of posthuman selves, others such as \nOffermann (2012) argues posthuman subjects create an opportunity for subversion and that \n“Through the interconnections and hybridizations, body-subjects can emerge which are able to \nsubvert the efforts of normalization of the existing, heteronormative and phallocentric regime \nof sexuality. This ability constitutes the political potential for a queer-feminist agenda” (3, \nemphasis added). This notion of political potential, based on an emphasis of the posthuman \nbody-subject and its interconnections, acts as an important insight into posthuman theorisations \nof how this political subversion may occur, especially when considered as complementary to \nthe notion of feminist posthuman ethics as set forward by Åsberg and Neimanis (2013). \n \nAlong the same vein, other posthuman theorists describe how the boundary between the \npreviously binary categories of “human” and “animal” have been breached. On the one hand, \nthe more the animal sciences ‘discover’ about animals, the harder it is to maintain the \nboundaries that have distinguished and set above the human from non-human. On the other \nhand, bio-genetic technologies are “post-anthropocentric’ in that non-human animals, the \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n10 \n \nenvironment and humans universally fall under capitalistic market imperatives and are \nexploited (Haraway 1991; Braidotti 2013). At the same time, new networks and technologies \nbreak down the boundary between physical and non-physical worlds and the distinction \nbetween human and machine (Haraway 1991: 153, 164-5; Currier 2003). \n \nOther theorists argue that posthuman theories of subjectivity have similarities to other theories. \nHoogland (2002) for instance, sees posthuman theories of the body as similar to the \npsychoanalytic idea of the ‘body ego’, where the body “... becomes a shifting and \nfundamentally dynamic site of human-machinic interaction within a no less changeable set of \nboth symbolic and material impossibilities, both real and imaginary.” (223). It is therefore \nimportant to be mindful of these background influences, in addition to the influences laid out \nby Braidotti (2013) which are discussed above. \n \nMethodological beginnings for posthuman theorists  \nIndeed, several posthuman theorists have utilized Braidotti’s figurations (Lykke, 2010; \nBraidotti, 2006) as a tool to understand these new posthuman subjects. Collard (2012) argues \nthat figurations are a “... powerful means by which to interrogate naturalized narratives and by \nwhich to suggest new ones. But figures can also be subjects of interrogation themselves. (523). \nFor instance, understanding ourselves as a companion species, rather than merely human, \nenables us to reconsider our responsibilities towards others - it is in this context that Neimanis \nasks us to see ourselves within the ‘figuration’ of a bodies of water (Neimanis, 2013). Similarly, \nCollard (2012) utilises the figuration of ‘cougars’, and Åsberg and Neimanis (2013) utilise \nfigurations such as ‘Alzheimer bodies’ (15) when constructing new ontologies of bodies (4). \nHowever, perhaps the best known figuration is that of the Cyborg (Haraway, 1991). As the \ncyborg is thus neither nature nor culture, but rather a hybrid of both and more, it allows us to \nsee alternative non-binary configurations of the subject. \n \nConversely, Kirkup (2013) points out that while “[the cyborg’s] usefulness for cultural \ndeconstruction of gender has become apparent, but its usefulness as a tool for material change \nis yet to be proved.” (5). Therefore it is important to recognize that posthuman research on the \nsubject have until now been almost entirely theoretical, or a ‘becoming’ - a subject yet to come, \none that is mapped out. Given this, I plan to research contemporaneous, embodied subjects, in \norder to add to a body of literature which focuses on the material aspect of posthuman theory. \nBy doing this I hope to consider posthuman theory from a new perspective, that is, when \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n11 \n \nanalysing contemporary LGBTQ APA identified activist subjects, and examining their \nreflections of their own subjectivities and processes of subjectification.  \n \nWe can see that the literature here indicates that questions of posthuman subjectivity heighten \nthe need to focus on political action, however, theoretical models regarding subjectivities and \nactivism has been the primary methodological starting point for research. It is much harder to \nfind any empirical analyses of contemporary activist subjects. As such, during this research, I \nhope to generate a methodological starting point for posthuman theorists who wish to conduct \nresearch on ‘real world’ subjects, rather than exclusively with theoretical and hypothetical \nframings. \n \nCritique of posthuman theory \nPosthumanism challenges the idealised “man” of Humanist theory, just as binaries are broken \ndown in our contemporary society. Bodies are central to this challenge, but identity \n(subjectivity) still remains crucial, posthuman/cyborg theory does not break away from it. \nWhilst generally supportive of posthuman theory, Currier (2003) echoes Kirby’s (1997) \ncritique of posthuman or cyborg theory when arguing that the hybridised cyborg is reliant upon \nthe distinct and discrete ‘components’ of the hybridization. By this Currier means that “... in \nso far as the hybrid cyborg is forged in the intermeshing of technology with a body, in a process \nof addition, it leaves largely intact those two categories – (human) body and technology – that \npreceded the conjunction” (Currier 2003: 323). Currier rightly pinpoints the centrality of the \nsubject to much posthuman theory, but I disagree that recognising or emphasising the body as \na category is somehow incorrect. This is because posthuman theory generally recognises the \nembodied self as a central component to the subject, while recognising the ontological reality \nof a physical self (Braidotti 2013; Åsberg and Neimanis 2013; Barad 2003), which is different \nto Kirby and Currier’s constructions, which argue that the body is culturally does not exist prior \nto discourse. However, this point will be elaborated on further in the methodology chapter, \nrather than here. \n \nAnother critique levelled at posthuman theory is provided by Deckha (2012), who argues that \nwithin posthuman theorisations, gender is often prioritised of as the central dimension of \ninjustice, which is to the expense of other axes of difference. Negating race and cultural \ndifference as equally valid starting points for analysis makes inclusive and subversive research \nimpossible to achieve and so “…This residual essentialism thus renders the analysis \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n12 \n \nconceptually incomplete and even inaccurate” (533). This article has been particularly useful \nto help me understand this potential pitfall of posthumanist theory. While Deckha focuses \nspecifically on race and cultural dimensions, other factors such as class are clearly important \ntoo and as such, I have been mindful of dimensions in addition to gender in this research - \nwhilst still retaining a feminist approach to this research. \n \n3. Theoretical Framework \nIn this section I will outline the foundational theories upon which this thesis is based. My \nresearch is rooted in posthuman theory. Consequentially, the theoretical framework of this \nthesis also functions as a route through which I can explore posthuman theoretical approaches \nto subjectivity, and begin to explore the intersection between this theory, the subject and \nactivism, both of which are defined ‘research aims’ within the introduction. These theoretical \nbeginnings also inform the analysis of the anthology Restoried Selves, which is conducted as \npart of answering my research questions.   \n \nThe following theoretical chapter will focus on: posthuman theory; theories of agency and \nsubjectivity; Assemblage theory; social movement theory and posthuman approaches to \nactivism. \n \n3.1. Posthuman approaches to subjectivity \nAs discussed above, the terms ‘posthuman’ and ‘posthumanism’ have been theorised in \ndifferent ways; thus the theory I am operationalising is specifically ‘critical posthumanism’ \n(following Braidotti 2013). Moreover, while there are certainly links between posthumanist \ntheory with previous feminist scholarship and work -especially when one considers how \nfeminist scholarship has been central to questioning the rational detached scientism of other \nscholarship, and drawing attention to and disturbing the idea of binary gender- I certainly see \nthat posthuman feminist scholarship has been instrumental in opening up alternative avenues \nthrough which to understand ourselves. As I have discussed previously, posthuman theorists \nhave deconstructed binarisms (Haraway 2013) and linked humans back to nature and the so-\ncalled ‘natural world’ (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013). Indeed in the age of the cyborg (Haraway \n1991) such binaries, once held as so important in Western thought, become irrelevant and \nsuperfluous. This illuminates to us that which we once perceived as ‘natural’ was never really \nso - it merely has taken the appearance of ‘natural’ in the Western consciousness (Haraway \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n13 \n \n2013: 54). It then follows that there is no such thing as a ‘natural self’, an individual human \nbody contained from, and separate to, the rest of nature. This change is wholesale. Within \nposthuman theory “Man is displaced by the breakdown not only of categories, such as the \nHuman, which define him, but also of the very logic of identity through which those categories \nare articulated and maintained.” (Currier 2003: 321). However, the Humanist subject is a \nbody/subject that we live the legacy of (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013: 2; Braidotti 2013).  \n \nIt is within this framework that posthuman theorists focus on subjectivity. As Braidotti argues \n“.... a focus on subjectivity is necessary because this notion enables us to string together issues \nthat are currently scattered across a number of domains” (Braidotti, 2013: 42). Accordingly, \nthe central tenets of posthumanist approaches to the subject will be detailed here.  \n \nFirstly, posthumanism aims to theoretically conceive of subjects that are above and beyond \ntraditional Humanistic and Enlightenment understandings and ideals. Indeed, Åsberg and \nNeimanis (2012) conceptualise agency outside the dominant paradigms of Enlightenment \nthought, which as we have discussed privilege the individual subject, considering it as separate \nto and above the constructed category of nature. Their ‘brief and partial inventory of bodies’ \nincludes a call for us to -among other things- recognise the symbiotic relationship that humans \nhave with the bacteria that occupy our bodies and genomes (7-8) and for us to break down the \ndistinction we have of that the environment is ‘out there’ and we are ‘in here’ (9). Thus, the \nposthuman subject has agency to the extent that to be a subject is to exist within the relational \ncontinuum of the everyday, and to be part of the world which forms them, rather than be \nseparate to it.  \n \nThis entanglement does not mean that the posthuman subject ceases to render binaries \nsuperfluous and unintelligible whilst deconstructing that which is considered ‘natural’. Quite \nthe opposite. To be embedded in an ethics of care which considers others before self, is a \nreconsideration the ontologies of bodies’ utilising what Åsberg and Neimanis (2013) call \nfeminist posthuman ethics. Within this conceptualisation, posthuman selves are embedded in \naffectivity and practices of care and concern (21). To follow this new ontology of bodies is to \ncontest the binaries on which the Enlightenment Man claims a sense of self – which is, of the \nself as distinctly individual, as separate to and above ‘nature’. This reconfigures individualist \nconceptions of agency and selfhood, and builds an understanding that all bodies are \ninterconnected, not just human ones. It also emphasises that posthuman theorists are not \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n14 \n \nfocusing primarily on the subject, but rather on the interactions, interdependence and \ninterrelation between the self and everything/ everyone else.  \n \nBraidotti (2013) follows this argument of ethics, asserting that “Posthuman subjectivity \nexpresses an embodied and embedded and hence partial form of accountability, based on a \nstrong sense of collectivity, relationality and hence community building.” (49) This is an \n“...ethics of becoming” (Ibid). This emphasises that posthumanist theorists wish to investigate \nthe meanings of posthuman bodies while remaining attentive embodied experiences (such as \nthe role of class, gender, ethnicity etc.) as they are within the often universalising ventures of \ntechnology (Haraway, 1991; Braidotti 2006; 2013). Within posthuman conceptualisations of \nthe subject there is a shift away from a Humanist ‘man-versus-nature’ conception of self \ntowards an interconnected and inherently reliant self that is fundamentally integrated with \n‘nature’ (environment, internal and wider), non-human animals etc. This is a space where the \nmaterial (‘matter’) and the subject can converge. \n \nPosthumanist theory, as outlined above, is the foundation of the theoretical standpoint for this \nthesis. From the broad starting point of posthumanist theory, I have been intrigued as to what \nhappens to the notion of individual agency, of resistance and subversion in this new posthuman \nscholarship. I feel that posthuman theory is somewhat overlooked or else underutilised within \nacademia, and so by conducting this research I hope to draw attention to the ways in which \nposthuman theory can be utilised. Moreover, I hope to add to the growing body of literature \nthat works with posthuman theory in various ways. \n \n3.2. Theories of subjectivity and agency \nSo, following posthuman theory, it is easy to see how our conception of the individual can be \nradically altered. It is within this framing that I attempt to further explore and understand \nHumanist conceptions of the individual as an agent/ subject. When considering individual \nagency and subjectivity, does existing ‘Humanist’ scholarship become a wholly inadequate and \noutmoded tool to understanding of agency within the posthumanist era? This question will \nbecome increasingly pertinent when it comes to analysing the individual subject’s sense of \nthemselves. To explore this idea, it is useful to be au fait with the varying conceptions of agency \nand subjectivity as they have been understood and debated in key literature. \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n15 \n \nWithin the Western feminist tradition at least, agency is the possibility to act as a subject. The \nnotion of individual agency, moreover, remains pervasive, even within a Western feminist \ntradition which has come to critique it for negating the collective aspects of agency. In The \nPsychic Life of Power (1997), Butler contends that power forms and is performed by the \nsubject. As a subject, one cannot exist without power. Moreover, power acts within us (within \nour psyches), forming us as subjects from the point of passionate attachment, which itself is an \ninduction into power (67). Through this it becomes necessary to understand how power is \nsubjectively performed and the process of subjection. This point is similar to Foucault (1978), \nwho generally understands that the subject does not precede power relations, he sees power \nprimarily in terms of the structures of society, which are unstable and historically situated \n(159). However Butler diverges from Foucault when she argues that the subject only becomes \nunderstandable through exploring the psychic life of the subject and the performance of power \n(Butler 1997: 2). Indeed, performances can inscribe something on the subject, but, at its base, \nit is the performance itself which constitutes the subject (119). To put it another way, power is \nperformative; it is an action, and the act of power is inscribed on the body, and through its \ninscription, a subject is formed. Thus to say that power is imposed from above at a structural \nlevel negates or ignores how power works at the level of the subject’s psyche. This sentiment \nis echoed in Butler’s later works, too. In Giving an Account of Oneself (2005), for example, \nButler points out the role that the social plays in forming the individual agent, arguing that \nagency is what happens when we enact the responsibility to give an account of oneself. In this \nbook Butler also describes the possibility for an agent to destabilise power, stating that this is \nbased on ones relations to others, and in these relations one is \"opaque\" to oneself and \nvulnerable to others (46). Thus to undo norms, we need to resist, and we can only resist when \nwe acknowledge our limits of understanding- this is the moral responsibility to give an account \nof oneself (135).  \n \nHowever, these notions have themselves been criticised as an inherently Western conflation of \nautonomy and agency. Following from this, Mohanty (2003) has argued for a recognition of \ndifference, in opposition to Western feminism which argues for a shared identity based on the \nidea of commonality of experience (108). Mohanty is opposed to the imposition of the notion \nof a 'sameness of experience', because it conceals the fact that the 'sameness of experience' is \nfirmly anchored “in the notion of individual self” (115) specific to Western thought and \nWestern feminism. Subsequent to this, a key standpoint of these critiques is the anti-resistance \nthesis, which questions the assumption that agency is primarily (or can only be) demonstrated \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n16 \n \nin individual resistance mode. For example, Mahmood (2005) suggests that freedom is as \nnormative to feminism as it is to liberalism (10) meaning that there is an inability for Western \nfeminism to see agency within ‘unfamiliar others’, which not only manifests itself in the failure \nto see resistance in unfamiliar modes, but also in the insistence that independent resistance is \nagency’s primary sign. Ergo, the idea of women's agency as identical with resistance to \nrelations of domination is the naturalization of freedom as a social idea. Mahmood argues that \nagency cannot be understood in advance of an analysis of specific modes of being, and so, in \norder to understand those who do not seek to challenge or subvert power, we need to detach \nthe notion of agency from the goals of progressive politics (14), and understand that agency \ncan be formed through attachment to norms and not only resistance of norms. Because norms \nare performed, inhabited and experienced in a variety of ways, Mahmood argues that agency \nshould instead be measured at the contextual level, by examining how norms are practised (22). \nIn this understanding, agency is bound up within historically and culturally specific disciplines \nthrough which a subject is formed. \n \nConsidering the conceptions of agency put forward by theorists such as Butler and Mahmood, \none can conclude that there is more than an element of the social to agency and subjectivity. \nAll in all, Mahmood would not disagree with Butler that power forms and is performed by the \nsubject. Rather, by utilising the works of Mahmood and other postcolonial thinkers, it should \nnot be argued that there is any universal singular agency, but that agency is formed through \nnorms within historical and social contexts and performed through bodily practices - as the \ncapacities and skills required to undertake particular kinds of moral actions. It is clear that we \nmust not assume that all agents are inhabiting an inherently resistive, individual mode of being. \nWhen doing this we are favouring a notion of collective, or social agency over and above the \nnotion of individual agency. \n \nWith these conceptualisations and considering the academic literature, the question becomes \nhow are we then to understand ourselves, agency and subjectivity outside of the dialectical \nparadigms of what human beings are? Following both Butler (1993, 1997, 2005) and Mahmood \n(2005), we must also recognise that the self cannot be formed without relations to others. This \nis important to consider when asking whether any aspects of previous “Humanist” literature on \nthe subject be analogous with posthuman theory is perhaps looking in the wrong direction. \nWithin the context of this research, these ‘Humanist’ conceptions of the subject form an \nimportant background theory. Since the activists which form my empirical analysis may not \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n17 \n \nutilise posthuman conceptions of the self, it becomes important to understand the alternative \ntheorisations through which they may understand themselves. It is also with this in mind that I \nhave discussed Assemblage theory, as an alternative configuration of the subject. \n \n3.3. Assemblage theory \nMy entryway into the field of posthumanist scholarship was not, as one might assume, \nHaraway’s seminal work in the field of posthumanism, A Cyborg Manifesto (1991, 2013), but \nrather through the work of Puar, and her focus on the Deleuzian concept of ‘Assemblage’ in \nQueer Times, Queer Assemblages (2005). In this article, Puar generates dialogue between the \nconcept of Assemblages and that of Intersectionality - primarily Intersectionality as developed \nfrom the works of Crenshaw (1991). Intersectionality has since become a central perspective \nand ethos in feminist research (Puar 2012; 2005), and functions as a structural phenomenon \nwhich presumes that analytical categories of identity (race, gender, class etc.), while \nintersecting with one another, are nonetheless categories which can be separated and \ndisassembled. Puar argues that “Intersectionality demands knowing, naming and thus \nstabilizing of identity across space and time [...]. As a tool of diversity management, and a \nmantra of liberal multiculturalism, intersectionality colludes with the disciplinary apparatus of \nthe state” (Puar 2005: 128). It is through this debate that Puar argues for the theory of \nAssemblages instead of Intersectionality. Assemblages, it is argued, “allows for becoming/s \nbeyond being/s.” (Ibid), as it focuses on ‘tactile economies’, which highlight touch, sensation \nand the like - things which “affect over what is assumed to be legible through the visible” (134).  \n \nPuar also argues that the concept of the subject itself is already normative, so, although \nIntersectionality theory decentres the normative subject of feminism, it remains normative as \nlong as it is wedded to the concept of subject (Puar 2012: 63). According to Puar, her \nexplanation of an Assemblage is the culmination -or bringing together- of tactile economies \nwithin one space/ time, is not even necessarily localised on human bodies (57). An assemblage \nis thus not only understood at the individual -or micro/ meso/ macro- level(s), it can also be \nused to understand the assemblages of complex configurations. This is a way of de-privileging \nthe human body as the central category of experience, as has been the case in Humanist theories \nof the subject. It is here we can see the possible links between posthuman theory and \nAssemblages. Currier (2003), while critical of certain aspects of posthuman theory (see above), \nargues that Assemblage theory can work with posthuman theory to create a ‘new means of \nthinking both bodies and technologies and the conditions of their intersections’ (324). By \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n18 \n \nthinking of the body as an assemblage, one can overcome the ‘logic of identity’ which unifies \nand thus ameliorates differences of experience. At the same time Assemblage theory \nforegrounds connection and linkages as ‘assembled between bodies and technologies’ (336), \nreconfiguring our frames of references and knowledge, while not denying the political or the \nmaterial (328). \n \nIt is this focus on the material, interweaving the self and the wider world which uncovered for \nme new visions of what it means to be, and that led me on to further ‘post subject’ \nconceptualizations of the body. It seemed to me that the concept of Assemblage can take into \nconsideration the environment, the material and the immediate as important factors in a \ncomplex moment-in-time relations, instead of being bound to notions of individual identity and \nindividual relations to structure, institutions etc. From this starting point, I was turned on to the \nworks of Haraway and other posthumanist writers and theorists. However, the primary \ndisconnect between Assemblage and posthuman theory is within the subject. As I have \npreviously argued, the embodied and embedded subject is vitally important to posthuman \ntheories (Braidotti 2013; Currier 2003; Scott 2001; Barad 2003). But conversely, within \nproponents of Assemblage theory such as Puar (2012) identify Assemblage theory as ‘post \nsubject’. Puar argues that “identity is an encounter, an event, an accident, in fact. Identities are \nmulticausal, multidirectional, liminal; traces aren’t always self-evident.” (59). Indeed, for \nDeleuze and Guattari (1987, in Landström 2007), the original proponents of Assemblage \ntheory, subjectivity does not express an essential ‘core’ that is within bodies, but is rather ‘an \neffect of actions performed in assemblages of several humans and non-humans’ (Landström \n2007: 17).  \n \nOn the other hand, I ague that because within Assemblage theory, since subjectivity is regarded \nprimarily through its embeddedness and its assemblage (which is an expression of the material) \n- it is the focus on the embodied and tactile nature of the subject that provides grounds for a \nreconciliation of the posthuman and the assembled subject. Moreover, Landström (2007) \nargues that using Assemblage with posthuman theory can dispel critiques that are levied \ntowards both, such as the critique that Assemblage theory removes gender as a fixed starting \npoint for analysis (17, see also Deckha 2012). To reiterate, the similarities and links between \nAssemblage theory and posthuman theory are clear, as Landström states “While the modern \nsubject was a product explained by its past, the non-humanist perspective features the \nassemblage as moving towards the future. The human element of such ‘post-human’ subjects \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n19 \n \nmay be understood to aim towards connections with others” (20, original emphasis). This \nunderstanding constitutes Assemblage theory as a part of, or complementary to, the posthuman \nsubject, and as such I will bear Assemblage theory in mind when conducting the analysis for \nthis thesis. \n \n3.4. Social movement theory and “life politics” \nSocial movement theorists also argue that social movements have been ambivalent historically, \nsometimes subversive and at others acquiescent to power/ structure (Wennerhag 2010: 25; \nBrowne & Bakshi 2013: 258), and as such investigate not only the underlying causes or \nmotivations to engage in activism, how and in what ways activism manifests itself but also, \nimportantly, the consequences of this activism. \n \nBrowne and Bakshi (2013) for instance seek to understand the consequences of activism in \ntheir study of what they call ‘insider activists’ - those that are simultaneously activists and \nworking within government institutions. In the UK, as in many other countries, there has been \nextensive legislative change to the rights of LGBTQ persons9. Traditionally LGBTQ groups \nhave been opposed to the state but within the context of shifting legislation and movements \naway from police persecution and violence of LGBTQ people has led some activists to take a \nmore ‘legitimate’ i.e. state sanctioned approach to their activisms (254). However at the same \ntime these changes, although welcome, have led “Some (radical, queer and other) \nactivists/scholars [to] assert that working with/for the state forces complicity, compliance and \nco-option…” and creates a de-politicisation of sexual politics (Ibid). \n \nIt is within this context that they explore the perspective of these activists on their activism and \ntheir experiences of “working within”. They argue that “...‘insider activists’ multiple \nnegotiations and identities required them to be within the system and at times simultaneously \noutside of it. This illustrates the complexities of LGBT politics as well as indicating the toll \nsuch activisms can take” (Browne & Bakshi 2013: 261). Overall their result is a nuanced look \nat activism, which concludes somewhere in between the two absolutes that on the one hand, \nthe state de-radicalises LGBTQ activism absolutely, and, on the other that LGBTQ activism is \nonly possible when enacted ‘outside’, always opposing normalisation. They confirmed that \nwhile these activists’ work from within was certainly co-opted by the government institution \n                                                                \n9 These changes will be more thoroughly detailed in section 4.3.1. \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n20 \n \nin which they worked and other institutions such as the police, “…deradicalisation and loss of \nactivism are not always, or necessarily, the result of working within and with the state” (255). \nMoreover, although this study will consider both ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ activists, the work of \nBrowne and Bakshi (2013) will remain important as a reminder to take a nuanced look at the \nimplications and consequences of activism, and to understand the complexities of LGBTQ \nactivisms. \n \nAnother consideration of social movement theorists is to examine the consequences of \nindividualism on social movements and activism. Although the notion of individualisation \nmust be situated historically (Sörbom & Wennerhag 2013: 454), the issue of individualisation \nand its apparent effects on both identification with, and activism within, social justice \nmovements appears as a source of anxiety for social movement theorists. According to \nMasquelier (2013) the worry is how the emergence and entrenchment of neoliberal capitalism \nand ‘highly competitive’ individualism engenders “...a serious challenge for a critique aimed \nat resisting capitalism from the standpoint of culture” (396). While neoliberal capitalism has \ngenerated ‘essential values’ of the self -such as the values of autonomy (in ones working and \npersonal life), creativity, and above all ‘unhindered self-realization’ (399-400) - it is also true \nthat “…the precariousness of a life totally exposed to flexible and unregulated markets \nprecludes the possibility of making them an attainable goal for the majority of individuals” \n(405-6). It is from this understanding of individuals, as enmeshed in unfettered individuality \nand self-realization that prompts concerns, since it is theorised that individuals will be \nunwilling or unable to participate in activism under these conditions. \n \nHowever, the notion that individuals are less inclined to participate in social justice movements \ncannot reasonably argued to be true, but rather one can see how the character of participation \nin social movements has changed over time. According to Sörbom and Wennerhag (2013), \nthere are two types of activism that people engage in. The foremost is identified as \n“organisational belonging”, which is equated with membership and loyalty to collective \npolitical efforts. Latterly, “life politics” is a form of activism that is individualised, \ndisembedded - a politics of self-fulfilment. Although “life politics” activism has become more \nprevalent, and “organisational belonging” has declined over time, it is also clear that “... the \nkind of individualization entailed by life politics or ‘artistic critique’ cannot so easily be \nequated with social atomization, selfishness, and sheer individualism” (474). Furthermore, the \ndifference between “life politics” and “organisational belonging” modes of action are not the \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n21 \n \ndifference between individual and collective political action, because “Politics is always \nundertaken in relation to an imagined collective or on the basis of collective values.” (472). \n \nAs previously discussed I will site this research within activists who engage in so-called “life \npolitics”, more commonly known as “identity politics”. I will examine how these activists \nunderstand their activism and what motivates their activism in order to explore the intersection \nbetween the subject, activism, and posthuman theory. This constitutes one part of this research \nprocess and one of my research aims. \n \nIt is in this context that I will contribute to social movement theoretical understandings of \nactivists. Since this research will analyse LGBTQ activists, who would ostensibly be \nconsidered as engaging in “life politics”, Sörbom and Wennerhag’s (2013) notion of an \n‘imagined collective’ will be an important concept within this research. Moreover, the \nargument that those who participate in “life politics” are individualised, disembedded and \nengaged in a politics of self-fulfilment will also be considered, especially vis-à-vis posthuman \napproaches to activism which are described below.  \n \n3.5. Posthuman approaches to activism \nAs mentioned above, Masquelier (2013) is concerned about how the emergence ‘highly \ncompetitive’ individualism makes impossible the critique and subversion of neoliberal \ncapitalism. He thus seeks to find a unity between various oppressed groups, and argues that \nalthough these groups face different oppressions, as well as differing access to the means of \nchange, “...unity between [oppressed groups] can effectively be identified if the prospects of \njustice, security and emancipation are treated as matters depending on the reconciliation of \nhumanity with nature” (408). \n \nHow then does the posthuman individual, as part of an embedded ‘feminist ethics of care’ and \nfirmly reconciled with nature (Åsberg & Neimanis 2012) engage in political activism, and \nmoreover, how do social movements and organisations take into account the posthuman \nsubject? Papadopoulos (2010) argues that although posthumanism can be found at the ‘heart’ \nof such movements historically, this has changed over time and now contemporary focus of \nsuch groups is on “social power”, which subsumes true justice and liberation. Papadopoulos \nthen aims to rethink the possibilities for posthumanism within radical left projects and social \nmovements, and so it is in this context that he asks: \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n22 \n \n“The question is then: how can we think posthumanism and radical left politics outside \nof mainstream posthumanism as well as outside dominant left traditions that focus \nsolely on the obtaining of social power? How can left politics become more \nposthumanist (again) and how can posthumanism become more left again?” (144) \nPapadopoulos argues that the key to making left politics more posthumanist is in the space to \nmake alternative forms of life (not just human life) - justice is in making these forms of life (or \n“” as he calls them) possible - as long as they engage primarily with ‘matter’. \n \nMoreover, I am interested in how organisations operationalise notions of the ‘individual’, \n‘agency’, and ‘non-human’, in an era where Humanist understandings are still widespread \nenough to be considered ‘common sense’. Papadopoulos (2010) argues that the key to making \nleft politics more posthumanist and creating true justice is in making new forms of life (“alter-\nontologies”) possible - as long as they engage primarily with ‘matter’. The idea of political \norganisations that are focused primarily on ‘matter’ (which, in my reading, means simply the \nmaterial world) is indeed an intriguing one. However, I am aware that the majority of \ncontemporary social justice organisations, at least in the Western world, are focused instead on \nwhat Papadopoulos calls “social power” (purportedly a Humanist endeavour). But rather than \ndismissing all of these organisations as -at best- misguided and at worst anthropocentric \nidealisations which subsume true justice, I seek to understand how a social justice approach \ncan encompass a posthuman framing. Important to my analysis will be the argument that the \nemergence of “life politics” (Sörbom & Wennerhag 2013) or “social power” activism \n(Papadopoulos 2010) does not necessarily equate to individualisation and a loss of collective \npower, as argued above (Sörbom & Wennerhag 2013; Masquelier 2013), as well as \nMasquelier’s (2013) notion of ‘reconciling humanity with nature’. \n \nCentral to this is to explore if a posthumanist framing of the individual, as defined above, can \nwork within so-called “social power”, or organisations focused on obtaining political rights, \nwhich are based on an individualist “social power” perspective. This for me begins at the notion \nof the subject. This is because I assert, following the work of key posthuman authors (Braidotti \n2013; Åsberg & Neimanis 2013; Neimanis 2013; Masquelier 2013) that the notion of ‘subject’ \nor ‘subjectivity’ is not totally incompatible with posthuman theory, but rather I believe that \npopular and academic notions of the self must shift away from a Humanist ‘man-versus-nature’ \nconception of self towards an interconnected and inherently reliant self that is fundamentally \nintegrated with ‘nature’ (environment, internal and wider), non-human animals etc. This is a \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n23 \n \nspace where the material (‘matter’) and the subject can converge. I am therefore interested to \nuncover how we can imagine the subject in posthuman political organisation. \n \n4. Methods and Methodology \nThis chapter will provide insight into starting points for research, as well as the methods that \nwill be utilised throughout the remainder of this thesis. Since broadly speaking, I am coming \nfrom a feminist approach to research, this chapter will detail how I am implementing the term \nand how feminist approaches affect this research. After this, I will discuss in turn the \nontological, epistemological10, methodological11 and ethical bases, and how this reflects upon \nthe methods decided upon to conduct this research. After this outline, I will discuss my ‘ethico-\nonto-epistem-ology’ construct a justification and motivation for the methods (i.e. the \ntechniques or processes by which the research will be completed) chosen, all via a discussion \nof the challenges faced by novice researchers like myself.  \n \n4.1. Feminist Research \nWhile some have argued that feminist researchers have not been able to wholly escape \nEnlightenment ideals of progress and emancipation (Ramazanoğlu & Holland 2002: 36; \nBraidotti 2013), nonetheless feminist methodologies have been consistently critical of the \nEnlightenment focus on dualisms, ‘scientism’ and its focus on ‘absolute truth’ etc. \n \nWhile methodology, methods, epistemology, and even ethical considerations are \ninterconnected, they are certainly distinct in their meanings and applications (Lykke 2010: \n144). Broadly speaking, I and my research are coming from a feminist epistemological and \nmethodological starting point. Clearly feminist methodologies, like most research \nmethodologies, are subject to much debate and divergence. But I mean to follow Ramazanoğlu \n& Holland (2002) in their claim that rather than being distinguished by its subjects, its methods \nor techniques of research, or even its epistemologies and ontologies, feminist research is \ndistinguished by “... the relations between epistemology and politics in feminist research.” (15). \nSimilarly, Lykke (2010) argues that while feminist epistemological and methodological \n                                                                \n10 As a definition, “Epistemology is a philosophical term referring to the setting up of criteria for the production \nof scientific knowledge and definitions of what science is.” (Lykke 2010: 125) - it is the question of ‘how can \nwe know’ or ‘how can we uncover/ understand/ research’ phenomena \n11 As a definition, “Used loosely, ‘method’ indicates a general approach to research [...]. A methodology in \nsocial research comprises rules that specify how social investigation should be approached.” (Ramazanoğlu & \nHolland 2002: 11) \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n24 \n \npositions are diverse, one primary uniting factor of feminist research is “...the engendering of \ntransformations of scientific and scholarly production” (143). Another important distinguishing \nfactor of feminist research the centring of oneself amongst the division and debate and to \nestablish a claim of being a feminist researcher (Ramazanoğlu & Holland 2002: 146). I thus \nposition myself and stake my claim as a feminist researcher, and this thesis as feminist research.  \n \n4.2. “Ethico-onto-epistem-ology”: epistemological, ontological, ethical and methodo-\nlogical beginnings  \nAs discussed above, on a general level I follow Barad’s (2007, 2003) claim that ethics, ontology \nand epistemology are interwoven - leading her to coin the portmanteau ‘ethico-onto-epistem-\nology’ (2007: 185 as cited in Lykke 2010: 159). However, for the sake of reader clarity, I will \ndiscuss in turn my ethical, ontological and epistemological starting points, and how this reflects \nupon the methodological course and methods decided upon in this research. \n \n4.2.1. Epistemology \nWithin feminist research there is no singular or universal epistemology. However, the feminist \nepistemological field intersects and is in dialogue with many different theories, strands of \nthought and debates in ways that are varied and non-linear -i.e. not developing over time, but \nrather running in parallel to one another (Harding 1986; Lykke 2010). Simultaneously, one can \ndiscern imbrication and ‘shared starting points’ between these varied epistemological positions \n(Lykke 2010). There is overlap mainly because the ‘axiom’ -basic assumption or principle- of \nfeminist researchers is that of “... the interconnectedness of context and knower…” (128), \nwhich remains attentive to the position of the researcher and the researched.  \n \nThis overlap is also reflected in my own research. I am firmly materialist, but do not hold \ncompletely to a standpoint/ strong objectivity theory (Harding 1991; Smith 2005) or \nintersectional epistemology (Crenshaw 1991). Rather, within this research I come from a \nposthumanist perspective, strongly influenced by various stands of thought, such as: the work \nof Braidotti (2013, 2006), who has been discussed extensively already, but chapter the I will \ndiscuss the methodological ramifications of her theories; Puar and Deleuze & Guattari’s \nconcept of ‘Assemblage’ (Puar 2005, 2012; Deleuze and Guattari 1987); as I have elaborated \non in theory chapter; Haraway’s concept of ‘situated knowledges’ (1988, 1991) and Barad’s \n‘agential realism’ (2003, 2007). I will discuss these theories in due course. Indeed, I align my \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n25 \n \nmethodologies most strongly with what Lykke (2010) calls ‘feminist postconstructionists’ or \n‘corpomaterialists’, but what I understand primarily as new materialist/ posthumanist.  \n \n4.2.2. Methodology \nFollowing Lykke’s call for methodological plurality (Lykke 2010: 161), I am utilising a range \nof theories to inform the methodological outline of this thesis: Barad’s ‘agential realism’, and \nHaraway’s concepts of ‘site’ and ‘sight’ and situated knowledges. As you can see, these are \nsimilar stances to those outlined in my ‘epistemological’ sub-chapter (4.2.1.). This may be \nbecause one’s epistemological beginnings have distinct repercussions for research, as Lykke \n(2010) suggests that “... different epistemological positions have different implications in terms \nof methodologies and methods” (145). This is also in line with Barad’s (2007) concept of \n‘ethico-onto-epistem-ology’, which binds together the epistemological, the ethical and the \nontological. \n \nTo elaborate on this point further, Barad’s (2007) establishment as a ‘New Materialist’ \ntheorist12 arises with her concept of ‘agential realism’, which argues that there is no a priori \nseparation or boundary between what Lykke (2010) calls the ‘researcher subject’ and the \n‘object of research’. Instead “...they [the researcher subject/ object of research] are always to \nbe considered as parts of the same world and reality and involved in continuous intra-actions \nwith each other” (151). On the other hand however, a defined boundary between the two is \nimportant to conduct research. This understanding has had a significant impact on my \nmethodology. It has enabled me to acknowledge that the researcher subject and object of \nresearch are in intra-action with each other but that both need to be ‘delimited’ -which is to say \ndefined- and put into context (Barad 2003; 2007). At the same time, however, the relationship \nbetween both is defined but always under the understanding that it is unfixed, unstable and \nmomentary (Barad 2007; Lykke 2010: 151).  \n \nThe knowledge that is created from this relationship between the subject researcher and object \nof research is inherently partial, context specific, or, as Braidotti (2013) puts it ‘embodied and \nembedded’. The idea of these situated -embodied and embedded- knowledges is exemplified \nin Haraway’s (1988) tools of ‘siting’ and ‘sighting’. ‘Site’ and ‘sight’ are two aspects of \n‘situatedness’ within the theory of situated knowledges. Methodologically speaking, this means \n                                                                \n12 See the work of van der Tuin (2014) for a more thorough overview of New Materialism \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n26 \n \nto enact ‘siting’ on the one hand, which is the edict for a researcher be reflexive about their \nsituatedness and context, and ‘sighting’ on the other, which is to visibilise the research \ntechnologies/ apparatuses which ‘reconfigure spacetimematter’ (Barad 2007: 142), or in other \nwords ‘construct’ the object of research (Lykke 2010: 152). This methods and methodology \nchapter in all its detail is an effort towards enacting both ‘site’ and ‘sight’ methodologies, but \nit also part of an endeavour to engage in reflexive thought throughout this entire thesis. \n \nAlthough we as researchers are to be reflexive regarding our situation and context, research \nshould still be ‘objective’, but not in the traditional understanding, but rather only as within the \ncontext of the situated research. Indeed, Haraway (1991, 1988) understands the historical \nspecificity of what is generally considered “objective” science, without deconstructing and \ninvalidating scientific knowledge and the possibility of objectivity. Haraway instead fosters an \nunderstanding of objectivity that is based in critical thought and reflexivity - what she calls \n‘feminist critical empiricism’. The basis of feminist critical empiricism is the end to the \ndichotomy of constructivism versus objectivism and instead the creation of “partial, locatable, \ncritical knowledges sustaining the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity in \npolitics and shared conversations in epistemology” (Haraway 1988: 584). These knowledges \nare embodied and strictly located and they acknowledge not only these standpoints, but also \nthe limits to them.  \n \nSimilarly to Barad, Haraway (1991) emphasises that ‘situated knowledges’ build in \naccountability by emphasising moral responsibility/ accountability as researcher’s for our \ninterpretation of reality and that “Situated knowledges are always marked knowledges; they \nare re-markings, reorientatings [sic], of the great maps that globalized and the heterogeneous \nbody of the world in the history of masculinist capitalism and colonialism” (111, original \nemphasis). Barad’s ‘agential realism’ incorporates an ‘ethics of knowing’ (1996: 183 in Lykke \n2010: 159), where ontology, epistemology and ethics are all bound together. \n \nAs a recap, the concepts of agential realism (Barad 2007), ‘site’ and ‘sight’ and situated \nknowledges (Haraway 1988), are of particular methodological importance to this research, and \nthey have enabled me to construct this research in the terms that I have. They also provide an \nimportant ethical perspective, which will be discussed in section 4.2.4. Moreover, I contend \nthat ‘matter-realist’ methodologies (Braidotti 2013, Lykke 2010) have been especially \ninfluential for this research, which can be evidenced by the research questions and aims which \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n27 \n \nconsider an explicitly empirical case, and by the focus I have provided on the material during \nthe analysis of this empirical material. \n \n4.2.3. Ontology \nMy ontological understanding is based upon the supposition that bodies are materially there/ \nhere, but also discursively formulated. For instance, following Barad’s concept of ‘agential \nrealism’ (which is discussed above), specifically as it can be seen as in dialogue with Butler’s \nBodies that Matter (1993) means that we can see how “… on the one hand, the performativity \nof discourses shaped bodily matter, but, on the other hand, following Barad’s argument, it \nimplies that bodily matter, moreover, should be understood as performatively acting in and of \nitself” (Lykke 2010: 121). In this understanding, the material and the discursive are ‘conjoined’ \n(Barad 2003: 823). Moreover Lykke (2010), discussing Braidotti (2013, 2006) and Grosz \n(1994), argues that both are “...taking a starting point in the body and bodily differences and to \nsee these as an unavoidable ontological basis [...] is in no way equivalent to an essentialist \nfixing of categories”. This is because the body is not static, unitary but rather a process (Lykke \n2010: 150). \n \nThus my ontological understandings begin from here, and a declaration that bodies do matter, \nthey are matter. Materialistically, we exist, although we are mediated through discourse (as \ndiscussed above Lykke 2010 and Barad 2003). Moreover, following Braidotti (2013), I \nemphasise a posthuman understanding of life (Zoë), the interconnectedness of all Life, that we \nare collections of matter (water, bacteria and so on) are embodied and embedded into context, \nintimately connected effective/affective towards Life. \n \n4.2.4. Ethics \nI understand that ethics are intimately bound with the process of research, and that being \naccountable to the ‘objects of research’ for my interpretation of reality is one space where I can \nenact my ethical obligations (Haraway 1991). Additionally to this is the ethical imperative to \nacknowledge my partiality, situatedness, and to visibilise (through ‘site’ and ‘sight’) the \n(always partial) situation of myself as the researcher and the tools I use (Ibid). This ethical \nimperative has impacted on this thesis in numerous ways, including influencing me to situate \nmyself within the text of this research using personal pronouns, rather than retaining detached, \nneutral language (something that was deemed necessary during my earlier academic career). \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n28 \n \nThere is also an understanding that I -as researcher- and the objects of research are defined and \nplaced into context with one another. This is true irrespective of the objects of research - in my \ncase the authors of the autobiographical texts within Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011). This \nis because although my empirical material is a secondary analysis of texts, it is clear that I and \nthe authors of these texts are still to be “…considered as parts of the same world and reality \nand involved in continuous intra-actions with each other” (Lykke 2010: 151). I am interpreting \nand representing these autobiographical accounts whilst remaining aware that I as a researcher \nam not similarly positioned, since I do not identify as Asian or Pacific American, and have \nlittle experience of American culture beyond that which I have seen in the media. Thus, I strive \nto represent these authors in ways that are respectful (such as refusing to alter the pronouns and \nself-descriptions they have used in-text), and remain aware of the privileges that both I as \nresearcher have for being able to conduct this research, and that these authors have had to be \nable to broadcast their narratives in this anthology. \n \n4.3. Methods \nIn order to better examine the intersection between posthuman theory, the subject and activism, \nan empirical case was decided upon. This will allow me, as a researcher into this topic, to \n‘narrow’ down my field of vision, and to ‘embody’ and ‘embedded’ what can be rather \nphilosophical discussions of subjectivity onto a real life case. \n \nBoth secondary literature and primary data collection via interviews were considered as options \nresearch into my chosen topic. Initially, I had planned to conduct semi-structured interviews \nwith volunteers and activists within an organisation in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, for \nvarious reasons, I was unable to realise both the quality and quantity of interviews that I had \nplanned. Happily however, I came across the anthology Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of \nQueer Asian/ Pacific American Activists (Kumashiro 2011) and could see immediately that it \nwas an excellent source of reflections on ideas of the subject and activism and decided that I \nwould conduct an analysis of the autobiographical texts within Restoried Selves. \n \n4.3.1 Participants \nThe ‘participants’ or ‘objects of research’, to continue Lykke’s (2010) coinage, in this research \nare all contributors to the anthology Restoried Selves: Autobiographies of Queer Asian/ Pacific \nAmerican Activists (Kumashiro 2011). Their autobiographical texts and poetry, which reflects \non their identities, activism and life story, will be a useful resource to help explore the \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n29 \n \nintersection between posthuman theory, subjectivity and activism. There is a great degree of \nvariability with regards to these author’s racial/ethnic/national identification, gender/sex \nidentification and sexuality identification, and their status as either ‘insider’ or ‘outsider’ \nactivists (Browne & Bakshi 2013) but nonetheless they have submitted their chapters to this \nanthology, indicating that they -at least in some sense- relate to the terms Queer, Asian/ Pacific \nAmerican and Activist. The authors, in order of their chapters, are as follows: \n1. Pabitra Benjamin \n2. Nur-e-alam S. Chisty \n3. Lance Collins \n4. Roland Sintos Coloma \n5. Alain Anh-Tuan Dang \n6. Wei Ming Dariotis \n7. TC Duong  \n8. Loren R. Javier \n9. Kevin K. Kumashiro \n10. David C. Lee \n11. Jeanette Mei Gim Lee \n12. Cristina M. Misa \n13. Pauline Park \n14. k. terumi shorb \n15. Wendy M. Thompson \n16. “You Yun” \n17. Helen Zia \nThere is scant information regarding how these contributors were selected for this anthology. \nWithin the preface and acknowledgements of Restoried Selves, editor Kumashiro (2011) \nasserts that “Queer Asian/Pacific Americans who engage in various forms of antioppressive \nactivism have come together to share their autobiographies” (xxiii) and that “Many activists \nwrote autobiographies that could not be included in this volume…” (xxvii) This would indicate \nthat the authors submitted texts to this anthology, rather than being interviewed. The varying \nstyles, forms and content between the texts in addition to the fact that these texts are all written \nin the first person would further indicate that these are texts that have been submitted and \naccepted by the editor. However, from this, one cannot see how these particular authors were \nchosen as contributors to this anthology, how their contributions were formed and how or if \ntheir contributions were edited.  \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n30 \n \n \nWithin the preface we can see that the aim of this anthology is to contribute to the body of \nLGBTQ APA activist literature (xxiv). This is done by creating new counter representations of \nLGBTQ APA individuals, who have traditionally been misrepresented or overlooked in both \nAPA and LGBTQ communities within the wider social context both historically as well as \ncontemporaneously (xxiii).  \n \nIn the United States of America13, the location within which this anthology is sited, there has \nbeen a hugely polarised debate regarding LGBTQ rights. On the one hand, there have been \nrecent shifts towards increasing these social rights, such as legalising the adoption of children \nby same-sex couples, and a recognition of marriage between same-sex couples, both of which \nhave been enacted nationwide in 2015. However, the backlash to these recent rulings has been \nimmense and forms part of a wider push-back against and rescinding of LGBTQ rights both in \nthe USA and around the world (Schneider 2014). Although these precise rulings are more \nrecent than this anthology, the debates regarding LGBTQ rights have a wider historical context \nand so it is worth bearing these in mind when reading these autobiographical texts. \n \n4.3.2. Overview of Research Process \nI am using a case study research design. This kind of research design hopes to explore the \nphenomena of subjectivity, and, it is intended, opens up avenues to explore posthumanist \nconceptions of self. Moreover, as discussed above, Feminist methodologies will shape the kind \nof inquiry, the steps and the data analysis in the following ways. As a feminist researcher, \nfeminist methodologies also inform my general worldview, which is inseparable from the \nresearch I conduct and thus the “final narrative” of this research. \n \nFor a description of the research process itself:  \n1. First, I conducted a general reading of all autobiographical accounts within the \nRestoried Selves anthology; \n2. Secondly, I conducted a specific read through of the text, gathering “variable type” \ninformation under nodes in NVivo; \n                                                                \n13 For brevity I will only discuss here the debates as they have occurred within the USA. However, similar \ndebates have been occurring elsewhere in the world, at the same time as LGBTQ/ Human rights have been \nrescinded in other parts of the world e.g. Russia, Uganda and to a lesser extent Kenya, India and Nigeria.  \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n31 \n \n3. Thirdly, I conducted an in-depth, line by line analysis of the text, annotating as well as \nmaking note of keywords and themes within NVivo; \n4. After this in-depth read through, both the text and the annotations were read through to \ngenerate initial ‘nodes’ for coding in NVivo. These nodes were created from themes \nfound within the text, as well as certain posthuman themes (posthuman approaches to \nsubjectivity, posthuman approaches to activism). \nThere was clearly a large degree of imbrication between these nodes, this is the reason I have \nallowed for double coding. From the annotations, and from a further read through, nodes/codes \nwere grouped together, and the ‘main’ or ‘most important’ codes emerged, creating categories \nor themes. \n \n4.3.3. Overview of data analysis \nAs previously discussed, I am using agential realism and situated knowledges as part of my \nanalytical strategy (Lykke 2010: 150). Moreover, I am using posthuman theories, specifically \nposthuman theories of the subject, as part of the theoretical and methodological background to \nthis thesis. My analysis intends to explore whether there are indicators of posthuman thought \nwithin these autobiographical texts and I am thus ‘reading into’ the data with these theories in \nmind. One could argue that what I am doing is inherently positivist, which is, having a theory \nand testing it with the data obtained, as opposed to a qualitative, constructivist or grounded \ntheory approach whereby one has data and attempts to extract theory from it. However, my \nanalysis seeks not so much to “test” posthuman theory, but rather seeks to explore phenomena \nof subjectivity and activism through the lens of posthuman theory and in the process explore \nposthuman theory itself. I am, however, attempting to complete a ‘holistic’ view of the data, \nbearing in mind my essentially partial knowledge and worldview. But by ‘holistic’ I mean \nconsidering the setting for the data, and that analysis involves “... multiple elements and factors \nat the same time.” (Bazeley 2013: 27). \n \nRestoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011) has created text based data for me, in the form of \nautobiographical writing and poetry from 17 LGBTQ identified Asian and Pacific Islander \nactivists. The primary tool that I have used for my thesis project is NVivo, specifically ‘NVivo \n10’. Unlike for quantitative data analysis, where the use of computer software is commonplace, \nthere are concerns levied towards the use of computer assisted qualitative data analysis \nsoftware (CAQDAS) such as NVivo. Bryman (2012) outlines several of these concerns, which \ninclude: CAQDAS being hard grasp; concerns regarding fragmenting or decontextualising of \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n32 \n \nones data and loss of narrative flow; that CAQDAS are unworkable in a group research project; \nand the argument that CAQDAS is based in grounded theory which may not be compatible to \nall research (592-3). These concerns have been very valuable when considering whether or not \nto use NVivo software (particularly concerns regarding the possible fragmentation or \ndecontextualisation of my data), but like Bryman, I decided that for this particular data and \nwithin the scope of this particular project, using a CAQDAS was worthwhile (593). I have used \nNVivo to: \n store data (document copy of Restoried Selves; my notes on the data (book) \n ‘code’ this data via ‘nodes’ \n keep ‘variable-type’ information, should it exist within the text (such as gender \nidentification, sexuality identification, national/racial/’belonging’ identification) \n maintain records of all of the above for transparency (Bazeley & Jackson 2013: 23) \nHowever, contrary to the recommendations of Bazeley and Jackson (Ibid), I have been unable \nto use NVivo as part of this development of this research project, including the research \nquestion, theoretical background and so on. I have only been able to use NVivo for the analysis \nof this thesis. This is due to an assortment of practical issues, such as: finding computer tools \ninefficient at understanding or helping me to conceptualise my thoughts regarding the topics \nof posthumanism, subjectivity and activism. Rather, I used brainstorming techniques. Thus \ninstead of using NVivo as recommended, my earlier ‘mapping’, ‘journaling’ and topic \nexplorations were conducted via physical rather than electronic means. \n \nCoding in NVivo has be conducted through a ‘slicing’ of the text - applying multiple codes to \na single passage of text, slicing indicates that the researcher subject will take a ‘layered’ view, \nseeing the data in terms of category rather than document (Bazeley & Jackson 2013: 74-5). In \nline with my research question, I have not completed a ‘grounded theory’ analysis (which is to \nsay, looking from the ‘ground up’ in the data), but as I am looking to understand in what ways, \nif any, critical posthuman theory can be used to understand the subjectivity of those who \nengage in political or identity based activism, this means that I have ‘looked into’ the text with \ncertain themes already in mind, without attempting to ‘generate’ data. Nonetheless, conducting \nthe analysis involved a significant, in-depth reading of the texts to ‘bring out’ other themes that \nemerge from the data, more broadly to begin with, and afterwards in a more refined ways, and \nin ways directly related to the research question. \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n33 \n \n \n5. Analysis \nMy research aim is to explore the intersection between the subject, activism and posthuman \ntheory. As described in the methodology section, my analysis will centre around the 17 \nautobiographical accounts that are in the anthology Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011), \nexploring how these self-identified activists understand and describe their subjectivities and \nprocess of subjectification, as well as the motivations for and reflections on their activism. \nSimultaneously, I have analysed their autobiographical texts with a framing of posthuman \ntheories of subjectivity, to identify whether posthuman theory can be used to understand the \nsubjectivities of activists. I consider, then, that I have both been ‘reading into’ and ‘reading \nfrom’ the data simultaneously - whilst remaining critically aware of the dangers of generating \ndata or putting words into the mouths of these authors all the while. This is in line with my \nresearch questions, which are as follows: \n1. Can posthumanist theory be used to understand the subjectivities of activists within \ntheir embodied and embedded locations? Especially considering activists within \npolitical organisations geared toward “social power”.  \n2. How do activists within identity based organisations or associations understand and \nexplain their own subjectivities? \n \nHowever, it should be reiterated at this point that I am not ‘testing’ either posthuman theory or \nthe authors of these autobiographical accounts, but I am rather exploring how and if posthuman \nunderstandings and framings of the individual can adequately describe the subjectivity of those \nwho engage in identity based political activism. Thus, I have attempted to refrain from \ngenerating hypotheses about whether posthuman theory will ‘work’ in these contexts. \n \n5.1. Main themes \nCertain themes have emerged from the text, which will be discussed in turn. Below I will \ndescribe these themes and describe their interconnection or divergence and analyse the impact \nof these findings on my research. \n \nAs Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011) is subtitled Autobiographies of Queer Asian/ Pacific \nAmerican Activists, it is somewhat unsurprisingly very rich in reflections about being an Asian \nand/or Pacific American, LGBT and/or Queer identified activist. During my analysis of these \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n34 \n \ntexts, it became increasingly clear that these authors discuss extensively their subjectivities and \nprocesses of subjectification, and how this is related to their activism and in some cases their \nidentity as activists. There is a deal of interconnection between the themes that arise in these \ntexts, but I have noticed that this imbrication is particularly strong with the themes of activism \nand identity.  \n \nDuring this analysis chapter I will describe my main findings from these texts, assessing the \ntopics of identity and activism separately in so far as they are distinct, but will describe the \noverlap and connections between these categories when appropriate. Each of these sub-\ncategorisations reveal the facets of activism or identity that these authors have conveyed the \nimportance of: building up knowledge of their processes of subjectification; the background to \ntheir activism; the reasons for their activism; and the people whom they do their activism for. \nMoreover, this analysis will recurrently refer to the theoretical underpinnings of this thesis, \ninsofar as they impact on the research aims and questions that I am exploring. These theories \ninclude: posthuman approaches to subjectivity; theories of subjectivity and agency; \nAssemblage theory; social movement theory; and posthuman approaches to activism. \n \n5.2. Posthuman reflections \nThis research has focused on exploring how and if posthuman understandings and framings of \nthe individual can adequately describe the subjectivity of those who engage in identity based \npolitical activism. This the autobiographical texts in Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2013) have \nbeen analysed with a framing centred on posthuman theories of subjectivity. The primary \naspects of posthuman subjectivities that I have been looking for have been focused on whether \nthe identity, subjectivities and subjectification/ identification processes coincide with \nposthumanist understandings and theorisations on the self. While the topic of posthuman \nsubjectivities has been uncovered in depth in section 3.1. of this thesis, very briefly, I have \nbeen looking for an indication that these authors link themselves, or their activism, to wider \ncommunities, to the wider world -the ‘environment’, Zoë (Braidotti 2013) or Life. Moreover, \nunderstandings of relationality, connection to others and care of or for others would be an \nindication of posthumanist-like understandings of self, and positionality in the world. \n \n5.2.1. Recognition of partial perspective \nIn many of these texts, there was reflection on the idea of the self as inherently partial, or having \na partial perspective. The term partial in these contexts indicates that the self is existing in part, \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n35 \n \nand is either incomplete or not ‘whole’ (and not in the process of becoming whole), which \nindicates a shift away from Humanist conceptions of the self which is understood as complete, \nor on route to becoming ‘complete’. The idea of partial perspective was shown most clearly in \nrelation to reflections on the autobiographical account itself - authors such as Wei Ming and \nKevin K. recognised as constructed the autobiographical account as inherently partial, as there \nare aspects that are shown and aspects that are not:  \n“I begin to question my presumptuousness of telling a story about me in my youth. \nThere is no way to tell a story that captures the whole of experience. Any story I tell is \nonly one reading of me in my youth. Can I tell “my” story in ways that address the \ncomplexities of who I was while making explicit that, even when doing so, my story \ncannot help but be a partial story? Can I tell my story in ways that invite the readers of \nmy story to reflect on different ways of reading this story and on the insights and \nknowledges and emotions and changes that each reading makes possible as well as \nimpossible?” (Kevin K.)  \nHere Kevin K. is expressing that the autobiographical account is situated in particular time and \nplace. Moreover, the reader as well as the writer are positioned and partial in front of the \naccount. Again, this is an inherently partial account – within the context of this format \n(autobiographical texts, each being around 10-15 pages long) there is no way to portray a life \nin its entirety. Indeed, it is even asserted that there are multiple ways of looking, or ‘readings’ \nat the same context. Within the methodology and theory section, I have analysed at length the \nimportance of partial perspective to posthuman understandings (Haraway 1991, 1988; Braidotti \n2013), which understands that to be embodied and embedded within a politics of location is \nfundamentally partial, this is an expression of posthuman subjectivity (Braidotti 2013: 49) \n \n5.2.2. To be embodied and embedded \nRelated to the idea of having a partial perspective is a recognition of the importance of being \npart of communities, and understanding the self as contextual and relational. Using Braidotti’s \n(2013) terminology, I suggest that these reflections are about being ‘embodied’ and \n‘embedded’. For instance, Wei Ming, Wendy M., Pauline and k. terumi shorb all discuss how \ntheir physical -embodied- selves acts as a confrontation, a confusion or a challenge to binary \nunderstandings of the self (specifically in these cases in terms of race and/or sexuality and/or \ngender). For instance, when reflecting on her activism Wei Ming states that:  \n“... sometimes it is the presence of my body, queer and hapa, that is making the \nstatement.”  \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n36 \n \nThe notion of embodied experience is aligned with the material self within, k. terumi shorb’s \nchapter, which discusses their activism, self-presentation and self-understanding that rejects \nbinaries, but asserts that s/he still creates space for truth claims and a recognition of material \nexperiences and conditions. Pauline’s embodied experiences, while rather different to k. terumi \nshorb’s, still emphasises throughout her autobiographical account the importance of her \nembodied self, and the relation of her body to her activist work. She details several instances \n(being the only transgendered person in one organisation, prompting the renaming of a ‘Gay \nand Lesbian centre’ to be a centre for ‘LGBT communities’; prompting the bylaws and mission \nstatements of the Out People of Color Political Action Club and the Gay Asian & Pacific \nIslander Men of New York to become more explicitly trans* inclusive), explicitly stating that \nher embodied “difference” as a transgendered person of colour and Korean adoptee has been \nsignificant in affecting these changes. \n \n5.2.3. Emphasis on connection to and care for others \nIn certain author’s narratives, there was an explicit reference to the author seeing themselves \nin connection to others, and as embedded in relationships of care to others. For instance Alain \nemphasises that his activist work can only enact change through his working relation to others. \nAdditionally to Alain, Wei Ming asserts that she “wouldn’t exist” without the support of her \ncommunities. Wei Ming further indicates that identities are not only personal (something one \n‘has’) but they are also ‘enacted’ -they are performed and embodied. She argues that she \nrequires the support of her communities just as the community requires support from her, and \nthus she is indicating that she is embedded in a relationship of care. Just as k. terumi shorb and \nWendy M., who understand that the narratives that they build (as discussed above) are for and \npart of a wider community of people, based in their own experiences of invisibilisation or \nessentialisation/ racist representation within the media or within their communities. These \npositions would seemingly indicate a feminist posthuman ethics as defined by Åsberg and \nNeimanis (2013) and a posthuman subjectivity as defined by Braidotti (2013), however, I \nwould argue that they do not. The primary reason for this is that these understandings of \nconnection and care for others extends mainly to similar others, such as those with similar \nsubject positionings as APA and/or LGBTQ. For instance, part of Loren R.’s engagement in is \norder to “…create role models and decrease stereotypes so that the journey isn’t so bumpy … \n[for] … queer Asian Americans”. Similarly, Alain engages in activism hoping to enact change \nfor “queer youth buried deep in the closet”, and Lance fights colonialism for his “peoples”, \narguing that “We need our own ways to understand our desires, our communities”. I am not \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n37 \n \naiming to diminish the value of these author’s activism, or to portray them as selfish for \nengaging in the activism that they do. Indeed, as we will discuss in due course, there is dire \nneed for creating alternative representations of LGBTQ APA people. Rather, I am seeking to \nunderstand whether posthuman approaches to subjectivity can be compatible with these \nactivists’ understandings and assertions of their own subjectivities, and in this regard, I \nunderstand that these authors’ assertions do not accord with posthuman theories of subjectivity. \nThe solitary exception to this approach is within the text of Wei Ming, who states that: \n“Now I understand that becoming a bi bi grrrl, a bisexual hapa feminist, is a process of \nenacting my identities. It isn't just about me and how I see myself or how I ask others \nto see me. It's also about being a part of communities. I wouldn't exist without my \ncommunities to support me, so I need to support them. My communities include my \nfamily. My communities include people I may not at first see as being like me. My job \nis to recognize our connections and to create them, and to encourage the same from \nothers.” (Wei Ming) \nWei Ming’s account is significant in this regard, primarily because it perceives of community \nas consisting of similar and dissimilar others. \n \n5.3. Humanist framings \nI have previously analysed the conceptions of agency put forward by theorists such as Butler \n(1993, 1997, 2005) and Mahmood (2005), arguing that concepts of the social and power are \ncentral to Humanist understandings of agency and subjectivity. At the same time, it is important \nnot assume that all agents are inhabiting an inherently resistive, individual mode of being. In \naddition to these postmodern and postcolonial modes of seeing the self, I have also discussed \nclassical Humanist notions of the self, which positions the self as part of a mind/body duality, \npositioning oneself as separate from nature and repeating notions of Otherness. \n \nAs asserted above, within Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011) there is a lot reflection upon the \nindividuals’ processes of subjectification in these autobiographical texts. I argue that \nsubjectivity and agency are primarily seen through Humanist lenses in several key ways, such \nas reflecting on life as a process of becoming a ‘true self’ and emphasising how the lack of \nrepresentation (of LGBTQ APA people) has affected their processes of self-identification, \ndelaying the discovery and/ or articulation of their ‘true self’. \n \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n38 \n \n5.3.1. Identity as a process of becoming \nMany of these narratives contain a discourse of identity as a process, occurring over time. \nIndeed, Alain talks about his “... long process of personal identity formation”. The notion of \nidentity as a process is found in particular relation to coming out narratives. For example \nPauline relays her narrative of first coming out as gay, and later as transgendered. \n \nWithin the narrative of identity as a process, however, I could see, repeated again and again, \nthat there is an implicit assumption that there is a ‘true self’ is which is discovered, uncovered or \narticulated as part of a process of “becoming”. To provide a selection of the many examples \nfrom the many found in these texts: \n“People are either straight or gay, I thought. Not until college did I find a name for my \nqueer desires, and not until then did I come out to myself or to others as bisexual.” \n(Kevin K.) \n“Just remember, no matter what you do, you can’t escape who you truly are.” (David \nC.) \n“Perhaps I had always been a bisexual; I just never knew the “correct” term.” (Roland) \n“Growing up in an evangelical Protestant household with devoutly Lutheran parents \nand grandparents, I realized instinctively that I could not be who I truly was until I \nreached adulthood…” (Pauline) \nI argue that this theme, that of the “true self” relates strongly to the discourses of discovery \nwhich discuss how identification relies on representation the self in similar others (this point \nwill be elaborated on in section 5.3.2.). Indeed, classical humanist understandings of the self \nposit that there is a true self beyond and above the embodied self, which is the “mind” or “soul” \nof Cartesian mind/ body dualism (Descartes 1972; Federici 2004). This is a self that is being \nrepeated here. Although posthuman ontologies understand the material realities of bodies, these \nmaterial embodied self, however this is a self that is discursively formulated, but no classical \n“self” as it is understood above. The self is rather relational, always partial and contextual. \n \n5.3.2. Importance of representation in subjectification and identification \nMany of the autobiographical texts discussed the issue of representation, or rather lack of \nrepresentation. This lack of representation was shown to affect these authors’ processes of self-\nidentification, leading in some accounts to (initial) self ‘misidentification’ and in others, to \ndelaying the discovery and/ or articulation of their ‘true self’, as discussed above. \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n39 \n \nLack of representation can be from within communities or social milieu. For instance, Nur-e-\nalam S. discusses: \n“Fearing rejection, especially having witnessed quotidian homophobia in both my \nAsian and my “American” communities, I felt once again left to cope with my \nconfusion alone. I remember thinking that I was the only queer male of color living in \nthis world.” \nThese problems of representation were also described as within the media too. In these \naccounts, media representations of Asian and/or Pacific Americans do not go beyond the \n'surface’ or the stereotypical, leading either to misrepresentation or to essentialised \nrepresentations (or else outright invisibilisation, as Cristina M. describes). In other accounts, \nthe emphasis was that LGBTQ and/or APA people were depicted in stereotypical and racist \nways (David C.; Loren R). For these authors, the lack of representation presented a serious \nproblem, in that they could not accept themselves as simultaneously racialised (as APA) and \nsexualised (as LGBTQ) because of a lack of representations of those who are simultaneously \nqueer and Asian LGBTQ individuals. For instance, Loren R. explores how his self-identity was \naffected by lack of media representations of Asian American LGBTQ people:  \n“In fact, I didn't see any Filipino American, let alone Asian American, gay person on \ntelevision or in the movies. I would tell myself, “only white men can be gay”.”  \nLance and David C. both discuss this problem was not contained within the mainstream media, \nbut also how LGBTQ can erase or essentialise of people of colour. These representations either \nrepresent APA people as ‘exotic’ and ‘sexualised’ others’ (Lance) or, as David C. writes: \n“White male bodies are sprawled across magazines, tabloids, billboards, gay TV, \nmovies, and gay clubs. Asians are rendered invisible in the gay community—and yeah, \nit's like a racial slur.” \nThese accounts show the need for ‘role models’ to actualize identities, and emphasise that \nmedia representations are important, and not trivial to one’s sense of self – especially since \nthey are shown to open up space for multiple identity formations. Consequently, in many \nnarratives, a source of activism for these authors was to “broadcast narratives” (David C.) of \ntheir lives as dual/ multiply identified people, and to forge their own representations. \nBroadcasting narratives was seen as important in two ways; both as a source of personal power \n- a claiming of one’s own agency (Wendy M.) but also creating narratives to help similarly \npeople (LGBTQ APA) forge their own identities (k. terumi shorb; David C.; Loren R.; Helen). \nAs David C. Lee so elegantly puts it: \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n40 \n \n“We as people of color must broadcast our narratives. We must speak out for ourselves \nbecause we will be disappointed if we always rely on others to speak for us. Our \nnarratives make us visible.” \nThis once again generates the perception that the authors of these texts understand themselves \nin primarily Humanistic ways, because it positions their subjectification process as on the path \nof becoming a “true self”, hindered by lack of representations, leading to misidentification and \ndelaying the discovery and/ or articulation of their ‘true self’. \n \n5.3.3. “Double, not just half” - dual or multiple identities \nAlthough the authors have hugely different identifications, family backgrounds and childhood \nexperiences, nearly universal in these texts was a reflection upon being dual or multiply \nidentified. For most, there was a process of ‘coming to terms with’ or actualizing dual or \nmultiple identities, for example: \n“I had been so caught up in feeling not-Chinese that I couldn't comprehend the \npossibility of being Chinese-and-something. So things really changed for me in college. \nI started to understand that I could be “Asian American.” [....]. To begin to see myself \nas Chinese American in a positive sense, I had to accept that my European heritage was \npart of who I am; who I am is both of these things, double, not just half.” (Wei Ming) \nThere was also defiance and a declaration of pride in multiple or dual identities, especially in \nthe face of those who demand that they pick a ‘side’ (either to choose to accentuate a single \nracial identification over another, or to emphasise racial or sexual identifications, depending \non the instance). For example:  \n“Living in a constant state of negotiation between my Samoan and Mexican families, I \ncame to understand being biracial as having identities to respect and own rather than \nhaving to show loyalty toward only one.” (Cristina M. Lisa) \nThese accounts emphasise that it is possible to be multiple identified and to show/ assemble \nparticular –partial- aspects of the self in certain settings. Moreover, within these accounts, an \nimportant recurring theme was a desire for a recognition of difference, and the ability to have \ntheir dual/ multiple identities recognised, without essentialisation or tokenisation. There was \nalso a discussion of finding a space where these identities can be shown or lived at the same \ntime, rather than having to compartmentalize/ disguise/ minimize one part of the self (for \ninstance, a repeated theme through these texts is having to downplay LGBT identity when in \nAPA groups, or play down racialised identity within LGBT groups - this will be discussed \nbelow). These are spaces that seem to be sought out or created, rather than ‘found’. \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n41 \n \n“What is so powerful about being in any queer people of color space is that I don't have \nto choose which part of my identity to leave behind. My identities are all a part of me \neven though I am often asked to leave some or all of them behind. By creating such \nspaces and developing allies, I hope that AAPI people and people of color will never \nhave to leave their identities behind.” (TC Duong) \nAnother interesting point to consider is that in these texts there is a focus on intersectionality, \nas described by Crenshaw (1991). Intersectionality in these texts are both mutually supporting \noppressions, as well as identity intersections. For instance, Loren R., Kevin K., Jeanette, k. \nterumi shorb and Wei Ming all explicitly utilise the term “intersection” or “intersectionality” \nin their autobiographical texts. Moreover, the notion of dual or multiple identities \nacknowledges that while intersecting with one another, identities are nonetheless categories \nwhich can be separated and disassembled, although of course this is not preferable to most of \nthe authors who seek to find spaces where their multiple identifications can cohere, and there \nis no expectation or demand to minimise or disguise one or more aspects of the self. Pauline is \na notable exception to this, as she argues that: \n“… I am invariably “the other” in any group that I’m in, whether it be the only openly \ntransgendered woman or the only Asian in an LGBT organization, the only \nLGBT/queer person in an Asian American organization, or the only adoptee in an API \ngroup. However, in an age of identity politics, such difference is not necessarily a bad \nthing, and instead can be used to enhance inclusivity and diversity.” \nThus, she draws attention to her difference (including in physical ways, see above) in order to \naffect change. \n \nThese accounts thus seem to refute Assemblage theory understandings of the self. As a \nreminder, an assemblage is the culmination -or bringing together- of tactile economies within \none space/ time, which is not even necessarily localised on human bodies (Puar 2012: 57), \ntactile economies are more ontological than epistemological as they highlight touch, sensation \netc. – basically material things (Puar 2005: 134). The Intersectionality discussed by these \nauthors emphasizes the intersection between identity as well as (possibly but not necessarily \nmaterial) oppressions, and do not emphasise tactile economies. \n \n5.4. Approaches to activism \nWhile again, these authors have hugely different identifications, family backgrounds and \nchildhood experiences, their approaches to activism generally supports the assertion of Sörbom \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n42 \n \nand Wennerhag (2013) that “Politics is always undertaken in relation to an imagined collective \nor on the basis of collective values” (472). As I have already discussed, to a large (but by no \nmeans universal) extent within these texts, this ‘imagined collective’ is comprised of similarly \nidentified others. \n \nThe notion of an imagined collective constituted both the described motivation for engaging in \nactivism, as well as the purpose (and imagined beneficiaries) of activism for these authors. The \nimagined collective also constitutes the background support though which activism is \nconsidered possible. For example, Kevin K. expresses that “Engaging in activism requires \nsupport. And ideas. And love” and that these things are provided to him by his close friends \nand fellow activists. \n \nNotably, Alain indicates that the primary impetus for his activism is his own “personal struggle \nin accepting his queer identity” and that: \n“That is the conclusion I have come to in assessing my life. I fight oppression as a \nmeans to fight my own oppression.” \nHowever this seems to be a minority expression, as more often than not, these authors affirmed \nthat they engaged in activism for others –albeit similarly identified others– within the paradigm \nof the ‘imagined collective’. Within this, though, motivations for activism often mirrored the \nfindings from section 5.3.2., emphasising the importance of representation in subjectification \nand identification. For instance David C., Kevin K., Loren R., Nur-e-alam S., Wendy M., \nCristina M., k. terumi shorb and Helen all explicitly disclosed that increasing and improving \nrepresentations (both within communities and within the media) would help others ‘like them’ \nwith their journeys to proper self-identification, whilst at the same time noting that there were \nno such representations when they were growing up and coming out into the world. \n \n5.5. Conclusion to analysis chapter \nIn this chapter, I have presented the main themes from Restoried Selves (Kumashiro 2011), and \ndiscussed the analysis of these themes, which have included: \n Posthuman facets of activism and identity; connection and care for others; embodied \nand embedded; partial perspective; \n Humanist facets of activism and identity; “true self”, and the importance of \nrepresentation to identification, dual or multiple identities; \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n43 \n \n Reflections on intersectionality, assemblage and activism.  \nI have also compared my data with that the data and standpoints expressed by other academics, \nconsidering points of similarity and difference, especially considering whether my findings are \nconsistent with the theoretical standpoints taken in this thesis. From these starting points, I will \ngenerate a reply to my research questions. \n \n6. Discussion \nThroughout my research, my aims along with my questions have been guiding the research \nprocess. For the discussion chapter, I will examine my research aims and questions and analyse \nhow the data has helped to respond to them. After this I will discuss my data and identify the \nthemes that have developed though the analysis of this data. Through this, I will assess the \npotential significance or impact of these themes in line with the theoretical positions outlined \nearlier in this thesis. \n \nMy aims have been to: explore posthuman theoretical approaches to subjectivity: during the \ntheory chapter of this thesis, I have explored posthuman theoretical approaches to subjectivity. \nDuring the analysis chapter, I have expanded on these theoretical affirmations with my own \nanalysis, which indicates the ways in which the authors of the autobiographical accounts do or \ndo not uphold these theoretical approaches. Another aim of mine has been to explore the \nintersection between the subject, activism, and posthuman theory: during the theoretical, \nmethodological chapters of this thesis, I have explored these intersections extensively, and will \ncontinue to expand on these themes below. Finally, I have aimed to see if activists understand \ntheir subjectivity in posthuman ways: as the analysis chapter has shown, there are no explicit \nindications that these activists describe or understand their subjectivity in such ways. However, \nI would rather suppose that one could understand that aspects of their descriptions of their \nsubjectivities as posthuman, rather than seeing that these activists themselves understand their \nsubjectivities in posthuman ways. Following a discussion of my research aims, I will now \nexplore my research questions, and consider how these questions have been resolved. \n \n6.1. Reflection on analysis findings \nOne can certainly see that aspects of posthuman theory can be used to understand the \nsubjectivity of those who engage in identity based, political activism, especially when focusing \non embodied experiences (especially with regard to racial discrimination, denigration and \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n44 \n \nhomophobia) and on ‘partial perspective’ - a recognition and understanding that not only are \nthe autobiographical accounts themselves partial from the perspective of the author, but also \nembedded and understood in the context of the reader. \n \nHowever, it seems clear that these authors do not explicitly utilise posthuman theories of the \nself when describing their own subjectivities. Instead, in these texts there is a focus on the \nintersection of multiple identity categories (Crenshaw 1991). Intersectionality in these texts \ndescribes both mutually supporting oppressions and identity intersections. Moreover, the \nnotion of dual or multiple identities acknowledges that while intersecting with one another, \nidentities are nonetheless comprised of categories which can be separated and disassembled. \nThe intersectionality discussed by these authors emphasises the intersection between identity \nas well as (possibly but not necessarily material) oppressions, and do not emphasise tactile \neconomies or an Assemblage based understanding of identity or subjectivity (Puar 2005).  \n \nThus, I conclude that posthuman theories of subjectivity, by and large, cannot be used to \ncompletely understand the subjectivity of those who engage in identity based activism, at least \nwithin the scope of this thesis and the autobiographical texts considered here. This is because \nthe authors here have not described their subjectivities, identity formation and activism within \nposthuman framings, but also because they understand themselves in largely humanistic ways. \nPosthumanism has theoretical understandings of what subjectivity is or can be within a \nposthuman world – a world that we are already said to be living in (after all, we are already \nsaid to be living in posthuman times, we are already cyborgs according to Haraway 1991, \n2013), but these understandings do not figure largely in the lives of these particular activists. \nHowever posthuman theory cannot adequately explain, or, more accurately, does not feature \nas a framing reference for these authors in several key ways.  \n \nFirstly, posthumanist theorists wish to investigate the meanings of posthuman bodies while \nremaining attentive embodied to experiences and oppressions as they are within the often \nuniversalising ventures of technology. However, within these autobiographical accounts, the \nauthors do not -by and large- attempt to reconfigure individualist conceptions of agency and \nselfhood, or attempt to create understandings that suggest that all bodies are interconnected. \nThere is an understanding promoted by some authors that focuses on the importance of \ncommunities to a sense of self which emphasises that the individual by themselves cannot \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n45 \n \naffect change. However, these accounts do not go so far as to suggest interconnection and inter-\nreliance on all earth others, such as the environment or non-human animals. \n \nFollowing on from this, within these autobiographical accounts, it is clear that these authors do \nnot emphasise, as some posthuman theorists do, that posthuman selves are embedded in \naffectivity, practices of care and concern for others. For instance, when Åsberg and Neimanis \n(2013) argue that “....engagement is key to feminist posthuman ethics; concerns for alterity and \ncare for others is prior to selfhood” (Ibid: 21), this means that this new ontology of bodies is \ncontesting the binaries on which the Enlightenment Man claims a sense of self – which is as \ndistinctly individual, as separate to and above ‘nature’. Within these accounts, there is a large \ndegree of care for others; but to the extent that these others are placed above the self is not \nevident within the text. Moreover, while concerns for alterity (which is, a state of otherness/ \ndifference) are evidenced more widely within the text, these concerns are not limitless, and are \nalmost exclusively discussed in terms of what I have called ‘similar others’ -most usually \nLGBTQ APA identified people. \n \nFurthermore there is also no indication in the data that posthuman theory can be used to \nunderstand the subjectivity of those who engage in identity based political activism. Some of \nthe authors’ texts that have been analysed display acknowledgement of partial perspective, \nwhich is shown most clearly in relation to reflections on the autobiographical account itself, \nspecifically declaring the autobiographical account as constructed and thus inherently partial. \nMoreover, reflections on the centrality of embodied and embedded experiences describe how \nthe physical embodied self can act as a confrontation, a confusion or a challenge to binary \nunderstandings of self (in terms of race and/or sexuality and/or gender). This would seemingly \nindicate that posthumanist understandings of the subject –as partial, interconnected, inherently \nreliant on others and above all embodied and embedded (Braidotti 2013, Haraway, 1991)- are \nbeing reiterated and underlined. However, on reflection, I assert that these accounts largely \nestablish the importance of the embodied self to activism, rather than to a sense of self. This \nbecause an embodied self is primarily discussed in relation to ones activism in these accounts. \nOne exception to this is k. terumi shorb, who discusses her/his embodiment in relation to both \ntheir activism and sense of self, since it is her/his masculine presenting but feminine identified \nbody which in and of itself acts as a confrontation or challenge to heteronormative and cis-\nsexist normativity and thus is a source of her/his activism.  \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n46 \n \nWhen analysing these accounts, I have found that the assertion of Sörbom and Wennerhag \n(2013), that activism is always conducted with an imagined collective on the basis of collective \nvalues is almost universally repeated. Not only has the notion of an imagined collective \nconstituted both the motivation for engaging in activism, as well as the purpose (and imagined \nbeneficiaries) of activism, the imagined collective also constitutes the background support/ \ncommunity though which activism is considered possible. Thus I maintain that although these \nactivists, ostensibly engaging in individualised “life politics” nonetheless both understand their \nactivism through and are motivated to engage in activism through a real or imagined collective.  \n \nConversely, when returning to the assertions of Papadopoulos (2010), we can see that within \nthese texts there was little focus on ‘matter’, which he argues is the key to making left politics \nmore posthumanist. However, I am rather conflicted on this point. For instance, I argue that \nthese authors’ focus on enhancing or increasing representations of LGBTQ APA people, which \nis ostensibly an ‘immaterial’ endeavour, will as an impact lead to material change in people’s \nlives. Perhaps being able to “come to terms” with the ‘true self’ can be important to the material \nrealities of those who are depressed, or feel ashamed of who they are or what they want to be. \nPerhaps this shows that I understand the ‘material’ in a fundamentally different way to \nPapadopoulos? Or rather, perhaps it is because these activists do not focus exclusively, or even \nprimarily on changing material conditions that precludes them from Papadopoulos’ \nunderstanding of what makes a left posthuman gesture. \n \nAnother aspect of Papadopoulos’ (2010) argument to ‘make the left more posthuman again, \nand vice versa’ is to promoting ‘alter-ontologies’, or making new/different forms of life \npossible. Here is where I can certainly see parallels between Papadopoulos’ theories and the \naccounts of these activists. I argue that universally in these authors’ texts is a desire to create a \nspace for themselves and similar others. This could indicate that while, by and large, these \nauthors do not understand their subjectivities in posthuman ways -they do not use posthuman \nunderstandings nor do they for the most part indicate that their subjectivities adhere to a \nposthuman framing of subjectivity- perhaps it is their actions that speak most loudly to a \nposthuman understanding of activism, at least insofar as it is promoted by Papadopoulos. \nHowever within other theorisations of posthuman activism such as Åsberg and Neimanis’ \n(2013) feminist posthuman ethics, the authors of these autobiographical accounts do not seem \nto indicate adherence to these standards (see above). \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n47 \n \n7. Conclusion \nThis research has sought to explore the intersection between the subject, activism, and \nposthuman theory and has determined that self-identified activists do not seem to explicitly \nunderstand themselves as posthuman subjects, but that in some ways, a posthuman framing can \nimplicitly be attributed to these subjects and their activism. This research has also set out to \ninvestigate whether posthuman theoretical understandings of the subject can be applied to \ncontemporaneous subjects. \n \nThe general theoretical literature indicates that questions of posthuman subjectivity heighten \nthe need to focus on political action, however, theoretical models regarding subjectivities and \nactivism have overtaken empirical analysis of real life activist subjects. It is within this context \nthat I have asked: \n1. Can posthumanist theory be used to understand the subjectivities of activists? \nEspecially considering activists within political organisations or associations geared \ntoward “social power” or “life politics”. \n2. How do activists within identity based organisations or associations understand and \nexplain their own subjectivities? \nThe remainder of this chapter will firstly provide a synthesis of empirical finding as answers \nto research questions, then analyse the theoretical implications of this thesis. Finally I will \nconsider the future direction and direction of further research. \n \n7.1. Synthesis of empirical findings \nWhen considered broadly, this research has uncovered several interesting insights into the \nsubjectivities of activists that engage in so called “identity politics” or “social power” oriented \norganisations.  For instance, the important emphasis that these authors placed on the ‘imagined \ncollective’, which provided both a motivation for engaging in activism and a source of support \nfor activists, enabled activists to position themselves within a framework of connection and \ncare for others.  \n \nMoreover, since I hadn’t hypothesised how these activists would understand themselves, only \nseeking to understand whether they utilised posthuman understandings, it was interesting to \nme to uncover just how important humanist understandings (such as the ‘true self’) were to \nthese authors. This is shown especially with discussions regarding representation which \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n48 \n \nindicated how the representation of similar others, both within communities and within the \nmedia, is very important in the process of becoming the ‘true self’. Additionally, it was \nnoteworthy that the impetus create representations, or to be representational of LGBTQ APA \npeople formed a significant motivation for some of these authors. Linked to this is the notion \nof embodiment, and the relation of embodiment to representation and activism. This is \nimportant as it shows a link between the material and that which is usually considered \nintangible (self-understanding, subjectivities and self-representation). \n \nWithin the analysis and discussion chapters, I have explored multiple facets within the broad \ntopics of posthuman theory, the subject and activism. The overall conclusions that I have drawn \nare that: first and foremost, posthuman theory can only be used in a limited way to understand \nthe subjectivities of activists, and that secondly, these subjects do not describe themselves in \nposthuman terms, and even rather in many cases seem to understand themselves in explicitly \nhumanist terms. \n \n7.2. Theoretical implications of this thesis \nAs I have discovered that contemporary activists form a subjectivity that is radically different \nfrom posthuman theory’s approaches to subjectivity and to activism I conclude that overall, \nwithin wider posthuman theory, and for posthuman theorists, this research could act as a site \nof reflection. More specifically, as posthuman theory of the subject focuses on embodied and \nembedded experiences, these “real life” accounts should be useful, as a starting point to create \nalternative theorizations of the self. Even though some posthuman theorists are primarily \nmapping out a proposed theory of the subject (Åsberg & Neimanis 2013, for example), the \nanalysis here may be useful, for instance, to fully understand the starting point from which to \nunderstand and investigate the contemporary subject. Since my research begins from the \nontological understanding that the material body the starting point for all research but \nsimultaneously acknowledging that these bodies are mediated through discourse (Lykke 2010; \nBarad 2003). From here, I have constructed my ‘ethico-onto-epistem-ology’ explicitly in order \nto explore the intersection between the posthuman, subjectivity and activism. Thus, I consider \nthat I have contributed methodologically to posthuman theory, by providing a framework -for \nposthuman theorists or those wishing to explore posthuman theory- to be able to conduct \nempirical research into similar issues.  \n \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n49 \n \nAside from the theoretical implications for posthuman theory, this thesis also has relevance for \nsocial movement theory and Assemblage theory. For example, the emphasis in these authors’ \naccounts on their ‘imagined community’ reinforce the theoretical assertions of Sörbom and \nWennerhag (2013). Additionally since these activists do not focus exclusively, or even \nprimarily on changing material conditions, this precludes them from Papadopoulos’ (2010) \nunderstanding of what makes a left posthuman gesture.  Indeed in some ways, the findings \ndiscussed here reinforces Papadopoulos’ claim that contemporary political organisations are \nfocused on ‘social power’ which has also been termed “identity politics” or else ‘life politics’ \n(following Sörbom & Wennerhag 2013), and are thus incompatible with posthuman politics \nand organisations, which centre the material and ‘alter-ontologies’ (Papadopoulos 2010: 144-\n5). However, I have asserted that, on reflection, these authors’ focus on enhancing or increasing \nrepresentations of LGBTQ APA people, which is ostensibly an ‘immaterial’ endeavour, could \nlead to material change in people’s lives, thus opening up a space for posthuman politics within \nthe very organisations that Papadopoulos claims cannot become posthuman. \n \n7.3. Future direction and direction of further research \nI feel that this research can be valuable in several ways, such as: embedding posthuman \nresearch in the so-called “real word”, taking it from the realm of theory and applying it to \nmaterial human subjects; understanding whether or not posthuman theory can be used to \nunderstand their subjectivity and subjectification processes; exploring whether these activists \nunderstand themselves in posthuman ways, or using posthuman framings (even if these \nframings are not specifically mentioned); and using methodology appropriate to the subject, \nwhilst creating a well thought through methodological framework that can be utilised by future \nsocial researchers. \n \nIt is within this framework that I would like to suggest recommendations for future research. \nThese are avenues that have not been explored during this research project, but would be \ninteresting to investigate in the near future. These suggestions include:  \n Conducting similar research, utilising similar methodologies, but within different \nactivist groups, such as groups that could be considered as not necessarily identity \nbased, such as environmental or animal rights groups. This would enable the researcher \nto understand any similarities or differences between the subjectivities and processes \nof subjectification within these groups. \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n50 \n \n Collecting and analysing primary data on the same topic of LGBT APA activists - this \nwould enable future researchers to probe activists more directly with questions about \nposthumanism; for instance to explore what remains unanswered in this thesis that is \nwhether these authors had heard of or understood posthuman theory. Given that \nposthuman theory does not currently have widespread currency, this may have affected \nthe autobiographical accounts and the reflections contained therein. For instance, the \naccounts may have been demonstrably more “posthuman” is the authors had been \nexposed to posthuman theory, but that is simply conjecture without further research to \nexplore it. \n \n7.3.1. Delimitations \nAs a direct consequence of this thesis’ methodology, the study encountered a number of \nlimitations, which need to be considered. For instance, conducting a secondary data analysis \nrather than collecting primary data of course limits me as researcher to the data that is available. \nHowever in some ways researching with secondary data has also be seen as beneficial since it \nhas allowed me to analyse potentially a greater volume of in depth texts than may have been \npossible to obtain given the constraints of this research. \n \n7.4. Concluding thoughts \nThe world is indeed undergoing significant transformations. And posthumanism offers \ninteresting theoretical insights into the concepts of the subject and activism within this rapidly \nand radically changing world. But posthuman theorists need to stretch beyond the theoretical \nin order to truly realise its aims. To be instrumental in opening up alternative avenues through \nwhich we can comprehend the subject, activism and identity, posthuman theory needs to take \ninto account personal understandings of the self. \n \n \n  \nEXPLORING POSTHUMAN SUBJECTIVITIES \n51 \n \nReferences \nBarad, Karen (1996).
