The Trump administration is bolstering its efforts to tighten the legal definition of gender under federal law which would put the protection of the transgender community at risk, The New York Times reported on Monday. In a leaked memo obtained by The New York times, it was discovered that the Department of Health and Human Services will launch a crackdown on how federal programs recognize gender through an attempt to define it “on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.” This legal definition will be placed under the jurisdiction of Title IX, a federal civil rights law that restricts discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs as well as programs that receive federal funding. The action would roll back efforts made during the Obama administration to broaden legal concepts of gender in education and health care.Under former President Obama, a “Dear Colleague” letter – an official correspondenceRulings may limit gender identitiesBy Winona RajamohanSTAFF WRITERGENDER| Page 2The San Jose State University community had a conversation about the quality of humanity and its implication to current social issues with American writer Shaun King and other San Jose community leaders on Wednesday evening in the Student Union Ballroom.King is a civil rights activist who gained prominence on social media after his writing on the Black Lives Matter movement. Before getting involved in civil rights activism, he was a historian. He presented the evolution of humanity and applied that to issues happening in the current era.In the 19th century, German histor ian Leopold von Ranke, who pioneered the creation of a college degree program in the study of history, created the first anecdotal timeline in human history by collecting thousands upon thousands of human stories.“He thought when he put all of these stories in chronological order, it would show him human beings were getting better over time,” King said.However, people did not improve steadily over time. The chronological chart showed peaks and troughs of the quality of humanity.“We are now in the dip of the quality of humanity,” King said. “It’s easy to get in the dip but hard to get out of the dip.” King presented the data of United States and federal prison population from 1925 through 2014 and the international rates of imprisonment, illustrating the high record of prison populations in the past two decades have made it rank first internationally in terms of the imprisonment rate.“Right now, the U.S. has more people in prison than any country in the history of the world,” King said. He explained that the U.S. is exceeding Rwanda in the imprisonment rate, the country that just escaped from genocide, “Basically, we have a genocidal level of imprisonment,” he said.King stated that though the steadily rising graph Rally for trans inclusionBy Huan XunSTAFF WRITERSUGIYAMAACTIVISM | Page 2NORA RAMIREZ | SPARTAN DAILYRonan Beltracchi creates a poster to carry for the rally in front of City Hall on Wednesday.NATIONAL POLICYNEWSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, OCT. 25, 20182San Jose State University students boiled, chopped and learned how to make wonton soup during CHEW, a cook-ing workshop, in the Wellness Center on Wednesday. CHEW, which stands for cooking healthy, eating well, was featured once more as an event for the second annual Health and Wellness week hosted by SJSU’s Wellness Center. The week of events includ-ed speakers, workshops and various activities for students centered around their physical and mental well-being.According to the col-lege’s website, the Health and Wellness Week, highlight[s] College of Human and Health Sciences’ strong commitment to creating a culture of wellness on campus and throughout the community. The class was full, with 18 students eager to learn how to make wonton soup. They happily rolled out the wonton wrappers and waited for them to boil, before enjoying them at the end of the class.Three instructors, includ-ing Ashley Chang, let students know about health resources on campus, including dieti-tian Cassie Barmore, before demonstrating how to prep and make wonton soup. Follow Myla on Twitter@mylalabine25Follow Nora on Twitter@noraramirez2Chang prepped ground chicken and fresh ingredients were laid for students to cut and put into their soup. She also explained kitchen safety, as students were going to be working with knives. She demonstrated while the other two instructors walked around the room to see if stu-dents needed help.Chang believes that cooking is important to health because you get to control what goes into your food. Chang also shared that she thinks it’s ben-eficial to students because it can serve as a stress reliever.“It can bring [the] commu-nity together, so that can help with being more mindful and letting go,” she said.Fellow instructor Kim Da Silva also reiterated how cooking can be a valuable and important tool for students.“I think learning how to cook is one of the biggest first steps anyone can implement before  actually beginning to incorporating healthy foods into their diet,” Da Silva said.Lisa Szczepaniak, another instructor, shared the same sentiment. “I feel like CHEW being part of Health and Wellness week is a really fantastic addition because your health begins with what you put in your body,” Szczepaniak said. She, and Da Silva, both hope CHEW is included again during Health and Wellness week next year. Public health sophomore Kaela Nguyen attended the CHEW class after hearing about it from her department. Nguyen said she had attend-ed classes before, but men-tionaed she wanted to attend Wednesday’s session specifi-cally in honor of Health and Wellness week.“I knew about all the events this week, and I knew this was one of them. I think this event is so cool,” Nguyen said. “I meet a lot of new people at CHEW. It’s fun, it’s just an hour where you can just kind of relax, take a deep breath, and make good food,” she said.Undeclared freshman Charitha Posam attended because she was interested in learning how to make some-thing new. “Cooking has been a pas-sion for me and it’s something I love to do,” Posam said. Szczepaniak and Da Silva both hope that CHEW is included in next year’s Health and Wellness week.“[CHEW] is a really fan-tastic program that campus has . . . I think we should be [featured again]. I would do it,” Szczepaniak shared. The College of Health and Human Sciences will continue to hold events through Friday. HUGO VERA | SPARTAN DAILYCHEW Instructor Ashley Chang demonstrates to students how to fold wonton wrappers in the Wellness Center on Wednesday.By Myla La Bine STAFF WRITERPrescription for  better health: foodHall on Wednesday afternoon to fight for trans-inclusion in society. “California is ahead of the game and look what’s happening, we are outraged,” said Billy DeFrank LGBTQ Community Center’s Board President, Gabrielle Antolovich. While the nation seems to be falling behind in LGBTQ recognition, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill this month that allows the state of California Department of Motor Vehicles to give the option to individuals to choose their gender identification on their driver’s license or identification card. Beginning January 1, 2019, the DMV will allow Californians to choose a gender category of male, female or nonbinary on their DL/ID cards.Locally, the Santa Clara County opened an LGBTQ Affairs Office in March, a one-of-its-kind facility in the country.The county is raising the bar high in comparison to the rest of the country serving the judicial issues this community might have. Transgender services program manager, Anthony Ross, shared that the county’s office is always available for anyone at any time.“Let us know what you need, we’re here for you,” said Ross said at the city hall rally. People cheered, clapped and cried as allies and volunteers shared their personal stories. “Our existence is not debatable by anybody,” Ross said.Rally organizer Sera Fernando said to stand strong at the fact that the Trump administration is forcing the most marginalized community of the LGBTQ spectrum out of the system.“I want to communicate to the entire world that trans people will not be erased,” said Fernando.Many community members said it is unfair to have to forcefully choose a gender they don’t identify with. The phrases “we will not be erased” and the spanish word for present, “presente,” were chanted throughout the rally by speakers and attendees. People who drove by honked their car horns to show support for the community and flags were waved. Vice President of the Bay Area Municipal Elections Committee, Paul Escobar, talked about Adam Spickler who was the first openly trans men official to be elected into office in California’s state history. Spickler was automatically appointed to the position of Cabrillo College trustee in Santa Cruz County earlier in August.“While the Trump administration may want to roll back the clock, we will move forward with purpose and enthusiasm,” Escobar said. He emphasized the importance of voting to continue having an inclusive and progressive state.“Coming together to stand for our values is crucial, and in 14 days we need to go and vote,” he added.ALLIESContinued from page 1did not infer the evolution of humanity, it only showed the improvement of technology. He then asked the crowd to think about the question, “If humanity is getting better and better, how do we explain this?” King said, in order for people to get out from the dip, people should become energized and be organized. After achieving that, “the good news is you are halfway there, the bad news is most of us are stuck at halfway,” he added.He added that improving the quality of humanity also requires a sophisticated plan which is almost as comprehensive as the problem.“I think people in this generation don’t know how to make a change and it’s not only just about being educated on the things that are going on, but also how to organize as a community and implicate those laws and bills,” sociology senior Edith Villanueva said.Though King talked about the evolution of humanity theoretically, a panel discussing local social issues was held. U.S. Representative of California District 17 Ro Khanna, director of LGBTQ Affairs Santa Clara County Maribel Martinez, the co-founder of Silicon Valley De-Bug Raj Jayadev and the leader of California National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Alice Huffman joined King for the panel session.Responding to students’ concerns about expression of defeat regardless of the importance of voting, director of LGBTQ Affairs Santa Clara County Maribel Martinez said, “Voting is one aspect of ways that we can get involved and it is one aspect that is by definition designed to exclude certain voices.Kinesiology senior Takia Tinney said she felt inspired by their talk about the importance of voting. “In the world today, instead of being frustrated and feeling like you can’t do anything, just start with voting,” Tinney said.The community leaders also talked about inequality in specific areas in California. Martinez suggested that informing decision-makers is a way to protect socially vulnerable groups. “Data point, research, intersectionality and engagement stories are so important to the work that we need to do,” she said.ACTIVISMContinued from page 1Follow Huan Xun on Twitter@Huanxun_chandistributed to all congressional offices – to all school districts in May 2016 interpreted Title IX protections to include transgender individuals, NPR reported.In the letter, the terminology of “gender identity” was defined as an “individual’s internal sense of gender” that “may be different from or the same as the person’s assigned sex at birth.”“It’s not discrimination if you don’t exist,” director of the Pride Center and Gender Equity Center, Bonnie Sugiyama said. Sugiyama said members of the community saw this move from the Trump administration coming. Changes were noticed on government websites when applying for passports – limiting language for the transgender community to identify their gender.  “The courts are going to have to decide if the federal government’s definition is a definition that has to be upheld by different states,” Sugiyama said. “California will fight back.” According to The New York Times, the Trump administration’s plans to establish its revised definition of sex would affect proposed rulings currently under review at the White House if courts accept the definition under federal law. The rulings under review are from the Education Department and Department of Health and Human Services. The rulings discuss how federally funded schools and health programs should handle complaints about sex discrimination.The regulations have not been released and are expected to be open for public comment this fall. The CSU campus system follows executive orders based on the “Dear Colleague” letter released by the Obama administration, with the orders encompassing system-wide policies to prohibit all forms of discrimination, harassment and retaliation.“We will follow the CSU campus system’s executive order regardless of what the federal government does,” chief diversity officer Kathleen Wong(Lau) said.The order widens the scope of language used to describe gender, directly referring to the term “transgender” as a form of gender identity.The order also calls for universities to protect individuals on the basis of gender expression and genetic information.“Students or faculty may still feel that there could be an increase of harassment [because of the new proposed legal definition] and these rules do not prevent that from happening, it just gives us the tools to deal with them,” Wong(Lau) said. As a university, more outward displays of support for the transgender community will continue to be encouraged in this time of uncertainty, she added. Wong(Lau) said that new buildings introduced onto campus grounds will be planned to include gender accessible bathrooms, however limitations are present in older buildings as it would require more extensive remodeling.“I think that there’s some simpler solutions that can be done, even if it means that some people are going to have to travel an extra floor to go to the bathroom to make sure that they don’t have to travel to another building to go to the bathroom,” Sugiyama said. “Even simple things like that can be done but it’s a matter of people being willing to do it from an administrative point of view.” Programming from the Pride Center and Gender Equity Center will continue to promote gender identity education on campus and act as resources to validate students and their gender identities.“We are living in very trying times. Every week it seems like something affects a group on our campus in terms of national politics,” Wong(Lau) said. “[The campus] wants to be able to respond, be proactive and be ready, so should any crime or violence occur, we can utilize all the tools we have available.”GENDERContinued from page 1Follow Winona on Twitter@winonaarjmhIn the world today, instead of being frustrated and feeling like you can’t do anything, just start with voting.

To The Movies” as the voice of the Green Lantern. Th e controversial phe-nomenon of “mumble rap” has been a staple of Lil Yachty’s career, as he oft en slurs and mum-bles his lyrics to the point that the words become indecipherable. His latest album “Nut-hin’ 2 Prove” was released on Friday and features additional vocals from household names in the rap game such as Cardi B, Offset and Playboi Carti. The 15-track album fo-cuses on a wide range of topics, from Lil Yachty simply gloating about his own success to dissing ri-val artists such as Drake.Opening tracks such as “Gimmie My Respect” and “Riley From The Boon-docks” establish that Lil Yachty wants to be seen as a stand-alone perform-er whereas before he pro-vided additional lyrics on other artists’ songs.Excerpts from “Riley From The Boondocks” include lyrics such as, “We need more like you / Imma SlimeBall like Nudy / I slang wood like Judy.” “Nudy” is a reference to Lil Yachty’s close friend and collaborator Young Nudy. In 2016, the same year Lil Yachty’s career skyrocketed, Young Nudy collaborated with “mum-ble rap” icon 21 Savage to produce his own mixtape titled “SlimeBall.” The album then aban-dons this sense of broth-erly love with fellow rap-pers in the fifth track, “Yacht Club.” Lyrics in “Yacht Club” include “I’m a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas / But I ain’t on no Drake shit / I won’t get her pregnant.” Following the release of his album “Scorpion,” Drake confirmed that he fathered an illegitimate son with adult film star Sophie Brussaux. Lil Yachty exploits the controversy of this reve-lation at Drake’s expense which is uncanny consid-ering the two have no prior history of feuds. Other songs such as “Who Want the Smoke?” and “Forever World” fea-ture additional rap lyrics and vocals from con-temporaries Cardi B and Trippie Redd. While Cardi B’s lyrics add a feminine flare to “Who Want the Smoke?” there’s already been too many tracks featuring Cardi B in 2018. Cardi B has been featured in Ma-roon 5’s “Girls Like You” and Bad Bunny and J. Balvin’s “I Like It.”No disrespect to Car-di B, but lately it seems as though artists include Cardi B in their songs just to sport the “ft. Cardi B” tagline in their track titles. There IS such a thing as too much Cardi B.Th e rest of the album continues to vary in a pleth-ora of moods and themes. Some songs are not as meaningful as others. In the song, “Everything Good, Everything Right,” Lil Yachty mumbles a series of obscenities to the point that even I still can’t understand the lyrics aft er three listens. Th e second to last track, “Fallin’ In Luv” (ft . Gunna) takes the album in a more sincere direction. Lil Yachty references the iconic stoner-comedy duo Cheech & Chong in his story of young love as told from the perspective of a younger Lil Yachty tran-sitioning into the wealthy mogul he is today. Lil Yachty then ends “Nuthin’ 2 Prove” on a note that’s neither disap-pointing nor impressive, which can best describe this entire album. Th e fi nal song “Stoney” is yet another love story told by Lil Yachty that resolves around smoking marijuana. “Nuthin’ 2 Prove” deliv-ers everything one should expect of the “mumble rap” genre, which isn’t much to start. Most of these tracks are just Lil Yachty repeating phrases such as “Shut that shit off ” to the point of tom-foolery, and that’s typically acceptable for this genre. Personally, I prefer rap songs that entail a political agenda or ones that tell a captivating story. While such qualities are scarce in this album that at times feels like au-dio-diarrhea, “Nuthin’ 2 Prove” is a still worth at least one listen. I soundly believe that Lil Yachty’s best album is yet to come.‘22 July’: more than just a dateBy Nora RamirezSTAFF WRITERFollow Nora on Twitter@noraramirez27“22 July”Rating: \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002Directed by: Paul Greengrass Starring: Anders Danielsen Lie,Jon Øigarden Genre: DramamoviereviewRight-wing extremism encouraged him to com-mit one of Norway’s most ruthless terrorist attacks. Inspired to end multi-cultural immigration, his hate for leftists and the elite class grew. The Netflix original movie “22 July” is a call to social justice and a call to the world. Th e fi lm is based on the Norway attacks from July 2011. Th e bombing of the Prime Minister’s offi  ce at Oslo, Norway’s capital, fol-lowed by the shootings in a summer camp at Utoya Island, about 25 miles east from the capital, are the two opening scenes of the movie.Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 innocent people, mostly “children of the elite” and injured more than 200 people in a bloody exercise inspired by hate.Th e rest of the movie fo-cuses on the aft ermath of the attack with Breivik’s tri-al and a hurt country trying to move forward. Th e attacks and the Norwegians’ lifestyle aft er the incident are depicted in the movie released on Oct. 10 and directed by Paul Greengrass featuring an all-Norwegian cast.Greengrass, a British fi lm-maker and former journal-ist, aimed to send a message through this movie. Th e fi lm examines the atrocious events committed by Breivik. It explicitly shows his moves and killings which can be gruesome for some viewers. In order to depict a hurt country, the movie then focuses on the life of a young survivor and his fi ght to re-cover the life he once had.Th ough the drama is Nor-wegian, the fi lm’s original lan-guage is in English, which was a little questionable. It is not hard to under-stand that the movie wants its audience to make conscious decisions in regards to cur-rent social issues happening around the world.Th e movie not only has English audio, it also has German, Italian, French and Spanish as well. In addition to those audio languages, it also has Simplifi ed Chinese and Traditional Chinese subtitles, making it a fi lm audiences of multiple eth-nicities can watch. In the movie, Breivik nev-er allows his ideals of driving Islam out of Europe to falter. He doesn’t make any eff ort to open his mind to the idea of welcoming immigrants to his country and doesn’t seems to feel guilty or sorry. Ironically, Norwegians unite with immigrants to pre-vent terrorist attacks and give Breivik a fair judicial sentence.Th rough “22 July,” Green-grass aims to open the eyes and minds of anyone who watches the fi lm. Director of “United 93,” “Captain Phillips” and “Bloody Sunday,” Greengrass has aimed to depict terrorist attacks through his dramatic documentaries. Greengrass’ work and ded-ication has earned him vari-ous Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. His latest fi lm will not let him down from earning any awards. Anders Danielsen Lie plays Breivik very well. His acting clearly depicts the mental and social changes Breivik goes through, making it easy for me to understand and feel connected to the fi lm. Lie gets into his character really well that at some point I felt a little scared to see him on the screen. In the fi lm, while Breivik is on trial in the court, everyone present is visibly afraid and hurt by his actions. Howev-er, their pain not only comes from the loved ones they lost, but also from Breivik’s possi-ble sentencing. Th e fi lm made me realize how wicked society is becom-ing and how much eff ort is needed to make it better.women who fought for Mexico’s Independence,” Perez said about the sexualizing of women through costumes.Wearing a hijab as part of a costume can be an insult to Muslims who wear one every day for religious reasons. According to Arabs in America, women and sometimes men, wear a hijab to identify themselves as Muslims and to show devotion to Allah, so wearing one without modesty for Halloween is disrespectful.In a country that is so rich in diversity and cultures, it’s hard to distinguish what is acceptable  from what is wrong to wear. Th is fact links to the topic of privilege. It all comes down to who wears what and for what occasion. To what people think they can wear without knowledge of the culture.For minority groups, it is off ensive when people are doing the borrowing because they enjoy privileges minority groups don’t. For example, it’s alarming when someone with dreadlocks doesn’t get hired because of his or her looks, but a person wearing a dreadlock wig is welcomed at a party. Lingerie shops appro-priate cultures through their costume catalog, and also sexualize wom-en with the costumes they sell, like Native American women.According to the Urban Indian Health Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 94 percent of Native American women living in Seattle have reported having been sexually assaulted at least once in their lifetime.Th e over-sexualization of native women has only resulted in their mistreatment by society. Th e racial discrimination in the U.S. has made justice diffi  cult to achieve and their perpetuation to continue. “Stores are greatly contributing to spread cultural appropriation by selling their “costumes” without ever realizing the mockery they are making of these cultures,” Perez said. Next time you’re choosing a costume for Halloween, think about movie characters, cartoon characters or even public fi gures as possible ideas. Don’t wear clothing you see someone wear oft en. Don’t dehumanize anyone or their culture.OPINIONsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, OCT. 25, 20184My sombrero is not your sombreroWith Halloween around the corner, the topic of cultural appropriation comes into question. According to the Oxford Dictionary, cultural appropriation is “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”People wear anything they fi nd in costume stores without thinking if it is proper or improper. More importantly, it is insulting to see Hallow-een stores selling “cos-tumes” that have cultural value to some people. Minority groups in the United States can feel deeply off ended when they see others wearing their valued clothing, es-pecially if the people ap-propriating the clothing are misbehaving. Th is off ense creates a bad reputation for the minority group, not the person wearing the attire. Civil engineering senior Crysta Perez said, “It’s insulting. Th ey see it as nothing more than a joke. It’s just disgusting.”Perez is Mexican and shared that it angers her when people say they’ll drink in addition to wearing the “costume” as a reference to the stereotype of Mexicans being drunks.Susan Scafi di, author of “Who Owns Culture: Appropriation and Au-thenticity in American Law”, explains cultural appropriation as the ac-tion of “taking elements of someone else’s culture without permission.”Seeing some people use a sombrero or a poncho as part of a costume is exceptionally demeaning because they’re not only wearing it, they’re creating a reputation for the people who signifi cantly wear sombreros and ponchos for cultural purposes.Mexicans, especially indigenous groups, wear this attire on a daily basis to go to work.Perez explains being angered when she sees her cultural clothing being worn without respect.  “Tops are very small and skirts are short.

Holding a protest in the country is almost tagging individuals as the targets for the government. Having an online protest is not effi  cient either because of the censorship.General Secretary Xi Jinping’s ultimate goal is to restore China from the loss of national greatness and achieve the “China Dream” of the country rising international in-fl uence. Th e national ad-ministration comes out with diff erent approach-es to repress the resent-ment of the people.According to P. W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking, the writers for “LikeWar: Th e Weapon-ization of Social Media,” there is a group of about 3 million people who are trained and accred-ited to monitoring and infi ltrating political con-versations on Chinese social media. Th e group is called the “50 Cent Army” and its role is to seed positive things about the Chinese government and comment favorably on the government policies. As a user of one of the country’s largest social media portals, Weibo, I observed that the major media outlets would publish mourning posts during the national memorial days and historical dates for tragic events. A single post such as this would eventually be retweeted and commented by hundreds of thousands of users. Key opinion leaders such as celebrities usually do not promote themselves on that particular day and only retweet the posts to show their patriotism.I believe that there might be a mix of real users and trained users who help in spreading government propaganda among this number of reactions. Nevertheless, I am worried that people in the country would lose critical thinking aft er being exposed to the brainwashing propaganda and kept away from the opposite voices.Behaving appropriately online does not reward the users, however, misbehavior brings a penalty to the individual.In early October, a Chinese live-streaming host was detained fi ve days for singing the national anthem in a “disrespectful” manner during a broadcast to millions of her followers, according to the New York Times.Another live-streaming host outraged public dissent aft er making fun of the Nanjing Massacre during her broadcast, according to Global Times. Her account had been banned by the live-streaming portal and was shunned by the other social media outlets.Th e public outrage showed that it’s not only the state offi  cials who do not allow free speech but ordinary internet users are also being framed in the nationalistic-only mindset. Th e Chinese govern-ment is going to imple-ment the social credit system in the next few years and hopefully it will be in place for about 800 million Chinese in-ternet users by 2020, according to Singer and Brooking.Under that system, all diff erent kinds of online activities will be brought together into a single score of social trustworthiness, ranging from online shopping to playing video games. Th e score will not only aff ect the individual’s online behavior but also the individual’s social network. Th e social credit score of people around the individual is taken into account in hopes that the individual is making a positive infl uence on people around them.Th e government is able to monitor every Chinese internet users. Also, it is a way to train internet users to behave appropriately online in order to get a high score, which in turns will limit the freedom of speech and remove the voice of resentment.It’s unbelievable and scary. I could imagine people living under high surveillance and losing their freedom of speech, but I couldn’t imagine people losing their critical thoughts because they are being exposed to too much propaganda or because they want to fi t in with society and favor the people with power.SPORTSsjsunews.com/spartan_daily THURSDAY, OCT. 25, 20186Arevalo focuses on successful senior yearPHOTO COURTESY OF SJSU ATHLETICSGolf senior Abegail Arevalo ﬁ nishes her swing during the ﬁ nal round of the Stanford Intercollegiate on Oct. 21 where she ﬁ nished in 20th place.By Huan Xun Chan STAFF WRITERGolf senior Abegail Arevalo was only 16 years old when she traveled 7,000 miles from her homeland of Manila, Philippines to the United States in the spring of 2016.  She has played golf for almost her whole life, how-ever, it was different for her playing golf for San Jose State University.“Golf is an individual sport. It’s hard to think that golf can be a team sport,” Arevalo said. She added that it was interest-ing because she wasn’t only playing for herself, but also for her teammates, “It’s like when I get out there, I make sure I wave.”Growing up in a golfing family, in which her father and three elder brothers also played, she started golfing at 2 years old and playing in tour-naments at 5 years old.“Golf is my life,” she said. “It definitely helped me with my confidence in general because playing a sport makes a person more confident and resilient.”This March, Arevalo won her first collegiate tourna-ment at the Mountain View Collegiate in Arizona. “It was memorable because the condition was very hard on the last day, it was very windy,” Arevalo said. “It took me a very long time to win a collegiate tournament.”Six months after her victo-ry, she won another collegiate tournament in the Coeur d’Alene Collegiate.Her head coach Dana Dormann said Arevalo is self-disciplined and has been very focused on what she is trying to accomplish. She takes steps that are necessary to make sure she improves and her score reflects her hard work.“She is unflappable. In pressure situations, she is really excelling,” Dormann said. “That’s a great trait for a golfer to be in that situa-tion because a lot of people can perform when there is nothing on the line, but when there are things on the line, that is when Abegail is really stepping out.” The most important per-son in Arevalo’s life is her father who was also her first coach. He came from a poor family and worked his way out to raise the whole family.Her father taught her not only golf but also life lessons. “He taught me, ‘To be successful, you really have to work hard, there is no short-cut to it, you have to strive.’ That’s how he did it and he is still doing it for the family,” Arevalo said.Arevalo is very close with her three older brothers and her athletic personality is influenced by them.“Now, my brothers do not play golf anymore but this summer one of my broth-ers actually caddied for me,” she said.Though she is the fourth child out of five siblings, Arevalo is very indepen-dent. Golf senior Ysabel Tran has known Arevalo for two years and said Arevalo is very mature and supportive even though she is younger than Tran.During a tournament trip to Colorado, Tran experi-enced her first time seeing the stars clearly. “I was living in Southern California and don’t really get to see stars,” Tran said. “I got so excited and was jumping up and down. She put her hand on me and said, ‘Ysabel, calm down.’ ”Arevalo wasn’t always strong. During her first semester in the U.S., she was very culture shocked. She cried when she missed home and craved Filipino foods when she was homesick.Her favorite Filipino food is sinigang, a sour soup usual-ly cooked with vegetables and meats – either pork, shrimp, or beef – and eaten with rice. “This is my favorite food, I like the pork one, I know how to cook it too,” Arevalo said. Though studying abroad wasn’t in her plan, she was willing to take this oppor-tunity to improve her golfing skills.“All of a sudden, I got an offer. I can’t just say no because it was an honor to receive that offer because not everyone can receive that,” she said. “Playing in my home country, I don’t get to play with one of the best players in the world and one of the best amateurs rather.”Currently, her post-grad-uation plan is to become a professional golf player. She hopes to go back to the Philippines and play for the professional league there.Arevalo said the thing she would miss most about SJSU after graduation is her golf team. “After this, golf is going to be an individual sport again. I am just going to play for myself and my country,” she added.Spartans preach defense as key to fi rst winBy Paul Hang STAFF WRITERThe Spartans’ game against San Diego State University last Saturday resulted in a 16-13 defeat, making it the football team’s sev-enth straight loss of the season.The Spartans now fall to 0-3 in the Mountain West Conference play.The team’s last victo-ry against a conference opponent was a 20-17 win against Wyoming on Nov. 25, 2017. The Spartans have come close to winning against UC Davis, Hawaii and SDSU where the Spartans lost by no more than six points in each one of those games.Head coach Brent Brennan shared his thoughts on the game against SDSU. “I was proud of how our kids fought. Especially coming off from the dis-appointment of Army,” Brennan said.Though he considered the game tough, Brennan said he was proud of the players’ efforts trained by the coaching staffs.In the game against Army West Point, the Spartans were shut out in the second half of the team’s 52-3 loss. SJSU man-aged to get its only three points of the game after a 49-yard field goal kick by Bryce Crawford in the first quarter.Brennan said he’s famil-iar with the Spartans’ competition against the University of Las Vegas, Nevada, and believes the team has a strong offensive ability. “As a team, they look like they’ve done nice job offensively. They’re heavy run-pass option. Their quarterback is a really good player,” Brennan said.The overall series record between the Spartans and the Rebels is in favor of the Spartans with 15-6-1. The Rebels earned their first win in eight meetings against the Spartans last year with 41-13 win in Las Vegas.Freshman defensive line Cade Hall expressed his confidence against the Rebels for this week’s game. “We’re really excited this week. It’s another opportunity to come out and play against a good team at home,” Hall said. “I think we started off the week very well.”Sophomore running back Tyler Nevens is also on board with Hall and hopes they can bring a performance similar to that of their game against Hawaii.“Just playing that good football we’ve been play-ing ever since Hawaii,” Nevens said.The Spartans broke their record of having the longest game with their five overtime, 44-41 NICHOLAS ZAMORA | SPARTAN DAILYThe Spartans defensive line stands tall against the Army oﬀ ensive line during the team’s 52-3 loss on Oct. 13.loss against Hawaii on Sept. 29 since the overtime rule was formed before the 1997 season. The Spartans have yet to win their first match of this season, but Nevens mentioned showing perseverance is key to the journey.“Just being positive through it all. It’s progress you just gotta trust the process,” Nevens said.Currently, the Spartans only have five more conference games to play until the Mountain West Championship.The Spartans will play next against the Rebels on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at CEFCU Stadium.After this, golf is going to be an individual sport again. I am just going to play for myself and my country. Abegail Arevalogolf seniorFollow Huan Xun on Twitter@Huanxun_chanWe’re really excited this week.
