Linking this research gap withthe field of video games as a medium, this study examines video game companiesand their strategic communication e\u0000orts toward LGBTQ+ stakeholders throughcritical discourse analysis with influences of queer theory. With this focus, we aimto identify how video game companies discursively construct queer identities andutilize them for strategic communication. Through the analysis of the social mediaand online discourses surrounding two games with queer inclusion, we show thatqueer branding has an influence on the way strategic communication e\u0000orts areemployed throughout the year, as well as the type of content. Furthermore, weshow that in our selected cases, organizations can successfully align themselveswith their LGBTQ+ stakeholders by having queer inclusion at the core of theirstrategic communication e\u0000orts and authentic organizational practices.KEYWORDSstrategic communication, LGBTQ+ stakeholder, LGBTQ+ representation, indie games,video game communication1. IntroductionThis study explores how video game companies employ strategic communication tofoster LGBTQ+ stakeholder alignment and thereby partake in the creation of public cultureand the construction of queer identities (Hallahan et al., 2007; Ciszek, 2018). To do so,we compare and analyze the communication of Tell Me Why (DONTNOD Entertainment,2020) and Bugsnax (Young Horses, 2020) on social media, as well as their organizationalpractices. By analyzing the strategic communication efforts from the companies’ socialmedia, and then contrasting that to their corporate social responsibility practices targetingLGBTQ+ stakeholders, we attempt to analyze their perceived authenticity to stakeholders.Until a few years ago, queer identities existed not only at the peripheries of mediaproduction and representation but also on the peripheries of communication researchersand practitioners (Edwards and L’Etang, 2013; Tindall, 2013; Thach, 2021). However,through the hard work of LGBTQ+ individuals, this is slowly changing (Ciszek, 2018). Forexample, video games have recently been acknowledged as a medium with worthwhile queerrepresentation, with GLAAD1 introducing the Outstanding Video Game award in 2019(Harvey, 2019).1 GLAAD is an acronym for Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. GLAAD is an Americannon-governmental media monitoring organization.Frontiers inCommunication 01 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710Since discourse occurs as a form of social practice, anexplanation of the concept of strategic communication, as well asrelevant constructs, such as authenticity, public relations, corporatesocial responsibility, and LGBTQ+ stakeholders, is needed. Wealso provide an overview of the socioeconomic situation of theLGBTQ+ market and consumer identity to have the necessarybasis to deconstruct these discursive practices. Finally, to bettercontextualize this for video games, the representation of LGBTQ+identities in the medium is addressed.2. Theoretical frameworkThe scholarship surrounding strategic communication hasbeen expanding ever since the inception of the term in 2007. Still,the definition that Hallahan et al. (2007) put forward in theirarticle remains one of themost influential and largely unchallenged.They summarize the essence of strategic communication asan “organization, defined in its broadest sense, communicatingpurposefully to advance its mission” (p. 4). Other scholars haveoffered expansions of this definition from 2007 but generallyagree that strategic communication is deliberate, purposive, andpersuasive by an organization enacted in the public sphere to reachset goals (Holtzhausen et al., 2021).The term “organization” encompasses not only corporationsand for-profit organizations but also non-profit organizations,activist groups, political parties, and (non)governmentorganizations (Hallahan et al., 2007). Seeking to gain admiration,attention, alignment, affinity, and allegiance from theirstakeholders (Hallahan et al., 2007), organizations use anarray of communication channels for this purpose, includingearned, paid, owned, and shared media (Zerfass et al., 2018).Strategic communication is always a two-way process of messagingand listening, meaning it does not only seek to influence but is alsoinfluenced by a variety of stakeholders, such as other organizations,consumers, and markets (Zerfass et al., 2018).Public relations is, of course, one type of strategiccommunication, and fostering PR can be a balancing act fororganizations having to oscillate between different stakeholdergroups and their interests. Aligning with the LGBTQ+ communityhas been of increasing interest to companies (Champlin and Li,2020). LGBTQ+ issues reflect changes in political, cultural, andeconomic landscapes; therefore, challenging the communicationroutine of organizations (Champlin and Li, 2020).2.1. Public relations with LGBTQ+stakeholdersIn this research, we define public relations as a “flow ofpurposive communication produced on behalf of individuals,formally constituted and informally constituted groups, throughtheir continuous trans-actions with other social entities” (Edwards,2012, p. 21). Public relations as a cultural intermediary is “lacedwith ideological, political, and cultural values and hegemonic,heteronormative assumptions” (Edwards and L’Etang, 2013, p. 42).However, not only are practitioners affected by these values andassumptions but also academics (Tindall, 2013)—with LGBTQ+perspectives having been “effectively written out of research onpublic relations” (Edwards and L’Etang, 2013, pp. 50–51).2.1.1. Corporate social responsibilityExpanding since the mid-20th century, corporateresponsibilities evolved beyond simply maximizing financialreturns and providing services to consumers. Nowadays they alsoencompass catering to the expectations of a variety of differentstakeholders (Carroll, 1999; Zhou, 2021). Companies include theseexpectations because perceived corporate social responsibility(CSR) influences the purchase intention and brand perception ofconsumers (Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006; Wagner et al., 2009).Various and context-specific definitions of CSR are theresult of including stakeholder expectations, though as severalscholars highlight, they all built on the same groundwork (e.g.,Carroll, 1999; Dahlsrud, 2008). All different definitions pointto the same five dimensions: environmental, social, economic,stakeholder, and voluntariness (Dahlsrud, 2008). Hence, advocacyfor, and alignment with the LGBTQ+ community, fall within thedomain of CSR. LGBTQ+ issues are societal issues, and theirsolutions sometimes surpass legal obligations. To appeal to andretain LGBTQ+ stakeholders, organizations position themselvesas socially responsible through initiatives that also need to bestrategically communicated. If stakeholders perceive a divergencebetween CSR communication and organizational practice, meaningcorporations failed to deliver on their promises, it is viewed ascorporate hypocrisy (Wagner et al., 2009). Hence, CSR activitiescan only improve a corporate’s image if those activities areperceived to be authentic or sincere (Yoon et al., 2006).However, genuine commitment to social issues becomesincreasingly difficult for corporations that operate transnationally.In an examination of the video game company BlizzardEntertainment, Venter (2021) found that the corporate strategyprioritized national cultural identities over their full commitmentto supporting the LGBTQ+ community. These inconsistenciescan lead to perceived corporate hypocrisy or inauthenticity,accentuating that “the line between pandering to consumersand social issues and practicing ethical and truly altruistic CSRcan sometimes seem rather blurry” (Venter, 2021, p. 60). Thisis especially due to corporate communication on social mediatransgressing regional boundaries. Still, the existence of “trulyaltruistic” CSR can be contested since corporations in a capitalisticmarket are inherently motivated by financial gain.2.1.2. AuthenticityWhen looking at CSR, it becomes clear that a key aspectof successful public relations, particularly with LGBTQ+stakeholders, is authenticity. Scholars from a variety ofdisciplines have contributed to the understanding of thisconstruct, highlighting its interdisciplinarity. However, there is noagreement on the definition of authenticity, resulting in a varietyof research-specific ones (see Molleda, 2010).Through strategic public relations, organizations highlightspecific aspects to build their corporate personalities. This is inturn analyzed and judged by their stakeholders, with consistencybetween communication and action resulting in perceivedFrontiers inCommunication 02 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710authenticity among stakeholders (Molleda, 2010). Accordingly,the context of authenticity becomes especially significant forrelationships with marginalized stakeholder groups, like LGBTQ+consumers (Ciszek and Pounders, 2020). Incorporating this aspect,Lim et al. conceptualized a scale of perceived organizationalauthenticity (POA):POA with historically marginalized publics [is] the extentto which stakeholders perceive an [organization] to be faithfultoward itself (continuity), true to its stakeholders (credibility),motivated by caring and responsibility (integrity), and able tosupport stakeholders in being true to themselves (symbolism),and representing a diversity of stakeholders and their identities(representativeness). (2022, p. 192 emphasis in original)They surveyed the effect POA has on stakeholder skepticism,brand attitude, and purchase intention. Results indicate thatPOA positively influences brand attitude and purchase intention.Most importantly, POA helps moderate stakeholders’ skepticismtoward LGBTQ+ communication, and, in turn, may strengthen theorganization–stakeholder relationship. Their findings supportedthe assertion of Ciszek (2020) that LGBTQ+ stakeholders arehighly skeptical of LGBTQ+ communication efforts.Due to the increased importance of authenticity in LGBTQ+stakeholder communication, the impact of inauthentic orinconsistent communication and CSR practices can be particularlydetrimental to the organization–stakeholder relationship. Thedemand for authentic communication with LGBTQ+ stakeholders,and holistic support of their community, is not only voiced byqueer consumers (e.g., Freitas et al., 1996; Gudelunas, 2011) butalso recognized by (queer) strategic communication practitioners(Ciszek and Pounders, 2020; Ciszek and Lim, 2021).In this research, authenticity means that strategiccommunication messages are in line with corporate practice.We utilize the POA framework to analyze online discoursesurrounding the two video game companies to see if their corporatepractices are consistent with their strategic communication effortson social media. Through this process, we can observe howthese companies appear authentic in their alignment with theirLGBTQ+ stakeholders.2.1.3. Rainbow washingOrganizations need to “walk the walk” by confirming theircommunication with philosophies and policies that are supportiveof their LGBTQ+ stakeholders (Ciszek and Pounders, 2020).Marketing strategies that aim to take stances in sociopoliticalmovements but diverge from the actual organization’s practiceare summarized under the umbrella term “woke washing”(Vredenburg et al., 2020). When companies co-opt the LGBTQ+movement for economic reasons, it is classified as rainbow washing(Ciszek, 2018; Champlin and Li, 2020). The term rainbow washingis understood as “any practice that vaguely or misleadingly portraysa company’s stance and support for the LGBTQIA∗ community,leading to (financial) exploitation and deception of customers”(Wulf et al., 2022, p. 2). From this exploration of the term and itsorigin, it becomes clear that rainbow washing is a form of strategiccommunication (Ciszek and Pounders, 2020).Due to the knowledge gap on rainbow washing and itseffects (Ciszek, 2018; Johns et al., 2022), scholars build uponfindings of other woke washing practices for their research. Johnset al. (2022) assumed that purchase intention would be affectedby consumer attitudes toward rainbow washing. None of theirhypotheses were supported, interestingly though, they noticed amoderately significant correlation between purchase intention andbrand authenticity. If participants felt that the communicatedgoodwill/CSR of Skittles toward the LGBTQ+ community wasgenuine, they were more willing to purchase Skittles products(Johns et al., 2022). Wulf et al. (2022) conducted two studies on theeffect of vague or concrete support claims on the perceived levelof rainbow washing. They found that the perception of rainbowwashing had negative effects on brand evaluation, meaning thatLGBTQ+ stakeholders are highly skeptical of LGBTQ+ targetedcampaigns since they are a historically marginalized public. Theydemand authentic and holistic organizational support, placinggreat emphasis on consistent organizational communicationthroughout the entire year, not just during Pride Month.Pride Month celebrations in June began to commemoratethe violent altercation between police and LGBTQ+ individualsthat was known as the Stonewall riots (Library of Congress,2021). Most organizations tend to “hop on the bandwagon”and release holiday ads with rainbows and queer symbolism,similar to other major holidays (Christmas and Easter). However,given its history and importance to queer culture, it is onlynatural that the LGBTQ+ community reacts negatively towardcorporations commercializing Pride Month. This is truer whenorganizational practices throughout the year do not align withwhat they are communicating during Pride Month. Overall, itseems that engaging authentically and consistently with LGBTQ+stakeholders may result in a mutually beneficial and long-termrelationship. To further explore how organizations communicatewith this stakeholder group, it is necessary to address the history ofthe LGBTQ+ community as a market and consumer segment.2.2. The LGBTQ+ community as a marketsegmentExactly when this LGBTQ+market niche emerged is contested.Before the 1960s, scholars agree that, while queer-owned businesseswere serving queer patrons, the concept of a gay market niche “wasembryonic at most” (Sender, 2005, p. 25) and remained untargetedby businesses (e.g., Peñaloza, 1996; Branchik, 2002). Followingthe Stonewall riots in 1969 and the subsequent gay liberationmovement, the LGBTQ+ market niche saw increasing visibilityamong the mainstream media and marketers (Gudelunas, 2013).However, in the beginning, advertisements in mainstream mediadid not show explicit queer representation and rather relied on gayiconography to covertly target queer consumers (Peñaloza, 1996;Sender, 2005). Importantly, as Sender (2005) notes, (gay) marketersdid not only market products to the LGBTQ+ community butalso constructed this niche through their marketing activities.Nölke (2018) demonstrates that, while there has been a shifttoward more explicit LGBTQ+ representation in mainstreammedia advertisements, many queer identities remain invisible (e.g.,Frontiers inCommunication 03 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710trans identities). This bias is also visible in consumer and marketresearch on the LGBTQ+ community (Coffin et al., 2019).Recognizing the purchasing power of LGBTQ+ customers,companies seek to appeal to and retain these buyers throughalignment with their values (Ginder and Sang-Eun, 2015).Research has shown that LGBTQ+ individuals are awarethey are being courted for corporate profit, but nonethelessappreciate the gay-friendly attitude of corporations (Tuten,2005; Gudelunas, 2011). Simultaneously, LGBTQ+ consumerscriticize the perpetuated “affluent gay” stereotype and demandgenuine support of their community from corporations (Ciszek,2020; Place et al., 2021). While there are organizations thatvoice support for the LGBTQ+ movement and engage insupporting prosocial corporate practice, there is also inauthenticorganizational communication that merely seeks to capitalize onthe LGBTQ+ community and their “queer dollars” (see Ciszek,2020).2.3. (In)visibility: video games and LGBTQ+representationLGBTQ+ representations in media have changedsignificantly over the past decades, with new media genresand technologies introducing novel opportunities forLGBTQ+ (self-)representation (Gross, 2001; Sender, 2012).Scholars have largely neglected video games as culturalintermediaries, with Seiffert and Nothhaft (2015) statingthat video games “should be considered the ‘missing media’in public relations- and strategic communications-research”(p. 255).Media and communication scholars have analyzed LGBTQ+representation across various types of media, finding that theone-dimensionality of queer identities holds true across mostmedia representations (Gross, 2001; Comeforo, 2013; Nölke,2018). Despite this narrow visibility of identities, representation,in general, seems to be improving (GLAAD, 2021a,c, 2022).In 2019, the 30th GLAAD Media Awards inaugurated thecategory for Outstanding Video Game, acknowledging LGBTQ+representation in this media form and hoping to incentivize afurther increase of LGBTQ+ stories and characters (Harvey, 2019).One important source, which charts and categorizes LGBTQ+inclusion in video games, is the LGBTQ Video Game Archive(lgbtqgamearchive.com), the first scholarly database of queercontent in video games. Using this archive created by AdrienneShaw and her research assistants (Ruberg, 2017; Shaw, 2017),several scholars have analyzed LGBTQ+ representation in videogames. Shaw and Friesem (2016) laid the groundwork for thearchive by categorizing LGBTQ+ content in 351 games, concludingthat this content takes many different forms. To address howLGBTQ+ character representation evolved through the years,Utsch et al. (2017) analyzed 861 video games listed in thearchive. They noted an increase in the representation of LGBTQ+characters over the years and a diversification in the portrayedidentities (ibid). Providing contrasting findings, Shaw et al. (2019)emphasize that the diversification of most LGBTQ+ identitiesremains relatively low, despite an increase in released games.In their research on transgender representation, Thach (2021)found that video game narratives seemed to reflect the real-life understandings of transness over the years, becoming lessstigmatized and including less harmful stereotypes. In addition,they noted that only indie games had trans-centered perspectivesin their narratives (ibid). Building on Sender’s (2012) concentriccircle model of media production, Thach (2021) argues that theproduction of video games operates similarly, with indie gamesoffering more possibilities for queer representation than gamesproduced or published by mid-size or major companies.Including LGBTQ+ representation in any entertainmentproduct can yield negative effects on general consumer segments.Media products with LGBTQ+ inclusion can alienate consumersthat do not hold favorable LGBTQ+ attitudes (Cheng et al., 2023).However, the alienation of these consumers is not part of ourresearch, because we utilize queer theory for our critical discourseanalysis (CDA, see below).3. Research questionsHallahan et al. (2007) emphasize that studying strategiccommunication includes observing how an organization“presents itself in society as a social actor in the creation ofpublic culture and in the discussion of public issues” (p. 27).For a successful organization–stakeholder relationship, it isimportant that organizations recognize the marginalizationhistory of the LGBTQ+ public and employ authentic strategiccommunication, meaning communication should reflect sincereorganizational practices.Since LGBTQ+ alignment and support (communication) arepart of CSR, when these messages are vague or misleading,they are considered rainbow washing. If authenticity is notachieved in the eyes of queer stakeholders, i.e., communicationis not consistent with organizational practices, the relationshipwill be compromised. Research on CSR and rainbow washinghas shown that only consistent and authentic support messagespositively affect the organization–stakeholder relationship (Ciszekand Pounders, 2020; Lim et al., 2022). Hence, for our research, wehave formulated the following research questions:RQ1: How do video games with various queer branding differ intheir strategic communication on social media during Pride Month?RQ1.1: How does this communication compare to off-months?Examining how Pride Month communication differs from off-months allows us to analyze whether video game companies usetheir games to solely position themselves as LGBTQ+ allies forcorporate profit in June, hence, engaging in rainbow washing.Also, the differentiation between video games that includevarious (or different) queer representations gives us anotheropportunity to analyze CSR strategies targeted at different queerstakeholders. We use queer branding to differentiate between howovertly games were positioned as queer. The queer representationin Tell Me Why is strongly intertwined with the narrative, as oneof the main playable characters is a transgender man. Due to thegame being narrative-driven, the experience of this character isheavily incorporated into the game world. On the other hand, theincorporation of queer representation in Bugsnax is not deeplyembedded in the narrative. Queer (non-playable) characters existFrontiers inCommunication 04 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710within the game, but their experiences as queer individuals are notthe focus of the narrative at any point.Authenticity is especially important for marginalized publics,such as LGBTQ+ stakeholders. So, to contextualize our findingsfrom the previous research questions, we examine authenticity onan organizational level, by utilizing Lim et al. (2022) POA scale:RQ2: To what extent is the LGBTQ+ stakeholder alignment onsocial media authentic?To answer this research question, we contextualize the videogame companies’ social media communication within other onlinediscourses (interviews, company websites, etc.). Using the POAscale, we then compare organizational practices to their socialmedia communication to observe whether the brands’ CSRis sincere.4. MethodologyFor this research, the video games Tell Me Why andBugsnax were selected. Both feature queer representation, but withvarying incorporation in their narratives, hence considered asvariously queer branded. The social media accounts on Twitter(Bugsnax (YH Game) [@YoungHorses]., 2022; Tell Me Why[@TellMeWhyGame], 2022a), and Instagram (Tell Me Why[@tellmewhygame], 2022b; Young Horses [@younghorsesgames],2022), as well as supporting organizational communication (e.g.,websites and interviews) were analyzed to answer the RQs.The sampling strategy for this research was non-probabilisticconvenience sampling. Bugsnax and Tell Me Why were chosenbecause they were both released in the same year and nominated forthe GLAADMedia Award for Outstanding Video Game (GLAAD,2021b). While both games were nominated for outstanding queerrepresentation, what also proves interesting for our research is thateven if both games were developed by indie companies, whichprovide a safer space for queer individuals (Thach, 2021), Tell MeWhy is still published by Microsoft. Being a major publisher, thiscould involve different organizational practices. Additionally, thesetwo games were the only ones selected from the GLAAD nomineesfor 2021 because they were the only indie-developed games withinthe adventure game genre, even if they do provide completelydifferent adventure experiences. However, the main reason for ourselection of these games is their difference in queer branding orwhat we use to mean narrative incorporation, which we use tocontrast our results.Tell Me Why is a narrative adventure game developed byDONTNOD Entertainment and published by Xbox Game Studios(a Microsoft division). It follows the twins Alyson and Tyler Ronanas they relive their childhood. The game features two LGBTQ+characters: the protagonist Tyler, a transgender man, and Michael,a queer Tlingit man. Tyler is the first playable trans protagonistfrom a major studio. Since the game is character-driven, thenarrative centers around Tyler’s trans experience. The queer aspectof the narrative is, therefore, central to the game experience andan integral part of the branding. The second game Bugsnax wasdeveloped and published by the independent game studio YoungHorses. It is an adventure game that revolves around catchinghalf-bug half-snack creatures while solving the disappearance ofa missing explorer. The narrative does not center around queernarratives, but there are both a lesbian and a gay couple, as wellas a non-binary character.To analyze the organizational communication and practicesand contextualize them fully, CDA2 informed by queer theoryis utilized. The focus of CDA lies in “the role of discoursein the (re)production and challenge of dominance” (Dijk, 1993,p. 249). The stereotypes and constructed images of queerconsumers and the LGBTQ+ market directly influence the socialcognition of LGBTQ+ individuals, furthering the reproductionof heteronormative dominance. The queer theory centers on theintersection of discourse and identity creation (Jagose, 1997).Therefore, we coded our data by focusing on LGBTQ+ stakeholderidentity, as well as how LGBTQ+ issues were discussed by theorganizations. Furthermore, it was of interest how direct thestrategic communication was about LGBTQ+ identities and issues.The data was collected between November and December2022. Young Horses utilizes one Twitter account for all theircommunication and has posted 3.823 tweets; the first Bugsnaxtweet was published in June 2020. On Instagram, they shared 4posts. Tell Me Why has posted 540 tweets and 100 Instagramposts. While the final sample for RQ1 and RQ1.1 only includesposts that pertain to LGBTQ+ topics, all material was surveyedto provide adequate context. The final sample includes originalposts from the main accounts as well as retweets by the accounts.Retweets were included as they also serve as SC to further LGBTQ+stakeholder alignment. This resulted in a final sample of 15Bugsnax tweets on the Young Horses Twitter account; all theirInstagram posts were excluded. For Tell Me Why, 77 tweets ontheir Twitter account and 9 Instagram posts were included. Thisdisparity in communication is also part of our findings, where onecompany chose to communicate much more concerning LGBTQ+topics than the other. However, to provide context to tweetsaddressing LGBTQ+ stakeholders, the entire corpus of socialmedia communication from both companies was analyzed. Thefinal social media communication sample is used to understandhow the video game branding of the companies influences the waythey strategically communicate with their LGBTQ+ stakeholders.To answer RQ2, the social media sample and further onlinediscourses surrounding the companies, such as interviews, thecompany websites, news articles, and YouTube videos, wereanalyzed using the dimensions of POA (Lim et al., 2022)−23sources for Tell Me Why and eight for Bugsnax. Here, thegoal is to compare organizational practices with their strategiccommunication, to see if they are sincerely aligning with theirLGBTQ+ stakeholders, engaging in real CSR, or participating inrainbow washing.The final codebook used to analyze the data has two majorcodes dealing with RQ1 (LGBTQ+ stakeholder identity andLGBTQ+ Discourse) and RQ2 (Perception of OrganizationalAuthenticity). Most codes were created deductively based on the2 To comply with the principles of CDA, the bias of the researchers andby extent this research should be stated. This work is biased due to themethod utilized and the circumstances under which it was written, whichseeks to deconstruct the LGBTQ+ stakeholder identity and illuminate howorganizations discursively reify these hierarchical constructs.Frontiers inCommunication 05 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710literature review. Subcodes were refined with inductive coding afterthe material was coded for the first time.5. Results5.1. Game production contextLooking at organizational practices, Tell Me Why wasdeveloped by DONTNOD Entertainment and published by XboxGame Studios, which is a division of Microsoft. There are noconclusive numbers on how many queer individuals were partof the production process; however, there are a select few thatcommunicated openly about their involvement. DONTNOD andXbox Game Studios worked closely with two transgender GLAADmembers, Nick Adams, Director of Transgender Representation;and Blair Durkee, Special Consultant for Gaming, ensuring anauthentic trans narrative and character. Adams was consultedregarding the story, dialogue, character design, environmentaldesign, and voice actor casting. Additionally, the voice actor forTyler is August Black who is trans himself. Black was given theopportunity to influence dialogue and aspects of Tyler’s character.With the availability of localized voiceovers for other languages, itwas also revealed that they cast trans-voice actors for all languages.While Young Horses is a smaller development team of ninepeople, there are also no conclusive numbers for the involved queerindividuals. The Creative Director, Kevin Zuhn, is non-binary andthey received additional writing support from Sage Coffey who isalso non-binary. The queer representation in Bugsnax is stronglyinfluenced by their lived experiences as non-binary individuals.The non-binary character Floofty Fizzlebean is voiced by CaseyMongillo, who is also non-binary. At least two other queer peoplewere involved with the game, but it is unclear if they influencedthe writing.5.2. Communication strategyComparing the final analysis reveals that the games differgreatly in their strategic communication on social media. Toassess these differences in communication about LGBTQ+ topics,all posts were first coded and categorized by their publishingdate. While RQ1 and RQ1.1 only differentiate between PrideMonth and off-months, it became clear that it was important toinclude other awareness and visibility days, such as Trans Day ofRemembrance, since they also play a role in public relation effortswith these stakeholders.Tell Me Why posted 77 tweets that pertained to LGBTQ+topics, with less than half during off-months. Of these, 26tweets were posted during Pride Month and 17 were onawareness and visibility dates. A similar distribution pattern canbe observed for their Instagram posts. Instagram, in general,served more as a secondary posting platform, with the materialcentering around game content. Instagram posts mainly pertainto the trans representation within the game. So, Tell Me Whystrategically posted about LGBTQ+ topics during Pride Monthand other LGBTQ+-related days. Most of the content that wasposted during these dates communicated stakeholder alignmentthrough LGBTQ+ support, care, or advocacy. The account oftenurged their community to follow their example and stand upagainst discrimination and anti-trans sentiment. Furthermore,they urged their audience to financially support trans individualsand communities.Tell Me Why platformed other queer games, individuals, anddevelopers throughout the year, which positioned them furtheras an ally. When trans rights were at stake, like the revocationof gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth in Arkansas, theyshared information on the situation and retweeted resources.During PrideMonth 2020, the second queer character was revealed,and in 2021 and 2022, the gamewasmade available for free for PrideMonth. By making the game available for free, they were askingtheir community to spend their money on trans and queer charitiesinstead. In the same blog post, they also recommended other gameswith queer representation. These are only some examples by TellMe Why, where their organizational practices match their strategiccommunication alignment with LGBTQ+ stakeholders.On the other hand, Bugsnax did not utilize Instagram as acommunication channel for LGBTQ+ alignment at all. Of thefour posts, none pertained to queer topics and were thereforeexcluded. Surprisingly, Twitter did not attempt to overtly align withLGBTQ+ stakeholders either. Since 12 June 2020, the account hasonly published 17 tweets that touch on LGBTQ+ topics. Of thosetweets, only one was posted during Pride Month, the others werepublished during off-months.This sole remaining PrideMonth tweet is a retweet that stronglycondemns the practice of rainbow capitalism (rainbow washing)and urges people to spend their money directly with queer artists.The remaining tweets highlight other queer individuals who wereinvolved in the production of Bugsnax or spread information aboutvarious queer games and developers.Young Horses generally refrained from overtly communicatingLGBTQ+ stakeholder alignment and focused on platforming orsupporting queer individuals in the video game industry instead.This communication strategy is in line with the opinions of bothKevin Zhun and Sage Coffey. They both stated that they aimed tonormalize queer representation and inclusion in the game withoutothering anyone (King, 2021; Troughton, 2021a). Hence, socialmedia communication focused more on the quirky half-bug, half-snack creatures, and fan creations rather than centering on theirqueer characters. Their communication strategy remained the samethroughout the year. PrideMonth and other LGBTQ+-centric daysdid not change how Bugsnax communicates about LGBTQ+ topics;they offer a platform to queer games and individuals all year longalongside their quirky creatures.Queer branding and communicationTell Me Why, in contrast to Bugsnax, is more directly brandedas a queer game, through its integration of trans narratives, andthis is reflected in their strategic communication efforts on socialmedia. Even though Bugsnax amassed more tweets in roughly thesame amount of time, only a marginal amount of them mentionedLGBTQ+ topics. The account only posted one tweet during PrideMonth whereas Tell Me Why accumulated 26 tweets and sixInstagram posts. While Bugsnax’s strategic communication conveysthe normalcy of queer identities, Tell Me Why conveys attempts tomake themmore visible. Consequently, this comparison shows thatFrontiers inCommunication 06 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710the gamewith themore obvious queer branding focused extensivelyon communicating alignment with their LGBTQ+ stakeholdersduring Pride Month. Communication efforts include awarenessand visibility days, with more than half of the Tell Me Why tweetsoccurring then. Bugsnax does post during these events but notwith the intention of using them to overtly further stakeholderalignment. Hence, Tell Me Why deliberately engages in strategiccommunication during Pride Month and visibility or awarenessdays, with the intention of strengthening LGBTQ+ stakeholderalignment. They usually do so by voicing support, care, andadvocacy for LGBTQ+ communities and their issues. In doing so,Tell Me Why positions itself as a socially responsible brand. Sincethey place great emphasis on trans visibility and awareness days,this consistent communication positions them as a trans-friendlybrand as well.On the other hand, Bugsnax seldomly engaged in suchactivities, with their sole Pride Month tweet condemning rainbowwashing instead. Most of Bugsnax’s tweets count as off-monthcommunication, they are utilized to showcase queer individualswho worked on the game or to make a larger audience aware ofother queer indie games and their creators. While not making overtalignment claims to stakeholders, this strategic communicationnormalizes queer identities and positions the company as a queer-supportive brand, accordingly aligning with LGBTQ+ stakeholderexpectations. Their strategic communication also appears authenticto their stakeholders due to the sparse but consistent off-month communication.Overall, both game companies engage in different methods ofstakeholder alignment; Tell Me Why communicates more oftenand adamantly advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, while Bugsnaxcommunicates sparingly, and therefore attempts to normalize theexistence of queer identities within its games and the industry.5.3. Authenticity comparedTo explore how authentic the communicated LGBTQ+stakeholder alignment is, the answers to RQ1 were contextualizedwith further organizational discourse, such as websites, blogposts, and interviews. The data was categorized along Limet al. (2022) authenticity dimensions (continuity, credibility,representativeness, integrity, and symbolism) with the objectivebeing to observe how organizational practices compare to thestrategic communication of CSR initiatives by video gamebrands. Using the POA framework (Lim et al., 2022) to lookat organizational practices allows us to assess the perceivedauthenticity of the brands for LGBTQ+ stakeholders. Itis important to highlight that the following analysis onlyallows us to note the perceived authenticity of the videogame brands and not whether they are authentic in theirorganizational practices.5.3.1. Tell me whyAnalyzing the perceived authenticity of Tell Me Why provedto be more complex due to the publisher and developer beingseparate organizations operating independently from one another.Additionally, Xbox Game Studio operates within the Microsoftcorporation, which complicates matters further. One of the firstperceived organizational authenticity dimensions to observe isintegrity. The Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s CorporateEquality Index provided great insight into Microsoft’s LGBTQ+company policies. For 17 years, Microsoft has received a scoreof 100, exemplifying its supportive policies (Capossela, 2022).Unfortunately, no such rating was available for DONTNOD,leaving only their website for further insight, where theyhighlight their inclusivity and diversity as key elements in theircorporate practice.For continuity, the Corporate Equality Index gave a greatindication of Microsoft’s continued commitment to its LGBTQ+employees. DONTNOD has a history of LGBTQ+ characterinclusion in their games, although some representation has beencriticized in the past, arguing that it used the “Bury Your Gays”trope (Chan, 2017; Troughton, 2021b). The continued support ofLGBTQ+ communities is also constantly voiced in the social mediacommunication of Tell Me Why. In our sample, they supportedtrans and queer communities, also urging their audience to dothe same.Credibility was observed in the cooperation of Nick Adams,August Black, and Blair Durkee during the production process.These valuable trans perspectives helped DONTNOD and XboxGame Studios in their endeavor to deliver an authentic characterand narrative, one which does not rely on harmful tropes andstereotypes. They did not shy away from including negativeexperiences that can occur for trans people but dealt withthem in an adequate way instead. Another demonstrationof commitment to queer representation was the choice toonly hire trans voice actors for the localized versions of thegame. Tyler’s depiction as a well-rounded character, who isnot only defined by his trans identity, offers stakeholders theability to connect with the character and provides a positivemedia representation, falling under the symbolism dimensionof authenticity.For representativeness, it should be emphasized that acontinuous effort is made by Tell Me Why to platform notonly queer individuals but also queer creators and their games.However, as of December 2022, one factor that negatively affectsthe perceived authenticity of Tell Me Why is that the gameis not available to purchase in 13 countries, among which areChina, Russia, and Turkey. Being unavailable in these countries,which have a more anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment, does not supportthe strategic communication made to align with LGBTQ+stakeholders. Instead, it highlights national cultural values andidentities, meaning that regional markets are prioritized overuniversal LGBTQ+ stakeholder support.5.3.2. BugsnaxSince Young Horses is a small independent developer andhas only published two games, their perceived authenticitycannot be analyzed conclusively due to the lack of onlinediscourse surrounding their organizational practices. Their website,in general, seems to imply an LGBTQ+ inclusive workingenvironment, and the job listings strongly encourage queer peopleFrontiers inCommunication 07 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710to apply. Of the nine employees, Kevin Zuhn is the only non-binary person. Other queer people could not be publicly identified.The wording of their job listing adds to the credibility of YoungHorses, with it being an equal-opportunity workplace with genuineLGBTQ+ affiliation. Furthermore, credibility is shown in theinterviews with Kevin Zuhn and Sage Coffey when both elaborateon how they combat harmful stereotypes in the writing processand try to deliver seamless queer inclusion. Employing CaseyMongillo as the voice for the non-binary character also supportsthe commitment of Bugsnax to queer representation. Not includingexplanation scenes in writing further accentuates the normalcyof queer identities in the Bugsnax universe. Coffey states thatthe absence of these scenes is because the game was not writtenpurely with a cisgender audience in mind. The representation ofa lesbian and gay couple, in addition to a non-binary character,stresses Bugsnax’s commitment to representing the diversity ofqueer individuals.6. DiscussionOur research examined the strategic communication of therespective developers/publishers of the video games Tell Me Whyand Bugsnax to assess their LGBTQ+ stakeholder alignment. Wecompared their strategic communication on social media and theircorporate social responsibility practices (LGBTQ+), to assess theiralignment and perceived authenticity from LGBTQ+ stakeholders.Comparing their strategic communication with organizationalpractices communicated in other online discourses, our findingsindicate that perceived authenticity is usually achieved not onlythrough fulfilling the criteria of the perceived organizationalauthenticity scale (Lim et al., 2022) but also when strategiccommunication with stakeholders is consistent with certainorganizational practices. Our findings noted that this strategiccommunication is influenced by the queer branding of the videogames, which we use in this research to mean how much LGBTQ+themes are directly involved in the game narrative.Bugsnax and Young Horses take a different approach in theircommunication with LGBTQ+ stakeholders. While Tell Me Whyuses every opportunity to showcase its alignment with its LGBTQ+audience, due to the direct involvement of trans characters in thegame narrative, Bugsnax does not. The goal of Bugsnax’s strategiccommunication is not to foster LGBTQ+ stakeholder alignmentwith their consumers. They utilize their platform to integrate queerrepresentation into the normalcy of everyday life, like how it is donewithin the game. Zuhn and Coffey both expressed that they want tocombat the otherness of queer inclusion that is often dominant inother media. Neither their Twitter nor Instagram accounts engagein extensive Pride Month communication, just like how queerrepresentation is never ‘othered’ within their games. However, theirsincere alignment with LGBTQ+ stakeholders is made clear inother organizational communication.For example, with Bugsnax, we noted no divergence betweencommunicated CSR and corporate practice, so essentially, theyappear to not engage in rainbow washing. The most notableaspect of their strategic communication is their refusal to treatqueer and cisgender identities differently. They avoid otheringqueer identities and deconstruct the “us vs. them” narrative, bothwithin their games and through their strategic communicationpatterns. Bugsnax does this by keeping overt LGBTQ+ stakeholdersupport to a minimum and instead using their account to givea platform to queer video games and their queer creators, notonly during Pride Month but throughout the year. Overall,their organizational communication is in line with organizationalpractices found in other online discourses, indicating that YoungHorses and Bugsnax are perceived to be authentically aligned withLGBTQ+ stakeholders.On the other hand, DONTNOD uses Tell Me Why’s socialmedia as a platform to overtly align with LGBTQ+ stakeholders.This is due to the game’s branding, or how heavily LGBTQ+ themesare involved in the narrative. Dealing strongly with trans issues,the game is utilized as a vehicle to raise awareness and advocatefor LGBTQ+ rights during Pride Month. As pointed out, sincequeer issues are within and central to their game, DONTNOD’sstrategic communication incorporates them as well. Still, theperceived authenticity of Tell Me Why in part resembles Venter’s(2021) findings concerningOverwatch and Blizzard Entertainment,meaning that Xbox Game Studios (the publisher) support itsLGBTQ+ stakeholders, but only to a certain extent.With Tell Me Why being unavailable to purchase in severalcountries with anti-LGBTQ+ policies, this demonstrates how thepublisher prioritizes potential market share over real CSR. Bugsnax,on the other hand, is available in every country, which againechoes their sentiment of not wanting to other queer identities.Inconsistent CSR and rainbow washing might be easier to avoidwhen operating as a smaller organization; nevertheless, it is stillpossible when most of the dimensions of authenticity (Lim et al.,2022) are met. Still, our research indicates that walking the walkcan be done when queer inclusion is the core of the strategiccommunication effort.7. Limitations and future workThe limitations of this research include not consideringstrategic communication outside of social media by bothcompanies, as well as not deconstructing the queer identitieswithin the games themselves, which would have greatlybenefited the discourse analysis. Deconstructing the identitieswithin the games while beneficial does not strictly fit underthe umbrella of strategic communication, and hence wasnot included. However, it is still communication targetingstakeholders and can be considered important. Also, onlythe main account for the video games was analyzed. Thiswas done to ensure that communication originated fromsources (and content) of interest and to reduce the amountof filtering involved. Future research can incorporateadditional associated accounts (publishers, developers, etc.)to contextualize the strategic communication efforts moreadequately while incorporating more filtering to pinpointrelevant content.Moreover, we understand that our work is only concerningtwo specific cases and that findings may differ for othervideo game developers and publishers. However, by creatinga case definition based on queer branding, we selectedtypical, frequent, and theoretically relevant cases for ourFrontiers inCommunication 08 frontiersin.orgGaudszun and Elmezeny 10.3389/fcomm.2023.1167710research (Mayring, 2007). The next step to validate ourfindings and draw broader conclusions would be to broadenthe range of cases. Case study researchers recommendworking with three to ten single cases (Yin, 2005), whichwe can select with various ranges of queer representationand narratives.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will bemade available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementEthical approval was not required for the studyinvolving human data in accordance with the locallegislation and institutional requirements.

    "abstract": "Queer identities have predominantly existed at the peripheries of media representation as well as communication research. Linking this research gap with the field of video games as a medium, this study examines video game companies and their strategic communication efforts toward LGBTQ+ stakeholders through critical discourse analysis with influences of queer theory. With this focus, we aim to identify how video game companies discursively construct queer identities and utilize them for strategic communication. Through the analysis of the social media and online discourses surrounding two games with queer inclusion, we show that queer branding has an influence on the way strategic communication efforts are employed throughout the year, as well as the type of content. Furthermore, we show that in our selected cases, organizations can successfully align themselves with their LGBTQ+ stakeholders by having queer inclusion at the core of their strategic communication efforts and authentic organizational practices",
