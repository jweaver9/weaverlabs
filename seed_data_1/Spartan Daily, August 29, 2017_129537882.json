Students demanded Aptekar be taken off SJSU’s payroll and aimed to raise awareness about sexual harassment on campus.“When I heard about the whole Dr. Aptekar situation coming back to San Jose State and teaching those classes, I just kind of realized that something had to be done,” said counseling education graduate student Valerie Lamb.Lamb acted as one of the coordinators of Monday’s sit-in. She said that one of the goals of the demonstration was to give a platform for students to voice their concerns to the department. “I’m really disturbed by the way the institution handled the whole thing,” said education counseling professor Jason Laker. “Aptekar being in a classroom or not is one of the consequences of them SIT-IN | Page 2 People unite to celebrate LGBTQ acceptance in San JoseNOE MAGANA | SPARTAN DAILYPresident Mary Papazian gives her 2017 Fall Welcome Address on Aug. 24 where she shared her vision for SJSU in the future with members of the campus community.SPEECH | Page 2 San Jose State University President Mary Papazian presented her plans for the university and welcomed new faculty in her 2017 Fall Welcome Address at the Diaz Compean Student Union Ballroom on Thursday. “We are reliant on outdated, ineffi cient [and] cumbersome procedures and protocols,” Papazian said in her address. To better serve nearly 35,000 students, she added that the entire community must be open to change and innovation. In order to help stimulate innovation, Papazian said the school should look into increasing liberal arts in the student curriculum. She mentioned a fi rst-year student experience “steeped” in the liberal arts, a senior year project that demonstrates critical thinking, communication skills and “other forms of creative expression,” as well as adding coding to all offered majors. “I could easily connect to what she was saying,” engineering management graduate student Sudarshan Grama Jayaram said. “Just knowing technology doesn’t really help you, but you should also know the human factor...to tackle the world.”Papazian pointed out that liberal arts is already scattered throughout SJSU’s curriculum.  Examples include the intersections of engineering and marketing, physics and animation, packaging technology and supply chain management and nursing with simulations of lifelike, hands-on patient interactions. Wayne Wright, head coach of the gymnastics team, called Papazian’s speech inspiring. He thought the most important issue was about being innovative and taking advantage of the community’s diversity. Papazian also addressed graduation rates, housing and food insecurity. Developing public and private partnerships in order to create affordable housing for students in stressful situations was mentioned.Parking is another issue the school will look into. Papazian said she wants the school to provide its community a way of knowing which parking spaces are available rather than building parking lots. The president said the school and students should have a “growth mindset” by embracing challenges and questioning the status quo. “Students can PRIDEPARADE | Page 2Silicon Valley Pride held its festival and parade this past weekend in San Jose.Festivities began Saturday night where several booths regarding safe sex, religion and employee recruitment advocated for the LGBTQ community. The following day, a parade began at Plaza de Cesar Chavez and ended on the intersection of St. John Street and Market Street. San Jose sports teams also attended the pride festival to show their support for the LGBTQ community. Along with sports teams, the West Valley Medical Center provided attendees with contraceptives. Groups also handed out brochures and pamphlets regarding safe sex. According to the city’s website, San Jose held its very fi rst gay rights rally 42 years ago when local California lawmakers banned same-sex dancing in public. The festival was fi lled with many different colored fl ags that surrounded the entire park. People that attended were advocating for acceptance, love and equal rights.Toward the back of the park, a DJ entertained the crowd by playing electronic house music. Attendees danced in front of the stage during the night. San Jose residents Murray Wicks and Xander Abbe enjoyed the music and ambiance of the pride festival. “It’s nice to be able to just enjoy the festival without having to work it,” Wicks said. In the past Wicks helped organize the Pride parade in San Jose. His partner Abbe says he has enjoyed seeing what his partner has created over the years as an organizer. Religious fi gures from the community also attended the event. Pastor Bryan James Franzen from the Presbyterian church was there as an ally.“Our tradition affi rms gay marriage… everybody is a gift from God,” Franzen said. Franzen reaffi rmed that relationships do not have to be heterosexual in order for it to be special or approved by God. “God created some people to be straight, some people to BY DIANA AVILAStaff  Writer“Our tradition affi rms gay marriage... everybody is a gift from God.”James FranzenPresbyterian church PastorSARAH KLIEVES | SPARTAN DAILYDespite both of his classes being cancelled this semester, students protest professor Lewis Aptekar’s continued employment by the university in the Sweeney Hall courtyard Monday.

During this 2015 investigation, other allegations surfaced dating back to 2014.In response, SJSU initially placed Aptekar on paid administrative leave in 2015 during the investigation.“Coming in I was told ‘Watch out for this professor. He could be inappropriate,’” education counseling alumna Viviana Arriola said. “It’s very disheartening. I fi nd it an insult that not only is he employed but that he still has voting rights within this department.” Aptekar’s administrative leave was lifted and he was brought back to teach two classes this semester: one on trauma counseling and a graduate research course. The trauma class was cancelled and the research class is now being taught by professor Dolores Mena, according to Media Relations Director Pat Harris. Students feared that they would not be graduating on time because of the class’s cancellation. During the sit-in demonstration, they expressed their discontent with paying for classes that were no longer offered to them.  “The sanctions that were placed on this professor were like a slap to the wrist,” Lamb said. “Students need to speak up because the university will [respond] to students that speak up.”  His current employment caused students to come together and speak out against the university decision to keep him as a faculty member. “As a brother, I just feel that it would be very disheartening to have my sister enter a classroom where a man or a professor — who is 40 years older than her — telling her all this creepy stuff,” said Mexican-American studies graduate student Eduardo Castaneda. “It was important for me to be in solidarity with my co-workers.” DIANA AVILA | SPARTAN DAILYWomen at a booth hand out information and necklaces at Silicon Valley Pride.

The LGBTQ community has been targeted in previous months by President Donald Trump’s ban on openly transgender military service members. During his presidential campaign, Trump said that he would protect the rights of the LGBTQ community. Progress had been previously made when former President Barack Obama repealed the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell Policy. Before being repealed, the policy did not allow openly gay service member to serve in the military. Attendee Todd Kraus mentioned that he would love for it to be Pride everyday, not just once a year. The next Silicon Valley Pride weekend is set for summer 2018.successfully take 15 semester units and we should be aggressively exploring student housing options, on campus and off,” Papazian said. “It’s easily doable,” hospitality freshman Hayden Houser said. This academic year, President Papazian announced that SJSU welcomed more than 9,000 first year and transfer students, the largest number of new students ever. President Papazian also highlighted that there are about 15,000 students living within three miles of campus, which is a sign that SJSU is no longer a “commuter school,” but a “destination” school.Additionally, the school expects to add 55 tenure and tenure-track faculty positions this year to the 63 new faculty joining SJSU this fall. SJSU has recruited 187 faculty since 2014, according to President Papazian.President Papazian also welcomed Marie Tuite as the new Director of Intercollegiate Athletics and thanked Dr. Reggie Blaylock for his commitment to students as the Vice President for Student Affairs since 2015. Blaylock will leave SJSU this fall.Toward the end, Papazian outlined the process for the administration’s strategic planning plan.There will be a public strategic planning kickoff on Sept. 14 followed by workshops that will provide input for a study. The school plans to have a draft of the plan published next spring for community input.The process will be guided by a committee, aided by a facilitator and co-chaired by Provost Andy Feinstein and Senate Chair Stefan Frazier.With transparency and inclusivity in mind, Papazian said a website has been created where progress and updates can be monitored.

Many people struggle trying to relax and appreciate themselves or their hard work. Students can enjoy guided stretches, meditation, mindful conversation and other exercises through the end of September, thanks to Rashmi Guttal at the weekly Zen Den at St. James Park.These events are collaborations of Be The Change Yoga and Wellness Studio and San Jose Parks and Recreation. “We want to bring more activity and some music and so we brought in the Zen Den through the partnership with them to bring in this mindfulness meditative space,” said Conscious San Jose Parks program manager and yoga instructor Rashmi Guttal.The Zen Den is a large pop-up sanctuary that Guttal sets up every Friday from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in St. James Park. Within the den, guests can relax, meditate and use different art modalities and verbal sharing to facilitate lessons in self-confidence and appreciation. This free activity provides an opportunity for people to get in touch with their inner selves and simply just enjoy tranquility.“This is my first time coming to the Zen Den but I’ve been to similar gatherings,” said studio art junior Samantha Piña. “I was glad I was able to visit it and they said that they will be going on through September. I plan on coming to the next one with the music because that sounds really nice.”A number of art modalities were used during this particular event. Participants wrote down stressful or negative parts of their life and shredded them. They also sculpted and shared their inner critic, followed by an introduction of its counterpart: the wise mind.Guttal believes that the program brings conscious activities such as meditation and yoga to help put a restless mind at ease. Anyone can access it and these practices can be used in everyday life to take back control of one’s life.For Guttal, one of the greatest parts of the Zen Den is that although no one knows each other beforehand, they all still share some beautiful details about themselves. “I’ve never heard of it, but it sounds really cool,” said business freshman Maria Garcia. “I bet it would help me de-stress a lot.”Be The Change is a donation-based studio located on First Street. The studio is only a ten-minute walk from campus and it gives out resources to the San Jose community.“There are so many opportunities these days with Youtube, Yoga Journal and other great sources,” Guttal said. “We have so many opportunities to access meditation and I would definitely recommend looking up some resources and checking out our studio at Be The Change Yoga and Wellness.”While Guttal and Be The Change strive to bring yoga and meditation to the community through the studio and events at St. James Park, they are also expanding to other parks in San Jose. The staff at Be The Change are heavily involved with the Conscious San Jose Festival taking place Sept. 23. “If anyone is interested and wants a taste of yoga and meditation, we would love to see you there,” Guttal said.Families gathered to watch and cheer duos competitively stomp grapes in wooden buckets at San Jose’s History Park for the 37th annual Italian Family Festa Saturday and Sunday.Last weekend marked the second year the Italian-American Heritage Foundation held the festival at History Park.Although the Italian Family Festa celebrates Italian culture, families from all walks of life attended the free festival. For the organ izat ion’s president David P e r z i n s k i , this kind of turnout wasn’t a surprise. “[It’s] not any different this year than it’s ever been,” Perzinski said. “[It’s] family-oriented and everyone has family and everyone brings their family.”The Italian-American Heritage Foundation has been a staple in the San Jose community since 1976. For at least 40 years, the goal of the organization has been to preserve Italian culture and heritage and share it with others.Visitors endured the overwhelming summer heat to experience live music, food and wine, free activities and an opportunity to connect with others in the community. “I love being outside,” San Jose resident Ann Webb said. “I love going to the free festivals where there’s music and food and people.” Nearly every acre of the park was bustling with activity. Booths lined the streets. Some offered classic Italian dishes and wine while other booths displayed arts and crafts for sale.Perched on top of a tall gazebo were opera singers, whose elegant voices carried through the space. Local bands and singers performed live on another stage. Performers Tom Torriglia & Bella Ciao sang classic Italian songs and eccentric songs of classic Italian dishes.Attendees also participated in wholesome activities such as competitive grape stomping and lace making. Local artists showcased their work and held a panel to discuss their work with onlookers. Other panels present at the festival discussed the history of Italians in World War II internment camps and offered a glimpse into Italian genealogy. “We try to connect people and people find relatives and people that they know,” Perzinski said. “It’s really important in these days to connect in a community way.”San Jose resident Brandon Sitte has been coming to these kinds of festivals for 20 years with his wife and now with his son. He believes it is important for his son to experience the culture at an early age. “My wife’s first solid food was at an Italian festival,” Sitte said. “She’s been coming here for 30-plus years now so it’s a family tradition in a way.”Proceeds from the festival help fund the over 500 member organization and its scholarship program. According to Perzinski, the organization gave $35,000 in scholarships this year to 14 students. Perzinski also proudly stated that the Italian Family Festa will return next year.BY JONAS ELAMStaff  WriterFollow Jonas on Twitter@TheElamite(Left) Participants share their self-designed “inner critics.” (Above) Attendes display their “inner critics” which are built from play dough.

He knew he was going to face backlash, and he knew he would have to answer to the media, the fans and his teammates.  He also knew this could jeopardize his NFL career. As of now, no team has offered him a job. “It's a lot more than just he's not on the team because he doesn't want to stand for the national anthem,\" Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy said in an ESPN article. \"That may have something to do with it, but I think also it has a lot to do with his play.”McCoy is right. Kaepernick does not possess an accurate arm that would make him an elite quarterback. This gives Kaepernick’s protest more credibility because he doesn’t have a high status in the NFL which would make him practically untouchable. By switching from sitting to kneeling, he demonstrated that he understood he made a mistake by remaining seated because it could be interpreted as being disrespectful to the fl ag and anthem. Kaepernick respected the criticism which led to a more respectful way of protesting. The big debate is whether it was okay for him to use his platform as a professional athlete and whether he was disrespecting “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Do not misinterpret his protest as a protest against our country. He is protesting the systems that allow minorities to be oppressed and law enforcement to abuse its authority.One of the cases that got national attention was a video that emerged in January where a Baltimore offi cer pretended to fi nd a bag of what looked like drugs after he planted the bag, turned on his body camera and walked back to the spot of the bag.In an interview for the website the Post Game, former football player Jim Brown said he disagrees with Kaepernick’s method, but not his issues.\"I'm an American,\" Brown said. \"I don't desecrate my fl ag and my national anthem. I'm not gonna do anything against the fl ag and national anthem.”Yet, Kaepernick never burned the fl ag or booed the national anthem. He only sat and kneeled. That’s it.It’s not the fi rst time athletes used their platforms to protest social issues.\"Protest is a good thing because you're trying to expose certain things through protest,\" said John Carlos in an ESPN article. San Jose State honors alumni Carlos and Tommie Smith for their protest during the national anthem in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics with a statue of their gloved fi sts in the air. Like Kaepernick, they faced criticism for their actions but eventually got recognition for their protest.Kaepernick is going beyond the sporting community to get his message across.He has pledged one million dollars to different charities that deal with social issues.  He funds Know Your Rights Camp, which according to its website, “is a free campaign for youth to raise awareness on higher education, self empowerment, and instruction to properly interact with law enforcement in various scenarios.”The national anthem is a source of pride and honor. It gives us a sense of patriotism when we hear it, so it’s easy to view people as unpatriotic when they disrespect it. “When there’s signifi cant change and I feel like that fl ag represents what it’s supposed to represent, this country is representing people the way that it’s supposed to, I’ll stand,” Kaepernick said when he fi rst addressed his protest with the media.Kaepernick is not disrespecting the national anthem. On the contrary, he is demonstrating what it truly means to be free, to be brave and to be an American.Noe MaganaStaff  WriterFollow Noe on Twitter@NoeMaganaRStanding with Kaepernick is dividing Americans C olin Kaepernick’s kneeling during the national anthem has been a popular controversy recently. People can criticize him for kneeling, but there is one thing they cannot change: he has every right to do so.Having the right to do something and doing something right are different.“Colin Kaepernick is practicing his right to freedom of speech by kneeling during games, but he’s dividing people, not uniting them. This is, like, a time to think about working together,” said biology freshman Isaac Lopez.Kaepernick picked the wrong opponent. He has stated that this is a problem with our country, but the issues he describes are not the government oppressing the people. It is people oppressing people.“He shouldn’t be mad at the country, he should be mad at individuals,” said Lopez.Racism is done by an individual. Systematic oppression is specifi cally enforced by a government. Apartheid, the Holocaust and Jim Crow laws are examples, and nothing similar is in effect today. Effects from institutions of systematic oppression may have racially infl uenced some people, but the country itself is not racist. The U.S. is now set up to prevent racism with laws such as affi rmative action and the Fourteenth Amendment.Kneeling in protest of the country causes disunity. He should be fi ghting racism itself. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a fl ag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” said Kaepernick in an interview with NFL media. The United States does not oppress people of color. Individuals within it do. “To a lot of people, standing for the anthem is for the military and stuff, not just the U.S. as a whole,” said computer science sophomore Matt Adams. He is not against the military, but is still disrespecting it. In a time where being offensive is so impactful, it seems he is disregarding one side.While Kaepernick has stated that he is protesting the country as a whole, he claimed that he has “great respect for men and women that have fought for this country… they fi ght for liberty and justice for everyone. And that’s not happening,” said Kaepernick in a post-game interview with ESPN. There are many issues that are bigger priorities than blaming a country for the actions of some of its citizens. Voters in 2016 considered things like the economy, terrorism, foreign policy, healthcare, immigration and social security bigger issues than the treatment of racial minorities, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.This is not to say that racial issues were not important, as 63 percent of pollees considered it a major issue, but it was ranked ninth.“Maybe he could use his fame on something bigger,” Adams said. “He could change a lot.”Kaepernick should be focusing on more pressing issues, but if he wants to fi ght racism, he should fi ght racism, not his country. He should improve his methods. While his kneeling is causing controversy, he is still doing some things right. He pledged to donate a million dollars to different organizations and is making good on his word.Kaepernick wants to do the right thing but he is going about it the wrong way. I hope someone as infl uential as him helps make this country a unifi ed place, not a divided one. So stand for your country, not with the man kneeling because he is as confused as his hashtag. #IStand/Sit/KneelWithKap?Jonas ElamStaff  WriterFollow Jonas on Twitter@TheElamiteTh e dawn of gentrifi cationin San Jose is approachingWhile Google is hurdling over to San Jose like a dark cloud full of techies and engineering jargon, people from our city are getting ready for the dawn of searching for homes online and packing boxes. According to KPIX, Google has bought land to build a 6,000,000 square foot offi ce and retail building. Whether some may not agree to its arrival, it is already coming. Let’s keep Google as our search engines and far away from San Jose. As we’ve seen in many cities nationwide such as San Francisco, once a wealthy company moves in and starts to buy land, rent and mortgage prices soar exceedingly. We need to point out that rent surely will raise and more affordable homes will need to be allocated to blue collared workers and those living from paycheck to paycheck. According to Axiometrics, the average rent for apartments in Santa Clara County is about $2,857 a month. Bringing in yet another tech giant into our city would be the cherry on the top of this horrifi c gentrifi cation experience.At this point, we as students and San Jose residents need to hold Google accountable to the drastic changes it will bring. Numerous students at SJSU already struggle to fi nd reasonable priced homes. Having Google affect our living expenses would plummet the fi nancial opportunities of students already struggling to fi nd a secure home, and burden those who live in one. Tuition has risen fi ve percent and students have to pay around $254 per unit, according the San Jose State website. Here at our university, Academic Advising and Retention Services advises to take 15 units a semester to graduate on time. Knowing that, students have to pay around $3,810 per semester. Google might mean well, but why bring a company to fl uctuate the economy in a city that is already burdened? Instead, companies should invest their new sites in cities that actually need an economic boost. Pressure is felt when tech companies such as Google move into our cities because our family members and peers advise us to study to be tech workers. The reality is that many of us don’t want to be tech workers. Not everyone works or thinks the same.Ultimately, the reality is that Google is certainly moving into San Jose.  Since Google is moving into our city as a neighbor, it should help our communities and education system.Google has a huge responsibility coming into our city. Some of us didn’t choose to have the company come into San Jose, but now we have to adjust to the sudden change. Google is like that one family member during Thanksgiving who randomly shows up only during the holidays and starts moving around your center pieces, messing with the food you’ve prepared and puts on music that only they like. We have to welcome them, but also put our foot down and make our concerns known. Google’s behemoth entity is coming to San Jose like a huge tidal wave. Now it’s our responsibility to prepare and educate ourselves to the changes coming along.

It takes anti-American motivations to do it under a tainted defi nition of free speech. It takes a pair of balls to plan it in the heart of the Bay Area.All of that is atrophied if you cancel the previous evening.While fresh wounds still sting since the recent tragedies in Charlottesville, over the weekend a supposed pro-Trump group identifying itself as Patriot Prayer organized a similar event in San Francisco’s Crissy Field, only to back out at the last minute.I guess all of the far-right reckless abandon ran out in the face of all of those scary liberals.If nothing, it proved that no matter how hard the Bay Area may try to distance itself from Trump’s America, it can’t stop Trump’s America from both coming here and viewing this place as a liberal scorn on the country. This place has a target on its back and is the epicenter of the Trump backlash. It’s a place for people like Breitbart editors Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos to come and disturb as much of the peace as they can, then run back to Fox News and cry “I told you so.”The Bay Area, however, is more than a place to prove a point or back some crass political agenda. People live peacefully here. We resist extremism here. Dreamers come and create their own stories here.That’s why the violence that erupted this weekend was the wrong way to handle the rise of hate. We’re better than this. The more violence that breaks out here will not only weaken our communities, but will continue to fuel the already toxic view Trump country has of the Bay. In the past peaceful protest was and will remain the most effective form of resistance we can practice.  If you’re wondering where the commander-in-chief’s thoughts are in all of this, don’t bother. He’s busy either blocking people on Twitter or off campaigning for an election that’s been over for nine months in some crumbling event center, throwing more red meat at his snarling followers.To these many out-of-towners who view the bay as more of an ideological battleground than a community, take heed of Boston and the hundreds who gathered this weekend at Crissy Field, Alamo Park and around the city. You are peacefully outnumbered. Despite what right wing propaganda states, the Bay Area will always welcome those who come here looking to live life to its potential. But, like any other city in this country, I ask that you come here with dignity and respect for our cities’ traditions and each other.

We resist extremism here. Dreamers come and create their own stories here. That’s why the violence that erupted this weekend was the wrong way to handle the rise of hate.”SPORTS6Outside hitter Giulia Gávio was awarded Mountain West Volleyball Offensive Player of the Week after leading San Jose State to victories over Pepperdine University and the University of San Francisco to open the season.She contributed 38 kills, 27 digs and 39.5 points with 30 of those points coming from the Spartans’ fi rst game against Pepperdine Friday night.“When you see every teammate giving everything they have, it’s impossible for you not to give everything you have,” Gávio said.An estimated 150 spectators packed “The Pit” in Yoshihiro Uchida Hall to witness SJSU face off with Pepperdine — a team which shared a similar record last year.The match stretched to fi ve sets ending with the Spartans taking the fi nal set into extras, 18-16.“Pepperdine has some talented athletes over there and they’re well coached,” Shepardson said. “We have a big conference and we want to be pushed.”The Spartans managed to fl ip the momentum for the next two games—winning 25-20 in set two and 25-23 in set three. However, both head coach Jolene Shepardson and associate head coach Aaron Shepardson received yellow cards for disputing calls with the referees.“We are very passionate — we care a great deal about our players and our team and our program,” Jolene Shepardson said. “So I’m going to fi ght for them when I feel it’s appropriate.”The fi nal play of the match  concluded with Pepperdine attempting to convince the fi rst referee to overturn a decision that was in favor of SJSU.“I just felt confi dent, like I knew we were going to get the win,” libero Luiza Andrade said. “We were playing hard and we knew what each other was doing on the court, so I was just confi dent the entire game.”SJSU carried its momentum strong as it traveled north the next day to face off against USF. Although the Spartans stumbled in the fi rst set against the Dons, SJSU won the next three sets and became the only undefeated team in the Mountain West Conference so far this year.Outside hitter Fernanda Vido shined offensively in the match against the Dons, getting 24 kills. Defensively, Andrade made the biggest impact with 17 kills.“We’re getting a bit more mature because we have been a young team for a couple years,” Jolene Shepardson said. “I’m glad the girls rose to the challenge and really fought tonight and stayed together as a team through pressure.”SJSU travels to Southern California this weekend to face UC Riverside Friday, then Cal State Fullerton and Howard University  Saturday.Tuesday, August 29, 2017SJSU breaks the heart of Pepperdine in season openerWOMEN’S VOLLEYBALLWILLIAM YAP | SPARTAN DAILY(TOP) Luiza Andrade and Jamie Hirai (11) embrace each other as their team celebrates another point awarded to SJSU.
