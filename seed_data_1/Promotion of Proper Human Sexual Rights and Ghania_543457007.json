Inattendance at the event were some delegates from the European Union,the Australian High Commissioner to Ghana and the DanishAmbassador to Ghana. Subsequently, the European Union, on its officialFacebook, handled its advertised participation in the event and reiteratedits support for all civil society organisations supporting LGBTQI+ groups.The news was greeted with a plethora of critici .section of Ghanaians, with severalFE including NaorHouseof Chiefs, the National Chief Imam, the Christian Council, the CatholicBishops’ Conference and the National Coalition for Proper Hum:Sexual Rights and Family Values calling for the resource center t0.b6 shodown and persons involved in the opening of the centre, amestod andprosecuted.

Speaker of Parliament when the AustralianHighCommissioner paid a courtesy call on the Speaker on 1st April 2021, theStatement of the National House of Chiefs and the subsequentclosingdown of the resource centre are testaments of the Unacceptability ofLGBTTQQIAAP+ groups and their activities by the majority ofGhanaians.It is equally worth mentioning the emphatic positions of. our formerPresidents. In the case of the former President John Agyekum Kuffour,he recounted to the Accra FM radio station on 3% March, 2021 how hestood his ground and rejected the legalisation of8ay rights when he wasPresident. The former President specifically stated“I rejected LGBT legalisation when I was President because irbaffled me. It stiff baffles me because LGBTpractice is against ourculture, religion and even defies nature. No law allows suck g thing inGhana,”,»Additionally, the late President JE.A. Mills is credited to haveassertively communicated the position of Ghanaians on the issue of “iLGBTTQQIAAP+ when on 2m November, 2011, the BritishPrimeMinister, Dayiq Cameron, during an interactive session with the mediaat Osu Castle, intimated the policy of Britain to review its aid to countriesthatpersecute homosexuals or fail to respect gay rights. The latePresidentJE.A. Mills intimated thatii~/ PROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL, 2021“Let me make one thing very clear: no one can deny PrimeMinister Cameron his right to make policies, take initiatives or makestatements that reflect his societal norms and ideals but he does not3%. have the right to direct other sovereign nations as to what they shoulddo especially where their societal norms and ideals are differentfromthose which exist in Prime Minister Cameron's society. I, as President= ofthis nation will never initiate or support any attempts to legalizehomosexuality in Ghana. As a government, we will abide by theprinciples enshrinedin our Constitution which Constitution is supreme.Let me also say that, while we acknowledge all thefinancial assistanceandallthe aid which has beengiven to us by our developmentpartners,we will not accept any aid with strings attachedif that will not inureto our interests or the implementation or the utilisation of that aidwith strings attached would rather worsen our plight as a nation ordestroy the very society we want to use the money to improve.”.Civil Society Organisations, including the National Coalition forProper Human Sexual Rights and Family Values which is anamalgamation of Christian and para-Christian bodies, religious bodiesincluding the Ghana Pentecostal and Charismatic Council, the Coalitionof Muslim Organisations, Ghana, the National Chief Tmam’sOffice,the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, the Advocates for Christ, non-religiousbodies, the National House of Chiefs and opinion leaders in Ghana, havecondemned the advocacy activities of persons in support ofLGBTTQQIAAP+ and have further called on Government to strengthenthe laws of the country and resist attempts by any entity, whether local or: foreign, to misinterpret or worse of all, rewrite our laws to disregard the= cherished culture and social values of Ghanaians. The sovereignty ofthis country must be respected and protected. Among the multi-religiousvies faiths and various traditional and customary values across the country,an overwhelming consensus is established on the position of the nationin utter rejection of the practices of and advocacy for theLGBTTQQIAAP+ group in conformity with the customary law andtenets of faith and respect for public morality.iiivvRIGHTS ANDPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN TOESBILL 2021GHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL,: PP+ advocacySubsequent to the opening of the3 to the Rt.resource centre on 31% January 2021,wesubmit is admission of theHon.

We equally expressed conc ot Tor OUTeffects of such activities on Ghanaian culture and family val CoinStatement, we indicated our intention to propose a bipartisan forMember's Bill to proscribe the practices of and advocacyLGBTTQQIAAP+ in line with our customs and values as a people.In fulfilment of our intention, several stakeholder engagements wereheld to propose a Bill for introduction in Parliament. The contributionsof the National Coalition for Proper Human Sexual and Family Valuesand many other Civil Society Organisations have culminated in thepreparation of the Bill.LGBTTQQIAAP+ activities threaten the concept offamily and theassociated value systems that are central to the social structure ofall ethnicgroups in Ghana. The concept of family for Ghanaians has always beena unit of society initiated by marriage between a man and a ‘woman,each ofwhose gender is assigned at birth. Globalisation and itsattendantacculturation are supposed to augment the strength and values of statesand not to compromise the cultural and moral values therein. Therightof states to self-determination is a peremptory rule of internationalcustomary law that recognises the sovereignty of states and their powerto make laws to protect their values and identity, provided that the lawsdo not infringe on fundamental human rights. Indeed Article 2(4) of theUN Charter recognises the principle of sovereignty and equality of its .member states. In that regard, all member states are required to refrain intheir international relations from the threat or use of force against theterritorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any othermanner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations. In avastlyglobalised world where the threat of the infiltration of foreign cultures isever-present, states rely on the right to self-determination to preserve theirsocio-cultural values by enacting legislation to minimise the effect ofunacceptable foreign influence,iv/ PROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021‘The Bill gives consideration to the issueof whether of not prohibitingLGBTTQQIAAP+ persons from forming associations, groups andorganising people in any form for the purpose of advocating for and. promoting the rights of LGBTTQQIAAP+ persons constitutes aninfringement of the fundamental human right of freedom of speech andexpression or assembly or whether it constitutes discriminatory treatment,- which are guaranteed in Chapter Five of the 1992 Constitution,particularly in articles 12(2), 17(1) and 21(1)(a) and (d). It must be notedthat such rights or freedoms by their very nature are not absolute. The1992 Constitution prescribes reasonable restrictions that are necessaryfor public health, order or safety.As a first step, one must separate the prohibited acts from the rightto engage in their advocacy. One would invariably conclude that once theacts are prohibited under the Bill as being injurious to public health andsafety, any association, group, meetings or organisation of persons forthe purpose of promoting the prohibited acts would also be unlawful.It is this reasoning that provides justification for Parliament to enactlegislation such as the Vigilantism and Related Offences Act, 2019 (Act999) which proscribed the formation of groups for the furtherance of theinterests of group members by use of threat of violence or intimidation.Once it is determined that the object or purpose of the group isunlawful, there can be no right of assembly or association in respect ofthe object or purpose. Similarly, the Cybersecurity Act, 2020 (Act 1038),which was passed recently by Parliament permits reasonable restrictionsor interference in the enjoyment of the right to privacy of home, property,> correspondence or communication. Such interference is justified asreasonably necessary for public safety or the economic well-being of the: country, for the protection of health or morals and the prevention ofvy disorder or crime or for the protection ofthe rights offreedoms of others.State regulation of sexual behaviour is founded on the principle thatcertain sexual expressions such as sexual intercourse with a close relative,with or without the consent of the other party, are inimical to publichealth or public morality. In that vein, the Criminal Offences Act, 1960vy hadPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021a(Act 29), being the principal legislation on criminal offences in Ghana,prohibits incest and bestiality. Act 29 however, does not make specificreference to LGBTTQQIAAP+. This is no surprise since Act 29 waspromulgated about sixty years ago when the subject ofLGBTTQQIAAP+ otin Ghana was far-fetched. Section 104 of Act 29, which is the mostproximate reference to LGBTTQQIAAP+ only prohibits “unnaturalcarnal knowledge” as follows: -“(1) A person who has unnatural carnal knowledge(a) ofanotherperson ofnot less than sixteen yearsof age without theconsentofthat otherperson commits a first degreefelony and isliable on conviction to a term ofimprisonmentof not less thanfiveyears and not more than twenty-fiveyears; or(6) ‘of another personof not less than sixteen yearsof age with theconsent ofthat otherperson commits a misdemeanor; or(©) ofan animal commits a misdemeanor.(2) Unnatural camal knowledge is sexual intercourse with a person in anunnatural manner or; with an animal.”The Supreme Court, in Banosin v The Republic; No. J 3/2/2014 dated8* March 2014, S.C (Unreported), has clarified what may amount to “carnalknowledge” in its determination that“it is thefemale sex organs called the vulva and the vagina that arenormallypenetrated into during sexual act which can qualify to becarnal knowledge under sections 98 and 99 of Act 29.”.It is our ardent belief that the passage of the Bill to deal withLGBTTQQIAAP+ is apt considering the 2017 report of the ScienceResearch Council, communicated at the 4* National HIV and AIDSResearch Conference in Accra, which indicated that about 18.1% ofpeople living with AIDS are gays (men sleeping with men).Additionally, there is no specific legislation that imposes obligationson persons to promote sociocultural values in accordance with article 39of the 1992 Constitution. Clauses (1) and (2) of article 39 provide as - -follows:“(1) Subject to clause (2)ofthis article, the State shall take steps to encouragethe integration ofappropriate customary values into thefabric of national lifethrough formal and informal education and the conscious introduction ofcultural dimensions to relevant aspects ofnational planning.viPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021(2) The State shall ensure that appropriate customary and cultural valuesare adapted and developed as an integralpartofthegrowing needsof the society asa whole; and in particular that traditional practices which are injurious to the£a health and well-being of the person are abolished.”.‘We believe the time is ripe for Parliament to actualise the intentions¥ of the framers of our Constitution by providing a legal framework forthe promotion of the values that define our nationhood.One of the issues gaining currency is the increasing acceptance ofsame-sex marriages in some jurisdictions. The law applicable to marriagesin Ghana, being the Marriages Act, 1885-1985 (CAP 127) is silent on therequired sex of marriage partners. The general language ofthe provisions‘however, lends itself to the interpretationthatmarriage can only be betweena man and a woman, each of whose gender is assigned at birth. With theincreasing blurring of the concept of ‘male’ and ‘female’ as a result ofthe activities of the transgender category of LGBTTQQIAAP+ and thedeconstruction of “male” and “female” as gender concepts, the absenceof clear language on the acceptable sex of marriage partners in CAP 127is likely to render the legislation challenging in the face of theLGBTTQQIAAP+ movement. The Bill seeks to fill this gap by enactingspecific provisions on the required sex of persons who may celebrate‘marriage in Ghana. The purpose is to strengthen our laws to make them‘more robust, more encompassing and more stringent in dealing with theLGBTTQQIAAP+ activities and also provide a framework for thepromotion of desirable family values and social norms in the country.: Marriage and family are recognised as concepts that have deep-rootedsocial and cultural connotations that may differ largely from one society. to another. Several international protocols attest to the sensitive moralrie choices concerned with and the importance to be attached to theprotection of children and the fostering of secure family environments.Article 18(1) and (2) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rightsstates as follows:viionPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL, 2021Saalles“(1) The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall beprotected by the state, which shall take care ofits physical health and morals.(2) The State shall have the duty to assist thefamily which is the custodian ofmorals and traditional values recognised by the community.”Article 18(1) and (2) of the Charter is consistent with article 16 ofthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 23 of the InternationalCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 10 of the InternationalCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the sanctity offamilies as the basic unit of society and the duty of states to preservefamily and marriage as well as secure the protection of children.The rights of states to enact legislation to protect families is also acardinal principle in the 1978 Hague Convention on Celebration andRecognition of the Validity of Marriages. In Articles 11 and 14 of thesaid Convention, state-parties are entitled to refuse recognition tomarriages contracted in other jurisdictions if such marriages violate locallaws on bigamy, consanguinity, capacity, consent or are manifestlyincompatible with public policy. Though Ghana is not a signatory to theHague Convention, this principle of the right of states to determine thevalidity of marriages is a well-known principle of international law.On the issue of advocacy and other promotional activities, there iscurrently no legislation that specifically criminalises advocacy for, fundingof, promotion of or encouragement of LGBTTQQIAAP+ activitiesexcept the inchoate provisions in Act 29 namely, preparation forcommitting certain criminal offences, abetment of a criminal offence andconspiracy. This gap in the law creates opportunities for advocates ofLGBTTQQIAAP+ activities to sponsor and promote the proliferationof those sexual activities. The effect of these sponsorship and promotionis that young persons are lured to assimilate the otherwise unacceptableforms ofsexual expressions. Credible reports from the Coalition for ProperHuman Sexual Rights and Family Values indicate instances where youngpersons are promised travel opportunities, allowances and other gifts tocause them to engage in or advocate for LGBTTQQIAAP+. In someinstances, young persons, mostly students in colleges, are awarded“commission” for luring other young persons to join LGBTTQQIAAP+groups.viii/PROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021The existing legislative framework is also silent on supportmechanisms for victims of LGBTTQQIAAP+ sexual activities andpersons whose biological make-up makes them prone to “questioning”their sexuality. It is clear that economic inequalities and poverty create afertile environment for promoters of LGBTTQQIAAP+ activities to takeadvantage of poor youth and lure them into these activities. Recognisingthese vulnerable persons as victims of the exploitation of powerful forces,there is the need to enact legislation that creates support systems forpersons who are victims of lifestyle LGBTTQQIAAP+ persons.In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Agenda2030, which outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guideinternational development for the next decade. The global SDG indicatorframework also requires member states to contextualise and complementthe framework by establishing locally relevant indicators. The Bill isimportant for establishing and consolidating the relevant local indicatorson sexual expressions in accordance with the country’s developmentalneeds and its social and cultural values.The Bill aligns with the intended outcomes of the SDGs, in particular,Goal 3 which is to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-beingfor all at allages” and Goal 5 which calls on states to “achievegender equality andempowerall women andgirls”. The Bill also aligns with SDG Goal 10 which is to“reduce inequality within and among countries”. To this end, the Billemphasises the objectives of strengthening the Ghanaian family unit asthe basic unit of society, maintaining the binary gender construct of maleand female as the fundamental basis for formation of family and societywhile at the same time working to eliminate inequalities between malesand females in all areas ofnational development.Furthermore, the Bill seeks to contextualise SDG 10, target 10.3which requires states to “ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities ofoutcome, including by eliminating discriminatory laws, policies andpractices andpromoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard”. Infurtherance of target 10.3, the relevant global indicator being 10.3.1,measures the “Proportion ofpopulation reporting having personally feltdiscrin inated againetor hamasd in the previoustwelvemonths on the basis ofagroundofdiscrimination prohibited under international human rights”, the Billseeks to prohibit the abuse or harassment of persons suspected to beLGBTTQQIAAP+.ixPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021—_—Additionally, in order to appropriately deal with such claims of abuseor harassment within the Ghanaian social and cultural context, and todo so in a manner that prevents societal tensions arising from a clashbetween LGBTTQQIAAP+ norms, beliefs, and values and our traditionalGhanaian customs, beliefs and values, the Bill highlights the need torespect and promote Ghanaian family values as defined by customarylaw and enshrined in the 1992 Constitution. The Bill simultaneouslyextends opportunities for access to medical and psychological support toaffected persons to take advantage of those opportunities and to facilitatetheir integration into the larger society. Ultimately the Bill will contributeto ensuring that no one is left behind and that all citizens benefit from thenational development agenda.As Sponsorsofthe Bill, we also recognise that groups ofvulnerablepersons in the LGBTTQQIAAP+ discussion ought to receive support toaddress underlying biological, social and economic issues that make themprone to the rapacious activities of persons involved inLGBTTQQIAAP+ activities. Social support systems must be establishedto help the vulnerable persons understand their sexuality and to accesspsychological or physiological support where necessary.Furthermore, we are most concerned about the need to ensure thatthe overwhelming public abhorrence for LGBTTQQIAAP+ activities isnot channeled into mob justice or the meting out of instant justice topersons perceived to be participating in LGBTTQQIAAP+ activities.By prohibiting extra- judicial treatment including verbal abuse of suchpersons, the Bill seeks to prevent negative social treatment. This policy isin consonance with the appeal made by the National House of Chiefscalling on Ghanaians not to take the law into their own hands by way ofburning, lynching, molesting and visiting mayhem on suspectedLGBTTQQIAAP+ persons. Nananom in their statement advised thepublic to report such individuals to the law enforcement agencies fornecessary action.A suggestion to include specific inchoate offences related to theoffences created in the Bill is jettisoned as that would amount to surplusage.By reason of subsection (10) ofsection 25ofthe Interpretation Act, 2009(Act 792), where an enactment creates an offence, an attempt to committhat offence is an offence under the enactment and the attempt isxPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS AND/ GHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL, 2021punishable as if the offence itself had been committed. Similarly, sections20 and 23 ofthe Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29) create the offencesof abetment and conspiracy in respect of any criminal offence; thus, theprovisions should apply in respect of offences under the Billnotwithstanding the fact that the offences are created subsequent to Act29.Clauses 1 and 2 deal with the preliminary provisions. Clause I of theBill provides for the application of the Bill. The Bill applies to a person‘who holds out as a lesbian, a gay, a bisexual, a transgender, a transsexual,a queer, an ally, a pansexual, or a person of any other sociocultural notionof sex or sexual relationship that is contrary to the sociocultural notionsofmale and female or the relationship between male and female; a personwho may be questioning that person's sexuality; a person who has abiological anomaly regarding the gender assigned to the person at birth,including intersex; a person who is involved in the promotion of,propagation of, advocacy for, support of or funding ofLGBTTQQIAAP+; a person who provides or participates in theprovision of surgical services to enable gender reassignment or thecreation of a sexual category other than the category ofa person assignedat birth, except where the surgical procedure is to correct a biologicalanomaly, including intersex; and any other person engaged in a sexualactivity prohibited under the Bill.Clause 2 is the interpretation clause. The clause provides for theinterpretationofwords used in the Bill. Given the peculiar nature of theBill, it is proposed, despite the jurisdictional practice of placing theinterpretation clause at the end of a Bill, to have the interpretation clauseat the beginning, so as to aid referencing of the terms used throughoutthe Bill.: Clauses 3, 4 and 5 deal with proper human sexual rights and Ghanaianfamily values. Clause 3 imposes a duty on every citizen and in particular,parents, guardians, teachers, churches, mosques, other religious andtraditional institutions or organisations, the three arms of government,the media and creative arts industry, as well as relevant independentconstitutional bodies to promote and protect proper human sexual rightsand Ghanaian family values as defined in the Bill.

A person, otherthan the police, who receives such a report, is required to lodge a complaintwith the police within seven days of receipt of the report and assist thepolice in the investigation and prosecution of the matter.Clauses 6to 11 deal with LGBTTQQIAAP+ and related activities. Byclause 6, a person commits an offence if the person engages in sexualintercourse between or among persons of the same sex or between a manand an animal or a woman and an animal. The clause further prohibits aperson from marrying or purporting to marry a person who is of thesame sex as that person or holds out as a lesbian, a gay, a transgender, atranssexual, a queer, a pansexual, an ally, a non-binary or any other sexualor gender identity that is contrary to the binary categories of male andfemale. The clause also prohibits a person from providing or participatingin any form of procedure, including surgical procedure, that is intendedto create a sexual category other than the binary categories of male andfemale, except in the case of surgical procedures intended to correct abiological anomaly.

This provision recognises and aims atpreventing the activities of highly organised and funded movements andgroups that collaborate with local organisations, by the use of financialor other forms of support, to lure young and destitute Ghanaians intoLGBTTQQIAAP+ activities. This also provides a justification for theabsence of pecuniary penalties.xvPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL, 2021—_——i bs orClause 15 seeks to disband groups, societies, associations, clu!organisations existing before thecoming into force of the Bil whosePurposes, overt or covert, are wholly or in part to promote, a apisupport or sustain in any way, an act prohibited under the Bill.

These provisions are included as arecognitionof the distinction between lifestyle activists and persons who engage inthe acts prohibited by the Bill as a result of social, cultural, financial,medical, psychological or biological reasons. This is in recognition thatas minorities, these persons need the support, protection and love of themajority, to help them overcome their vulnerabilities and to give themoptions so they may be helped.Xvi/ PROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIANFAMILYVALUESBILL, 2021By clause 19, a person who is a victim of a sexual activity prohibitedunder the Bill should not be penalised for the involvement of the personin the sexual activity. Also, the court may order a person convicted of anoffence under the Bill to, in addition to the sentence imposed, paycompensation to the victim of the offence for any physical orpsychological harm caused to the victim. The clause further provides thatthe court, in determining the amount of compensation to be paid by theconvicted person, should take into consideration the extent of harmsuffered by the victim, the degree of force used on the victim and medicaland other expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the offence.Moreover, at any stage of investigation or trial of an offence under theBill, the law enforcement officer, prosecutor or any other person involvedin the investigation or trial is required to respect the right to privacy ofthe accused or complainant. In particular, proceedings involving childrenshould be held in camera.Clause 20 provides accused persons access to medical help ortreatment. A person is to be given access to the approved medical help ortreatment where the person, upon arrest, during police investigations,upon arraignment before court, in the course oftrial or at any time duringincarceration for the commission of an offence under the Bill, recantsand makes a voluntary request to access an approved medical help ortreatment. The cost for medical help or medical treatment may be borneby the person or an approved service provider, on behalf of the person.Clause 21 provides a flexible sentencing regime for persons foundliable for offences under the Bill.

This positions the Bill as asocial protection tool, rather than an instrument to exclude, discriminateagainst or victimise LGBTTQQIAAP+ persons.Clause 22 prohibits extra judicial treatment of persons accused ofoffences under the Bill. A significant part of the advocacy campaign ofLGBTTQQIAAP+ is against inhumane treatment of perceivedxviiPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTSGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2aLGBTTOQIAAP+ persons by homophobic persons. Aperson accusedof an offence or suffering from any gender or sexual identity 3*under the Bill should not be abused, assaulted or harassed whetherWi lyor physically. A person who abuses, assaults or harasses an accuse peaor a person suffering from any gender or sexual identitychal ongecommits an offence under the Bill and is, on summary conviction, liableto a term of imprisonment of not less than six months and not morethan three years. This provision accords with the general protectionsprovided in Chapter Five of the 1992 Constitution for persons accusedof criminal offences, particularly article 15(1) which stipulates that “thedignityofall persons shall be inviolable.” By prohibiting such acts,personsaccused of offences under the Bill are guaranteed fair treatment and trialand will be accorded the dignity that every citizen deserves.Clause 23 provides for assistance for persons designated as“questioning” and “intersex” under the Bill. Under this clause, theGovernment is empowered to liaise with an approved service providerto provide assistance in the form of therapy or any other assistancerelevant to the circumstance, to persons who may be questioning theirsex or fora parent whose child is intersex in order to, where necessary,assist the parent realign the child to the appropriate binary designationas determined by a medical practitioner. By identifying persons designatedas “questioning” and “intersex” for special treatment, the provision reflectsthe policy to provide support and assistance to persons who, forpsychological or biological reasons may become easy prey to lifestyleLGBTTQQIAAP+ persons.Clauses 24 and 25 deal with miscellaneous provisions. Clause 24empowers the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Gender,Children and Social Protection and the Minister for Health to makeRegulations. Clause 25 seeks to consequentially amend the ExtraditionAct, 1960 (Act 22) in the First Schedule to the effect that an offencecommitted under the Bill is an extraditable offence. *xviiiPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021—_—HON SAMUEL NARTEY GEORGEMPforNingo-PrampramDate: 29% June, 2021HON DELLA ADJOA SOWAHMPfor KpandoDate:29™ June, 2021HONEMMANUEL BEDZRAHMPfor Ho WestDate: 29* June, 2021HON JOHN NTIM FORJOURMPfor Assin SouthDate: 29® June, 2021HON ALHASSAN SAYIBU SUHUYINIMPfor Tamale NorthDate: 29\" June, 2021HON RITA NAA ODOLEY SOWAHMPfor La DadekotoponDate: 29* June, 2021HON HELEN ADJOA NTOSOMPfor Krachi WestDate: 29\" June, 2021XixGHTS ANDPROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RI ynGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL.————ROCKSON-NELSON DAFEAMEKPORMPfor South DayiDate: 29* June, 2021xx£PROMOTION OF PROPER HUMAN SEXUAL RIGHTS ANDGHANAIAN FAMILY VALUES BILL, 2021ARRANGEMENT OF SECTIONSSectionPreliminaryProvisions1.
