However, inclusion ofthese officers in the workplace often requires them to fit into prevailing police culture, meaning thatthe cultural changes expected in association with increased diversity are not achieved as readilyin police organisations. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with twenty police detectives,in this article, I assert that there are three core characteristics required of police officers needed topromote inclusion and acceptance in their workplace, regardless of their diversity status. Thesecharacteristics are cultural congruence, competence and team-player ability—together known as‘inclusion capital’. The definitions of these three inclusion capital characteristics are shaped by theprevailing police culture and organisational policy and are subject to change. An individual officer’sunderstanding and ability to prove these three characteristics are reflected in how well they areincluded and accepted amongst their colleagues. This paper contributes to previous findings onpolice culture using Bourdieu’s theories of ‘capital’ in a new way to explain how and why police areincluded in their workplace. It also describes how these findings might be used by police managersto improve workplace inclusion for all minoritised officers.Keywords: policing; police culture; diversity; workplace; inclusion; capital; Bourdieu; grounded theory1. IntroductionIn keeping with a broader global movement to increase diversity and inclusion inemployment, policing organisations are under pressure to increase diversity in their work-forces to make them representative of the communities they police. Employing morewomen, more people from minoritised ethnic and religious groups, more genders and morepeople with diverse abilities is posited as a positive step to ensure that police organisationsmeet societal expectations relating to diversity. However, diversity does not always meaninclusion in police workplaces, as ‘being there is not the same as being heard’ [1] (p. 182).In other words, officers from minoritised groups still need to navigate police culture to feelincluded, and this does not always mean embracing their own minority status. In addition,it does not mean that their presence will necessarily have the effect of changing policeculture in ways that are desired. Essentially, increasing diversity in police organisationscomes with a moral imperative to ensure that diversity is embraced, although pervasivepolice culture can prevent this from occurring.Sir Robert Peel’s maxim of ‘the police are the public and the public are the police’(cited in [2] (p. 100)) is often invoked as one of the reasons why police diversity shouldbe increased. Whereas diversity may not have been the central premise of this statementat the time it was made, current societal expectations do require police forces to be morerepresentative of the communities they serve [3]. In addition, it has been argued thatincreasing all kinds of diversity is beneficial both from a human rights perspective [4]and a business perspective [5]. As a human right, equal opportunity in employment isjust one reason why all individuals, regardless of diversity status, should be afforded theSocieties 2022, 12, 128. https://doi.org/10.3390/soc12050128 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/societiesSocieties 2022, 12, 128 2 of 19opportunity to become a police officer. For police organisations, the business perspectiveimplies that greater diversity will result in better outcomes in working with differentcommunities [6–9], as well as providing the organisation with alternate ideas to solvefuture problems that cannot be resolved with conventional thinking [10] and improvingoperational effectiveness [11]. In this paper, it is premised that a diverse workforce isimportant to ensure that police organisations are equipped to do their job effectivelyand fairly.1.1. Police DiversityResearch on police diversity tends to focus on categories of diversity, with women,ethnic minorities and sexual minorities the most prevalent in the literature. This categorisedapproach allows for knowledge about diverse identities to be teased out, as each categoryhas specific needs. Furthermore, the benefits that might be contributed by each categoryof diversity to the organisation can differ. For example, recruitment of minoritised ethnicpolice is seen as an avenue for engaging with minoritised ethnic communities [12,13],increasing the numbers of women is believed to be a way to change police culture andprovide a better workforce [14,15], and increasing the number of Muslim officers is believedto help in combatting terrorism [8]. These arguments all support the business case forincreased police diversity. It should also be noted that the term ‘diverse’ should only beused where there is a ‘norm’ or ‘typical’ officer. In the organisation subject to this research,the norm or typical police officer is a white, heterosexual male.The experiences of women police officers are the most prevalent in the literature,with their journey often described in terms of structural barriers and masculine police cul-ture that are difficult to shift [9]. For instance, the structural barrier regarding the physicalrequirements of officers initially excluded women from recruitment (and acceptance) inpolicing. However, as physical requirements were met by more women, the resistanceregarding employment of female police officers shifted from physical competencies totheir commitment to their job in light of childcare and other family requirements [16,17],which represents another structural barrier. Masculine police culture, which will be dis-cussed below, is also referenced in the literature as a barrier to women being included inthe workplace [18,19].Whereas structural barriers predominantly affect women, cultural issues are men-tioned more often in the literature about officers from minoritised ethnic groups, with per-ceptions of a racist culture amongst police representing a significant barrier to the recruit-ment of minoritised ethnic officers across the globe [20–24]. In addition, studies haveindicated that trust has been an issue between officers with a white identity and officerswith a minoritised ethnic identity [14,25]. As such, a perception of racist culture is arecruitment barrier for officers from different ethnic or religious minority backgrounds.This lack of trust has also been reported for Muslim officers, exacerbated by the focuson Islamic terrorism and subsequent negative dealings between Muslim communities andthe police [6]. These tensions between Muslim communities and police organisations createa further barrier to Muslim officers being recruited and retained.Acceptance of LGB (lesbian, gay and bisexual) police officers has increased over timebecause homosexuality has been broadly decriminalised; however, similarly to the accep-tance of women in policing, there is a stronger likelihood that LGB officers will be includedif they fit in to the masculine police culture [26–28]. In addition, the homosexuality ofofficers tends not to be an issue when the officer has demonstrated that they are professionalwith a good work ethic [29,30]. As such, LGB police officers are accepted in the workplace,provided they fit with the prevailing heteronormative culture of the organisation.1.2. Police CulturePolice culture has been extensively studied, described and critiqued globally, oftenwith negative connotations [31]. Across policing literature, police culture has been de-scribed as masculine [32,33], racist [7,34], enduring [35,36], changing as a result of societalSocieties 2022, 12, 128 3 of 19expectations [37], made up of multiple cultures [38–40] and a culture that overrides othercultures when an officer joins [41]. Some scholars argue that police culture is negativeand requires change [7], whereas others attribute negative aspects of police culture to thedifficult nature of police work [31,42]. Regardless of these varied, complex and some-times contradictory definitions, increasing diversity and inclusion in policing organisationscannot be considered without some understanding of police culture.The assertion that police culture is masculine has been made throughout the literature,linking masculine culture with perceptions about what ‘important’ police work is. Thisincludes prioritising operational rather than community policing [37], requiring particularphysical traits [32,33] and seeing bravado and tough responses by police as the ideal [43].Whereas descriptions of police culture as masculine are widely accepted, the notion of policeculture having one ‘masculinity’ has been disputed, as some authors question whethermasculine police culture should be described through a hegemonic masculinity lens [44].Rather, masculine police culture, as well as police culture in general, might be described asmultifaceted, as per assertions made in various contexts in other police culture literature(see [38–40]). Therefore, it is also open to the perception and subjectivity of the individualand their own experience, although similarities are often found.Female officers are a relatively new addition to policing [45], so assertions of a mas-culine culture are perhaps not surprising. Whether there are multiple masculine culturesor one, masculine culture in policing has contributed to women’s experiences as officersbecause they are subjected to unwanted sexual harassment and sexualised banter [46–50].This leads them to make difficult decisions about whether to report poor behaviour or tojust accept it, as reporting poor behaviour can leave them on the outer. This reluctanceto report poor behaviour is also asserted in the literature about minoritised ethnic policeofficers, as the culture has also been described as racist (see [7,34]), albeit with a reductionin overt racism over time [51].Whereas racist police culture is usually linked to racism toward community mem-bers, it has also been posited that within policing organisations, officers of minoritisedethnic status are required to prove themselves in order to be included [13,52]. As such,minoritised ethnic officers will tolerate racist behaviour to ensure an easier transition intothe workplace [25]. Similar to female officers’ perceptions and experiences of masculinepolice culture, whether an officer identified as being of minoritised ethnic or racial statusperceives conversation and behaviour as racist will depend on individual perceptions andtheir ability to fit in [41].It has been asserted that an officer being racist does not necessarily mean that they willengage in racist behaviour toward community members [31,37]. Rather, they may speak ina racist way while around other officers, but when dealing with community members, theymay conduct themselves fairly. This assertion is disputed in multiple forums, especiallyfollowing the Macpherson Report [53] in the United Kingdom [54] and the Black LivesMatter movement in the United States [55]. For example, in Australia, there is a significanthistory of Aboriginal people being disproportionately represented in the criminal justicesystem compared to the rest of the population (see [56]). However, one study of Aboriginalwomen police officers in Australia found that systemic racial or sexual discrimination wasnot widely reported [57], meaning that this racism may be perceived and experienced moreacutely by community members than by Aboriginal officers themselves. Further researchis needed in this space regarding experiences of police officers from different minoritisedethnic and religious groups, including their own perceptions of racist police culture.Given that police officers from minoritised groups often change their behaviour to fitthe norm (see [12,14,27,58]), increasing diversity may not necessarily change police culturebecause minoritised officers are likely to conform to the prevailing culture. This createsa quandary regarding cultural change and how to encourage all officers to celebrate andappreciate everyone’s characteristics of diversity to ensure that these characteristics areof benefit to the police organisation and the community and to ensure that all officers arecomfortable to be themselves at work. It has been argued that an individual’s attitude maySocieties 2022, 12, 128 4 of 19be more important than their diversity characteristics [22,59], meaning that the officer’sability to accept the diversity of others (regardless of their own diversity status) could havea greater impact than increasing diversity in itself.Interestingly, police organisational policies are often designed with cultural changein mind [7], although it has been stated that societal expectations are likely to have agreater effect on changing police culture [37]. Whereas some authors comment that policeculture is enduring [36], it might be said that this is in relation to specific aspects ofpolice culture, such as loyalty. The question is not whether police cultural change ispossible but which factors make it possible and what is the best way to instigate change.Difficulties in implementing cultural change through policy have been connected withenduring cultural knowledge [60,61] because police officers have been found to havetheir own ways of keeping cultural practices [62]. However, changing policies does notalways translate to a change in behaviour [27,37]. When societal expectations create changein police organisations, this is likely to have greater effect within the organisation [37].Ideally, policy changes would be in line with societal expectations, meaning that bothcontribute to a positive and meaningful impact on police culture. This needs to be drivenby the organisation in a way that carefully considers prevailing culture, depending onthe circumstances of the organisation rather than targeting inclusion strategies to any onediversity category [63,64].Whereas police diversity literature categorises officers into groups with respect todiversity status, this may not be the best approach for policy implementation to increaseinclusion. For example, research suggests some police officers feel that minoritised officersare gaining a workplace advantage when they use a policy designed to assist them [65].As such, it is reasonable to suggest that a holistic approach to diversity is required to ensureinclusion in police workplaces. This is not to say that entitlements should be taken awayfrom minoritised officers, but a more nuanced approach is needed to ensure a perceptionof fairness, as well as fairness in practice [65]. It also means that as further categories ofdiversity are discovered, policy should be designed to facilitate the needs of these categorieswithout increasing levels of bureaucracy.It is also argued that a different managerial approach to diversity is needed, takinginto account the effects of policy and police culture on inclusion for the individual withinthat organisation’s unique context. Whereas police culture has a significant effect on anofficer’s inclusion, it is not the only factor. To explain this further, Bourdieu’s [66] theoriesof habitus, field and capital were used in this research.1.3. Bourdieu’s Social Theory and Police CultureBourdieu [66] theorised that the social world could be described using several conceptsthat are intrinsically linked and complex, and his work relates closely to the ways in whichpolice culture works in practice. Therefore, the findings of this research build on Bourdieu’stheories of habitus, field and, in particular, capital [66] as an explanation of what policeofficers intrinsically need to be included in their workplace. Although described separately,the three concepts (habitus, field and capital) interact with each other constantly to makeup the social world, and they are each continually reproduced over time unless a significantchange is made to one of them.According to Bourdieu [67,68], ‘habitus’ refers to an individual’s understanding ofhow the social world works. Throughout life, an individual is exposed to their own uniqueexperiences, resulting in their own personal perceptions of external structures and systems;these structures and systems are known as ‘fields’. When an individual accepts their ownpersonal understanding (habitus), change is difficult to implement because they cannot seea reason for change [68,69]. In other words, when individuals believe that the social worldis how it should be, without challenging their own understanding, they are less likely toembrace change. In the context of police officers who fit into police culture, those who donot challenge their own habitus are likely to accept and replicate the culture, meaning thatSocieties 2022, 12, 128 5 of 19police cultural change will not come easily. This is referred to as ‘doxa’ [66] and will bediscussed further below.‘Field’ refers to the rules and structures of institutions and hierarchies [70], meaningthat the structures and rules of a policing organisation are part of the field. For instance,formal policies and procedures surrounding recruitment, promotion and retention of policeofficers are part of the field, although this term might also be applied to the more informalfield of police culture.Fields are organised around ‘capital’, so officers with high levels of capital tend tooccupy higher positions in the field. ‘Capital’ can be described as anything an individualpossesses that is valuable within the field, and this ‘capital’ contributes to how much powereach individual has [71]. Bourdieu [71] described the main types of capital (economic,cultural and social) but reasoned that there are other types of capital. Those with higherlevels of capital have more power; therefore, they are in a better position to shape the field.Using capital, they can choose to replicate power structures or to change them, dependingon what they believe is necessary as part of their habitus (or beliefs). This means that thosewith power can replicate the structures that allowed them to gain power and capital inthe first place [72,73]. In effect, those with the most power are able to keep their power byensuring that structures do not change in a way that takes away their power. Of course,they may also choose to use their power to assist in change processes.As previously stated, Bourdieu [71] described different types of capital, includingeconomic, cultural and social capital, each with a different part to play in the social world.For the current research, the additional concept of ‘inclusion capital’ was applied; that is,there are certain elements required of a police officer to ensure their inclusion amongstcolleagues in the workplace. It should be noted that in this research, having higher levelsof inclusion capital (or power) does not necessarily equate to a higher police rank—it islinked more to inclusion and influence over others in the workplace. As such, the habitus(or beliefs) of a person with high levels of inclusion capital are important because they havethe potential to shape the field (or in this case, inclusion culture) of the organisation.Whereas knowledge regarding how police officers are included in their workplaceis important, it is asserted that this knowledge can be used to implement positive changein policing organisations. This can be done under the premise that individuals are morelikely to change when they can see that the change is required and appropriate. Anotherconcept described by Bourdieu [66] is ‘doxa’—when an individual accepts their socialworld as the way it should be rather than questioning whether change is required. If anindividual has ‘doxa’, they will continue to replicate the same field (or structure), and if thatindividual has a high level of capital (or power), they are in a better position to ensure thisreplication continues [74]. When referring to inclusive practice in police organisations, doxaoccurs when police officers accept the status quo of their organisational culture withoutquestion. If an individual has high levels of capital and they also have doxa, they areunlikely to readily engage in any cultural change processes [75,76]. This makes culturalchange harder to implement through a top-down management approach because theofficers being asked to change cannot see any reason to do so. Furthermore, they mayresist the change or find ways around it. However, it has been asserted that habitus canbe changed through reflexivity [77,78], meaning that doxa does not always continue in anindividual. Conversely, change is not always necessary, and encouraging reflexivity allowspolice managers to consider this carefully before change implementation programs are putin place [79].1.4. Research ContributionThe findings presented in this paper contribute to knowledge about police culture byarticulating the ways in which police officers are included in their workplaces, regardlessof diversity status. This is in keeping with previous scholarly assertions that differences donot always correlate with background characteristics [80,81] and provides an explanation ofwhy some minoritised officers are accepted and included whereas others are not. A descrip-Societies 2022, 12, 128 6 of 19tion of how the individual inclusion process takes place in one large police organisationin Australia will be provided, along with an outline of how this information can be usedas a holistic approach to diversity policy formulation and analysis, thereby encouragingincreased inclusion.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Theoretical ApproachThe research was conducted using constructivist grounded theory methods. In contrastto more traditional social research, grounded theory research is conducted by collectingand analysing data prior to making hypotheses, with theory arising throughout or afterthe data analysis process [82]. Grounded theory is commonly used in practice-basedprofessions [83], with the founders of grounded theory, Glaser and Strauss, asserting that‘practical applications—predictions and explanation should be able to give the practitionerunderstanding and some control of situations’ (cited in [84] (p. 24)). For this research,this practitioner-based approach has been applied to policing.Grounded theory was initially proposed within a positivist approach (and some re-searchers still apply it this way), but over time, it was argued that a constructivist approachwas also required [85]. Constructivism requires the researcher to acknowledge and takeinto account the ways in which individual realities are constructed through both social andindividual means [86]. For example, an individual police officer may come to an organisa-tion with their own beliefs and understandings of reality, but these may change over timeas they become more familiar with organisational culture. Alternately, their individualunderstanding may remain completely distinct from organisational understandings.Constructivist grounded theory allows for the researcher’s experiences to be includedin the research rather than an expectation that they will be completely objective [87].The researcher must also acknowledge that they bring their own level of knowledge tothe data analysis process. This is especially important for social researchers who arealso practitioners, as an entirely objective approach cannot be claimed. Therefore, as theresearcher of the current study was a serving police officer at the time of the research,constructivist grounded theory was deemed the most appropriate. It is acknowledged thatthe researcher added knowledge to the data [88] while maintaining a reflexive approach [89]to coding and analysis.2.2. Participant RecruitmentParticipants were initially recruited via an email sent to officers within a large com-mand of police detectives. Participants were from a range of backgrounds, includingwhite heterosexual male officers who fit the ‘norm’, various minoritised ethnic groupsand women. During the first round of interviews, snowball sampling was used to recruitadditional participants. Targeted sampling based on data analysis was also used to recruitpolice officers from specific minoritised groups, such as Muslim officers. Targeted samplingwas attempted for LGB participants, however this was unsuccessful. All participants werepolice detectives ranging in rank from Detective Senior Constable to Detective Inspector.Prior to interviews, all participants were informed that their participation was voluntary,with signed consent forms obtained in accordance with Western Sydney University HumanResearch Ethics Committee Approval: H11100.2.3. Data CollectionIn total, forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty sworn policedetectives, as each participant was interviewed twice. Three fictional vignettes about threepolice officers with varying diversity characteristics were presented to each participantduring their first interview. These vignettes referred to a female general duties officer onmaternity leave who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, a femaledetective who was perceived by colleagues as low in competence and had just disclosedto colleagues that she was in a same-sex relationship and a male officer with a MuslimSocieties 2022, 12, 128 7 of 19name who was training to become a tactical operative. Interview participants were askedto read each vignette and answer the same series of open-ended questions about theirinitial reaction and the main issues they felt were raised, as well as how they felt col-leagues and managers would react to the scenario. Key points were probed further as theywere discovered.2.4. Data AnalysisData were analysed through constant comparative analysis, whereby initial incidentsin the data are coded and then formed into categories. In constant comparative analysis,as additional data are collected, they are compared with previous codes and categories.This process is ongoing throughout the data collection process, with the aim of generatinga theory that arises from the data [90].Initial interviews were transcribed and coded line by line upon completion, resultingin several categories. When theoretical saturation or repetition categories occurred with nonew categories arising, the first round of interviews was completed. The categories wereformed into a set of hypotheses as follows:Hypothesis 1. Police officers are accepted by their colleagues through fitting into the culture orthrough a perception of competence of both.Hypothesis 2. Police officers perceive difference and diversity as a problem to be solved rather thana benefit to the organisation.Hypothesis 3. Muslim officers are regarded with a greater level of suspicion than other officers.Hypothesis 4. A disconnect exists between officers’ understandings of official policy on diversityand the belief systems and practice displayed by those officers.These initial hypotheses were then tested in the second round of semi-structuredinterviews using more targeted questions with the same participants. A further hypothesiswas identified during this set of interviews, as constant data analysis occurred throughoutthe data collection process:Hypothesis 5. Police officers perceive diversity initiatives in the organisation to be somewhat unfair.The transcripts of this second round of interviews were also coded line by line, with thehypotheses being further analysed through constant comparative analyses in accordancewith grounded theory methods [90]. This analysis resulted in three clear elements requiredof police officers if they are to be included in their workplace. These elements were named‘inclusion capital’ elements and will be discussed in the Results section. With the knowledgeof the three inclusion capital elements, further analysis was conducted of all data relatingto participants’ understanding of organisational policy, especially relating to Hypothesis5, as it was a newer hypothesis. A theory was then developed with respect to how to usethese inclusion capital elements to guide the enhancement and development of inclusionand diversity policies and strategies.2.5. Methodological LimitationsWhereas this study speaks to the importance of inclusion capital in relation to diversityand inclusion in policing, there are some methodological limitations that should be con-sidered. In terms of the generalisability of the findings, the limited sample size of twentydetectives cannot be generalised to the larger organisation or in relation to other Australianpolice organisations. Furthermore, not all minoritised groups were represented in theinterview cohort or the case studies. In particular, there were no Aboriginal participants,and they were not mentioned in the case studies. As such, Aboriginal police officers shouldbe a focus of future research in this space. Whereas there were no LGB participants, theirSocieties 2022, 12, 128 8 of 19experiences were discussed by participants. It is also acknowledged that further research isrequired to confirm the effectiveness of changing policy in line with the inclusion capitalelements. Future research could also focus on other police organisations and their owndefinitions of inclusion capital, as well as whether implementing policy change based onknown inclusion capital elements has a significant impact on inclusion for all officers.3. Results3.1. Inclusion CapitalThe findings of this research draw heavily on and add to Bourdieu’s [66,71] theory ofsocial and cultural capital by first describing the traits and characteristics that police officersmust demonstrate and maintain amongst their colleagues to be included in the workplace.The traits and characteristics outlined here are called ‘inclusion capital’. Whereas Bour-dieu [71] gave broad definitions regarding what constitutes social and cultural capital,the inclusion capital elements in this study are defined specifically for the organisation andcohort studied in this research.In keeping with Bourdieu’s [66] theory that individuals with large amounts of capitalhave more power, the findings presented here are that officers with large amounts ofinclusion capital are more included and accepted amongst colleagues. Conversely, officerswho are unable to gain or maintain inclusion capital do not feel included in the workplace,and other officers do not see them as an integral part of their work group. In the cohortincluded in this study, three inclusion capital elements were identified: cultural congruence,competence, and team-player ability.3.1.1. Having Cultural Congruence as an Inclusion Capital ElementAn officer with cultural congruence fits into the informal, social side of police cul-ture. Cultural congruence is closely aligned with the traditional notion of ‘police culture’,as described elsewhere in policing literature (for examples, see [7,31,37,91]), albeit withsome differences. In essence, having cultural congruence means an officer takes part inor, at the very least, accepts workplace social norms. For example, participants describedofficers who demonstrated cultural congruence as participating in the ‘boys’ club’, passingthe ‘attitude test’ by accepting the status quo of the prevailing culture and changing toconform to the culture if they did not naturally fit in.Participating in the boys’ club requires an officer to be part of a masculinised work-place, including drinking alcohol and taking part in workplace banter. The boys’ clubis characterised in other literature in terms of a clique in which masculine behaviour isrequired to fit in to the team [92,93]; this concept was confirmed in this research:‘My initial response to fit into the cops, I think male, I think young, I think gym junkie1,I think a bit of a boys’ club, bit of a drinker . . . ’Participant 2‘He doesn’t fit into the culture, maybe that’s because he doesn’t booze, maybe he doesn’tcheat on his wife, maybe he doesn’t participate in childish behaviour that people findamusing, maybe that’s not how he fits into that little group of people that just want to getreally fit and do those sorts of things.’Participant 5‘You do get that sort of boys’ club mentality . . . ’Participant 18Drinking alcohol and socialising was discussed by participants as one way to be partof the boys’ club, with a failure to drink alcohol meaning that inclusion was more difficultto attain:‘We have a lot of non-drinkers in our section, in our squad, and it’s not frowned upon but. . . function time comes around and . . . it’s like “Oh, they don’t drink”’Participant 7Societies 2022, 12, 128 9 of 19‘They like to play hard and then drink and (if) he doesn’t drink . . . he’s not part ofthat culture.’Participant 8‘It’s part of our Australian culture . . . it’s a huge part of our culture, if there’s a deaththey have a drink, if a baby’s born, they have a drink, if you get promoted you have a drink. . . in the drinking no, I don’t (fit in).’Participant 18Muslim participants discussed this issue in particular because they felt they wererequired to drink alcohol as a demonstration that they could be trusted, with Muslimparticipants stating:‘I think these days . . . fitting in a team has also got to do with some social aspects offitting into a team, be it drinking or going out to a pub and stuff like that . . . ’Participant 16‘Fitting in . . . unfortunately when you say fitting in, for me alcohol and socialising is abig thing that comes up and being one of the boys . . . ’Participant 18Taking part in masculinised workplace banter is another way for officers to demon-strate cultural congruence as part of the boys’ club. Participants discussed how those whowere perceived to be ‘different’ were often the target of this banter:‘It’s like there’s no filter, it’s like we just talk about anything, whatever comes into yourhead . . . and they forget a woman’s there . . . it’s not offensive but . . . there’s no filter,you hear things and you’re just thinking, are you really saying that in front of me . . . ’Participant 11‘I do joke and say to blokes who I do know, you’re fucking hopeless seriously, have youthought of another career choice, or the little, short ones . . . you have a joke with him, youknow what if we still had a height restriction I wouldn’t be having this stupid conversationwith you . . . ’Participant 17However, it was noted that officers from all backgrounds took part in banter:‘the Sergeant’s a bloke called Smith, the sole white bloke, and . . . it’s the best because wealways make fun of the little white bloke . . . because we can!’Participant 7 (minoritised ethnicity)‘In my office, it’s quite diverse, we’ve got a lot of different nationalities, and we’ve got lotsof people with different types of religion and they’re quite vocal, our office is quite vocaland there’s a lot of banter around . . . ’Participant 5Interestingly, participants agreed that this banter often did not comply with policy,including sexual harassment policy and policy on respectful workplaces:‘There’s always a line of . . . general sort of piss take2 to outright people just beingdiscriminatory I guess . . . ’Participant 4‘The boys aren’t going to be PC3 so we’re just going to be in for complaints and costs andall that sort of stuff if complaints do come out.’Participant 6Willingness to comply with current cultural values is another way for officers todemonstrate cultural congruence. This is also known as the ‘attitude test’. Passing theattitude test means that an officer accepts the status quo of the prevailing culture, regardlessSocieties 2022, 12, 128 10 of 19of whether they agree with the culture, and does not complain about issues if they donot agree:‘People who complain get frowned upon.’Participant 3‘Your co-workers probably just want to see that you can fit in, you’re not going to causeconflict or anything like that . . . you show that you’re not combative and that you acceptother people’s opinions and stuff like that . . . ’Participant 4‘Being part of the norm, not upsetting anyone, just being willing to relinquish your viewsfor the good of the team.’Participant 8Accepting the status quo was linked to trust in colleagues, which is a necessary partof police work, considering the dangerous situations officers face together. However,this acceptance of the status quo can also include ignoring or taking part in poor behaviour,such as sexual harassment or bullying, in order to ‘fit in’. This indicates a blurring of theboundaries between trust in dangerous situations (a clear time when trust is important)and trust in situations when the officer may be doing something inappropriate:‘You have to be able to trust the person next to you 110 percent and if you don’t fit intothat culture, that could ruin the whole unit itself . . . ’Participant 10‘People become cautious about interacting with somebody who’s potentially likely to usethings they say or use things that they do against them, it’s a self defence mechanism thatpeople utilise to avoid coming under scrutiny themselves . . . ’.Participant 13For some participants, demonstrating cultural congruence through being part of theboys’ club or passing the attitude test meant they changed their own behaviour to ensurethey were accepted:‘When I first started, I started playing football and every Wednesday you’d play football,they’d want me to drink . . . I wasn’t a drinker, I didn’t drink . . . Everything was basedon the culture of drinking and that’s what formed your camaraderie if you like . . . ’Participant 18‘It’s not about hiding, it’s like your belief system . . . you sit there with someone in the carand then you see them say Leb4 this, Leb that, wog5 this, go back to your country, fuck offyou fool, all this sort of stuff. Now you know all this stuff is wrong and they shouldn’tbe saying it, but yet if you mention your belief that you don’t agree with what they’resaying then you’re going to ostracise yourself . . . ’Participant 19Although cultural congruence has been described here, there was evidence of culturalchange in keeping with general societal change, demonstrating that this definition couldchange in the future. For example, participants discussed how they bonded over coffeerather than drinking alcohol and that the culture was changing to include working onphysical fitness:‘The boys in that team, they train together . . . ’Participant 1‘Just in morning coffee and all the rest of it he gets involved in the banter . . . ‘Participant 3‘He shared some of the same habits and hobbies of most of the guys, he liked to train, he likedhis footy . . . ’Societies 2022, 12, 128 11 of 19Participant 18As such, the above description of cultural congruence is subject to change over time—an indication that police culture can and does change in line with societal expectations,as noted by Reiner [37].3.1.2. Having Competence as an Inclusion Capital ElementCompetence is an important characteristic for workers in any workplace, and polic-ing is no different. This study revealed that competence is a key characteristic requiredfor a police officer to be included amongst colleagues. Among the study cohort, compe-tence includes having a strong work ethic and understanding the work being conducted.Interestingly, for a police officer to be deemed ‘competent’, both formally and informally,they must have the same characteristics and skill sets at the same standard as their col-leagues, regardless of whether they have extra skills that may be of benefit to the team theywork with. This contrasts with arguments advocating for more diversity to ensure differentskill sets in the workplace, as in practice, officers are expected to be the same as each other.For the most part, what participants deemed to be ‘competence’ related to formalorganisational policy, especially relating to recruitment, training and promotion criteria,such as English language proficiency or physical fitness levels. The expectation is that allofficers pass the same thresholds:‘Doesn’t matter whether they’re twenty or whether they’re fifty, they’ve still got to pass.’Participant 1‘If he’s capable and he’s able and he’s passing everything and he gets through all that stuff,I don’t think anyone would care less . . . ’Participant 13‘I think it’s a good thing, as long the (organisation) maintains the level of standard thatthe people that are entering with these backgrounds and cultures can carry out theirduties competently and properly.’Participant 18However, the perception of other participants is that competence is more nuanced inthe workplace. For example, an officer who meets the required organisational competenciesstill needs to informally demonstrate that they are as capable of the same tasks as theircolleagues and that they maintain their skills and knowledge to a high level. This means ifan officer is not able to understand or complete tasks at the same level as their colleagues,they may be seen as incompetent, regardless of whether they are of minoritised statusor not:‘We had a guy who was everybody’s mate, everyone liked him, but he was probably themost incompetent investigator I had and failed the D’s course6 and is now in uniform inthe country. But was a top bloke and everyone liked, but was incompetent.’Participant 8This incompetence is perceived even when officers possess extra diverse skill sets,such as speaking a second language. In essence, diverse skill sets are not valued in relationto competency. Rather, these skills are seen as ‘helpful’ for those who do have the requisiteskill sets at high levels. For example, participants described officers from minoritised ethnicgroups as ‘helpers’:‘I used to say . . . we have to get more, I thought it was a positive, there’s . . . a lot ofChinese descent and Asian descent officers working at (name of police station) and theywere such a help . . . ’Participant 3‘We’ve got officers that are Middle Eastern, and they help us . . . ’Participant 5Societies 2022, 12, 128 12 of 19However, participants also indicated that these ‘helping’ officers did not have a highlevel of understanding:‘You’ll be working on a job and a particular language comes up and . . . someone cancome in straight away and speak it, if they don’t speak the Australian language as welland aren’t across our culture it all falls apart.’Participant 2‘If you were a Chinese young bloke coming into the police force and . . . you had beenraised in a very Chinese family, I’ve worked with guys like that, they’re very nice guys,well intentioned and all the rest of it but . . . you need to explain things to them becausethey just don’t get it sometimes . . . ’Participant 3As such, ‘helpers’ are likely to find inclusion in the workplace more challengingbecause they are not regarded as ‘competent’ individuals; their ability to demonstrate‘competence’ in an inclusion capital context is not as great as those who have the same skillsas their colleagues.The participants also inferred that inclusion capital relating to competency is moredifficult to gain in comparison to the other two inclusion capital elements (cultural con-gruence and team-player ability). An officer needs more time to demonstrate competencewhen they first join a workplace, as opportunities may not immediately arise to do so.In contrast, the other two elements can be demonstrated relatively easily through socialinteraction with colleagues.3.1.3. Being a Team-Player as an Inclusion Capital ElementPolicing as a ‘team sport’ or officers working as a ‘team’ was strongly indicated to beof importance by the research participants:‘It’s a team sport, policing.’Participant 3‘They don’t need to strive for promotion or anything else, but you need to be a part of theteam environment and contribute in a good way, not just for your own benefit, for thebenefit of your peers and for the benefit of what our role is, which is for the community . . . ’Participant 9‘You have to have the ability to fit into a team environment and work with others . . . ’Participant 13‘The reason to get along with your colleagues, it’s the team principle that has to be drivenhome . . . ’Participant 17As such, ‘being a team-player’ is the third inclusion capital element. As officers oftenneed to rely on one another for their own personal safety in varying levels of difficultyand danger [39], this is not a surprising finding. In this research, it was found that a‘team-player’ is an officer who makes a positive contribution to the team and is availableand reliable. For example, participants suggested that making a positive contribution canbe shown by an officer by taking on their fair share of the team’s workload, keeping upmorale, getting along with colleagues and being loyal to the team:‘Getting the work done, contributing to the team and working towards the goals of theplace . . . ’Participant 9‘You spend a majority of your time with your colleagues at work and if you don’t getalong with them . . . and you’re abrasive with the rest of the team then that’s difficult towork with . . . it’s going to take away from . . . the whole team’s efficiency, if people haveto deal with personalities more.’Societies 2022, 12, 128 13 of 19Participant 10‘Being part of a team, being in the team environment trying to achieve team goals andthat could mean work wise, it could also be fitting in socially. Not being selfish. I supposeto the culture of the work environment, being a team-player.’Participant 12‘Just basically being a team-player . . . they actually sort of volunteer themselves . . .to help others and stuff like that when required, I think that sort of makes the officeenvironment fairly comfortable.’Participant 15‘I guess in that regards fitting in would be if you fit into that type of mindset . . . thework ethic, and just being able to operate as part of a team. It’s very hard if you’re not inthat team.’Participant 20Accordingly, being available and reliable means an officer does not leave work forother officers to do (including working overtime when necessary to get the work done) andensuring that they look after their colleagues.In practice, demonstrating team-player attributes can often overlap with the otherinclusion capital elements. For example, participants indicated that being a team-playercan involve a combination of inclusion capital attributes:‘Reliable, being reliable . . . Being part of a team, being in the team environment trying toachieve team goals and that could mean work wise, it could also be fitting in socially.’Participant 12‘In relation to fitting in, I think my understanding is being part of a team, understandingwhat needs to be done and just doing it, I think fitting in a team has also got to do withsome social aspects of fitting into a team, be it drinking or going out to a pub and stufflike that . . . ’Participant 16Being a team-player can also be linked to either of the other two inclusion capitalelements to increase inclusion for individual officers. In other words, whereas definitionsare provided for each inclusion capital element in this research, these elements are fluid inpractice, in keeping with Bourdieu’s theory [66]. For instance, an officer who is part of theboys’ club (which is part of their cultural congruence inclusion capital) will also be seen asa team-player because they get along with colleagues and keep up morale:‘He’s one of the boys . . . he talks footy, talks chicks . . . he’s just a blokey bloke and getsalong with all the guys . . . ’Participant 7‘You need morale, you can be the world’s best detective, but you can be effectively ineptin social skills which means no-one will work with you and no-one will back you whichmeans you’re taking on a much more high workload because no-one wants to help youand you can’t effectively do your work as an individual. What we do is a team sport,and you can’t do it on your own.’Participant 8‘They’re good to have around for morale . . . ’Participant 10An officer who is highly competent in their work (part of their competency inclusioncapital) is reliable:‘(I would choose) . . . the reliability of someone competent who you can rely on . . . ’Participant 12Societies 2022, 12, 128 14 of 19‘Competent is someone who is capable and has an understanding of the work and cancarry out the work to a standard that’s acceptable, and someone you can rely upon.’Participant 18The definition of an officer who is not a ‘team-player’ provides useful insights intothe ways in which officers are included and excluded because it is not necessarily theopposite of the team-player description. Non-team players question the status quo and canbe perceived to act in their own interest rather than those of their teammates. This findingis connected to the idea of officers being culturally congruent, whereby officers must acceptthe prevailing culture to fit in:‘If he came in and had an attitude that ‘I already know or we do it differently here’ . . .that would leave him on the outer . . . ’Participant 9‘Everyone has different opinions on things, and I might have opinions on things, but Ihave to be sensitive when I’m expressing them . . . it’s not going to make you fit into theteam very well if you’re . . . sprouting of 7 things and pissing people off you know . . . ’Participant 10When an officer is perceived to mostly act in their own self-interest, they are also anon-team player:‘I look at some people and think you arrogant arsehole, competency comes as a groupas well, not just as an individual and especially when you work on some really . . .confronting jobs, every little input from each person counts and as silly as that sounds. . . it’s a domino effect, it’ll upset the troops, morale goes down, everything else starts tofall around you.’Participant 2This is true regardless of whether the reasons for an officer acting as such are beyondtheir control. Competing personal needs that make an officer regularly unavailable, such aschildcare requirements, were perceived by participants as acting in their own self-interestrather than for the good of the team:‘I used to work with a lady that came back one day a week and . . . by the time you clearyour emails, and you had a chit chat in the corridor, I don’t see why you’re botheringbeing at work.’Participant 5‘If you then had fifty percent of your workforce only there part-time or casually or notcommitted to being available, being prepared to travel, being prepared to work overtime,being flexible in respect to the workplace and being committed to being at the workplaceas opposed to being at the home, that would be very detrimental as far as managing ateam goes . . . ’Participant 13‘Females have already caused issues in (name of command) for example. They cause issuesin most detectives’ offices, just work part-time, I know it’s sexist, but it does affect therunning of an office . . . ’Participant 14This definition regarding what officers must do or not do to be seen as a team-playeroverlaps significantly with the other two inclusion capital elements, thereby demonstratingthe interaction between all inclusion capital elements in practice. Again, in keeping withBourdieu’s [66] original assertions, these definitions should be viewed as fluid and subjectto change.Societies 2022, 12, 128 15 of 194. DiscussionThe inclusion capital elements of cultural congruence, competence and being a team-player closely align with other studies on police culture (for example, see [7,31,37,39,91–93]).The findings presented in this research further suggest that in practice, the elements ofinclusion capital come together to impact an individual officer’s overall levels of inclusionin the workplace. Ideally, the officer will have all three inclusion capital elements, but if theydo not, it is still possible for them to be accepted by colleagues using the other two. The bestway to describe the nuances regarding how this occurs is to imagine that each officer hasan ‘inclusion account’, similar to a bank account, where they bank all three elements ofinclusion capital. Together, this adds up to their overall inclusion and acceptance levelsamongst colleagues. Having high levels of inclusion capital means the officer will feel moreincluded, while low levels can indicate a lack of acceptance by colleagues. If an officer isunable to maintain enough inclusion capital, they will ultimately be excluded. While everyofficer needs to acquire inclusion capital, the path to gaining and maintaining levels ofinclusion capital differs depending on the individual. For all officers, regardless of diversitystatus, ongoing effort regarding compliance with the three inclusion capital elements isrequired to maintain their levels of inclusion and, as such, inclusion amongst colleagues.Having high levels of all three inclusion capital elements therefore indicates a high levelof inclusion in the workplace. However, as demonstrated in this research, it is generallyeasier for officers who fit the norm.For example, officers from minoritised groups may be restricted in terms of increasinginclusion capital, but this does not make it impossible for them to be included. A femaleofficer working part-time with childcare requirements may not be able to increase their‘team-player’ inclusion capital because they are not perceived by the team as being availableand reliable. However, they can make up for this by being highly competent in their work(competence). This suggests that they may still have a level of inclusion in the workplace.Another example is an officer who is not as competent in their work but is part of the boys’club (cultural congruence) and works overtime whenever needed (being a team-player),so they maintain a level of inclusion through these other inclusion capital elements. As such,it is reasonable to conclude that inclusion is possible for officers from all backgrounds,although the pathway to inclusion is often more difficult to navigate for officers fromminoritised groups. This raises the issue that to enable increased levels of inclusioncapital for minoritised officers, there will be policy implications for managers in policingorganisations regarding diversity and inclusion.Organisational diversity policy in the studied organisation at the time of this researchwas generally written with a particular minoritised group in mind, meaning that eachpolicy related to one aspect of diversity but not necessarily others. When policies arewritten in this way, people from those minoritised groups have a clear mandate regardingwhat they are entitled to in a particular circumstance. For example, some officers areentitled to parental leave but not others. However, it is suggested that categorising policyin relation to particular minoritised groups may not be the best way forward for the cohortstudied here because from their perspective, implementing policy that appears to favourminoritised groups can be detrimental for these officers when trying to be included. This isnot to suggest that singular workplace policies regarding minoritised groups should notexist but that careful analysis should be given to how they are written and implemented inorder to ensure that an individual’s inclusion is not at stake when the policy is applied.For example, parental leave policies allowing officers to take time off after havingchildren and to work in a part-time capacity are detrimental to inclusion, despite beingwell-intentioned and logical because giving some officers (parents) entitlements and notothers (those without children) decreases inclusion for the officer benefitting from theentitlements, as it may reduce their ‘team-player’ inclusion capital. Under this premise,when an officer uses an entitlement outlined by policy, especially one that requires timeaway from the workplace, the officer is perceived to be looking after themselves ratherthan their team, as well as not doing their ‘fair’ share of the work. This means other officersSocieties 2022, 12, 128 16 of 19must ‘pick up the slack’ for officers perceived to be less than a team-player. This issue isexacerbated when more than one officer is away from the workplace at a time because inthese circumstances, the policing workload remains the same, but there is less personnelavailable to complete the work. This impacts a part-time officer’s ability to acquire ormaintain team-player inclusion capital and therefore decreases their levels of inclusion.In addition, policies requiring officers to report inappropriate conduct also havethe effect of decreasing an individual officer’s cultural congruence inclusion capital ifthey comply with organisational policy and report such behaviour. An example is apolicy requiring mandatory reporting of bullying or sexual harassment. When an officercomplies with mandatory reporting, they are required to challenge the status quo regardingloyalty and being a team-player, likely resulting in a loss of cultural congruence anda reduction in team-player capital. Therefore, although these policies are designed tochallenge inappropriate culture, they have the effect of a loss of inclusion capital for anofficer who complies. This is not to say that the behaviour should not be challenged or thatthe policy should not exist. Rather, it is important to understand the effects that policy mayhave on inclusion in the short term, particularly when long-term change is implementedthat assists all officers with inclusion in the workplace.Whereas diversity policies are often written to ensure that officers from minoritisedgroups can take the entitlements they need for their circumstances or to protect those whomay be subjected to bullying and harassment in the workplace, this research shows they canserve to exclude the officers who use and/or comply with them. Officers can be excludedwhen they use policies that are designed to help the organisation increase diversity andinclusion, leaving them with a choice regarding whether they use the policy and takesomething they are entitled to or not use the policy and risk being left out. To overcome thisissue, it is the responsibility of the organisation to consider all outcomes for officers whencreating and implementing policy. This requires managers making decisions to exerciseempathy, reflexivity and a sound understanding of diversity issues [79].To use inclusion capital knowledge effectively, police executives and policymakersshould adopt a systematic, holistic and critical approach to inclusion. This means thatall diversity policies should be analysed using elements of inclusion capital because allofficers, regardless of their identity, will be affected.Funding: This research received no external funding.Institutional Review Board Statement: This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelinesof the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007—Updated 2018), and WesternSydney University Human Research Ethics Committee Approval: H11100.Informed Consent Statement: Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study.Data Availability Statement: The data presented in this study are available from the author.

    "abstract": "Policing organisations are increasingly expected to be representative of the diversity (e.g., gender, sexuality, ethnicity and religion) in the communities they serve. However, inclusion of these officers in the workplace often requires them to fit into prevailing police culture, meaning that the cultural changes expected in association with increased diversity are not achieved as readily in police organisations. Drawing upon semi-structured interviews with twenty police detectives, in this article, I assert that there are three core characteristics required of police officers needed to promote inclusion and acceptance in their workplace, regardless of their diversity status. These characteristics are cultural congruence, competence and team-player ability—together known as ‘inclusion capital’. The definitions of these three inclusion capital characteristics are shaped by the prevailing police culture and organisational policy and are subject to change. An individual officer’s understanding and ability to prove these three characteristics are reflected in how well they are included and accepted amongst their colleagues. This paper contributes to previous findings on police culture using Bourdieu’s theories of ‘capital’ in a new way to explain how and why police are included in their workplace. It also describes how these findings might be used by police managers to improve workplace inclusion for all minoritised officers",
