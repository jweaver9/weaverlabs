Vincent, Professor of Agricultural Education Lexington, Kentucky 2023    Copyright © Eric Michael Moser, 2023 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9853-1851   ABSTRACT OF THESIS An Intersectional Queer Case Study of Two Youth Organizations in a Rural Kentucky High School  Secondary schools in the United States are hostile environments for students in the queer community. Schools in rural communities often pose greater challenges for queer students with less access to affirming and accepting educators. Rural schools often offer school-based agricultural education (SBAE) and the National FFA Organization as opportunities for students. Both programs have been found as unwelcoming environments for underrepresented groups, with little known about the experiences of queer students. To address hostility toward queer youth, schools have implemented Genders and Sexualities Alliances (GSAs) as an opportunity to discuss queer topics and create safe spaces. This qualitative case study sought to share the intersectional lived experiences of students in the FFA and GSA and explain their experiences with school climate, rural communities, and the two youth organizations of interest. Findings depict a hostile school culture for queer students in the school due to a lack of administrative oversight and negative perceptions of the GSA in the school and community. Recommendations from this work include professional development for teachers, staff, administrators, and community members along with revisions to anti-bullying and dress code policies.

INTRODUCTION There exists an urgent need to create safe and affirming schools for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) students. Secondary schools have been cited as overwhelmingly hostile environments for students in the queer community (Kosciw et al., 2022). When compared to heterosexual and cisgender peers, students in the queer community required additional support to mitigate harassment based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity (Kosciw et al., 2022; see also: Kosciw et al., 2014; Walters & Hayes, 1998). Educational spaces have a unique power to influence the experiences of queer and questioning students as they teach, “what the culture has deemed as important and valuable to future generations” (Meyer, 2007, pp. 21-22). Homophobic and transphobic school cultures stem from societal views of homosexuality as “an illness, a deviance, and a sin” (p. 21) which has been perpetuated through biased psychological research, religious institutions, and political favorability toward heterosexual and cisgender individuals (Meyer, 2007). These examples position queer individuals at the margins of society to maintain dominance of heterosexual and cisgender norms (i.e., heteronormativity and cisnormativity; Meyer, 2007).  Queer people continue to fight for visibility and equity in education today. As of March 2023, 378 anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced into state legislatures, primarily targeting transgender youth (ACLU, 2023). Several statutes have already been passed banning the visibility of sexuality and gender identity in schools like the Don’t Say Gay bill in Florida (Bibi, 2022), no promo homo laws (GLSEN, 2018), and school-level anti-LGBTQ+ policies (Kull et al., 2016). Despite several barriers, many schools have taken  2 steps to address these inequalities including supportive and comprehensive anti-bullying policies, inclusion in curriculum, providing queer-specific resources, and most notably creating Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSAs; Kosciw et al., 2022). Further exploration of GSAs and inclusive policies is needed to identify the status of school climates.  Statement of Problem In educational institutions, secondary schools have been reported to be hostile and unwelcoming environments for queer students (Kosciw et al., 2022). In a biannual national survey of 22,300 secondary students, 97% reported hearing derogatory anti-LGBTQIA+ remarks in school, and 83.1% of respondents reported being victims of homophobic harassment and/or assault. Teachers and staff further perpetuate homophobic and transphobic school cultures, with few teachers intervening in response to homophobic rhetoric, victimization, harassment, and assault (Kosciw et al., 2022). These oppressive spaces are detrimental to queer and questioning students, as well as students who are perceived to be gay (Aguirre et al., 2021; Barnett et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013; Myers et al., 2020).  Heteronormative cultures are especially problematic as they “act to create and support a social hierarchy that privileges mainstream identities and behaviors over marginalized ones” (Meyer, 2007, p. 16). Heteronormativity not only affects sexual orientations but also gender identity expectations. Within this context, heteronormativity sets expectations for the way we express our gender (e.g., clothing, hairstyle, manners of speech and body language, etc.) to align with expectations of masculinity and femininity. Adults in schools teach these heteronormative gender expectations as “it is not uncommon for students to be told to act more feminine if they are a girl, or more  3 masculine if they are a boy in order to blend in and avoid harassment and discrimination at school” (Meyer, 2007, p. 18). Challenging the heteronormative culture in schools has been found to create safer and more inclusive environments for students (Steck & Perry, 2017).  Rural areas often pose greater challenges for individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009). Rural schools uphold more “traditional” (i.e., heterosexual, cisgender), conservative, and religious viewpoints and values; and queer teachers and youth suffer at the expense of a safe and inclusive environment because of it (Lee, 2019). Rural teachers have been found to hold especially negative feelings toward sexual minority youth (O’Connell et al., 2010) and feel less comfortable compared to suburban and urban teachers working with queer students (Page, 2017). Individuals who identify in the queer community share feelings of loneliness and isolation because there are typically fewer queer individuals in rural spaces (Holman & Oswald, 2016). Given the climate of rural areas, queer youth are at a greater chance to face hostility and homophobia and will therefore face greater challenges because of being out in their school (Kosciw et al., 2014). From this finding, one can assume that perhaps fewer students are coming out in school due to these conditions and circumstances. Although much is known about rural schools, little is known about how these homophobic and transphobic cultures in rural areas embed themselves into secondary school-based agricultural education (SBAE) programs. Minimal scholarship has been put forth in the agricultural education discipline regarding queer individuals, specifically queer youth (Murray et al., 2020). While the National FFA Organization (FFA) prides itself on developing leaders and “[making] a positive difference in the lives of students”  4 FFA Mission section (National FFA Organization, 2023), several studies have noted it may not be the case for all students. Most notably, studies have found barriers to the inclusion of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) students within the FFA (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Elliott & Lambert, 2018; Vincent & Austin, 2021). One of these studies also found SBAE students in Kentucky were uncomfortable with gay students enrolling in the FFA (Vincent & Austin, 2021). Therefore, it is of interest to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the FFA in addressing the needs of queer students in a rural Kentucky school.  As mentioned earlier, several schools have begun to address these unique needs of queer students to ensure safe and affirming learning environments. Some of these strategies include (a) acknowledgment and acceptance of queer identities from staff members (Beck, 2020; Gower et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013); (b) inclusion of queer identities in anti-bullying and harassment policies (Kull et al., 2016; Swanson & Gettinger, 2016; Vega et al., 2012); (c) inclusion of queer experiences, histories, and identities in the curriculum (Russell et al., 2010; Wernick et al., 2021); and (d) creating safe spaces for queer students through Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSAs; Kosciw et al., 2013; Mayberry, 2012; Mayo, 2013; Steck & Perry, 2016). Through a combination of the above strategies, schools have been able to create safer and more affirming schools for queer and questioning students (Gower et al., 2018).  Notably, GSAs have been found as safe and empowering spaces for queer and ally students (Mayberry, 2012; Mayo, 2013; Russell et al., 2009). Steck and Perry (2016) discussed the important role GSAs have in schools as they create “safe spaces for open dialogue and dissemination of information about LGBTQ+ issues [and] serve an  5 important purpose toward delegitimizing the heteronormative bias and homophobic beliefs and attitudes” (p. 369). Additionally, GSAs provide a place for queer youth to gain social support (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016) and identify staff who are accepting and affirming of queer individuals (Kosciw et al., 2013). This brief introduction emphasized educational spaces, particularly high schools in rural communities, can be hostile environments for queer students (Kosciw et al., 2014, 2022). Implementing policies and programs targeting the needs of queer youth provides agency to queer students through creating safe, accepting, and affirming environments to counteract otherwise oppressive environments (Mayberry, 2012; Mayo, 2013; Russell et al., 2009).  Two youth organizations (FFA and GSA) arose in the literature as influential to student experiences and school climate. The literature depicts the positive influence GSAs can have on queer youth and homophobic/transphobic school cultures. However, there is no literature to explain the impact of FFAs on queer youth and homophobic school cultures (Murray et al., 2020). Additionally, no scholarship exists exploring a school culture where these two organizations are present. Research is needed to explore the lived experiences of youth engaged in these two organizations to explain the complexities of rural school cultures. Significance of Study There is limited research related to the queer community, particularly queer youth, in school-based agricultural education (SBAE) scholarship (Murray et al., 2020). This work will provide a critical analysis of the cultures of rural high schools, with a strong emphasis on the two youth organizations of interest. Utilizing qualitative case  6 study methodology, this study can provide explanations of the lived experiences of students currently enrolled in these two youth organizations. Additionally, the case selected is unique given the presence of an SBAE program/FFA chapter and a GSA club. This case provides unique insight into the experiences of (a) queer students in rural high schools, (b) queer students in GSAs, (c) queer students enrolled at a school with SBAE and FFA, and (d) potential barriers to inclusion within SBAE and FFA programs. Findings from this study can provide new strategies for creating safe and affirming environments for queer students in rural schools and FFA chapters.  Purpose of Study Given SBAE programs have been found to marginalize the queer community (Vincent & Austin, 2021), whereas GSA programs can empower queer youth (Mayberry, 2022), it is of interest to research the impact of these two programs on queer students when they coexist in one school. There is also a need to “center more multidimensional accounts of LGBTQ life and critically envision a future for LGBTQ youth research in agricultural education” (Murray et al., 2020, p. 310). This qualitative case study will provide an opportunity to explain the experiences of queer students who are enrolled, or exposed to, SBAE and FFA in a rural high school. This research was guided by four research questions including:  1. How do students view the overall school culture toward the queer community? 2. Why do queer students engage with (or not engage with) the FFA? 3. How do students in the FFA perceive the queer students in the school?   7 4. How do the experiences of members of the GSA and the FFA chapter compare? Theoretical Frameworks This work will utilize two critical theories, Intersectionality and Queer Theory, to best contextualize and describe the various levels of oppression queer students in high school face. By utilizing critical theory, the researcher was able to shift thinking toward the various institutional and systemic levels of oppression present in society.  Utilizing intersectionality allowed the researcher to consider the way various systems of oppression impact multiply marginalized individuals (Crenshaw, 1991). These various systems of oppression are contextualized by structural, political, and representational societal structures that privilege dominant groups (Crenshaw, 1991). Considering the lived experiences of these queer students from an intersectional framework allowed the researcher to expand their, “analytical lens for understanding inequities and opportunities for social justice” (Chan et al., 2019, p. 63).  To support intersectionality, queer theory was also utilized to explain the unique oppression experienced by queer students. Queer theory calls into question the “stability and fundamentalist grounds of categories like masculinity, femininity, sexuality, citizenship, nation, culture, literacy, consent, legality, and so forth – categories that are quite central to the ways education organizes knowledge of bodies and bodies of knowledge” (Britzman, 1998, p. 212). Queer theory allowed the researcher to evaluate such systems and categories, questioning ways of knowing and deconstructing what is “normal” and/or “other” (Dilley, 1999; Tierney & Dilley, 1998). Dilley (1999) further describes this line of questioning prompted by queer theory stating, “it is not a question  8 of ‘who is queer,’ but ‘how is queer;’ not so much ‘why are they queer,’ but ‘why are we saying they are queer?’” (p. 459).  Liberation for oppressed individuals cannot occur without the consideration of societal systems and norms privileging certain groups over others. Through combining both intersectionality and queer theory, the researcher analyzed (1) the various realities that exist for multiply marginalized individuals (Chan et al., 2019; Crenshaw, 1991) and (2) the impacts of binary- and identity-based systems (Meyer, 2007; Tierney & Dilley, 1998). Potential Limitations  Several limitations exist due to the nature and design of the study. First, the identification and selection of the research site through convenience sampling limited the possible research sites to the connections of the researcher and their committee members. This study employed qualitative observation and focus group interview methods, each method has several potential limitations. Creswell and Creswell (2018) state the following limitations for observations: • [The] researcher may be seen as intrusive. • Private information may be observed that researcher cannot report. • Researcher may not have good attending and observing skills. • Certain participants (e.g., children) may present special problems in gaining rapport (Creswell & Creswell, 2020, p. 188). In addition, Creswell and Creswell (2018) also describe several limitations to conducting interviews: • Provides indirect information filtered through the views of interviewees. • Provides information in a designated place rather than the natural field setting. • Researcher’s presence may bias responses. • Not all people are equally articulate and perceptive (p. 188).   9 However, by utilizing both observations and interviews, the researcher hoped to supplement the limitations of observations with the information provided in interviews and vice versa. Additionally, the generalizability of the findings is limited to those internal to the case, rather than external cases and populations, as it is not generally a goal of qualitative research (Maxwell, 2013). Further limitations to the work are outlined in Chapter Three. Definitions of Key Terms Cisgender: a term used to describe an individual whose gender identity aligns with their gender assigned at birth. Cisgenderism: cultural beliefs which deny, degrade, and/or pathologize transgender/gender non-conforming identities. Cisnormativity: cultural beliefs that cisgender identities are the “norm” in society. Cliques: an exclusive group with commonalities to belong to. Code-switching: when a member of a marginalized group adjusts their behaviors (language, mannerisms, grammar, appearance, etc.) to fit the dominant culture’s norms. Deadnaming: the act of using a trans* person’s name assigned at birth instead of their chosen name. Heteronormativity: cultural beliefs that heterosexual identities are the “norm” in society. Heterosexism: cultural beliefs which deny, degrade, and/or pathologize non-heterosexual identities. Homophobia: fears based upon myths and stereotypes related to homosexuality. Queer: an umbrella term that encompasses all diverse sexual orientations and gender identities without constricting them to a label, aligning with the crux of queer theory.  10 Social Norms: when individuals practice a behavior because they believe others like them or in their community practice the behavior. Trans*: an umbrella term to represent diverse gender identities including, but not limited to, transgender, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and gender fluid. Transphobia: fears based upon myths and stereotypes related to transgender and gender non-conforming identities.    11 CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW Theoretical Frameworks From a critical paradigm, the researcher believes research “has an ethical obligation, such as helping to emancipate or liberate those who find themselves in situations that are immoral, unfair, unethical, violent, or generally ‘not nice’” (Tracy, 2020, p. 53). Therefore, two critical theories (intersectionality and queer theory) were chosen to design and guide this work. While both theories are fundamentally different in their theoretical assumptions, each provides an opportunity to bring attention to and critique the various ways marginalized people experience oppression. Intersectionality allowed for an explanation of the systemic nature of privilege and oppression while highlighting the experiences of multiply marginalized individuals (Chan et al., 2019; Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991). In addition, queer theory explained the oppression held in binary categories and systems (Britzman, 1995; Chan et al., 2019; Meyer, 2007). Together, these two theories provide a powerful explanation of the complexities of the school culture of interest.  Intersectionality Theory  Intersectionality allowed the researcher to examine the complexity of multiply marginalized individuals (Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991) and individuals who experience privilege and oppression simultaneously (Chan et al., 2019). Intersectional perspectives consider how socially constructed systems (e.g., race, gender, class, sexuality, nationality, etc.) intersect and shape individual experiences (Misra et al., 2020). Rather than considering each system in an additive model, intersectionality views these systems as always interacting (Misra et al., 2020). Nichols and Stahl (2019) provide the  12 following example of intersectional versus additive models, “[intersectionality] is not about people’s experiences being shaped, for example, by being female and Asian, but by the specificity of, for instance, Asian womanhood” (p. 2). This example of Asian womanhood depicts how race and gender are not distinct categories, rather they exist simultaneously and interact with other identity categories (Nichols & Stahl, 2019).  Intersectional perspectives are founded on the experiences of Black women who highlighted how individuals can experience multiple forms of oppression simultaneously (Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991). Specifically, Black women critiqued both anti-racist and feminist movements in the 1960s and 1970s as only focusing on the experiences of Black men and White women, respectively (Crenshaw, 1991; Combahee River Collective, 1977; Harris & Patton, 2019). Black women were unable to be fully encompassed in either movement and called for more comprehensive reform (Combahee River Collective, 1977). The Combahee River Collective (1977), a Black feminist lesbian organization, released a powerful statement drawing attention to their struggle in existing among various oppressive systems related to race, gender, sexuality, and class. They critiqued the inability of anti-racist and feminist discourses to include the unique intersections of race and gender. Specifically, they stated, “It was our experience and disillusionment within these liberation movements, as well as experience on the periphery of the white male left, that led to the need to develop a politics that was anti-racist, unlike those of White women, and anti-sexist, unlike those of Black and White men” (p. 17).   Crenshaw (1991) described how these limitations of anti-racist and feminist movements created legal challenges for Black women. Movements centered around one  13 identity can inadvertently deny the existence of multiple marginalized identities. Crenshaw (1991) further identified intersectionality has three dimensions: (1) structural influences of interlocking institutions reinforcing societal oppression, (2) conflicting political interests and realities of multiply marginalized identities, and (3) representational media produced ignoring intersectional complexities and representations. Considering the complexities of intersectionality, \"there is not just one way to do intersectional empirical research\" (Misra et al., 2020, p. 2). However, intersectionality is commonly implemented as a field of study, an analytical strategy, and a form of critical praxis (Collins, 2015). As a field of study, intersectionality allows explanations for the origins of social justice movements by examining characteristics of power structures. As an analytical strategy in this work, intersectionality allowed the researcher to study “how intersecting identities produce distinctive social experiences for specific individuals and social groups, to claims that intersectionality constitutes a feminist theory that deals with issues of identity” (p. 12). As a critical praxis, this work also critiqued social injustices shared by participants to highlight the complexity of their experiences and propose liberatory change (Collins, 2015).  Most importantly, intersectionality as a guiding framework must promote social justice holistically, critiquing the various socially constructed systems (Harris & Patton, 2019). To achieve this goal, intersectional works have focused on the concepts of oppression (i.e., the relationship between power and inequality), relationality (i.e., the interconnectedness of oppression and opportunity), complexity (i.e., the complex, interrelated nature of identities), context (i.e., considering when and where intersections  14 exist), comparison (i.e., contrasting outcomes of varying intersections), and deconstruction (i.e., questioning the use of categories). However, deconstruction is not always a goal of intersectional works (Harris & Patton, 2019). While it is not feasible to include each possible intersection or tenet, it is important to focus on the tenets and intersections “most salient” (p. 5) to the research questions (Misra et al., 2020). A more detailed description of the implementation of intersectionality is included later in this chapter. Queer Theory To best understand the origins and assumptions of queer theory, it is imperative to understand the historicity of the term queer and the reasonings behind using the term. For some, including myself, using queer has become an affirming self-identification to challenge the social constructions of sexuality and gender (Kumashiro, 2002). The word queer can often cause feelings of discomfort as it has historically been utilized as a derogatory term toward gays and lesbians (Kumashiro, 2002; Meyer, 2007). However, the very use of queer is intended to remind us: of the existence of heterosexism/homophobia, the severity of heterosexism/homophobia, and, if we have ever used the term in a harmful way (or failed to intervene in such a situation), our participation in heterosexism/homophobia. The terms homosexual and gay do not stir up such connections, since the use of the terms does not carry as many harmful intentions and effects that queer does in everyday speech (Kumashiro, 2002, p. 6).  Silencing the use of the term queer gives way to the normalizing of heterosexuality and allows individuals to disregard the implications of heterosexism and homophobia. Ignoring queer oppression situates heterosexism/cisgenderism as illegitimate compared to issues of racism, sexism, and classism (Kumashiro, 2002).   15 Therefore, the use of the term queer is operationalized in this study to represent the oppression of the queer community as legitimate and as a “challenge to traditional understandings of sexual identity by deconstructing the categories, binaries, and language that supports them” (Meyer, 2007, p. 25). Queer in this way also provides an opportunity to represent a deconstruction of binary sexual orientations and gender identities (Henderson, 2019a). When possible, queer is used in this study to depict various identities including, but not limited to lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender, queer, questioning, pansexual, two-spirit, gender non-conforming, and gender fluid people.  Queer theory is founded on the concept of non-normativity, or the idea of deconstructing what is considered the norm (Henderson, 2019a). Queer theory believes the norm is socially constructed the same as othering is socially constructed in similar critical theories (e.g., Critical Race Theory, Feminist Theory). Categories typically othered include race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and class which have all been treated as non-normative in society. Queer theory calls into question the establishment of normalcy in such identity categories (Henderson, 2019a).  Specifically, queer theorists seek to disrupt the accepted binarism (e.g., heterosexual-homosexual, male-female, cisgender-transgender) of identity and the structures which privilege certain identities over others (Tierney & Dilley, 1998). This challenge to binary identity structures is known as deconstruction. Deconstruction can be described as, “a social analysis of who, why, and what produced a text; an analysis of what is said – and unsaid – through the language, form, structure, and style of a text” (Dilley, 1999, p. 459). Disrupting the normalcy of identity offers opportunities for education researchers to ask new questions and recontextualize existing knowledge  16 (Britzman, 1995). Queer studies in educational research allow scholars to provide educators with ways to best support queer and questioning students while highlighting the ways discrimination based on binary identities harms all students (Meyer, 2007).  Although queer theory has power in disrupting binary categories, it has been criticized for its failure to challenge whiteness (Bracho & Hayes, 2020; Denton, 2019). Known as the queer of color critique, this critique addresses the need to “debunk the idea that race, class, gender, and sexuality are discrete formations” (Ferguson, 2004, p. 4), as implied by notions of queer theory. From this perspective, queer studies, “fail to fully address the intersection of race and class that underpin White supremacy in the United States” (Bracho & Hayes, 2020). Essentially, White narratives are perpetuated through studies that do not consider the intersections of race and sexuality, as studies only operationalizing queer theory often do. Methods of application of queer theory in research and education have been described as studying limits, ignorance, and reading practices (Britzman, 1995). While these three modes of application were described, there were no clear strategies for implementation as queer theory requires flexible approaches to equate the theory. Dilley (1999) worked to contextualize these three modes of application into qualitative methodologies and describes tenets of queer qualitative research as the following: • Examination of lives and experiences of those considered non-heterosexual. • Juxtaposition of those lives/experiences with lives/experiences considered “normal.” • Examination of how/why those lives and experiences are considered outside of the norm (p. 462).   17 Intersectional and Queer Framework Utilizing both queer theory and intersectionality in the same framework produces a unique and powerful explanation of phenomena related to queerness. Intersectionality identifies the various interlocking systems of oppression coexisting in society and shifts away from oppression only occurring on an individual basis (Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991). From an intersectionality perspective, the researcher identified various groups who experience oppression, including queer people. Queer theory furthers this notion of systemic oppression by challenging the very identities used to signify forms of oppression. Queer theory challenges assumptions based upon binary representations of sexuality and gender identity/expression which constrict queer expressions, identities, and beliefs to what is societally accepted or normalized.  While there is not a strong consensus on operationalizing both theories simultaneously, they can be framed as supplemental to one another. Queer theory has largely been criticized for its lack of acknowledgment of multiplicities like queer People of Color (Bracho & Hayes, 2020; Denton, 2019; Ferguson, 2004). Likewise, intersectionality can be seen by queer individuals as constricting to prescribed binary forms of identity. Utilizing the two theories allowed the researcher to not only encompass the experiences of multiply marginalized individuals but also allowed for the deconstruction of the identities used to oppress queer individuals. Considering intersections with sexuality and gender allowed the researcher to identify “the impact of heterosexism in combination with other systems of inequity (racism, sexism, classism, ableism) on the opportunities and experiences made available (or denied) to students” (Nichols & Stahl, 2019, p. 8). Intersectional and queer  18 frameworks can strengthen the potential for each theory, as intersectionality incorporates social justice initiatives into queer theory, while queer theory counters notions of heteronormativity and cisnormativity (Chan & Howard, 2020). Queer Oppression in Educational Institutions For decades, educational research has depicted the failure of primary schools, secondary schools, and post-secondary institutions in the United States to meet the unique developmental and social needs of queer youth (Kosciw et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2020; Snively et al., 2004; Walters & Hayes, 1998). While post-secondary institutions have expanded their support and resources for queer individuals (Woodford et al., 2018), there is still an urgent need to expand these resources in secondary schools (Kosciw et al., 2022). Queer youth are a unique population of students that often need additional support as they navigate realizing a diverse identity and often are required to do so in educational spaces that often deny the existence of queer identities (Kosciw et al., 2014; Walters & Hayes, 1998).  Overwhelmingly, queer students in the United States report experiencing hostile school environments, with 81.8% of LGBTQ+ students feeling unsafe at school and almost all students (97%) hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks (e.g., gay; Kosciw et al., 2022). Additionally, most students in this 2022 study reported hearing other anti-LGBTQ+ remarks including no homo (95.1%), dyke or faggot (89.9%), tranny or he/she (83.4%), and negative remarks related to gender expression (91.8%) at school.  Society has historically viewed and constructed heterosexuality as superior to homosexuality through biased psychological research, religion, and political favorability toward heterosexuality (Meyer, 2007). Queer individuals face numerous political and  19 legal discriminatory practices including (a) lack of equal access to affirming healthcare, (b) same-sex couples’ inability to adopt and/or foster children, and (c) unequal pay to heterosexual peers (Herek & McLemore, 2013; Holman & Oswald, 2016). Additionally, thirty states in the United States still allow, and often fund, conversion or restorative “therapy” of homosexual and transgender youth (Human Rights Campaign, 2023).  Educational spaces are not immune to these discriminatory policies. Several states have laws “[prohibiting] the positive portrayal of homosexuality in schools through specific education laws often referred to as ‘no promo homo’ laws because they mandate ‘no promotion of homosexuality’” (GLSEN, 2018, p. 1). Additionally, some of these no promo homo laws include stipulations that teachers can only negatively teach about homosexuality (GLSEN, 2018). Queer students also report experiencing discriminatory policies and practices in their schools (e.g., being prevented from using chosen names/pronouns, disciplined for public affection more than non-LGBTQ couples, etc.; Kosciw et al., 2022). Discriminatory policies and laws contribute to heteronormative and cisnormative cultures as schools reflect the norms of the society they exist in through teaching philosophies, pedagogy, and curriculum (Robinson & Ferfolja, 2002).  Homophobia and transphobia in schools lead queer students (and those perceived to be queer) at a higher risk of victimization and harassment (Aguirre et al., 2021; Barnett et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013; Myers et al., 2020). Students experiencing high levels of anti-LGBTQ+ harassment have been found to: (a) have lower self-esteem and sense of school belonging, (b) be nearly three times as likely to miss school, and (c) experience higher levels of discipline at school (Heck et al., 2014; Klein, 2006; Kosciw et al., 2022).  20 Heteronormativity and Heterosexism in Schools Two large influences on the homophobic school cultures in the United States identified in the literature are heteronormativity and heterosexism. Heteronormativity broadly refers to the way society views: (a) heterosexual orientations as preferred or normal sexual orientation, (b) gender identities as binary (i.e., masculine males and feminine females), and (c) marriage is only acceptable in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship (Bishop & McClellan, 2016; Forrest, 2006; Gegenfurtner & Gebhardt, 2017; Ward & Schneider, 2009). Normalizing heterosexual, cisgender identities situate sexual and/or gender minorities as immoral, abnormal, or unnatural (Gegenfurtner & Gebhardt, 2017). Heteronormative cultures are especially problematic as, “these behaviors act to create and support a social hierarchy that privileges mainstream [heterosexual, cisgender] identities and behaviors over marginalized ones” (Meyer, 2007, p. 16). Society in the United States perpetuates heteronormativity through various cultural and institutional systems (Ward & Schneider, 2009). These heteronormative beliefs permeate the culture of United States high schools and can have devastating effects on queer youth’s mental and physical health, academic outcomes, and motivation (Gegenfurtner & Gebhardt, 2017; Ward & Schneider, 2009). School administrators (e.g., principals and superintendents) heavily influence heteronormativity in schools by promoting heteronormative beliefs to better “fit in” with the school’s community (Bishop & McClellan, 2016). Participants from this study expressed personal heteronormative biases which are exclusionary to queer students in their schools (Bishop & McClellan, 2016).   21 Examples of heteronormativity in schools can be seen as it is “normal” for boys to ask girls to school dances; for girls to wear the boys’ varsity jacket; for the need to elect a king and queen at school dances; for the censorship of any student or teacher’s identity outside of the norm; for teachers to be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or gender diverse; to teach that sexual intercourse and marriage are between one man and one woman (Abbott et al., 2015; Gegenfurtner & Gebhardt, 2017; Meyer, 2007). These examples of heteronormative beliefs are taught, enforced, and reinforced in schools (Ward & Schneider, 2009). To fully liberate those in the queer community, we must be willing to question and deconstruct these heteronormative beliefs in schools.  Heterosexism is the second large influence on homophobic school cultures (Morrow & Gill, 2003) and refers to the belief that heterosexual orientations are not only normal but are superior to homosexual orientations (Collins, 2000). This notion of the superiority of heterosexual identities creates a system of domination by valuing one form of sexual expression over another (Collins, 2000). Ideological perspectives of homosexuality are rooted in binary thinking deeming non-heterosexual identities as deviant. Two categories of normalized heterosexuality emerged from pathologizing African or Black sexuality which later led to homosexuality emerging as another form of “abnormal” sexuality. However, the “forms of control for lesbians, gays, and other sexually stigmatized groups differ from those of sexualized racism. Homophobia flourishes in a context where the invisibility of the alleged deviancy is perceived to be the problem” (Collins, 2000, p. 130). Beliefs of heterosexism in schools have been reinforced by teachers (Abbott et al., 2015) with little intervention (Kosciw et al., 2022). For example, Abbott et al. (2015)  22 found that sex and relationship teachers openly dismissed lesbian, gay, and bisexual students’ needs and questions while presenting same-sex relationships as problematic. Teachers (Morrow & Gill, 2003) and students (Kosciw et al., 2022) alike experience homophobic and heterosexist behaviors regularly, with few teachers openly intervening. In most instances, students report that teachers frequently make negative remarks about gender expression (72%) and sexual orientation (58%; Kosciw et al., 2022). Heteronormativity and heterosexism alike put queer individuals at risk for victimization and harassment, simply because they fail to adhere to the “traditional expectations” (p. 18) set before them (Meyer, 2007). Both concepts of heteronormativity and heterosexism work together to create hegemony, which refers to how subtle societal messages allow groups in power to maintain their power in society (Meyer, 2007). Victimization and Harassment in Schools Numerous studies have shown schools are frequently unsafe and non-affirming environments for queer youth due to high levels of victimization and harassment (Barnett et al., 2018; Heck et al., 2014; Kosciw et al., 2013; Myers et al., 2020). Victimization, harassment, and bullying are all large concerns in schools for all youth but should have special consideration for the queer community (Myers et al., 2020). School victimization is unique to other forms of victimization as school dynamics tend to focus on peer dynamics rather than “risky” behaviors. This focus on peer dynamics and social hierarchies puts those students who do not conform to the heteronormative mold of schools at a higher risk for victimization than their heterosexual, cisgender peers as they easily stand out from the norm. As a result, transgender individuals have a greater chance to be victimized than other individuals in the queer community (Myers et al., 2020).  23 Anti-LGBTQ+ harassment should be of large concern to schools as it affects both heterosexual/cisgender and queer youth alike. Anyone who is openly, or perceived to be, a sexual or gender minority is at risk for homophobic and transphobic harassment (Klein, 2006). Many people make assumptions about others' sexual orientation and/or gender identity, thus any student who does not fit the prescribed roles of heteronormativity or cisnormativity is at risk of anti-LGBTQ+ harassment (Klein, 2006).   Queer youth are exponentially more likely to experience stress, anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations than heterosexual and cisgender peers because of anti-LGBTQ+ harassment (Barnett et al., 2018; Heck et al., 2014; Klein, 2006, Kosciw et al., 2022). These negative outcomes of homophobic bullying are closely linked to declined overall physical and mental health, well-being, grade point averages (GPAs), sense of belonging in schools, and increased missed school days (Heck et al., 2014; Robinson & Espelage, 2011). Rural areas pose greater challenges for queer youth, as victimization is substantially larger for rural youth than urban and suburban youth (Kosciw et al., 2014). As a result, the path to depression and missed days of school was larger for rural students (Kosciw et al., 2014). Additionally, victimization and harassment have been linked to instances of extreme violence (Klein, 2006) and increased suicidal ideation (Barnett et al., 2018). Klein (2006) found clear evidence to support bullying based on known and/or perceived sexual identity had a clear connection to catalyzing extreme violence in schools, including school shootings. Cultures, where this kind of harassment and bullying are the norm, cause detrimental impacts on students' physical and emotional well-being and are often compounded by a lack of adult intervention (Klein, 2006). There is also a strong  24 association between anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and suicide attempts, with some queer youth reporting being as much as 2.5 times more likely to attempt suicide in the past year than heterosexual and cisgender youth (Barnett et al., 2018).  Gender Norms and Masculinity in Schools As stated previously, heteronormativity not only affects sexual orientations but also gender identity expectations. Within this context, heteronormativity sets expectations for the way we express our gender (e.g., clothing, hairstyle, manners of speech and body language, etc.) to align with expectations of masculinity and femininity (Meyer, 2007). Adults in schools teach these heteronormative gender expectations, as Meyer (2007) explains, “It is not uncommon for students to be told to act more feminine if they are a girl, or more masculine if they are a boy in order to blend in and avoid harassment and discrimination at school” (p. 18). Forrest (2006) supports this connection, as they explain how heteronormativity “[implies] that boys who show their feelings or who are too intimate with other boys are either ‘girls’ or ‘poofs’” (p. 119). Girls are also at risk for victimization due to heteronormativity as females who express more masculine traits can potentially be perceived as dykes or lesbians (Forrest, 2006, p. 119). Societal views of “traditional” masculinity are specifically a large catalyst in creating homophobic school cultures (Klein, 2006). In this context, societal views create a space to use the term gay as a threat to those who do not conform and either identify or are perceived to have a minority sexual orientation or gender identity (Klein, 2006). In rural areas, views of masculinity are typically more rigid and narrower, “where there is less acceptance of diversity and less tolerance of someone who is different” (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009, p. 154).   25 These gendered patterns of power in society embed themselves in school cultures in the United States which privileges hyper-masculinity (Klein, 2006), otherwise known as toxic masculinity (Elliott, 2018). Hyper-masculinity is when men who are insecure in their gender identity feel the need to overcompensate with aggression and violent behavior to “heal a damaged sense of manhood” (as cited in Klein, 2006, p. 44). Masculinity is taught through schools and society for boys to be athletic, strong, misogynistic, and non-emotional (Meyer, 2007). Students who were bullied based upon “not being masculine enough” for the “jocks” and “preps” in school were more likely to act out with violence to assert their masculinity and dominance over others (Klein, 2006). Elliott (2018) believes schools can challenge these notions of hyper-masculinity by teaching complex masculine identities and intervening against sexist language, behaviors, and violence.  Cultures driven by binary gender identities and expression can further marginalize students who identify as trans*, non-binary, and/or gender non-conforming (McBride, 2020). In addition to privileging masculine identities, school cultures privilege identities that conform to cisnormative ideals and binary gender identities. However, schools that have combatted binary gender norms and affirmed trans* youth (e.g., properly using pronouns and chosen names) have been shown to improve the experiences of transgender and non-binary students (McBride, 2020). Community Influence on School Culture School cultures are also directly reflected by the communities in which they reside (Meyer, 2008). Teachers have explicitly shared, “the values and expectations of the community were significant factors that shaped what could and could not happen in  26 their school” (Meyer, 2008, p. 565). Especially in rural areas, schools are typically the centers of all community events and activities and provide a shared sense of tradition for rural youth and adults (Sorgen & Rogers, 2021). Rural schools uphold more traditional, conservative, and religious viewpoints and values; and queer teachers and youth suffer the expense of a safe and inclusive environment because of it (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009; Lee, 2019). Also, feelings of loneliness and isolation often arise for queer individuals given there are fewer openly queer people than in urban areas (Holman & Oswald, 2016).  Teachers and administrators in rural areas have been found to have a large influence on the homophobia experienced in schools (Bishop & McClellan, 2016; O’Connell et al., 2010). O’Connell et al. (2016) found in their study that rural school staff, especially teachers, held especially negative feelings toward sexual minorities. Rural teachers have also been found to not only be less comfortable with the queer community (Page, 2017), but less knowledgeable about the community in general (O’Connell et al., 2016). Additionally, rural administrators, counselors, and other school staff were similarly found to hold less favorable views of sexual minorities than other minorities (Bishop & McClellan, 2016). Rural principals specifically have been found to hold negative views of sexual minorities. Principals in rural areas are largely intertwined with the community and its values, compromising their ability to advocate for sexual and gender minority students (Bishop & McClellan, 2016). These findings about school staff perceptions are concerning as “teacher-student relationships may be one of the few  27 variables that protect LGBTQ students from unwelcoming and/or hostile school environments” (O’Connell et al., 2016, p. 304).  Lesbian, gay, and bisexual teachers in rural areas also face external challenges due to the nature of rural communities (Lee, 2019). In rural areas, parents of students feel more connected to teachers as they are more likely to know the teacher outside of school (Lee, 2019), given the closeness of rural communities (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009). Rural LGB teachers, “often lack opportunity to speak their identity into existence at school, and the need to manage the intersection of sexual and teacher selves leads to personal dissonance, low self-worth and in many cases, depression, and anxiety” (Lee, 2019, p. 12).  Rural queer youth are also more likely to face school cultures that are more hostile and homophobic, in schools that provide fewer supportive resources (Kosciw et al., 2014). Additionally, rural queer youth seem to face greater consequences because of being out in their schools because of these factors, given the lack of anonymity in rural communities (Kosciw et al., 2014). Queer students in rural schools are significantly disadvantaged, attending schools valuing heteronormative and conservative ideals and teaching how queer identities are wrong, deviant, and invalid (Gegenfurtner & Gebhardt, 2017). From these findings, it is likely fewer students are comfortable coming out in rural schools when compared to urban and suburban schools. Resources, as described later in this chapter, should be expanded in rural schools to support the experiences of queer and questioning students.  28 Agricultural Education and the National FFA Organization Although much is known about queer experiences in rural settings and schools, little is known about how these heteronormative and cisnormative cultures embed themselves into school-based agricultural education (SBAE) programs (Murray et al., 2020). A vast deficit of knowledge exists around queer experiences in SBAE scholarship, given “only one single empirical study was published in the primary journals of the field that even bares passing acknowledgment to the LGBTQ community” (p. 310). This deficit of knowledge leaves the profession with little knowledge of queer youth’s experiences in SBAE and best practices for SBAE teachers to create safe and affirming environments (Murray et al., 2020). The lack of representation of queer identities in SBAE scholarship aligns with previous studies which identified barriers to the inclusion of marginalized communities in agricultural education and the National FFA Organization (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Elliott & Lambert, 2018; Vincent & Austin, 2021). The FFA, a component of SBAE programming (Croom, 2008), has been criticized for privileging White, cisgender male, and heterosexual identities (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Vincent & Austin, 2021).  One of the few studies that included, but not focused, on queer youth found concerning views of students in SBAE programs. High school seniors enrolled in SBAE programs in Kentucky reported being exclusionary to gay students in their schools (Vincent & Austin, 2021). Within their study, high school senior students in agricultural education were questioned on their likeness to mock student profiles of three dyadic characteristics: race, sexuality, and social. Profiles who were not from a farm, White, or  29 straight were assumed to be unlike most students in secondary agricultural education programs. From this, one can assume SBAE programs reflect the homophobic and heteronormative cultures of rural schools in general. The criticisms of the FFA suggest a connection between the findings of SBAE programs in Kentucky (Vincent & Austin, 2021) and the culture of FFA chapters.  Schoolwide Supports Although there are largely negative aspects to school for queer youth, there are various ways schools have created supportive and liberated environments for students through (a) visibly supportive staff (Beck, 2020; Gower et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013), (b) anti-bullying and harassment policies specific to sexual orientation and gender identities (Kull et al., 2016; Swanson & Gettinger, 2016; Vega et al., 2012), (c) queer inclusive curriculum (Russell et al., 2010; Wernick et al., 2021), and (d) school programs like Gender and Sexuality Alliances (GSAs; Kosciw et al., 2013; Steck & Perry, 2016). Gower et al. (2018) found “schools using more supportive practices experienced significantly lower odds of relational bullying, victimization, physical bullying perpetration, and sexual orientation-based bullying victimization than those schools using fewer practices” (p. 819). This section will unpack the various schoolwide supports that can be provided for queer youth and the challenges to implementing each. Influence of School Teachers and Administrators Teachers and administrators supportive of sexual and gender minority students are crucial to cultivating safe and inclusive spaces for queer youth given their large influence on school culture (Beck, 2020; Gower et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013). This can be challenging to do, as teachers themselves may hold personal biases toward the queer  30 community (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016). In their study, Swanson and Gettinger (2016) reported 63% of teachers in their study acknowledged personal values and discomforts toward the queer community prevented them from intervening in homophobic behaviors and harassment. Page (2017) expands on this finding, noting teachers in rural areas and who are religious are more likely to be less comfortable addressing queer issues.  School administrators typically impact broader influences of school culture (e.g., policies for students and staff), while teachers impact more day-to-day parts of school culture while working with students (Beck, 2020; Meyer, 2008). Administrative policies directly impact (a) what teachers are (or are not) allowed to address, and (b) what students are (or are not) allowed to do in school (Meyer, 2008; Payne & Smith, 2011). These restraints from administrators create challenges for teachers to intervene in queer harassment, as teachers want to feel the school administration will support their decision (Meyer, 2008). Teachers in Payne and Smith’s (2011) study supported this finding, stating, “being ‘supportive and open’ to LGBTQ students ‘has to be endorsed by our top administrators’ in order for the message to be disseminated throughout the school community” (p. 196). Administrative barriers to queer visibility in schools may also explain why teachers mostly recognize the importance of displaying visual support for queer students (e.g., pride flags and safe space stickers), but very few do (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016).  Although there are challenges, there is an array of benefits to providing queer youth with a safe environment. Nationally, students who can identify 11 or more staff who are visibly supportive of the queer community are more likely to feel safe at school, felt increased belonging, and had higher academic achievements than students who have  31 less than five supportive teachers/staff (Kosciw et al., 2022). Additionally, students with more visibly supportive educators reported better psychological well-being (e.g., increased self-esteem, decreased anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations; Kosciw et al., 2022).  Queer Supportive Policies and Programming School anti-bullying and harassment policies explicitly protecting sexual orientation and gender identities are effective in providing a more positive school environment for queer youth (Kosciw et al., 2022; Kull et al., 2016). These protective policies have an impact on the broader school community’s attitudes as well, as they signal the district’s support for queer students and staff (Kull et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2010). Queer-inclusive anti-bullying policies provide a framework for teachers to follow and hold teachers accountable for intervening in anti-LGBTQIA+ victimization and harassment (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016; Vega et al., 2012).  Teachers who work in schools with antibullying policies specific to sexual orientation and gender identity are positively associated with teachers’ frequency of taking on supportive roles for queer youth (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016). Anti-bullying policies specifying sexual orientation and gender identity have also been found to increase queer students’ overall well-being and academic performance, given a decrease in anti-LGBTQIA+ harassment (Day et al., 2018; Kull et al., 2016). Additionally, Day et al. (2018) found regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, youth in their study were less likely to be truant in schools with inclusive anti-bullying policies.   32 Visibility of Queer Staff and Students Research has found students and staff who are open or “out” to others in the school about a queer identity can have a large influence on the school culture (Beck, 2020; Meyer, 2008). These students and staff create visibility of the queer community and can work to break the stigmas and stereotypes surrounding these various identities (Henderson, 2019b; Russell et al., 2010; Wernick et al., 2021). Teachers who are open with their sexuality or gender identity can serve as positive role models for queer youth and advocate for more equitable schooling (Beck, 2020; Meyer, 2008). This is heavily influential, as queer youth report they have very few role models in their personal lives and many are inaccessible to them (e.g., celebrity role models; Bird et al., 2012). Knowing queer youth often do not have access to their role models, it is imperative for teachers to not only share identities that may align with the queer community but also for heterosexual and cisgender teachers to vocally advocate for the queer community as allies (Russell et al., 2010).  The support received from queer-affirming role models has also been found to combat the negative aspects of anti-LGBTQIA+ harassment (Henderson, 2019b; Kosciw et al., 2022; Russell et al., 2010; Wernick et al., 2021). Students who had positive relationships with teachers have been found to feel safer at school, miss fewer days at school for safety concerns, and had higher grades and post-secondary aspirations (Russell et al., 2010). Teachers can also play large roles in influencing the norms and behaviors of the school and model positive ways to intervene (Wernick et al., 2021). One teacher noted the importance of affirming students’ identities as “the importance of visible LGBT  33 role models to students’ ability to imagine their own future selves as LGBT-identified ‘real people’” (Henderson, 2019b, p. 859).  Though teacher role models are imperative for queer youth, there are various barriers to teachers being visible in the school community. As cited in Meyer (2007), the idea of teacher ‘professionalism’ in the United States is an extremely powerful discourse that exists in a heteronormative light, and those who do not align with heteronormativity are accused of being ‘unprofessional.’ Duarte (2020) posits, “the prevalence of heteronormativity and queer erasure in schools leads queer teachers to be poor, or better yet problematic, role models to LGBTQ+ youth because they give them heteronormative advice, cautioning them on how they should navigate” (p. 28).  Inclusion in Curriculum Visibility of the queer community in the curriculum has been found to combat homophobia in schools, with queer students reporting feeling safer and having a clear resource for information and support about sexual orientation and gender identity questions (Bishop & Atlas, 2013; Flores, 2012; Russell et al., 2010; Wernick et al., 2021).  Much like the other schoolwide supports, there are challenges to including queer identities in the school curriculum (Flores, 2012). Bishop and Atlas (2013) found many school districts were already teaching family structures outside of the typical “nuclear” family structure (e.g., single-parent households, blended and stepfamilies, etc.), but less than a quarter of schools included LGBT families in the curriculum. And of those schools that did teach an LGBT-inclusive curriculum, almost 90% of those were taught informally to students (i.e., not in an official lesson about LGBT identities; Bishop &  34 Atlas, 2013). Currently, when queer identities are included in the curriculum, they are typically only taught in sex and relationship education courses (Abbott et al., 2015). Even when these courses “teach” these identities, the teachers will often make heterosexist comments that queer identities are deviant, promiscuous, and invalid (Abbott et al., 2015).  Although not all teachers may make heterosexist comments about queer identities, many teachers report that they lack the knowledge about how to include these identities in their curriculum (Abbott et al., 2015; Flores, 2012; Page, 2017). Aside from personal biases, another challenge teachers report to including queer identities in the curriculum is fear of parent and/or administrative repercussions (Page, 2017).  Curricular inclusion of queer identities is essential to creating inclusive spaces as “the curriculum reflects who and what are valued in schools” (Page, 2017, p. 13). Queer youth with inclusive curriculum report hearing fewer anti-LGBTQ+ remarks and feeling safer overall in schools (Kosciw et al., 2022). Teachers and administrators alike must be willing to transform their curricula, policies, and programs in schools to truly provide equitable education for all students. Teacher Training One of the largest reasons homophobic cultures run rampant in schools is the lack of training provided to pre-service and in-service teachers (Vega et al., 2012). Teachers are cited as not being comfortable addressing queer issues, especially teachers in rural areas, and often overlook addressing derogatory remarks as a result (O’Connell et al., 2016; Page, 2017; Sorgen & Rogers, 2021). Additionally, teacher preparation programs  35 are insufficient in addressing queer topics in post-secondary education courses (Meyer, 2008; Page, 2017; Robinson & Ferfolja, 2002).  Teacher preparation programs lack queer identities in their curriculum, which leaves pre-service teachers at a disadvantage in teaching this population of students (Meyer, 2008). Although institutions are beginning to require multicultural classes for pre-service teachers to prepare them to work with diverse populations, very few include the queer community (Meyer, 2008). This lack of pre-service training for teachers leaves them disadvantaged when they begin their teaching career to work with this unique group of students (Meyer, 2008; Page, 2017; Robinson & Ferfolja, 2002).   Current teachers, also referred to as in-service teachers, also report a lack of training specific to the queer community (Payne & Smith, 2011; Sorgen & Rogers, 2021). This lack of professional development leaves teachers with gaps in knowledge of what and how to implement queer topics and history in their current curriculum (Page, 2017). Additionally, teachers in rural areas report having even fewer available resources to utilize in their schools to include these topics (Page, 2017). Gower et al. (2018) support these findings, stating many schools appointed a “point person” for queer issues, but many did not provide professional development for in-service teachers to combat homophobia and heteronormativity or include queer topics in the curriculum.  Additionally, this lack of training also impacts school counselors and psychologists, with many school psychologists reporting they are “unsure of appropriate actions in response to anti-gay bullying, and feel they are inadequately trained to do so” (Heck et al., 2014, p. 33). Aguirre et al. (2021) found teachers in their study did not  36 intervene when they heard homophobic discourses simply because they lacked adequate training and “do not know how to act in such situations” (p. 2445).  Teacher training has been directly connected to teachers being more proactive in addressing heterosexism in schools given adequate professional development, teacher education programs, and support from their school district (Vega et al., 2012). Swanson and Gettinger (2016) also note teacher training is essential as “professional development may contribute to an overall positive school climate, in part, because teachers themselves become more aware of the various roles they can assume to support students on a day-to-day basis” (p. 342).  The lack of training provided to teachers regarding the queer community is especially worrisome as it leaves teachers incapable of responding and intervening when anti-LGBTQ+ harassment occurs (Sorgen & Rogers, 2021). Russell et al. (2010) discuss the magnitude of this lack of intervention as “a lack of intervention by school authorities when hearing homophobic remarks in schools sends a message to students that such language is tolerated; school staff making homophobic remarks sets an example that intolerance toward LGBTQ people is acceptable” (p. 10). Genders and Sexualities Alliances Perhaps one of the most impactful supports provided to queer students is access to a Genders and Sexualities Alliance (GSA) club (Kosciw et al., 2013, 2022; Steck & Perry, 2016). GSAs are “student-run organizations that unite LGBTQ+ and allied youth to build community and organize around issues impacting them in their schools and communities” (GSA Network, 2023, para. 1).   37 The first GSA in the United States was organized in 1989 by Kevin Jennings at Concord Academy in Andover, Massachusetts (Concord Academy, 2018). The club originally formed simply because a straight student, whose mother identified as a lesbian, approached Jennings, an openly gay teacher, to fight homophobia in the school. The combination of the teacher and student led to the name “Gay-Straight Alliance.” This club came at a time when queerness was largely stigmatized in the United States during the height of the AIDS epidemic and a mere 15 years after the American Psychological Association no longer recognized homosexuality as a mental illness. Despite pushback, students and staff fought to keep the GSA at the school (Concord Academy, 2018). Two years later a nearby school in Massachusetts followed the lead of Concord Academy and became the first public high school to create a GSA (Mayo, 2015). Jennings later went on to form the Gay, Lesbian, & Straight Education Network, now known as GLSEN (Mayo, 2015); whose school climate research informed most of this study. Unfortunately, Jennings and the original GSA were not the only club to receive pushback from the school and community. Some schools have outright denied students the ability to form such groups, despite federal protections under the Equal Access Act (ACLU, 2023; Fetner & Kush, 2008). An early example which made headlines was in 1996 when “a school district in Salt Lake City, UT banned 46 noncurricular clubs in an attempt to get out of having to allow a GSA to form” (ACLU, 2023, para 3). This case was later taken to federal court where the school was ordered to reverse the decision. Shortly after, in 2003, a school in Kentucky also denied a GSA to form and banned all noncurricular clubs from meeting. However, the Bible Club and the Beta Club at the  38 school were allowed to secretly meet. The school was sued in federal court and was also ordered to reverse the decision as it violated GSA members’ speech (ACLU, 2023). Despite the efforts to restrict the formation of GSAs, schools across the United States have created such clubs to “create valuable and necessary spaces for LGBTQ+ youth and their allies to exist, dream, connect, affirm each other, and lead in safe environments without hindrances” (Truong et al., 2021, ix). While the actual number of clubs fluctuates year-to-year, over one-third of queer youth now report having access to a GSA or similar organization in their school (Kosciw et al., 2022).  As the number of GSAs has grown over the last 30 years many schools and organizations now recognize GSA as a “Genders and Sexualities Alliance” (GSA Network, 2016). This shift was made to be more inclusive of trans* individuals and reflective of the needs of youth today (GSA Network, 2016). Although the name has changed, GSAs remain focused on providing safe and affirming spaces for queer and ally students in otherwise hostile school climates (Kosciw et al., 2022; Truong et al., 2021). These types of social supports for queer youth are essential as they provide buffers for students experiencing anti-gay harassment in schools (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016).  Regardless of individual involvement with the GSA in the school, the presence of such an organization has been associated with more positive teacher attitudes toward queer students (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016) and an overall greater sense of school-belonging (Kosciw et al., 2022). Findings from the most recent school climate survey depict that students who had access to a GSA were less likely to hear homophobic and transphobic remarks in school, were more likely to report that school staff intervened in instances of anti-LGBTQIA+ related harassment, and experienced less victimization  39 (Kosciw et al., 2022). In addition to providing a safe space, GSAs allow queer and ally students to express concerns about hostile school climates with peers and supportive staff members to hopefully enact change in the school and community (Truong et al., 2021). GSAs also provide an opportunity to learn about LGBTQIA+ topics, identities, and histories (Truong et al., 2021). Through these various supports, GSAs are sites of youth empowerment, regardless of queer or ally status in the group (Mayberry, 2012; Russell et al., 2009). Given the grassroots, youth-led nature of GSAs, most focus on issues specific to their local school and community needs (GSA Network, 2023). There is no official organization of GSAs, however organizations like GSA Network work to connect GSAs across the country to “strengthen the national movement-building capacity at the intersection of LGBTQ+ youth organizing and racial and gender justice in schools” (GSA Network, 2023, liberation section).  Conclusion Homophobia in the United States education is systemic and can have extreme consequences for queer youth experiencing homophobia and transphobia in schools (Kosciw et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2020; Snively et al., 2004; Walters & Hayes, 1998). Queer students are at an exponentially greater risk for victimization and harassment in schools and must hide parts of themselves to conform to heteronormative and cisgender norms in schools (Myers et al., 2020). Although there is clear evidence homophobia is present in schools, we can improve the educational experiences of queer youth through various schoolwide supports and programs (Beck, 2020; Gower et al., 2018; Kosciw et  40 al., 2013; Kull et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2010; Steck & Perry, 2016; Swanson & Gettinger, 2016; Vega et al., 2012; Wernick et al., 2021).  Of great concern is the dearth of research focused on agricultural education (Murray et al., 2020). Students in agricultural education view students who are not from a farm, White, or straight as different from them (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Elliott & Lambert, 2018; Vincent & Austin, 2021). Additionally, students and teachers who reside in rural areas tend to have more homophobic, heteronormative tendencies than their urban and suburban counterparts (Kosciw et al., 2014; Meyer, 2008). Thus, one can assume high school agriculture programs would reflect the increased homophobia in rural areas. This study sought to explore this gap in the literature to explain the presence of homophobia in agriculture programs, the experiences of queer students and teachers in agriculture education, and strategies for combatting heterosexism/cisgenderism in these programs.    41 CHAPTER 3. METHODS  Given the interest in the lived experiences of queer individuals, qualitative methods were employed to answer the research questions. Qualitative research allowed for investigations of personal lives, relationships, groups, organizations, cultures, and mediated/virtual contexts (Tracy, 2020). Each of these foci of qualitative research explained cultural activities which could not fully be achieved through experiments or surveys. Qualitative research also allows for flexible and inductive approaches to research which do not follow a prescribed set of activities (Maxwell, 2013). The interactive approach described by Maxwell (2013) allowed for “collecting and analyzing data; developing and modifying theory; elaborating or refocusing the research questions; and identifying and addressing validity threats” (p. 2) to occur simultaneously. Researcher’s Paradigm and Positionality  To best contextualize the methods employed in the study, I must recognize the influence of my research paradigm and social positionalities. Paradigms depict the “basic beliefs” (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, p. 107) which represent my worldview and the way I make sense of reality (ontology), knowledge (epistemology), and gathering information (methodology; Tracy, 2020). My most salient paradigm is best described as critical (Tracy, 2020) or critical theory (Guba & Lincoln, 1994).  From this worldview, I believe knowledge is fundamentally tied to power and cannot be separated from the institutions which create and disseminate knowledge (Tracy, 2020). Further, my critical paradigm emphasizes the way institutions and systems have shaped the construction of knowledge historically; therefore, critical research aims to critique and transform the “social, political, cultural, economic, ethnic, and gender  42 structures that constrain and exploit humankind, by engagement in confrontation, even conflict” (Guba & Lincoln, 1994, p. 113). Through critical paradigms and research, restitution can be made over time to liberate individuals from oppressive systems. Considering the adage “with great power there must also come great responsibility” (Lee, 1962, p. 12), it is key to identify how my role is influenced by my social positionalities. As the researcher, I hold a privileged status in the research process and can potentially “rebuild participant stories in ways that conform to the dominant ideology” (p. 16) from this privileged position (Parson, 2019). Considering my positionality allowed me to analyze the power and privilege I hold in the research process. It also ensured I conducted research contributing to equity, rather than diminishing equity and the experiences of participants (Parson, 2019). One of the ways I considered my positionality throughout this study was through self-reflexivity. Therefore, a statement of self-reflexivity follows this section to identify my positionality with the structures and groups within this study. Researcher’s Role and Reflexivity As an emerging researcher, I find it uniquely important to identify my social positionalities relevant to the study. I identify as White, gay/queer, cisgender male, able-bodied, neurotypical, and educated. Each of these identities is essential to understanding my worldview and the ways I have conducted this study. There are countless examples of ways I have experienced oppression due to my sexuality. However, several identities of mine are privileged in society. For example, within the queer community, my experiences as a White gay man are vastly different from the experiences of trans* women of Color. I use these intersections of identities as an example of how I do not experience  43 intersectional oppression. I belong to an oppressive group in various systems including racism, sexism, and cisgenderism. Each of these systems is mentioned by several participants in the study, and I must share how I may misinterpret findings because of my positions in dominant groups. However, I hope in my acknowledgment of my unique identities, I can provide transparency and context toward the ways I collected and interpreted data in this study. Similarly, it is equally important for me to address my prior experiences in school and with the youth organizations of interest. As I was growing up, I was never allowed in school to learn about the feelings I was having related to my sexuality. I was never provided the school support to help navigate these feelings in a safe and affirming space. My school was not fortunate enough to have a Gender and Sexuality Alliance or related club where I could go to experience safety, support, and community. I experienced harassment in school for not fitting into a hyper-masculine and heteronormative culture, and my school did not acknowledge sexual orientation or gender identity in their anti-bullying policies which deterred me from reporting harassment.  I grew up in an extremely rural area on a small dairy farm where I was raised with certain expectations of both my gender expression and sexuality. I attended a small rural school where I enrolled in the FFA and School-Based Agricultural Education (SBAE). I came from a family that had strong ties to the FFA organization with several immediate and extended family members who were alumni. I felt lots of pressure to enroll in the organization although I had interests elsewhere. There were many times in the FFA organization when I was able to gain new experiences and learn new skills related to leadership and career exploration. However, I was never fully included because of my  44 perceived sexuality. Even as a leader in our school’s chapter, the FFA was a very oppressive space for me, and I never felt comfortable enough to share my identity with others. When I did experience harassment, it was typically from students in the agriculture program or FFA. The FFA organization is deeply rooted in traditions that stem from religious, conservative, White, heteronormative, and cisnormative cultures. I have personally witnessed how the FFA has silenced individuals in my community, and others, from sharing their identities with students at the chapter, state, and national levels. Without the support I needed in school, I never felt comfortable enough to share my identity with anyone until after high school when I was able to receive greater support in college. Even after I shared my identity with others, I still felt excluded from the collegiate versions of FFA and SBAE in our teacher education program. Through all these experiences, I find a personal drive to create a more liberated space for queer students, and all those oppressed in SBAE and FFA. To me, this liberation would include examples of queer acknowledgment and inclusion in FFA spaces and restructuring of traditions rooted in heteronormative, cisnormative, sexist, and racist ideologies. From these experiences in education, I have a unique intersection of experiences that will allow me to work with both organizations as I am familiar with the communities each organization serves. However, I may be disadvantaged because of this perspective as my experience is not the experience of every queer student in schools and SBAE/FFA. While many experiences of queer people are shared, my experience is uniquely my own. The experiences of my participants in the queer community are uniquely theirs. The stories shared from this study may resonate with others but are not the all-encompassing story of queer experiences in schools.  45 Case Study Methodology This study employed a qualitative, case study approach. Case study design provides, “an in-depth contextual analysis of one or a few instances of naturalistic phenomenon such as a person, an organization, a program, an event, a geographical location, or a decision” (Tracy, 2020, p. 61). This definition is supported by Yin (2018) who stated, “case study is an empirical method that investigates a contemporary phenomenon (the case)” (p. 15). The research questions in this study also ask how and why certain experiences have occurred in these two organizations, which are best utilized in case study methods. Case studies also allow the researcher to investigate phenomena in real-world and in-depth contexts (Yin, 2018).  Given the interest in two of the youth organizations at the school (the case), a nested (Starman, 2013) or embedded (Yin, 2018) case study was designed to investigate the sub-elements of the whole case. This specific case was chosen given the uniqueness of both organizations being in the same comprehensive high school. It was difficult to locate such a case during site selection, which would suggest an atypical, unique case worthy of study (Starman, 2013). The uniqueness of a case is supported by Stake (1995) who believes that “an unusual case helps illustrate matters we overlook in typical cases” (p. 4). Therefore, the selected site provided a unique insight into rural schools with access to agricultural education and Gender and Sexuality Alliances.  During the design of the study, and in line with the requirements for researching minors by the University of Kentucky’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), a full-board review was conducted to ensure the protection of participants. The study was identified as IRB protocol 78050. Once access to the site was given by a school administrator, and  46 IRB approval was granted (see Appendix A for the approval letter), the researcher met with club sponsors to plan dates for observations and focus group interviews. Selection of Case and Research Site  Selection of the case to be studied (i.e., research site) occurred during the summer of 2022. Before searching for a research site, the researcher and their committee set selection criteria to allow the investigation of the research questions (Stake, 1995). The two criteria were: (1) the site must be a comprehensive public high school (i.e., not a magnet school or career center), and (2) the site must have both an FFA and GSA chapter in the school. While residency in Kentucky was ideal, it was not an official parameter for the study. The characteristic of a rural area was also ideal, but not an official parameter for site selection. The site for the case study was identified through thesis committee members.  Participants: Protection, Selection, and Description  Given the nature of the study working with two vulnerable populations (youth and queer individuals), the IRB conducted a full-board review to provide ample protection to participants. Before data collection, Parental Consent/Student Assent (if under 18 years of age) or Participant Consent (if 18 years of age or older) was obtained from participants. Several measures were added to the study to ensure the protection of the participants including anonymous reporting of the findings. To provide anonymity and confidentiality, participants’ names were randomly assigned gender-neutral pseudonyms (Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Tracy, 2020). Names toward the front of the alphabet (A & B) were members of the FFA, while names toward the end of the alphabet (O-V) were  47 members of the GSA. Additionally, the name and location of the school have been redacted from the study to provide further anonymity.   The case selected met the criteria set by the researcher and committee members. The school represented the demographics of most rural high schools in Kentucky. According to the state report card, the high school selected had 1,500+ students. Among these students, 87.5% were identified as White and non-Hispanic. Additionally, 5% of students were Hispanic or Latinx, 5% were multi-racial, and 2.5% were Black, Asian American, or Indigenous. Over half of the school (51.7%) qualified for free or reduced lunch. Among Career and Technical Education programs in the school, 18% of the student population participates with 88.4% of those students identifying as White. Staff among the school represent an overwhelmingly White (98.9%) and female (80%) demographic.  The county in general qualifies among 2020 Census parameters as rural. Census data also depicts the demographics of the county which were 91.8% White and non-Hispanic, followed by 4.1% Black or African American, 4.2% Hispanic or Latinx. Indigenous, Alaskan Native, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander individuals were each below 1% for the county. Additionally, 14.8% of county residents are at or below the poverty line.   In total, four focus groups were conducted in this study. The participants were divided based on their respective organizations. There was no selection process to be in the focus group. However, students had to be members of the organization and had to provide Consent/Parental Consent and Assent. After the collection of consent and assent, 25 students were invited to the focus groups. The researcher organized each focus group  48 randomly into six to seven participants, as recommended by Tracy (2020). Unfortunately, five participants did not attend the focus group discussions due to absence (n = 1) and illness (n = 1). Three individuals who signed up to be interviewed did not share reasons for non-participation. Table 1 provides a more descriptive breakdown of each focus group in chronological order.   Table 1.  Focus Group Participants # Club Number of Participants Pseudonyms 1 FFA 6 Adrian, Alex, Andy, Ashton, Aspen, Avery 2 GSA 7 Owen, Parker, Peyton, Presley, Reagan, Reed, Reese 3 FFA 3 Bailey, Blair, Blake 4 GSA 4 Riley, Shawn, Skylar, Val  Data Collection Procedures Several methods were utilized to collect data to describe the case at the “micro (interactional), meso (organizational), and macro (societal/cultural) levels” (Tracy, 2020, p. 61). Utilizing multiple methods to collect evidence provided triangulation to the findings and content validity (Yin, 2018). The methods utilized in this study included observation of meetings of each organization, focus group interviews with members of each club, and fieldnotes. Observation methods were employed as the case study design allowed for real-world settings to be investigated (Yin, 2018). Through direct observation, the researcher observed the real-time interaction of members in each organization which provided insights into the culture of the organizations. Observational data provided complementary explanations to interviews for describing the scene (Yin, 2018). Tracy (2020) noted there may be interactions and behaviors observed in each group that participants may not  49 discuss during the interview or may not notice as a member. Observations of each group occurred throughout the month of November 2022. During each observation, I wrote raw notes depicting the scenes. After each observation, I expanded my raw notes with detailed, rich, and thick descriptions. In these thick descriptions, I wrote comments and questions on my observations. Following recommendations from Tracy (2020), I completed fieldnotes within 36 hours of each field visit. I included a summary and reflective memo in each set of fieldnotes utilizing summary sheets from Miles and Huberman (1994). I employed focus group interview methods to expand upon the findings from observations. Interviews allowed me to ask about observations and experiences I may not have observed (Tracy, 2020). Focus groups are beneficial as “they are ideal for producing insights that uniquely result from group interaction” (p. 190). Participants can also validate and extend the answers of peers to provide a more in-depth answer to interview and research questions (Tracy, 2020). Finally, focus group interviews can be a protective factor for some students to feel comfortable sharing experiences with the researcher (Gill et al., 2008).  The focus group interviews were semi-structured in nature to allow for a more discussion format and organic conversation (Kvale, 1996). Semi-structured interviews were also beneficial as “there [was] an openness to changes of sequence and forms of questions to follow up the answers given, and the stories told by the subjects” (p. 124). This format of interviewing allowed for dialogue between the interviewer and interviewee to shape the conversation and allow for emerging ideas.   50 Before conducting the focus groups, I developed an interview protocol based on the thematic dimensions of the study to orient the interviews toward the research questions (Kvale, 1996). The interview protocol included questions aligned to at least one of the research questions. Graduate students and faculty members familiar with qualitative education research and secondary teaching peer-reviewed the interview protocol to ensure the questions could be answered readily by high school aged students. The IRB-approved interview protocol can be found in Appendix B. Focus group interviews occurred during November 2022, after the observations of each organization. Focus group interviews were audio recorded to maintain the confidentiality of participants. After each interview, the researcher transcribed each interview separately. No transcription software was utilized in this study. Fieldnotes (including comments, questions, and notes) were then added to each transcription to contextualize the interviews for future reference.  Data Sources The researcher collected several data sources throughout the study in the form of fieldnotes, interview transcripts, reflective journals, and analytic memos. Providing multiple sources of evidence supports the construct validity of the findings (Yin, 2018) and provides a rich description of the phenomena (Tracy, 2020). For each group, the researcher conducted one observation and two focus groups. In total, two observations and four focus groups were conducted in this study. The researcher wrote raw notes during each observation depicting behaviors and language used by members, the content of meetings, and other notable observations about the scene. After each observation, the researcher expanded initial notes to provide a rich description of each scene with initial  51 commentary from the researcher. Additionally, the researcher kept a field journal reflecting upon each observation to critically analyze what was seen.  Immediately following each interview, the researcher recorded a reflective journal of the focus group. During these reflective journals, the researcher described key points of the discussion, behaviors, and mannerisms of the students, and initial commentary. The researcher later transcribed audio recordings of interviews. During the transcription process, the researcher included analytic memos to describe the thought processes behind the interpretation of data. While transcribing, I used [square brackets] to signify insertions and changes made to correct grammar or provide context; (parenthesis) to signify comments or questions I made; and {curly brackets} to signify actions/behaviors of the participants. Table 2 provides a chain of evidence for the data sources (Yin, 2018). This chain of evidence provides a chronological listing of data sources to organize the data analysis process (Tracy, 2020). Table 2.

Memos provide an important tool for qualitative research as they engage the researcher in “serious reflection, analysis, and self-critique, rather than just mechanically recording events and thoughts” (Maxwell, 2013, p. 20). Memos also facilitate the self-reflexive thinking required for sound qualitative research (Tracy, 2020) as they capture the analytic thinking of the researcher about data (Maxwell, 2013). The researcher wrote reflective journals for each point of data collection.  The researcher organized all potential data sources chronologically following the closure of data collection to prepare for data analysis (Tracy, 2020). The two-cycle coding (Tracy, 2020; Saldaña, 2016) process guided data analysis for the study. During the primary cycle of coding, the researcher utilized initial/open coding methods to break down data into discrete parts and make comparisons (Saldaña, 2016). Initial coding focused on the who, what, where, and when of the data that emerged (Tracy, 2020). The researcher chose to use open coding as it allowed the coding of a wide variety of data sources from this study (interviews, fieldnotes, journals; Saldaña, 2016). The researcher performed coding manually which included line-by-line coding in the fieldnotes, interview transcripts, and reflective journals (Saldaña, 2016). While coding, a codebook was kept displaying codes, definitions, and examples (Tracy, 2020; Saldaña, 2016). The codebooks from this study are attached in Appendix C and D.   Once the open coding of data sources was complete, the researcher began the process of second-cycle coding. Secondary-cycle coding seeks to “explain, theorize, and  53 [identify] patterns, rules, and cause-effect progressions” (Tracy, 2020, p. 225). Axial coding techniques (Saldaña, 2016) guided the secondary-cycle coding to progress open codes into categories and themes. Creating more conceptual categories of codes allowed themes to emerge in the findings (Tracy, 2020; Saldaña, 2016). The themes found among the data were organized by research question to best depict findings for each area of interest.  Throughout the data coding processes, analytic memos were composed to brain-dump thoughts about the participants and phenomena emerging (Saldaña, 2016). Analytic memos were used as a reflexive process to trigger thinking on the complexities and deeper meanings in the data. Additionally, these memos were used to capture thoughts about (1) the patterns and themes in the data, (2) processes among the data, (3) problems or limitations within the study, (4) future directions for the study, and (5) potential answers to research questions (Saldaña, 2016). From the two cycles of coding and thematic analysis, there were 124 pages of data analyzed, which resulted in 125 unique codes, 35 axial categories, and four unique themes. Trustworthiness  Trustworthiness is always a concern in academic social science research but is particularly important in qualitative research. In qualitative inquiry, I serve as the research instrument for data collection (Maxwell, 2013; Tracy, 2020). Therefore, it is important to consider how I may be wrong in my interpretations of the data collected (Maxwell, 2013) and provide evidence of trustworthiness in my research (Lincoln & Guba, 1986). This section will describe the various tests used to determine  54 trustworthiness within the contexts of credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability set forth by Lincoln and Guba (1986).  Credibility Three criteria were utilized to achieve the credibility of the study. First, triangulation of data was sought by implementing various methods, data sources, and times of data collection (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Maxwell, 2013; Yin, 2018). The researcher triangulated data in this study through multiple methods (observation and focus group interviews), multiple focus group interviews with each organization, and multiple visits to the site. Second, peer debriefing was achieved by discussing research questions, methods, and findings with scholars familiar with qualitative research, queer studies and the two youth organizations (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Tracy, 2020). Peer debriefing allowed an opportunity for an external critique of the study and an opportunity for the researcher to make sense of the data (Tracy, 2020). Finally, to achieve credibility, the researcher engaged in member checks with participants (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Tracy, 2020). During the interviews, the researcher asked participants to confirm or negate their answers as interpreted by the researcher. Additionally, semi-structured focus groups allowed participants to confirm or negate each other’s responses. Transferability  Considering the nature of qualitative work, it is not typically possible to generalize findings to other populations or cases (Maxwell, 2013). However, it is essential to provide thick descriptions of the context to be able to apply the knowledge gained from this study in similar contexts (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Tracy, 2020). Fieldnotes and reflective journals were used in this study to achieve thick descriptions of  55 the data. The use of fieldnotes and reflective journals is extremely important in qualitative research (Maxwell, 2013; Tracy, 2020). Fieldnotes are significant in sound qualitative research as “fieldnotes serve to consciously and coherently narrate, synthesize, and interpret practices and actions in the field, offering creative depictions of the data collected” (Tracy, 2020, p. 137). Fieldnotes provided detailed context to be provided that can be utilized even several years after a field visit. Additionally, information regarding the site itself (e.g., demographics) provides further context to the case and can identify possible transferability of the findings. Dependability and Confirmability  Finally, tests related to dependability and confirmability for establishing trustworthiness occurred. Clear audit trails provide opportunities for future researchers to repeat the work of the study and establish dependability (Lincoln & Guba, 1986). Through a clear audit trail of case study protocols, providing a chain of data evidence, and in-depth methods descriptions, the researcher gained dependability (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Yin, 2018). Additionally, confirmability has been addressed through self-reflexivity and admissions of biases relevant to the study (Tracy, 2020; Shenton, 2004).  Limitations As mentioned previously, several limitations exist for this research study. First, qualitative research does not typically generalize findings beyond the case (Maxwell, 2013). While I can analytically generalize findings through theoretical frameworks (Yin, 2018), I am unable to make broad generalizations like quantitative studies. Limitations of the researcher being the research instrument have been addressed, with validity checks identified.  56  The site selected also served as a limitation to this work. Because the site was selected through convenience, it can be assumed that the school itself values the goals of this research and is more progressive than others in similar communities. Additionally, participants in the focus group interviews likely agreed with more progressive ideologies than some who were uninterested in participation. Therefore, responses cannot fully describe the culture of the school, much less the culture of other schools. Nevertheless, the study provides a beginning point toward a much larger collection of data where inference can be made.   57 CHAPTER 4. FINDINGS This qualitative case study provided an opportunity to share the experiences of queer students who are enrolled, or exposed to, school-based agricultural education (SBAE) and FFA in a rural high school. Specifically, this study sought to answer the following questions: 1. How do students view the overall school culture toward the queer community? 2. Why do queer students engage with (or not engage with) the FFA? 3. How do students in the FFA perceive the queer students in the school?  4. How do the experiences of members of the GSA and the FFA chapter compare?  The researcher utilized observation and focus group interview methods to answer the research questions. One observation of a club meeting and two focus group interviews were conducted in each organization. Following the conclusion of data collection, all data sources were coded with initial/open coding, followed by axial coding (Saldaña, 2016; Tracy, 2020). The codes were then categorized and arranged into four themes to help answer the research questions. Findings from each theme were organized by research question in this chapter for readability.  Research Question One Findings: Lack of Administrative Oversight After hours of observations, interviews, and analysis of collected materials, it was apparent there was an overall lack of administrative oversight in the school, which led to the development of the first theme. This Lack of Administrative Oversight depicted the impacts of the lack of clarity from the administration on the school culture toward the queer community. Among both groups, students expressed behaviors of dominance, power, exhaustion, and frustration because of the lack of intervention, education, and  58 guidance from the school’s administration. Responsibility was placed on the students to navigate these systems and educate their peers, and teachers, on ways to be respectful and compassionate. These feelings from the members, in addition to observations made, were categorized into three sub-themes: (1) Oppressive Systems in the School, (2) Societal School Norms and Perceptions, and (3) Staff Influence on School Culture. Each of these sub-themes described how the lack of oversight from the administration created a hostile school culture toward queer students. Oppressive Systems in the School The first sub-theme, Oppressive Systems in the School, depicted how the lack of administrative oversight in the school created opportunities for marginalization to occur. Students in both groups expressed experiences where bullying had occurred due to their gender identity, sexuality, race, and/or religion. Findings in this sub-theme were categorized by each organization to depict how each organization contributed to or experienced oppression. FFA. Data from the FFA described a wide array of experiences from members. Some students contributed to an oppressive culture, while some students shared experiences of oppression. I first noted heteronormative and cisnormative beliefs in the school during my observation with the FFA. Students were made aware of my observation and the study prior to the date of the meeting. I heard several homophobic and transphobic comments made during the FFA meeting. I first heard such comments when two male students were teasing each other as the officers were setting up the meeting. The teasing led the students to wrestle and prompted one to yell, “This is SO  59 gay!” twice while they were wrestling. This occurred near the teacher, who did not intervene when the comment was made.  Later in the meeting, I heard two other students conversing during the meeting. While talking, these two students mocked the LGBTQ+ acronym, and community, by stating the acronym stood for “Lebron giving back to communities” and laughing about how absurd the acronym was. These two students had been on their phones the entire meeting, which likely prompted this comment. After this comment was made, the executive team of the FFA started playing Minute-to-Win-it games with the members. Officers of the FFA would call up members of the audience to play one of the games. One of the students selected prompted a response from these same two students in the audience:  The same students who were making comments about the LGBTQ+ community made comments about a student who was chosen to be on stage. These students were in the back of the auditorium near me. They seemed disengaged throughout the meeting. They talked over the leaders and face timed other students in attendance. I identified the student on the stage as potentially being a member of the queer community as they had been wearing a rainbow pride bracelet and were carrying the book Heartstopper, which is a graphic novel about a young queer couple in high school. This student was selected by the officers and seemed excited. They ran to the stage and were enthusiastic throughout the game. The students in the audience near me began making rude comments, questioning how this student was chosen and making fun of the way they dressed and acted.   I was sitting near the back of the auditorium, so the advisor likely did not hear the comments. However, these students making the comments felt comfortable enough in the space to make such comments and the students near them did not intervene when hearing homophobic comments. During my observation, I also noted values of binary gender identities in the FFA. I immediately noted this from the official dress of the FFA, which is worn during formal  60 FFA functions. There are strict standards for what is worn by female students and what is worn by male students. During the meeting, there were 12 students in FFA official dress. Female students wore black skirts with nylons or black pants, black heels, and a scarf. While male students wore black pants, black shoes, and ties. All students in official dress wore the official blue corduroy jacket of the FFA. In addition, members were expected to recite a “brotherhood pledge” during the FFA meeting, which is both cisnormative and sexist in nature, assuming all members are “brothers.”  These observations of oppressive systems were later supported in focus group discussions as members made hateful comments during the discussions and shared experiences of oppression in the school. The following conversation from the second FFA focus group displayed the heterosexist beliefs of some students in the FFA when asked to depict the inclusion of students in the gay community:  Blake: I feel like they’re just as welcomed as any straight person. I don’t really see any like harassment toward them. Not as much as it used to be. I feel like now that everyone’s more accustomed to it and knowing the people around them that there will be gay people in our community. It doesn’t really affect us as much as it used to. But it’s still there, the judgment is still there.   Blair: I feel like it’s more if the people that go out and like shout out that’s who they are and like they try to make it a big ordeal they’re the people that get more, like, people come at them more. But the people that just, like {pause} people know but they don’t go out of their way and make it a big deal. And they complain about it and say a bunch of stuff about it all the time that everybody gets along with them. Not more the people that just keep like saying it. Because it brings up attention or riles people up if that makes sense. (Like you think some people are almost too vocal?) Yes.  Bailey: Yes. There are some people that they want to shove it [their queerness] down your throat and rub it [their queerness] in your face. There’s a group of people that they’re like, yeah, I know they are [gay], and like, whatever it doesn’t bother me. But there are some people that they just like scream it. And like okay we get it. They just keep doing it for attention. And it gets to a point where like, okay we understand you don’t need to scream it at anybody. Everybody has their  61 opinions. Just move on. Some people just don’t know how to quit. I think that’s where a lot of the judgment comes from. Is when they don’t know how to quit.   When asking the students to further explain this idea of “too vocal” or “scream it”, students provided the following.  Blair: I will say like our freshman year there was a kid that brought a Trump flag to school. Which like, okay, not a big deal, whatever. And he got his flag taken. Then a gay kid brought her [pride] flag to school, and they didn’t take it because it would offend [the gay student]. Like, we get that like the kid brought it because it was USA Day or something. She brought hers just because another kid brought a flag. And then like, it was like “Well I’m gay so I can bring my flag.” I feel like some kids they really do try to shove it down your throat. And I feel like it shouldn’t be like shoved down people’s throats. Like yeah, it’s a part of life, like people are going to be gay, but there are a lot of kids at the same time that are super religious, and they don’t agree with it. They’re not going to say they don’t agree with it, they’ll just like let it go. But I feel like they shouldn’t like to try to come at the other people that just … I don’t know how to explain it or word it properly.   Blake: Yeah I want to talk about that. I feel like she has a point in some instances where they can almost go to a point where they can push the limits where they are. I feel like they know they’re not going to get in trouble because if someone approached them about them or questioned it about them then they can like turn it into harassment or something. Like “You’re harassing me because I’m gay.” You know, it’s not like that. They [vocal queer students] sometimes use it to their advantage. More than some others [less vocal queer students] would. And they do it knowing they can’t get in trouble for something like that. It’s not like going to harm you when they do it. But sometimes I do feel like they use their power of being gay to their benefit sometimes.  The previous conversations by Blake, Bailey, and Blair contribute to the oppression occurring in the school. Each of the comments made by these three students show (a) the unaccepting and hateful views held by members in the FFA and students in the school of the queer community and (b) the desire for queer students to be less vocal in their identities and subsequent expressions and actions. However, members in the first focus group did not share these beliefs. Students instead shared accepting sentiments of  62 queer individuals and experiences of oppression in the school. One student, Ashton, who self-identified as pansexual and transgender, shared this about school culture: Ugh … I’ve been called lots of names because I’m part of the gay community. Lots of names. You’ll hear things in the hallways and just … you know … the f slur [faggot]. They’ll use ‘queer’ in a horrible way too, and the slur for trans people [tranny or he/she]. You hear it everywhere. (What is the response from other students or teachers that hear that?) When teachers hear it, they usually tell them to knock it off. But usually, other students hear it, and they just laugh and giggle.   Alex and Avery supported Ashton’s story about hearing slurs and Adrian said, “That actually is pretty common.” I asked if everyone in the group had heard similar comments, even if they were not directed at them and all the participants agreed. Ashton continued discussing the school culture and shared: I just don’t get why the students can’t respect the other students. Like they don’t respect calling [trans students] their preferred name, but if you want to be called Billy instead of William, they’ll go by it, everyone will go by it. It’s just the way I see it.  Ashton also described their fear of sharing their sexuality and gender identity with others: … also, if you come out to the wrong people, you can be harmed or even killed. It’s sad, actually. Not in school, usually in school you don’t get beaten because you’re gay but if you hear the news, people get murdered for being trans. For being themselves. Why murder that person? That’s what I want to know. It’s scary to be out in the open. You know – you’re vulnerable.   In addition to the experiences of heteronormativity and cisnormativity, there was evidence the lack of administrative oversight extended to racial and religious minorities. During the FFA meeting, Christian values were depicted through planning events for a Christmas party. Additionally, all FFA members recited the Pledge of Allegiance during the meeting which references God. Alex and Avery shared about religious intolerance in  63 the school as members of the Church of Latter-Day Saints. They shared the following about hearing negative comments toward their religion:  Alex: I will just say like with the whole like gay community, I won’t just say that’s an issue because Avery and I are from Utah and our religion is a minority here. I hear things, I don’t know if she does, but I hear things –   Avery: Every day.   Alex: I hear things all the time.  I also made observations of displays of racism/racist beliefs during the FFA meeting: As the meeting is set up and the students and advisor are waiting for the club meeting to start, they are playing music over the speakers. Many students are calling requests for songs and the advisor chooses some to play. One song, Dixieland Delight excited a few students in attendance who requested it. The advisor is playing music on YouTube on the projector, and we can see the videos. I quickly notice the Confederate flag during the video and the advisor paused the video at a very inconvenient time showing a license plate of the Confederate flag.   In addition to the advisor showing depictions of the confederacy, I also noted at least three individuals wearing racist symbols (e.g., the confederate flag) during the meeting, contributing to a racist discourse in the FFA and school.  While the research question focused on the school culture toward the queer community, there was evidence the lack of administrative oversight gave way to numerous systems of oppression. The lack of guidance from administrators caused discrepancies on the issues discussed by the FFA with bringing flags to school, bullying students, hateful rhetoric being used, and racist symbols being worn.  GSA. Findings from the GSA support the existence of several systems of oppression present in the school. GSA members shared experiences of heterosexism,  64 cisgenderism, racism, and sexism in the school. Within these systems, students in the GSA also shared experiences related to tolerance and silencing of marginalized individuals.  When we began our discussion of the school culture in the first GSA focus group, members shared how students and teachers alike contributed to these oppressive systems. Parker stated, “Even in middle school, the teachers let kids get away with saying things. Not necessarily like curse words but saying like homophobic or racist things.” Presley supported this later by saying, “It’s second nature to say a racial slur or homophobic slur. It’s in their language daily so it’s hard to combat that as well.” When I asked Presley to expand on whom they were talking about, they shared it was other students.  Several students expanded upon the impacts of not only heterosexism but cisgenderism. Many students in the GSA focus groups self-identified as transgender, non-binary, or gender fluid and shared experiences where they were harassed for their gender identity and expression. These students several shared instances where staff, primarily substitute teachers, in the school would refuse to use chosen or preferred names of trans* students: Reagan: I mean, you said it last week {looks to Parker} whenever we had a sub. [The substitute] said something about my name because they saw it was in parenthesis.   Parker: Yeah, so while Reagan wasn’t here because of a band trip we had a [substitute]. On the roster, it has [our] preferred names in parentheses [next to our legal names]. So, when they said his deadname [the substitute] looked at the parenthesis and said, “[Reagan?] is that what she goes by?” And we said yes. After that, the sub said it was crazy that somebody went by that.   (But you weren’t there?) {to Reagan}  Reagan: I was not there.    65 (But you heard this?) {to Parker}  Parker: Yeah.   Owen: I have a friend that is like really, really open about themselves. Like they dress really extreme for the country [rural area] obviously. The people around here, they don’t really like them. Anytime we have a sub or something they always have an issue with [their dress] because the sub teachers are usually old. They usually give [my friend] a hard time, like a really hard time, over the parenthesis in the name. they just refuse to use it.   Parker:  Yeah and like I know for a fact that my preferred name is there, and they just ignore it. And even with not only substitutes, but I also have one teacher that always puts [my deadname] on flyers and calling roll she’ll say my full name instead of my preferred name. Also, one of my friends last year, our science teacher. He kept telling her this is my preferred name, don’t call me this time after time and also asked her to call him ‘he’ because those are his preferred pronouns. She just like refused and maybe said it like once and then stopped doing it.  (What are some of the students’ reactions when you hear staff that uses incorrect names?)   Reagan: It’s kind of like shock. Like, “Oh that’s weird, why would you say that? I didn’t know that person had any other name.” It’s really just an awkward kind of feeling.   Parker: Also, there’s a sense of like annoyance in it. Because you have to repeat yourself every single time you have a sub or every time a teacher says your deadname you have to say like “Oh it’s this.” It’s annoying that you have to do it all of the time, instead of them just like saying what you prefer to be called or looking at the roster paper that has your preferred name in parentheses. Or just simply asking you what you want to be called. I know some really, really good teachers will ask what you prefer to be called but most teachers don’t do that.   Students in the first GSA focus group also discussed students disrespecting the chosen names and pronouns of trans* students:  Reese: There’s a [student] whenever the same situation happened where the substitute said my friend’s deadname, he would just go on about “Why don’t they just use their actual name? Why do they go by this weird name?” That’s how a lot of the students here are.   Owen: Yeah, I’ve had like people in general [at school will] be like “Okay but what’s your real name?” Like, “What’s in your pants? What’s your real name?  66 You’re a girl.” They’ll be really disrespectful about it and I just have to ignore them. I haven’t had teachers in specific or substitutes not say my correct name. I didn’t have it in parenthesis I only just got that today actually. Students are usually the most disrespectful about those things. Honestly, it pains me when people like call me by my deadname and stuff. Like even though I don’t hate it, it’s really uncomfortable and I sit there like “Should I tell them? Should I not? Should I just sit here and take it or what do I do?”   Reese: This goes along with how a lot of the students think when growing up and even sometimes now, I looked very feminine. So, whenever there was a [substitute] that didn’t know me, they would use like she/her pronouns, and sometimes still now people would be like, “Oh they just called you a girl! Aren’t you bothered by that?” and I don’t care. People feel like there are very strict gender roles that you have to follow, and you have to be offended if you were called the opposite gender. It’s just how a lot of students think.  In addition to using chosen names and pronouns, students also discussed the impact of conforming to binary gender expressions. Students like Riley (GSA Focus Group Two) shared how the dress code and teacher expectations of gender identity and expression impacted trans* students. Riley shared how a teacher once told them “Men shouldn’t wear skirts” but Riley felt society shouldn’t “put a value on students based on how they dress.” Similarly, Val shared this idea as they stated, “Clothing doesn’t have gender, there are [feminine] and [masculine] type clothing, but ultimately you wear what you want. That’s how it should be.”  Students in the first GSA focus group also shared challenges with gender expression in school and compared experiences of sexuality and gender identity in the following conversation: Reagan: I feel like with sexualities it’s easier to be hush-hush about it and it’s not a visible thing. But the second you start transitioning, people will give you weird looks. They’ll say, “Why does this person look like that? What are they?”   Owen: I think it’s very easy to pretend to like the societally accepted sexuality than it is [to identify] as something that doesn’t match up to how people perceive you. transitioning is so hard in school which is why I haven’t done it yet. It’s just generally really hard to be somebody who identifies as somebody they don’t look  67 like. Specifically, in high school, people will make fun of you if you look just a little bit different or off. People are boring. Just say you’re boring.   Reese: Also, about genders. It is really hard to explain to people who have never even thought about the idea that you could be the opposite gender or something in between like gender non-conforming – you’re not a boy or a girl. It’s hard to explain how you feel that [to unaccepting people].   Parker: Yeah so, I actually identify as gender fluid. But when people ask me what my gender is I just say like “Ugh, it’s a vibe.” Like I just, exist. I’m not necessarily one gender or another, I’m just simply existing. It’s not something that I always think about.   Presley: Mine’s just my name. Oh, it’s just Presley, what do you mean? I’m just her.   Owen: Yeah, it’s a vibe. For real, like being female presenting but saying I’m a boy it’s a really weird conversation. Because they’re just like “No you’re not.” I like to dress pretty femininely or whatever but it’s just like that’s something people aren’t used to around here. Like ever.  The depictions of heterosexism and cisgenderism by students in the GSA further describe the lack of administrative oversight. There was a lack of education being provided to the students and staff in the school surrounding sexuality and gender, leaving the GSA students to bear the burden of coming out and transitioning while simultaneously educating the school on their identities. Although briefly mentioned, there were notions of racism and sexism present in the school in addition to heterosexism/cisgenderism. Racism in the school became evident during the first GSA focus group when Reagan noted there was a teacher who had “no hesitation to say a racial slur” when they read To Kill a Mockingbird. Val (GSA Focus Group Two), also discussed the presence of racism in the school: Even though like we do have LGBT, there are not a lot of minorities like me. Because I am also Mexican as well. You don’t really see a lot of people that are of Color. (In GSA or the school?) School in general. There’s just not a lot of good culture here. (So, you’re saying, as a Person of Color, that’s also something  68 you’ve struggled with at school?) Yeah. Like, the school I’ve noticed at least with my friends, some staff can be a little {groans}.  In addition to Val’s experience, Riley shared about sexist ideologies in the school. Specifically, Riley discussed with a teacher about the dress code being sexist as it disproportionately affected female and feminine presenting students.  Participants in the GSA focus groups also shared challenges with in/visibility of gender identity/expression and sexuality in the school. During the second GSA focus group, the following conversation occurred:  Val: Most [students say they are] LGBT accepting, but [they act] more like tolerating. There is some closed-mindedness – in the school – and you can be looked down on if you’re different.”   Riley: I would say it’s less like accepting, and more like ignoring. Like [the response is] “Oh you’re gay? Cool! Let’s never talk about that ever again. And I will never inquire about your personal life.”  Skylar: It’s there but they kind of just choose not to acknowledge it.   When students demanded visibility in response to tolerance and rejection, they were often met with hostility, harassment, and sometimes violence. Val shared the following experience of a same-sex couple in school: Yeah, but there is definitely some underlying hatred in this school. One of my friends, I remember, they were texting me [recently]. All they were doing was just holding hands with the same-sex person and freshman boys were throwing rocks at them.   Val had implied there was no intervention, however, while Val was speaking I remember noticing their anxiety sharing about this experience and I chose not to ask for further details. Skylar also shared about an experience where advocacy from the GSA for  69 Day of Silence was met with hostility from students. During the Day of Silence, Skylar was at practice and overheard two teammates discussing the activity: It was two people on each side that were hitting and they were saying “I don’t know why they’re being like damn silent today, that’s so stupid!” and the other girl was like “Oh, well I kind of get why they would do it, I think it’s a good thing” and she responded “well I don’t., I think it’s stupid! Don’t they already get a whole freakin month? I don’t even think they should get a day.” And she was just going on about it. It was like – I can’t remember exactly what happened but it was so blunt. I’m really glad she graduated. Me and the girls who were hitting I watched their eyes and they [got very wide] and looked at me. Then talking about like, I don’t remember exactly. I think my brain chooses to block it out. But they were talking about literal physical violence and like “Oh I should beat some of them up or kill them” I don’t even remember what it was –…  Parker supported what Val and Skylar said about how students who push for visibility are met with hostility when they stated: I know like at least us [for] three {points to Reagan & Reese}, [students] have harassed us for several years now because we are more outspoken about [our identities]. We don’t just sit there and listen to what [hateful students] have to say, we will say something about it if it’s not right.  School Social Norms and Perceptions While conducting this case study, I quickly noted the influence of social norms within the school impacting the culture toward queer youth. This sub-theme supports the lack of administrative attention found in the case study. Specifically, the administration lacked in creating a welcoming and accepting culture toward all students; built on mutual respect and acceptance of differences. This lack of oversight greatly impacted students in underrepresented groups, especially those in the queer community. After I conducted observations and focus group discussions, there were several descriptions of how the social norms in the school led to cliques and ideological divides in the school. Students shared how there were certain norms and expectations  70 (stereotypes) in the school of student groups. Additionally, students shared large divides in the school between open-minded (accepting) and closed-minded (unaccepting) students. These stereotypes and ideologies impacted students in the FFA and GSA alike and created unwelcoming spaces for queer students in the school.   FFA. During both focus groups with the FFA members, interviewees discussed the presence of stereotypes and cliques in the school. For instance, Blake and Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) each shared about how students grouped in school: Blake: Personally, I think it’s pretty diverse. We have a lot of kind of everything honestly. It’s split into like different groups. You can kind of tell where you’re at lunches or you go to the auditorium, or cafeteria you can tell where people sit. Culturally based, I guess. I’m not trying to be like, rude to call them out. But you can tell they kind of stay on their own instead of branching out as much. I still feel like as a whole, everyone gets along together and no one really goes out of their way to like judge other people. Just because of like how we are.   Blair: I would say the same. Everybody kind of has their own little groups who they hang out with. Nobody really – it’s mainly like here, because it’s such a small town, it’s who you grew up with and who you have been around your whole life. That’s who you just stay with or like your sports teams, you stick with those people.    The previous conversation depicted the presence of social norms in the school, specifically when Blake discussed being “split into different groups.” Blair also alluded to the way social norms embedded themselves into the FFA: I feel like whenever we do have our big like our FFA events and everything, everybody sticks with their groups, but at the same time, everybody branches out and tries to talk to other people. It may not be hanging out with them the whole time, but like they’ll walk, they’ll talk to them, they’ll include them.   Students in the first FFA focus group went even further and shared how the social norms developed into cliques in the school. These students believed each clique had a  71 stereotype within the school. The following conversation occurred between Adrian and Andy (FFA Focus Group One) about school cliques: Adrian: …like in the cliché high school movies, there’s like cliques or whatever and I don’t think we necessarily have them but there are some to an extent. If that makes sense. Like there are stereotypes for sure. (Tell me more about that.) Um, so, I think at any school there are going to be popular people. And I think we definitely have that. I think for each clique there is a stereotype. You know, so like, I all the time get pushed into a stereotype being in [agriculture] and FFA. [People] think that all I think about is agriculture, but in reality, I’m actually in [the government organization.]. It’s completely different. So, I just feel like there are stereotypes that come with these cliques I guess you could call them. {looks at Andy} What? Why are you smiling at me? Would you like to add to that?  Andy: Yeah, I would definitely say that I fit like the [agriculture] stereotype, but not everybody does.   This conversation was quickly followed and supported by other members during the first focus group. When I asked them to elaborate on the stereotype given to students in agriculture, Andy mentioned how “They all just kind of think that I’m lesser than. They think that I’m not as smart actually.” While students were discussing being seen as “less than” I wondered why this perception existed and the following conversation emerged when I asked, “Why do you think they put you all down like that? Why do you think that’s the perception?” Adrian: Honestly, at least from personal experience, I think they’re kind of jealous. I get the opportunity to do so many cool things and I think they’re jealous they don’t get the opportunity to do these things. I mean, we’re out of school so much doing all these cool opportunities and developing our leadership. This actually will help a lot more than most other clubs in the school and I think they’re just jealous.   Alex: “Well, I also think that it’s not just the kids in the school that view [us] that way. I think it’s just that worldwide people think that farmers and people in ag don’t really have much of an education and that’s just a stereotype. [People think] in agriculture you’re hardworking, but you don’t have an education. It’s just a view people have.”   72 The views expressed by Adrian and Alex (FFA Focus Group One) emphasized the influence of societal views in the school on certain groups and the competitive nature of the groups in the school. Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) also mentioned the influence of competition and felt many cliques were based on sports teams in the school. GSA. Conversations were also had within the GSA focus groups related to the social norms in the school. Members of the GSA expressed there was a strong political divide in the school between progressive/open-minded students and conservative/closed-minded students, creating both positive and negative aspects of school culture. Some students described positive norms in the school like the friendliness of their peers. However, most students shared about the hostility of the school culture and having to navigate unaccepting individuals through code-switching and avoidance.  Positive characteristics of the school were found in students like Riley (GSA Focus Group Two) who stated most people in the school were friendly. Shawn supported Riley’s statement by saying: Yeah, I feel like it’s surprisingly friendly. You can walk down the hallways and people will say “Hi” to you, they’ll be nice and hold doors for everyone. I feel like it’s a small-town vibe. We’re very friendly like that. Everyone kind of knows everyone, maybe doesn’t know everything about them, but it’s just nice.   In addition to friendliness, several students shared how the social norms (i.e., acceptance) of the school had improved. When I asked about school culture, Owen (GSA Focus Group One) responded: Before like COVID, it was really conservative. Like mean, the teachers were not good … Freshman year was probably one of the worst years of my life, to be honest. After COVID, after I came back [from online] it’s a lot better now. The teachers are really accepting. Even like the office workers and the counselors are really good, even though they used to not be. It used to be really bad.    73 I then asked Owen to explain why they had thought there was such an improvement in the school. They described how there were people who had moved to their town from bigger cities. Owen says these new families brought, “a lot of new ideas and a lot more like openness than what was here.” Peyton (GSA Focus Group One) also believed the culture of the school was improving after COVID. They said, “Since we’ve come back from COVID, I’ve noticed a lot more teachers with like ally stickers on their doors or desks and a lot more teachers encouraging people to come to them if they have any issues.”  While there were points of positivity from the GSA members, overwhelmingly students shared about the hostility in the school. Many students attributed the hostility to unaccepting and conservative individuals in the school. Interviewees felt they had to avoid, assimilate, and code-switch to exist in the school. Students in the second GSA Focus Group said the following: ([Riley], you mentioned something about being “Whomever you wanted at Starbucks.” Do you feel the opposite at school?)  Riley: Oh yeah. I personally identify as gender fluid. Just because it makes me more comfortable. And I can do that at work because everyone respects it. but then like here, they’ll be like “You’re a woman, what are you talking about?”  Shawn: It’s that like country [rural view] … not to like stereotype –  Riley: It’s the traditional [heteronormative/cisnormative] values.   Shawn: Because a lot of country [rural] people are like very traditional. They go by the books. I’m non-binary, and they see [me] and are like “Oh yeah, you’re a woman.” I totally agree with you.   Riley: {Imitating voice} [You’re a] woman!  Shawn: It’s like, no, back it up. Change of times. Get with 2022. It’s just that mentality.    74 Skylar: That reminds me of like, closed-mindedness. Almost. I mean I feel like not just in a sense of that but like everybody is sort of, not always closed-minded because there are some people here that I’ve talked to that we can discuss hard topics or difficult/touchy topics without them being like judging. But I feel like … I don’t know.  Riley: It’s not the majority.   Skylar: Yeah.   Shawn: A thousand percent.   Skylar: There are definitely people who are like that who I am like friends with. So, it is nice to know that there are [accepting] people there and it’s not completely [unaccepting people to where I have to go] “Oh crap, I have to put on like this mask and not be truly who I am” but that’s just around some people. I don’t know if that makes any sense it’s like certain people. (Certain people you have to approach differently?) Yeah or be careful around. (Are you referring to students, teachers, or school in general?) I mean, I just feel like some students. Like I could hear [people] say things in passing or are making aggressive comments. And now I’m like “Oh now I know not to bring up this topic around them.” But it’s never me like directly saying something to somebody and somebody being like “Oh {murmurs}” and like going off and getting mad at me.   Shawn: Yeah, I feel like you tiptoe around a lot of things [when you first meet people]. Then it’s like, oh you’re comfortable with [my gender identity], let me talk to you about this. Especially being non-binary, but presenting very feminine a lot of the time, [with some] people [I] will be like “Oh yeah, like I’m dating a guy and I can safely talk about this” but there are some people I know for sure I could never mention [my gender identity] to at the same time. Just because of what I have overheard or experiences that other people have had. So yeah.   In this conversation, Riley, Skylar, and Shawn all noted instances where they are altering their personality to fit into the dominant norms of the school to feel safe. Reese and Owen (GSA Focus Group One) also discussed having to assimilate to social norms and codeswitch in school. Reese stated, “If I’m just hanging out with friends who aren’t part of the community, I do kind of change how I act a little bit just because that’s how I’m used to acting with them.” Similarly, Owen shared how they codeswitched in school,  75 “You may not feel safe to just be yourself around everyone. You feel like you have to pretend to be somebody you’re not just to stay safe in any place you are at.”   GSA members overwhelmingly shared the poor perceptions of the GSA in the school as a negative aspect of the school culture for queer students. Shawn, Skylar, and Riley (GSA Focus Group Two) shared their apprehension about new members because of negative perceptions of the GSA: Shawn: I think coming back from COVID, people didn’t know how to be nice to everyone. They were afraid there was like a spy. Not like a spy but...    Skylar: {Interrupted} An imposter. Like they didn’t want kids who were going to make fun of it. Like people just coming as a joke.   Riley: I think it’s because a lot of people view GSA as less of a Gay-Straight Alliance and more just gay. They’re like “Well you’re not in here if you’re just an ally” because we don’t have a lot of allies in the club. We don’t really.   GSA members also shared large apprehensions of students in the school toward the GSA. For instance, Skylar (GSA Focus Group Two) shared about a petition which sought to remove the GSA: I remember stuff that was bad freshman year and stuff like that. I mean, I don’t know this is one thing that I was thinking about. GSA decorated the cafeteria freshman year or something and some kid started a [petition] or whatever that said, “Tell these kids to shut the [fuck] up. Why do they get to decorate the cafeteria?”  Riley responded and shared it was distributed online and ended up being titled “Stop GSA in School.” It was unclear what the response of the administration was. However, there were clear negative perceptions of the GSA within the school’s social norms.  76 Staff Support and Harassment Finally, the lack of administrative guidance caused discrepancies in staff members' acceptance of queer students and their ability to intervene in instances of bullying, harassment, and victimization. After my observations and discussions with the students, it was evident staff placed a large role in the school culture toward queer youth, leading to the sub-theme of Staff Support and Harassment. Students shared experiences where some staff members contributed to harassment of queer students in the school and did not accept queer students. However, students also identified several staff members who were accepting and supportive of queer students. FFA. From my observation of the FFA, there were times when the advisors may have caused harm. There were several times the advisors used gendered language like “hey guys” when addressing students. Additionally, there were instances during the meeting where I noticed a lack of teacher intervention when hateful comments were made (e.g., “This is SO gay!”).  However, during my observation and interactions with the FFA advisors, there was never an instance where an outwardly hateful comment was made toward queer students or any marginalized community. They spoke highly of their students and expressed their love for their students. Members of the FFA focus groups spoke highly of their agriculture teachers. They expressed their teachers are the best in the school in terms of relationship-building with their students and motivating students. Students felt their advisors created a family culture in the FFA, which was welcoming to students. Ashton (FFA Focus Group One), a member of the queer community, specifically felt accepted and supported by the advisors because “[our advisors] love all of us.”   77 GSA. Like findings from the FFA, observation, and interview data show the influence of staff support and staff harm. During my observation of the GSA meeting, there were examples of teacher support for their students in the GSA. This teacher utilized several social-emotional learning strategies and trauma-informed practices during the meeting. The GSA recently had a member pass away in a car accident when I observed, and the sponsor of the GSA shared an opportunity to grieve during the meeting. Additionally, the sponsor provided plenty of alternative options for students who were not prepared to engage in such an activity and provided “trigger warnings” for sensitive topics. The GSA sponsor also used gender-neutral language addressing members as “loves” or “students” during the meeting rather than gendered terms. They also made statements about how “everyone deserves quality and fair treatment in school” during the meeting.  During the focus groups, GSA members shared similar sentiments to the FFA members regarding the club sponsors. GSA members however emphasized the need for and importance of identifying trusted adults in the school. Peyton (GSA Focus Group One) shared the positive impact of their GSA sponsors and said, “One of the teachers, she’s my English teacher. Just knowing she’s part of [the GSA] made me feel a lot more comfortable in her class.” Reese (GSA Focus Group One) echoed these sentiments when they said, “Just Ms. [NAME] herself makes [it safe]. I only met her at the first GSA meeting, but I already feel comfortable with her, and I can tell her anything.” When I asked what made GSA a safe space Shawn and Skylar (GSA Focus Group Two) discussed the importance of the sponsors: Shawn: The advisors. I mean [NAME] look at them, they’re the bubbliest teacher in the English department. Then like [NAME2], I don’t know if you have seen  78 their door but they have an LGBTQ sticker to be like “Hey this is a safe space.” [NAME3] has a safe space sign. [NAME1] has got a safe space sticker on their door. It’s just comforting because they make it nice.   Skylar: Even if it was run by students, I feel like the teachers being there almost makes it better. Knowing that you have that adult perspective from a teacher. They see stuff that we don’t. Obviously, since they’re in a higher position of power. But I think it’s really nice that they’re there and they are such great people.   Shawn: The [number] of times I’ve gone to [NAME] room during their planning and just be like “I need to talk!” and talk with them about the most random things. It is a big thing in this school to have a teacher that you can go to. But having one that’s in a club that is so vulnerable is really nice. Because if I do have a problem like I’m dating a girl and I have a problem with a girlfriend and need to talk about it with a teacher and get an adult’s opinion, I can go to one of those safe ones. Or if I’m having a problem with someone who is being rude to me about like identifying as non-binary, I can go to [NAME] and they will deal with it. it’s just nice to have. For the entire club, I feel like it’s nice to have a teacher there that understands and is willing to help you. it’s just comforting.  However, there were also several experiences shared where staff in the school caused harm, harassed students, and did not intervene in instances of victimization and/or harassment. Parker (GSA Focus Group One) said: Like these [homophobic] kids, they’re loud about it. And we know that the teachers hear them but they don’t say anything about it. …  at least in middle school, I tried to email the Vice Principal about what had happened and I never got a response.  Research Question Two Findings: GSA Perceptions of the FFA One theme emerged in the findings related to research question two. This theme, GSA Perceptions of the FFA, explained the experiences of GSA members with students in the agriculture pathway and the FFA organization. Only one student in the GSA focus groups, Riley, (GSA Focus Group Two), was involved in both organizations. Additionally, few students were familiar with the agriculture pathway and the FFA organization.  79  Riley (GSA Focus Group Two) shared their experiences in the FFA. Riley was a member of the FFA in previous years but decided not to participate because of poor experiences with other students. However, they have still enrolled in the agriculture classes pathway due to the structure of courses in the school. Riley shared the following about their experience in the FFA: Riley: Last year, it was pretty bad. My class was full of seniors and people in my grade. I couldn’t even talk about like Doja Cat without [one of the students] getting mad at me.   Val: Over Doja Cat?  Riley: Yeah, I was like, “Doja Cat is so attractive” and [a student was] like “What?” and would look her up and be like “Ew … she’s not White what the heck.” It was [NAME]. He graduated. Then this year it’s mostly people from my grade so it’s less extreme. But in that sphere [the agriculture program] in general there are still issues with some people like saying the [faggot] slur, or slurs in general, or not being very nice to people who aren’t exactly like them. (Was it students you’re talking about that said that?) Yeah, like [the agriculture teacher] is amazing. Even if they did have a differing opinion, they wouldn’t say it to my face. They would keep it, write it in a stupid notebook, and burn it or something. That’s just who they are. (So, you said you’re no longer in the FFA though?) Yes. Because I’m a mega-feminist. Like a mega feminist. It’s my favorite thing to do to annoy people about how feminist I am. I’m just kidding {laughs} but I am open about it. I was in FFA, and I was wearing an abortion shirt and a bunch of boys harassed me about it. I was like “mm I don’t want to be here anymore” [So I] just stopped paying the dues for it.   In this conversation, Riley described hostility from at least one FFA member because of their same-sex attractions, identity as gender-fluid, and feminist ideologies. They also shared how slurs were commonly used in the agriculture and FFA program, supporting previous notions of harassment in the school described in research question one. While the experience was an interaction with one member, Riley alluded to other experiences with the class at large with unaccepting individuals.  80 I then asked the others in the group if they had similar experiences with the FFA. None of the remaining members in the second GSA focus group had personally participated or known enough to speak on the group. I then went back to Riley to ask their opinion on the differences between GSA and FFA: (So, how would you compare that experience to the GSA?)  Riley: Well, like, in ag it’s not … it’s more traditional. It’s all very like “Oh yeah, we’re one with the land” then GSA is more like “Oh you like ladies, that’s okay!” Like you like women? That’s fine. {side chatter} And another thing is, I’ve been in ag since freshman year, and it’s more centered around less education. It’s not like oh “we’re going to go to college after this,” it’s like “You’re going to go somewhere after this but it’s not college.” Especially the greenhouse one, that one. I’m in animal science, which is more like how to be a vet assistant with no schooling. But then GSA is neutral. You’re here and we accept you and that’s fine. Whatever you’re doing after school that’s it.  Later, Riley and Skylar (who disclosed their boyfriend was in FFA) discussed how the agriculture program was closed-off and seen as unwelcoming in the school:  Riley: It is pretty cool that we have so many out people [in the school] though. Especially with how rural we are. It’s so weird that agriculture is such a closed-off group whenever it’s like “the basis of life” but it’s so –  Skylar: Like in their own little corner.  Riley: It’s so separated out from everybody. GSA is open to everyone and people who aren’t in GSA that just are there and hanging out. Or people who did the day of silence who aren’t in GSA. But with ag, you don’t see people going to ag just because. They’re not going there because it’s not as welcoming as GSA is.  While Riley was the only GSA member in the case study who had experienced both groups, there were some members in the first focus group who discussed their perceptions of students in the agriculture program. When I asked about the FFA program the following conversation occurred:  81 Owen: I have met some of the kids that are like in the agriculture area, and they’ll be like in the farming classes and stuff. They’re usually really mean though. They’re usually like teenage boys that are kind of racist. They are usually conservative. Many come from farmer families, and they go into agriculture because they want to do that.   Reese: I do know one person. I met them through band. They don’t really talk about it much I just know they are a really sweet and nice person.   Peyton: I know a few people who did it or have done it. I think that ugh generally it is a lot of kids from farming families that go to do it. I think that’s usually the kind of person that’s drawn to the pathway. I’m not entirely sure if it’s the case anymore, or if it’s true at all, but I heard a rumor once that people that wanted to be valedictorian would sign up for the agriculture pathway. It allowed you to take dual credit classes that would get you higher on the class ranking system. I thought that there were some people who were trying to do that, but I have no idea if that’s true or not.   (I’m curious though why you all think you are so removed from that program?)  Reese: Honestly, I don’t really know the pathway half of my friends are in. It’s not something I talk about really.   Reagan: Yeah, I mean, like Owen was saying, it’s a lot of conservative boys that tend to be drawn to that pathway. It’s [like we’re] polar opposites.  Research Question Three Findings: FFA Perceptions of the Queer Community One theme emerged in the findings related to research question three. This theme, FFA Perceptions of the Queer Community, explained the experiences of the FFA members with the GSA and queer students in the school. Like findings from the GSA, very few participants were familiar with the GSA in the school. When I first asked about the GSA, Blake asked if I was talking about the governor’s scholars’ program. However, students in the FFA focus groups shared their views of the queer community in the school, which will be discussed in this theme.  During the first focus group with FFA members, Ashton spoke about their perceptions of the GSA and why they chose not to be involved:  82 I’m not in GSA, but I do know they don’t like the allies in the group. They don’t like them involved and they just make fun of them all. But I don’t get the part of that. Like it’s for them to have an alliance with you. That’s a reason why I didn’t want to get involved because I didn’t want to be involved in the stereotype that we are going to make fun of all the people that are allies with us. I don’t think it’s everyone in the group, just a certain few. But why make fun of the allies? You all are here with me.   Adrian supported this idea about barriers for allies to join saying. “I think the idea that they are negative to allies supports that there are stereotypes for everybody.” While these were the only comments made about the GSA, several comments were made about the queer community.  During the first FFA focus group, members were discussing their views on the acceptance of the queer community in FFA:  Adrian: I would just like to say that I fully support them, and I love them.   Ashton: Thank you!  Adrian: No, you are who you are, and you shouldn’t be afraid to show that. I think that a lot of people need to work on being accepting of them.   Alex: I will say that we’ve had officers [in the FFA] in the past that were gay. And they’ve been totally accepted. Somewhat.  Adrian: That is a lie.   Alex: Somewhat accepted.   Adrian: … mmm yeah, see that was kind of an issue actually.  Aspen: But they were accepted by the majority of members.   While these members were accepting of Ashton, they alluded to past experiences where the FFA was not accepting of queer individuals. They later told me how a past FFA officer came out as gay and was not fully accepted:  83 (I was just curious if there was a reason about that person or instance. Or was it just conflicting personalities?)  Adrian: Well, there was some of that too. Not supportive and things like that. (Of the person?) Yeah.   (Can you tell me more about that?)  Adrian: Oh sorry! He came out as gay.  Andy: Probably around November.  Adrian: Yeah, so this was his senior year. It was very late in the year. It was kind of obvious and so there were some people who made assumptions. While they were right, they were very rude about it, and they treated him differently. Which that bothered me.  (So, you were saying that you could tell this was happening? Like they weren’t getting along on the team?)  Aspen: Yeah, there was a little bit of tension throughout like going towards the end of the year. But this year is completely different from last year.  Andy: I will say, I don’t know how to explain this. But the person, he at the end of the year, got quite a few awards and different things. I know that a lot of people were not really supportive of him.   Adrian: Yeah, so him being successful people were jealous and making assumptions. They were putting him down for things that ––  Alex: {Interrupted} – he worked so hard for   Adrian: That he shouldn’t have been. He should have been praised because he did such an amazing job. He was such a successful person. But people just weren’t happy with him because of his sexuality. It was really upsetting.   (How do you think that changed so quickly this year? Just the fact that you all get along?)  Adrian: Yeah and the fact that we’re all accepting. They were definitely closed-minded.  Ashton expanded on this finding when they shared about other reactions to students coming out:  84 Adrian: I’m going to be honest; I think many people have different reactions. Some are not as great as they should be. But, um, I want to be honest, you know. I feel like you [Ashton] might have experienced this.  Ashton: There’s some newer freshman I heard that were like “Oh my god it’s always full of gay people in here!” and I’m like – how do you know? Like does it really matter? I’m not going to harm you. Like, I’m not going to attack you. When I touch you you’re not going to get the gay. {all laugh} It’s not a gay touch.   Adrian: I do think there are reactions that are poor. They do not handle it as well as they should.    Ashton: All their friends are giggling and everything else. I’m like, okay whatever.   Aspen: I think it’s definitely a maturity thing. It’s usually like always underclassmen that make those comments.  Ashton: But like as a freshman I never thought like that. I never thought that way.  Alex: I don’t think it’s just a maturity thing. Like, because we did talk about the whole political [mindset]. So, some people, no matter what side of the scale you’re on, some people just are just way, way, way far to one side.   Ashton: I as a freshman never thought that way because I was still out so like, I never thought that way. I love people, even though people sometimes do get on my nerves. But we’re all people here, we’re all alive.   Avery: I think it’s the way maybe people were raised.   Alex: Like tradition, yeah.  These previous findings prompted me to think about the way FFA students contributed to findings in the Oppressive Systems in the School sub-theme. Specifically, views held by students like Blair and Bailey (FFA Focus Group Two) about gay students being “too vocal” in the school. I also recalled the homophobic/transphobic comments made at the FFA meeting.  85 Research Question Four Findings: Comparisons Between the Two Youth Organizations Throughout my time spent conducting the case study, it was evident there were several comparisons to be made between the two groups. From my observations, I noted similarities between the leadership opportunities for students in each organization. Students shared common struggles during the focus groups to increase their membership, gain community support, and their desire for socialization. However, when students discussed challenges to develop their organization, their challenges arose from different issues which are described in this theme. This theme, Comparisons Between the Two Youth Organizations, is broken down into four sub-themes: (1) experiences with the community setting and members, (2) affordance and restriction of club opportunities, (3) perceptions of the club’s diversity, and (4) organizational values and membership. Experiences with the Community Setting and Members One of the most striking differences between the two organizations was the influence of the community setting and community members on the organization. Students in the focus groups discussed the influence of growing up in a small, rural community and the support (or lack of it) from parents and the community at large. In terms of the community setting, FFA members like Bailey and Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) shared their appreciation for being able to grow up with their peers and develop lasting friendships.  GSA members shared some of their sentiments toward the community setting with the FFA members. Shawn (GSA Focus Group Two) told me how “We grow up with so many of our peers too. A majority of the kids [who] go to school here [have] gone to  86 school for years together.” Riley (GSA Focus Group Two) also discussed their appreciation for knowing other individuals in the school because they grew up with them. However, the GSA members also shared how the closeness of the rural community could be detrimental to their experiences in school. Riley began this conversation by sharing how the closeness led to gossip between students, teachers, and parents: Riley: I don’t know; I think the school is very gossipy. Everyone knows everyone so if something happens to one person then everyone knows about it. No one can have any kind of privacy.   Shawn: Yeah, that is a downside of it too.   Skylar: That is true.  Riley: Especially because everyone knows everybody’s parents.  Skylar: Ohhhh that is a thing!  Riley: So, like if you do something, then they’re like “Hey” [to the parents]. It’s not a fun time.  Skylar: Parent networking. Especially whenever [one of] your parents are teachers – that’s fun {said very sarcastically}.  Shawn: Yeah, that’s terrifying.   Skylar: Just the whole, knowing people thing.   (Are you meaning that students know the parents, teachers know the parents, everything?)  Skylar: All the above.  Shawn: Yeah  Riley: Like I know Skylar’s parents because we go to church together. But like, teachers know her parents too. It’s like that type of thing. Not to put you on the spot or anything.   Skylar: No, no, no you’re fine!   Riley: I specifically, also know Skylar’s parents.   87  Skylar: Like people mention my dad or something. Just some random people that I’ve never met before. They’re like “Oh your dad is [NAME] right?” and I’m like, “Yeah… how do you know him?” They’re like “Oh I’ve known him forever, he used to teach me!” I’m like, “You’re a whole adult … what??” so it’s like, I know everybody has some sort of relationship with my dad. I bet other people experience the exact same thing.   Shawn: Yeah, like my papaw is a teacher and everyone is like “Oh you’re coach [NAME]’s kids” and I’m like “Yup… that’s me”  Val (GSA Focus Group Two) also shared how the rural community was often constraining in this way and felt “in order to feel truly you, you have to get out of here. You’re never going to be who you truly are.” Val attributed this to the closed-minded, traditional (heteronormative/cisnormative), conservative views held in the rural town.  A similar conversation was had during the first GSA focus group. Reed began the discussion when they shared how teachers and parents knew each other because of the closeness of the town: I have a bit of a different perspective. I just moved here over the summer, and I came from a place – like I’ve moved a bunch – and especially where I was at was a military area so there were always new people coming in. Nobody was close. I would say the people here are a lot [tighter] knit. Everybody kind of knows each other. I hear teachers talking about students’ parents all the time and how they know each other like, “I’ll see you for dinner!” But I do think that the parents are definitely involved in stuff. Everybody’s kind of involved.  Reed’s perceptions of teachers and parents knowing each other prompted the following conversation. In this conversation, Parker, Owen, and Reagan (GSA Focus Group Two) shared how the parents knowing the teachers wasn’t always a positive aspect of the community setting: Parker: Going on with that, I personally know people who are scared to come out or say what they believe because teachers know their parents. If they say something, then the teachers (perceivably) are going to say something to their parents.   88  Owen: On that note, what’s happening in like Florida where [teachers are] like outing kids on purpose and putting them in danger that sort of stuff could happen here and that’s really scary. [Coming out] is already a thing that is really like not talked about enough around here because it is so like country. But I think it’s going up from here.   Reagan: I would like to say that in eighth grade, I got outed to my parents. I was trying to just like tell my teachers, “Hey, I don’t like my legal name that’s on the paper, can you just call me something else?” Two of them had issues with it but the rest of them were completely fine with it. For the most part, my seventh-grade teachers were also fine with it. So, one of my teachers had called the front office, and the office called my parents. They were like, “Hey, your child wants to go by a different name. Can you maybe talk to them about it and is this okay with you?” {sarcastically} so it was a very fun conversation to have when I got home.  Parker: Yeah, um one of my friends actually they were in a class and they went by a different name than is their legal name. So, the teacher called their parents and called them their preferred name, and their parents full-on cussed the teacher out. Now my friend has to go by their legal name instead of their preferred name.   There were also alarming differences in the support received by members of the FFA and the GSA. The FFA members described their appreciation for the support received from community members. Bailey and Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) shared how local farmers and the alumni FFA chapter wanted to support the FFA program: Bailey: I feel like the community is also like [involved]. I know so many farmers this summer who called me and asked, “Are you working the fair booth?” I wasn’t but I told them one of my friends was and I said go see them. I know people who came and bought from our booth every day to come support us. If we were open, they would come. Just because like we’re farmers, they’re farmers.  Blair: Our community definitely wants to push the FFA kids. The ag industry is really big in a small town. Especially here, everybody wants to help out and do what they can for the ag kids.  This discussion continued and students in the second FFA focus group shared how the alumni chapter helped support FFA events throughout the year and told me how they purchased meals for some of their overnight trips. Students also described the long- 89 standing support of the FFA in the community as an influence to joining. Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) mentioned how they were exposed to the FFA at a very young age and how they’ve “always wanted to be in FFA.” Blair described how they “grew up around farm equipment” like Bailey and always were attracted to the FFA because of their strong community presence. Blake (FFA Focus Group Two) shared these sentiments and how their sister was “in the FFA for four years and that’s a big part of why I joined.” Blair similarly had family members encourage her to join and said, “My dad was in FFA and my grandpa was in FFA, so my whole family has been in FFA.” From the focus group discussions, it was clear there was support from parents and the community for the FFA program. Conversations from the GSA focus groups were very different when the influence of community arose. Students in the GSA shared about the lack of community support received and how parents varied in their support and acceptance. The GSA sponsor had also mentioned to me in conversation how many students were afraid to tell their parents they are members of the GSA. The GSA members expressed the lack of support from the community was mostly seen online. One specific story was striking and was brought up by both focus groups. Recently, there had been a transgender male who won homecoming king. Students shared a large amount of hatred being posted online regarding his win. Riley, Shawn, and Skylar (GSA Focus Group Two) shared the following about this experience:  Riley: Do you all like remember when we had a trans man as homecoming king?  Skylar: I remember coming home after that happened and I think my brother was on the court at that time. Like, of course, he [the brother] didn’t care if he won or not because he’s him [the trans man] but he was like “Did you see who won?” and I was saying how he was in youth group.  90  Riley: And then on Facebook everyone was like deadnaming him and then also saying “Wow a woman won homecoming king? What is the world coming to?” and I was like … this is a high school homecoming [i.e., not a big deal]  Later in the discussion, Skylar related this story back to the small-town community, and because everyone knew who the student was, they were able to use their name assigned at birth in a negative, hateful way online. Owen and Presley (GSA Focus Group One) had a similar conversation around the transgender homecoming king, with most of the backlash coming from parents on Facebook.  However, students from the FFA felt they had a strong social media presence. Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) first mentioned the positive presence the FFA had online and believed social media was something attracting students to join. Bailey (FFA Focus Group Two) supported this and said: Yeah, compared to other clubs, like HOSA, not to call them out, but all they have on their Facebook page from the last six months is their blood drive. That is the only thing you see. But if you look at our Facebook page, we have pictures from when we went to the rodeo, from when we went to the [national] convention, we have our after-school stuff. I feel like it’s just more like fun and less like ‘Ew a class.’ it’s more enjoyable.  Affordance and Restriction of Club Opportunities Another large difference I noted from the case study was the differences in opportunities for club members. FFA members shared about the numerous opportunities afforded to them to focus on personal leadership development and recreation. Adrian (FFA Focus Group One) shared how they were, “out of school so much doing all these cool opportunities and developing our leadership.” Alex (FFA Focus Group One) shared similar sentiments when they said, “I think it gives people a lot of opportunities for a lot of different things.”  91 Some of the opportunities mentioned included trips to Kentucky FFA Camp and the National FFA Convention. Alex (FFA Focus Group One) shared their appreciation for FFA camp and said, “I think FFA camp was really good because we got a lot [of experience] at camp … we brought a lot of ideas from camp back to our school.” Adrian (FFA Focus Group One) shared similar admiration for the FFA camp and shared they still had friends from the camp when they attended two years prior. However, students in the first FFA Focus Group shared mixed emotions about National FFA Convention:  Andy: I will say that camp is definitely a lot more welcoming with all the people. I didn’t really meet anybody who wasn’t friendly. But the national convention was a little bit different.   Adrian: Well, yes. Yes. I’ve gotta say, whenever we go to conventions and things like that there are those people who are –   Ashton: Stuck up or something?  Adrian: Yeah. They’re disrespectful and I don’t appreciate it.   Aspen: That’s when you’re in the big crowds and some people are just like that in big groups.   Ashton: The only thing I didn’t like about camp was I needed more sleep because of my medical thing. I feel like I didn’t get enough sleep and we just kept going and going.   Adrian: Yeah, I have to say though that’s not just FFA camp. I’ve been to so many camps and that indeed is just camp.  (Okay I want to go back to what you were saying about the convention, it seemed like you were thinking about something specific?)   Andy: So, I don’t know it’s just like at camp everyone you met was in separate groups and you just got to meet so many new people. Everyone was so nice. Then at the convention, you try to talk to somebody, and they were rude.  Adrian: I will say it makes a difference when you go to FFA camp. I think it’s just that environment. You’re with those people all the time for five days straight. I think the environment is just different. But I have an example. So, at convention,  92 we were making pillows for the homeless people and there was a place to make bookmarks afterward. I don’t know if you came over.  Alex: I did  Adrian: But you know those people that were from Nebraska? They were not very nice. Like the one girl, I told her about the contest I was competing in and she was like “That sounds awful and I would never want to do that.” Just kept saying negative things. I was actually kind of excited to be here like this is a really big opportunity for me and I was really excited about it. I was sad that she was kept being negative. Obviously, that’s just one person but I guess it happens more often than I think.  Conversely, the GSA members shared how opportunities were often restricted for the club. Students shared about lack of administrative support for some GSA-sponsored events as well as a lack of teacher support. One event was brought up related to attending a local drag queen literacy event in a public park. Students shared how there was a lack of administrative support for the event and backlash from the teachers: Presley: I’m sorry this is kind of off track but is related to after school things. I don’t remember how many years ago it was they did, well they were trying, the GSA leaders... (Teachers or students?) It was the teachers trying to get it organized. We were going down by the river story times and it was with drag queens. It was so awesome! And then it eventually got denied.   Owen: Because people were so upset about that.  Presley: Yes, people were so upset about that and even now I know teachers that are still talking about it.  (Can I ask who denied it?)  Presley: I’m pretty sure it was administrative.   (So, you wanted to bring in drag queens?)  Presley: We were going to be shuttled to a park nearby down by the river. But you have to get administration approval and they denied it. Which they said it was for safety reasons, which I can understand, but other clubs go far and wide too so why [not us]? So that was a little … aggravating.    93 (You said people are still talking about that?)  Presley: Yes, I know a teacher, and I won’t say names, but that’s how she is reminded of GSA. I go to GSA [during] her period and she is like “Oh you go to that one? Is that the one that did blah, blah, blah with the drag queens?” and I’m like “Yes” and she replied, “well that was disrespectful” and I’m like “whatever, it is what it is.”  Perceptions of the Club’s Diversity. When students were discussing their views of the school culture, I was also noticing differences in the way students viewed the diversity and acceptance of their organizations. The largest difference between the two organizations was how the FFA members discussed their appreciation of differences and focused on different interests in the group. Conversely, the GSA members discussed their acceptance of differences and focused on different identities in the group. Adrian (FFA Focus Group One) first alluded to the way FFA appreciates differences when they said, “We appreciate everybody and their qualities.” In this comment, Adrian was discussing the way FFA is used to “bring people together and gives us something to do.” Members in the second FFA focus group alluded to the appreciation of differences in the FFA when they discussed how students in the agriculture program ignored rumors and personal details about students. Blair told me the FFA tried to do this because “We try to keep everybody together and getting along where nothing is such a big deal.” The conversation continued: Blair: Nobody sits there and judges other people. We all just like we do us and everybody is themselves after school. it’s more fun because everyone is like one on one with each other.  Bailey: I feel like it’s a safe space for some people because if a girl got made fun of at lunch and she comes down here we aren’t going to be like “Oh did you hear what happened at lunch?” we’re just going to shove her into the mixture and mix  94 it all up and pretend like it didn’t happen. It’s not about what happens out there once you walk down the stairs [to the ag department] it’s completely different.   (Why do you say it’s completely different?)  Bailey:  Because we don’t care what the drama is. If there’s a rumor going around about somebody okay whatever that’s what they say. We know the person and they know a person and the people we know could be completely different people.  The students in the second focus group continued their conversation about rumors and gossip which transitioned toward their views of acceptance and inclusion: Blair: I feel like our FFA group is a lot more accepting to others than a lot of other schools.   Bailey: Yes  Blake: A lot more diverse than other schools.  (What makes you say that?)  Blair: So, we went to Indianapolis for the national FFA convention, and a lot of other schools … you can definitely tell.  Bailey: You could just see it in like what they wore when we didn’t have to be in our official dress. Just like what they wore.   Blair: The way they acted.  Bailey: It was very farm-like. They all had their boots on, they all had their bell bottoms on, and they all had their big puffer Carhartt jackets. And us, we had our girls with skinny jeans on, and vans on, and like, we weren’t all just straight what you would expect a country person to dress like.   Blair: Yeah, I feel like ours is a lot more diverse than other FFA chapters. I feel like we accept people a lot better.  (Is there anything that makes you think you have a more diverse group?)  Blair: You can tell, you can see it.   (Okay, I guess let me rephrase. What makes this a more diverse chapter?)   95 Blair: So, in our chapter, we have like the kids like us that have grown up on farms. We’re in the ag industry, have grown up on it, been in it since day one. But then we also have the kids that have never been on a farm, that’s never done anything, and we have kids that are just trying out FFA. Then they end up loving it.  When students in the GSA discussed the diversity of the club, students focused on their identities and acceptance of differences. Presley (GSA Focus Group One) told me, “[The GSA is] very diverse. Even just as a community, there are so many different people.” Owen (GSA Focus Group One) shared this sentiment and said, “There [are] so many different people with so many different experiences.” Students like Presley and Parker (GSA Focus Group One) believed this acceptance of difference led to creating a safe space to go to: (What would you all say makes it feel like a safe space?) Presley: Big, open environment, full of people.   Parker: It’s full of people who have open minds. I say this a lot, people are always going to be rude and not nice people if they do not have an open mind. I feel like most of the people in school do not have an open mind to even listen. A lot of the time, even with like adults, they’ll talk about political things and get so angry and will yell at you. like a 50-year-old will fully yell at a 13-year-old because they have different political beliefs than them.   (Like in school? or generally?)  Parker: Just generally in life. So, I feel like [the GSA is] a group with an open mind. Especially the allies since they don’t fully experience what we do.   Reagan: I feel like with GSA it’s easier to feel safe because it’s full of people who have gone through similar things and have similar experiences. It’s easy to say “Oh, yeah you know what this is like.” So, it feels a lot easier to open up about things.    96 Organizational Values and Membership. Finally, when comparing the observations and discussions from both groups, I noted several comparisons in the values and membership of each group. Each organization was found to value (1) student leadership and engagement, (2) socialization, and (3) membership. Like the previous comparisons of these two organizations, these values came from different perspectives. Student Leadership and Engagement. When I observed the two meetings, I noted both were led by student members. The FFA chapter’s officer team was on the stage of the auditorium and led a very formal, business-like meeting with little engagement of members. The FFA meeting followed parliamentary procedure and utilized an agenda to guide the meeting. The formality of the meeting did not allow opportunities to engage members sitting in the audience until after the business portion of the meeting when students played Minute-to-Win-it games. The GSA meeting I observed was also led by student officers. Each of the officers made an announcement and ran one of the stations students could go to during the meeting. Unlike the FFA, the GSA meeting was more informal and engaging. I noted the following in my fieldnotes of the GSA meeting: Overall, the meeting was very informal yet provided options for students. The options provided were very current with the needs of the school and the community. Specifically, the queer community in the school. I think the “informal-ness” of the meeting helped make the space safer as students were given agency in their meeting. Additionally, students were able to be around peers who were like them or supported them. Students were socializing throughout the meeting, and I only noticed two students who were not engaged with others. They were reading the entirety of the meeting but still chose to come.   97 Socialization. Students in both groups shared the importance of socialization within their organizations. I noted the FFA valued recreational events in the organization from my observation and discussions with students. The recreational activities shared by participants and during the meeting were very characteristic of agricultural and rural activities. For example, students discussed a “Barnyard Olympics” event where the FFA hosted several agricultural-based activities. for students in the FFA. When I observed the FFA meeting, the advisor discussed an upcoming trip for the FFA to the rodeo at the North American International Livestock Exposition. The first FFA focus group occurred the day before the trip to the rodeo, and members shared excitement for the rodeo in the focus group.  Interviewees also emphasized the recreational aspects of the FFA. Adrian told me, “We’re the only club that does just like fun activities” and was attracted to the FFA because of the recreational aspects. Students in the second FFA focus group felt the recreational activities helped members feel welcome: Blair: I feel like for the FFA, everyone tries to get along with everybody. Everyone tries to include anyone that they can. And it’s not based on who you are or what you are everybody just wants to try and get along so everyone can have high-quality F.U.N.  Blake: I feel like a good way that FFA has accomplished like combining each other and like we’re … I’m trying to think about what I’m trying to say. Like having each other like more friendly toward each other. I feel like a good way that we’re doing it is when we have FFA meetings during clubs day they do games. I feel like games when they take random people out it definitely, I feel like is way different than picking people out of like certain groups so they get to know each other a little bit better. Just doing games and small things like that.   (What other things does your FFA do, other than the meetings, that would be a fun activity?)  Blair: Like our after-school activities and stuff. We all goof off, we all get along, and we all have fun.   98  Members of the GSA also shared the importance of socialization. However, students in the GSA prioritized socialization by creating safe and authentic spaces to exist. Students like Owen (GSA Focus Group One) discussed the importance of creating a “safe space, as much as you can [have a safe space] in this kind of school.” Students also discussed the importance of a safe space for creating an accepting community where they could exist authentically. The following conversation occurred during the first GSA Focus Group around the ability of the GSA to help with negative experiences in school: Peyton: Just knowing that there are so many people in there makes you feel more comfortable knowing that you’re not alone in the school. Nobody talks about it out loud a lot of the time, or the more reserved kids won’t. So, I think just being in there and seeing how many tables get filled up in the cafeteria is a little bit of reassurance.   (Yeah, I thought that was cool too.)  Parker: You can also see a lot of different classes in there, you can find a whole bunch of people who you have classes with. And so, it can sort of be a thing you talk about and whether that person is an ally or a part of the community, I feel like it’s a good way to make friends. There are people outside of the group that are really, really nice and good. But it’s easy to find a good group of people in there. You know that they, for the most part, believe what you believe and aren’t homophobic or racist.   Reese: Whenever we have like club meetings, I just actually feel like I [don’t have to] pretend to be anybody. I can be myself and do anything I want.   Owen: I feel the same way about GSA. Like I feel like I can just let loose and let my hair down. Even though I am like pretty open, as you can tell {points to their trans flag/pronoun pin}, about like who I am it is really tough.  Reese: Also, just Ms. [NAME] herself just makes [it safe]. I only met her at the first GSA meeting but I already feel really comfortable with her and I can tell her anything.  Owen: I think people really respect each other; they learn to be civil. Even when there are so many different kinds of people in one room. We all have one thing in common, we’re all humans.  99  Similar conversations were had during the second GSA focus group which situated the GSA as a safe space through vulnerability: (So how then, for you and the rest of the group, has GSA helped you?)   Shawn: Well, it’s the reason I came out because I had the space to. When I was a freshman, I was very closeted. I did not want anyone to know. Even at the beginning of my junior year. I was like “Okay I’ll come out as unlabeled and join the club and apply to be an officer” and [teacher] was like “Congratulations, you’re vice president!” and I was surprised but was one of the only ones who fully signed up. So, navigating coming out in the middle of being an officer of a club that’s so open it was like “Oh yeah, by the way, can you all use they/them pronouns for me” and everyone was like “Oh of course!” So [I thought] like, oh this is normal? I was shocked.  Riley: Like, “Wait am I being accepted right now?”   Shawn: No, literally. And then coming into this year I got moved up to president [and got] to build an officer team that is more diverse. This year’s club is very more diverse. There are so many more people. Last year I think we averaged like 10-15 at a club meeting. [At the last meeting] we almost had like 40 [members present]. The amount of people we have now is so much more and they are so much nicer. Getting to be a part of that and lead this group of nice people to be the next generation of the club but also people. I want to be a teacher so I think about the fact people who sit there in that club one day will be raising kids. And raising kids to be like them and do things that we wish we had. That to me makes me happy. I’m a proud like little mama.  Skylar:  Just being able to feel like, comfortable there. I don’t know if I can feel comfortable like anywhere else if I’m being honest. Like outside of school. sometimes I’ll make like jokes with all my friends and stuff but I like [GSA] because I can say something and nobody’s giving me even the slightest look or change in their demeanor. I wrote down cross the line thing and one of the questions was like “Cross the line if you’re in the LGBTQ community” and a bunch of people crossed. I was thinking “Do I cross or not” and then I just went ahead and did it and nothing happened. Hell didn’t split in half or anything whenever I walked a little bit. It felt comfortable because it was a way to almost say it because it’s like, I don’t know where else to in a sense. Which is cool because it has to be addressed, you can’t just ignore it.   Val: Yeah, no it was more fun to see there were like three ally folks. We are the minority now! {Laughs}   100 Shawn: We did that last year as well. And last year was a lot [heavier]feeling. There was a lot more judgment. This year was a lot more casual and did it in more of a circle. The circle helped even with hard-hitting questions.   Skylar: There was one that was like “Have you purposefully hurt someone” I remember I crossed the line for that one. Some people did and some people didn’t. I feel like we all have, but just being in a space to share that too.   Shawn: There are some really hard-hitting ones and when you cross the line you don’t feel that judgment from other people. You feel that like acceptance of being okay. You have anxiety but then it’s okay and you can let it leave the body.   (Is there anything else that GSA has helped with?)  Riley: GSA helped me come out. I’m still not out to anybody else. Like last year I was in a club called “we dine together.” We had this thing where you had to find somebody who had the same thing as you and then give them a high five. I was like “I like women!” and I high fived someone who was like “Okay” Then this year I was like “I like women and I don’t know what I am” and it was chill. But outside of this space, it’s still like “eh.”  Findings from the GSA displayed how students actively performed agency within their school and community to create safe spaces. When I observed the GSA meeting, two of the three activities offered as options were centered around visibility and advocacy for the queer community. The following excerpt from my fieldnotes describes the advocacy efforts observed: After introducing the card writing option, the sponsor shared other opportunities for students. The first was an opportunity to make personalized bracelets. The intention was to make pride bracelets that reflected their sexual orientation, gender identity, and/or gender expression. Some beads were colored and lettered for students to create with.   The third option was to create flyers, announcements, informational signs, etc. related to solidarity week. The sponsor shares how it was named “Ally Week” in past years but the club chose to rename this event because “everyone deserves quality and fair treatment in school.” The sponsor finished her announcements and summarized the options for students to move between.   Before beginning the activities, the officers share some announcements as well. They shared that November is Trans* Awareness Month and that they would be  101 creating some advocacy events/activities related to this theme. The largest event is Solidarity Week the sponsor discussed.  Students during both focus groups also shared examples of efforts to make queer identities visible in the school and advocate for change. For example, Peyton said: One other thing, [GSA] usually organizes at least a few events every year to draw more attention to the club and more attention to issues with the community. Last year they did a day of silence and had people sign up to pledge to be silent the entire day as a form of protest. I know several people who did it and I’m pretty sure nearly every class that day had at least one day that had taken a pledge of silence.  Although Skylar had shared that some students did not appreciate the Day of Silence, they also shared how it overall was an effective protest: It was a really good effective day, but then there were some people who whenever it was right in your face, and it was very, very blunt and said, “I’m not talking because of this” Then they had to confront it head-on. Then they can’t be ignorant about it and act like it’s not there. They’re being dead silent. But other than that, it was a good day.  Membership. Finally, members in both groups expressed the importance of recruiting and retaining members in their organizations. These conversations with students again varied. FFA students discussed increasing their “active” membership numbers and GSA students discussed barriers for students to join the GSA.  FFA students discussed the differences between active (e.g., students who are enrolled in agriculture courses and participate in the FFA) and inactive members (e.g., students who are enrolled in agriculture courses but do not participate in the FFA). To increase the number of active members, Blair (FFA Focus Group Two) shared about efforts being made to encourage and recognize members: Yeah. And like this year, we’re {points to Bailey} on public relations together and we wanted freshmen to be more involved. So, we started a new thing this year [called] the member of the month. So, like instead of us just having our  102 [Supervised Agricultural Experience] and our officer and executive team spotlights we started involving freshman and sophomore and newer people, so they got a chance to be recognized too.  Aspen, Alex, and Adrian (FFA Focus Group One) had a similar conversation about encouraging new members to participate:  Aspen: In FFA they don’t like to discourage people to not join or be interactive with our club. They’re like “Hey you might like this, if you don’t like this then you don’t have to come back. But you should try it out and see if you like it.”  Alex: I think that it gives people a kind of place to be away from all the other stuff in school and be themselves and be open about things.  Adrian: I would say our FFA chapter is really good about making sure that everyone wants to be involved and getting people to have fun and be themselves and allowing them to be themselves.   Andy: And that everyone feels included.  FFA members also discussed the impacts of membership dues and the presence of non-members at FFA meetings. Andy shared: Okay, so whenever we did not have to pay to be in FFA there were lots of kids there that were there to skip classes. They would talk in the back when we were having meetings and everything else. Then whenever we had to start paying again, we all got really close because they are the people who really wanted to be there. Not just people who wanted to be there to hang out.   I also noted the presence of non-members in the back of the meeting room in my fieldnotes. I wrote, “There are some students in the back of the auditorium from other classes that did not have a substitute to watch students who were not attending club meetings during this period.”  Students in the GSA also shared the importance of membership. However, students were concerned about the sincerity of new members and barriers for students to  103 join the organization. Interviewees in the first GSA focus group shared about challenges to joining the GSA: Parker:  Yeah, I actually think the worst group of people are probably the freshman. They are the most annoying and outspoken about it. When we were signing up for clubs, I had a whole bunch of like conservative freshmen ask me {in a harassing tone} “Did you sign up for GSA? Did you sign up for GSA?” I know like at least us three {pauses and points to Reagan & Reese}; they have harassed us for several years now because we are more outspoken about it. We don’t just sit there and listen to what they have to say we will say something about it if it’s not right.   Peyton: So, one thing that I think about is that club members and administrators do the best they can to encourage people to join the club and make it an inclusive space. But uh I know a lot of people are really worried about how their membership in a club could get back to their parents or get back to like uh people who would not appreciate it. I had someone earlier this year ask me if my parents knew I was in GSA. Yeah, in fact, they were really happy to hear that I was in GSA because one of them had heard people trash-talking it. They were happy that I was a member. She replied to me and said, “Oh I could never tell my parents, I am so worried about it.”  (Do you think people can join as allies in the club?)    Reagan: We have allies in the club.   Parker:  Yeah, I feel like a lot of allies are hesitant about [joining]. They think that it’s just for people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community. But we do have a good number of allies.   Presley: You also have the fear of going into it and someone thinking “Oh well this person is part of the LGBTQ+ community.” So, there’s that sense of hesitation because they don’t want to be seen as something they’re not.   Owen: There’s a lot of like I guess people are definitely worried about being harassed. I have been harassed for being part of the LGBT community. And in this school, for many years, as somebody that’s a senior, it is crazy to me that is still happening to [younger people].   Summary of the Findings  In conclusion, data analysis resulted in four unique themes described in this chapter. Research question one was answered with the themes of Lack of Administrative  104 Oversight. First, the lack of guidance on bullying/harassment led to several intersecting systems of oppression present in the school including heterosexism, cisgenderism, racism, sexism, and religious intolerance. Second, the lack of administrative oversight regarding mutual respect created social divides (e.g., accepting versus unaccepting students) in the school. Third, the lack of administrative guidance provided to staff created variations in the acceptance of queer students by staff members. Research question two was answered from the theme of GSA Perceptions of the FFA. Findings from question two depict barriers toward the inclusion of queer individuals in the FFA, given strong ties to conservative ideologies and traditional expectations for gender expression. Research question three was answered from the theme of FFA Perceptions of the Queer Community. Findings from question three emphasize a wide array of acceptance of queer individuals in the FFA. Finally, research question four was answered with the theme of Comparisons Between the Two Youth Organizations. Findings from this theme described the differences (a) in acceptance and support from the community, (b) the opportunities afforded or restricted to each organization, (c) acceptance and inclusion of diverse identities, and (c) organizational values. Findings are further summarized and discussed in Chapter Five.  105 CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSION Restatement of Research Problem Secondary schools have been cited as hostile environments for queer and questioning youth in the United States (Kosciw et al., 2022).` There are several explanations as to why this is the case for queer students as well as the variations of experience for multiply marginalized identities within the queer community (Chan et al., 2019; Crenshaw, 1991). However, schools have improved the experiences of queer youth through Gender and Sexuality Alliances (Mayberry, 2012; Mayo, 2013; Truong et al., 2021). What was unknown, was the impact of another youth organization (the National FFA Organization) on the experiences of queer youth.  Findings in this study depict (1) a lack of administrative oversight negatively impacting queer students; (2) poor perceptions between the two groups; and (3) differences in community support, opportunities, socialization, and organizational values. Several recommendations are made to school district officials, teachers, and staff in the school to create a safer school for queer students. Discussion, Recommendations, and Implications  This qualitative case study sought to explain the experiences of queer students who were enrolled in, or exposed to, school-based agricultural education (SBAE) programs in a rural high school to fill in gaps in the literature. The research questions which guided this study were: 1. How do students view the overall school culture toward the queer community? 2. Why do queer students engage with (or not engage with) the FFA? 3. How do students in the FFA perceive the queer students in the school?   106 4. How do the experiences of members of the GSA and the FFA chapter compare?  Research Question One Discussion The first research question sought to answer how students viewed the overall culture of the school regarding the queer community. The theme of Lack of Administrative Oversight emerged during the case study as the main explanation of the school culture toward queer youth. There were various stories shared and observations made where there was a lack of consistency in intervention from the administrators causing the three sub-themes (Oppressive Systems in the School, School Social Norms and Perceptions, and Staff Influence on School Culture) to emerge.  These sub-themes were attributed to a lack of administrative intervention given findings in the literature. Current literature depicted the influence administration has on creating safe, welcoming, and inclusive spaces for queer students (Beck, 2020; Bishop & McClellan, 2016; Gower et al., 2018; Kosciw et al., 2013, 2022; Meyer, 2008). Administrative policies directly influence the ability of teachers to intervene in homophobic/transphobic harassment and the day-to-day culture of the school (Meyer, 2008; Payne & Smith, 2011).  The theoretical frameworks for this study guided my thinking at the systemic levels of oppression, which found several systems of oppression present during data analysis. Intersectionality emphasized the importance of identifying the socially constructed systems impacting the experiences of students in this case study (Misra et al., 2020). In addition to allowing systemic levels of analysis to emerge, intersectionality was integral in explaining the presence of multiple systems of oppression present in this case study (Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991). Structural influences, as described by Crenshaw  107 (1991), specifically explain the way societal forces in this case (racism, sexism, heterosexism, cisgenderism, and religious intolerance) reinforced each other and the culture of the school.  With the theoretical frameworks in mind, it is important to acknowledge the various institutions in education and policy which have led to the inability of administrators and teachers in the school to cultivate a safe learning environment for queer students and their various intersections of identities. For example, higher education institutions have inadequately prepared the administrators and teachers in the school to counter hateful behavior and speech in the school.  Previous studies support the lack of preparation that teachers (Meyer, 2008; Page, 2017; Robinson & Ferfolja, 2002); school psychologists and counselors (Heck et al., 2014); and administrators (Meyer, 2008; Payne & Smith, 2011) receive to teach queer students. The lack of oversight observed from the administrators in this case study, and the subsequent inability of teachers to respond to hateful rhetoric, can be attributed to the lack of training for educators. Therefore, queering pedagogy and practice in education (Britzman, 1995; Meyer, 2008) must happen systemically in educational institutions; especially at the post-graduate level.  Pre-service programs for educators – teachers, psychologists, counselors, and administrators alike – must be willing to deconstruct the heteronormative and cisnormative ideals present in educational institutions set forth through White-binary expectations of teacher professionalism and the lack of preparation for educating queer students. Specifically, all pre-service educators should receive ample education about (a) privilege and oppression in education; (b) queer history and topic; (c) best practices for  108 educating queer students and their various intersections of identities; (d) best practices for combatting hostile school environments; and (e) strategies to queering curricula and policies in schools.  Oppressive Systems in the School. Most notably, there was evidence of heterosexism and cisgenderism present in the case study. Heterosexism was first noted during my observation at the FFA meeting when I heard several homophobic comments made by members including “This is SO gay!” Ashton (FFA Focus Group One) also described the use of the slurs faggot and queer by students in the school. Val (GSA Focus Group Two) also described the presence of heterosexism sharing an experience where a same-sex couple was attacked with rocks for holding hands at school.  During the second FFA focus group, Blair and Bailey (FFA Focus Group Two) both shared how they felt gay students in the school are often “too vocal” and try to “shove it down your throat.” I of course, as a queer individual, was very hurt by this statement but also was intrigued as to why these two students felt this way. I’m very interested in this dynamic between students advocating for themselves and their community and the views of the dominant/oppressive group. The dominant group still largely dictates how queer students in this school must exist. Queer students breaking their silence over oppression and hostility were seen as too much, too vocal, or being “shoved down our throats.” So, what then is just enough or smaller doses of queerness that will be accepted? While I think there is some truth to knowing how to approach certain individuals, is it fair to force the student who experiences oppression to assimilate in their pursuit of liberation? A standard and expectation are being put forth by these two students of what will be accepted and how they will accept gay/queer students.   109 Queer theory assists in understanding the implications of this finding as it explains the way heteronormativity is maintained through power dynamics and social norms (Henderson, 2019a; Tierney & Dilley, 1998). Silencing homosexual voices and experiences maintains heterosexuality as the norm and homosexuality as the other. Additionally, silencing/tolerating those who are homosexual maintains the power held by heterosexual individuals in this case. Students demonstrated this when they used othering language using terms like “them” (Blake, FFA Focus Group Two) when describing gay students. While the students were making hateful comments, this finding speaks to the inability of the administration to willingly acknowledge oppression occurring in the school due to the lack of guidance given by administrators. There was also evidence of cisgenderism present in the school as well. I noted the presence of cisgenderism during the FFA meeting I observed from the official dress and the Brotherhood Pledge. While students may choose whether or not to participate in the pledge, and female students may now wear pants in the FFA, the presence of these expectations is rooted in cisnormative values. Both traditions date back to the origins of the FFA as an all-White-male organization and thus represent these values.  Students in the focus groups further confirmed the presence of cisnormativity in the school. Ashton (FFA Focus Group 1) and several of the GSA participants shared experiences where (1) students used slurs, (2) teachers and students refused to use chosen names/pronouns, and (3) violence and harassment targeted gender-diverse individuals. Considering the systems of heterosexism and cisgenderism, it is evident there were more social consequences in this case for students experiencing cisgenderism. This is supported by notions of gender expression in queer theory (Meyer, 2007) and in the  110 literature (McBride, 2020). However, the findings in this study could be skewed, as most students interviewed shared identities within the trans* community, and few shared experiences related to sexuality.  The lack of administrative guidance on creating safe and inclusive learning environments also created oppressive systems for racial and religious minorities and female students in the school. There was a lack of guidance regarding what was allowed to be worn at school in the dress code and by whom. This gave way to racist symbols being worn and the rules in the dress code disproportionately affecting female students. Additionally, there was a lack of administrative oversight in ensuring a separation of church and state, which gave way to religious intolerance in the school.  From a theoretical perspective, these intersecting oppressive systems were created and maintained by structural powers in this school (i.e., administrators; Crenshaw, 1991; Nichols & Stahl, 2019; Tierney & Dilley, 1998). Therefore, it is recommended that the school staff and administration conduct a robust assessment of the policies and guidelines provided to staff and students. Comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies which include protections for sexual orientation and gender identity/expression have been proven to improve school climates (Kosciw et al., 2022; Kull et al., 2016). This assessment should be followed by professional development for intervention techniques to respond to hateful rhetoric and behavior in school. A similar review should be conducted with the school dress code to address (a) disproportionate referrals based on gender identity and (b) banning hateful clothing/apparel.  School Social Norms and Perceptions. In addition to the oppressive systems created, the lack of administrative oversight gave way to disrespectful social norms  111 between groups in the school. Specifically, there were several stereotypes for groups and divides between accepting and unaccepting individuals in the school, which indicated a lack of respect among students. FFA members mostly described how cliques in the school often negatively influenced school culture. Specifically, students in the FFA felt each clique held a stereotype. For FFA members, they described this as the “ag stereotype.” FFA members described this stereotype as being less educated than other individuals because they worked in agriculture. However, Adrian (FFA Focus Group 1) felt this was because other students were “jealous” of the FFA members' opportunities. Regardless of the reason, the presence of a stereotype for agriculture students depicted a culture of disrespect in the school for the various programs offered and members of each program.  Conversely, GSA members mostly described the influence of political ideology and mindset on the acceptance and inclusion of identities. Members discussed a large divide in the school between progressive ideologies/open-mindedness and conservative ideologies/closed-mindedness. Throughout the interviews, participants from the GSA described how acceptance of queer identities typically coincided with open-minded individuals. GSA members had seen an improved culture compared to previous years and again attributed this to a more open mindset of new teachers and the community. GSA members also discussed the stereotypes in the school but attributed them to identities rather than interests. Interviewees described how the GSA was used to stereotypically identify students as a member of the queer community, which restricted possibilities in the group.  112 This difference between FFA and GSA members was explained by both intersectionality and queer theory. Both critical theories emphasize oppression caused by the cultural value placed upon identities, not interests, to privilege certain identities over others (Collins, 2015; Crenshaw, 1991; Meyer, 2007). Therefore, it is unsurprising how students in the GSA, who shared experiences of oppression from various marginalized identities, focused on the acceptance/rejection of their identities. While being a member of the FFA and agriculture program may be a core identity to some of the students who were interviewed, and likely holds a stereotype in the school, it is an identity that can be chosen, unlike identities within the scope of the theoretical frameworks.  Staff Influence on School Culture. The third sub-theme which depicted the lack of administrative oversight’s impact on queer students was the influence of school staff members. Students in both organizations discussed the influence of staff members and included examples of support and harassment. During my interactions with the FFA advisors, it was evident they were passionate about education and truly loved their students. FFA students valued the relationships with their teachers and felt they were more helpful and encouraging than other teachers in the school.  Interviewees from the GSA shared similar sentiments for their club sponsors. However, GSA students emphasized the importance of identifying their club sponsors as accepting adults. Members like Peyton and Reese (GSA Focus Group One) noted feeling more comfortable with the teachers and their classes because of their involvement with GSA. These support findings from the literature regarding the importance of queer students being able to identify supportive staff members (Kosciw et al., 2022). During my  113 observation, I noted the positivity, use of inclusive language, and social-emotional strategies of the GSA sponsors as examples of displaying support for queer students.  Unfortunately, the need to identify accepting adults came from prior experiences of harassment from staff members in the school. Parker (GSA Focus Group One) specifically shared about how teachers and administrators often did not intervene when they heard homophobic rhetoric in the school. Presley (GSA Focus Group One) also shared the negative perceptions teachers and administrators had of the GSA and its members.  As noted in previous themes, teachers would frequently misgender students, deadname transgender students, and had outed students to their parents. Again, these findings support literature depicting staff contributing to the homophobic and transphobic discourse in schools (Kosciw et al., 2022). Several professional development workshops should be offered to teachers, staff, administrators, and substitute teachers as it has been found to increase their ability to proactively address heterosexism and cisgenderism (Meyer, 2008; Vega et al., 2012). Based on the findings, these workshops should center around: (a) the importance of proper use of chosen names and pronouns for students, (b) implicit biases of staff members which impact queer youth, (c) visibly supporting and acknowledging queer students, and (d) social justice practices and pedagogies.  Research Question Two Discussion  Research question two sought to explain why queer students engaged, or did not engage, with the FFA organization. Only one student, Riley (GSA Focus Group Two), had been a member of both organizations. This discussion is limited to one student’s perspective; however, it still provides insight into a potentially hostile culture in the FFA.  114 Riley shared distaste for the FFA because of: (a) harassment for their identity as gender fluid, (b) harassment for promoting feminist issues, and (c) hearing racist and homophobic comments made by students in the FFA. Riley shared they were no longer a member of the FFA but still enrolled in the agriculture pathway. The experiences shared by Riley support findings from the Oppressive Systems in the School sub-theme where FFA members were found to contribute to oppressive systems in the school. While these experiences of Riley can be supported by current literature depicting barriers to the inclusion of minority students in SBAE and FFA (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Vincent & Austin, 2021), more students in the school should be interviewed to determine if this harassment was an isolated incident or is systemic in the culture of the FFA. While Riley was the only member who had been involved in both organizations, Owen (GSA Focus Group One) had poor interactions with FFA members. When I first asked about the FFA organization, I got lots of blank stares at the first GSA Focus Group. I further explained about how it was part of the agriculture program which stimulated some discussion. They said students in the agriculture pathway were rude and racist. Additionally, other GSA members shared how they perceived the agriculture pathway as a conservative career field. Members of the GSA felt more attracted to progressive and adaptive career fields. Again, this discussion is limited to a few students’ perceptions of the agriculture program. Since many were not familiar with the FFA, the students may have associated all the students who fit the ‘ag stereotype’ into this group. More research is needed to identify concrete perceptions of the FFA.  115 Research Question Three Discussion  The third research question sought to explain how FFA members perceived students in the queer community and the GSA. Again, only one FFA member (Ashton, FFA Focus Group One) was familiar with the GSA. Ashton chose not to join the GSA because they felt it was not inclusive to ally members – defeating the purpose of the GSA entirely. This finding is supported by literature on GSA membership, with most GSA members identifying in the queer community as opposed to identifying as an ally (Truong et al., 2021). From personal experiences in the queer community, I can understand both Ashton’s sentiments as well as the desires of GSA members to have a safe space for queer students within the hostile school environment. Again, this is limited to one student’s perception, and I recommend the sponsors of the GSA assess the inclusivity of ally membership within the organization. This assessment should consider the perspectives of queer and ally students to identify ways to increase allyship within the school and the purpose/mission of the GSA in this case.  This theme further depicted dissonance among the FFA members. While there were some accepting individuals, there was evidence of hateful individuals in the organization, which may be a barrier to the inclusion of queer students in the FFA. It is difficult to fully encompass this array of responses from students given the voluntary nature of the case study. Students who express more hateful/unaccepting behaviors in the FFA were likely uninterested in my study. However, from my personal experiences in the FFA, I would support the wide array of acceptance among FFA members and teachers. Future research is needed to continue to investigate perceptions FFA members have of the queer community to fully explain this finding.  116 Research Question Four Discussion  There were several comparisons to be made between the two groups. While students shared commonalities in the topics being discussed, they were approaching each from extremely different perspectives. Findings centered around the influence of the community setting and members, affordance and restriction of club opportunities, perceptions of the club’s diversity, and organizational values and membership.  Community Setting and Members. The first comparison emerged from the findings describing the influence of the community on the school culture. Much like the last two themes, there were opposite views of the influence of community members on the school culture. FFA members shared positive aspects to living in a small, rural area including the ability to grow up with their peers in school. Additionally, FFA members shared the strong tradition of FFA in the community. Members like Bailey, Blair, and Blake (FFA Focus Group 2) all shared how their families encouraged them to join the FFA. FFA members also felt supported by the community through their FFA Alumni chapter which helped fund and organize events throughout the year. Interviewees from the FFA also shared their positive perceptions of social media and felt their online presence was better than other organizations in the school.  These notions of tradition from the FFA support current literature for schools in rural communities. Current literature described the value of tradition in rural schools (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009; Lee, 2019) which contributes to the heteronormative and cisnormative culture in this case. There is a lot of value in the FFA chapter and its’ traditions by the community.  117 From the perspective of the GSA members, the influence of the community was detrimental to their safety, acceptance, and ability to conduct club events. Living in a small, rural town removed protective factors for queer students. For example, Riley, Skylar, and Shawn (GSA Focus Group Two) shared how everyone knew everyone in the small town and their parents were very close with the teachers. The close relationships teachers had with students led to gossip about students. Reagan (GSA Focus Group 1) shared how the tight-knit nature of the community led to them being outed by their teacher to their parents. Other stories were shared during the focus groups which shared similar sentiments. Interviewees from the GSA also described the negative perceptions of the GSA in the community. Students shared about petitions to remove the GSA and harassment of transgender students online.  Again, these findings support literature depicting the influence of the community setting and its members on the experiences of queer students in schools. The influence of parents’ connections with the school has been a challenge for queer students in other schools (Lee, 2019). Additionally, students in this study support the challenges of feeling isolated in rural areas (Holman & Oswald, 2016), gaining community support (Meyer, 2008), and facing hostile school environments in rural communities (Kosciw et al., 2014). The responses from GSA and FFA members were very different. While FFA students valued the closeness of the community and the support received, GSA students were not as fond of the community's influence and setting. From my personal experiences, I would support this finding. The FFA chapter I was a member of was one of the original chapters in my state, founded in 1929. It had large support in the rural community given the tradition of agriculture in my hometown. At the same time, the  118 closeness of my hometown is one of the greatest apprehensions I had about sharing my sexuality with others. When I did come out after leaving my hometown, I remember being approached by individuals I had not spoken to in years because of the closeness and gossip in my town.  Given the large pushback the GSA received from the community, there are several recommendations to be made for the school. I support the recommendation from Truong et al. (2021) for the administration to be more vocal in their support of the GSA, and queer students, in response to parental pushback and harassment. Additionally, I encourage school staff and administrators to consider opportunities for community education about queer identities and issues. Finally, I encourage the school and GSA to consider creating a GSA parent support group. This could mirror other booster clubs in the school, like the FFA Alumni, to help provide opportunities for GSA members and increase community support for the GSA.   Affordance and Restriction of Club Opportunities. When comparing the experiences of the two organizations, there were large differences in the opportunities afforded to each group. This comparison emerged from the intersectionality framework which analyzed the relations between oppression and opportunity (Harris & Patton, 2019). From this lens, there was a stark difference in the opportunities afforded to the students in the GSA and the FFA. FFA members shared their immense opportunities given through FFA to (a) engage in leadership development, (b) travel to other counties and states, and (c) travel overnight. However, GSA members shared how they are still fighting for visibility and acceptance in the school and are denied opportunities to travel, even within the county. This can be further attributed to the membership of FFA being  119 mostly White, heterosexual, and cisgender, while the GSA is mostly comprised of queer individuals.  Given the differences in opportunities between the two organizations, several recommendations can be made. From a theoretical lens, administrators must consider the intersectionality of opportunity and oppression evident between the two groups (Nichols & Stahl, 2019). To ensure equitable access to opportunities, I support the recommendation from Truong et al. (2021) for school district officials to provide the GSA with greater support and resources to conduct activities. Additionally, the administration needs to assess the opportunities being afforded to students to identify inequities in opportunities for student travel.   Perceptions of Diversity. The differences in the club’s perceptions of diversity first arose in the School Social Norms and Perceptions sub-theme. However, in this section, I made comparisons between students’ appreciation and acceptance of differences. This stems from the findings of their values of diverse interests versus identities. FFA members shared their appreciation of diverse interests with me as they shared being a more inclusive chapter because they wear skinny jeans and vans. However, GSA members shared how members create an accepting and safe environment around the identities present in the club. From the theoretical frameworks, it is again assumed the FFA contributes to oppressive experiences by refusing to acknowledge diverse identities. This focus on interests is problematic as it dehumanizes experiences of marginalized identities and maintains a culture of dominance and oppression in the school (Harris & Patton, 2019).  120 Values and Membership. Finally, students in each group placed a large value on the membership status of individuals as active or inactive. Students in the FFA focused on recruitment efforts from their agriculture courses and increasing active membership. However, GSA members focused on the barriers to joining the organization due to perceptions in the school. Additionally, students in both organizations shared common values of socialization in the organization. However, GSA students emphasized the need to create safe spaces in the school and were drawn to the GSA for authentic socialization. Students valued the open-minded individuals who were drawn to the GSA and being able to identify students who had similar experiences in school. GSA interviewees shared their ability to express themselves authentically and to feel accepted. The GSA also served as an opportunity to perform agency in the school by advocating for queer issues. Each of these findings supports the roles of GSAs in schools found in the literature (Mayberry, 2012; Mayo, 2013; Russell et al., 2009; Truong et al., 2021). Recommendations for the Two Organizations To truly liberate those in the FFA who experience oppression, assumptions of binary gender identities and expressions in the official dress and Brotherhood Pledge should be removed. Considering this recommendation for the FFA organization targets customs, traditions, and values of the national model at large, it should be considered within the case and nationally. Additionally, FFA advisors in the school should address the depictions of the confederacy and violence observed during the meeting. This could be achieved through (a) addressing the concern with students directly and (b) pre-screening music played during meetings.   121 For the Gay-Straight Alliance in the case, I recommend considering a name change to Gender and Sexuality Alliance. Students emphasized greater harassment for students with diverse gender identities and expressions in comparison to sexuality. Shifting the name toward Gender and Sexuality Alliance can provide an opportunity to address cisgenderism and sexism in the school. Additionally, this name can be seen as more inclusive to ally members who are concerned about joining.  Recommendations for Practitioners in Similar Contexts Due to the nature of qualitative work, recommendations are most applicable to the specific case and are therefore focused on this specific school. While I caution against generalizing the findings outside of this case, the recommendations could be helpful in similar contexts as findings from this case supported similar studies in rural communities (Gottschalk & Newton, 2009; Lee, 2019), queer youth in schools (Kosciw et al., 2022), and barriers to inclusion in the FFA and SBAE (Barajas, 2021; Barajas et al., 2020; Murray et al., 2020). For practitioners in similar contexts (e.g., rural high schools, primarily White students and teachers, Career and Technical Education/SBAE available), I recommend ensuring there is a Gender and Sexuality Alliance in the school. Just the presence of the GSA in the school has been found to improve experiences of queer and questioning students (Swanson & Gettinger, 2016). Recent data shows a decrease in GSA availability nationally (Truong et al., 2021) and schools should ensure there are GSAs available to students.   122 Recommendations for Future Research Several recommendations exist for future research as well. While this study provides insight into the experiences of rural queer youth engaged in agricultural education, there are more stories to be shared. Future scholars in SBAE should consider replicating this study in other schools. However, scholars who wish to replicate the study should be aware of the various challenges faced while conducting this study. First, while it was difficult to locate schools which had an FFA and GSA, it was even more difficult to find a school where all parties (administration, advisors/sponsors) agreed to the project. During this process, several SBAE teachers were unwilling to participate or had never heard of a GSA. In other cases, the administrators were unwilling to have such a project. Future research should assess potential biases of educators and administrators alike which could explain this hesitation to participate. Additionally, research should be conducted assessing SBAE teachers specifically and potential systemic barriers to inclusion for queer students in SBAE and FFA.  Second, given the nature of researching two vulnerable populations, navigating the Institutional Review Board was difficult. Some of the original design was modified to protect the participants which constrained the context of some stories. For example, demographic information for the study was not collected to protect the anonymity of the participants but would have provided additional context to some of the stories shared. Finally, it should be noted the inability to conduct this study after SB150 passed in Kentucky. In fact, many of the recommendations made in this thesis are now illegal to mandate and/or implement into this school. Or in any school in the Commonwealth.  123 However, despite these challenges, I encourage scholars to persevere for the benefit, and the lives, of queer students. Final Words As I reflect on the overall study, I am extremely grateful for the bravery of the students in this study. There were times during the focus groups where students expressed strong emotion and shared their stories with me – a stranger. These students were far braver than I ever was in high school. While there is work to be done in this school, and schools across the United States, I find comfort in the fact these students have been able to transform their experiences in school through the GSA. Students in the GSA specifically have shown immense strength in their ability to create a liberated space in the school. I am also extremely grateful to know there were students and teachers in the FFA who were seen as accepting toward the queer community by Ashton. As I left the first FFA focus group, I remember feeling relieved there were accepting individuals in the FFA given my past experiences. While there was not an overall culture of acceptance in the FFA, I am grateful to know Ashton saw the advisors as inclusive people and was able to find safety and acceptance.   However, as a society, we must do better. These students are observant of the implicit ways others show their views of queerness. No child should ever fear their safety in school, especially because of the attitudes of teachers or parents.  It breaks my heart to hear students sharing how adults harassed them in school and online. Forcing them to ask themselves “Should I just sit here and take it or what do I do?” (Owen, GSA Focus Group One).   124 It breaks my heart to hear students share how people in their school “choose not to acknowledge” them (Skylar, GSA Focus Group Two).  It breaks my heart to see such an increase in visibility and representation since my time in high school, yet such little change in acceptance. It breaks my heart to hear how students were concerned about anti-transgender bills being passed in Kentucky, and three short months later some of the most restrictive bills in the country on gender-affirming care for transgender youth have been introduced and have now passed into Kentucky legislation; making many of my recommendations to create safer and more equitable schools for queer children illegal in this state. These children deserve better.  Queer children deserve better.  Transgender children deserve better.  All children, regardless of identity, deserve educators – teachers, school counselors, school psychologists, social workers, principals, and superintendents alike – who are willing to fight for and protect them. I share the sentiments of Payne and Smith (2011) who state, “…it is essential for educators to understand that they do not get to choose which youth are deserving of an education or which youth are entitled to safety in walking down a school corridor. Their responsibility is to act” (p. 198). I challenge those who read this to act. To do better. I end with the sentiments of Ashton (FFA Focus Group One): “We’re all different; we all come from different places. Why can’t we all just come together? We’re all people.”  125 APPENDICES Appendix A - IRB Approval    126 Appendix B – Focus Group Interview Protocol Common Interview Questions • How would you describe the culture of your school?  o Is it inclusive to queer students?

    "abstract": "Secondary schools in the United States are hostile environments for students in the queer community. Schools in rural communities often pose greater challenges for queer students with less access to affirming and accepting educators. Rural schools often offer school-based agricultural education (SBAE) and the National FFA Organization as opportunities for students. Both programs have been found as unwelcoming environments for underrepresented groups, with little known about the experiences of queer students. To address hostility toward queer youth, schools have implemented Genders and Sexualities Alliances (GSAs) as an opportunity to discuss queer topics and create safe spaces. This qualitative case study sought to share the intersectional lived experiences of students in the FFA and GSA and explain their experiences with school climate, rural communities, and the two youth organizations of interest. Findings depict a hostile school culture for queer students in the school due to a lack of administrative oversight and negative perceptions of the GSA in the school and community. Recommendations from this work include professional development for teachers, staff, administrators, and community members along with revisions to anti-bullying and dress code policies",
