Stephanie Coontz, Op-Ed., Taking Marriage Private, N.Y. Times, Nov. 26, 2007, atA23.2669FORDHAMLA WREVIEWincreasingly begun to ask.2 But the fact that it was raised so publicly in ayear in which the nation celebrates the fortieth anniversary of the U.S.Supreme Court's landmark decision in Loving v. Virginia is neverthelessstriking. 3Loving is a landmark decision and, significantly, one of the Court's mostimportant cases on matters of marriage. 4 It is the first Supreme Court caseto recognize that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 5 And yet, perhaps curiously, theCourt never discussed the threshold issue whether it was appropriate for thestate of Virginia to play a role in deciding who could and could not marry.Rather, the question Chief Justice Earl Warren addressed in his opinion forthe Court was whether Virginia, in enforcing its antimiscegenation laws,6could deny permission to marry on the ground that the individualsrequesting it were of different races. 7 The basic legitimacy of the state'srole as the gatekeeper for marriage was a foregone conclusion.2. See, e.g., Martha Albertson Fineman, Why Marriage?, 9 Va. J. Soc. Pol'y & L. 239,245 (2001) (reflecting on various meanings and constructions of civil marriage and arguingthat \"for all relevant and appropriate societal purposes we do not need marriage, per se, atall\"); Charles J. Reid, Jr., And the State Makes Three: Should the State Retain a Role inRecognizing Marriage?, 27 Cardozo L. Rev. 1277 (2006) (considering the \"privatization\" ofmarriage and the appropriate role of the state); Katharine B. Silbaugh, The Practice ofMarriage, 20 Wis. Women's L.J. 189 (2005) (criticizing, inter alia, the state's use ofmarriage to control social issues); Barbara Stark, Marriage Proposals: From One-Size-Fits-All to Postmodern Marriage Law, 89 Cal. L. Rev. 1479 (2001) (calling for a laissez-faireapproach to marriage \"privatization\"); see also Anita Bernstein, For and Against Marriage:A Revision, 102 Mich. L. Rev. 129, 142 (2003) (engaging calls to eliminate state-sponsoredmarriage, but concluding that marriage best satisfies the need for regulation in our\"[i]ntimate lives\"); Summer L. Nastich, Questioning the Marriage Assumptions: TheJustifications for \"Opposite-Sex Only\" Marriage as Support for the Abolition of Marriage,21 Law & Ineq. 114 (2003) (exploring the redistribution of the legal benefits of marriage byabolishing legal marriage).3. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967).4. See R.A. Lenhardt, The Story of Perez v. Sharp: Forgotten Lessons on Race,Marriage, and Family, in Race Law Stories 341, 341-42 (Devon W. Carbado & Rachel F.Moran eds., 2008).5. See id. at 365-66. Some scholars argue that, because of the dual grounds-race andmarriage-on which Loving was decided, the first clear articulation of the due process rightto marry did not come until Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374 (1978), which declaredunconstitutional a Wisconsin statute requiring any person with child-support obligations toget court approval before being permitted to marry. See, e.g., Joseph A. Pull, Questioning theFundamental Right to Marry, 90 Marq. L. Rev. 21, 31 (2006).6. At the time Loving was decided, Virginia had several statutes concerningmiscegenation. See Loving, 388 U.S. at 4-7. One of the statutes the Lovings were found tohave violated provided, in relevant part, that, \"[i]f any white person intermarry with acolored person, or any colored person intermarry with a white person, he shall be guilty of afelony and shall be punished by confinement in the penitentiary for not less than one normore than five years.\" Id. at 4. Significantly, this statute was only one of many Virginia hadenacted in its history. The first Virginia law banning interracial marriage was enacted in1691. A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr. & Barbara K. Kopytoff, Racial Purity and Interracial Sexin the Law of Colonial and Antebellum Virginia, 77 Geo. L.J. 1967, 1967 n.5 (1989). Lawsprohibiting sexual intimacy between whites and blacks appeared in the American colonies asearly as 1662. Id. at 1968 n.6 (discussing the first prohibition on interracial sex).7. Loving, 388 U.S. at 2.2670 [Vol. 76INTRODUCTIONThe Lovings, importantly, did not set out to change the way we thinkabout marriage and the state's role in it.8 The aim of these childhoodsweethearts-Mildred Jeter, an African American woman, and RichardLoving, a white man-was actually much more modest.9 After years offorced exile in Washington, D.C., for violating Virginia's prohibition oninterracial marriage,' 0 the Lovings wanted only to secure the right to live asa married couple in their native state.II As Mildred explained years later,\"All we ever wanted was to get married, because we loved each other.Some people will never change, but that's their problem, not mine. Imarried the only man I had ever loved, and I'm happy for the time we had8. See Robert A. Pratt, Crossing the Color Line: A Historical Assessment and PersonalNarrative of Loving v. Virginia, 41 How. L.J. 229, 231 (1998).9. Mildred and Richard Loving grew up together in Central Point, Virginia, acommunity whose racial norms were more relaxed than they were in other parts of the state.Id. at 234. As Robert Pratt explained in his personal essay about the Loving case, interracialintimacy was fairly common in Central Point, so much so that Mildred and Richard's\"budding romance drew little attention from either the white or the black communities\" ofthe town. Id. at 235.10. The Lovings married in 1958 in neighboring Washington, D.C. Id. at 236. At thattime, the state of Virginia refused to recognize not only interracial marriages procured withinits borders, but also those outside of them. Id. When sheriffs' deputies, acting on ananonymous tip, discovered the Lovings living as a married couple in the home of Mildred'sparents, they arrested them and charged them with violating the law. Id. Following grandjury indictments for violation of the state's 1924 Racial Integrity Act, a judge sentenced bothMildred and Richard to a year of imprisonment. Id. Their sentences, however, weresuspended \"on the condition that they leave the state of Virginia and not return together or atthe same time for a period of twenty-five years.\" Id.Significantly, the question of how a state should regard marriages procured outside itsborders that could not have been obtained within them has arisen again in the context ofefforts to secure marriage rights for same-sex couples. Many states, emboldened by thefederal Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress in 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat.2419 (codified at 1 U.S.C. § 7 (2000); 28 U.S.C. § 1738C), have refused to recognizemarriages secured by gays and lesbians in jurisdictions within the United States, such asMassachusetts, or in foreign countries. See Andrew Koppelman, Against Blanket InterstateNonrecognition of Same-Sex Marriage, 17 Yale J.L. & Feminism 205, 206 (2005) (notingthat \"[florty states have laws on the books declaring that they will not recognize foreignsame-sex marriages\"). New York, however, recently indicated that it would recognize suchmarriages. See Martinez v. County of Monroe, 850 N.Y.S.2d 740 (App. Div. 2008) (holdingthat a same-sex marriage obtained in Canada is entitled to recognition in New York); seealso Beth R. v. Donna M., No. 0350284/2007, 2008 WL 696441 (N.Y. Sup. Ct., Feb. 25,2008) (permitting a divorce action involving a same-sex marriage obtained in Canada). Inthis sense, New York's approach is similar to that employed by California and other statespre-Loving. See R.A. Lenhardt, Beyond Analogy: Perez v. Sharp, Antimiscegenation Law,and the Fight for Same-Sex Marriage, 96 Cal. L. Rev. (forthcoming Aug. 2008) (manuscriptat 101, 104-05, 104 n.19, on file with authors). Unlike Virginia, California, which also hadantimiscegenation laws on its books, determined that it would recognize interracialmarriages obtained in other states. Id. (manuscript at 104 n. 19); see also Pearson v. Pearson,51 Cal. 120, 125 (1875) (holding that a marriage \"valid by the law of the place where it wascontracted, is also valid in this State\").11. Richard Loving famously asked one of the attorneys who handled his case in theSupreme Court to \"[t]ell the Court I love my wife, and it is just unfair that I can't live withher in Virginia.\" Pratt, supra note 8, at 239. For a discussion of this and other aspects of theLoving narrative, see Peter Wallenstein, Tell the Court I Love My Wife: Race, Marriage,and Law-An American History (2004).2008] 2671FORDHAM LAW REVIEWtogether. For me, that was enough.\"' 12 In the end, however, the impact ofthe decision in Loving extended far beyond Mildred and Richard'sparticular case.Significantly, Loving received no mention in Professor Coontz's NewYork Times editorial, which argued for the privatization of marriage. 13While Coontz references the identity-based restrictions placed on marriageover the years, 14 she bases her overall argument for relieving states of thepower they have long wielded in the marriage arena not on past abuses ofthat power, but on the notion that society no longer benefits fromgovernmental regulation in this context. 15 The proof of this, Coontzmaintains, can be seen, in part, from the tremendous societal changes thathave occurred in traditional marriage over the last few decades. 16 Divorcerates have skyrocketed since the 1950s and 1960s. 17 Many people nevermarry at all.18 And those who choose to marry are doing so later and laterin life. 19 In short, as Professor Rachel Moran recently noted, marriage nowserves a very different purpose than it did in the past.20 It is no longer a12.

Rev. 359, 372-73, 373 nn.67-68 (2005) (citing various sources,including U.S. Census data, in supporting the fifty percent claim); see also U.S. CensusBureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2008 (2008) (indicating that the divorcerate in the 1980s fell from that in the 1970s, falling to 3.6 divorces per thousand from 5.3 perthousand).18. See Moran, supra note 17, at 269. Nationally, from 1970 to 2006, there was aneighty-seven percent increase in the number of men who never married and an eighty-threepercent increase in the number of women who never married.

Nationally, the estimated median age at firstmarriage rose from 23.2 for men in 1970 to 27.5 in 2006. See U.S. Census Bureau, TableMS-2: Estimated Median Age at First Marriage, by Sex: 1890 to the Present (2007),available at http://www.census.gov/population/sacdemo/hh-fam/ms2.xis. At the same time,the median age for women rose from 20.8 to 25.5. Id.; see also Claudia Goldin, The LongRoad to the Fast Track: Career and Family, 596 Annals Am. Acad. Pol. & Soc. Sci. 20(2004) (tracing the rise in age at first marriage among college-educated women).20. See Moran, supra note 17, at 268-69.2672 [Vol. 76INTRODUCTIONprerequisite for cohabitation or sexual intimacy.21 Nor is a marriage licensenecessary to raise children. 22 Despite the New York Court of Appeals 2006decision in Hernandez v. Robles, which regarded heterosexual marriage as avirtual precondition for the rearing of well-adjusted children, 23 the reality isthat, today, \"[a]lmost 40 percent of America's children are born tounmarried parents.\" 24The significance of these and other similar changes cannot be ignored.As Coontz maintains, they reflect tremendous shifts in the nature of thepersonal and intimate obligations individuals-gay, straight, bisexual, ortransgendered-now have to one another.25 Marriage in the twenty-firstcentury is arguably very different from what Mildred and Richard Lovinghad in mind.26 There is good reason to explore this reality and to engagequestions about the proper place of marriage in contemporary society, giventhe evolution we have witnessed in an institution that the Supreme Courthas described as \"the most important relation in life\" 27 and \"an associationthat promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not politicalfaiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects . . . anassociation for as noble a purpose as any .... -28 It may be, as Coontz andother scholars, including some in this book,29 have suggested, thatmarriage's elevated status in the hierarchy of models for human intimacyand obligation has been undermined by the shifts in societal norms thathave occurred. We submit, however, that it would be futile to try tocomprehend fully the significance of the societal changes that have21. Moran, supra note 17, at 269; Coontz, supra note 1. Along these lines, we no longerstigmatize children born outside of marriage as illegitimate. See Thomas Healy, StigmaticHarm and Standing, 92 Iowa L. Rev. 417, 479 (2007) (arguing that the \"stigma ofillegitimacy has lessened somewhat over time, as the number of illegitimate births hasincreased and as alternative models of the family have become more accepted\"); Linda C.McClain, \"Irresponsible\" Reproduction, 47 Hastings L.J. 339, 350 (1996) (critiquingrhetoric decrying \"the decline in stigma attached to out-of-wedlock births\"); see also Gomezv. Perez, 409 U.S. 535, 537-38 (1973) (holding that state denial of public benefits toillegitimate children violates the equal protection guarantee).22. See Moran, supra note 17, at 269.23. Hernandez v.

Rev. 2685(2008) (contesting the centrality of marriage in claims for gay rights and advocating anincreased focus on other models for human intimacy and obligation).2008] 2673FORDHAM LAW REVIEWoccurred since the 1960s and 1970s in the area of marriage without alsoconsidering Loving and the impact of the Supreme Court's opinion in thatcase. A full determination of where we are with marriage and \"loving\"cannot be made in the absence of a more complete understanding of Loving.Our insistence on placing Loving at the center of any attempt tocomprehend contemporary marital and intimate relations may becounterintuitive to some. After all, we noted at the outset that Loving didnot purport fundamentally to change marriage or the role of the state inregulating it. At the same time, it seems clear that in spite of this and themodest aims of the Loving plaintiffs, the decision in Loving has beentransformative on a number of levels. 30 Indeed, in recent years, it has beenat the forefront of efforts to rethink marriage, the nature of the obligations itimposes, and the role of the state in determining which relationships arelicit and which are illicit. One need only look at recent litigation to securerights for same-sex couples to get some sense of this. Loving has been acenterpiece of litigation efforts waged by advocates for the right of gay andlesbian couples to marry.3' Even more significantly, it figured prominentlyin the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's 2003 decision in Goodridgev. Department of Public Health, which extended marriage rights to gay andlesbian couples in Massachusetts. 32 As the following excerpt highlights,30. Loving has led to changes in cross-racial intimacy. See Randall Kennedy, How AreWe Doing with Loving?: Race, Law, and Intermarriage, 77 B.U. L. Rev. 815, 817-19(1997) (describing, inter alia, Loving as a \"triumph\" for freedom of choice); Pratt, supra note8, 240 (describing the decision's effect on Mildred and Richard Loving personally); TimPadgett & Frank Sikora, Color-Blind Love: Once Considered Taboo, Interracial MarriagesAre Now on the Rise-Even in Some Unexpected Places, Time, May 12, 2003 (unpaginated)(claiming a 1000% increase in the number of interracial marriages since Loving and profilingseveral such couples in Alabama). But its greatest impact may be on thinking about race,marriage, and the law. See John DeWitt Gregory & Joanna L. Grossman, The Legacy ofLoving, 51 How. L.J. 15, 52 (2007) (noting that Loving's legacy has mostly been legal, notcultural, since interracial marriage is still a \"relatively unusual occurrence\"); see alsoReginald Oh, Regulating White Desire, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 463, 508-11 (discussing theimpact of Loving on the legality of racial subordination). But see Rashmi Goel, FromTainted to Sainted: The View of Interracial Relations as Cultural Evangelism, 2007 Wis. L.Rev. 489 (cautioning that Loving failed to address the racist \"cognitive imprint\" that favorsthe white partner in an interracial relationship); Camille A. Nelson, Lovin' the Man:Examining the Legal Nexus of Irony, Hypocrisy, and Curiosity, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 543(same, from Nelson's own personal perspective).31. Loving has been cited and is often discussed at length in major case filings submittedby advocates for the right of same-sex couples to marry. See, e.g., Respondents' OpeningBrief on the Merits, In re Marriage Cases, 149 P.3d 737 (Cal. 2006) (No. A110451);Memorandum of Authorities in Support of All Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgmentand In Support of All Plaintiffs' Resistance to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment,Varnum v.

Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 969.[Vol. 762674INTRODUCTIONthe Goodridge court relied a great deal on Loving and Perez v. Sharp,33 thefirst post-Reconstruction case to invalidate an antimiscegenation law 34 :As both Perez and Loving make clear, the right to marry means little if itdoes not include the right to marry the person of one's choice, subject toappropriate government restrictions in the interests of public health,safety, and welfare.... In this case, as in Perez and Loving, a statutedeprives individuals of access to an institution of fundamental legal,personal, and social significance-the institution of marriage-because ofa single trait: skin color in Perez and Loving, sexual orientation here. Asit did in Perez and Loving, history must yield to a more fully developedunderstanding of the invidious quality of the discrimination.3 5Our objective in planning this fortieth celebration of Loving was todevise a program that would allow us to explore in depth the modemimplications of the Court's 1967 decision in Loving-what it says about thestate's role in intimate relationships, as well as what it might explain aboutrace, family, and the place of marriage in modem society. Too often, theinclination among scholars is to choose between the different aspects ofWarren's opinion for the Court. 36 On the one hand, there are Warren'sstatements about race and the dangers of racial prejudice. The assertion that\"the racial classifications [in Virginia's antimiscegenation statute] muststand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain WhiteSupremacy,\" 37 is viewed as a \"key sentence\" in Loving,38 one absolutelycritical to understanding both issues of race and equality, and the concernsof the Court during this period. 39  On the other hand, there is theaforementioned language about marriage. Warren's conclusion that\"[mlarriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our veryexistence and survival,\" was extremely significant,40 both because of what33. 198 P.2d 17 (Cal. 1948). For more on Perez v. Sharp and its utilization in recentmarriage cases, see Lenhardt, supra note 10.34. See, e.g., Goodridge, 798 N.E.2d at 958-59.35. Id. at 958 (citation omitted).36. Cf Lenhardt, supra note 10 (manuscript at 126).37. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967).38. Cass R. Sunstein, Homosexuality and the Constitution, 70 Ind.

But, as this book attests, we were able, through the incrediblecontributions of the Symposium participants and attendees, to achieve agood part of our goal. On November 2, 2007, scores of legal and nonlegalscholars, practitioners, and students filled the auditorium at FordhamUniversity School of Law to give Loving what, at this point in its forty-yearexistence, may be the very best celebration we could offer: a thorough andin-depth discussion of what it has meant and can mean to those concernedabout matters of race, sexuality, and family in modern society.Each of the four sessions held during the Symposium focused on animportant aspect of Loving and/or loving. The panelists in our openingsession, Historical Perspectives on Race, Sex, and Family, endeavored toput in context the Loving decision and questions regarding the identity-based restrictions that states have historically placed on marriage. ProfessorMaillard, addressing questions of race and collective memory, challengedus to reject the vision of Loving as \"Multiracial Epiphany,\" the idea that itsomehow began or made possible the formation of interracial relationshipsor the existence of mixed race individuals. 62  Through a compellingdiscussion of three \"contemporary disputes over racial identity andmembership\" 63-that concerning Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings,one of his former slaves, and those claiming to be their descendants; that58.

Professor Carlos Ballcontinued the focus on current marriage litigation, broadening thediscussion to concentrate not only on the arguments made by gay advocatesof equal access to marriage, but also those advanced by state officials andjudicial officers. In particular, Ball's essay critiques the emphasis on childrearing in judicial opinions upholding as constitutional bans on marriage forsame-sex couples, demonstrating that similar arguments were made indefense of antimiscegenation laws such as those struck down by Loving.64.

He concludes that these and other social structuring devicesgreatly influence romantic preferences, giving special attention to black-white intimate interactions involving gay men.74Professor Harris of the University of California-Berkeley School of Lawwas magnificent as the conference's keynote speaker. A distinguishedscholar, and leader in Critical Race Theory, Critical Race Feminism, andLatCrit, Harris delivered an address that both synthesized themes raised inthe prior two sessions and compelled the audience and participants to travelto entirely new intellectual territory. In Loving Before and After the Law,Harris considers \"marriage as a practice of national citizenship,\" 75 focusingspecifically on notions of citizenship that bear on the \"possession andenjoyment of certain political, civil, and social rights\"76 and \"activeengagement in the public life of the community.\" 77 In Harris's view, \"thelegacy of Loving v. Virginia looks strikingly different depending on which[of these] ax[e]s of citizenship one chooses to examine.\" 78  From theperspective of rights, Harris-who develops a theory of state power71.

In concluding, Harris points us toward alternatives forpossible reconciliation of these divergent views. Apart from the optionspresented by various forms of political theater, such as queers marrying enmasse and \"heterosexuals ... refus[ing] to get married,\" she emphasizes thenew and productive avenues that might be opened by a critical examinationof prevailing conceptions of family.83Finally, our last session of the day-a panel entitled TransnationalPerspectives on Race, Sex, and Family-followed the path blazed by Harrisin the previous session, turning the focus to the international context and aninquiry into how other countries have handled their own Loving moments,instances when they have been confronted with diverse claims for racial,gender, sexual, or familial diversity. As with the prior sessions, thepanelists provided in-depth and thought-provoking analyses of theconference themes and issues. Professor Chandan Reddy delivered remarksthat considered the challenges for LGBT organizing in the domestic andinternational contexts, advocating the adoption of a new paradigm for queerpolitical engagement. His essay in this book picks up on that theme byexploring the limits of legal efforts to secure marriage rights and equalcitizenship for gay men and lesbians. More specifically, Reddy asks whatgay advocates gain and lose by invoking Loving in current marriagelitigation. 84 Engaging critical texts relevant to his query, Reddy accusesadvocates of living too much in the past and relying on the socialhierarchies and structure that constituted it, concluding that the use ofLoving and the move toward \"the universalization of the right to marriage\"it reflects \"is the very means by which the law forecloses other, possiblymore difficult and imaginative articulations of antiracism.\" 85 In his view,\"the desire for the universal right of marriage is primarily the preservationof an episteme that has lived beyond its utility.

He focusedprimarily on the implications of regarding the Court's 2003 decision inLawrence as one that concerns gay rights alone. Reminding us thatLawrence involved a couple that was gay as well as interracial, Eng urged amore sustained focus on intersectionality and the ways in which legalrestrictions in the area of intimacy can have effects on matters of race andsexuality. For Eng, the success of queer liberalism-which so often entailsan embrace of Loving, as Goodridge and other recent marriage casesattest-should not rest on what amounts to a \"forgetting of race.\"Professors Adrien Wing and Darren Rosenblum took the conversation ina different, but equally productive direction by considering the identity-related implications of international laws and policies bearing on questionsof race and gender. Darren Rosenblum focused on Norway, comparingjudicial efforts to achieve racial equality in Loving with efforts by thelegislature of Norway to secure a level of gender equality for womenthrough the implementation of the Corporate Board Quota (CBQ). In hisessay, Rosenblum urges a renewed focus on the possibilities presented by\"assertive remedies for inequality\" such as quotas. He argues that, in thefinal analysis, Norway's QBC has been more effective than Title IX andother similar measures in the United States for achieving equity throughforms of balancing. In this connection, Rosenblum, while praising theoutcome of Loving, concludes that, as a necessarily passive remedy, it isinherently limited in its ability to facilitate interracial intimate relationships.Employing themes from Critical Race Feminism, as well as personalexperience and narrative, Professor Adrien Wing closed the session and theSymposium by asking how Loving can help us think about the challengesfaced by \"Muslim women who.., want the legal freedom to marry outsidetheir faith,\" something forbidden in most Muslim countries. 87 Her essay inthis book, Twenty-First-Century Loving: Nationality, Gender, and Religionin the Muslim World, explores the multiple race, gender, and family-basedidentities possessed by Muslim women and discusses in detail thechallenges they face both under Islamic family law precepts subordinatingwomen to men and in the secular world, where head scarves and otherindicia of spiritual devotion mark Muslim women as targets for abuse anddiscrimination. Explaining that these forces combine to make lifeextremely difficult for Muslim women who want to enter into interfaithunions, Professor Wing urges a focus on the many ways in which \"[g]enderdiscrimination manifests itself.\"'88 And she offers specific solutions foraddressing the inequities posed by interfaith marriage bans that range frompublic education to legal strategies centered on gender equality provisionscontained in the constitutions of countries in the Muslim world andinternational provisions, such as the International Covenant on Civil and87.

No doubt some will find that there are questions andissues relevant to understanding Loving that were not addressed by thisSymposium or that were explored only superficially. This gathering ofscholars was not, however, meant in any way to close the book on Loving-to somehow wrap up neatly a case that, as the discussion above details,touches on some of the most difficult and complex issues facing oursociety. Like the Lovings, our aim here was ultimately more modest. Inthe end, we wanted simply to launch a critical conversation about theCourt's decision in Loving, one that perhaps complicates as many issues asit resolves. In opening up the discussion, we invite others to join in whatwe expect will be a conversation that continues for at least another fortyyears.89.
