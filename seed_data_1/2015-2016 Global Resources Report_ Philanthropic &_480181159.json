This report captures data on 12,964 grants awarded by 511 foundations, intermediaries, and corporations and by 15 government and multilateral agencies over the two-year period of 2015-2016. It provides detailed data on the distribution of LGBTI funding by geography, issue, strategy, and population focus, offering a tool for identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities in the rapidly changing landscape of LGBTI funding. The 2015-2016 Global Resources Report builds upon the first edition of the Global Resources Report, which was released two years ago and focused on grantmaking in calendar years 2013-2014. With this second volume, we now have comprehensive data on four calendar years of grantmaking, allowing us to conduct a deeper analysis of the trendlines for LGBTI funding over time. In several sections of this report, we offer not only a snapshot of funding for 2015-2016, but also an analysis of how funding has shifted over a four-year period.This second report is the fruit of the continuing collaboration between our two networks, Funders for LGBTQ Issues and the Global Philanthropy Project (GPP). By collaborating throughout every phase of the research, we have been able to draw upon the unique competencies and assets of both networks. The members of the Global Philanthropy Project were instrumental in reaching a wide set of funders and, in particular, in capturing the leading government funders of LGBTI issues. The expertise of GPP’s global membership also helped to assure that the report reflected the interests and needs of a wide variety of funders. Funders for LGBTQ Issues contributed its strong capacities in research and communications, including more than a decade of experience producing the comprehensive annual Tracking Report on LGBTI funding in the U.S., as well as an aptitude for capturing complex data in understandable and visually compelling ways. Note that while the Global Resources Report series is the most comprehensive resource available on LGBTI funding around the world, it still has gaps. In particular, while we have captured information about the majority of funders that award large amounts of funding for LGBTI issues, we know there are some that we missed, including several notable funders unable to submit data for the report for a variety of reasons. We are pleased that this second edition includes over 50 more funders than the first edition, and we hope to be able to include an even larger set of funders in future research. Most importantly, we hope that this report will be a valuable tool for both donors and movement leaders seeking to advance LGBTI rights and improve the wellbeing of LGBTI communities around the world. By better understanding the current scale and scope of LGBTI funding, we can better respond to gaps, advocate for more resources, adapt our goals, and increase our impact. Sincerely,Matthew Hart      Ben Francisco MaulbeckDIRECTOR, GLOBAL PHILANTHROPY PROJECT  PRESIDENT, FUNDERS FOR LGBTQ ISSUES     Introduction 6 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe 2015-2016 Global Resource Report analyzes grant-level data for grants awarded in 2015 and 2016 to support lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex issues. This section provides an overview of the methodology used to document the complex global funding landscape for LGBTI issues today.DEFINING AN “LGBTI GRANT”This report collects and analyzes data on grantmaking that specifically focuses on LGBTI issues. Generally, this includes two sets of grants: (1) grants awarded to organizations that primarily focus on serving or advocating for LGBTI communities; and (2) grants awarded to organizations that serve a larger audience, but for a project that specifically focuses on LGBTI communities. The data do not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of LGBTI people, unless they explicitly address an LGBTI issue or population. For example, a human rights organization receiving a grant to provide asylum services to marginalized refugees, open and welcoming of all refugees, including LGBTI people, would not have been included in the data. If that same human rights organization received a grant to provide asylum services specifically supporting LGBTI refugees, it would have been included. While both LGBTI-focused and LGBTI-inclusive grants can have a significant impact on LGBTI communities, the former category is distinct in that such grants by definition work to proactively address the unique challenges, disparities, and rights abuses faced by LGBTI communities. It is also more practical and feasible to attain a fairly consistent and comprehensive picture of LGBTI-focused grants, while a dataset of LGBTI-inclusive grants could misleadingly inflate the level of support for LGBTI communities and be difficult to map with consistency. SOURCES OF DATAThe Global Resources Report surveyed the grantmaking of over 1,000 philanthropic entities and more than a dozen donor governments in an effort to provide a comprehensive snapshot of global LGBTI funding in the two-year period from 2015-2016. Information was obtained predominantly through self-reporting, with participating foundations, agencies, and organizations providing data on all LGBTI-related grants directly to Funders for LGBTQ Issues. When possible, funders provided information on the grantee, grant amount, and grant description for each individual grant.These data submissions were supplemented by a review of official disclosure documents (such as tax return forms 990 for U.S.-based foundations and nonprofit institutions), annual reports, and online grants databases. All government and multilateral grantmaking was self-reported. QUALITY CONTROL AND CODINGOnce received, grants were reviewed by the research team for consistency and accuracy. In order to maximize consistency and overall quality of data, some grants were eliminated from the dataset if they fell outside the research parameters—for example, if a grant was awarded outside the two-year period of 2015-2016 or if it did not have an explicit LGBTI focus. In some cases where it was difficult to determine whether a grant fell within research parameters for the report, additional information was requested from the submitting funder.Once received and reviewed, grants were then coded by the research team, drawing on information provided both about the grantee and the grant description. In both quality control and coding, the overarching goal was to assure consistency of data.MethodologyGlobal Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities7TYPES OF FUNDERS All types of philanthropic entities were surveyed, including:   > Anonymous funders, which, for the purposes of this report, includes foundations and funds that seek to maintain the anonymity of their giving.  > Corporate foundations and grantmaking programs at for-profit organizations. > Governments, many of which award grants through a range of agencies. > Intermediaries, which are set up to collect funds from other funders and re-grant those funds to civil society organizations and grassroots groups. > Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), which are civil society organizations operating a range of programs, including some that manage grantmaking programs and initiatives. > Multilateral agencies, which are organizations formed by three or more countries for the purpose of joint funding or other types of cooperation. > Private foundations, which are typically endowed foundations originally established by a family or an individual donor.  > Public foundations, which are set up to raise funds from the general public and award grants.Data from individual donors was not collected, unless their funding was awarded through an institutional entity, such as a private foundation or a donor-advised fund housed at a public foundation. For the purposes of this report, government and multilateral agencies are reported in a single category, as are intermediaries, NGOs, and public foundations. Government funding captured in this report focuses on international aid to advance LGBTI rights and for the most part does not capture donor governments’ domestic funding. GRANT AWARDS AND DISBURSEMENTSThis report provides data on grant awards as opposed to grant disbursements. For multi-year commitments, the sum of the grant is counted in the year in which it was awarded. For example, a two-year grant for $100,000 awarded in 2015 would be credited as a $100,000 grant in 2015 as opposed to a $50,000 grant in 2015 and then another $50,000 grant in 2016.CURRENCIESAll figures are reported in U.S. dollars. When data was provided in another currency, grant amounts were converted to U.S. dollars based on the conversion rate at the midpoint of the year in which the grant was awarded.RE-GRANTINGDue to the complex network of funding structures and the relationship of donors, intermediaries, governments, and multilaterals, this report tracks funds awarded for the purposes of re-granting and eliminates double-counting where appropriate. Specifically, when we receive information regarding (1) a grant awarded to an intermediary for re-granting, and (2) the grants ultimately awarded by the intermediary, then only the latter set of grants are included in most tabulations and charts. The exception is that we have included all re-granting dollars in all top funder lists as well as in the appendix to accurately show the overall level of LGBTQ funding provided by each grantmaker, regardless of whether those dollars are provided in the form of direct grants or through an intermediary that then re-grants those dollars to other organizations and individuals. As a result, the top funder charts in this report do “double-count” re-granting when aggregated. NOTE: This report methodology was devised in close collaboration with the 2015-2016 Global Resources Report Advisory Committee. For a full list of committee members please see the acknowledgements page at the end of the report. 8 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe Big PictureOverview of Global LGBTI FundingTOTAL FUNDINGIn the two-year period of 2015-2016, institutional funding for LGBTI issues globally totaled approximately $524 million.2 Over these two years, a total of 511 foundations and 15 government and multilateral agencies awarded more than 12,964 grants for LGBTI issues around the world. Of the $524 million total, approximately $275 million was awarded in 2015 and $249 million was awarded in 2016.Drawing\t on\t the\t data\t in\t this\t report,\t as\t well\t as\t the\t first\tedition covering calendar years 2013 and 2014, we now have four years of data on global LGBTI funding. Between the 2013-2014 reporting period and the 2015-2016 reporting period, global LGBTI funding grew by $100 million, or 23 percent.SCOPE AND CONTEXT OF REPORTThis report provides an overview of institutional funding for LGBTI issues around the world. It captures data on funding from foundations, intermediaries, corporations, government agencies, and multilateral agencies, but does not include individual donors. It covers funding provided by these institutions in calendar years 2015 and 2016 for LGBTI-focused organizations\tand\t for\tprojects\t that\tspecifically\t focus\ton\tLGBTI\tcommunities.\tNotably, the 2015-2016 edition of the Global Resources Report includes a 35% increase in reported grants, from 9,632 in 2013-2014 to 12,964 in 2015-2016.

In particular, over the course of both the 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 reports, the U.S. Government, one of the top funders of LGBTQ issues, has only provided data on its LGBTI funding for one year, calendar year 2014. In that year, the U.S. Government provided more than $15 million in LGBTI funding, including nearly $4 million awarded through the Global Equality Fund it administers. This incomplete data reporting from the U.S. Government contributes to the sharp spike in LGBTI funding reported for 2014. In order to provide as accurate a picture as possible of the overall trajectory of global LGBTI funding, the chart above shows the trendline of total LGBTI funding both including and excluding 2014 funding reported by the U.S. Government.Despite the recent growth of LGBTI funding, it remains small and has not grown in proportion to overall foundation funding and international aid. Over the two-year period of 2015-2016, North American and European foundations awarded a total of $242.8 billion. During that same period, this\treport\tfinds\tthat\tfoundations\tawarded\t$421.2\tmillion\tspecifically\t for\t LGBTI\t issues.\t In\t other\t words,\t for\t every\t$100 that foundations gave only about 17 cents explicitly focused on LGBTI communities.3 According to the Organization for Economic and Co-Operation and Development (OECD), international development assistance funding totaled nearly $131.6 billion in 2015 and more than $142.6 billion in 2016, for a combined total of $274.2 billion. For the same two-year period,\tthis\treport\tfinds\tthat\tgovernment\tand\tmultilateral\tagencies\t awarded\t about\t $102.7\t million\t specifically\tfor LGBTI issues. In other words, for every $100 of international aid and assistance, less than four cents explicitly focused on LGBTI issues.LGBTI FUNDING COMPARED TO OVERALL FUNDINGFOUNDATION FUNDING$0.17 PER$100.00GOVERNMENT FUNDING$0.04 PER$100.00______________________________________________________________________________3 Figures for foundation funding in the United States are drawn from the Giving USA 2016: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2015 and Giving USA 2017: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2016, both available at givingusa.org.

Funding for LGBTI Issues in the Global North: This section provides an analysis of funding for two major world regions: (1) the United States and Canada and (2) Western Europe. 3. Funding for International LGBTI Issues: This section provides an analysis of funding focused on LGBTI issues at the international level, such as advocacy for the inclusion of LGBTI issues in international bodies and instruments, or work to strengthen the capacity of LGBTI movements across multiple regions of the world.During 2015 and 2016, about $126 million, or 24 percent of all funding for LGBTI issues, was focused on serving or advocating for LGBTI communities in the Global South and East.

Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa saw increases in funding, while funding for the Middle East and North Africa maintained at the same levels.In the same period, about $325 million, or 62 percent of all funding for LGBTI issues, was focused on serving or advocating for LGBTI communities in the Global North. The United States received $287 million—nearly all of it from foundations and corporations based in the US. Of the remainder, $38 million focused on LGBTI communities in Western Europe, and $1 million focused on Canada. Funding for the Global North increased by $84 million compared to the two-year period of 2013-2014, a 35-percent increase. About one-third of the increase ($29 million) was the result of philanthropic grants specifically\tdevoted\tto\tsurvivors\tand\tfamilies\tof\tthe\tvictims\tof\tthe Pulse massacre in Orlando, Florida. The remaining $72 million of funding focused on LGBTI issues at the international or global level. Much of this work was done by international advocacy organizations, such as ILGA, Council for Global Equality, OutRight Action International, and Human Rights Watch for work at the global level. Funding for work at the international level grew by $17.3 million compared to 2013-2014. This represents a 31-percent increase, the sharpest growth seen in any geographic category for this reporting period.Nearly all of the organizations receiving funding for international LGBTI rights are located in the Global North, and some Global North organizations also receive funding to advance LGBTI rights in the Global South and East. $100,000,000$50,000,000$0$150,000,000$200,000,000$250,000,000$300,000,000Asia &The PacificEasternEurope, Central Asia, and RussiaLatin America & The CaribbeanMiddle East & North AfricaWestern EuropeSub-SaharanAfrica Canada &the UnitedStates’13-14’15-16’13-14’15-16 ’13-14’15-16’13-14 ’15-16’13-14’15-16’13-14’15-16’13-14’15-16Sub - Saharan Africa$53,945,239Middle East and North Africa $6,735,108Eastern Europe,Central Asia,and Russia$19,336,445 Asia $22,276,746International$72,770,568 Latin Americaand The Caribbean $24,164,704Western Europe$37,510,193 1 coin =  $ 1 millionand The PacificCanada andthe United States$287,297,532MAP OF LGBTI FUNDING, BY REGIONAL FOCUS (2015-2016)12 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesSub - Saharan Africa$53,945,239Middle East and North Africa $6,735,108Eastern Europe,Central Asia,and Russia$19,336,445 Asia $22,276,746International$72,770,568 Latin Americaand The Caribbean $24,164,704Western Europe$37,510,193 1 coin =  $ 1 millionand The PacificCanada andthe United States$287,297,532MAP OF LGBTI FUNDING, BY REGIONAL FOCUS (2015-2016)Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities1314 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesThe top 10 foundation funders of LGBTI issues awarded $176.8 million, or 34 percent of all LGBTI funding.

While some government funders submitted consolidated grants data for all their agencies, in some cases government agencies individually submit data on their LGBTI grants, which may result in an underrepresentation of those countries’ overall LGBTI funding if the full range of relevant agencies did not participate. Applicable HIV/AIDS-related funding from governments and multilateral agencies was included in this report. While some of that funding was considered too broadly focused for inclusion, the report does include HIV funding targeting LGBTI and MSM communities. In particular, over $5 million of the World Bank’s reported total funding was for HIV prevention programming targeting men who have sex with men (msm). If this funding were excluded, the World Bank would not appear on the list of top government and multilateral donors.Over the two-year period of 2015-2016, over 1,000 nongovernmental organizations, nonprofit agencies, and other civil society organizations received funding for LGBTI work focused outside of the United States. The top twenty grant recipients received nearly 36 percent of the funding. The list includes five organizations based in the Global South and East - one less than was featured on the list during the last reporting cycle.Top Recipients of LGBTI FundingTOP 10 GOVERNMENT AND MULTILATERAL FUNDERS OF INTERNATIONAL AID FOR LGBTI ISSUES,BY TOTAL AMOUNT (2015-2016)1 Government of The Netherlands — The Hague, The Netherlands $37,827,9952 Government of Sweden —Stockholm, Sweden $29,368,1133 Global Equality Fund — Washington, D.C., United States $10,871,3844 European Commission — Brussels, Belgium $10,619,1885 Government of Denmark — Copenhagen, Denmark $6,202,0536 World Bank — Washington, D.C., United States $5,750,8907 Government of Norway — Oslo, Norway $4,682,7868 EEA AND NORWAY GRANTS (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) — Oslo, Norway $2,977,8069 Government of Finland — Helsinki, Finland $2,456,69310 Government of Canada - Ottawa, Canada $1,602,899NOTE: Three governments reported domestic funding for LGBTI issues, in addition to the international aid presented in the table above.

If the German Government’s domestic grantmaking were included in the above table, it would appear as the third largest government or  multilateral funder of LGBTI issues.

However, as with any research effort, there are gaps in the data available and therefore reported in this edition of the Global Resources Report. There are several funders that we know have awarded LGBTI grants, but whose data are not fully included in this report. Most of the grants data analyzed in this report are collected directly from the funders awarding the grant. In some cases, when we are unable to attain grants data directly from a funding entity, we attain it from other public documents, such as annual reports and online grants databases. In the case of U.S.-based private foundations and public charities, we also examine annual tax return documents, which are required to include a list of grants awarded. In cases where funders did not report data directly to us, and no other reliable public documentation of their grantmaking was available, we were unable to include their grants data in this report. This is most often the case with funding entities that are not required to release public documentation of their grantmaking, such as government agencies or corporations that award grants directly (rather than through an affiliated foundation).In terms of the total grant amount, the most notable gap in this edition of the Global Resources Report is the lack of data from the U.S. Government and incomplete data on grants awarded through the Global Equality Fund. The Global Equality Fund is a pooled fund focused on advancing LGBTI rights around the world, housed at the U.S. Department of State. The fund receives contributions not only from the U.S. government, but also from several other government agencies in Europe and Latin America, as well as from private foundations and corporations. Over the four years of grants data captured in the first two editions of the Global Resources Report, the U.S. Government and the Global Equality Fund have only provided data for one year: 2014, which was included in the first edition of the report. In that year, the U.S. Government awarded $11.1 million in grants focused on LGBTI communities, plus an additional $7.6 million in funds raised and awarded through the Global Equality Fund. In addition, we have attained and included some data on grantmaking by the Global Equality Fund, based on the Fund’s 2015 annual report, which was publicly released in June of 2016 and reported $10.9 million in grants awarded that year. Unfortunately, no similar report has been released for 2016, and so only one year of Global Equality Fund’s grantmaking is included in this edition of the Global Resources Report.BEHIND THE NUMBERS What Funders Are Missing from This Report?20 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesIf the U.S. Government has continued to provide LGBTI funding at a similar level in 2015-2016, and the Global Equality Fund continued to award grants at a similar level in 2016, then that would constitute approximately $29-34 million in missing grants data, or about six percent of the total grant amount reported on over the two-year period of the report. This gap is even more prominent in LGBTI funding for the Global South and East, which is where the majority of documented U.S. Government and Global Equality Funding have been devoted. With reported funding for the Global South and East totaling $126.5 million in 2015-2016, it is likely that adding the full amount of funding from the U.S. Government and the Global Equality Fund would increase that total by 15-20 percent.Several other notable LGBTI funders are missing from this edition of the report. The Government of the United Kingdom, which reported $5.2 million in LGBTI grants for the first report, was unable to provide detailed data for the second edition. The United Nations Development Program, which receives funding for its LGBTI grantmaking, also is not included in this edition. However, several government and multilateral agencies have contributed grants data to the report for the first time in this edition: the governments of Canada and Denmark reported on their grantmaking for the first time, as did the World Bank. Overall, this report includes 50 more funders than the first edition did, pointing to increasingly comprehensive and accurate documentation of global LGBTI funding data.This report makes a number of comparisons to the data from the 2013-2014 report, so as to allow for an analysis of trend lines over the time. Generally, in presenting these trend lines, we include all data available from both reports. However, the case of the U.S. Government and the Global Equality Fund is unique, since the scale of grantmaking is so large in comparison to the total and since we only have data on a single year in the case of the U.S. and only two years in the case of the Global Equality Fund. Including these irregular data points creates a skewed picture of fluctuations in funding that are, in fact, only fluctuations in reported funding, not in the actual funds awarded that year. In order to present the most accurate and useful picture possible, where relevant, we have reported on grantmaking totals both including and excluding funding from the Global Equality Fund and the U.S. Government.These challenges of analyzing incomplete data highlight the importance of consistent and transparent reporting, which we hope will continue to become the commonly held best practice in the field of LGBTI grantmaking.NOTE: While most reporting governments only shared data on international aid for LGBTI issues, three governments – Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden - also reported in-country grantmaking for LGBTI issues. While this domestic funding was included in the overall calculations in this report, it was removed from the top government and multilateral donor list on page 17 and is addressed in notes throughout the report where relevant.Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities21Sources of Global LGBTI FundingExcluding funding for the United States, 44 percent of LGBTI funding came from governments and multilateral agencies. Public foundations and intermediaries awarded 26 percent, private foundations awarded 17 percent, and corporations awarded 4 percent of global LGBTI funding.NOTE: In contrast to other sections of this report, this chart includes re-granting, so as to capture the full amount of LGBTI funding  flowing from (or through) each type of funder.NOTE: The other types of funding tracked included capital support, endowment support, matching grants, scholarships, seed funding,  sponsorships, and prizes.SOURCES OF LGBTI FUNDING, BY FUNDER TYPE (2013-2016)Excluding funding focused on the United StatesType of SupportThe majority of global LGBTI funding – 67 percent – was awarded in the form of program support. General operating support accounted for 26 percent of all global LGBTI funding, increasing from 20 percent in 2013-2014. Capacity-building support was the only other form of support to total more than 1 percent of funding, accounting for over $11 million in LGBTI funding outside the United States.DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING, BY TYPE OF SUPPORT (2013-2016)Excluding funding focused on the United StatesCorporate Funders$10,574,005Corporate Funders$9,908,0724% 4%Anonymous Donors$16,326,056Anonymous Donors$10,897,3506% 5%Private Foundations $48,535,968Private Foundations$59,009,52417% 24%Public Foundations & Intermediaries$30,834,339Public Foundations & Intermediaries$72,600,21513%26%Government & Multilateral Agencies$128,890,052Government & Multilateral Agencies$131,336,35246% 54%Program Support$161,583,180 67%Other Support$2,796,0921%Capacity Building Support$11,522,6095%General Operating Support$62,212,59926%2015-16 2013-14Program Support$161,666,155 78%Other Support$1,663,0281%Capacity Building Support$3,484,6602%General Operating Support$40,874,15520%2015-16 2013-1422 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesIssues FundedOver the two-year period of 2015 and 2016, $238 million was awarded to LGBTI issues outside the United States. Human Rights was the highest funded issue area, receiving $135.3 million, or 57 percent, of this funding. Health and Wellbeing received over 50 million - of which 87 percent was for HIV/AIDS. Funding to Strengthen Community, Families and Visibility received over $16 million, or 7 percent of the total, while organizations working on Economic Issues, Education and Safe Schools Issues, and addressing Violence, Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia each received less than 5 percent of the total funding. Ten percent of LGBTI funding was for Other Issues, largely because the details of these grants were not reported in order to maintain the anonymity and safety of the organizations receiving funding.DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL LGBTI FUNDING, BY ISSUE ADDRESSED (2013-2016)Excluding funding focused on the United StatesHuman Rights$135,313,71257%Health & Wellbeing$51,944,67822%Other Issues$23,455,19110%Strengthening Communities, Families, & Visibility $16,539,2017%Economic Issues$1,841,2921%Education & Safe Schools$1,132,265<1%Confronting Violence, Homophobia, Biphobia, &Transphobia $7,888,0403%Human Rights$102,790,58949%Health & Wellbeing$47,145,29322%Other Issues$23,224,56711%Strengthening Communities, Families, & Visibility $18,190,3657%Economic Issues$2,855,4131%Education & Safe Schools$4,089,2932%Confronting Violence, Homophobia, Biphobia, & Transphobia $9,392,4765%2015-162013-14Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities23HUMAN RIGHTS $135,313,712 57% $102,790,589 49%Challenging Anti-LGBTI Laws $1,936,094 1% $3,781,338 3%Decriminalization and Criminal Justice Reform $216,797 <1% $881,344 <1%Gender Identity Protections  $9,561,135 4% $3,789,866 2%Human Rights (General) $111,430,912 46% $84,599,476 41%Marriage/Civil Unions $365,506 <1% $474,187 Migration and Refugee Issues  $1,920,300 1% $429,642 <1%Military Inclusion  $11,154 <1% - -Nondiscrimination Protections  $1,600,557 1% $1,594,974 1%Sex Worker Rights $511,342 <1% -Sexual and Reproductive Rights/Justice  $7,915,589 3% $5,018,632 2%HEALTH AND WELLBEING  $51,944,678 22% $47,145,293 23%Cultural Competence and Data Collection  $672,377 <1% $1,409,468 1%General Health Services and Health Promotion  $3,599,967 2% $2,164,640 1%HIV/AIDS  $45,439,436 19% $36,641,292 18%Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Suicide Prevention  $1,999,465 1% $1,995,509 1%Sexual and Reproductive Health  $233,432 <1% $4,934,384 2%STRENGTHENING COMMUNITIES,  FAMILIES,  & VISIBILITY $16,539,201 7% $18,190,365 9%Community Building and Empowerment $6,250,362 3% $8,959,838 4%Religion $4,201,714 2% $3,076,845 3%Sports $330,901 <1% - -Strengthening Families $1,865,352 1% $576,268 <1%Visibility $3,890,873 2% $5,577,413 3%CONFRONTING VIOLENCE,  HOMOPHOBIA,  BIPHOBIA,  & TRANSPHOBIA $7,888,040 3% $9,392,476 5%Anti-Violence $2,687,976 1% $3,437,581 2%Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia $5,200,063 2% $5,954,894 3%ECONOMIC ISSUES  $1,841,292 1% $2,855,413 1%Food Security - - $20,200 <1%Housing and Homelessness $1,040,603 <1% $209,670 <1%Labor and Employment $800,690 <1% $2,625,543 1%EDUCATION & SAFE SCHOOLS $1,132,365 <1% $4,089,293 2%Education $523,003 <1% $3,127,430 2%Safe Schools $609,362 <1% $961,863 <1%OTHER ISSUES $23,455,191 10% $23,224,567 11%Multi-Issue $8,724,865 4% $9,278,112 4%Philanthropy $2,559,054 1% $2,307,502 1%Unspecified $12,171,272 5% $11,634,855 6%GRAND TOTAL $238,114,480 $207,687,9972015-16 2013-14DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF ISSUES FUNDED IN LGBTI FUNDING (2013-2016)24 Global Resources ReportGovernment and Philanthropic Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex CommunitiesStrategies FundedOver the two-year period of 2015 and 2016, $235.8 million was awarded to organizations advancing various strategies to serve and empower LGBTI communities outside the United States. Advocacy, Community Organizing, and Public Education was the top funded strategy, receiving $92 million, or 39 percent, of LGBTI funding outside the US.

The sharp increase for public foundations and intermediaries is in part due to giving related to the Orlando tragedy.

    "abstract": "Funders for LGBTQ Issues and Global Philanthropy Project are pleased to share with you The 2015-2016 Global Resources Report: Philanthropic & Government Support for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Communities, the most comprehensive report to date on the state of foundation and government funding for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) issues. This report captures data on 12,964 grants awarded by 511 foundations, intermediaries, and corporations and by 15 government and multilateral agencies over the two-year period of 2015-2016. It builds upon the first edition of the Global Resources Report, which was released two years ago and focused on grantmaking in the calendar years 2013-2014. With this second volume, we now have comprehensive data on four calendar years of grantmaking, allowing us to conduct a deeper analysis of the trendlines for LGBTI funding over time. In several sections of this report, we offer not only a snapshot of funding for 2015-2016, but also an analysis of how funding has shifted over a four-year period.",
