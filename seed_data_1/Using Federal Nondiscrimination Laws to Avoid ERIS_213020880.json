This Article provides advocates with alternative legal arguments to help employees bring claims when their employer provides a health benefit plan that discriminates on the basis of gender identity. These arguments can avoid the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s broad preemption scheme and lack of nondiscrimination provisions. This Article proposes that, based on a narrow exception to preemption regarding the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s construction with other federal laws and the case law interpreting that exception, federal nondiscrimination laws — including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act — may and must play a role in regulating discrimination on the basis of gender identity in employee health benefit plans.

CONCLUSION ...............................................................................................................63 I. INTRODUCTION One of the most important laws for transgender people in America today may be the Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act (“Affordable Care Act”). The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, which — as of December 2018 — includes gender identity and transgender status, by most insurance companies and health care providers in the United States.2 More specifically, the Affordable Care Act prevents insurance providers in every state from categorically excluding or denying coverage for gender-affirming healthcare, such as surgical procedures or hormone replacement therapies.3 However, this interpretation of the rule is currently enjoined. However, with recent attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act4 and a potential agency rule that would interpret the Affordable Care Act’s sex discrimination provision to exclude protections for transgender people by defining sex biologically,5 transgender people are at risk of being denied services and coverage. Therefore, legal advocates who work with the transgender community need to make innovative legal arguments to ensure protection for their clients. If or when the Affordable Care Act or its implementing rules are repealed or undermined, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) will play the premiere role in regulating employee health benefit plans.

Schaaff Final Article 3.0 (Do Not Delete) 12/15/2018  4:04 PM  USING FEDERAL NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS TO AVOID ERISA 47 ERISA does not contain a sex nondiscrimination provision that could protect employees from discrimination in health services or plans on the basis of gender identity. But based on a narrow exception to ERISA’s broad preemption scheme and several federal courts’ interpretations of that exception, federal nondiscrimination laws that protect transgender individuals from employment discrimination can help ensure coverage of gender-affirming care in employee health plans. Part II of this Article will explain the core terms and concepts related to gender identity and protections afforded to transgender and non-binary individuals under the Affordable Care Act. It will also introduce an alternative legal strategy to assist transgender individuals seeking coverage if the Affordable Care Act’s protections are undermined. Part III will explain the nondiscrimination provisions of ERISA and will explain how federal nondiscrimination laws can overcome ERISA’s broad governance of health benefit plans in the United States. It will argue, based on the text of the statute and case law interpreting ERISA, that federal nondiscrimination laws should regulate discrimination in employee health benefit plans despite ERISA’s broad preemption scheme. Finally, Part IV will provide a legal overview of how federal nondiscrimination laws can protect transgender employees’ access to gender-affirming care. The Article will conclude by recommending the best jurisdictions in which to bring these claims. II. BACKGROUND A.    Transgender 101 & Healthcare Overview Necessary to framing this discussion is an overview of key terminology and of healthcare services that some transgender people may seek. First, “gender identity” is “[a]n individual’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else.”6 Second, “transgender” is “[a] term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned [or designated] sex at birth.”7 “Transgender is a broad term”8 and is sometimes used by persons who are non-binary or gender non-conforming.9 Third, “non-binary” is a commonly used term for “[p]eople whose gender is not [exclusively] male or female.”10 Finally, some transgender or non-binary people   6.

A majority of states still provide no protections for transgender people seeking gender-affirming care.38 But because of the Section 1557 regulations, many insurers removed categorical transgender care exclusions.39 After the regulation was finalized, eight states and three religious medical groups challenged the statutory interpretation of Section 1557 and requested a declaratory judgment of invalidity under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.40 The District Judge granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the enforcement of the regulations nationwide.41 Under the Chevron two-step analysis,42 the judge reasoned that because Congress clearly meant “sex” to mean only “biological sex,” Chevron deference did not apply, and HHS did not have the “authority to interpret such a significant policy decision.”43 Following the decision, the Department of Justice, representing HHS, chose not to appeal the decision and instead asked the court for a remand so that HHS could determine the validity of the regulations.44 The judge granted the remand.45 In August 2017, the Department of Justice announced that it was reviewing a draft of a proposed rule prepared by HHS regarding Section 1557.46 The Office of   35.

C.    An Alternative Path Toward Protections for Transgender Employees With a possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a rollback of its implementing regulations looming, ERISA may predominantly govern nondiscrimination in healthcare. However, ERISA itself contains limited nondiscrimination provisions. Therefore, advocates will have to use more protective federal laws, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), to protect access to medically necessary gender-affirming care for transgender employees, free from discrimination on the basis of their identity. III. OVERCOMING THE PROBLEM OF ERISA A.     ERISA and Nondiscrimination The Employee Retirement Income Security Act is a federal law that sets “minimum standards” for most health benefits plans in the private sector to protect individuals obtaining health insurance through their employer.51 Though ERISA’s “minimum standards” did not historically contain any nondiscrimination provisions, more recent amendments to the law have expanded the protections available to covered employees.52 However, these amendments provide limited   47.

The passage of multiple nondiscrimination provisions of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (“MHPAEA”), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), and the Affordable Care Act have made ERISA’s nondiscrimination protections more robust, but they are ultimately unhelpful to transgender or non-binary employees. For example, the MHPAEA amendments to ERISA, or ERISA § 1185(a) Parity in mental health and substance use disorder benefits, requires mental health care to be treated equally to physical or surgical care.53 This amendment may be helpful for transgender individuals in seeking mental health services to secure letters of referral;54 however, once a person is seeking hormone therapy, surgeries, or both, ERISA § 1185(a)’s nondiscrimination protections no longer apply. HIPAA amended ERISA to prohibit discrimination against individual participants and beneficiaries based on certain health factors such as health status, medical condition, and disability.55 These nondiscrimination protections apply only to enrollment eligibility in an employee benefit plan;56 they do not apply to benefits or exclusions.57 Further, neither ERISA, HIPAA, nor the statute’s implementing regulations, define the terms health status, medical condition, and disability,58 so it is unclear whether transgender people would be protected from discrimination in plan enrollment under the HIPAA amendments to ERISA. The “Affordable Care Act amended ERISA to incorporate several health coverage market reforms,”59 but did not include the nondiscrimination components of Section 1557. The closest provision is a nondiscrimination provision for “health status.”60 Therefore, it is again unclear whether transgender people are protected from discrimination under ERISA. In sum, the nondiscrimination provisions now within ERISA are not enough to protect individuals seeking coverage for gender-affirming care. Therefore, advocates must next look to the laws that provide broader protection from discrimination in the privileges of employment —Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  health-plans/erisa (last visited Nov. 4, 2018).  53.

ERISA’s Relationship to Federal Nondiscrimination Laws Congress intended ERISA to be the exclusive law governing employee benefits plans,61  meaning that it preempts both state and other federal laws on that subject. Nevertheless, Title VII and the ADA should still provide nondiscrimination protections applicable to transgender employees in the provision of health benefits plans despite ERISA’s broad preemption scheme. Title VII prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex with respect to “terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”62 Similarly, the ADA prohibits “discrimination against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to . . . terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.”63 The Supreme Court has held that employee retirement plans that discriminate on the basis of sex are benefits of employment governed by Title VII.64 Additionally, two recent federal district court decisions held that denial or exclusion of gender-affirming care in a health benefits plan is sex discrimination, implying that — like retirement plans — an employee health benefit plan is a privilege, or benefit, of employment.65 In Baker v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., the Northern District Court of Texas held that a transgender employee could bring a Title VII claim against her employer because she “plausibly allege[d] that she was denied employment benefits based on her sex”66 when she was denied coverage for gender-affirming surgery.67 The employee brought three claims against her employer and the administrator of the health plan: one for gender identity discrimination in violation of Section 1557 of the ACA, one for wrongful denial of benefits under ERISA, and one for sex discrimination in violation of Title VII.68 The court dismissed the plaintiff’s ACA claim for failure to state a cause of action — at the time the plaintiff brought the action, HHS’s interpretation of Section 1557’s sex discrimination provision was merely a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.69 Similarly, the court dismissed   61.

However, it implied such by finding plausible the plaintiff’s assertions that her employer “engaged in intentional gender discrimination in the terms and conditions of [her] employment by denying her a medically necessary procedure based solely on her gender [was] conduct that constitutes a . . . violation of Title VII . . . [that] caused [her] to suffer the loss of pay, benefits, and prestige.”72 Similarly, in Boyden v. Conlin, the Western District Court of Wisconsin held that a state health insurance coverage exclusion of gender-affirming care constituted sex discrimination under Title VII.73 In that case, transgender state employees challenged the insurance exclusions under Title VII, the Affordable Care Act, and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.74 Under both Title VII and the Affordable Care Act, the court held that the exclusions were a “straightforward case of sex discrimination”75 and that “[e]mployee-sponsored benefits, like the health insurance at issue in this case, are part of an employee’s wages and benefits for purposes of asserting an nondiscrimination claim.”76 As these cases demonstrate, federal nondiscrimination laws can govern discrimination in health benefits plans. Arguably, a statutory exception to ERISA’s broad preemption scheme allows for such. ERISA § 1144(d), or § 514(d), provides that the law does not “alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair or supersede any law of the United States . . . or any rule or regulation issued under any such law.”77 Federal courts have interpreted this provision to mean that ERISA does not preempt federal nondiscrimination laws.78 The Supreme Court has implied as much by holding that ERISA does not preempt certain state laws that provide a means of enforcing commands of respective federal laws — including federal nondiscrimination laws.79   70.

Delta Airlines, the Supreme Court suggested that state nondiscrimination laws may avoid ERISA preemption if they “play a significant role in the enforcement of” federal nondiscrimination laws.80 Specifically, the Court considered whether ERISA would preempt New York’s Human Rights Law, which extended employment protections to pregnant workers.81 The Court reasoned that based on ERISA § 1144(d), or § 514(d), ERISA should not preempt state laws that contribute to the enforcement of federal laws.82 In its analysis, the Court explicitly acknowledged the “joint state/federal enforcement” scheme of Title VII: when an employment practice unlawful under Title VII occurs in a state that also prohibits that practice, “the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’) refers the charges to the state agency,” and “the EEOC [itself] may not actively process the charges” until the state proceedings have begun.83 Therefore, preemption of a state nondiscrimination law, which prohibits conduct also unlawful under the federal nondiscrimination law, would “frustrate the goal of encouraging joint state/federal enforcement of Title VII[,]” thereby impairing federal law, in violation of ERISA Section 514(d).84 In other words, certain state laws, to the extent that they are analogous to or further the enforcement of federal laws, are not preempted by ERISA. This holding allows federal nondiscrimination laws and state laws that mirror them to operate despite ERISA’s broad preemption scheme. If ERISA were intended to be the only law governing employee benefits plans, this analysis would be impossible — state nondiscrimination laws would certainly not have a place in governing employee health benefits plans if federal nondiscrimination laws like Title VII and the ADA were not intended to do so. Thus, Title VII and the ADA can govern employee health benefits plans despite ERISA’s broad preemption scheme. As such, transgender individuals seeking protections from nondiscrimination in employee benefits plans can bring legal claims despite ERISA’s lack of nondiscrimination protections, particularly in jurisdictions that both recognize this exception to ERISA and interpret federal civil rights laws to protect people from gender identity or gender dysphoria discrimination in employment, under either Title VII or the ADA, respectively.

However, several federal courts, including the First, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, have held that prohibitions on sex discrimination—including Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination—encompass discrimination on the basis of gender identity.88 Administrative and political shifts have made transgender employment protections even more uncertain. In April 2012, the EEOC first held that “discrimination against a transgender individual because of her gender-nonconformity is sex discrimination.”89 In 2014, President Obama issued Executive Order 13672, which prohibited discrimination based on gender identity in federal employment and government contracting.90 In 2016, the EEOC announced that it “interprets and enforces Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination as forbidding any employment discrimination based on gender identity.”91 The EEOC has “reiterated these positions through recent amicus curiae briefs and litigation”92 and its Strategic Enforcement Plans.93 As of December 2018, the EEOC has   85.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a)(1) (2012).  86.

Those who suffer from the condition surely endure great mental and emotional agony.”106 Gender dysphoria can “substantially [limit] . . .  major life activities [such as] interacting with others, reproducing, and social and occupational functioning.”107 In some instances, this distress can be alleviated through living and being respected as one’s true gender, undergoing hormone therapies and surgical treatments, or participating in counseling.108  In a major victory for transgender people, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania became the first federal court to rule that gender dysphoria is a protected condition under the ADA.109 In Blatt v.

But under the alternative, narrower interpretation of the term, this anomaly would be resolved, as the term gender identity disorders would belong to the first category described above.113 Deciding “to interpret the term gender identity disorders narrowly to refer to simply the condition of identifying with a different gender,” the court concluded that this interpretation does not “exclude from ADA coverage disabling conditions that persons who identify with a different gender may have — such as Blatt’s gender dysphoria, which substantially limits her major life activities of interacting with others, reproducing, and social and occupational functioning.”114 Thus, the court held that gender dysphoria was not excluded from the ADA’s definition of disability under § 12211.115 The court’s ruling in Blatt allows transgender or non-binary people with gender dysphoria to assert valid ADA discrimination claims within that jurisdiction. Further, it opens the door for other federal courts to interpret the ADA similarly and could allow transgender or non-binary employees with gender dysphoria to bring claims of discrimination in the provision of employee health benefits plans.

Transportation Communications International Union, the defendant-employer amended its “welfare-benefit plan provided to retired employees . . . to require the retirees to pay $100 per month for their medical benefits” and left active employee benefits alone.118 The plaintiff-retirees claimed that this change violated the New York Human Rights Law’s prohibition on age discrimination.119 Because the state law protections mirrored those of the federal nondiscrimination law, ERISA did not preempt the state law age discrimination claims.120 In 2000, the First Circuit Court of Appeals stated that state law claims that target conduct unlawful under the ADA “would be exempt from ERISA preemption.”121 In Tompkins v. United Healthcare of New England Inc., the parents of the child with a chromosomal disease, who received insurance through their employer, were denied coverage for the treatment of the child.122 The parents sued the insurance company, claiming that the denial of benefits for the treatment of their child violated the ADA and state nondiscrimination laws123 and that the state laws were part of the ADA’s enforcement scheme.124 The First Circuit held that because federal laws like the ADA and Title VII “contemplate[]” that “state laws will contribute to the overall federal enforcement regime,” state law claims are    exempt from ERISA preemption when those state laws address conduct unlawful under federal nondiscrimination laws.125 In 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that ERISA preempted a   116.  The Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have not used the principles of Shaw to save state nondiscrimination laws from ERISA preemption, but instead have used Shaw to save from ERISA preemption state laws that further the enforcement of federal bankruptcy law. See In re Schlein, 8 F.3d 745, 751–54 (11th Cir. 1993) (holding that ERISA does not preempt “state law pension plan exemptions relied upon by debtors in federal bankruptcy cases.”); see also In re Vickers, 954 F.2d 1426, 1429 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding “that ERISA does not preempt the Missouri exemption statute [that] permits debtors to exempt reasonably necessary pension benefits.”); In re Dyke, 943 F.2d 1435, 1450 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that ERISA did not preempt Texas law enforcing the federal Bankruptcy Code). The Tenth Circuit has considered applying this exception to rulings by state agencies. See Nat’l Elevator Indus., Inc. v. Calhoon, 957 F.2d 1555, 1557 (10th Cir. 1992). The Third, Fourth and Seventh Circuits have either not had the opportunity to address this issue or otherwise do not recognize this exemption.  117.  173 F.3d 94, 100 (2d Cir. 1999).  118.

Southern California Gas Co., the court reasoned that because the law outlawed conduct beyond what the ADEA covered, preemption of the state law would not “‘impair’ the joint state/federal enforcement scheme of the ADEA.”127 Thus, the court held that ERISA preempted the state law claim.128 In 2012, the Sixth Circuit held that ERISA did not preempt a state law claim that mirrored an ADEA claim.129 In Loffredo v. Daimler AG, former company executives were denied benefits under the company’s retirement plan when the company went bankrupt.130 The plaintiffs made several state law claims, including claims of age discrimination.131 The court reasoned that the plaintiff’s state-law age discrimination claim mirrored an ADEA claim, thus saving the state law claim from ERISA preemption.132 Federal district courts have also held that state statutory claims that target unlawful conduct under federal nondiscrimination laws are exempt from ERISA preemption.133 These decisions allow laws like Title VII and the ADA govern claims of discrimination in health benefits despite the broad preemption scheme of ERISA. Out of these circuit courts, all but the Second Circuit have allowed transgender plaintiffs to bring sex discrimination claims.134 Although the Second Circuit has yet to consider a claim of gender identity discrimination as sex discrimination, the court has held that sex discrimination under Title VII includes   126.

Ohio 2014) (interpreting Shaw to provide that “Section 514(a) will not preempt state antidiscrimination laws to the extent that they prohibit practices made unlawful by Title VII” and that “[c]laims brought under state statutes that would otherwise be preempted by ERISA remain fully enforceable to supplement ERISA to the extent that the state statutes track federal anti-discrimination law.”); James v. Fed. Res. Bank of N.Y., 471 F. Supp. 2d 226, 236 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (ruling that claims under the state law at issue were preempted to the extent that the law was not necessary to the enforcement of federal nondiscrimination laws); Jorgensen v.

Schaaff Final Article 3.0 (Do Not Delete) 12/15/2018  4:04 PM  USING FEDERAL NONDISCRIMINATION LAWS TO AVOID ERISA 63 discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.135  Further, at least two district courts within the Second Circuit have held that gender identity discrimination is sex discrimination.136 Together, these decisions could mean that employees may be successful in bringing discrimination claims in the Second Circuit’s jurisdiction against employers whose benefits plans discriminate on the basis of gender identity. In the meantime, because the First, Sixth, and Ninth circuits recognize gender identity discrimination as sex discrimination and recognize the Shaw exemption to ERISA preemption, transgender or non-binary employees in these jurisdictions will likely be successful in bringing Title VII sex discrimination claims for discrimination in a health benefits plan. As for ADA claims, the only court that has recognized gender dysphoria as a disability distinct from transgender status is a district court within the Third Circuit,137 and the Third Circuit has not considered the question of ERISA’s preemption of federal nondiscrimination laws. Nevertheless, the federal district court within the Third Circuit that recognized gender dysphoria as a disability under the ADA has done so.138 Therefore, at least in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, transgender or non-binary employees may be successful in bringing ADA disability discrimination claims for discrimination in a health benefits plan. Thus, if the Affordable Care Act or the regulations interpreting its nondiscrimination provisions to include gender identity are repealed, these jurisdictions are the best options for transgender or non-binary employees seeking coverage for gender-affirming care under their employee health benefits plans to bring claims. V. CONCLUSION Attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a potential rule that would interpret the Affordable Care Act’s sex discrimination provision to exclude protections for transgender people have put transgender people at risk of being denied gender-affirming care. If that happens, legal advocates will need to use Title VII and the Americans with Disabilities Act to overcome ERISA preemption. Otherwise, ERISA’s lack of nondiscrimination provisions will leave transgender employees without protection from discrimination in health benefit plans. Because of the Supreme Court’s decision in Shaw v. Delta Airlines and subsequent lower federal courts’ application of Shaw to save from ERISA preemption state nondiscrimination laws that mirror federal nondiscrimination laws, federal nondiscrimination laws play an important role in regulating discrimination in employee health benefits plans. Advocates will secure the best protections in jurisdictions that have held or implied that ERISA does not supersede other federal laws and that have also recognized protections for   135.  Zarda v.

This Article provides advocates with alternative legal arguments to help employees bring claims when their employer provides a health benefit plan that discriminates on the basis of gender identity. These arguments can avoid the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s broad preemption scheme and lack of nondiscrimination provisions. This Article proposes that, based on a narrow exception to preemption regarding the Employee Retirement Income Security Act’s construction with other federal laws and the case law interpreting that exception, federal nondiscrimination laws — including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act — may and must play a role in regulating discrimination on the basis of gender identity in employee health benefit plans",
