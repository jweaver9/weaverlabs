TikTok, Twitter, and Platform-SpecificTechnocultural Discourse in Responseto Taylor Swift’s LGBTQ+ Allyship in‘You Need to Calm Down’Melissa K. AvdeeffFor most of her career thus far, Taylor Swift’s cultural outputs have remained apolitical,often addressing heteronormative notions of romance, young adult life, and heartbreak.In 2019, Swift broke her politicised silence with ‘You Need to Calm Down’, a track whichself-proclaims the artist as an ally to LGBTQ+ communities through her co-option oflanguage historically used to silence marginalised voices, and the inclusion of LGBTQ+-identified celebrities in the accompanying music video. Through a criticaltechnocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) approach, and incorporating digitalethnography, this article examines and compares the multimodal response to ‘YouNeed to Calm Down’ on TikTok and Twitter. CTDA multimodal analysis is utilisedas a method to ascertain both the cultural situatedness of the track, its receptionthrough digital spaces, and also how that reception is connected to the conventions ofeach platform. Through an analysis of over 20,000 tweets utilising the#YouNeedToCalmDown hashtag, and over 100 TikTok videos based on the track, Iexamine platform-specific discourse: the de-politicised mimetic creativity of TikTok incomparison to the more hegemonic interpretations found on Twitter. Discussion isorganised around three themes of response to ‘You Need to Calm Down’: onlinecommunities and ambient affiliations, performative allyship, and cancel culture.Keywords: Twitter; TikTok; CTDA; LGBTQ+; ReceptionIntroductionIn 2019, after a thirteen-year career in which she largely remained apolitical in herpublic persona, even during accusations of white supremacist affiliations, TaylorSwift pronounced herself as an LGBTQ+ ally with ‘You Need to Calm Down’ (hen-ceforth YNTCD). This release is widely regarded as her first politically-motivatedContemporary Music Review, 2021https://doi.org/10.1080/07494467.2021.1945225© 2021 The Author(s).

But with a caveat that by depoliticisingthe message, it does not necessarily become neutral, but rather political, or represen-tational, in other ways. The reception is situated within a broader platform-specificfracturing of media reception which demonstrates the cultural affordances of plat-forms that have often been overlooked in social media research. In response, AndréBrock (2018) calls for an increased ‘critical cultural approach’ to new media technol-ogies through critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA), which this articleuses as a methodological starting point.By releasing YNTCD, Swift explores three themes in her work: her allyship towardsLGBTQ+ communities and pro-gay rights activism; the silencing attempts from heronline trolls; and a critique of the ways in which mainstreammedia pit women againsteach other, using her relationship with Katy Perry as an example. How these themeswere responded to on Twitter and TikTok varied, reflective of the conventions andaffordances of the platforms. While the mainstream press is not examined in detailin this article, much of their criticism and review is based on Twitter response, but,as will be outlined, the politicisation and critique of Swift’s allyship is often takenout of context. In addition, TikTok users engage less with the original themes ofthe song/music video, but instead rework the YNTCD ethos towards somethingmore universal, familiar, and at times tapping into a longer, and gendered, historyof ‘silencing’. Instead of an outright politicisation of Swift’s allyship, TikTok usersare seen to be layering culturally and historically embedded meanings over what, atfirst, appear to be quite mundane experiences.This article explores audience responses to Taylor Swift’s YNTCD through amixed-methods approach, drawing primarily from CTDA. It compares the discursiveand audiovisual reactions of users on Twitter and TikTok, examining how the plat-form ecologies inform audience participation. Through this exploration, Swift’sintended meanings surrounding allyship, pro-gay rights, and anti-women onwomen criticism, are found to be mirrored and amplified on Twitter, while TikTokpredominantly reinterprets these themes towards a more general, and often humor-ous, commentary on silencing within familiar relationships, and ecstatic sociability.CTDA calls for an examination of both the media text, and the media environments,or technologies, on which it is taken up, as well as of how audiences participate inculturally situated discourses surrounding a media text. Brock (2018) notes that,throughout the development of the field of social media research, apps and platformswere studied indiscriminately, centring the discourse over interface. With the fieldbeing more established, it is now necessary to look critically at the relationshipsbetween platform, culture, and ‘offline’ communities, identities, and practices.Within the YNTCD case study in particular, it could be argued that YNTCD functionsas a technology of engagement, mediating not only Swift’s meaning, but also theshared meanings of communities and affiliations.2 M. K. Avdeeff‘You Need to Calm Down’: Swift SpeaksOn June 14th, 2019, Taylor Swift released YNTCD as the second single for her seventhstudio album, Lover (2019). On June 17th, 2019, the accompanying music video wasreleased, following a series of video stills shared on her social media accounts. Accord-ing to media interviews which question Swift on her lyrics and audiovisual design,Swift’s intentions for the song and video were to position herself as an ally toLGBTQ+ communities, while also speaking out about negative online discourse,and the ways in which popular female entertainers are pitted against each other inthe press and social media.The origin story or urtext concerns Swift’s desire to ensure that her stance on socialjustice issues, and LGBTQ+ rights in particular, was made known to the public, as a‘coming out’ of her position as an ally. In an interview with Vogue (Aguirre 2019),when asked about her positionality, Swift responds:Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me,What wouldyou do if your son was gay?…‘The fact that he had to ask me… shocked me and made me realize that I had notmade my position clear enough or loud enough,’ she says. ‘If my son was gay, he’d begay. I don’t understand the question.’…If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ communitymight be thinking, she goes on. ‘It was kind of devastating to realize that Ihadn’t been publicly clear about that.She continues with a note about the thematic elements of YNTCD:‘The first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,’ she says. ‘The second verse isabout homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts. The thirdverse is about successful women being pitted against each other.’These themes are articulated in the lyrics, in which Swift challenges the ‘haters’ to‘calm down’ and to ‘just stop’. The YNTCD mantra becomes a blanket imperativefor anyone who expresses criticism towards LGBTQ+ communities/individuals, aswell as those who troll women online. Key lyrics include: ‘Why are you mad /When you could be GLAAD’; ‘We all know now, we all got crowns’; and ‘Shadenever made anybody less gay’.Aesthetically, the YNTCDmusic video is set in a pastel, colour-blocked trailer park,inhabited by Taylor Swift and various queer or ally-identified celebrities. These celeb-rities include drag queens dressed in the images of female singers who have ongoingassociations with queer communities, evoking simulacra of allyship in this aestheti-cized trailer park. While the video has faced criticisms of homonormativity (Lewis2019; Bennett 2014), it nevertheless does function as a noteworthy text of queer rep-resentation. In addition, the video features a group of ‘trailer trash’ protesters,Contemporary Music Review 3depicted in opposition to the hyper-colourful celebrities. This imagery has been cri-ticised in the mainstream press as a misguided representation of the poor and workingclass (Hubbs 2019; Lewis 2019), prompting Swift to clarify that it is intended to be apersonification of religious protesters:Meanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group thatpickets outside Swift’s concerts, not the white working class in general, as somehave assumed. ‘So many artists have them at their shows, and it’s such a con-founding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,’ shetells me. ‘Obviously I don’t want to mention the actual entity, because theywould get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities’.(Aguirre 2019)MethodologiesMethodologically, this study is grounded in Brock’s (2018) CTDA method, and builton a digital ethnography foundation. The use of CTDA is to respond to Brock’s callsto move away from ‘generalities’ of the internet ‘without unpacking the ideologicalcontent of those generalities’ (Brock 2018, 1019). In responding to the discourse ofSwift’s video, I also respond to the cultural context of where the discourse exists,and the affordances of each platform’s design. Brock lists two requirements forCTDA research: that the theoretical framework should ‘draw directly from the per-spectives of the group under examination’ (Brock 2018, 1017) and that critical tech-noculture is incorporated into said framework. CTDA examines culture astechnological artefact, and is a:critical cultural approach to the Internet and new media technologies, one thatinterrogates their material and semiotic complexities, framed by the extantoffline cultural and social practices its users engage in as they use these digital arte-facts. (Brock 2018, 1013)Brock notes that CTDA is intended as a response to technological determinism insocial media studies; but with the focus on the media ecology of social media, it never-theless does become a softly deterministic approach. In this work, I embrace a certaindegree of soft determinism in examining the influence that these interfaces and tech-nologies have on action and discourse. The interfaces give certain affordances, andmake possible actions and responses that are fundamental to the structure of the tech-nology. While unintended uses abound in various technologies, these unintendeduses are still mainly predetermined by the app functionality. By comparing theresponses on two social media platforms to a singular ‘event’ or media text, it islikely that, while some of the differences in response are indeed socio-cultural,some of these differences are going to be in response to app-specific conventions,as influenced by the parameters and functionality of the interface/platform. CTDAis largely concerned with online communities/cultures that also exist offline, but4 M. K. Avdeeffwe are also increasingly witnessing ‘cultures’ (in the widest sense of the term) formingand existing online, without adequate substantiation of whether these online commu-nities translate offline. For example, in TikTok in particular, ‘alt’ communities formaround offline communities, such as various LGBTQ+ groups, and also around moreobscure tastes, like ‘husky TikTok’, ‘cottage core TikTok’, and ‘dark academiaTikTok’. These alt communities are marked by their distinction from ‘straight’TikTok, which in itself is not only a marker of heteronormativity, but also in referenceto stereotypes of hegemonic conventions.CTDA, as a methodology, is quite prescriptive and not yet widely used, but itsapplication could extend to all aspects of internet use, and the communities thatcome together or form online. For example, Miriam Sweeney and Kelsea Whaley(2019) use CTDA to analyse the technocultural properties of emoji skin tones, con-necting the Unicode technical writing to cultural understandings of emojis and skincolour, and how these modifiers continue to centre whiteness. Apryl Williams’ (2017)CTDA work examines fat people of colour on Tumblr, and their counter-narratives tohegemonic depictions of thinness. Catherine Knight-Steele (2018) investigates howBlack blogger discourse challenges oppressive systems. And Rachel Kuo (2018) exam-ines the intersections of feminist and racial justice discourse through the Twitterhashtags, #NotYourAsianSideKick, and #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen. Brock,himself, originally used CTDA for research into racialised and marginalised groups,but notes that it can be extended to other ‘ism’ discourses and ideologies (2018;Sweeney and Brock 2013).The current research began with ongoing participant observation of both TikTokand Twitter as sites of public engagement with popular music texts and artists. Asthe commitment to undertake research on Swift’s YNTCD video reactionsemerged, such participant observation became more concerted, adopting a digitalethnographic exploration of audience practices surrounding the video, and, in par-ticular, the differences in reception between the two apps. As Pink (2009) notes,this contextual and embodied engagement with social media is integral to the ethno-graphic experience, particularly when working across platforms and online/offlinecommunities, in a co-production of knowledge. Postill and Pink (2012) write ofthe ‘messy fieldwork environment’ of internet research as it intersects with theresearcher’s way of knowing. This study is no less messy.Data collection differed between TikTok and Twitter, owing to the API restrictionsof the apps. As Twitter restricts general use of its API to historical tweets within thepast seven days, and/or real-time data mining with limitations, Sandbox enterpriseAPI access was acquired, allowing for full-history search utilising a Python script. His-torical tweet searching was limited to tweets in English containing the #YouNeedTo-CalmDown hashtag, which returned 20,448 results. The full dataset was coded inNvivo through word frequency and text search functions, alongside mind mappingtechniques, in order to determine the main themes of the dataset. Rapidminer wasthen used to generate a proportional sample of 500 tweets, which were coded byhand for sentiment/attitude.Contemporary Music Review 5For sentiment coding, I coded tweets as positive if they demonstrate support for thesong/video, support for gay rights, and/or a general positive attitude. Tweets arecoded as neutral if they contain factual information without bias, and negativetweets are those that are explicitly negative towards the song/video, towards commu-nities/individuals, or just in general attitude. Issues that arise in sentiment coding oftweets is the need to understand the meaning of the tweets, as tied to the languageconventions of the platform. As such, it is important to have knowledge of the plat-form-specific semiotics in order to code sentiment and attitude accurately. Forexample, ‘I’m dead’ as a form of praise, ‘stan’ as an indication of a high level of fanpraise, and sarcasm which can only be understood within the wider context of theuser’s tweets, and wider Twitter language conventions.As there is currently no API that allows for data mining of TikTok videos, theTikTok dataset was collected manually, by searching within the app, and collectingrelevant compilation videos on YouTube. Part of the limitation of this research isthe lack of ability to download complete datasets of TikTok videos, as well as theinfluence of geolocation and algorithms on search results built into the app function-ality. In total, 109 videos were compiled and manually coded in regard to videothemes.Research LimitationsA number of limitations exist within this research, including researcher decisions,copyright restrictions, and API limitations. By narrowing my focus to only tweetsthat utilise the #YouNeedToCalmDown hashtag, and TikTok videos that use theYNTCD audio, this eliminates potentially differing results through the explorationof other hashtags, such as #YNTCD, or TikTok videos that reference #YouNeedTo-CalmDown, but without Swift’s audio. It is generally accepted that hashtags areoften used as amplification, community building, and/or digital protest (Gruzd,Wellman, and Takhteyev 2011; Zimmerman 2017; Tremayne 2014), and it is entirelypossible that different findings would emerge based on different hashtags/videos. Forexample, users may not want to align themselves publicly with Swift’s fandom, or mayutilise selected hashtags as a way to co-opt, or disrupt, community/fan messages, asnoted in Christina Neumayer and Bjarki Valtysson’s (2013) study of neo-Nazi’s onTwitter, whereby the #19februar, #13februar and #RaZ10 hashtags served as a siteof conflict between neo-Nazi and antifa groups.The lack of a complete dataset for TikTok videos necessitates that much of thisresearch becomes a co-creation of knowledge, based on my own searching strategiesand results that are often framed by algorithmic predictions. Beyond TikTok’s geolo-cation restrictions, there is no master feed on TikTok whereby you can view all videospublished, in the same way that you cannot view all of Twitter. Twitter user experi-ence is based on who you actively follow, whereas TikTok feeds are organised aroundyour followers, as well as a ‘For You’ page/feed, which is algorithmically produced.For myself, as a late 30s, female, white Canadian emigrant in the United Kingdom,6 M. K. Avdeeffmy TikTok experience would no doubt be much different than that of the maindemographic of users; I am often shown videos that are hashtagged #Over30TikTok.Demographically, 57% of users are based in China (using the Douyin app), and whiledemographics were originally skewed towards a quite young user group, morerecently it has been found that 60% of US users are between 16 and 24, and over50% of users in the United States are aged 18–34. Because users under the age of18 are not included in most published demographics, it is fair to assume that under-age users may actually skew the data downwards, if they were to be included (Iqbal2020).Copyright restrictions also pose a serious limitation to this study, for a number ofreasons: TikTok data collection; the ways in which certain audio files are restricted inparticular countries; and the dynamic nature of copyright and infringement practices.This study is also a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the internet, where, in someways, the adage that ‘the internet is forever’ does not always hold true. When YNTCDwas originally released, Swift’s version was used as the basis for TikTok videos inter-nationally, but, at some unknown point, the audio was restricted to the United States,limiting the videos I could access from the United Kingdom. Utilising the curatedYouTube playlists of TikTok videos imposes an additional layer of taste preferencesand value judgements, which is perhaps not a limitation, but reflective of the realisticinteractions of subjects and communities within social media research, and demon-strates the fluidity of texts across social media platforms, extending the networks ofaudience attention and participation.Whereas remix and reproduction are central to the ethos of TikTok, elements ofremix are nevertheless also integrated into Twitter, particularly in the participatoryfan and audience practices, in relation to popular media/cultural texts (Jenkins2006). The relationship between copyright ownership, social media, and fan-created works ties into bigger issues in the industry surrounding creativity and intel-lectual property. For example, TikTok does provide licenced audio for use, but usersare not restricted to licenced works when uploading audio. Like YouTube, it is up tothe copyright owners to issue warnings and take-down notices.FindingsWhile at first glance it might not seem methodologically appropriate to comparethe predominantly text-based outputs of Twitter with the audiovisual format ofTiktok, it should nevertheless be noted that in the 20,448 tweets with the #You-NeedToCalmDown hashtag dated between 13 June 2019 and 13 September 2019,8.2% (n = 1,675) contain videos, 23.6% (n = 5,855) contain at least one image,and in total, 36% (n = 7,530) contain elements other than text. The mostengaged-with tweets, as found in Figure 1, are those from verified sources, mostnotably celebrities (such as Karamo and Bobby Berk, who were also featured inthe music video), media institutions (such as MTV, RadioDisney), and promotionalmedia (such as PopCrave, and Swift fandom sites). Traditional celebrity presence isContemporary Music Review 7less highlighted in TikTok, and much more aligned with ephermeral celebrity, ormicro-celebrity cultures (Marwick and boyd 2011; Senft 2008) that develop fromwithin the app.Content analysis of the complete Twitter dataset reveals four main themes: ‘gay’(with subthemes of ‘pride’ and ‘shade’); ‘queens’ and ‘crown’; Katy Perry; and positivelistening experiences. Listening practices are not explored in this article, but withinthis theme, users are generally encouraging others to stream the video/track onvarious platforms (Spotify, YouTube), and also expressing support in the form ofterms such as ‘liking’ and ‘loving’ the song. Within the streaming market economy,it makes sense that people would direct others to stream the track/video, as this is cur-rently a major form of revenue (if not a problematic economic model) for artists.Streams translate into chart status, and further exposure.Sentiment analysis of the 500-tweet sample demonstrates an overwhelmingly posi-tive response: 48% (n = 240) of the sample are coded as positive in sentiment, with anadditional 46% (n = 228) coded as neutral. Only 6.4% (n = 32) of the tweets are codedas negative. It should be noted that this includes all negative tweets, as found in thesample, whether the negativity is directed toward Swift or others. For example, nega-tive sentiment is often directed towards those who criticised Swift for her approach toallyship:@figureswift: ‘When Taylor said we all got crowns, she means we ALL got crowns.Except those who take this positive song negatively. Shame on y’all. #YouNeedTo-Calmdown, seriously’ (2019, June 15)@this_wade: ‘If you’re mad about a genuine ally celebrating pride with her friendsand celebrating LGBTQ artists: #YOUNEEDTOCALMDOWN’ (2019, June 17)or by using the hashtag for discussion unrelated to the music video, such as critiquesof Donald Trump:Figure 1 Six most engaged with #YouNeedToCalmDown tweets on Twitter.8 M. K. Avdeeff@AndrewMaltbie: ‘Trump’s tweets reveal who he does – and does not – see asAmerican – Vox #TrumpIsRacist #clearv #MoronInChief He IS The #only#problem with #OurLand ‘GO HOME You #Racist #SonofaBitch #YouNeedTo-CalmDown #Stop making the #USA worse & #split #asshole!!!!!http:/www.voc.com/identities/2019/7/15/20695427/donald-trump-tweet-racist-aoc-tlaib-omar-pressley-nationalism… ’ (2019, July 16)Importantly, when the sample is reduced to tweets with negative sentiment explicitlycriticising Swift, only eight are coded as negative, or 1.6% of the sample, as illustratedby:@foxnbacon: ‘I know we’re supposed to be in love with this Taylor Swift video butthe song is just lacking. #YouNeedToCalmDown’ (2019, June 18)@gayvalidation: ‘#YouNeedToCalmDown is just Bad Blood with gay men instead ofVictoria Secret models.’ (2019, June 17)@MrsKingAnge: ‘Wow #YouNeedToCalmDown is such a triggering song. Also,telling someons to calm down only makes the situation worse. #nextsongplease’(2019, June 14)This sentiment analysis reveals significantly positive results, and is widely divergentfrom reporting in the mainstream press, which tends to highlight controversy. Thepositive reaction to Taylor Swift on Twitter has also been documented in AmandaKehrberg’s (2015) research on the artist, where an examination of 200 tweets directedtowards Swift reveals 88% of them expressing goodwill and compliments. On theother hand, in the past few years, the mainstream press has increasingly adoptedthe strategy of presenting tweets as journalism, in order to curate audience reception,with the implication that the sentiments presented in a small selection of tweets rep-resent the majority response. What my results suggest, however, is that the main-stream press are using selected tweets to evidence desired narratives, which do notnecessarily represent the majority. In this particular case study, the mainstreampress tends to highlight matters of queerbaiting, problematic allyship, and pinkwash-ing, but these sentiments are not statistically significant in an analysis of the Twitterdiscourse.This reporting strategy has potentially significant ramifications for how meaningcirculates within a society. To disproportionately promote controversy and crisisas public sentiment over, in this case, a quite balanced and positive response toa media text, runs the risk of further dividing cultural and political groups,and amplifying conflict. This is not to say that Twitter is without voices of con-troversy, crisis, and critique, but that in this specific case study, positive responsesare often downplayed in reporting of Twitter sentiment by the mainstream press,indicating that this reporting strategy should be further examined, especially inregard to how news is circulated that might not intend to be ‘fake news’, butactually is. In the words of Kanye West (2020), ‘You know that it’s fake if it’sin the news’.Contemporary Music Review 9To connect these findings to the ecology of Twitter, they highlight how voices canbe amplified and associated with public sentiment, though they are not necessarilyreflective of the majority. Further questions need to be asked about how voices areamplified, especially when this is then connected to wider issues such as Twitter’scancel culture (Ng 2020). Swift, in addressing her online ‘trolls’ in YNTCD, is effec-tively making a commentary on Twitter’s prevalence towards hive-mind critiques ofindividuals, which, compounded with the 280-character limit, negates complicateddiscussions and analytical debate in favour of silencing opinions through a shut-down of discourse, or calls to ‘calm down’. For context, Ng defines cancel culture as:the withdrawal of any kind of support… for those who are assessed to have said ordone something unacceptable or highly problematic, generally from a social justiceperspective especially alert to sexism, heterosexism, homophobia, racism, bullying,and related issues. (Ng 2020, 623)As AndrewRoss argues, ‘discursive (de)legitimisation now takes place across a range ofcontemporary digital platforms’ (Ross 2019, 5) and this silencing/delegitimization isalso seen in TikTok, but to a lesser extent than Twitter, at least at the time ofwriting. This is not to say that the app will not evolve to incorporate an increased pres-ence of cancel culture, or that it does not already exist in certain TikTok communities.TikTok, in its early iterations, especially when videos were limited to 15 s, was generallya wholesome, positive space for youth to create viral videos based on memetic contentthat emerged fromwithin the app ecology, as influenced by Vine andMusical.ly. As theapp has grown, and the capabilities of the video format extended, the demographic hasshifted to incorporate older users, particularly parents of the original young users. Thisonly increased during the COVID-19 lockdown, as parents found newways of bondingwith their children and their interests (Richards 2020).With these shifts in demographics, more attention has been paid to ‘drama’ andcontroversy, and social justice themes have also been increasingly incorporated intovideo themes. Although YNTCD was released before the largest influx (thus far) ofolder users, these pre-existing shifts in demographic and content provided a spacethat was well-positioned to respond to Swift’s video and social justice themes.Of the 109 TikTok videos utilising Taylor Swift’s originally recorded chorus toYNTCD, the dataset was then reduced to 96 videos, by excluding those that didnot utilise the YNTCD challenge. The remaining 96 videos all follow the sameformat: a set-up where someone (either the user or the user pretending to besomeone or something else) is being loud, obnoxious, or excessively expressive insome way; and a response where someone/thing reacts to such behaviour (usuallythe same user, but playing a different role) by lip synching to the ‘you need tocalm down; you’re being too loud’ lines as if they were saying these to the firstsubject. A typical format is as follows:Scene 1: (lyrics overlaid on shot of creator acting out youthful exuberance) *Friendsscreaming/laughing loudly at 4am in my house*10 M. K. AvdeeffScene 2: (lyrics overlaid on shot of creator looking annoyed) *Me with strictparents*Scene 3: (creator lip-synching to lyrics: You need to calm down, you’re being tooloud)The TikTok videos were then coded for various attributes, including: setting, sub-jects, perspective, gender, and point of view. Unfortunately, ages of users are notaccessible, but observation shows that the vast majority of videos appear to be byyouths under the age of 18 and living at their family home. Only three videosappear to be created by adults, including one woman who incorporates hertoddler in the video. A breakdown of gender, as observed, finds that the majorityof creators (n = 55, 57%) are coded as female, 34 (36%) as male, and 5 (5%) asmixed gender with more than one person present in the video. That being said,almost all videos contain only one person (n = 89, 93%) occupying multiple rolesin the narrative.Group dances are popular on TikTok, and dance videos are increasingly a way inwhich youth measure the meaning of music in their lives (Fogarty Woehrel 2021),but the current case study suggests that the #YouNeedToCalmDown challenge islargely an individual one, with the humour of one person playing multiples rolesin a conversation being used to downplay the seriousness of the event. The chal-lenge format also provides an easy-to-create video format with the potential togo viral, based not only on the popularity of the challenge, but also on the songitself. Because of the individualism of the challenge, the point of view of thevideos is mostly a combination of switching between first-person POV and thePOV of the respondent, under the assumption that, in those moments, theviewer takes on the role of the first subject, viewing the scenario through their per-spective. In this study’s dataset, POV (where the viewer as viewing subject) isobserved in 18% (n = 17) videos, selfie (where the creator filming themselves astheir own subjectivity) in 8.3% (n = 8), and mixed (videos that switch betweensubject creator and other subject positions in their POVs) occupying the majoritywith 74% (n = 71).In her study on the management of hysteria by police, Mardi Kidwell finds thatin co-present situations, ‘gaze is a central…mechanism for entry into, coordi-nation, and maintenance of face-to-face interaction’ (Kidwell 2006, 745). Aspolice officers seek to counteract hysteria, procuring one’s gaze is an imperativestep towards directive action. Through the role-playing of imperatives to ‘calmdown’ on TikTok, the gaze is offered to the viewer, as they both witness theeffects of the controlling gaze, and the results, as they view the ‘hysterical’ subject’sresponse. This analysis could be further extended into theories of voyeurism andscopophilia (Mulvey 1975), which are unfortunately outside the scope of thisarticle.Space and place are identified as important qualities of the TikTok videodataset. The themes of the video demonstrate key features in the relationshipContemporary Music Review 11between app use, personal relationships, and the spaces in which they occur.Within the narratives of these videos, when considering the implied locationsof each video, 63% (n = 66) take place in domestic environments, 17% (n =18) in public spaces, and 16% (n = 16) in school, presumably high/secondaryschool. That being said, only one video was actually recorded in a publicspace, with the remainder being recorded in what appears to be creators’homes, and, for the most part, bedrooms. The spaces and places are furtherbroken down in Figure 2 to provide more nuance in how space/place connectsto the narrative theme.Given the relatively young age of the users, it is unsurprising that only 3% (n = 3) ofvideos were of an explicitly sexual nature, and both were providing a POV of onesubject looking towards another subject (the creator), and implying that theyshould be quieter while receiving oral sex. These videos feel largely out of syncwith the themes of the remainder, which predominantly centre around peoplebeing too loud at sleepovers, where either the user, or the parents of the housethey are in, would like them to ‘calm down’.Due to the young age of the creators, it is also unsurprising that not only are mostof these narratives set in domestic spaces or schools, but they are also built around astoryline of the user interacting with either their friends or family—but role playingboth parts in the video. As Figure 3 shows, the creator is present as themselves in 86%(n = 83), alongside a role-played version of their friends (30%, n = 31), or familymembers (35%, n = 34).Figure 2 The space and places of YNTCD on TikTok.12 M. K. AvdeeffDiscussionCTDA calls for a theoretical framework that emerges from the cultural context of thetexts being analysed. As both Swift’s video and the response to said video focus onthemes of gay rights, female friendship, and online discourse, my findings are never-theless examined through a feminist and queer theory lens. I also draw on theories ofallyship and silencing, in response to Swift’s intended positionality as an ally toLGBTQ+ communities, and the historical context of telling someone to ‘calmdown’. This discussion is organised around the three themes of intention andresponse to YNTCD, reframed as: online communities and ambient affiliations, per-formative allies, and cancel culture.Communities & Ambient AffiliationsInvestigations of community formation, collective identity, and audience engagementare common frameworks in social media research (Marwick and boyd 2011),especially research located in Twitter (Brown et al. 2017; Highfield, Harrington,and Bruns 2013; Deller 2011), and drawing from this, the current study acknowledgesthat online discourse and engagement are not necessarily removed from offline activi-ties. That being said, owing to the relative newness of TikTok, there is currently noTikTok-specific established framework of analysis. In addition, as outlined above,existing research utilising CTDA and social media platforms tends to incorporate fra-meworks of counterpublics, imagined communities, subaltern communities, and thelike. In this post-social media era, how community and identity exist holistically iscross-platform, but also platform-dependent. Each social media interface affordsFigure 3 YNTCD TikTok video subjects.Contemporary Music Review 13variances in how a presentation of self and forms of communication can occur, incombination with technocultural conventions that are specific to a platform. Socialmedia are also largely democratic environments, allowing for forms of resistance todominant/hegemonic conventions, both within the online space and off.Partially due the nature of the data collection process, the existence of communitiesin both the tweets and TikTok videos are not well-formed in connection withYNTCD. Associations only loosely exist based on hashtags, song choice, and the struc-ture of the memetic challenge. Regardless of the political nature of Swift’s intendedmeaning, neither the tweets nor the TikToks demonstrate strong alignment withcommunities based on counterpublics, the subaltern, and so on. Instead, we seesomething more akin to ambient affiliation, with individuals temporarily broughttogether through their reception to the media text, and/or participation in video chal-lenges. It is the experience of such participation that affords affiliation, but not necess-arily one that meets the level of ‘community’.Michelle Zappavigna defines ambient affiliation as a co-present, impermanentcommunity, ‘bonding around evolving topics of interest’ (2011, 800). In her researchon #Obama tweets, she outlines how linguistic functions, like the hashtag, bring aboutthese affiliations of discursive communities. This affiliation is seen in the #YouNeed-ToCalmDown tweets, as the hashtag has both semiotic and social potential, but theseaffiliations can also be extended into the audiovisual format of TikTok, where we findambient affiliations based on challenges, and audio choices. TikTok affiliation alsooccurs in how users allude and recognise communities in their everyday lives, as con-nected to their domestic, public, and school spaces.Communities of friendship, family, and peerage, are mediated through the TikTokchallenge and its standardised format, allowing young creators to connect with othersthrough their shared experiences of familial relationships. The videos tap into a com-monality of experience that youth face in interactions with authority figures (parents,teachers), and also in negotiating one’s position within a peer group. That thesevideos are being shot and edited largely in one’s bedroom, only further connectsthese practices to wider accounts of the shifting of bedroom culture online,whereby the process of working through one’s emotions and experiences, throughjournaling or talking with friends, is relocated online and into the public domain,and thereby subject to public debate and discourse (Avdeeff 2021; Hodkinson andLincoln 2008; Bovill and Livingstone 2001).These TikTok affiliations do not appear to show any indication of Swift fandom, orengagement with the three themes of the YNTCD video/song. The song merely existsas a medium for the narrative format, documenting common experiences of beingtold, or telling another, that they are being ‘too loud’ and ‘need to calm down’.The track functions well within the format of the app, as the chorus fits nicely intothe 15 s timeframe, and is deterministic enough to create a narrative that is easy toengage with, and provides enough information for viewers to understand, relate to,and be drawn in with the POV experience.14 M. K. AvdeeffPerformative AlliesIn an interview with Vogue magazine (Aguirre 2019), Swift outlines her motivationfor publicly declaring herself an ally to queer communities:Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight whitecisgender male. I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a com-munity that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without beingso fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes arevery loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of theworld. It’s clickbait, and it’s a part of my life story, and it’s a part of mycareer arc.This response appears to be in reaction to the critique by the mainstream press of herrepresentation of pro-gay rights ideology in YNTCD, as well as a longer history ofpublic questioning over her lack of political engagement. Although some articles,of course, do support Swift’s stance and queer representation in the music video,there are also a number of reports of accusations of queer baiting and pinkwashing to be found (Abraham 2019), accusing Swift of performative allyshipthrough the commodification of social activism. These accusations have also followedSwift’s close relationship to Karlie Kloss, and the lack of clarification on their relation-ship status. This is not to say that Swift is not entitled to privacy, especially in regardsto her personal and private relationships, but is only mentioned as documentation ofthe public discourse on the topic. Symbols of gay pride, such as rainbow motifs, playinto these theories of queer baiting, with suggestions that Swift was on the verge ofcoming out as a queer woman.While the press utilise tweets to provide evidence of this discourse of queer baitingand pink washing, the #YouNeedToCalmDown dataset demonstrates a positiveresponse to Swift’s position as ally, regardless of its potential performativity. This per-formancemay be tied to issues of homonormativity in how queerness is represented inthe video, but many fans are still happy to see this representation in the media,especially for someone with the level of platform that Swift has, and even more sowhen compared to howpoliticisedmessages have been received and denigrated histori-cally by country music artists, like the Dixie Chicks. Swift has shifted from country topop music, but nevertheless still retains connections to that cultural space (Figure 4).Narratives of queer identities, or notions of being an ally are not evidenced in anyof the 109 TikTok videos using the YNTCD audio. That aspect of Swift’s text isentirely negated on TikTok, owing to the way in which audio is reworked on theapp. This is not exclusive to Swift’s audio, but is a common feature of the app,where sounds and lyrics are repurposed for new aims, aligned with various ‘chal-lenges’. In addition, users often draw attention to this phenomenon, when challengesare particularly out of sync with the song’s original ‘meaning’.Just as technologies afford unintended uses, so do audiovisual texts. TikTok drawsattention to how users participate in media texts, both responding and producingContemporary Music Review 15through innovation and remix. These ‘unintended’ responses are more prevalent onTikTok than they are on Twitter, which increasingly values and centres cultural own-ership of texts, and the authenticity of interpretation as connected to identity politics.You Need to Calm Down & Cancel CultureTaylor Swift opens YNTCD with:You are somebody that I don’t knowBut you’re taken shots at me like it’s PatrónAnd I’m just like, damn, it’s 7 AMSay it in the street, that’s a knock-outBut you say it in a Tweet, that’s a cop-outAnd I’m just like, ‘Hey, are you okay?’By doing so, she is seen as conflating her experiences with online trolls with thestruggles faced by the marginalisation of LGBTQ+ individuals and communities.This was brought up in the mainstream press (Lewis 2019), and supported byother artists, like Chris of Christine and the Queens (Zheng 2019). Although manytweets indicate that increased queer representation generally outweighs any proble-matic performances of social activism in Swift’s video, those who do express critiqueof Swift’s video tend to align with this perspective, that trolling and LGBTQ+margin-alisation are not comparable in this way (Figure 5).For some listeners, by conflating these experiences, Swift was, herself, participatingin a form of cancel culture, trivialising queer marginalisation by centring the onlinebullying of a highly privileged, straight, cis-gender white woman. It was perceived asnegating the importance of being an effective ally, further demonstrating the perfor-mativity of her positionality. Intriguingly, the critique seems less about Swift’s pos-ition as ally, and more about her conflation of LGBTQ+ marginalisation with herFigure 4 Positive Twitter Response to LGBTQ+ representation in YNTCD.16 M. K. Avdeeffown struggles as a celebrity. Although academic research into allies is often examinedthrough student, not celebrity allies, there are some comparisons that can be madehere. Kendrick Brown and Joan Ostrove define allies as ‘dominant group memberswho work to end prejudice in their personal and professional lives, and relinquishsocial privileges conferred by their group status through their support of nondomi-nant groups’ (Brown and Ostrove 2013, 2211), and by not relinquishing her socialprivileges, Swift’s allyship is interpreted as performance.Camille Baker (2004) provides further nuance to our understanding of allies,noting that allies exist along a continuum from ‘potential’ to ‘active’ ally. WithYNTCD, Swift moved from a potential ally, one whose views remain anonymousin the public domain and lacking the confidence for public exposure, to an activeally, directly challenging homophobia and heterosexism. Although Baker is speakingof students in her research, her point that ‘potential allies can become more visiblyengaged if they are encouraged to speak their minds’ (Baker 2004, 66) still holdstrue in this instance: following the largescale response to YNTCD, Swift has sinceretreated from overtly political themes in her most recent album, Folklore. Thisnew adult contemporary era marks a personal safe space of unpolitical themes, entirelyremoved from social activism. Knight-Steele (2018), echoing Stuart Hall (1981), notesthat ‘privilege dictates that when those of the dominant group create art and enter-tainment there is no burden of representation’ (Knight-Steele 2018, 118–119), andSwift’s positionality allows her to move in and out of these politics of representationat will. However, this is not meant to diminish the efforts she has made with LGBTQA+ representation within this video, or the wider industry shifts she has instigatedwithin the problematic streaming economy.Instead of being subject to the cancel culture that Swift sings about in YNTCD forher performative allyship, she finds overwhelming support on Twitter. With therecent escalation of cancel culture on Twitter with the #MeToo movement, culminat-ing in the ‘cancellation’ of non-celebrity individuals to little long-term effect, Ngnotes that ‘cancel culture itself is now subject to being cancelled’ (Ng 2020, 623).This is reflected in the #YouNeedtoCalmDown dataset, where very few tweets usingthe term ‘cancel’ are doing so in order to cancel Swift. Alternatively, cancel is usedas a way to discuss the mainstream media’s attempts to weaponize Swift fandomtowards cancel culture (Figure 6).Swift’s Twitter audience responds by cancelling cancel culture. Tweets demonstrate apositive response to Swift’s role in increasing queer representation, and her activeFigure 5 Twitter critique of Swift’s pro-gay rights message.Contemporary Music Review 17allyship, in the cancelling of bigotry. Although there are very few tweets which are enga-ging in nuanced, critical discourse around allyship and LGBTQ+ activism, what is notbeingwitnessed is a complete shut-downof discussion surrounding these issues. If any-thing, they represent an exasperation at having to defend Swift, and continually fightagainst LGBTQ+ marginalisation and homophobia in the public domain.Neither a 280 character tweet, a one minute TikTok, nor a two minute and 51 smusic video, affords the space to have a critically engaged and nuanced conversationabout representation and gay rights. However, it is interesting to note that, by tellingtrolls and anti-LGBTQ+ protesters to ‘calm down’, Swift is perpetuating elements ofcancel culture by shutting down possibilities of complex discourse and debate. Herwork still becomes representative of the cancel culture now endemic in Twitter,both reflecting her audience and legitimising the cancel culture which they seek toredress. The question then becomes whether the narrative of being too loud andthe imperative to ‘calm down’ in the TikTok format is, indeed, shifting the politicisednature of Swift’s text, or whether it is a form of cancel culture-lite, connecting to his-torical and ongoing practices of silencing, which are often gendered.ConclusionThe TikTok YNTCD challenge may have ‘silenced’ Swift’s pro-LGBTQ+ message,but not through the delegitimization that can be seen in Twitter’s cancel culture.TikTok, instead, can be seen legitimising a commonality of experience throughthe YNTCD challenge. This is seen not only in this challenge, but throughoutTikTok: a sense that putting one’s subjective experiences on the app serves to vali-date personal experiences, especially for topics that youth (and even adults) findFigure 6 Cancel culture tweets utilisiing #YouNeedToCalmDown.18 M. K. Avdeeffdifficult to speak about in person, out of fear of being different. The online disinhi-bition effect (Suler 2005) encourages such sharing of the personal, and in theTikTok comment sections users express gratitude and support by discovering andvalidating these commonalities. As youth are figuring out their place in theworld, and in their own bodies, some spaces of TikTok have become places of vali-dation, breaking down presumed hegemonic understandings of identity, bodilyfunctions, and relationships.In one of the few currently published works on TikTok, Juan Carlos MedinaSerrano et al. note that, due to the audiovisual nature of the app, and the lack ofsharing of pre-existing content as is often done on Twitter, the users inevitablybecome the content. Therefore, ‘every TikTok user is a performer who externalisespersonal political opinion via an audiovisual act’ (2020, n.p.), highlighting an inter-activity of political communication. The results of the current study reflect this inter-activity of engagement, through the popularity of the YNTCD challenge format, andthe political communication is seen in the reimagination of Swift’s intended mean-ings. Twitter response, in comparison, aligns more explicitly with Swift’s meanings,providing a positive response to the media text.To conclude, this article is as much about methodology as it is about criticalengagement with Swift’s music video as media text. It examines the ways in whichaudience response is often platform-dependent, owing to the conventions and cul-tures apparent within interfaces and platforms. In doing so, it also lays the ground-work for further research examining how meaning circulates through social media,counter to mainstream press narratives.Disclosure StatementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes on ContributorMelissa K.

    "abstract": "For most of her career thus far, Taylor Swift’s cultural outputs have remained apolitical, often addressing heteronormative notions of romance, young adult life, and heartbreak. In 2019, Swift broke her politicised silence with ‘You Need to Calm Down’, a track which self-proclaims the artist as an ally to LGBTQ+ communities through her co-option of language historically used to silence marginalised voices, and the inclusion of LGBTQ+-identified celebrities in the accompanying music video. Through a critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) approach, and incorporating digital ethnography, this article examines and compares the multimodal response to ‘You Need to Calm Down’ on TikTok and Twitter. CTDA multimodal analysis is utilised as a method to ascertain both the cultural situatedness of the track, its reception through digital spaces, and also how that reception is connected to the conventions of each platform. Through an analysis of over 20,000 tweets utilising the #YouNeedToCalmDown hashtag, and over 100 TikTok videos based on the track, I examine platform-specific discourse: the de-politicised mimetic creativity of TikTok in comparison to the more hegemonic interpretations found on Twitter. Discussion is organised around three themes of response to ‘You Need to Calm Down’: online communities and ambient affiliations, performative allyship, and cancel culture",
