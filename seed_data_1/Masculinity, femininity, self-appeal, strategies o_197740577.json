The aim of this study was to explore potential differences in gender identity and interpersonal func-tioning styles between transsexual and non-transsexual women.Method. The following tests were used: Bem Sex Role Inventory (Polish version), Self-Appeal Scale, Inter-personal Styles Scale, and the Strategies of Self-Presentation Questionnaire. The study group consisted of 32 adult transwomen, mean age 35.09 years. The control group consisted of 32 adult cissexual women (mean age 31.69 years) selected according to the age criterion to match the study group.Results. Transsexual women scored higher than non-transsexual women on the femininity scale, in the use of the maintaining-overprotective style, submissive-dependent style and on conformism scales. Non-transsexual women scored higher on the directive-autocratic style, aggressive-sadistic style, competitive-narcissistic style, and partner attractiveness and self-promotion scales. However, there were no statisti-cally significant differences between the groups on masculinity, adonization, interpersonal attractiveness, partner appreciation, self-depreciation, the withdrawing-masochistic style, the rebellious-suspicious style, self-acceptance/complacency, pessimism/helplessness/cry for help, the lie scale, the friendly-cooperative style and the resourcefulness/realism/autonomy scales.Discussion. The study revealed that transsexual women experience themselves and the surrounding world more in accord with the stereotypes of what is feminine than non-transsexual women. This applies to their interpersonal functioning. Styles that they employ to a higher degree usually do not contain com-ponents of dominance and a need for autonomy but rather a need for affiliation and considerateness.Conclusions. Differences in gender identity and interpersonal functioning between transwomen and cis-sexual women might suggest that they are moderated, among other things, by the fact that the former were being raised as males and because they belong to a socially stigmatized group. It seems that trans-women function more in accordance with the stereotypes of femininity than cissexual women.gender identity disorder / transsexualismDOI: 10.12740/APP/58746INTRODuCTIONThe research presented in this paper concerns gender identity, self-appeal, strategies of self-pres-entation and styles of interpersonal functioning of male to female transsexuals and is an attempt to look for potential differences in these aspects be-tween transsexual and cissexual women. Gender identity disorderGender identity disorder (GID), also known as transsexualism, is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as:“A desire to live and be accepted as a mem-ber of the opposite sex, usually accompanied by a sense of discomfort with, or inappropriate-6 Eugenia Mandal, Tomasz JakubowskiArchives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13ness of, one’s anatomic sex, and a wish to have surgery and hormonal treatment to make one’s body as congruent as possible with one’s pre-ferred sex [1]”.GID is characterized by very low occurrence: WHO estimates 1 case for 30[th]000 biologi-cal males and 1 case for 70[th]000 biological fe-males. The aetiology of GID is still a matter of debate, however, most researches conform either to one of the biologically rationalized or psycho-logically justified theories or their idiosyncratic intermediaries, which will be discussed below [2]. One of the prevalent biologically rational-ized concepts of GID aetiology is based on re-search conducted by Reiner and Meyer-Bahl-burg [3]. According to them, the development of GID might be connected to prenatal andro-genization of fetuses. However, the particular mechanism that deter-mines future gender dysphoria is still unknown, and the prenatal androgenization – gender dys-phoria association was observed in transsexu-al women (biological males who identify as fe-males), but not in transmen (biological females who identify as males) [4].Some researchers suggest that one type of oes-trogen feedback response of the pituitary lutein-izing hormone might be responsible for the de-velopment of GID [2]. These theories became an inherent part of a broader group of concepts re-volving around generalized hormone disorders, specifically lack or overdose of androgens dur-ing the perinatal period in biological males and females, respectively [2].Hormone-induced GID aetiology concepts do not exhaust the scope of biologically rational-ized theories. Some researchers suggest that an-atomical and functional abnormalities in sexual-ly dimorphic nuclei in the hypothalamus might be the cause of gender dysphoria, namely, in the nucleus of the preoptic area, the suprachiasmat-ic nucleus, darkly staining posteromedial com-ponent of the bed nucleus of the stria termina-lis, two groups of cells placed in the anterior hy-pothalamus, and the central subdivision of the bed nucleus in the stria terminalis (sexually di-morphic nuclei). Zhou et al. [5] showed that sex-ually dimorphic nuclei are more akin to those of biological females in terms of size and shape than to biological males.Apart from theories seeking the aetiology of transsexualism in human biology, some try to explain this phenomenon by certain psycholog-ical and/or environmental influences on the de-velopment of gender identity. One of the first such theories was formulated by Harry Ben-jamin [6], the pioneer of modern understanding of transsexualism, which he saw as a result of the individual’s fixation on gender, comparable to the phenomenon of imprinting. Benjamin states that transsexualism appears during the critical stage of human development, when the child fixates on the parent of the op-posite sex and begins to identify with him or her so strongly that it abandons its own gender identity for the sake of that of one of its parents. On the other hand, Meyer [7] seeks the cause of transsexualism in the individual’s internal con-flicts which are psychotic in character. An ap-proach similar to Benjamin’s was proposed by Stoller [8], who sees the source of transsexual-ism in the symbiotic relation between the child and the parent of the opposite sex. In cognitive–behavioural approach, the key concept is the re-inforcement of cross-sex behaviours and identi-ty [9]. The psychodynamic and self-psychology approaches consider transsexualism in biologi-cal males to be an effect of the boy’s identifica-tion with an image of the ideal mother, which is maintained throughout his adulthood [9].Gender identityGender identity understood as a socio-psycho-logical concept concerns the way individuals ex-perience and affiliate with certain culture-relat-ed ideas of femininity and masculinity [10], each in its own regard, as proposed by Sandra Bem [11]. She suggests that these interactions and ac-tivities depend on gender schemes, which also facilitate them by providing a general idea how to act according to one’s gender. An interesting development of Bem’s theory was proposed by Levy & Fivush [12] in the form of gender scripts as a group of gender-dependent events. The sig-nificance of interactions and activities undertak-en in the process of maintaining an individu-al’s gender identity, and even further consider-ing gender identity as a process, is the key issue in Judith Butler’s idea of gender performativity [13]. In her view, gender is not an innate feature Masculinity, femininity, self-appeal, strategies of self-presentation and styles of interpersonal   functioning in transsexual women 7Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13of every individual, but it is created by discur-sive means and needs to be maintained through constant performative acts.Such discursive means of constructing one’s gender ought to be in accord with certain strat-egies of self-presentation – “impression manage-ment” – to be successful. Goffman stresses their intentionality and dramaturgic awareness [14]. Baumeister et al. [15] divide them into assertive-conquering and defensive: the first are strategies focused on protecting one’s values and identity in the face of danger, the second focus on main-taining or creating new (better) identities. The next important factors in social function-ing are self-appeal and personality. As suggested by Shea et al. [16], self-appeal might affect inter-personal behavioural styles as well as social atti-tudes. The personality model proposed by Sul-livan [17] and Leary [18], which specifically re-volves around the social aspects of human func-tioning, was thought to be the most appropriate for this study. It describes people in two gener-al dimensions: domination-submission and hos-tility-affiliation. METHODMaterialsFour questionnaires were used in our study: The Bem Sex Role Inventory: Polish version (Inwentarz Płci Psychologicznej; IPP) [19]. The Polish version consists of two scales: femininity (self-perception of one’s adherence to the stere-otypes of a feminine worldview and behaviour) and masculinity (self-perception of one’s adher-ence to the stereotypes of a masculine world-view and behaviour). Both comprise 15 items and their reliability ratios are rtt=0.785 (feminini-ty) and rtt=0.783 (masculinity). Respondents had to rate the items on a 5-point scale ranging from 1, “I am completely not like that” to 5, “I am just like that”. The items included: dominating (mas-culinity scale), sensitive (femininity scale), inde-pendent (masculinity scale).The Self-Appeal Scale (Skala Poczucia Włas-nej Wartości; SPWA) [20]. A Polish �uestion-qnaire which consists of five scales: physical at-tractiveness (Cronbach’s α=0.72) – self-percep-tion of one’s beauty; interpersonal attractive-ness (Cronbach’s α=0.65) – self-perception of one’s sociability; partner attractiveness (Cron-bach’s α=0.73) – self-perception as a partner in a relationship; professional attractiveness (Cron-bach’s α=0.79) – self-perception of one’s profes-sionalism and competence at work; and intel-lectual attractiveness (Cronbach’s α=0.84) – self-perception of one’s cognitive maturity and deci-sion-making abilities. Respondents had to rate the statements using a 5-point scale, where 1 was “I do not agree” and 5 was “I wholeheartedly agree”. Examples of the items are: “I think that my physical condition is satisfactory” (physical attractiveness scale), “I am intellectually gift-ed” (intellectual attractiveness scale), “I want to achieve professional/academic success” (profes-sional attractiveness). The Strategies of Self-Presentation Question-naire (Kwestionariusz Strategii Autoprezentacji; KSA) [21]. It is a Polish questionnaire which comprises 20 items and 5 subscales, each cor-responding to a specific strategy of self-appeal: self-promotion (Cronbach’s α=0.62) – informing others about one’s positive features; adoniza-tion (Cronbach’s α=0.75) – influencing others by one’s gender-related stereotypical behaviours; appreciation of the partner (Cronbach’s α=0.60) – admiration of the partner and preserving his/her high self-esteem; conformism (Cronbach’s α=0.75) – conforming to social norms and con-ventions for the sake of certain benefits; and self-depreciation (Cronbach’s α=0.69) – demeaning oneself. Respondents had to rate the statements on a 5-point scale, where 1 was “I never act like this” and 5 was “I almost always act like this”. The accuracy of the questionnaire equalled 0.79 KMO (Keiser-Mayer-Olkin Index). The items in-cluded: “A woman tries to maintain a position adequate to her interlocutor and hide her differ-ent attitudes and opinions” (conformism scale), “A woman tries to emphasise what is most fem-inine about her appearance – she flexes her neck and smoothes her hair” (adonization scale), “A woman competes with her (male/female) partner with regard to intellectual abilities and profes-sional achievements” (self-promotion scale).The Interpersonal Styles Scale (Skala Ustosun-kowań Interpersonalnych; SUI) [21]. A Polish questionnaire based on the personality theories of Sullivan [17] and Leary [18]. It comprises 70 items grouped into 12 scales: the directive-au-tocratic style scale (reliability ratio rtt=0.78) – a 8 Eugenia Mandal, Tomasz JakubowskiArchives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13style characterized by dominance in relations, which in an extreme form might result in pater-nalization of others and dogmatism; the main-taining-overprotective style scale (rtt=0.82) – helpful, caring dominance in relations, which in an extreme form might result in overprotec-tiveness and self-sacrifice; the friendly-coopera-tive style scale (rtt=0.85) – characterized by sub-missiveness in relations and a strong need to preserve harmony even at the cost of benefits to oneself; the submissive-dependent style scale (rtt=0.69) – characterized by expressing one’s weaknesses and admiration of others in rela-tions; the withdrawing-masochistic style scale (rtt=0.73) – submissiveness and hostility in re-lations and being overly modest; the rebellious-suspicious style scale (rtt=0.87) – hostile and an-tisocial attitude towards others, as well as pas-sivity, distrust and a sense of being abandoned; the aggressive-sadistic style scale (rtt=0.88) – characterized by a hostile attitude towards oth-ers, which might result in verbal and physical aggression; the competitive-narcissistic style scale (rtt=0.72) – domination, hostility in rela-tions and an exaggerated sense of self-esteem as well as instrumental treatment of others; the self-acceptance/complacency scale (rtt=0.73) – the measure of one’s self-esteem in both nega-tive and positive aspects; the lie scale (rtt=0.89) – the measure of one’s truthfulness as well as the degree to which one’s self-image accedes to the reality; the resourcefulness/realism/auton-omy scale (rtt=0.87) – the measure of one’s fo-cus on certain goals; and the pessimism/help-lessness/cry for help scale (rtt=0.71) – the meas-ure of one’s general attitude towards their past/present/future well-being. Respondents had to rate the items on a 3-point scale with answers “Yes”, “Neither” and “No”. Here are some ex-amples of the items: “I am inclined to think of myself as a person of strong character” (direc-tive-autocratic style scale), “Sometimes I praise myself a little” (lie scale), “It is very important for me to be liked by everyone” (friendly-coop-erative style scale).<koniec listy>As well as these four inventories, a short question-naire concerning demographic variables devised by the authors of this paper was used. It comprises questions about respondents’ personal information, such as age, transsexuality and education.The study group consisted of 32 adult trans-sexual women, mean age 35.09 years (SD=9.61), and the control group consisted of 32 adult non-transsexual women selected according to the age criterion to match the study group (M=31.69, SD=8.47). The entire control group and 20 per-sons (62.5%) from the study group were con-tacted in person, while the rest were contacted via the internet (transgender social media (Fa-cebook) groups, crossdressing.pl, transfuzja.org) and the questionnaires were sent to them by e-mail. All women in the study group have been diagnosed with gender identity disorder according to the ICD-10 criteria [1] and are un-dergoing hormone replacement therapy; 17 have had their names legally changed and are recog-nized as women by the state and the remain-ing 15 are at various stages of this legal change. Out of the 17 women, 5 have undergone orchid-ectomy (the surgical removal of both testicles), while 7 have had the full sex reassignment sur-gery; the remaining 4 did not reveal what they did after they had changed their names. Twen-ty-two of the transsexual women in the study group declared that they are heterosexual, 7 – bisexual and the remaining 3 – homosexual. Of the control group, 29 cissexual women declared that they are heterosexual, 2 – bisexual and 1 – homosexual.The data were processed with one-way anal-ysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Mann-Whit-ney U-test.RESulTSThe analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between transwomen and cissexual women on the psychological femininity scale: transwomen scored significantly higher than cis-sexual women. No statistically significant differ-ence between the two groups appeared on the psychological masculinity scale (Table 1).The one-way analysis of variance did not re-veal any statistically significant difference in the interpersonal attractiveness scale between the two groups, however, the Mann-Whitney U-test revealed one statistically significant differ-ence concerning personal attractiveness, where the study group scored lower on partner attrac-tiveness than the control group (Table 2) The one-way analysis of variance did not re-veal any statistically significant differences in Masculinity, femininity, self-appeal, strategies of self-presentation and styles of interpersonal   functioning in transsexual women 9Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13adonization between transwomen and cissexu-al women, but it revealed two statistically sig-nificant differences in strategies of self-presen-tation, namely in the conformism and self-pro-motion scales (Table 3 – next page).

The study revealed that the transsexual group had a stronger sense of being feminine than cis-sexual women. This might mean that transwom-en consider themselves very feminine in terms of experiencing/interacting with the world and that their way of thinking and behaviour could be described as being in accord with feminine stereotypes. Alternatively, it could be a strategy used by transwomen to fit into the cis- and hete-ro-normative society; they overexert themselves to fulfil its perceived gender norms.As for self-appeal, in the sense of personal at-tractiveness, the analysis revealed statistically significant differences in partner attractiveness, where transwomen scored lower than non-trans-sexual women. This might mean that transsexu-al women consider themselves less attractive as partners in intimate relationships than cissexu-al women. This confirms the results of research conducted by Kampania Przeciwko Homofobii (Campaign Against Homophobia), where 55.3% of transsexual respondents were single and 63.9% believed that they have at least a slightly smaller chance to have a relationship than cis-sexual individuals [22].Masculinity, femininity, self-appeal, strategies of self-presentation and styles of interpersonal   functioning in transsexual women 11Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13However, no statistically significant differ-ences were observed in the case of physical, in-terpersonal, professional and intellectual at-tractiveness. This is not what we had expected: transphobia and internalized transphobia seem to have no influence on these types of person-al attractiveness. Such a social stigma and its in-ternalized variant usually affect many aspects of one’s self-image [23], in the light of which our re-sults seem rather surprising.Our research results showed that transwom-en might more eagerly employ the conformist strategy of self-presentation, which could pos-sibly result from lower self-esteem caused ei-ther by internalized transphobia or/and by ex-periencing transphobia expressed by others [24, 25], as well as a way of conforming to the ster-eotype of woman as a person of a more passive nature and withdrawing her own opinion for the sake of others. More or less the same rationale can be applied to the differences shown in the use of self-promotion strategies. In the case of adonization, self-depreciation and appreciation of partner, no statistically significant differenc-es between the groups were observed. As in the previous case, these strategies seem to be em-ployed equally by both groups, however, the lack of influence of transphobia on the frequen-cy with which these strategies are employed by transwomen is rather surprising [24, 25]. The results of the study suggest that trans-women employ the directive-autocratic style to a lesser degree than non-transsexual wom-en. Due to the strong dominance component in this style, it could be perceived as stereo-typically masculine and because of that trans-sexual women might not be so eager to use it. Conversely, transwomen might be more keen to employ the maintaining-overprotective style because it involves behaviour which meets so-cietal expectations: living in harmony and car-ing for others fits well the stereotype of what is considered feminine. The study revealed that transwomen might be more eager to employ the submissive-dependent style than cissexual wom-en. This might be because they belong to a so-cially stigmatized group, or because of transpho-bia or internalized transphobia, and might result in lower self-esteem [24, 25]. On the other hand, this style of interpersonal functioning might be considered as stereotypically feminine and be-cause of that it might be more readily adopted by transsexual women.The aggressive-sadistic style is employed by transsexual women to a lesser degree than by non-transsexual women. This might result from the fact that this type of behaviour is perceived as not stereotypically feminine.What also emerged is that transwomen might employ the competitive-narcissistic interperson-al functioning style less readily than cissexual women. This style highlights the need for indi-vidualism, autonomy and dominance over oth-ers and as such is not perceived as stereotypical-ly feminine. This may suggest that transwom-en feel a strong need for affiliation and a life of harmony, but it might also be the result of low-er self-esteem due to transphobia of either kind [24, 25]. The study did not reveal statistically signifi-cant differences between the groups in the case of the friendly-cooperative style, withdrawing-masochistic style, self-acceptance/complacen-cy scale, lie scale, resourcefulness/realism/au-tonomy scale and pessimism/helplessness/cry for help scale. Particularly striking is the lack of differences on the self-acceptance/compla-cency scale and in the use of the withdrawing-masochistic style; in the context of the data con-cerning transphobia experienced in Poland [22], the transsexual women’s score on the first scale might have been expected to be higher than that of cissexual women, and in the latter – just the opposite. Similar scores in the two groups in the rest of the scales mentioned above could signi-fy there are no differences between them, or that transwomen actively modify their beliefs to be in accord with femininity stereotypes.A permeating theme of transsexual women’s functioning is the stigma of belonging to a gen-der minority. It could be the result of transpho-bia, if transwomen are stigmatized by others be-cause of their gender identity and expression, of internalized transphobia, if transwomen possess maladaptative beliefs concerning their transsex-uality, or of both homophobia and internalized homophobia, if transwomen are of non-hetero-sexual orientation [26]. The extent of transpho-bia in Poland, and in Eastern Europe in gener-al, may be far greater than the extent of the phe-nomenon reported in the research conducted in Western Europe and North America [22, 26]. 12 Eugenia Mandal, Tomasz JakubowskiArchives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, 2015; 3: 5–13This may affect transwomen’s decision to reveal their transsexuality (“come out”). Living a life of deception, as the research suggests [27], may be the cause of a high, and still rising, rate of su-icide among transwomen [28, 29].Considering the above, the main focus of men-tal healthcare for transwomen, especially in psy-chotherapy, ought to be their destigmatization as members of gender (and sometimes sexual) mi-nority. They should be taught how to use strat-egies of coping with the stress of belonging to a minority group [30, 31] as well as how to re-formulate maladaptative beliefs about transgen-der, for instance in affirmative psychotherapy for sexual minorities [32].CONCluSIONSThe analysis of our research results revealed significant differences between the groups of transsexual and cissexual women in the sense of psychological femininity. Transwomen seem to live more in accord with stereotypes about femininity than cissexual women do. This could be a strategy employed to fit in in a cis- and het-ero-normative society and to avoid the stigma of belonging to a gender (and sometimes sexu-al) minority.No significant differences were observed be-tween the groups in the sense of psychologi-cal masculinity. This could result from an active reduction of stereotypically masculine behav-iours and beliefs by transwomen. In the case of self-appeal, significant differences occurred in the sense of partner attractiveness, where trans-women consider themselves less attractive than their cissexual counterparts do, which seems to confirm the results of other studies [22]. Trans-women seem to be more conformistic and less eager to promote themselves in acts of self-pres-entation than cissexual women. Styles of inter-personal functioning, which contain components of dominance and the need for autonomy, and might suggest high self-esteem, are employed to a lesser degree by transwomen than by cis-sexual women. This may result from transpho-bia and internalized transphobia experienced by transwomen [25, 26]. Where transphobia and in-ternalized transphobia are experienced, mental healthcare professionals should focus on gen-der-affirmative therapy [32], ensuring transsexu-al women feel comfort and a sense of safety.Finally, we acknowledge that the study may not have a wide applicability to the transwom-en population because of significantly greater transphobia observed in Poland than in North America and Western Europe.

    "abstract": "Aim: The aim of this study was to explore potential differences in gender identity and interpersonal functioning styles between transsexual and non-transsexual women. Method: The following tests were used: Bem Sex Role Inventory (Polish version), Self-Appeal Scale, Interpersonal Styles Scale, and the Strategies of Self-Presentation Questionnaire. The study group consisted of 32 adult transwomen, mean age 35.09 years. The control group consisted of 32 adult cissexual women (mean age 31.69 years) selected according to the age criterion to match the study group. Results: Transsexual women scored higher than non-transsexual women on the femininity scale, in the use of the maintaining-overprotective style, submissive-dependent style and on conformism scales. Nontranssexual women scored higher on the directive-autocratic style, aggressive-sadistic style, competitivenarcissistic style, and partner attractiveness and self-promotion scales. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups on masculinity, adonization, interpersonal attractiveness, partner appreciation, self-depreciation, the withdrawing-masochistic style, the rebellious-suspicious style, self-acceptance/complacency, pessimism/helplessness/cry for help, the lie scale, the friendly-cooperative style and the resourcefulness/realism/autonomy scales. Discussion: The study revealed that transsexual women experience themselves and the surrounding world more in accord with the stereotypes of what is feminine than non-transsexual women. This applies to their interpersonal functioning. Styles that they employ to a higher degree usually do not contain components of dominance and a need for autonomy but rather a need for affiliation and considerateness. Conclusions: Differences in gender identity and interpersonal functioning between transwomen and cissexual women might suggest that they are moderated, among other things, by the fact that the former were being raised as males and because they belong to a socially stigmatized group. It seems that transwomen function more in accordance with the stereotypes of femininity than cissexual women",
