For this reason, cultural \ncriminologists often focus on the simultaneous forces of cultural inclusion \nand social exclusion when explaining criminal, deviant, or transgressive \nbehaviors. This is a particularly useful bricolage for examining \ncontemporary gay deviance and transgression—behaviors that are \nperhaps closely linked to (if not directly caused by) the past isolation, \nmarginalization and/or oppression of homosexuals by Western \nheteronormative societies. It is also useful for understanding behaviors \nthat are the result of marginalization and oppression from other sources, \nnamely, the gay community itself. Using subcultural theories of \ndeviance—such as those favored by cultural criminologists—this article \nexplores a perspective that can be used for exploring certain forms of \ngay deviance and transgression. First, some of the more ostensible \ncriminological theories that satisfy a prima facie criminological inquiry will \nbe presented and critiqued: labeling and stigma, and resistance to \nheteronormativity. To these will be added a new and potentially \nproductive way of thinking that takes into consideration rule-breaking as \na form of resistance to homonormative norms, values and rules. \n \nCriminology’s Neglect \n \nThere are several schools of thought that deserve recognition for their \ncontributions to current understandings of gay identity and gay \nbehaviour. For example, queer theorists explore the ways in which queer \nidentity ‘‘intersects with other marginal identities of individuals and \ncommunities’’ (Rosenblum 1994: 85). Public health and behavioral health \nresearchers examine the reasons why gay men and men who have sex \nwith men (MSM) engage in ‘‘high risk’’ drug and sex activities (see \nGroombridge 1999). While these frameworks can help explain certain \naspects of gay/MSM behavior, other disciplines— such as criminology—\nhave reached different conclusions for explaining crime, deviance, and \ntransgression committed by members of marginalized populations. Yet, \nlittle, if any criminological attention is given to criminal, deviant, or \ntransgressive acts committed within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgendered and (sexually) questioning (LGBTQ) community. It is for \nperhaps this reason that behaviors such as same-sex domestic violence, \ngay drug usage, and gay sex work—crimes in most Western societal \njurisdictions— often fall under the purview of studies outside of \ncriminology. Unfortunately, criminology, when it turns its focus towards \nthe LGBTQ community specifically, tends to focus on crimes committed \nagainst LGBTQs, such as hate crimes (Groombridge 1999; see also \n Sorainen 2003). \nArguably, experimental and quasi-experimental research methods (e.g., \nrandom sampling and prediction modeling)—methods often used by \n‘‘mainstream’’ criminologists— are difficult to employ when studying \n‘‘invisible minorities’’ (see Morales 1989; Lopez and Chims 1993). Gay \nmen comprise one such minority. However, Groombridge notes that \ncriminology has a ‘‘long record of selectively ignoring deviance \nassociated with new social movements’’ (1999: 532). Also, criminologists, \nin general, tend to view sexuality as ‘‘normatively heterosexual’’ \n(Groombridge 1999: 543; see also Sorainen 2003). Or, it could be related \nto criminology’s reluctance to acknowledge that crime, deviance, and \ntransgression often ‘‘erupt out of social processes’’ (Presdee 2000: 11), \nsuch as the social exclusion—and, as postulated here, inclusion—of \nintimate lesbian and gay relationships. \nCultural criminology, however, emerged out of a discontent with the \nprinciples of classical and positivist (i.e., ‘‘mainstream’’) criminology—the \nfirst of which placed too much emphasis on the role of determinism, \nwhilst the second leaned too heavily on the ‘‘evidence’’ of empiricism. \nCultural criminologists argue that crime, deviance, and transgression are \nnot determined—or even predictable—but rather, are part of an ongoing \nprocess that is interwoven with culture and all of its attendant meaning, \n‘‘shared symbolism[s]’’ and ‘‘collective interpretation[s]’’ (Ferrell et al. \n2008: 1). This bricolage is particularly useful when discussing gay \n‘‘deviance’’ and transgression, regardless of whether these behaviors \nconstitute crimes, or whether they simply offend the sensibilities of \nothers. \n \nWhy Cultural Criminology? \n \nThere are two premises upon which cultural criminology chiefly resides. \nThe first holds that crime, deviance, and transgression are typically \nsubcultural in nature (Ferrell et al. 2008); the second, that these \nbehaviors are often the product of processes related to the simultaneous \nforces of cultural inclusion and social exclusion (Young 2012). These \nperspectives can be used to explain a diversity of gay behaviors because \ngay men are, in fact, diverse—culturally, ethnically, racially, spiritually, \nand so on. Rosenblum (1994) states: \n \nMany of us are dykes, fags, bisexuals, radical feminists and other \nsubversive heterosexuals, transvestites, transsexuals, poor queers, \nBlack queers, Asian-American queers, Latino queers, homos, drag \nqueens, leather queens and dykes, muscle queens, lipstick lesbians, bull \ndykes, gay women, etc. The vast intersectionality and diversity of queer \nidentities all situate along the queer continuum; extending [even] to those \nwho do not identify with it. (1994: 91). \n \n Indeed, the gay community, once a subculture, now a culture unto its \nown—and replete with its own host of subcultures—possesses its own \ndynamic set of symbols and meanings. For example, the pink triangle, \nthe rainbow flag, the ‘‘hankie’’ code, and ‘‘Polari’’1 are the byproducts of \na history of collective marginalization, oppression and stigmatization—\nfrom the criminalization of homosexual sex, to the barring of same-sex \ncouples from heterosexual institutions (adoption, marriage, military \nservice, etc.), to the systematic extermination of homosexuals during the \nWorld War II. \n \nGay Discontent \n \nThroughout history, MSM—and more recently ‘‘gay’’ men—have been \nstigmatized by the oppressive and marginalizing policies of numerous \nsystems of social control (criminal law, canon (church) law, medicine,  \npublic  health,  behavioral  sciences,  etc.).  In  the  past 40 years, \nhowever, sweeping changes have been made to numerous local, \nregional and federal policies in the United States, Europe, and beyond: in \nmany places, homosexuality has been de-pathologized and de-\nmedicalized (see Conrad and Schneider 1992), sexual acts between \nsame-sex consenting adults have been decriminalized (see Fradella \n2002, 2003), and gay- and lesbian-related (and in some jurisdictions, \ntransgender-related) dis- crimination has been outlawed. Additionally, \nthere has been considerable easing of many of the former barriers to \nWestern societal institutions, such as adoption, civil unions, marriage, \nand military service. \nNonetheless, at a time when global gays and lesbians have made great \nstrides towards establishing their equal rights, there seems to have \nemerged new forms of deviant and/or transgressive behaviors among \ngay men, in particular, that seem to run counter to notions of LGBTQ \nsolidarity. In a recent article taken from the popular UK-based gay online \nmagazine, QX London, writer Johnny Marsh observes, \n \nGay people have more rights, are better protected by the law, and should \nenjoy a greater sense of equality in [their] day-to-day lives. Yet, the gay \ncommunity does not seem to be as happy as perhaps it should be. Some \ngay men continue to fall into a lifestyle of destruction and self-harm \nfuelled by a crisis of gay identity. (Marsh 2012: 1). \n \nEvidence of this ‘‘destructive’’ counternormative lifestyle can be found in \nboth the ‘‘virtual’’ and the ‘‘real’’ worlds, and consist of behaviors ranging \nfrom the (questionably) noncriminal [e.g., barebacking (condomless sex); \nbreeding (the passing of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV); bug \nchasing (the seeking out of HIV self-infection); organized conversion \nparties (sex parties in which multiple HIV-seropositive men take turns \n‘‘breeding’’ an HIV-seronegative individual or individuals)] to criminal \n [e.g., intentional nondisclosure of HIV-seropositivity to sex partners; \nsharing of sexualized drug experiences such as blowing clouds and/or \nslamming2 via dedicated webcam sites and PC applications (see \nFrederick 2013)]. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that, for \nsome ‘‘sexually subversive’’ subcultures of gay men (see Rosenblum \n1994), these and other sexual experiences are often enhanced with party \ndrugs such as crystal methamphetamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (and \nother GABA analogues), ketamine, mephedrone, and 3,4- methylene-\ndioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or ‘‘ecstasy’’), to name a few (Kelly et \nal. 2011; Nan´ın et al. 2011; Solomon et al. 2012). Although the reasons \nfor engaging in crime, deviance, or transgression are numerous and \nindividualized, it would be imprudent to disregard the existence of \ncommon factors that may influence these behaviors, especially within \npopulations that share a common bond. Gay men comprise one such \npopulation. \nMuch gay deviance and transgression is perhaps closely linked to (if not \ndirectly caused by) the isolation, marginalization and/or oppression of \nhomosexuals by Western hetero- normative societies (see Ferrell et al. \n2008). These behaviors can thus be explained using subcultural theories \nof deviance (such as those favored by cultural criminologists). This article \nthus explores the suitability of these perspectives for understanding gay \ndeviance and transgression, specifically. First, some of the more \nostensible criminological theories— that satisfy a prima facie \ncriminological inquiry—will be presented and critiqued: labeling and \nstigma, and resistance to heteronormativity. To these will be added a \nnew and potentially productive way of thinking that takes into \nconsideration rule-breaking as a form of resistance to homonormativity. \n \nLabels and Stigma \n \nFew would contend that men who have sex with other men—whether gay \nor MSM3—have been (and to a large extent, still are) negatively labeled \nby those who find their sexual preferences or lifestyles to be \ncontemptible: ‘‘faggots,’’ ‘‘perverts,’’ ‘‘poofters,’’ ‘‘queers,’’ for example. \nEven those who do not identify as gay, per se, can often be the object of \nlabels such as ‘‘repressed homosexual’’ or ‘‘closet case’’ (see Dollimore \n1991). Labeling has been cited in numerous studies as a contributing \nfactor for such gay/MSM behaviors as bareback sex (see Grov and \nParsons 2006); chronic drug use (see Rhodes et al. 1999); and, the \nintentional transmission of HIV (see Grov 2004). \nOne of the first researchers to explore the link between labeling and \ndeviance was sociologist Howard Becker (1963), who, in his book  \n \n1Gay slang originating in nineteenth century England (see Kulick 2000). \n2The smoking and/or injection of drugs, typically crystal \nmethamphetamine or mephedrone, but also others. \n  \n \nOutsiders argued that deviance was the product of being labeled as such \n by society. According to Becker, the ‘‘deviant’’ merely wore the label (by \nwhich he was then subsequently judged). Indeed, Katz (1994) explains \nhow the ‘‘homosexual’’ was, in fact, invented, and that, prior to the 1950s \nindividuals were not defined (i.e., labeled) by the types of sex in which \nthey chose to engage. Katz uses the example of the act of sodomy: \nwhereas today one might assume that a man who engages in anal \nintercourse with another man is gay, in a historical context he was \nreferred to by a different label—‘‘sodomite’’—and judged accordingly. \nLikewise, the concept of a loving, homosexual relationship is relatively \nrecent—it was only after 1880, ‘‘in medical writing, in literature, and in the \ntestimony of men and women themselves, [that] one finds an effort to \nredefine the meaning and the experience of homo- sexual behavior into a \ndistinctive identity’’ (D’Emilio 1992: 183; see also Woods 2013). \nGoffman (1963) furthered the discussion on labeling by addressing its \nstigmatizing consequences, especially when the label was attached to \nattributes outside the locus of individual control—for example, poor \nhealth, physical appearance, or, as postulated here, sexual identity. \nGoffman believed that these types of labels had the potential to engender \nfeelings of stigma that might cause an individual to conceive of himself as \n‘‘damaged.’’ It follows then, that if a person is negatively labeled \naccording to his sexual identity (or sexual behaviors), he might assume a \nnegative self-perception and commence to engage in sexually ‘‘deviant’’ \nbehaviors. Or, any existing drug- or sex-related ‘‘deviance’’ might, in turn, \nbe ‘‘amplified,’’ causing him to seek out higher plateaus of deviance of \nwhich to ascend (see Wilkins 1967). \nSome gay men choose to identify with, or ‘‘own,’’ labels (see Hebdige \n1979). Indeed, the members of activist groups such as Queer Nation and \nthe Radical Faeries have re- appropriated formerly negative labels. \nAdditionally, many gay men and MSM often construct online ‘‘screen \nnames’’ using labels that were formerly hurled as epithets: ‘‘pervert,’’ \n‘‘pig,’’ ‘‘poofter,’’ ‘‘twisted,’’ for example (Frederick 2013). Others \ninternalize labels, which, for some gay men, can lead to stigma-related \nbehaviors. For this reason, some gay drug- and sex-related behaviors \nhave been characterized as reactions to stigmatizing experiences \nenacted upon gay men by ‘‘outsiders’’ (see Becker 1963). Even the \nprocess of ‘‘coming out’’ can be preceded by a phase wherein the \nindividual, ‘‘either unaware of her/his sexuality or shar[ing] a general view \n[of homosexuality]’’ (Davies 1992: 75) may believe that he will be \n \n3 The assumption here is that MSM, because they do not identify as \n‘‘gay,’’ would not be labeled as such unless someone learned about their \nsexual proclivities, and if the person so making the discovery assumed \nthat the individual was gay. \n  \n ‘‘degraded, denounced, devalued, or treated as different’’ (Plummer \n1992: 175). Unchecked stigma in gay men has been linked to drug use \n(Halkitis et al. 2005; Semple et al. 2006); nondisclosure of HIV status \n(Chesney and Smith 1999; Siegel et al. 1998); sexual compulsivity \n(Semple et al. 2006); and even the seeking out of intentional HIV \ninfection (Gauthier and Forsyth 1999). \nThe association of gay men with the early AIDS epidemic of the 1980s \ncontinues to be a main source of stigma, as well. Although the initial \noutbreak has long since passed and medical advancements have \nmitigated the harmful effects of HIV, ‘‘the very idea of HIV has \n[nonetheless] shaken Americans’ sense of security and fostered deep \nfear and distrust of people with HIV’’ (Kaplan 2012: 2). Not only does \nHIV/AIDS continue to evoke feelings of guilt and shame for many \nsurvivors (Botnick 2000), numerous studies have linked ‘‘risky’’ gay drug \nand sex behaviors to ‘‘feelings of shame, guilt, or sadness associated \nwith having [risked] HIV-infection … or survival guilt over having outlived \nthe epidemic’’ (Frederick 2013: 5; see also Botnick 2000; Davis et al. \n2006). It has also been suggested that the emergence of the party ‘n’ \nplay and chem sex subcultures (gay sub- cultures that typically use \ncrystal methamphetamine, mepehdrone and/or GHB to enhance \nindividual and/or group sexual experiences) found throughout Australia, \nEurope, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States can be \ntraced back to the stigmatizing experiences associated with the early \nyears of the AIDS epidemic (Kurtz 2005; Shernoff 2005; Westhaver \n2005; Green and Halkitis 2006). \nNonetheless, to continue to cite Western heteronormative societies as \nthe predominant sources for gay stigma not only presupposes the belief \nthat labeling and stigma occur at levels commensurate with the past, it \ndraws attention away from the fact that the gay community, itself, can \nalso be a source. Indeed, research has demonstrated that gay- enacted \nstigma is experienced by gay men with HIV/AIDS (Botnick 2000), \neffeminate men (Payne 2007), gay men of colour (Tsang 1994; Smit et \nal. 2011), older gay men (Smit et al. 2011), and even gay men with \n‘‘bodies that do not ‘fit’’’ (Mowlabocus 2007: 71; see also Flowers et al. \n2000). \nOf course, some gay men may not experience stigma related to their \nsexuality or other personal characteristics. Or, they may experience \nstigma from ‘‘outsiders’’ and not from other gay men, or vice versa. \nNonetheless, these men may still engage in ‘‘deviant’’ or transgressive \nbehaviors for other reasons. One possible reason is a form of resistance \nto heteronormative ideals and values. \n \nHeteronormative Resistance \n \nLike the subcultural transformations of style described by Hebdige \n (1979), some forms of deviant or transgressive gay behaviors are \nperhaps constructed as forms of speech that are intended to offend \n‘‘outsiders’’ (Hebdige’s ‘‘the silent majority’’), in that they risk violating \nheteronormative notions of discretion and inclination with respect to sex \n(see Browning 1993). Obviously, for self-identified gay men, the process \nof homo- socialization begins at different times and takes different forms. \nWhile there is no hard- and-fast rule as to when or how this must occur, \nthe logical assumption would be that this ‘‘secondary’’ socialization \nprocess begins shortly before the time at which the individual makes a \nconscious decision to live his life, to varying degrees of course, as an \nopen and visible gay man. This suggests a rejection of at least some of \nthe heteronormative values and beliefs he may have previously held. It \nmight also suggest a breaking of heteronormative rules. \nIn his book Delinquent Boys, sociologist Albert Cohen (1955) described \nthe ‘‘delinquent’’ subculture as sharing: \n \nnot only a set of rules, [but] a design for living which is different from or \nindifferent to or even in conflict with the norms of the ‘‘respectable’’ adult \nsociety. … the delinquent subculture takes its norms from the larger \nculture but turns them upside down (Cohen 1955: 28). \n \nA decade later, in Deviance and Control, Cohen (1966) reintroduced the \nnotion that delinquency is predicated on the recognition of and \nadherence to rules—in organizations, in institutions, and in society as a \nwhole—as well as the negative and positive consequences of rule-\nbreaking behaviors. According to Cohen, ‘‘if human beings are to do \nbusiness with one another, there must be rules, and people must be able \nto assume that, by and large, these rules will be observed’’ (1966: 3). \nCohen’s observation is nevertheless problematic in that Western \nheteronormative societies do not provide alternative ‘‘gay rules of \nbehavior’’ for children. Neither would parents—provided they knew what \nto look for—be able to determine early enough whether their child, in fact, \nrequired a gay-specific set of ‘‘rules’’ (see Davies 1992). Equally \nproblematic is the fact that the LGBTQ com- munity has a very recent \nhistory of nonconformity—many LGBTQ individuals and groups have \neven openly (and sometimes aggressively) rejected heteronormative \nvalues (see Rosenblum 1994). In fact, according to Browning, ‘‘Being \nqueer … is about refusing [emphasis added] to be imprisoned by \nheterosexual conventions’’ (1994: 71), the evidence of which can be \nseen in the numerous carnivalesque displays of gay ‘‘pride’’—and even \n‘‘gay shame’’ (Silverstone 2012)—events throughout the world today. \nIn his thesis on cultural inclusion/social exclusion, Young (2012) \ncharacterizes Merton’s 1938 thesis Social Structure and Anomie as a \nrecontextualization of social positivism in that it portrays crime—and as \nalso postulated here, deviance and transgression—as more the result of \nindividual who have been deprived of societal aspirations (for instance, \n the ‘‘American Dream’’)—not, as popularly held, as a result of material \ndeprivation or lack of opportunity. It is possible, then, that for some gay \nmen, the image of the successful married gay male represents a similar, \nunachievable—or even, undesirable—‘‘Gay Dream.’’ The realization, \nthen, that this lifestyle may be unattainable (or even unsuitable) may \ndrive some men to engage in deviance and transgression for entirely \ndifferent reasons, as will be discussed in the next section. \n \nHomonormative Resistance \n \nFor many gay men, the transition from hetero- to homonormativity \nsuggests a participation (again to varying degrees) in at least some, if not \nmost of the sociocultural institutions that are specific to gay men (Davies \n1992): bars, bathhouses, community resource centers, nightclubs, \nreligious organizations, and saunas, to name a few. As with \nheteronormativity in Western societies, homonormativity is also nuanced \nby factors such as age, culture, ethnicity, gender, race, and spirituality \n(Rosenblum 1994; see also Butler 2004; Ward 2008). Because gay men \nare diverse, some men may seek inclusion in homonormative institutions, \nwhilst others will not view this as a priority. Likewise, some men may \nchoose to adopt gay subcultural values, whilst others may act as ‘‘lone \nwolves.’’ Using such an explanation, some forms of gay deviance and \ntransgression could thus be interpreted as potential attempts to ‘interrupt \nthe process of ‘‘normalization’’’ (Hebdige 1979: 18) that is currently being \nushered in by the contemporary gay rights movement. \nMowlabocus (2007) defines metropolitan gay culture as ‘‘the most stable, \nsocially recognized, politically assimilated and economically productive \nexpression of homosex- uality to be found in the West today’’ (2007: 62). \nA sort of gay ‘‘mainstream,’’ Mowlabocus observes that, metropolitan gay \nculture is ‘‘physical’’ [referring to ‘‘the gay village, and the proliferation of \nclubs and bars of shops and cafes that cater to urban gay men’’ (2007: \n62)], and that it is also a lifestyle—‘‘a way of being and a way of being \nseen as gay’’ (2007: 62). Interestingly, Mowlabocus’ definition articulates \nseveral outcomes that, in order to be achieved, would suggest the \nexistence of norms and rules that gay men would be logically expected to \nadhere to, if not embrace, in their pursuit. These outcomes also suggest \nthe existence of rules and norms that are commensurate with those \nfound in heteronormative societies, inasmuch as they lead to stability, \nsociability, economic viability, and participation in the (LGBTQ) political \nprocess. \nIn order for gay men to enjoy positive relations with one another, then—\nindeed, in order for them to enjoy positive relations with ‘‘others’’ in \nsociety, as well—some common ‘‘gay ground rules’’ must be established. \nYet, Cohen (1966) held that, some persons, ‘‘because of their special \npersonal characteristics [may] have wants that the rules do not recognize \nas legitimate’’ (1966: 7). Consequently, if these ‘‘special’’ individuals are \n not given a legit- imate ‘‘safety valve’’ for the expression of these needs, \nthey may eventually strike out at both the rules and ‘‘the social \ninstitutions which they support’’ (Cohen 1966: 7). Interestingly, Cohen \nused the examples of marriage and family as two social institutions that \nhave found it necessary to tolerate minor indiscretions—such as \npremarital and extra- marital sex—in order to preserve their \nattractiveness, not to mention their integrity. \nOver the past three decades, gays and lesbians worldwide have \nconfronted societal norms surrounding ‘‘traditional’’ notions of marriage \nand family—not only by raising families of their own, but by demanding \ntheir right to marry one another. Presently, in the United States, same-\nsex marriage is legal in Washington, DC and 14 of the 50 states; globally, \ngays and lesbians have secured marriage rights in 15 countries 4; and, in \nmany other countries (e.g., the United Kingdom), same-sex couples have \nestablished similar rights through civil unions or partnerships. While from \na civil rights perspective these advances may be a cause ce´le`bre, it is \nnevertheless important to consider whether the same-sex marriage \ndebate has forced some gay men to question their ability to enter into \nand/or commit to these formerly ‘‘out-of-bound’’ institutions. \nAccording to Cohen, in societies where pre-arranged marriages are \ncustomary, assurances related to sex and sexual variety are not always \nguaranteed. If we thus take the view that marriage is a form of symbolic \n‘‘pre-arrangement’’ for the entire community of gay men, is it not possible \nthat at least some men might experience a pressure they had not \npreviously anticipated? Or, to put it another way, poised on the eve of \ntheir ability to marry—could some men be experiencing a case of the pre-\nmarital ‘‘jitters’’? If so, what we may, in fact, be witnessing, at least with \nrespect to some of the newer forms of gay drug- and sex-related \ndeviance and transgression—bug-chasing, conversion parties, increased \n‘‘party drug’’ usage, extreme porn websites, hidden sex webcams, \nwebcam injection drug experiences—is the equivalent of an all-too-\nfamiliar scene that occurs for many hetero- sexual bachelors on the eves \nof their weddings: a global gay ‘‘stag party.’’ \n \nConclusion \n \nFrom a Western legal and criminological perspective, one’s sexual \nidentity—whether they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or \nqueer—is no longer considered deviant, much less a crime. Nonetheless, \n \n \n4 Presently, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, \nIceland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South \nAfrica, Sweden, Uruguay have passed legislation granting the right for \nsame-sex couples to wed. \n all persons are capable of engaging in crimes and/or deviant behaviors. \nGay men are no exception. The focus of this article was not on gay \ncriminality, though—the reasons gay men commit crimes may be the \nsame or similar to the reasons others commit crimes: praise, poverty, \nself-preservation, etc. Rather, the purpose of this article was to discuss \nseveral perspectives that might be useful for criminological inquiries of \ncontemporary forms of gay deviance and transgression related to drug-\ntaking and ‘‘risky’’ sex practices. \nOf course, focusing on gay drug-driven sex behaviours runs the risk of \nperpetuating overly sexualized images of gay men (and perhaps of the \nLGBTQ community as a whole). Nonetheless, there is an abundance of \nnon-criminological research concerning gay drug usage and sex \npractices that can serve as a good starting point for criminologists. Such \nstudies typically conclude that gay drug- and sex-related behaviors are \nrelated to the labeling and stigmatization experiences suffered upon \nsexual minorities by Western heteronormative societies. While these \nperspectives may be suitable in some instances, it is important to also \nconsider that not all gay men have experienced stigma related to their \nsexuality. Certainly, some gay men may engage in drug- and sex-related \nbehaviors for reasons that are entirely different than those that drive \nother gay men to perform the same acts. Furthermore, not all gay \ntransgression takes the same forms—indeed, gay men can (and do) \nengage in criminal or deviant behaviors that are entirely unrelated to sex \nor illicit drugs. \nGay resistance to heteronormativity was also discussed as a contributing \nfactor for some forms of gay deviance and transgression. However, gay \nmen, in general, have experienced a recent leveling off of institutional \nand societal discrimination, and—at least in Western secular societies—\nthe gay rights movement is well-poised to continue this trend, especially \nin the area of same-sex marriage. It is suggested, then, that gay \ncounternormativity is no longer exclusively tied to resisting heterosexual \nideals related to identity, love and sex. Indeed, there are perhaps \nnumerous gay drug and sex subcultures that have developed in \nresponse to homonormative ideals concerning these very same issues, \nas well. \nCultural criminology offers several explanations for criminal, deviant, or \ntransgressive behaviors that arise out of processes related to cultural \ninclusion and/or social exclusion. \n \nHowever, because not all gay deviance and transgression is attributable \nto LGBTQ social exclusion, it is thus suggested that at least some of \nthese behaviors might be related to recent LGBTQ social inclusion. For \nsome gay men, drug- and sex-related deviance and transgression may \nthus be linked to a new type of struggle—one that is related to a decision \nwhether to adopt (and comply) with emerging homonormative norms, \nvalues and rules, or—as with the past struggle against \n heteronormativity—to reject them. \n \nAcknowledgments: The author would like to thank the faculty, staff and \ncandidates of the Erasmus Mundus Doctorate in Cultural and Global \nCriminology (DCGC) for their wisdom, guidance and support, as well as \nthe On˜ati International Institute for the Sociology of Law, the University \nof Kent at Paris, and Columbia University’s Reid Hall in Paris for their \ngenerous provision of office space during this project.

    "abstract": "Cultural criminology suggests that crime, deviance, and transgression are often subcultural in nature. For this reason, cultural criminologists often focus on the simultaneous forces of cultural inclusion and social exclusion when explaining criminal, deviant,or transgressive behaviors. This is a particularly useful bricolage for examining contemporary gay deviance and transgression—behaviors that are perhaps closely linked to (if not directly caused by) the past isolation, marginalization and/or oppression of homosexuals by Western heteronormative societies. It is also useful for understanding behaviors that are the result of marginalization and oppression from other sources, namely, the gay community itself. Using subcultural theories of deviance—such as those favored by cultural criminologists—this article explores a perspective that can be used for exploring certain forms of gay deviance and transgression. First, some of the more ostensible criminological theories that satisfy a prima facie criminological inquiry will be presented and critiqued:\\ud\nlabeling and stigma, and resistance to heteronormativity. To these will be added a new and potentially productive way of thinking that takes into consideration rule-breaking as a form of resistance to homonormative norms, values and rules",
