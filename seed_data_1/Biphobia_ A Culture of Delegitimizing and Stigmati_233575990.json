Student Research Awards. 7.\nhttp://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/awards/7\n           5/20/17 \n  \nBiphobia \nA CULTURE OF DELEGITIMIZING AND STIGMATIZING BISEXUALITY \nANGELICA WHITEHORNE \n 2 \n \nThe LGBT community has made great strides in the U.S. in the past couple of \nyears. The group is increasing its visibility in society through media and protests, \ndemanding that they deserve “equal dignity in the eyes of the law” (Vogue, Diamond- \nCNN). The Marriage Act which was passed on June 26th, 2015 was a huge success in \nthis battle of equality, making same-sex marriage legal and bringing justice to couples \nwho could previously be refused legal matrimony (Vogue, Diamond- CNN). In addition \nto legal feats, LGBT populations are expressing pride with marches in many major cities \nincluding Brockport’s neighbors, Buffalo and Rochester. The growing advocacy groups \nboth on college campuses and in the wider community have also been on the rise. \nDespite these advances the LGBT community still face discrimination and \nunacceptance from some populations. This depicts that there are still issues burdening \nthis minority. One issue remaining is pertaining to the subgroup of bisexuals in the \nLGBT community. Bisexual individuals are still fighting for visibility and acceptance from \nboth heterosexual and homosexual populations. This group’s deviance from singular \ngendered attraction often results in discrimination from both monosexual populations. \nThe stigmas surrounding bisexuality as a “transitory phase” or promiscuous sexuality \ninvalidates their identity and denies the existence of fluid sexualities (Brewster,16). \nBisexuality refers to the erotic, emotional, or sexual attractions to persons of \nmore than one gender (Brewster, 12).  Bisexuality can be seen from early human \nhistory.  From Horace, a poet from the first century B.C.E to the Greek God Hercules to \npolitical figures like Julius Caesar in 44 BC.  From then on it has reoccurred throughout \nhumanity to modern day celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Frank Ocean (Famous \nBisexuals). In addition to their longevity, bisexual individuals make up more than half of \n 3 \nthe LGBT population (LGBTmap, 5). If bisexuality has been expressed for this long of a \ntime and constitutes so much of the LGBT community then why are they still suffering \nfrom invisibility?  It could be the sexuality’s refusal to adhere to one gender romantically \nthat threatens both of the monosexual populations. Bisexual’s fluidity makes it harder to \nrelate to either monosexual populations decreasing the amount of support and \nacceptance they receive from either group (Brewster, 16). One example of this \nexclusion is that in the previously mentioned feat of pride marches bisexuality has never \nreceived a specific march for their own representation. Although that is changing this \nyear with Tel Avid, a pride parade in Israel, it is still a long history with no grand scale \nparade recognition (LGBT weekly).  The fact that it has taken until 2017 for bisexual \nindividuals to receive their own pride march shows that bisexuality is marginalized in \neven the LGBT community. \nBiphobia can be defined as “the negative attitudes, behaviors, and structures \nspecifically directed toward anyone who is attracted to more than one gender” (The \nBisexuality Report, 19).  As previously stated this negativity is not relegated to \nstemming from only heterosexual people. Although just as with the rest of the LGBT \ncommunity, “bisexual’s face heteronormativity or the wider societal assumption that \nheterosexuality is the normal way of being,” the “negative backlash” towards their \nidentity can be received from the homosexual community. This is labeled as a “double \ndiscrimination” and makes it harder for bisexual people to find a community in which \nthey are accepted (The Bisexuality Report, 18).  \nThere are an abundance of stereotypes and stigmatizations surrounding \nbisexuality that contribute to biphobia. Bisexual people face judgment for defining \n 4 \nthemselves outside of the romantic gender norm. Bisexuals in a hetero, monogamous \nrelationship are assumed to be straight while those with same sex partners are thought \nto be in “denial of their homosexuality” (Brewster, 13). Bisexuality is delegitimized by the \naccusations that they are simply confused about their sexuality (Brewster, 15). Although \nlesbian, gay, and straight people may experiment with both genders before labeling \ntheir sexuality it is offensive to make bisexuality synonymous with experimentation. \nWhen bisexuality is equated with a kind of sexual confusion it is devaluing the fact that \nsome people experience attraction outside of the monosexual norm. It also creates the \nnotion that bisexuality is not a permeant and adequate sexuality to hold, another huge \ndiscrimination to those who identify with it.  \nThere is also a stigma that a bisexual identity makes an individual unfit for \nrelationships or naturally more promiscuous (Brewster, 13). Stereotyping one sexuality \nas “incapable of monogamy” because of their fluidity for partners is a hateful \nassumption that damages the reputation of individuals solely off of a stereotype. One \nexample of this is the intense sexualizing bisexuality faces from the porn industry. In \nrelation to female bisexuals in particular, the fetishizing of women engaging in sexual \nacts with a multitude of genders is related back to bisexuality. While this a scripted \ninteraction that is not affiliated with the actualities of being bisexual the description of \nthe content can include this identity as a way to entice certain crowds. (The Bisexuality \nReport, 20).  When bisexuality is fetishized or used as prop for porn it not only \nreinforces the promiscuous stereotypes but also detracts from its creditability as real \nsexuality and not a sexualized practice. In addition to this, bisexual people are also \nseen as more likely to carry an STD which could also stem from the stereotypes \n 5 \nassociated with porn. Lastly, they are classified as greedy for not adhering to a sole \ngender of partners. These aggressive stereotypes have no foundation as there is no \nproof that bisexual individuals are less monogamous than other sexualities (The \nBisexuality Report, 20). Therefore, the stigma serves to once again delegitimize \nbisexuality and construct it as a sinful sexuality. The negative stereotypes are an \ninjustice to a group who already struggles to be accepted or validated. All of the most \ncommon stereotypes associated with bisexuality are meant to demine or demonize the \nsexuality something that is common rhetoric for the rest of the LGBT community. \nHowever, the bisexual stereotypes remain unaddressed contributing to this group’s \ninvisibility and lack of support. \nThe stigmas surrounding bisexuals can have a negative impact on their mental \nhealth and become “detrimental” for healthy relationships (Brewster, 20). One \nexperiment held by a scientist named Meyer concluded that the “expectation of stigma \nwas related positively with several indicators of psychological distress” (Brewster, 22-\n23).  The constant worrying of whether their bisexuality, an inherent and natural part of \ntheir identity, will be accepted is so intense that many individuals experience mental \ndistress. The misinterpreting and stigmatizing of their sexuality can put bisexuals at a \nhigher risk for mental illness. Again since the prejudice is received from both \nhomosexual and heterosexual populations the disorders attributed to prejudice is \nincreased among these individuals. (Brewster, 14). Some of the associated illnesses \ninclude “demoralization (sadness, dread, anxiety, helplessness, low self esteem, \nconfused thinking), guilt, and, suicidal ideation/intent” (Brewster, 23-24). In addition to \nthese aliments bisexuals are also found to have “higher rates of anxiety” and an \n 6 \n“increased self conscious” (Brewster, 17). Most concerning is the higher risk of suicide \nattempts amongst bisexuals, one experiment reported that they were 4 times more likely \nto attempt suicide than straight adults. (LGBTmap, 3 \nThe studies show that being bisexual often takes an unhealthy toll on an \nindividual’s mental state. It is a disgrace in itself that identifying as a certain sexuality \ncomes with “psychological consequences” however, the fact that bisexuals have to deal \nwith these consequences with little awareness being brought to the issues is why the \npopulation is suffering from feelings of invalidation (Brewster, 17).  Being excluded from \nthe heteronormative culture as well as the gay and lesbian culture can isolate bisexuals \nand perpetuate the pattern of mental illness. Although more bisexuals suffer from \nmental illnesses they are less likely to come out to their health care providers. Fearful of \nstigmas against bisexual people they often withhold the information about their \norientation that could help to treat their mental illnesses perpetuating the problem \nfurther.  \nBiphobia also occurs within the workplace creating another space of \ndiscrimination for the orientation. Bisexuals have a disportionately higher rate of poverty \nand unemployment than other sexualities. A quarter of bisexual men live in poverty \ncompared to only 15% of heterosexual and 20% of gay men. This number increases for \nbisexual women at 30% compared to 21% for straight women and 23% for gay women \n(LGBTmap, 2). These statistics display that bisexual people have a harder time gaining \nfinancial success or receiving employment. This sad fact could be attributed to factors \nsuch as discrimination or mental illness stemming from the repercussions of their \norientation. For those who are offered employment, they continue to face discrimination. \n 7 \nAlmost half of bisexual people have not disclosed their sexuality to their coworkers and \n60% have reported hearing bisexual based jokes while in a work environment \n(LGBTmap, 2). Again these negative experiences lead to feelings of worthlessness and \nexclusion that are detrimental to the health of bisexuals.  \nViolence is also committed at a higher rate towards bisexuals. In a staggering \npercentage 46% of bisexual women have been raped compared to 13% of lesbian \nwomen and 17% of straight women. This statistic shows that bisexual women are \napproximately three times more likely to get raped than other women (LGBTmap, 2). \nThe factors behind this increase could possibly be linked to the orientation’s sexualized \nstereotypes or the otherwise negative emotions surrounding the sexuality that spurs on \nhate crimes. Whatever the cause the statistics depicts an extremely disadvantaged \nsection of the LGBT community and calls for an increased awareness for the violence \nbisexuals face in order to combat it in the future.   \nDespite the continued invisibility of bisexuality, it has begun to make a rise in \npopular culture. Countless celebrities are identifying as bisexual. Stars such as Cara \nDelevingne, Miley Cyrus, Frank Ocean, and Angelina Jolie all have publicly come out as \nbisexual to millions of fans. Celebrities are often questioned about their sexuality as if \nthis private and deeply personal aspect of self should be forced into the public sphere. \nThe upside to these invasions is that many celebrities have become pioneers for \ndismantling the prominent bisexual invisibility seen in modern culture. Like with anything \nelse young people look to celebrities to help them navigate their formative years, \nlooking up to them as role models and learning from their example. When celebrities \nstand firm in their identity they help to validate and bring awareness to the sexuality. In \n 8 \nthe past few years, there seems to be a new norm among celebrities to share their \nsexuality. Although it does not detract from the stigmas surrounding it, normalizing the \nsexuality through announcing it as a prideful part of your identity to a limitless audience \ndoes empower a marginalized group. \nCelebrities are often noted for bringing attention to their cause and bisexual \ncelebrities are no different. Anna Paquin from True Blood was quoted saying, \"for me, \nit’s [bisexuality] not really an issue because I’m someone who believes being bisexual is \nactually a thing. It’s not made up. It’s not a lack of decision” (Huffington Post).  \nCelebrities may appear to be fearless in their approaches to coming out but it is \nstill a sensitive and risky action for their career. The first famous rapper to make public \nhis feelings of sexual attraction to both genders on such a large scale was Frank \nOcean. His newest release “Slide” features the lyric “I see both sides like Chanel” \nsymbolizing his bisexuality. However, his coming out did not occur without trepidation. \nHe said himself that “you worry about people in the business who you’ve heard talk that \nway.” This quote alludes to the homophobic and/or biphobic comments he has heard in \nthe business. He goes on to discuss how he rejects labels and has contemplated \nwhether the coming out letter he posted would affect his career (Huffington Post).  The \nfreedom of sexuality he expressed took faith in his fans not to discriminate against him \nfor his identity. Coming out as bi in a genre of music that bases its success off the \nsexual conquer of females was a revolutionary action. Incorporating his sexual identity \ninto lyrics that now stray from the intensely heteronormative content creates a space for \nbisexuality in the genre. Frank Ocean’s publicity proves to be a positive example of \ncelebrities bringing attention and acceptance to bisexuality.  \n 9 \nFrank Ocean’s coming out culminated in positive attention for the bisexual \ncommunity. However, other celebrities have been questioned to identify as bisexual \nsimply to bring attention to their personal lives. Nothing can be proven around whether \nan individual is labeling themselves for identity purposes or for their image. Since \nbisexuality is seen as a rebellion or as a wild sexuality a lot of young stars can be seen \nas very vocal about their multi-gendered relationships. In tabloids there is often stories \nabout stars possibly being bisexual and often these stories are accompanied by visuals \nthat depict said star as ‘spiraling out of control’. The media’s portrayal of young people \nexperimenting with their sexuality brings negative attention to the bisexual community \nand reinforces the malignant stereotypes. When celebrities seem to exploit these \nimages to further their public persona it is disrespectful to those struggling to be \naccepted for their identity.  \n One quote from David Bowie says \"it's true -- I am a bisexual. But I can't deny \nthat I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\" \nThis quote portrays the complex relationship between celebrities and coming out as \nbisexual. Unlike those without fame celebrities can utilize the wild stigma of bisexuality \nto construct for themselves the kind of persona that gives celebrities more attention. \nWith David Bowie his bisexuality was a legitimate aspect of his identity but he does \nrecognize the way in which it inevitably affected his career and persona.  \n It is possible that celebrities building their famous persona’s either around or \nincluding bisexuality in itself doesn’t have to be inherently negative. Perhaps the \nmedia’s portrayal of bisexuality as promiscuous, confused, or overtly sexualized is a \nslight of the media and not the celebrity. Perhaps the notion that celebrities use the \n 10 \nsexuality to gain attention is another fundamental condemnation of both the celebrities \nand the sexuality in itself. Bowie says he benefitted from the attention he received from \ncoming out as bi or being other wise ambiguous with his sexuality but the bi community \nalso benefited from it. One Bowie fan commented “I cannot quantify precisely the effect \nhe has had on the increasing visibility of gay and trans peoples throughout the world, \nbut there are few figures, at least in the influential world of pop culture, that I’d give \nmore credit to for expanding the boundaries of what we think of as beautiful” (Wicks). \nThe support and recognition Bowie advocated for through his performances, art, and \nselfhood made being bisexual or outside the labels of society more acceptable. He \ndecreased the invisibility of bisexuals and normalized a more fluid sexuality. One should \nnot detract from his advocacy because of the boost his career received from his \ncommitment to his sexuality. \nThe ideals of what sexuality should be is forced upon bisexual individuals. The \nlack of support and understanding most bisexuals receive for their identity causes \nmental aliments and sometimes physical damage to the individual. The double \ndiscrimination forced upon bisexuals creates a “monosexual privilege” for straight, \nlesbian, and gay populations. This means that the monosexual populations need to \nformulate strategies to become better allies for bisexuals. Not enforcing detrimental and \ninsubstantial stereotypes is the first way allies can help bisexuals feel validated. Next \nthere needs to be more attention given to the hardships bisexuals specifically face and \nmovements to makes sure bisexuality doesn’t get lost in the LGBT acronym. Lastly, \nmonosexuals can utilize their privilege to open their minds and support more fluid \nsexualities, recognizing that it is as valid and concrete of a sexuality as their own. These \n 11 \nsteps would eventually ease the biphobia expressed in our society and create a more \ndiverse and accepting atmosphere.  \nIn conclusion, the stigmas surrounding bisexuality for not adhering to a single \ngendered attraction is a form of delegitimizing the identity with negative associations. By \nlabeling bisexuals as promiscuous, confused, or sexual experimenters it devalues the \nsexualities respectable and natural existence. The mental and physical repercussions of \nthese biases prove the detrimental effects these stigmas and exclusion have on the bi \ncommunity. The recent LGBT legal advances and the awareness brought to the \nsexuality through celebrities has helped to decrease its invisibility however there needs \nto be more positive awareness brought to the sexuality. With the assistance of allies \nand advocacy the bi community can debunk the negative stereotypes and explain the \nlegitimacy of their sexuality and in return receive the respect their orientation deserves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 \nWorks Cited \nBarker, Meg, et al.
