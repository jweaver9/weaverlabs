Hyperloop is meant to improve public transit and could potentially move at hundreds of miles per hour, according to the SpaceX website.A working prototype for Hyperloop has not yet been achieved, but a team of roughly 50 UT students attempted to de-sign a pod for transpor-tational use. Their team, 512 Hyperloop, found out last week they would be one of 24 teams in the final round of the SpaceX CAMPUSJefferson Davis statue moves to BriscoeCourtesy of The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History Students gather around the newly refurbished Jefferson Davis statue Saturday at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. By Anusha Lalani@anusha_lalaniAt 8 feet, 6 inches tall, the refurbished and con-troversial Jefferson Da-vis statue reached its final destination at the Dolph Briscoe Center for Amer-ican History, returning to university grounds. After a restoration in Chi-cago, the statue is now a part of an exhibit displaying the statue’s history and its jour-ney to the Briscoe Center.“It used to be commem-orated — now it simply ex-ists as a teaching moment on campus,” said Benjamin Wright, assistant director for communications at the Briscoe Center. “It’s here to educate students and schol-ars and indeed any member of the public who’s interested on how UT’s changed over the last 80 or so years.”The statue was part of numerous protests and van-dalizations in 2015. This led to the formation of a task force that looked at the re-percussions of removing the statue, leaving the final de-cision to President Gregory Fenves. It was later removed in August from the Main Mall, along with the stat-ue of former U.S. President Woodrow Wilson.  “Davis had few ties to Tex-as. He played a unique role in the history of the American South that is best explained and understood through an educational exhibit,” Fenves said in a statement in 2015. “The Briscoe Center is the logical location for the DAVIS page 2UNIVERSITYUT releases plan to create diversity, inclusion policiesDIVERSITY page 3By Rachel Cooper@rachelcoopaRecruiting a more diverse campus community, invest-ing in more student housing and increasing housing ac-commodations for disabled and LGBTQ students are just three of 48 goals from the University’s newly re-leased Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan.The plan, released on March 30, was created in an effort to increase and pro-mote diversity throughout the University.UT President Gregory Fenves announced the de-velopment of the plan in his 2016 State of the University Address in September. Fenves shared the plan in an email to the University as a solution to one of the “many challenges” facing the world and UT.  “The core purpose of the University of Texas at Austin is to transform lives for the benefit of society,” Fenves said in an email. “We cannot carry out that purpose until every person in our community is included and treated equitably. This plan is a step toward that goal, but there is much work to be done if we are to ensure our future progress.”According to a universi-ty press release, the plan was developed over the past six months by Gregory Vincent, vice president for diversi-ty and community engage-ment; Soncia Reagins-Lilly, vice president for student affairs; and Maurie McInn-is, executive vice president and provost.Vincent said in an email that UT has made a lot of progress in the way of diversity but there are still areas that can be improved and challenges that come along with the plan.“Impacting campus climate and institutional culture and measuring that impact will be challenges but ones we are committing to with this plan,” Vincent said. “I always say that there are two institu-tions which look very much the same as they did hundreds of years ago — churches and CAMPUSNew on-campus arena to replace Erwin CenterSay goodbye to the Frank Erwin Center. Texas men and women’s basket-ball will have a new home in less than a decade.University President Gregory Fenves held a meeting with members of the University’s Develop-ment Board on Friday to discuss details of the pro-posed on-campus arena, which Fenves expects to be open in the next five to seven years.“The campus master plan, developed in 2012, called for the land under the Erwin Center to be used for future expan-sion of the Dell Medical School and the UT Health District,” Fenves said to the Development Board. “As we prepare for that, we will also ensure that our outstanding men’s and women’s basketball programs can continue to compete in a great arena.”The new arena’s layout and costs have not been released, but the location is fairly certain. Graph-ics released with Fenves’ statement show the new arena located directly south of Mike A. My-ers Stadium and directly east of the Recreational Sports Center — the ex-act location of what is currently a major source of daily parking for stu-dents with a class C per-mit, Lot 70.While day-to-day parking might get even more strenuous for Tex-as students, making it to both men’s and women’s basketball games won’t.

Zac CroffordRECYCLEyour copy ofDavis statue and can provide a well-curated, scholarly context for its permanent display.”Wright said the Briscoe Center is prepared for critics. “We’re interested in the truth and in displaying the truth and displaying the ev-idence of the past,” Wright said. “Any student who feels uncomfortable about the statue being here (should know) the statue is no lon-ger commemorated. It’s no longer in a place of honor. It exists as a piece of evidence in our historical exhibit.”Student Government passed a resolution sup-porting the removal of the statue in March 2015, led by former executive alliance candidates Xavier Rotnof-sky and Rohit Mandalapu, who made it a part of their campaign platform. “It started out as what we thought was an absurd promise,” Rotnofsky said. “More philosophical and morally, we thought it was ridiculous that we still had Confederate statues up.”Following another van-dalism to the statue in the summer of 2015, Rotnofsky was one of 12 members on the task force considering different options for the stat-ue. Rotnofsky said the task force wanted the statue to be contextualized and used for educational opportunities.When the Briscoe Center pitched their idea to the task force, Rotnofsky said it was a great idea.“It’s cool that it’s finally found a place,” Rotnofsky said. “I’d like to visit it next time I’m in Texas.”Public health sophomore Kayla Eboreime, political ac-tion chair for UT Black Stu-dent Alliance, said she sup-ports the statue’s placement in the Briscoe Center be-cause it will help people see how far the University has come in terms of diversity. “It’s important that we preserve our history, espe-cially because forgetting our history impacts how we’re treated in the future,” Ebore-ime said. “I’m really happy it was taken off of campus, because we need to be more diverse and I think having symbols that are racist and exclusive in nature don’t promote a healthy commu-nity for students to learn and grow.”The exhibit, From Com-memoration to Education: Pompeo Coppini’s Statue of Jefferson Da vis, and the entire museum opened Sat-urday for an open house after renovations were com-pleted and will be formally opened today.competition for university students this August. Aerospace engineering sophomore Sahar Rashed, electronics lead for the team, said the UT Hyper-loop pod design features more experimental tech-nology than some of the other teams’ designs. “To make it to the top 24 was not something that we were 100 percent sure we were going to make,” Rashed said. “We took some risks (with the  design) … and we were worried that SpaceX wouldn’t value the risks we took as much as we did.” Aerospace engineering junior Daniel Cha, ex-ternal vice president of 512 Hyperloop, said the unique design elements of the pod may be a re-sult of the demographics of the team, as the team is made almost entirely of undergraduate students.“Having a group of un-dergrad students brings innovation to our team,” Cha said. “They’re not very bound by what can work and what can not work, because we don’t know too much.”Though having a young-er group incites creative thinking, Rashed said the UT team is faced with dis-advantages as well. She said a lack of hands-on builders will complicate the work in the upcoming months. Team president Brian Poteet, a mechanical en-gineering senior, said a practical Hyperloop design might never become a re-ality, but the competition is still an important way for engineers to experiment with the concept. “It’s just a great way to both develop the technolo-gy and develop student de-sign skills,” Poteet said.There is no official ma-terial prize for the compe-tition, but SpaceX has ex-pressed the possibility that they will contract specific students from the event to work at the company, Rashed said. 512 Hyperloop is cur-rently in the recruiting process, and Poteet said he hopes the team will eventually grow to about 75 students.SPACEXcontinues from page 1Group sends care packages to victims of sexual assaultAustin combats rise in K2 overdosesInfographic by Megan McFarren | Daily Texan StaffAustin city leaders teamed up to crack down on the spread of K2 following an uptick in overdoses and hospitalizations in recent weeks.K2, also known as synthetic marijuana, is a blend of indus-trial chemicals most common-ly sprayed onto tobacco leaves and smoked. The drug has become a problem among the homeless population of down-town Austin in recent years because it is sold at extremely low prices on the street. Aus-tin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services responded to dozens of K2 calls almost every night in the past two weeks alone, according to regular up-dates on their Twitter page.Following this uptick, city leaders announced, in a joint press conference Thursday, a plan to create a multi-agency group that will provide en-forcement, substance abuse support and medical care to those affected by K2. The group will include members from the Austin Police Depart-ment, the Emergency Medical Services Department, Austin Public Health and Austin-Tra-vis County Integral Care.“The people that are prey-ing upon the homeless be-cause they are homeless de-serve to experience the fullest extent of our law enforcement and judicial system,” Mayor Steve Adler said at the press conference. “For those or-chestrating and profiting off this misery, I don’t know if there’s a special place in Hell for that, but there is definite-ly a place in prison with their name on it.”APD began increasing pa-trol officers around the Aus-tin Resource Center for the Homeless, an area high in K2 calls — with 17 arrests occur-ring near the shelter last Mon-day alone, according to APD. ATCEMS responded to over 5,000 K2-related calls between January 2012 and December 2016. Numbers have remained high since June 2015, when a record 406 K2-related calls occurred. This February, AT-CEMS responded to 307 inci-dents, or more than 10 per day, according to KEYE TV. K2 has been illegal in Texas since September 2015. How-ever, law enforcement officials are presented with another problem — because of the wide range of chemicals in each batch, K2 cannot be test-ed for in hospitals and instead, blood samples must be ana-lyzed in private labs.APD has issued 104 war-rants in the last year for K2 dealers, however, these war-rants are difficult to obtain. Since a blood sample can take three to sixth months to be an-alyzed, dealers are often out on the street long before a warrant is issued, said APD Assistant Chief Jason Dusterhoft. APD has started looking at contracting with outside labs to quicken this turn-around. In the meantime, enforcement efforts will continue to focus on K2 dealers instead of users, Dusterhoft said.“This is a crisis,” Dusterhoft said. “We’re looking at dealers who are preying on the most vulnerable of the Austin popu-lation.

It exists as a piece of evidence in our historical exhibit.”Student Government passed a resolution sup-porting the removal of the statue in March 2015, led by former executive alliance candidates Xavier Rotnof-sky and Rohit Mandalapu, who made it a part of their campaign platform. “It started out as what we thought was an absurd promise,” Rotnofsky said. “More philosophical and morally, we thought it was ridiculous that we still had Confederate statues up.”Following another van-dalism to the statue in the summer of 2015, Rotnofsky was one of 12 members on the task force considering different options for the stat-ue. Rotnofsky said the task force wanted the statue to be contextualized and used for educational opportunities.When the Briscoe Center pitched their idea to the task force, Rotnofsky said it was a great idea.“It’s cool that it’s finally found a place,” Rotnofsky said. “I’d like to visit it next time I’m in Texas.”Public health sophomore Kayla Eboreime, political ac-tion chair for UT Black Stu-dent Alliance, said she sup-ports the statue’s placement in the Briscoe Center be-cause it will help people see how far the University has come in terms of diversity. “It’s important that we preserve our history, espe-cially because forgetting our history impacts how we’re treated in the future,” Ebore-ime said. “I’m really happy it was taken off of campus, because we need to be more diverse and I think having symbols that are racist and exclusive in nature don’t promote a healthy commu-nity for students to learn and grow.”The exhibit, From Com-memoration to Education: Pompeo Coppini’s Statue of Jefferson Da vis, and the entire museum opened Sat-urday for an open house after renovations were com-pleted and will be formally opened today.universities.

Vincent said university lead-ership is also developing a timeline for the implementa-tions and some initiatives list-ed have already been done or are in the process of being put into action.Karla Chavez, Student Government Diversity and Inclusion Agency director, said the plan is a good proac-tive measure by the Universi-ty, but students should hold administrators accountable to fulfill these initiatives.    “This seems like a kind of transitive feature,” said Chavez, an international re-lations and global studies junior. “The student body, at least the student body from underrepresented communi-ties, they want something … now because this is recruit-ing faculty in the future. Well what about the needs that students have right now?” According to the press re-lease, the writers of the plan collaborated with universi-ty members including SG representatives. Chavez said she had not heard about the plan until she read the email from Fenves and she hopes administration reaches out to students for input and a more holistic approach. Vincent said the plan is designed to be modified ac-cording to the needs of the University.

Engineers for a Sustain-able World is a nationwide organization that promotes social and environmental prosperity through educa-tion, design and construc-tion. Out of its 50 collegiate chapters, UT is the only chapter to host the confer-ence for the second time since 2005. Conference chair Ananna Anu, a civil engineering se-nior, said choosing a theme for the conference was tricky.“Austin is known for its startup culture,” Anu said. “We chose the theme ‘ac-celerate’ to show how we can sustain these start-ups. Whether it’s on a per-sonal level or a corporate level, engineering is vital to sustainability.”Anu, a fourth-year mem-ber of the organization, said the event is an incredible learning opportunity.“We are not limited to one engineering major here,” Anu said. “I learn about cool industry innovations all the time, some of these innovations happened in industries that I didn’t even know existed.”Outside of students and professors, the con-ference also invited industry professionals. Andrew Johnston, direc-tor of Navigant Global En-ergy Practice, gave a keynote speech about collaboration within engineering.“There is a stereotype that engineers aren’t good at communicating with oth-ers,” said Johnston, a UT alumnus. “We are here to see what the next generation has to offer in terms of com-munication with govern-ment officials, students and citizens in order to provide more durable sustainable engineering practices.” Johnston said the an-nual conference showed him a reflection of engineering’s future.“It is good to see that the future of engineering is getting a tanner com-plexion and more women,” Johnson said. “The current engineering society is full of old, white males. The fu-ture brings a generational and cultural bridge to the professional field.” Architectural engineering sophomore Tiffany Tang said she enjoyed presenting solutions to environmental problems. Her group worked weekly on an aquatic engi-neering design that was pre-sented at the conference in a classroom setting.“Our jobs are very di-verse,” Tang said. “We maintain an aquatic system, check for the weather qual-ity, check for the fish and build structures for plants to grow.” Tang said the confer-ence has been an eye- opening experience.“It’s interesting to see what people are doing in other schools,” Tang said. “The di-versity here in demography and ideas is what makes the conference so interesting.”By Ashley Liu@ashley_liu111Texas Blazers continues fight against rape cultureJustin Atkinson, com-mittee leader of the Men-CanEnd campaign, be-lieves 90 percent of the University’s effort to end campus sexual assault is female and victim-ori-ented, whereas only 10 percent is directed to-ward the prevention of sexual assault.“The energy should be going into giving educa-tion on how to navigate healthy sexual relation-ships,” government senior Atkinson said. “We can tell women to walk in packs and use rape whistles all day, but the problem won’t be solved until we can teach men how to behave. It’s not one or the other, it should be a 50-50 mix.”MenCanEnd is a student initiative launched by the Texas Blazers that aims to promote healthy masculin-ity while combating rape culture on college campus-es. Originally intended as a temporary project, the ini-tiative garnered significant interest and became a per-manent committee within Texas Blazers.Atkinson said the high occurrence of sexual as-sault between UT students, shown by the recently re-leased Cultivating Learn-ing and Safe Environments survey, is perpetrated by the “stranger myth” in rape culture, which prevents self-reflection among male students.“Mainstream media always portrays rape as strangers in the bushes,” Atkinson said. “In reality, 90 percent of the victims are raped by someone they know. This creates a good-guy-bad-guy dichot-omy that allows people to distance themselves and say that ‘I’m a good guy, I would never do that.’”According to the CLASE survey, only 1 percent of rape victims have reported to the UT Police Department. “I wonder if it’s because the police has a mascu-line overtone that make victims less inclined to report.” Atkinson said. “But rape is about the loss of power, and under Title IX, the University’s duty is to help victims restore their sense of self-power and agency.”Astronomy freshman Yasmine Kem said she hopes the University takes more preemptive action against sexual assault.“We hear survivor sto-ries way more often than we hear about the after-math of the offender,” Kem said. “This one-sided lens places the burden of the tragedy on the women rather than the man. We need to make the offend-ers carry the weight, not the victims.”Kem said the school should use education as its main tactic in preventing sexual assault.“We don’t necessarily have to shame every male student on campus,” Kem said. “But they should rec-ognize that everyone has a responsibility in prevent-ing sexual assault. The best way in achieving that is through education and raising awareness.”By Ashley Liu@ashley_liu111CAMPUSBy Jenan Taha@jenan_a_tahaA newly formed student group on campus helps comfort sexual assault sur-vivors by sending them do-nations and kits filled with clothing items, toiletries and notes of support while they’re in the hospital.Strengthening Sleeping Beauty was created last se-mester by two UT students, who said the goal of the organization is to provide survivors with clothing and other necessities through donation drives.“A lot of times, when people go to the hospi-tal to be medically treated for rape or sexual assault, all their possessions are taken, even their clothes,” said co-founder Emma Robertson, a sociocul-tural anthropology and Mandarin sophomore. The organization had its first donation drop-off in late March at the Eloise House and SafePlace, shel-ters that offer survivors resources such as forensic exams and housing.“I’ve had (a) past with sexual assault, and so it was just really heavy on my heart to help the campus and the community of Aus-tin in a way that supports survivors,” Robertson said. “Because of our partner-ship, Eloise House is able to take the cost of clothing out of their budget and focus on staffing their clinic with qualified nurses and culti-vating a comforting envi-ronment for them to begin the process of healing.”Unlike other cam-pus groups that ed-ucate students about sexual violence, Strength-ening Sleeping Beauty is the only group that fo-cuses on the aftermath of a sexual assault rather than prevention.“As much as we preach consent and prevention, it’s still going to happen,” Robertson said. “We need to make sure that there’s people intervening and also need to take care of these people.”The organization was in-spired by a similar group in California, and adver-tised their donation drives through Facebook, the co-founders said.“We were just so excited that so many people with-in a few minutes were just as excited about making this impact as we were,” said co-founder Abigail Wiedenhoefer, interna-tional relations and global studies sophomore.Strengthening Sleep-ing Beauty is currently working on reaching more students and hospitals, as well as spreading aware-ness about sexual violence and how to treat survivors.“Everyone including us needs to be educated about how to help these survi-vors as best as possible,” Robertson said.Ami Artiz, Middle East-ern studies sophomore and member of the group, said the kits let survivors know that there are people who care for them.“The kits are a symbol that rape is not your fault,” Artiz said. “You shouldn’t feel broken or alone when going through a recovery process.”Artiz said she has ex-perienced sexual assault before and wants to help others going through sim-ilar hardships. Artiz said she is concerned about the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.“I’m sick of it. We all should be. It’s unaccept-able,” Artiz said. “I think I have an obligation to help other women and men.” The group has partnered with Minority Women Pursuing Law and Texas Lassos to get more students involved and plans to con-tinue gathering donations for their upcoming drop-off event this May.Group sends care packages to victims of sexual assaultFridays at 5 p.m.Listen to The Daily Texan newscastCAMPUSThe ‘SURE’ in SURE Walk stands for Students United for Rape Elimination. Originally created in 1982, SURE Walk has, unsurprisingly, seen a huge increase in requests for late-night security since the tragic murder of Haruka Weiser. But SURE Walk’s current lack of written pro-cedures and Student Government’s oversight have struggled to keep up with both the pro-gram’s growth and current information about the way sexual assaults happen to UT students. Public relations freshman Lauren Hooper was one of many UT students participating in RoundUp activities when she encountered a girl at high risk of sexual assault and alcohol poison-ing. “This girl could barely walk, she could bare-ly talk, she could barely stand,” Hooper said. “I feel very positive that, if I hadn’t helped her, something bad would have happened to her.”Hooper called SURE Walk, “because I know that’s the campus thing to get home safely.” But when the golf cart arrived, Hooper was shocked at the volunteer’s refusal to transport the inebriated student. They said she was too much of a liability, and suggested Hooper ei-ther call the police or an expensive ride share. Then the volunteers left to take another call. Not wanting to get the student in trouble, Hooper personally paid for a ride share to take the girl back to her dorm. Hooper isn’t mad at the volunteers — “they’re also trying to do the best they can,” she said — but nev-ertheless felt understandably upset that the policy wasn’t clear from the beginning.“There’s a lot of misconception and there is a need for this to either be cleared up or for something to change,” said Hooper. “I proba-bly won’t use SURE Walk again.” UT’s Student Amnesty for Drug and Alcohol related emergencies policy means that neither Hooper nor the student she was trying to help would face disciplinary action for calling UT Police Department, but SURE Walk’s volunteers’ failure to share this created an unsafe situation. In fact, the few online sources about SURE Walk do not mention restrictions on services, and do not include any information on UT’s Amnesty Policy. This is not the only communication fail-ure from the SURE Walk program. While UT staff in Parking and Transportation Ser-vices and the Office of Student Conduct were helpful and open about explaining policies and practices for this column, top SG offi-cers met questions about SURE Walk with hostility, and in one case, an open refusal to answer questions. When asked about restrictions on SURE Walk use, former SG Chief of Staff, Isaiah Carter, di-rected attention away from the program, and laid the blame at the feet of individual students. “I would tell any student who finds concern that it is important to have a plan if you are going far away from home and planning to get drunk,” wrote Carter in an email.Carter’s response reveals a complete lack of awareness of the way college drinking culture can lead to dangerous situations. It also com-pletely disregards recent statistics surround-ing situations in which sexual assault hap-pens. No one plans to be sexually assaulted or to be stranded without a way to get home. SURE Walk may even be a common plan for a safe ride home, because its zone of op-eration covers West Campus. This service is even more vital because a Cultivating Learn-ing and Safe Environments study shows sexu-al assault is most likely to happen off campus. Carter also misrepresented SG’s role in training volunteers, first telling me that was “a question for PTS.” But Jeremy Hernandez, with PTS, said in an email that “Student Gov-ernment handles the coordination of all vol-unteers. We are not able to comment.” Hernandez referred me back to Carter, who, when asked to clarify about volunteer orientation, refused to answer. “I don’t have time to do all of this for an opinion article,” he said in an email, despite having done multiple interviews about SURE Walk with news sources from UT and other organiza-tions in the past. If a program specifically working for rape elimination is not serving the most at-risk pop-ulation, that policy needs to be made abundant-ly clear so that students like Lauren Hooper, try-ing to prevent a possible sexual assault, are not left in a lurch when they seek services. Hooper’s experience should not have hap-pened. “Our policy is not to refuse rides to individuals that need them from and to cam-pus,” said SURE Walk director Krishan Sach-dev. “If the situation arises that we simply cannot accommodate a group of students we make sure that they get in contact with UTPD who will then provide them with a ride back home/to campus.” Sachdev also noted that orientation proce-dures have varied over semesters, but more importantly that there is no training manual or written policy for volunteer training.SURE Walk employees also do not have a written policy manual, but one is being cre-ated, Hernandez said. It is unclear whether a manual is being created for volunteers. While these may be effects of rapidly grow-ing demand, confused SURE Walk volunteers or employees create dangerous situations, such as the one Hooper found herself in. If SURE Walk really wants to accomplish the mission in its name, it needs to evaluate its policies and training, and become more ac-countable to the UT student body.

SURE Walk policies have recently caused confusion among students.A program at the University of Texas at Austin is hard at work protecting the citi-zens that the Trump administration is leav-ing behind, particularly transgender and non-binary students. UT’s Counseling and Mental Health Center provides a long list of services for all members of the UT commu-nity, but their services for trans and non-bi-nary students are particularly important at a point when their rights are under attack.In recent months, Texas has seen a bath-room bill that would force transgender peo-ple to use the bathroom corresponding to their biological sex as it is stated on their birth certificates, and no new protections have been instituted for transgender em-ployees. Because of these changes, a com-munity that is already often overlooked find themselves with far fewer options and friendly faces to turn to.Non-binary students, or those that feel as though they do not fit into either the tra-ditional male or female categories, have a whole different set of hurdles. Transgender issues have come into the spotlight with is-sues like the bathroom bill receiving cover-age, but many people don’t even know what it means to be non-binary. There are no specific protections for non-binary citizens other than those that are in place for other members of the LGBTQ community.However, the CMHC boasts more than 50 groups that are offered specifically for the LGBTQ community, according to as-sistant director Katy Redd. They also have several diversity coordinators on staff, and interested students can select a counselor based on a number of specifics like gender identity and cultural identity that may make them feel more comfortable. Young people often discover who they are and who they want to be in college, and without services like this they may be at a loss as to where to go for advice or help.In a year, the CMHC typically provides services to about 10 percent of the student population. For the LGBTQ population there are a number of therapy groups and the ability to meet with staff members, in-cluding psychologist and diversity coordi-nator Joey Hannah, who have specialized knowledge about gender, sexuality and di-versity. One of the great services for trans-gender and non-binary students offered is the ability to get a letter that can be used to begin transition care. That little piece of pa-per can act as armor to a person struggling with their identity and looking for a way for their outside to match their inside.For students that feel like Legislature is either ignoring them or, in some cases, at-tacking them, it is good to know that there is support — in walking distance, no less. Whether you are gay, straight, queer, or anything in between, there is a place to go. Even if all you need is someone to talk to, this program offers a place where you can be the real you. Bonfiglio is a journalism junior from Oak Creek, Colorado. 217 years ago, on April 10th, 1710, the Statute of Anne came into effect — creating a 14-year period of exclusive protection for the works of authors. The Statute of Anne is con-sidered the first copyright act in the world. The law itself was repealed 132 years later, but by that time its ideas had found their way into the U.S. Constitution’s Intellectual Property Clause. However, a combination of overzeal-ous protections and weak regulations have been detrimental to the American consumer.The pharmaceutical industry sits at the heart of most debates surrounding patent re-form. Companies spend an estimated $1.2 bil-lion to 1.8 billion to develop, test and market a single new drug. These are risky gambles. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s failed trial of a novel immunotherapy drug wiped out $20 billion worth of value from the company overnight. To shelter companies from the risk of fail-ure, Congress has provided strong intellec-tual property protections that severely limit competition. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 gives a five-year window of exclusive sales for brand name drugs. During this time the Food and Drug Administration is forbidden from approving any generic drugs which function similar to the brand name drug. On occa-sion, large pharmaceutical firms file lawsuits against companies in the process of develop-ing cheaper generic drugs. Under the provi-sions of the act a lawsuit keeps the exclusivity window open for another 30 months. In a last ditch effort to lock out compe-tition brand name drug manufacturers are blatantly refusing to cooperate with generics. Under a 2009 law, any generic or biosimilar drug seeking approval after the exclusivity period lapsed could do so by simply proving chemical similarity to the preexisting brand name drug. This allowed new drugs to rely upon a proven body of evidence for approv-al and makes new drugs safer. However, to prove this similarity the FDA must have samples of the original and new drug for comparison. In this brand name firms have proven to be difficult to work with, refusing to provide samples or develop risk mitiga-tion strategies required by law.Drug monopolies are formed by these pol-icies, and consumers bear the brunt of un-reasonably high prices. The tactics used by medical companies to shut out generics com-petition are estimated to cost consumers $3.5 billion a year. Moreover, ill-thought-out regulation has created trouble after generic drugs are ap-proved by creating exclusive 180-day mar-keting windows for the first generic drug approved. Moreover, the original manufac-turer of the brand name drug has a special “fast-track” to the generic drug approval. The impact is nearly identical to the brand name drug monopolies. Markets become winner-take-all and gray-market monopo-lies develop around older drugs — most no-table in the 500 percent increase in the price of EpiPens over seven years. The drugs peo-ple desperately need are costing them more than they should. The current legislation regulating big pharma was born of compromise and lob-byists and is woefully inadequate in ad-dressing the fundamental issues plaguing the industry. The courts have taken positive steps toward deeming pay-for-delay tactics as deserving antitrust scrutiny. However, the legal loopholes of the Hatch-Waxman Act must be closed. Exclusivity windows should be extended on a case-by-case basis in the instance of lawsuits and the fast-track original manu-facturers hold for generics approval needs to be revoked. Fairer pricing is more likely to occur when competitors stand on a level playing field. Finally, the cooperation be-tween generics and brand name drugs to prove similarity was addressed by the CRE-ATES Act of 2016 before it died in commit-tee. Congress must take up similar legis-lation again this session and pass it. These steps will provide proper protections to the American people while balancing the pro-tection of intellectual property.Patent protections are critical to respect innovators, but the inadequacy of current regulation is poised to stifle innovation. The concept of intellectual property must be up-dated from its 1710 origin.Hasan is a business freshman from Plano.COLUMNCMHC provides necessary resources for LGBTQ studentsGabriel Lopez| Daily Texan file photoCars park in front of the Student Services Building  on Dean Keeton, which houses UT’s Counseling and Mental Health Center.

Next to the host stand at a restaurant on Austin’s Fifth Street sits a stuffed bear by the name of Misha wear-ing a USSR-era ushanka and a tight white “Keep Austin Russian” t-shirt. Considered representative of the resilience of the Rus-sian spirit, the bear is just one of many cultural peculiarities that Russian House offers. Established in October 2012, and currently managed by Ro-man Butvin, Russian House is an eatery and bar opened by a couple from Moscow who sought to bring authen-tic Eastern European cuisine to Austin. “They desired to bring a positive representation of Rus-sia to the States,” Butvin said. “They thought a culturally ac-tive place like Austin was the perfect fit.”To bring Russian culture to Austin, they decided to reflect Russian culture in its entirety — contemporary and tradi-tional. Different areas of the restaurant are modeled after varying Russian time periods. “The front room for large parties is fashioned in tradi-tional folk style and the front bar is a showcase for local live Russian music,” Butvin said. “The dining area is meant to resemble old Babushka’s house in the early 20th century. There are some private rooms in the back that are like private Russian apartments.”The attention to detail in portraying Russian culture has left patrons with more than just a typical dining experience. The front of the house displays Soviet-era décor such as flags and uniforms, some of which diners can wear throughout their dining experience. The rear dining room is quite the contrast: Russian artwork and classic trinkets such as Ma-tryoshka dolls line the walls and quaint lace cloths cover the tables. “It’s intended to not just be about the food, but rather the overall experience,” Vishnu Srinivasa, chemistry freshman and regular patron, said. The restaurant attributes its culinary success to its executive chef, 25-year cook-ing veteran Vladimir Gribkov.“I am in complete control of the menu, and prepare all of the drink and vodka infu-sions,” Gribkov said. “We use old and secret Russian recipes, with only organic vegetables and fruits.”Russian House offers 101 nationally recognized house-infused vodkas, such as mango, elderflower and juniper. The consumption of all flavors has become a com-petition amongst regular pa-trons who flaunt their drink-ing of all the specialty vodkas with a shirt that proclaims their accomplishment.“Last year, we were select-ed as one of the best vodka bars in the United States by USA Today for our selec-tions,” Gribkov said. “Peo-ple come from all over to try our vodkas.” Contributing to the authen-tic atmosphere are the pre-dominantly Eastern European workers, who carefully explain Russian dining etiquette as classic Russian waltzes play in the background.“Russian House is so effective because those who work here understand and value the cultural experi-ence immensely,” Butvin said. “The kitchen staff are Russian, Ukrainian and ex-USSR, while the servers include folks that are Rus-sian, Ukrainian, Hungarian and Serbian.”Russian House not only seeks to bring Russian culture to Austin through décor, food and drinks, but through com-munity outreach such as basic Russian lessons, which help to preserve a culture that is easily misunderstood. Butvin notes that Russian culture is some-thing anyone can enjoy.“There is so much that is universal and incredible about Russian culture — literature, ballet, or painters,” Butvin said. “The negative percep-tions are often political, but when you speak of culture, there is much Russia has brought to the world, and it’s great that a diverse place like Austin can experience it.”of tickets to the rescreening of Selena in every location last year.Bergara said Selena’s spike in popularity is a combina-tion of it being close to the 20th anniversary of Selena’s death and a growing sense of cultural pride.“Right now Chicano cul-ture is such a big thing es-pecially given the political landscape,” Bergara said. “The look, the energy and the vibe is definitely  an op-portunity for Latina women to wave their flag and say this is what we look like in America in 2017, we still look like Selena, we still love Selena.”Christina Horton, Mex-ican-American and Latino studies sophomore, said Selena is relatable to young-er generations because of her charismatic personality.“She died before I was born, but seeing her in vid-eos and interviews, she was very real,” Horton said. “Her confidence sparked confi-dence in me. If that girl from Corpus Christi can do it, then I from El Paso can do it too. Not just performing, but whatever I want to do in life.”Selena’s confidence and stage presence are the most important aspects of what Bidi Bidi Banda wants to recreate for Selena fans. Ban-da is different from other Selena tribute bands in that Bergara doesn’t impersonate Selena or dress like her. “One of the biggest com-pliments I’ve ever gotten was from some older wom-an. A woman older than my grandmother came up to me and said ‘I saw Selena back in the ‘80s, and you don’t look like her, you don’t ex-actly sing like her, but the energy is the same,’” Berga-ra said. “That’s the biggest compliment I’ve ever gotten through the band.”Bidi Bidi Banda’s true goal is to channel the high energy Selena used to stir in audi-ences, and Bergara says they plan to bring it to the High-ball again this year.  “That’s all we’re trying to do is capture the energy,” Bergara said. “We want to take people back.”Name: CLASSIFIEDS; Width: 60p0; Depth: 10 in; Color: Black; Ad Number: -MEDICALDonate Sperm, Get Paid!Healthy men, age 18-39apply atCLINICAL RESEARCH COORDINATORCandidate with prior experience as a clinical research coordinator or academic experience as a research assistant needed to join our clinical research team at Red Oak Psychiatry Associates in Houston, TX.

Alisa Hernandez, international relations and sociology sophomore, said she hopes the tabling will help students who are un-aware of the impact they can make. As Amnesty’s trea-surer, Hernandez has made her own impact by fundrais-ing for the event through selling succulents.“Sometimes it’s hard when you know that things are go-ing on but you don’t know what to do about it,” Her-nandez said. “So we have a lot of different clubs tabling and hopefully people will be inspired and get involved around campus.”Hernandez said she was ex-cited to host an event around intersectional feminism be-cause of its importance in today’s society. Although the feminist movement has been around for over a century, she said the movement also has a history of exclusiveness within itself.“It’s really important be-cause often when people throw around the word ‘fem-inist,’ it’s what is called ‘white feminism,’” Hernandez said. “(White feminism) is when people don’t understand that lives are intersectional and different forms of oppression affect certain people more than others. So we decided to emphasize intersectionality because we want people to understand the importance of it and what feminism is and should be.”Name: 5347/South Texas College of Law; Width: 29p6; Depth: 10 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5347Name: 5679/House Ads; Width: 29p6; Depth: 10 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5679Grace GilkerTEXAS TRAVESTY“TSM helped me  nd a community of likeminded individuals who share sarcasm as a preferred coping mechanism.”HELP US MAGNIFY UT’SSTUDENT VOICESTHROUGH ACHARITABLE GIFT TODAY.6 SPTS6TYLER HORKA, SPORTS EDITOR | @texansportsMonday, April 10, 2017BASEBALL | OKLAHOMA 2-1 TEXASBy Wills Layton@willsdebeastWTexas still searching for first conference winSOFTBALL | OKLAHOMA 6-0 TEXASBy Vanessa Le@vanessaleOn Saturday, senior first baseman Kacy Cle-mens sent the Sooners home with bitter tastes in their mouths after blast-ing a grand slam in the Longhorns’ blowout win.Less than 24 hours later, Oklahoma had to return to UFCU Disch-Falk Field to meet Texas for the finale of the Red River Showdown.But the Longhorns didn’t let the Sooners for-get about the previous game just yet. They imme-diately loaded the bases in the first inning to recreate the exact same scenar-io that ended in a grand slam Saturday.Same runners on base, same batter at the plate.Although Clemens couldn’t send another ball out of the park, he hit a sacrifice fly to give the Longhorns an early ad-vantage in the game. But Texas couldn’t hold onto its lead and dropped the final game to Oklaho-ma, 2-1, falling short of the sweep.Despite the frustrat-ing loss, the Longhorns still remain positive about their performance this weekend.“It’s just when you get to two first wins and you do have the opportuni-ty (to sweep), it’s a little frustrating that you don’t finish the job, unless you get blown out,” head coach David Pierce said. “We didn’t get blown out, we just didn’t come up with a clutch hit, so overall it was a good weekend for us.”But after the first in-ning, Clemens didn’t get another chance to help his team in the game.During his next at-bat, he struck out looking and disagreed with the home plate umpire’s call, yelling a few words in rebuttal. But the umpire silenced him by ejecting him from the game.Burnt orange fans — who were hoping to see Clemens repeat his of-fensive success — were anything but silent, how-ever. The stadium erupt-ed in boos and heckles at the umpire about the controversial call.Junior Jake McKenzie replaced Clemens at first base and collected a hit, but the Longhorns still missed the presence of Clemens’ production at the plate.“Any time your four-hole hitter and your lead-ing RBI guy is not in that ball game, it definitely changes (things),” Pierce said. “But I’m really proud of Jake. He steps in, gets a base hit, hit the ball well the second time and played great defense. It’s unfortunate that it hap-pened, but we’ve got to move on.”From there, the momen-tum shifted to the Soon-ers’ side. Junior pitcher Kyle Johnston started the game with five dominant scoreless innings. But the Sooners finally caught up to Johnston and brought in a crucial run that tied the game at 1-1. Oklahoma continued to find the ball in the seventh inning and scored another run against sophomore reliever Chase Shugart to take a 2-1 lead.Sophomore reliever Beau Ridgeway gave his team a chance to make a comeback by tossing scoreless innings in the eighth and ninth, but the Longhorns were unable to rally, giving Oklahoma the win.“I know that we’re a great team,” junior right fielder Travis Jones said. “I think everyone else in the locker room knows that we’re a great team. It’s just that we kind of have to swing the bats whenever we’ve got great pitching on the mound and we didn’t do that today and it costed us the game.”One inning can make the biggest difference in softball. The Longhorns played the reigning national champions, the Oklahoma Sooners, incredibly close all weekend long, los-ing by two runs or less in the first two games of the three-game series. Sunday’s 6-0 shutout wasn’t nearly as close. The Sooners earned just one run in the series finale, but the Longhorns com-mitted several defensive errors in the top of the sec-ond inning that led to five Oklahoma runs. The Longhorns managed five hits in Sunday’s 6-0 loss. Senior third baseman Celina Felix went 2-for-3 at the plate and senior first baseman Kelli Hanzel hit a triple, but the Long-horns struggled to bring runners home.     “I thought we competed pretty well down the stretch of the game,” head coach Connie Clark said. “But again we gave away a lot of opportunities and just weren’t creative enough to get it done offensively.” Texas’ offense scored just three total runs in the series and hasn’t been able to exceed that mark since last weekend’s matchup against Houston. The Longhorns have a history this season of hang-ing in there with ranked opponents and then stum-bling in the final innings, losing by just one or two runs on multiple occasions.“We’re right there ev-ery time in ballgames and we’re just coming up a little short,” senior pitcher Ti-arra Davis said. “When we get those key wins in those moments and come out on top I think we’re going to be very successful.” In the midst of a four-game losing streak, Texas still has chances to rack up some conference wins with series against Texas Tech, Iowa State, Kansas and No. 13 Baylor.Despite getting swept by Oklahoma, the Long-horns consider the series a good learning experience moving forward.  “I think it builds our mental toughness,” Felix said. “We had to face one of the top teams in the country, so we know how to compete.”The Longhorns carry a 20-18 record as they get ready to hit the road for next weekend’s three-game series against Texas Tech. The team is still searching for its first conference win as it prepares for the Red Raiders. Texas players un-derstand the importance of sharpening up on de-fense for the remainder of the season. “Just play loose, play like how we always do, play comfortable like we usu-ally are in practice,” Felix said. “We have to take that out onto the field when it’s game time.” With four weeks re-maining in the regular sea-son, the team looks toward finishing the rest of the season strong.  “We just need to find a way to continue to play hard,” Clark said. “You can’t give up obviously there’s a lot of ball to be played in the final month and we just have to keep working.”Longhorns earn series win over SoonersBriana VargasDaily Texan StaffSenior first baseman Kacy Clemens swings the bat  during Texas’ 2-1 loss to Oklahoma on Sunday.

But on April 12, one concert will seek to benefit more than just active gym goers and weary students.From 6 to 9:30 p.m., UT’s Amnesty International chap-ter will host their annual Jamensty event, a benefit concert featuring local bands to raise awareness for human rights. This year, the club chose to focus on intersec-tional feminism, with all pro-ceeds being donated to Aus-tin Tan Cerca de la Frontera, an organization that works to fight against injustice for female workers along the Texas-Mexico border. Considering the club’s mostly female membership, Maleeha Syed, journalism junior and chapter president, said the theme of feminism was inevitable.“We have a very present fe-male force on our leadership team,” Syed said. “But it’s such an important issue, even for the boys.”Syed said she was excited to discuss inclusivity within the feminist movement.“When we talk about inter-sectional feminism, we never want to exclude a group,” Syed said. “So we talk about trans rights and the LGBTQ com-munity and women of color, among others. You can’t miss out on a marginalized group, which is the whole idea.”In addition to live music, the concert will also feature spoken word poets and var-ious petitions for attendants to sign. Syed said she hopes the petitions will get people involved and eager to learn about social justice issues.“We get to teach so many people about Amnesty and how we try to raise human rights awareness around campus,” Syed said. “It’s really cool to see all kinds of people at the concert who you never thought would be interested.”Danin Yorn, an anthropology Last year, The Highball faced its biggest crowd ever when over 1000 people showed up to hear Bidi Bidi Banda, Austin’s own Selena tribute band. This year, the celebration is going to be even bigger in remembrance of what would be the late singer’s 46th birthday.Next Sunday, Bidi Bidi Banda is hosting Selenafest for the second year in a row. The festival is celebrated on Selena’s birthday which will fall on Easter Sunday this year. The festival will last lon-ger than previous years since the band plans to double up on shows to accommodate bigger crowds throughout the day. A representative of the city council will be at the festival to declare April 16 Selena Day in Austin.“In a city where a fear of gentrification is on every-one’s list, to say Tejano music is an important thing for us to recognize and this is the day for that, is important to our community because it’s positive celebration,” Keith Ruckus, entertainment di-rector at The Highball, said. “If there’s going to be tears it’s going to be tears of joy that day.”Lead vocalist Stephanie Bergara said the festival will include a Selena look-a-like contest, a dance contest and Cumbia dance lessons in between performanc-es from Bidi Bidi Banda and Su Madre. The proclamation is a vic-tory for Tejano music fans in Austin, where the genre often gets sidelined by larger music scenes, Bergara said.“It’s important for Austin to host Selenafest because if you look at the land-scape of Tejano music, it’s regionally based in San An-tonio,” Bergara said. “It puts our flag in the ground and says we in Austin love Tejano music, too.”The Selena fandom is booming all over again in locations across Texas. The Alamo Drafthouse sold out After the release of his solo breakout I Love You, Honeybear, Josh Tillman faced a difficult decision — create another record with the same sound and risk repetition, or go out on a limb and risk losing his fans. Now that he has chosen the latter, Father John Misty is poised to rule over the indie world, releasing an album full of confrontational ballads.In addition to producing solo albums as J. Tillman since 2004, Tillman also played drums briefly for Fleet Foxes. After he left the band in 2012, Tillman adopted his current mon-iker and persona Father John Misty, a man whose over-exuberant passion on stage paired with a fun-lov-ing spirit, conscious lyr-ics and witty observations make for quite a show. His debut album Fear Fun missed its mark slightly, but I Love You, Honeybear at-tracted the fervent support of indie fans with its sappy pop sound and lovey dovey story lines. Now, with Pure Comedy, FJM turns over a new leaf, coaxing out satiri-cal and ironic content to the forefront of his music.Upon first listen, Pure Comedy was a letdown. It’s nowhere near as welcoming as its predecessor, featuring mainly piano ballads and solo acoustic songs that can run as long as 14 minutes in the case of the storytell-ing-epic “Leaving L.A.” It was a letdown to hear this instrumental de-evolu-tion of FJM’s music — the entire album felt like one long Twitter rant, going on and on to the point where it might be considered self-parody.However, after a few more listens, the record reveals a few merits. “Pure Comedy” is the obvious standout, combining the pop-feel of Misty’s previ-ous successes with aggres-sive, two-pronged lyrics that attack both sides of the political spectrum. It’s the instrumentation makes this song go from enjoy-able to memorable, but that key element is nowhere to be found for the rest of the record. “Total Entertain-ment Forever” comes close with its laugh-inducing lyr-ics, but for the rest of the project it is ballad after bal-lad for over an hour.The worst part of Pure Comedy is its pretentious outlook. It was charm-ing when mixed in with love songs and a few jokes. Now, it’s far too in-your-face. Tracks such as “When the God of Love Returns There’ll Be Hell To Pay,” take on sparse instrumen-tation to keep the attention of Misty’s lyrics, but the repetition between songs and the high-brow remarks make some songs unlisten-able. In “There’ll Be Hell To Pay,” Misty sings, “Every monster has a code, One that steadies the shaking hand, And he’s determined to accrue more capital by whatever means he can,” making him sound like a self-proclaimed prophet lecturing a packed church on the dangers of greed.Pure Comedy challenges FJM fans to wake up and see the true side of society hid-den behind his schmaltzy pop tunes, a society that’s dark and brooding, of-ten centered around self-ishness and conflict. The buffer between Tillman’s morbid curiosities is what kept fans so engaged in his last record. He’s throwing strife upon an audience that already knows and feels his pains.On his first two albums, Father John Misty walked the tightrope between playful and painful per-fectly, writing songs that impressed sonically and lyrically. But now on his third he’s let his pseudonym get to his head, becoming a full-blown preacher to a crowd that doesn’t really want to listen.Name: 5671/Capital Metro; Width: 29p6; Depth: 5 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5671Name: 5665/Kunik Orthodontics; Width: 19p4; Depth: 4 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: 5665Name: HOUSE/SSV; Width: 60p0; Depth: 2 in; Color: Process color; Ad Number: -DONATE TODAY8 L&A     RECYCLE♲AFTER READING YOUR COPY MAE HAMILTON, LIFE&ARTS EDITOR | @thedailytexan 8Monday, April 10, 2017ALBUM REVIEW| ‘PURE COMEDY’By Chris Duncan@Chr_dunc‘Pure Comedy’ turns to more serious soundsCAMPUS MUSIC‘Jamnesty’ makes concerted effort to support human rightsBidi Bidi Banda celebrates Selena, hosts tribute festivalChase Karacostas | Daily Texan StaffMaleeha Syed, journalism junior and UT Amnesty Interna-tional chapter president, and Danin Yorn, anthropology and French junior, coordinated the annual Jamnesty concert.By Ashley Salinas@ashley_salinas3By Andrea Tinning@andreawinningJAMNESTY page 5SELENA page 5Thalia Juarez | Daily Texan file photoFather John Misty’s newest record explores the darker side of his music, bringing irony and sarcastic critiques to the forefront of every song.
