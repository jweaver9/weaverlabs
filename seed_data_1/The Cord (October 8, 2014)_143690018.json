Before the end of the campaign period, the candidates – Erika Traub, Dave Jaworsky, Dave MacDonald and Rami Said – will have had several opportunities to interact with students at on-campus events and put forth their own efforts to reach out. Rick Camman, vice president of student affairs at Wilfrid Laurier Uni-versity’s Students’ Union, explained that Jaworsky was the only candidate to initiate contact with the Union. Camman and two other members of the Union were invited to his office to pose questions and get clarifica-tion on his platform.While the rest didn’t reach out first, Camman was able to get in touch with them for the mayoral debate, which was held at Laurier last week. In terms of those who attended, he said he was happy to see how engaged they were with students.“They all seemed very student-friendly,” he said. “They do seem to have an understanding of at least some of the issues facing students. It was very refreshing.”Traub, Jaworsky and Said were present at the debate.In addition, a meet and greet for students and candidates was hosted at the University of Waterloo on Tuesday – all four mayoral candi-dates were in attendance. Lastly, a debate will be held at UW on Oct. 20. Stephane Hamade, vice president of education at the Federation of Students at UW, said he is still await-ing one candidate to confirm their attendance. “We’re hoping – going forward after this election – to see the city and the region more engaged with students in general,” said Hamade. “Better informing us with things that are happening in the city, getting more students involved on commit-tees and hopefully attracting more with students.”Hamade has been meeting with marissa evanssenior news editorsheLBy BLaCkLeycampus news editorLocal, page 9Kicking offQawQueer awareness week to celebrate LGBTQ communityGauging candidates’ student engagement“Our Guys are ready ...

From Oct. 7 to Oct. 10, Laurier’s Rainbow Centre is putting on events for Queer Awareness Week to cel-ebrate and bring awareness to the community. Laura Mae Lindo, director of the diversity and equity office at Laurier, said Queer Awareness Week is a big step for both the volunteers at the office and the general student population.“For me, I see it as the opportunity to take issues out of the shadows and the periphery of an institution and make them central,” she said. “These discussions we always seem to have on the outside.” To Lindo’s knowledge, the Rain-bow Centre, which is dedicated to enhancing the university environ-ment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer individuals on campus, was the first centre brought to the diversity and equity office. “To think that we’ve come so far and that they have this leadership and awareness week — they can plan the Pride Parade and they have a booth — to think they’ve come that far is amazing.

Let me just address this by saying: opinion pieces in no way, shape or form reflect what anyone other than the columnist believes. Our unsigned editorials, which can be found on the editorial page, are the only pieces in the entire paper that represent an opinion of the majority of our staff. Other than that, every piece is only the opinion of the writer. Our job as student media is not to censor anyone, so when a piece comes through that I may not agree with, I would never dismiss it simply because I do not feel the same way as the writer. However, it’s becoming in-creasingly problematic when people assume those pieces represent my views or the views of The Cord staff because it is in the paper. We strive to have a well-rounded opinion section that showcases many different views and sparks debate among readers. We have a diverse readership and as such our columns try to be as diverse as pos-sible. So if you’re reading an opinion piece in the paper and it pisses you off, don’t just dismiss it and get pissed off at The Cord. Get vocal and start a discussion. Write a letter to the editor if you really want to shed light on another side of the argu-ment. kate turnereditor-in-chiefIn the last issue of The Cord, we reported after speaking to police that the male arrested at the State Street party on Homecoming was a Laurier student. Since then it has been revealed that the person arrested was in fact not a Laurier student.photo of the weekwill huang/photo editorfollow us on twitter@corDNEWS@corDArtS@corDSPortSA $1-million donation has been made to Wilfrid Laurier University’s new Global Innovation Exchange building from a local family. When asked why he and his family made the donation, Larry Marsland had one answer: “Because we live in Waterloo.”According to Marsland, his family wanted to give back to their com-munity and thought the best place to do it was through education.“Our business is in Waterloo and we’ve prospered in this community and we hold the two universities in the highest esteem, and we think that they’ve helped us in our busi-ness,” he explained.Marsland and his children, Brad and Melanie, own and manage Marsland Centre Limited in uptown Waterloo. The business owns and develops portfolios of commercial and industrial real estate.The family business started out in 1973 and grew from Marsland’s fa-ther’s company, Marsland Engineer-ing Limited, which was also located in Waterloo in 1929. The company sold a diverse range of electrome-chanical equipment and was a major supplier for IBM. After Leigh Instruments bought the company in 1969, Larry contin-ued as president until 1972 when they launched Marsland Centre Limited. The money from the Marslands’ donation is being used to help construct the building on Univer-sity Avenue, which will be home to Laurier’s school of business and economics and the department of mathematics. The money will be given to the “Startup Fund in the Entrepreneurial Business School,” which will report-edly allow some of the best inves-tors in Ontario to come in and help students.The estimated cost of the project is $103 million, which includes renova-tions to the Peters building. The government of Ontario announced a $72.6-million investment in the GIE building in 2011 and the remaining $30 million is to be raised through Laurier’s “developmental efforts” and sponsorship. “All in all we feel very, very pleased with what they’re doing and it’s going to produce kids who are better equipped to handle busi-ness problems in the future,” said Marsland. According to Marsland, the fam-ily decided to donate because they knew how the school worked in education and where the money will go to help students. They were also encouraged to help out the university by people in the community. So far, Marsland explained they’ve received very positive feedback for their contribution.“I just thought there was really good leadership at Wilfrid Laurier and that’s an even further reason to support it.”The Marslands are also being recognized for their donation: a lec-ture hall on the first floor of the GIE building will be named in honour of the family. The building is set to be complet-ed in 2015, with full occupancy by the 2015 fall academic term.•   3WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014News Senior newS editorMariSSa evanS CaMpuS newS editorShelby blaCkley loCal newS editorvaCantLaurier hosts debateLast Thursday three of the four Wa-terloo mayoral candidates gathered at Wilfrid Laurier University for a debate in the concourse. The debate, which was moder-ated by local media personality Mike Farwell, was the first of two being held by the Wilfrid Laurier Univer-sity Students’ Union, Wilfrid Laurier University Student Publications and the Federation of Students at the University of Waterloo. Erika Traub, Dave Jaworksy and Rami Said were present, however Dave MacDonald was unable to attend. Farwell started the debate off by asking candidates why they thought the 55,000 students in Waterloo should vote for them and how can-didates would reach out to students. The common answer was that can-didates would work to increase the relationship between students and the mayor’s office. Jaworsky asserted a bond between universities and the office might help student issues further come to light at city council.“I want a strategic relationship between the city and the universi-ties,” he continued. Rami Said and Erika Traub argued for a more direct approach, with Said specifying a desire for meetings with student representatives. “I want to have monthly, or at least quarterly meetings, with WLU, UW and Conestoga students’ unions,” said Said. Traub promised advocacy for students. “We have a lot of really good people coming here and you need to know that you have an advocate. I am an advocate,” said Traub. “That’s what I offer you: a commitment to hearing you and working with you.” Farwell stated the most important factor in ensuring students stay in the region after they graduate is job availability. He then asked how candidates would increase employ-ment opportunities for students, if elected mayor. “Manufacturing is starting to come back to Canada, and I believe Waterloo could take a head start bringing it here,” Said stated. “We have a great tech and phenomenal insurance industry, but anybody who doesn’t lie in those two sectors tends to fall through the cracks.” He went on to mention that he would help bring industry back to the region to aid in increasing vari-ous means of employment for the community. Jaworsky mentioned jobs were the reason he and his wife, upon graduation from UW, started their family in the area. He detailed reasons why the community has lost employment, such as the decline of Blackberry, the economic downturn and manufacturing outsourcing. “The Waterloo region, founded 40 years ago, has never had an eco-nomic strategy,” Jaworsky said. “To the world, Waterloo and Waterloo region, there is a lot of difference when you’re looking from China.” Finally, Traub asserted the way to increase employment opportunities for graduates in the region might be removing red tape for businesses, possibly making it easier for new companies to come to Waterloo. “My commitment is to make sure that we remove the roadblocks, which I have heard repeatedly stand in the way of progress,” said Traub. “We have a bureaucracy that is caus-ing businesses to move elsewhere.” Candidates were also asked about what role students have in the Water-loo community. Traub explained she believes that students’ real role is to come to the city and succeed. “The role of the students is to commit to their purpose, study hard, work hard and get their degree so that they leave or stay in Waterloo, feeling like they’ve grown,” said Traub. “Your role is to come here and further yourself.” Said stated that students should be more involved in city politics and that their role is really to be a part of the community.  “This will become their city as much as ours,” he said. Jaworsky focused on students coming here to not only be educated, but to stay and bring innovative ideas to the city. “We need to make sure it’s a top priority to get people to stay here,” he said. The debate ended a few minutes shy of two hours and gave students a real chance to see candidates at their school and hear about their posi-tions in a more casual setting. One of the event organizers, Rick Camman, vice president of student affairs for the Students’ Union, thought the debate was a great success. “I actually thought the event went perfectly as planned, especially having Mike there. He was actually able to decipher what the candidates were saying to give a fair, clear mes-sage and to give more detail,” said Camman. connor wardLead reportermunicipal electionsheather davidson/photo editorFamily uses $1 million to give backThe Marslands, whose business has been based in K-W since 1929, donated to the GIE buildingbusinesskaitlyn severinLead reporterbach nguyen/staff photographerthe GIE building is set to be open in time for the fall academic term in 2015.

The real focus of this week is to set a tone for the rest of the year. “It’s a celebration ... and to rally our volunteers. It’s our first cam-paign of the year and it’s a great chance for our new volunteers and old volunteers to get involved in the centre,” Lieu said. Events such as a booth in the Concourse, a trivia and games night and the annual Pride Parade round out the awareness initiatives. There was also a “positivitree” in the Concourse, where students can leave positive messages about the queer community.Lindo explained that Queer Awareness Week is an opportunity for students and the queer com-munity alike to celebrate rather than focus on the negative aspects.“I love the fact that it’s an aware-ness campaign that doesn’t have to be about negative things. It’s a celebration. It’s a celebration of peoples’ identities, it’s a celebration of difference, it’s a celebration of that sort of strength, that collective strength because you’re out there celebrating who you are,” said Lindo.  The annual Pride Parade will start at 4:15 p.m. in the Quad on Thursday. Students will be going around campus raising awareness and then everyone will return to MacDonald House residence for a reception. Various clubs across campus have been invited to join the celebration. “To bring these people together, even if their focus isn’t on queer awareness or associated with the Rainbow Centre, it’s a matter of showing solidarity and standing proudly with other members of the community,” Lieu said. Lindo admired the potential to bring different communities at Lau-rier together.“It seems like it’s the same people having the talk. It’s these moments and these awareness campaigns that allow different people show up. You bring the celebration to them.”Lindo, who just joined the diver-sity and equity office in the summer, is impressed by the efficiency of the Rainbow Centre. She commended the coordinators and volunteers for their leadership practices and ability to bring such conversations to the forefront.“When I first got here, I was told ... that students were meeting in secret and there was concern about actu-ally meeting collectively and there was no space for them on campus,” she said. “It’s not about issues, it’s about moments and how far we’ve come.”FROM COVERCelebrating queer identitiesKHA VO/LEAD PHOTOGRAPHERthe rainbow centre is hosting the Pride Parade on oct. 9, starting in the Quad, for Queer Awareness Week.LinkedIn praises Laurier businessRANKINGSMARISSA EVANSSENIOR NEWS EDITORLENA YANG/CREATIVE DIRECTORLast week, LinkedIn released uni-versity rankings based on the career outcomes of their graduates. The rankings look at which Canadian schools have allowed their gradu-ates to obtain desirable jobs. Wilfrid Laurier University ranked second for marketers, second for investment bankers and fourth for finance pro-fessionals. The other two categories were accounting professionals and software developers.The rankings are meant to be a tool to help high school students decide where they want to go for post-secondary.“We really wanted to help students identify the universities that are getting people into desirable jobs,” said Danielle Restivo, head of global programs on the communications team at LinkedIn. “That was the key behind this.”Brian Smith, professor and area coordinator of finance at Laurier, said he wasn’t surprised by the uni-versity’s rankings.“We have some strengths in help-ing place students in the finance industry,” he said. “Probably the most prominent one is the co-op program.”Smith explained that in order to obtain finance jobs, especially those in investment banking, students need an edge over candidates from other universities.“When you get a co-op position and you do well, it’s like having a four-month interview,” he continued.Laurie Lahn, manager of market-ing and external relations at the co-operative education centre at Laurier, said that between 50 and 70 per cent of students who do co-op will receive a full job offer from a pre-vious co-op employer.“I’ve been here for 20 years and I’ve seen our finance employers grow from a few employers to more than a 100 students on Bay Street in Toron-to,” Lahn said. “I think our students are landing jobs that would have typically went to Queen’s or Ivey, but because of the co-op experience it’s given them the edge.”Restivo explained that this is just the first stage for the rankings. The study was conducted in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, but they want to expand this to other countries.In Canada, there are more than nine million members on Linke-dIn — compared to the number of professionals in the population, this is a very high saturation.“I think one of the reasons we were able to start with Canada is be-cause we could have a really accurate picture of what’s going on because of that saturation,” she said.While the professions they focused on in Canada were largely business-related, Restivo said they do have plans to expand this.“It was a matter of where we could get the data,” Restivo said. “We looked at where members went after they graduated, what kind of jobs they held now. If they’re working for companies where we’ve seen a lot of activity on their com-pany pages and their job postings, we considered those to be desirable jobs because they’re popular among our members.”Mike Pegutter, a bachelor of business administration graduate from Laurier who is now working as a financial analyst at LoyaltyOne in Toronto, said he believes the rank-ings reflect how the Laurier business program prepares its students for the workforce.One of the things he liked about the program is that students don’t select their specialization until third-year, while other schools require students to choose a stream right away.“A lot of the people that I know that went to Laurier — they seem to have a little bit more of a holistic view of the business as opposed to saying ‘I’m in accounting, I only care about accounting,’” he said. “I think it helped prepare me, especially to approach business problems.”He continued that his experience in the BBA program allowed him to access jobs that were desirable for him due to the hands-on activities the program affords, such as looking at case studies.“Having that case approach definitely helped me a lot with being comfortable with talking to senior people within my company  and then also being able to get my ideas across concisely in presentation form,” Pegutter said.But the ice challenge in fourth-year is what he feels really prepares students. Students are put into randomized groups and are given a challenge by a real company which they must provide solutions for.“You’ve had that exposure to do a presentation — you’ve worked with a group that you haven’t been able to decide yourself, which is a lot more real because at work you can’t really pick who you work with all the time,” he said.According to Kalyani Menon, an associate professor and area coordinator of marketing, one of the reasons Laurier ranked so well in terms of marketing is because of the type of students they have coming into the program. “They’re very motivated,” she said. “In terms of marketing, we’ve been getting good feedback for a long time. I think over the years we’ve been very conscious about adding new courses that are current.”“We’ve kind of known it all along, but to get this external validation from a source with this kind of reach like LinkedIn, that was certainly exhilarating,” said Menon.“We really wanted to help students identify the uni-versities that are getting people into desirable jobs.”-Danielle Restivo, head of global programs on the communications team at LinkedInCampus news   •   5WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014WILL HUANG/PHOTO EDITORLuminaries telling stories of the students that participated in the Love My Life: A Walk for Mental Health trace the quad on oct. 1. the event was to promote conversations about mental health.A walk to improve mental wellnessThe annual Love My Life: A Walk for Mental Health helps students open up about their strugglesKAITLYN SEVERINLEAD REPORTERWilfrid Laurier University’s Mental Health Education Group took an-other step toward eliminating stigma with their annual “Love My Life” walk on Oct. 1. Love My Life: A Walk for Mental Health was organized to promote conversations about mental health. It is an event anyone with or without experiences with mental health is-sues could attend.Around 300 students signed up at the event, not including others who walked around. The walk was from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and included therapy dogs, Zumba and speakers on mental health and depression from Laurier.It kicked off with the Aborigi-nal Traditional Welcome, which included a blessing with incense to begin the walk. Speakers included fourth-year student, Dave Pat-terson, and other Laurier students who talked about their struggle with depression. Shawn Soloman gave a talk about his struggle with bipolar disorder and suicidal tendencies. According to Soloman, he approached Kelly Oddi, the mother of Jon Oddi, who committed suicide and inspired the event, to talk about his pain.“About a month after talking to Kelly, I had the worst depressive epi-sode of my life,” said Soloman, “I was suicidal to the point I was ordered not to be left alone and I even forgot how to spell my mother’s name,” he said. “One night when I thought about killing myself, I remembered my talk with Kelly and the impact that suicide had on her and her family. I believe that our brief encounter may have saved my life.”Soloman hopes his story may help others struggling with mental illness to seek out support at Laurier. Dave and Susan Lewis, the found-ers of Minds in Motion K-W Walking Classic, were also there to talk to students before the walk began. They were also accepting donations from participants to help provide footwear for victims of mental illness so they can use fitness for their recovery. Brittney Kubitz, a third-year busi-ness student, said she enjoyed how the speakers talked about eating disorders and depression and how they overcame it.“Even though they’re sometimes still struggling through it, [students] have support through Laurier.”Bridget McDonald, the external coordinator for Peer Help Line, praised the event.“Peer Help Line was out all day supporting the Love My Life Walk for Mental Health,” she said. “We had an absolute blast and were able to give out resources to tons of students. It was a great way for the whole Laurier community to show support for our peers who are affected by mental illness.”Special Constable Services also hosted a barbeque during the event. The money raised went to the Special Olympics and Walk for Mental Health.Amy Robinson, a student at Laurier who spoke for the first time at Love My Life, said speaking at the event was terrifying but empowering. She talked to students at the event about her rough childhood and her troubles dealing with depression and anxiety in high school. During her speech, she related her struggles with mental illness with a metaphor about flowers needing wa-ter and soil to grow, much like how children need love and affection.Robinson works for Laurier’s Student Health and Development Centre, is part of their advisory team and also has a volunteer facilitator position for workshops starting this winter.“The ability to be in an environ-ment that can surround you and strengthen who you are as a person I feel really encompasses a lot of Laurier and mental health and all the stuff we’re doing around to make people aware that it could be anything, from stressing out about midterms or it could be something much more serious. But it still all fits within that mental wellness frame-work,” Robinson said.“I believe that our brief encounter may have saved my life.”-Shawn Soloman, speaker at the Love My Life walkMENTAL HEALTHHEALTHSpace made for holistic healthWellness Centre has grand openingMADDY CUTTSCORD NEWSKHA VO/LEAD PHOTOGRAPHERthe grand opening of the Student Wellness centre is just the beginning for helping health services on campus.Students will no longer have to search for health resources on Wilfrid Laurier University’s campus, following the grand opening of the new Wellness Centre last week. The ceremony on Oct. 2 marked the of-ficial opening of the newly renovated space, which has been in the works for some time. The project, which was the result of an external review of the campus’ mental health services, has been in the works since summer 2013. “Mental health issues and post-secondary has been on everybody’s radar,” said Karen Ostrander, director the Wellness Centre. “So to try and be pro-active [Student Affairs] com-missioned this review.” The review allowed for outside consultants to come in and gain feedback from a variety of on-cam-pus groups, ranging from the Wilfrid Laurier University Graduate Stu-dents’ Association to the Accessible Learning Centre, as well as on-site counselling services. The report spurred the creation of the Student Wellness Initiative, which actively sought ways to build upon the resources available to students on-campus. The goal was to bring physical and mental health services under one triage and give students a single gateway to find help.“By having the Wellness Centre together we have one door, so every door is the right door,” said Os-trander, A leading inspiration for the initia-tive was found at the Brantford cam-pus, where a single wellness centre has been the model for many years. This model was considered, along with information garnered through visits to numerous other post-secondary institutions across the province, in creating the framework for Waterloo’s own unified health services centre. The project received overwhelm-ing support from students and staff alike. Not only were participants eager to amalgamate their services, but were also willing to work as a team to realize this new endeavour. Students also played a crucial role in the merger and renovation, with a large portion of the funding for the project coming from the GSA and the Wilfrid Laurier University Students’ Union. Driven by the response, work was quickly underway to bring together all campus resources under a single roof. The single location was a logical choice to Ostrander, who said that students were often confused about which service to use, or through which door they could access help. The goal of the singular building was also to help de-stigmatize seek-ing out mental health services. The goal was that having access to the shared reception and waiting room would allow students to comfort-ably seek out services relating to any aspect of their overall health. “People came to health services for so many reasons, you have a sore throat or you think you have mono, it could be for an annual physical,” said Ostrander. “So why should it be any different for people accessing mental health services?”Following the grand unveiling, the Wellness Centre was already looking to the future, with ideas and projects on the horizon to further innovate and render accessible health services on campus. Though having just become situ-ated in their new space, there were no imminent plans to settle.“It’s not just over now that we’ve got the process done,” she said.Campus news   •   5WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014WILL HUANG/PHOTO EDITORLuminaries telling stories of the students that participated in the Love My Life: A Walk for Mental Health trace the quad on oct. 1. the event was to promote conversations about mental health.A walk to improve mental wellnessThe annual Love My Life: A Walk for Mental Health helps students open up about their strugglesKAITLYN SEVERINLEAD REPORTERWilfrid Laurier University’s Mental Health Education Group took an-other step toward eliminating stigma with their annual “Love My Life” walk on Oct. 1.

According to Soloman, he approached Kelly Oddi, the mother of Jon Oddi, who committed suicide and inspired the event, to talk about his pain.“About a month after talking to Kelly, I had the worst depressive epi-sode of my life,” said Soloman, “I was suicidal to the point I was ordered not to be left alone and I even forgot how to spell my mother’s name,” he said. “One night when I thought about killing myself, I remembered my talk with Kelly and the impact that suicide had on her and her family. I believe that our brief encounter may have saved my life.”Soloman hopes his story may help others struggling with mental illness to seek out support at Laurier. Dave and Susan Lewis, the found-ers of Minds in Motion K-W Walking Classic, were also there to talk to students before the walk began. They were also accepting donations from participants to help provide footwear for victims of mental illness so they can use fitness for their recovery. Brittney Kubitz, a third-year busi-ness student, said she enjoyed how the speakers talked about eating disorders and depression and how they overcame it.“Even though they’re sometimes still struggling through it, [students] have support through Laurier.”Bridget McDonald, the external coordinator for Peer Help Line, praised the event.“Peer Help Line was out all day supporting the Love My Life Walk for Mental Health,” she said. “We had an absolute blast and were able to give out resources to tons of students. It was a great way for the whole Laurier community to show support for our peers who are affected by mental illness.”Special Constable Services also hosted a barbeque during the event. The money raised went to the Special Olympics and Walk for Mental Health.Amy Robinson, a student at Laurier who spoke for the first time at Love My Life, said speaking at the event was terrifying but empowering. She talked to students at the event about her rough childhood and her troubles dealing with depression and anxiety in high school. During her speech, she related her struggles with mental illness with a metaphor about flowers needing wa-ter and soil to grow, much like how children need love and affection.Robinson works for Laurier’s Student Health and Development Centre, is part of their advisory team and also has a volunteer facilitator position for workshops starting this winter.“The ability to be in an environ-ment that can surround you and strengthen who you are as a person I feel really encompasses a lot of Laurier and mental health and all the stuff we’re doing around to make people aware that it could be anything, from stressing out about midterms or it could be something much more serious. But it still all fits within that mental wellness frame-work,” Robinson said.“I believe that our brief encounter may have saved my life.”-Shawn Soloman, speaker at the Love My Life walkMENTAL HEALTHHEALTHSpace made for holistic healthWellness Centre has grand openingMADDY CUTTSCORD NEWSKHA VO/LEAD PHOTOGRAPHERthe grand opening of the Student Wellness centre is just the beginning for helping health services on campus.Students will no longer have to search for health resources on Wilfrid Laurier University’s campus, following the grand opening of the new Wellness Centre last week. The ceremony on Oct. 2 marked the of-ficial opening of the newly renovated space, which has been in the works for some time. The project, which was the result of an external review of the campus’ mental health services, has been in the works since summer 2013. “Mental health issues and post-secondary has been on everybody’s radar,” said Karen Ostrander, director the Wellness Centre. “So to try and be pro-active [Student Affairs] com-missioned this review.” The review allowed for outside consultants to come in and gain feedback from a variety of on-cam-pus groups, ranging from the Wilfrid Laurier University Graduate Stu-dents’ Association to the Accessible Learning Centre, as well as on-site counselling services. The report spurred the creation of the Student Wellness Initiative, which actively sought ways to build upon the resources available to students on-campus. The goal was to bring physical and mental health services under one triage and give students a single gateway to find help.“By having the Wellness Centre together we have one door, so every door is the right door,” said Os-trander, A leading inspiration for the initia-tive was found at the Brantford cam-pus, where a single wellness centre has been the model for many years. This model was considered, along with information garnered through visits to numerous other post-secondary institutions across the province, in creating the framework for Waterloo’s own unified health services centre. The project received overwhelm-ing support from students and staff alike. Not only were participants eager to amalgamate their services, but were also willing to work as a team to realize this new endeavour. Students also played a crucial role in the merger and renovation, with a large portion of the funding for the project coming from the GSA and the Wilfrid Laurier University Students’ Union. Driven by the response, work was quickly underway to bring together all campus resources under a single roof. The single location was a logical choice to Ostrander, who said that students were often confused about which service to use, or through which door they could access help. The goal of the singular building was also to help de-stigmatize seek-ing out mental health services. The goal was that having access to the shared reception and waiting room would allow students to comfort-ably seek out services relating to any aspect of their overall health. “People came to health services for so many reasons, you have a sore throat or you think you have mono, it could be for an annual physical,” said Ostrander. “So why should it be any different for people accessing mental health services?”Following the grand unveiling, the Wellness Centre was already looking to the future, with ideas and projects on the horizon to further innovate and render accessible health services on campus. Though having just become situ-ated in their new space, there were no imminent plans to settle.“It’s not just over now that we’ve got the process done,” she said.6   •   Campus news   WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014ICT implements single sign-onTECHNOLOGYPEARL LEUNGCORD NEWSThanks to the new single sign-on procedure, Wilfrid Laurier Univer-sity’s online resources have become more user-friendly for students.In the past, Laurier students had to log in each time they wanted to access online university resources, such as MyLearningSpace and the Library website. They were also logged out of the resources after a period of inactivity.Continuous logins and time-outs were the only way the university could verify that users were students and had the right to use these ap-plications. This changed when the depart-ment of information and com-munications technology at Laurier implemented single sign-on. The idea is that students will now only have to sign in once to gain ac-cess to a multitude of resources that require credentials. “We’re trying to strike that balance between access and security, and we think we’ve got it pretty good,” said Ken Boyd, director of ICT solutions at Laurier.At the moment, the only applica-tions that work with SSO are the student e-mail accounts and the online resources available through the Laurier Library website. However, ICT plans on expanding. “We have a list of other applica-tions we want to [make more acces-sible],” said Boyd. This includes MyLS, Navigator and LORIS.Students are often frustrated by the time-outs and multiple logins that the system required before a single sign-on method.“This will definitely make it easier to use,” said Gunjan Marwah, a third-year business student.Applications used by faculty will also be altered to work with SSO. Consequently, the procedure has yet to be completely implemented. According to Yi Ruan, team lead of ICT infrastructure and one of the head workers on the project, there is no fixed timeline. “There’s integration work that needs to be done on the application side,” said Boyd. Some applications, such as LORIS, will require more work than others.Despite this uncertainty, Boyd predicts ICT will be able to integrate a new application every month. SSO comes with one caveat: to log out of all active accounts, the student must close the web browser. “The concept is single sign-on, not single sign-off,” Ruan said. When a student logs onto the sys-tem, a token is created on the server. That token allows the student to access all applications that work with SSO. However, the server does not know if logging out of one applica-tion “means [the student] wants to sign off of every other application [he or she is logged into],” explained Ruan. As a result, the user cannot log out of all the open applications by simply logging out of one. The only way to do this — also called destroying the token — is to close the browser. While this security issue does not pose a large threat when it is being used on a personal laptop, tablet or smartphone, it should be considered when using a public device or bor-rowing someone else’s device. “Security is extremely important to ICT,” said Boyd. “And this helps us improve our security footprint without being too onerous.”josh awolade/graphics editor“we’re trying to strike that balance between access and security, and we think we’ve got it pretty good.”-Ken Boyd, director of ict solutionsNew single-stream login makes university online resources user-friendly for students and facultyLocaL news   •   7WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014researchsocial mediacommunityStudy reveals key to self-loveBaby pajamas go viralLittle Libraries of K-W gaining popularityA recently released psychology study from the University of Waterloo indicated that women who display more self-compassion tend to have a more positive body image regardless of their body mass index. Despite this, women who have a higher BMI generally tend to exhibit eating dis-turbances and a lower body image.The study was conducted by Allison Kelly, an assistant psychol-ogy professor at UW, along with Kiruthiha Vimalakanthan and Kath-ryn Miler, both graduate students at UW.The study surveyed 153 female undergraduate students who re-ported on their body image, eating pathology, self-compassion and self-esteem. It found that women with self-compassion tended to approach life with an increased level of patience and understanding in reference to themselves, resulting in a more posi-tive body image. They tended to have more normal eating habits and be less concerned about their weight.“They have better body image and also they just tend to tolerate it when there are parts of their body that they don’t like,” said Kelly. “Self-compassion seems to protect, especially more overweight women, from having bad body im-age and engaging in more disorder eating.”Women who demonstrated lower self-compassion have a difficult time being nice and reassuring to themselves when they fail, and consequently also tend to have lower self-esteem. This is with regard to their bodies, along with other areas of life.According to Kelly, self-compas-sion differs from self-esteem, as people who possess high self-esteem generally think they are very success-ful and above the average.  “The reality is that for most of us there are going to be periods in our life when we fail, other people do better than us and so forth, and so that actually makes it pretty hard to maintain self-esteem unless you are somehow always outperforming oth-ers,” Kelly explained.Self-compassion conversely offers a different type of positive self-image that allows one to act more nurturing to oneself even in the face of failure. It is more about self-acceptance and unconditional self-love.When some individuals who have really high self-esteem fail, it tends to diminish their confidence and does not always allow them to recognize how they may have contributed to their failure. People with a high degree of self-compassion, however, are able to recognize and learn from their mistakes.“More and more research is show-ing that if we want to help people be resilient and roll with the punches that life presents, just generally, and also with regards to body image … then self-compassion might be a more important thing to cultivate than just trying to boost your self-esteem,” said Kelly.According to Kelly, other research is also showing a correlation be-tween mental health and self-com-passion. People who are self-com-passionate tend to have lower levels of depression, anxiety and eating disorders. They are also able to cope better when faced with obstacles, such as a break-up, medical illnesses and poor grades, among others. “The less critical one is on them-self, the more likely they are to think positively of themselves,” said Aviva Abramovitch, a fourth-year psy-chology student at Wilfrid Laurier University. “The more positive out-look would then cause them to have positive body image and all around more positivity in life.”Research also indicates that self-criticism is extremely detrimental to a person’s well-being. There are a lot of different ways that can help people to increase their level of self-compassion.Additionally, there are different forms of psychotherapy that one can undergo in order to gain help dealing with a particular issue, or to simply become more self-compassionate. Self-help strategies are also tactics that can be utilized to cultivate indi-vidual self-compassion.Little Libraries of Kitchener-Water-loo, a not-for-profit organization that enables homeowners to build their own libraries, is expanding its pres-ence in the Region of Waterloo. “It’s the idea that you build a little library, you put it on a lawn and you fill it up with books that you’re willing to let people read,” explained Kelly Kipfer, manager of community engagement and children’s ser-vices at the Waterloo Public Library. “There’s no formal process of check-ing materials out.” The program sells kits, which cost $50 to homeowners, and they then assemble and keep on their property for neighbours to access.People walking by are able to pick up and return books as they please.“The idea is more so that people can put books that they’re done with,” Kipfer continued. “When people put their books out there, there’s no expectation that it comes back. People put new books, they might take one from you and put three more in.” Accordingly, there’s no concern about possible thefts that might occur.Though there are not very many registered in the Little Free Library registry, there are many popping up around the Kitchener-Waterloo area, including one on Peppler Street around the Erb Street intersection in Waterloo.Tom Nagy, who created Little Li-braries of K-W, said he doesn’t have any formal objective for the number of little libraries the organization hopes to strive for.“It’s just a fun volunteer project and the numbers keep going up,” Nagy said. “More and more people get en-ticed by seeing them.” The goal of Little Libraries of K-W is to share the strong literary experi-ences that owners of books have with other people by putting their books out there for other people to read. Since it is a community project, homeowners get to select which books they end up putting in their libraries. It’s also meant to spark conversa-tions around books, since borrowers will be visiting their neighbours’ properties. Additionally, Little Libraries of K-W aims to create an environment where people can step on each other’s property, in a way that’s “safe and controlled for everybody.” “It breaks down the wall that builds in your mind about what is property and what our society quan-tifies as property,” said Nagy. Superman baby pajamas from Target elicited a social media outcry that has gone viral. Protestors are arguing that the pajamas are sexist because they reinforce traditional gender roles in young children. The female pajama jumper is the colour pink, branded with the Superman logo and the words “I only date heroes.” Con-versely, the male’s is the colour grey, labeled with the Superman logo and the phrase “Future man of steel.”“Messages to boys tend to empha-size strength and ability and doing things,” said Christine Logel, an assistant social development profes-sor at the University of Waterloo. “Messages to girls tend to emphasize appearance and being appealing to others, particularly to men.” Logel was out shopping for her two young children with her friend Aimee Morrison, an associate profes-sor of English at UW, when she saw the pajamas for sale. “When I saw those baby PJs — made for three-month-olds — out of the corner of my eye, my heart sank,” said Logel.She snapped a picture of the pajamas and out of frustration took her complaints to management. She said the assistant manager thought the pajamas were cute.  Logel left a note detailing her concerns to the manager, however the manager never responded to her objection of the pajamas.Target declined to comment at this point in time, however released a statement saying, “Target strives to treat all our guests with respect, and it is never our intent to offend anyone. We appreciate the feedback we’ve received and will continue to listen to our guests to ensure we offer merchandise that appeals to, and re-flects, our diverse guest population.” Initially, Logel posted the picture on her Facebook account where it got some response, however it was when the photo was shared through Morrison’s Twitter account that it became viral. The photo now has over 700 shares on Twitter and has elicited world-wide responses.Some social media users objected to these protests however, and did not believe that the pajamas were a problem.“I think some people can get way too extreme over nothing,” said Avigael Samson, a fourth-year gen-eral arts student at Wilfrid Laurier University. “These babies don’t even know how to read, they can’t even walk. I don’t really think it affects these babies.”Logel addressed this claim by drawing on research of classical psychology studies.“Baby boys and girls, if they have diapers on, are identical in every way. And yet adults are already see-ing them by these potentially damag-ing, narrow roles,” she said.Logel said psychology studies in-dicate that adults treat the same baby differently based on the sex. She contested that if babies were to wear these jumpers, gender-spe-cific stereotypes will be reinforced, supporting this notion.  “None of us felt that one pair of PJs will destroy babies’ lives. But they are a very small, but very real part of the problem,” she said.daina goldfingerlead reporterdaina goldfingerlead reporteralifya rajkotwala Staff writercontributed image“Sexist” baby pajamas, sold at target in conestoga Mall, started a debate on twitter about gender stereotypes.jessica dik/staff photographerFor $50, residents can buy kits and build their own library on their property,“it’s just a fun volunteer project and the numbers keep going up.”-tom nagy, creator of Little Libraries of k-WMany free libraries have been springing up on residents’ lawns in the Kitchener-Waterloo areaA UW prof began an online debate over ‘sexist’ clothing8   •   LOCAL NEWS   WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014Kitchener-Waterloo’s Out of the Cold program, a series of locations working together to o\u0004 er the region’s homeless a safe place to sleep dur-ing the winter months, has been struggling through the past year.  e program has lost  ve host sites since last winter and has experienced trouble trying to recruit new host sites or volunteers. Ray of Hope, a Christian-based centre situated in Kitchener that fo-cuses on o\u0004 ering aid services to the region’s disadvantaged, marginalized or troubled, was the  rst location to opt out of hosting Out of the Cold. Ray of Hope, which facilitates nightly hot meals for those in need through the winter, could not accommodate the renovations that were neces-sary to continue on as part of the program. Instead, it opted to continue serving meals to the large amount of people who regularly show during the winter months. “We were the  rst group last fall that had to make a decision not to continue this year,” said Harry Whyte, CEO of Ray of Hope. “Our expectation is that with Out of the Cold closing, instead of people going to other locations to have dinner, they’ll be coming here  rst before heading to the Y, on the nights that the Y is open.”  e YWCA, referred to as the Y, has been supporting e\u0004 orts to bolster other safe places for home-less to stay in the region.  e YWCA, traditionally only operating shelter services for women, trans persons and families, will now operate a new, 50-person shelter that also will care for homeless men.  e new emergency shelter, sta\u0004 ed with people who are well versed in harm-reduction strategy and experience in working with mental health issues, will be open nightly starting in November going through to May. Other facilities still a  liated with Out of  e Cold will be remaining open. One such facility, St. Louis Catholic Church in Waterloo, will continue its 15-year relationship with the organization. “We want to try and have relation-ships that we have built up with homeless people, and various vol-unteers at St. Louis Out of  e Cold have built relationships,” said Keith Schnarr, co-coordinator of St. Louis Out of the Cold. “ e region and the YWCA have told us these relationships are very important and can help the YWCA and other agencies around help get people into sustainable housing.” Overall, the message that is com-ing through during the loss of Out of the Cold is that emergency shelters and volunteer services are not per-manent solutions for the homeless persons of the region. “We weren’t going to continue to perpetuate what was happening with Out of the Cold, and hopefully keep moving the community towards long term solutions,” said Whyte. “It was a pretty complicated decision process for us, but I feel good about where the community is headed right now. It’s good to see the region getting involved and put-ting more resources into supporting those people.”Out of the Cold program strugglingHOMELESSNESSNICK LACHANCE/FILE PHOTOOver the past year, Out of the Cold has been struggling to maintain host sites. Recently, the Kitchener centre Ray of Hope decided to pull out of the program. They were the fi h host to opt out. CONNOR WARDLEAD REPORTER“We weren’t going to con-tinue to perpetuate what was happening with Out of the Cold...”-Harry Whyte, Ray of Hope CEOLocaL news   •   9WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014Waterloo city council has approved a new, futuristic development project which is meant to provide a mix of both residential and commercial space and new public corridors. The development project, involving vari-ous locations along Albert Street and Columbia Street West, will integrate student housing with retail and public space. “We’ve been looking for a mix of residential and commercial — the type of development that allows people to live and access services,” said councillor Karen Scian. “For the past eight years we’ve been working to up the quality and originality that development projects bring, that developers bring ... I felt that we were finally seeing critical traction on that goal.”The development plan was originally presented before council in January as a different project, but was not passed due to coun-cil’s issues with zoning and overall originality of the buildings. However, the developer, Prico Group, spent months redesigning the project to better outfit the community. “The contrast between what was first proposed and what was passed by council a few weeks ago was like night and day,” said councillor Mark Whaley. One reason councillors were so excited about the new project plan was that it incorporated innovative space for pedestrians in the develop-ment’s respective neighbourhoods. “You’ll see on that plan that rather than a trail or sidewalk system going around that development, they have chosen to pull pedestrian access right through the core of that development,” said Scian. “Usually, developers look at their projects as isolated rather than integrated into the community, and this develop-ment completely changed that reality.” The developments, placed at 124 and 130 Columbia St. W. and 165 Albert St., will host a large collection of infrastructure. The project encompasses the con-struction of five buildings ranging from six to 14 stories, including 600 one- to two-bedroom units, 2,250 square feet of commercial space available for rent and 283 parking spaces, most of which are under-ground. This mixture of units with fewer bedrooms and commercial space is not often seen in Waterloo. “These are one- to two-bedroom units providing a mix of uses, and really getting close to a lot of our em-ployment areas. So there’s a broader market this kind of structure can appeal to,” said councillor Jeff Henry. “Diverse neighbourhoods are strong neighbourhoods.”Overall, the development, which will also include a public am-phitheater, patio and $200,000 of developer-funded public art, are starkly different compared to exist-ing buildings in Waterloo. Modern buildings like this are a large move away from the roots of the city, but perhaps signal new trends or focuses for the region. “I was actually born on Columbia St., and when I was a boy that section of Albert and Columbia were both dirt roads,” said Whaley. “To see the 21st century come to that corner in such a grand way, for a person like me who lived by the cor-ner as a boy, is really breathtaking.”some of the candidates to discuss goals to be implemented following the election that will have a positive impact on students. Some of the issues they are touching on involve Grand River Transit, Light Rail Tran-sit, restorative justice programming and housing.“We’ve had pretty good feedback from each of the candidates we’ve met with about these ideas,” Hamade said. “So we’ll see if we can hopefully implement them going forward.”Camman said they are going to wait to see who is elected before moving forward with any goals for collaboration.“The university isn’t going any-where, so how can we best work with them to make sure that this is an even better city going forward for students and make them want to stay here after graduation,” he said.Said explained that he lives around students on Albert Street and it has made him very familiar with the student culture in Waterloo.“I live in an apartment that has a good mix — there are young people, old people, students, young profes-sionals, families and to me it builds a really good culture,” Said continued. “That’s kind of what I want to see the city developed to.”From speaking with students, he said he’s realized many feel as though they are being pushed out of the city and are unwanted. “To me that’s not what the city is about,” he said. “You should be welcome no mat-ter where you go and you should be part of that community.”If elected mayor, Said stated he is planning on implementing brown bag meetings to try and continue to facilitate communication with stu-dents and as community members at large. These are informal meetings with councillor members and the mayor would host monthly at local venues to discuss issues.“The big issue I find is that we in-vite people to city hall and when they come to city hall they have about two minutes to talk,” he said. Conversely, the brown bag meetings would allow for fuller discussions.MacDonald explained that he hasn’t had much of a chance yet to meet with students because his focus has largely been on homeown-ers. His reason for this, he said, is because homeowners are the ones who are paying taxes.“They’re the ones that you have to focus on because you have to let them know that you have their con-cerns at heart and that you’re going to work hard to keep those tax bills under control so that they can afford to stay in their homes,” he said. Many older people, he continued, have come to him concerned that if taxes rise they will have to sell their homes.In terms of student issues, MacDonald said he’s interested in hearing what their concerns are and seeing if the city can help in any way.“One of my policies as mayor is to have an open door policy and to be available and accessible to any and all who live in the city,” he said. “So I would hope that that would apply to any student who had any issue at all whether it be with a landlord or a city service, whatever it might be.”Jaworsky said he is already very familiar with the student culture in Waterloo because he was a student here. “[Students] certainly understand that I have a similar background, coming here to university. The next step for them is finding that job,” he said. “One of the key pieces of my platform is rebuilding prosperity, at-tracting jobs to Waterloo region.”In addition to attending the events hosted by the universities, Jawor-sky has been canvassing in student neighbourhoods. He explained that you just have to look at the local economy to understand why student needs need to be addressed.“The universities are responsible for $1.5 billion in gross domestic product, GDP economic activity here in our area,” he continued. “And those 50,000 students are part in parcel of that economic suc-cess. So it’s really focusing on their success, keeping the universities not cities within the city but engaged within our community and a part of our community is key to me.”Traub also has first-hand experi-ence with student issues in the city, having attained two degrees from UW. One of the issues she has heard from students is their concern over access to GRT late at night.“Classes tend to go late, people have to study late, having a bus that doesn’t show up or students — par-ticularly females — using the system on their own feel very vulnerable and unsafe,” she said. “So that’s a big issue in my mind.”Traub said it’s important for her to be reaching out into the community to interact with students because she believes this is where the solutions lie.“It’s not for council or any level of government to have an opinion about what the answer is to our problems without actually going down and talking to the people who are involved — to the stakeholders,” she said. “I’d like to get things right.”Futuristic development approvedThe new complex will combine residential and commercial spaces at Albert and Columbia StreetCandidates consider student demographiccontributed imageconnor wardlead reporterhousingfrom cover“the contrast between what was first proposed and what was passed by council a few weeks ago was like night and day.”-mark Whaley, city councillor“We’re hoping ... to see the city and the region more engaged with students in general.”-Stephane Hamade, vice president of education of the Feds at uWHeatHer davidSon/pHoto editorSaid, Jaworsky and traub attended a debate on Laurier’s campus last week, which focused on student issues.10   •   FEATURES EDITOR/ALANNA FAIREY    FEATURESWhen Sam Lambert, Wilfrid Laurier University Students’ Union president and CEO, started to question if he was gay, he reacted how most young people do: he repressed himself. “It’s not something you just kind of realize like, ‘Oh I’m gay,’” Lambert said. “I think even from when I was pretty young, like 10-15, you start having thoughts about how you might be a little more interested in men, whatever it may be. But you repress them.” e main purpose of Queer Awareness Week, which is run by the Rainbow Cen-tre and kicks o  on Oct. 7, is to encourage inclusivity and acceptance of members of the LGBTQ community.  is week is meant to help exercise acceptance and understand-ing of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer young people and the struggles that they may face in their everyday lives. Acceptance of the selfComing out is a hard thing to do, especially when the fear of being unaccepted always looms.Lambert said high school was a di  cult time for him. He said he had a few girlfriends during this time, but it was never really romantic, admitting that it got to a place where he was in these relationships to keep up appearances. “High school is also a really tough place to come out,” Lam-bert shared. “You’re kind of like, ‘Oh, I can convince myself to be straight.’”  While he was in second year, Lambert had a girlfriend for a short period of time and the two are now good friends. Karli Ferriolo, the marketing and outreach coordinator at the Rainbow Centre, shared that some students often don’t utilize the Rainbow Centre due to a fear of judgment or they do not feel entirely sure about how they feel in terms of their sexuality. “Its a personal kind of growth where you don’t want to push yourself too far if you’re not comfortable but at the same time you need to take that step,” Ferriolo said.“Everyone has their own struggles with coming to terms with their sexuality or however they want to come across. With the Rainbow Centre, we are here as a resource and we hope people on campus don’t feel intimidated by the Rainbow Centre,” she said.“Coming out is a constant and ongoing process you don’t just come out one time and that’s it. It’s a constant, recurring thing.”Ferriolo also shared that the Rainbow Cen-tre has a “no assumptions” policy, meaning that volunteers and coordinators of that space do not assume anyone’s sexuality or make the claim that anybody has to identify as queer to be a member or volunteer.“We try to always be positive and provide a learning environment so if someone comes in and they aren’t sure, there will be a discussion and conversation,” Ferriolo said. “If anyone feels that they need a private conversation, we are always here to have that talk and we are in contact with a lot of people because of our resources.” Ethan Jackson, a transgender  fth-year student, currently majoring in women and gender studies and cultural studies, said that some social rhetoric and ideologies regarding the Trans community are often mislead-ing. “For me, I was never born in the wrong body,” Jackson said. “ is is who I am.”However, Jackson admitted that he felt some discomfort with himself and the way others perceived him. “Growing up, I did feel uncomfortable with a lot of the ways that I was kind of seeing myself and how others were seeing myself,” Jackson said. Lambert realized that he could not keep denying who he was and told one of the dons that he had been working with. Within a month, Lambert had come out to his family and friends. Leading up to coming out, Lambert shared that he needed emotional and mental strength, all while trying to stop the worst-case scenarios from playing in his head. However, he knew it had to be done.“Mentally it’s very tiring and it just kind of creeps into every-thing you do like work and school, like this one all-encompassing thing that’s takes all of your time,” Lambert said. “So coming out and  nally saying it, even though I was in a pretty good place and was comfortable with myself, its like a whole weight is lifted o  your shoulders.” Inevitable insensitivity Whether it is intentional or not, the issue of insensitivity is one that continues to be a continuous hurdle in the LGBTQ commu-nity.With the unceasing evolution of language, there are some terms that are more preferred than others.  is can cause some di  culty if someone is unsure about how to address someone.  “Language is constantly changing and constantly evolving because new terms are being added for old ones that are problem-atic and its something that you need to keep on top of,” Ferriolo explained.“ e term ‘queer’ used to be used as a slur and now the queer community is reclaiming that term to be more inclusive.”In some unfortunate cases, there are incidences where homo-phobic slurs are intentional.  e phrase “that’s so gay” is still used to describe something depicted as stupid or disliked. “As members of the LGBTQ community, we have to be con -dent enough and willing to have a conversation with someone,” Lambert said. “I think that might be di  cult because we are already a minor-ity already but I think Laurier is the best place, if anywhere, to speak out.” Lambert admitted that he was recently involved in a situation with someone he went to high school with while he was at Wilf’s. Lambert described the situation as being very heated, as this per-son was very vocal about his views on Lambert’s homosexuality. “ is person was talking about how they didn’t agree with my lifestyle and that it was wrong and that it was against god,” Lam-bert said. e day after the incident, Lambert said he made sure to sur-round himself with the people that meant the most to him so he could re ect on the situation.“It was not the best experience, obviously, but I think it’s one that makes you stronger and now I know how to deal with those situations better, but it was tough.”Jackson recalled an incident when he was in  rst-year where people from his residence had been drinking and asked him in-sensitive questions regarding sexual activities and his genitalia. “It’s a culture that really needs to shift their ways of thinking,” Jackson said. “I had to realize that these people wanted nothing to do with me; they were just curious.” Lambert stressed the importance of not making assumptions regarding one’s sexual orientation or identity and to be mindful of language and how one might prefer to be identi ed. “I think we are getting to a point where assuming that I have a girlfriend isn’t the right thing to do,” Lambert said. “You have to be careful with the kind of language you use, so “Coming out is a constant and ongoing process, you don’t just come out one time and that’s it.”-Karli Ferriolo, marketing and outreach coordinator at the Rainbow CentreA ‘constant and ongoing process’With Queer Awareness Week starting this week, Features editor Alanna Fairey sheds light on the LGBTQ community at Wilfrid Laurier UniversityFEATURES WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014   •   11nity.With the unceasing evolution of language, there are some terms that are more preferred than others. \b is can cause some di\u0007  culty if someone is unsure about how to address someone.  “Language is constantly changing and constantly evolving because new terms are being added for old ones that are problem-atic and its something that you need to keep on top of,” Ferriolo explained.“\b e term ‘queer’ used to be used as a slur and now the queer community is reclaiming that term to be more inclusive.”In some unfortunate cases, there are incidences where homo-phobic slurs are intentional. \b e phrase “that’s so gay” is still used to describe something depicted as stupid or disliked. “As members of the LGBTQ community, we have to be con -dent enough and willing to have a conversation with someone,” Lambert said. “I think that might be di\u0007  cult because we are already a minor-ity already but I think Laurier is the best place, if anywhere, to speak out.” Lambert admitted that he was recently involved in a situation with someone he went to high school with while he was at Wilf’s.

I think language is a really good place to start.”The power of support Although Lambert’s intention wasn’t to come out to the  rst-year students during his speech at the opening ceremonies during Ori-entation Week, he did so because he wanted to impact students with something that would have impacted him as a  rst-year. “It wasn’t just about coming out it was about being who you are and be able to grow into the person you really want to be at this school, so I think from that it became easier to relate it to myself,” Lambert said. “I think when you give it a personal touch, it’s relatable for people who are debating not only coming out but also for those who are masking who they are in some other way.”Lambert also made himself available to students who are hav-ing a hard time coming to terms with their sexuality or under-standing how they feel. \b e Rainbow Centre fosters an educational aspect into all inquiries that people may have about the centre or their own sexuality. Coordinators help to set students up with the proper resources and support as needed.“We are here for peer support, so if anyone felt like they needed someone to talk with. If it had to do with the coming out aspect, we are always here to talk and if they had questions, we would set them up with the resources,” Ferriolo explained.\b ough he did not use the Rainbow Centre personally, Lambert has praised its value for being a safe haven for the gay community and promoting inclusivity and awareness. Jackson praised it for being a “liaison” for the  rst steps towards the proper resources needed. For some, the support of family and friends is enough. After coming out, Lambert was overwhelmed with the positive support he had from his family and friends. He considered himself lucky to be able to openly talk to his family about it if he were to have a bad day or a negative experience.“I was lucky enough to have a positive experience coming out, but not everyone will.”Unfortunately, not everyone has the support of their family af-ter coming out. Jackson admitted to having a negative experience coming out as trans to his family, as they were not accepting and believed it was a phase. Although he and his family do not have a relationship, Jackson is thankful for his loyal group of friends, whom he identi es as his “chosen family.” “I have a really  erce and fabulous set of friends who I can call up any time and it’s really lovely to have that kind of community,” Jackson said.“It makes you more aware of what you’ve gone through and to understand your hardships when you had people around you and you didn’t realize it at that point but now that you see it, when someone else is having a bad day, you know how they feel.”‘Everything becomes crystal clear’ \b e increase of awareness has generated more of an acceptance of the LGBTQ community.Although there are still isolated incidences of homophobia and intolerance of the LGBTQ community within some universi-ties, the call for education has helped many people recognize that there are other ways of living. “Our campaigns and discussions are a great way for people to become more aware and understand that there is not just heterosexu-ality,” Ferriolo said.  “Sexual diversity exists everywhere, it’s just a matter of opening your eyes to it.” However, there is still much work that can still be done. Jackson believes that a lot of it has to do with understanding that people are just people, no matter who they are. “I don’t think that we are going to  nish this tomorrow,” Jackson said. “We are not there yet but we are making huge stratas to get there.” Before coming out and accepting his sexuality, Lambert used the metaphor of how he was living life without contacts. Meta-phorically  nding those contacts has enriched his life.“It was like I was living life without glasses and everything was just blurry and then when you come out, everything becomes crystal clear. Everything just has more value,” Lambert said.“I think it just allowed me to be happy in everything I’m doing. It allowed me to live my life like it’s 20/20 vision.”A ‘constant and ongoing process’With Queer Awareness Week starting this week, Features editor Alanna Fairey sheds light on the LGBTQ community at Wilfrid Laurier University“As members of the LGBTQ community, we have to be confident enough and will-ing to have a conversation with someone.”-Sam Lambert, Students’ Union president and CEOFILE PHOTOS BY NICK LACHANCE12   •   WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014Arts & Life ARTS & LIFE EDITORBRYAN STEPHENS FOODLessons learnedADVICEMaking the most out of student mealsIf you haven’t already noticed, students are not the most glamorous eaters. I’m not talking about the way in which we eat, but the actual meals we consume each and every day. \u0005 e average student’s diet consists mainly of quick, cheap and easy food that, even though delicious, can get boring after a while. \u0005 ese foods can include generic eats like pizza, Kraft Dinner, soup, pasta, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and so on. \u0005 e trouble is that we as students are so stuck in our instant meal ways that making an original culinary cre-ation is usually out of the question.However, there is a happy me-dium. It is possible to take boring student meals and add in some easy, yet delicious, ways to dress them up. \u0005 is way, you can still enjoy the food you’re comfortable making while switching it up just enough to make it interesting. Kraft dinner is the student meal of all student meals. \u0005 is macaroni and cheese dish is the example all your relatives use when they ask you if you have been eating healthy or are having too many bowls of golden noodles. To spice up this residence life standard, you can boil a hot dog, slice it up and mix it in to the golden goodness; this will give it some more texture and hardiness, while remind-ing you of your childhood at the same time. You can also mix in some bacon crumble or cubed ham. If you want to go even more radical than that, you can grab some bread, throw it in the toaster and crumble it on top. \u0005 is may seem strange, but an extra crunch to the soft noodles is more than satisfying. \u0005 ink of it as your KD’s very own croutons. Soup is almost too easy to make. Whether it’s Mr. Noodles or a Camp-bell’s cup, soups of any variety can taste good but can get old quickly. \u0005 ey get so bland after just one semester that sometimes it feels like the broth has turned into lukewarm bathwater. To counteract the soup sadness, try putting in some hot sauce. Add-ing in a dash or two of Tabasco or Sriracha can transform your boring soup into the realest meal. You can also toss in some bread, basil or even your own vegetables to give it more of a boost. Not drastic enough? Grab a bag of Tostitos and break o  some pieces and drop them in the soup. \u0005 is will help give it more texture and a hardier  nish. Grilled cheese can get dull pretty fast. Don’t let it get to the point where this bread and cheese combo becomes tasteless and it feels like you are eating paper. If you’ve got the funds to get brie cheese, toss that in along with some apple slices for the perfect afternoon pick-me-up. Even easier than that though, is to toss some cold cuts in between those slices of bread and voila; the greatest grilled cheese. With these suggestions in mind, it can be easy to add some excitement to even the simplest of dishes. While not limited to these options, explor-ing what is in your pantry already can also be a great place to  nd the inspiration to make your cheap meals taste much better.As a child, life was a big playground — you were being told that you could be anything you wanted to be. We took life with a light heart, and ultimately the world was ours to imagine. Discipline was a critical part of childhood. We started by learning how to sit quietly, how to listen to the teacher without interrupting, how to share with others, to wait our turn and how to get along with our peers. What we learned from these things is how to interact within society in an acceptable way. As we get older we realize we learned these things so we can be decent people. \u0005 e way we are raised as children shapes who we are and how we think as adults. But the big question is, do we as adults still hold those values and les-sons we learn as children? Growing up as an only child to a single mother taught me a lot as a person. Not only did I learn how to be creative and imaginative, but I was also taught to be independent, ambitious and strong-minded — all values that I still carry with me today. To this day every conversation I have with my mother turns into a lesson. I am sure most of us can all relate to this one way or another; what feels like a lecture ends up be-ing a great life lesson. One of the biggest lessons I learned was that in order to achieve something in life you have to be resilient and persistent, but most importantly, patient. Everything you receive in life you have to earn because nothing in life comes easily. \u0005 ese are not the exact words my mom would use to me as a child. Let’s face it, I would not have had a clue what that meant. But this message is something I learned through discipline. For instance, going into a store and see-ing a toy or treat I wanted and every time I would ask I got hit with “no.” And once I started acting up, not only would I get “the look,” but for sure I knew I would not leave that store with a single thing. But with good behaviour, I knew that a treat would come to me at another time. When I decoded this scenario, I can see how it related to my life now. Sometimes I want everything and I want it at that moment. But I realized I have to work at it because that is the only way for me to get what I want. It doesn’t exactly mean that I cannot or will not get what I desire, it just means that I probably won’t get it instantly. Ultimately, the things we learn as children may not have a direct im-pact on our decisions as adults, but these lessons have a subtle in uence on how we think about life.

Despite being based in Toronto, the members first met in the Mari-times. Rankin said that choosing Toronto over other cities was an easy choice.“Toronto’s pretty central and our French is crap,” she said.The band broke into the scene earlier this year with their self-titled debut album, an irresistible col-lection of hook-driven jangle-pop tunes that are sure to be on your next summer playlist.  With such a strong debut came a quickly expanding fan base — it’s no wonder the band went to number one on the college charts earlier this year.“If literate kids are listening to you, you can’t really ask for much more,” O’Hanley said.Critics have labeled Alvvays’ sound with a multitude of genres, but the band is confident in where they stand in the music world. “We think it’s pretty unimpeach-able pop,” O’Hanley said. “It’s this syrupy exterior — and a lot of people just see that — but if you spend a couple IQ points on div-ing in there, there’s more to be had.”Opening their set at Starlight Social Club in uptown Waterloo with the crowd-pleaser “Atop a Cake,” fans stripped away their denim jackets and quickly rushed the stage. The energy was sustained with a punchier rendition of “Ones Who Love You” and fan-favourite “Adult Diversion,” a song that beckons for the perfect summer afternoon.From there, the pace slowed for “The Agency Group,” a swooning song perfectly fit for the intimate setting.“That’s my favourite song, it sounds the best,” Rankin said.The way the songs translated from the album to the stage was seamless. Not only are they sonically accurate, but the band’s personality shined throughout the performance. The laissez-faire attitude and the organically awkward on-stage chem-istry between Rankin and O’Hanley made for the perfect backdrop to their set.The band kept the audience guess-ing what would be next with a hand-ful of B-sides and a cover.  A track that stood out was “Underneath Us,” a song soaked in distortion and reverb, with synth and a droning beat that hypnotized. Over such a weighted backing, Rankin repeated the hook with a certain lethargy that entranced the audience.  The change in tone exemplified the band’s breadth and ambition to explore various sounds.“We try not to shoehorn ourselves into anything — we like to be eclectic pop, pop that you can do anything you want with,” O’Hanley said.As the show grew to a close, Alv-vays ended off the night with their hit “Archie, Marry Me” —  an uncon-ventional love story of crime, akin to Bonnie and Clyde. The energy of the crowd reached new heights as the first “hey heys” were sung and didn’t cease until the final strum.It was smiles all around for the fans and band alike.“Any time you can see a lot of people and not individuals, it’s amazing. You know you’re going to have a good show,” Rankin said.Alvvays’ performance came at the perfect time, as Waterloo was in desperate need of one last hit of summer. Zach Guitorcord arts & lifeWith the release and critical acclaim of David Fincher’s new film adapta-tion of the bestseller novel Gone Girl, the sheer volume of book adapta-tions in modern cinema is once again brought to our attention. Ever since the beginning of the 2000s, with the enormous intake of the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films, there has been a surge of books being turned into movies in the hopes of being the next big thing, with some being successful — The Bourne Identity, The Hunger Games — and others such as Ender’s Game and Let Me In not as much. Of course cinema has never been a stranger to media transference. After all, how many movie ver-sions of Dracula or any of Shake-speare’s plays have been made in the past hundred years? But with this decade-plus boom, the ultimate question arises: is taking a book and turning it into a film a good thing for the content of the original material?I would say it is, but it depends heavily on the approach of those making a film. Iconic French direc-tor Francois Truffaut once wrote, “I demand that a film express either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema. I am not at all interested in anything in between.” A similar principle applies to the art of adapting a work. When love and respect for material shines through, it can actively heighten what made the original work good, while at the same time condensing it for a more approachable consumption. Likewise, when the adaptors take a harshly critical look at the source, it can create something that won’t please fans but work as an effective piece on its own terms. Take the aforementioned Lord of the Rings trilogy. Considering the amount of passion and effort that went into bringing Tolkien’s creation to life, from the set designs to the au-dacious directing approach, it’s clear that Peter Jackson and company had a strong desire to do justice to the source. Still, they could see what wouldn’t work in a movie and what just flat-out didn’t work in the original books, such as ultimately extraneous characters and tedious descriptive asides, and had the wisdom to leave it out. By being critical of the thing they love, they were able to get to the heart of what it was trying to accom-plish as well as improving upon it.On the opposite end, you have The Wolf of Wall Street, which in turn was essentially a book-length brag into an analysis of Jordan Belfort and what his success means for society. Like Lord of the Rings it understands the original material, but unlike those films it has a firm distaste for that material. It portrayed Belfort as selfish, buffoonish and downright abusive, with his cohorts not being much better. Where something like The Godfa-ther took a book and cut most of the material to focus on the good parts, The Wolf of Wall Street looks at the original text and spends three hours scoffing at it. However, with this criticism comes daringness comparable to the text-admiring — but still individu-alistic approach — Alfonso Cuarón took to Harry Potter and the Pris-oner of Azkaban. Love can be just as strong a feeling as hate, and both can do wonders when presenting a take on a subject. What we as book-readers and film-goers have to fear the most when it comes to adaptation is not divergence; it’s apathy. Year after year listless and uncaring adapta-tions like The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and every Twilight after the first one — which at least had some semblance of a unique touch — come out and feel like nothing more than magnets for fans and you can just sense the lack of interest in the source material from everyone involved. Authors are able to show their love for what they craft easier than filmmakers because of how much lone creative control they have, but for the people making these movies, to not care at all is their biggest crime against the original work. If you go in with an open mind, films based on books can be great because of what they change as well as what they don’t. So fans of the book Gone Girl : go with an open mind. Adaptation can be good for the source materials — we just need to get the right people to do it.chris DonalDstaff WriterCoping in the age of adaptationAnimAlsshannon millar/Graphic artistPets can be ‘ruff’Alvvays bring the smilesGoing away to school and leaving the comfort of your home can be a big adjustment for some students. The answer for many Wilfrid Laurier University students to adjust easier is to get a pet to accompany them. Last year I fell into the cycle of wanting a pet. I happily purchased a betta fish, Sushi, complete with bowl, plants and seashells. Eight months later, I put Sushi up for adoption on Facebook. That’s right, all I had to do was feed it twice a day and clean its bowl, and it was too much work for me — I was officially over my pet craze.What was surprising was the vast amount of comments I received of people desperately wanting to take the fish. Sure a fish is hardly any respon-sibility, but there are some brave students at Laurier who are taking on a whole lot more than fish. If you’re living alone, having a pet is no inconvenience to fellow room-mates, or if you buy the pet with them it’s smooth sailing. This was the case for third-year Laurier student Marci Figueredo and her boyfriend Trevor Auiler, who made the deci-sion to buy a pug last April.Having their own house with a spacious backyard is puppy paradise. However, it’s not all bones and kibble. “Dogs pee and poop everywhere and they are a lot of maintenance. Sometimes you just don’t have time for that,” said Figueredo. Auiler also pointed out it can be very expensive owning a puppy. Dealing with roommates who have pets you didn’t sign up for can be challenging; Alex Sheehan, a third-year business student can at-test to this. Her roommate Lisa Por-ter, an economics student, decided to bring her cat Mercedes to their shared apartment this year. Sheehan is not a fan of the cat, as she is allergic and often has to leave the apartment because of it. “I try to keep her in my room when I’m not at home and I make sure the couches are vacuumed and sweep as much as possible,” said Porter. Getting a pet in university may be a good bonding experience and as Figueredo points out, “They’re so loving and cheer you up when you’re stressed.” However, the added responsibility may not be ideal for everyone.On top of exams, work schedules and having a social life, having a pet while being a student may be too much to take on. Sure — having an animal in your apartment may sound like the best idea — but the reality of having to clean up after them and the expense might be more than you expect, and not always fair to your pet or your roommates. Here’s some advice: start out with a fish. If the fish is too much for you, it’s time to say goodbye to the dream of having an adorable little puppy while being a student and stick to drooling over pet pictures on Instagram.

I use it myself on a daily basis for a multitude of reasons. From check-ing e-mails to doing research for assignments and streaming music and movies, the Internet plays an important role in my ability on each of these tasks.With the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web this year, regula-tion of the Internet has — on the whole — remained the same. As outlined by the Federal Communica-tions Commission, the Internet has until this point, “Made it possible for anyone, anywhere to easily launch innovative applications and services, revolutionizing the way people com-municate, participate, create and do business.”What the FCC is trying to say in a nutshell is the Internet can be built and supported by anyone that wishes to do so. This is the basic tenet behind what net neutrality is: the content produced online reflects what people want to access, create and share with people around the world.The Canadian government has helped support this paradigm as well. Bill C-552, or an Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (In-ternet Neutrality), was introduced in 2008. It was stated within that, “Network operators shall not engage in network management practices that favor, degrade or prioritize any content, application or service trans-mitted over a broadband network based on its source, ownership or destination.”This allowed for the principle of fair access for Canadian users to be held and maintained within a legal framework.From a theoretical stand-point, net neutrality sounds like the best way to regulate the Internet. By allowing those who use the Internet to help create and curate the content, people around the world could still use the service to the fullest degree. Net neutrality also tries to prevent the idea of premium costs online. By not favouring content from service providers, users should not be charged for using some services over others.  Access and the use of video services like YouTube and Hulu should not be obstructed or have a surcharge added for being classified as “premium.” But some have been challenging net neutrality in CanadaThroughout 2014, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommuni-cations Commission have dealt with various cases in which Canadian users’ access to content has been tested. One of the most recent cases for the CRTC has been trying to gain jurisdiction over how Netflix can be operated in Canada. What the current battle between Netflix and the CRTC points out is how corporations are pushing back against legislation that attempt to limit their services. In September, Netflix refused to provide Canadian content and subscriber information upon request from the CRTC. They argued releasing such information would have consequences inconsis-tent with the interests of consumers.While Netflix does point out it shouldn’t have to conform to juris-diction from outside of their host nation of the United States, some parties, such as the Writers Guild of Canada, feel that imposing fees on Netflix helps promote Canadian content. I could argue that trying to man-date the distribution of Canadian content on video services like Netflix is an argument in which the CRTC will lose. I could also join the thou-sands of Canadian voices that see the CRTC as a dinosaur in the chang-ing media landscape that refuses to adapt to the times. But the real issue goes back to what lies at the core of net neutrality: access.The CRTC’s job is to ensure that, “Communication laws designed to protect the public interest are respected.” And that is really what lies at the heart of the Net neutrality debate. The matter of access boils down to the ability of any user to use their preferred online service for do-ing any number of tasks. Trying to regulate the Internet is what takes the “freedom” out of freedom of information. Net neutrality might not be easy to initially grasp, but by making an effort to understand it, people can realize how important it truly is.Sexist pajamas, Jane Eyre and a gender-equal worldBryan StephenSArts And Life editorFrom a theoretical stand-point, net neutrality sounds like the best way to regu-late the internet.In Jane Eyre, a novel by Charlotte Bronte, the protagonist, Jane Eyre, expressed her frustration with what she perceived to be an unequal gen-der hegemonic structure. She eloquently stated that, “Women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-crea-tures to say that they ought to con-fine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.” It has been 167 years and two World Wars since the first publica-tion of Jane Eyre, but the gender inequalities she vented about are still very much prevalent, although argu-ably to a lesser, more subtle degree. Recently, this inequality was man-ifested through the sale of infants’ pajamas at a local Target store. A professor at the University of Waterloo tweeted a photo of two of these pajamas and since then, they have gone viral, sparking a heated debate on Twitter and beyond. The first pajama, intended for boys, read, “Future man of steel.” The second pajama, intended for girls, read, “I only date heroes.”  These pajamas may seem innocu-ous at first glance, and some of us may even feel like we could get them for our own kids; but on second glance, and upon deeper thought, they become an obvious representa-tion of the little ways in which gender stereotypes are perpetuated. They also point our attention to something we’ve always known, but perhaps find difficult to admit: that imbalances in gender representa-tions have become so engrained within us that we often miss the most blatant evidences. Hence, ours is a society that is conveniently trapped in a hyperreal-ity of gender inequality. The pajamas enforce the miscued narrative of the strong, independent, paternalistic man and the subor-dinate, dependent, emotionally stimulated woman. But we must understand, as Jane Eyre put it, that women are no better or worse than men and no more or less capable than them. And once we begin to understand this simple fact, we will be better equipped to break out of the hyper-reality of gender inequality. Most importantly, we will be able to recognize, at first glance, the several little ways in which miscued gender stereotypes are manifested. It must be said that it is important to have these kinds of conversations about our interactions with products and commodities surrounding us. We believe that for as long as con-versations such as these are being had, there is much to be optimistic about and perhaps the gender equal world Jane Eyre conceived of can become less fictional and more real. Over the last week, LinkedIn released a document that ranked universities in Canada according to five criteria: accounting, finance, investment banking, marketing and software development. These rankings were based on “the career paths of LinkedIn members,” and its aim was to find out which schools are “best at launching gradu-ates into desirable jobs.” To reach their conclusions, Linke-dIn assessed the profiles of “millions of alumni” in order to figure out what percentage of them had received jobs at top employers in the five criteria listed. Wilfrid Laurier University, to the delight of many at the school, was ranked second in two of those criteria: marketing and investment banking. What this means essentially is that when compared to other universi-ties, more graduates from Wilfrid Laurier University were able to land jobs in investment banking and mar-keting at top corporations. Hence, the rankings reflect the university’s ability to prepare stu-dents for desirable jobs after they graduate. These rankings mean a lot for the reputation of the university and it gives its students much to be excited about. However, it points us yet again to what we perceive as an ever-growing focus in Canada on business profes-sions and professionals, and the ever-decreasing focus on other fields or areas of interest. Moreover, this study was done in order to help high school students decide which universities best suit them. Nonetheless, more needs to be done to help students interested in pursuing arts degrees make deci-sions about their education. Our university administration should take note of this especially consider-ing the drop in arts admissions in the last year. Hence, they should take advan-tage of successful arts alumni, and use them as examples in order to attract prospective students. LinkedIn has become a ubiquitous medium in the job search process, but more often than not, it alienates those outside the business world. While it may be very helpful to business students or business gradu-ates, it is perceived by many outside this sphere as less accommodating, or worse, useless. But it does not have to be so. It could be very helpful to people from a wide range of academic and pro-fessional backgrounds. But for this to become a reality, we must find a convenient equilibrium in our deal-ings with this issue, and tailor our services to apply not only to business professionals, but also to those of other backgrounds. What the LinkedIn university rankings really representOn my way to class on Oct. 2, I was met with a surprise. I noticed some-one had taken the time to write mes-sages along the sidewalk on campus in chalk. I saw about eight of these that said such things as “Abortion Hurts Women #Prolife” and “Abortion Is Murder.” About two hours later on my journey back, I realized someone else had taken chalk of their own and altered some of the writings. This showed me what I already knew — that hot button topics like this are on people’s minds, regard-less of how many politicians insist the issue is settled.Personally, this is my defining is-sue. I can never support a candidate who professes to be pro-choice over one who’s pro-life. As time goes on and I get to debate more, I become more certain that my pro-life stance is the right one.I’ve heard all of the arguments and it’s becoming increasingly frustrating to watch the clichés dominate the public discourse.To begin, let’s drop the myths. Abortion is not explicitly legal in Canada. In fact, we are the only Western nation without a law regard-ing abortion. When people claim that our Su-preme Court deems it as a right, they are blatantly wrong.  With that in mind, my argument is simple. Whatever a woman is carry-ing inside of her, we know it’s living; if it’s living that means it’s a life. We also know that this life has unique and distinctly human DNA, therefore making it a human being. Finally, because they are human, they are protected under section seven of our Charter of Rights and Freedoms.So here’s where the criticism begins. First of all, we have people who say no one truly knows when life begins. United States President Barack Obama claimed something similar in 2008 when asked. He said, “Answering that ques-tion with specificity is above my pay grade.” This argument can easily be dismissed on the grounds that if we don’t know when life begins, then allowing abortion to proceed is reckless, because we could be killing people and not even know it. Following that is the inevitable question pro-choice advocates ask, “What happens if the woman gets raped or if her life is at risk from pregnancy?” This is a very reasonable question, but then you realize the people ask-ing are completely disingenuous. These grisly scenarios make up less than one per cent of abortions, and if you reply saying you would allow abortion in those cases, the pro-choice side quickly backtracks to saying they still want abortion legal. It’s nothing more than a ploy to make the pro-life side look extreme. Another clichéd argument comes from the idea that if the baby is born into a poor family, it will live a ter-rible life. But last time I checked, even poor people are glad they’re alive, not wishing they were killed. And we’re talking about first-world Canada, where there’s a surplus of people wanting to adopt and would be more than happy to have a baby. No one should have the right to judge the potential quality of some-one’s life and use that as justification to kill him or her.  There’s also a rampantly sexist argument some like to use in order to shut down the pro-life side — that men for some reason don’t have the privilege to have an opinion. Ignoring the fact that massive amounts of pro-life support comes from women, just imagine if Justin Trudeau said to someone, “I’m addressing men’s issues. You’re a woman and you’re not qualified for this discussion.” He’d rightfully be called out for such a dreadfully sexist remark. We’re Canadians, and no voice should ever be silenced for reasons of sex, race, class or religion. Abortion is an appalling practice that needs to be stopped. Everyone has decisions, but ending an inno-cent life shouldn’t be one of them. In most cases, women don’t just suddenly become pregnant. Choices are made leading up to conception that both parents should be respon-sible for. Canada is a caring country of strong social cohesion and safety nets. It’s time we do the right thing.    •   17WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8 , 2014Opinion opinion editormoyosore arewa2014 has had its fair share of alterca-tions and cases of domestic abuse, from the video that emerged of Solange Knowles assaulting Jay-Z in an elevator, to the case of Christy Mack and Janay Palmer, who were attacked by ex-boyfriend Jonathan Koppenhaver and fiancé Ray Rice, respectively. These incidents, naturally, have spawned a multitude of reactions from various people and groups all over the world. Celebrities, feminists and casual Internet users were all quick to ex-press their feelings about many of these incidents. Reactions ranged from extreme distaste to the occasional justifica-tion, which is admittedly off-putting.Justifiers, or abuse apologists as I like to call them, are not always blatant with their rationalization of situations. Their views are mostly covertly phrased through questions and statements such as: “What did he or she do to deserve this?” Or “It really wasn’t that bad.” Speculation is not a crime and is often a characteristic of our curious nature, but only focusing and bring-ing attention to whatever action brought about a violent act ultimate-ly amounts to placing some form of blame on the victim. Excluding self-defence, is there any action that should warrant abuse of any form?One particularly interesting term I came upon was “love tap,” which was used in reference to when Palmer, as evidenced by the released video, seemed to initiate a physical act against Rice. “Love” is a term of endearment and a “tap” is essentially a light slap. A tap could be an accurate descrip-tion of the act, but when it is coupled with love to describe a conflict, one can’t help but see how it downplays the deed. A slap and a knockout punch might not inflict the same amount of damage, but one would not exist without the other and they are both violent acts.Justification is not only limited to such terms; people have also ex-pressed the sentiment behind them through language and phrasing. More often than not, they would insist on citing Christy Mack’s profession as an adult actress in a passive-aggressive manner, as if that has anything to do with her broken teeth and fractured rib. I read a piece that spent some time detailing why the Solange/Jay-Z incident didn’t constitute domestic abuse — which is true, but isn’t par-ticularly relevant to the case. Discussions solely centered on the semantics of abuse typically end up derailing the actual conversation, which is about someone who was the victim of unwanted physical contact. This is not to say that details surrounding abuse are always un-necessary. They provide context and enable a greater understanding of the situation, especially in the court of law. Moreover, the sex of the victim can also be an important detail due to the staggering amount of violence carried out yearly against women. Canadian women are 11 times more likely to be victims of sexual violence than men, and about 3,300 women are forced to stay nightly in shelters to avoid abuse. A violent act of any kind takes the contentious issue at play and trivializes it. This trivialization isn’t a result of the pre-existing issue becoming unimportant, but rather as a result of how destructive and vast the effects of violence are. It’s akin to being upset about something and going on to punch the wall in your apartment repeat-edly. Hitting the wall might be emotion-ally relieving, but the outcome is not only a sprained wrist, but also a broken wall. Violence is a slippery slope that ultimately leads to even more problems.It is important to monitor the language brought into discussions of abuse. Talking about abuse is a sensitive undertaking and requires a certain level of prudence. We need to stick to the fundamen-tals of humanitarian principles and call it as it is.Efa abrahamOpiniOn COlumnistCanadian women are 11 times more likely to be victims of sexual violence than men...Contributed photoCalling it as it isSpEncEr gibaraOpiniOn COlumnist A case against abortionI recently decided to teach my little sister that she needs to love herself. She is five and it’s a daunting task, but I see a world trying to invade her impressionable mind. Let me begin, however, by giving you a background of my childhood. I was never one of those children raised on television, but I did watch a fair amount. I looked forward to completing my homework before the glowing screen as SpongeBob performed his usual antics. However, SpongeBob is not the reason I need to teach my sister to love herself. It was what came on during those commercial breaks that affected me; I saw ads featuring golden-haired, blue-eyed children playing with dolls that resembled them in the most basic sense. Rarely did I see a girl who re-sembled me, playing with a curly haired doll that could have been a grown-up version of myself.. This advertisement may seem miniscule, but it becomes grave when multiplied with years of im-ages that represent an ideal of beauty that looks nothing like what I saw when I looked in the mirror. That was my plight and that is often the plight of those who grow up as a minority. That said, I am not pleading for more ethnically diverse Barbie dolls in the hopes that their skin colour or hair texture will lend to better self-image in our girls. We are still faced with the ridicu-lously thin images that do very little to help the self-esteem of girls who will never grow up to be size double-zeros.I am merely explicating a series of subconscious messages that were delivered to me from the time I could distinguish the difference between ugly and pretty. It’s estimated that advertisers spend $12 billion to get children to watch at least 40,000 commercials a year, not including other forms of media.  So it comes as no surprise that I quickly learned — albeit indirectly -- that to be beautiful, one had to have straight, long hair, thin features, moderate height and for the most part, white skin. Now, I don’t believe there is an objective standard of beauty, but as a child these images became the cornerstone of my shaky self-esteem. No one should feel the need to grow up to be an industry’s definition of perfection.I was faced with a decision: either I could strive to become this ideal and bleach my skin, deny my culture, fry my curly locks and eat like a bird, or I could accept who I was without any reservations. The journey to the latter is ongo-ing. Some days, the media seems like a force of nature. I cannot run or hide from it telling me that I am not good, pretty, smart or worthy enough. What I can do, however, is teach my little sister to skip the step I had to take. I can help her reject the ideals put forth by the media and society and teach her to embrace the beauty in herself. Like I said, it’s easier said than done. She has media and advertis-ing coming at her from more screens than I did. I want to fight this onslaught by telling her simply that she is smart and unique in her own way. I want to explain that it’s okay to be fat, thin, White, Black, Asian, First Nation and everything in between and outside of the labels we put on each other. I want to teach her that our diversity and uniqueness should be celebrated, not minimized. I want to teach her that she doesn’t need the media to validate her worth. She is only five, and brightly enamoured by a world that has yet to show its fangs to her. I want to soften the blows she is sure to encounter. I want to teach her that she doesn’t have to be hard-ened or naive; she can love herself and free herself to love others in the process. I want to teach her because I wish someone had taught me.

The Wilfrid Laurier University men’s baseball team battled the ele-ments and themselves while drop-ping both games versus the Brock Badgers on Sunday afternoon. They fell 6-1 and 6-5 respectively in a bout for the top spot in Ontario University Athletics. Brett Van Pelt was handed his first loss of the season in game one of the doubleheader. He effectively deployed a fastball-changeup com-bination, yielding six strikeouts to bring his total to a league-leading 40 on the year. However, he left after six and one third innings, down 3-1. Despite his strikeout milestone, Van Pelt was not pleased with the result. “I didn’t really have my ‘A’ stuff today – I was struggling with my command a little bit,” he said. “Noah [Ivanyi] bailed me out, he came in and got those guys out and kept it 3—1 and gave us a chance to win in the back end of the game. That’s all you can ask, really.”However, the Hawks bullpen was unable to keep the game close, surrendering three more runs in the loss. Andrew Ziedins was the starter for the second end of the double header. Ziedins, who was coming off a complete game effort in his last start, struggled early. But head coach Scott Ballantyne spoke highly of his junior starter’s ability to maintain his composure and persevere through adversity.“Andrew’s a great pitcher, he’s really a bulldog out there,” said Bal-lantyne.“He’s really emerged as our num-ber three starter which is what we’re going to need going into the playoffs. He gives us a chance to win every time he pitches,” he said. “He bared down and got us into the seventh inning and you can’t ask more than that.”Laurier struggled to control the Brock running game early, allowing stolen bases abound. The Badgers’ loud, aggressive style of baseball can be abrasive, and at several points the Golden Hawks voiced their displea-sure with the Badger bench. This, when compounded with controversial umpiring, led to a tense, angry atmosphere on the Laurier side. Nonetheless, Ballantyne asserted that they try to tune out distractions and focus on their own game.“Brock’s a team that’s a lot similar to us—they play a lot of the same style as us, and we know they’re going to be vocal whenever we play them,” he said. “We just have to worry about focusing in on our own baseball and not worrying about what they’re doing.”With the Golden Hawks’ winning streak snapped, their eyes now lie on next weekend’s matchup with Queen’s and further yet, the playoffs.Two wins against the Gaels would clinch second place and a first-round bye in the playoffs, which take place at McMaster’s Bernie Arbour Stadium.But neither Ballantyne nor Van Pelt seemed ready to settle for the team’s already favourable placement in the OUA standings, and felt there was much to be worked on over the Hawks’ final week of baseball prior to the playoffs.“We’ve been trying to get better and better every week. We know that we have to get a little bit better in terms of moving runners along when we have less than two outs and run-ners on base,” said Ballantyne. “We battled today, but we’ve defi-nitely got to be better,” said Van Pelt. “Take tomorrow off, and get back out Tuesday at practice.” Laurier’s final regular season games come against a 6-5 Queen’s team fresh off back-to-back thrash-ings to Brock and Ryerson.Losing the battle for firstbaseballRecord set by Right to Play LaurierHandballwill prowse cord sports Josh peterssports Editor Last Wednesday, Wilfrid Laurier University’s Right to Play club par-ticipated in Martin Parnell’s Canada Quest for Kids, where he is going to 10 universities across Canada and attempting to break 10 world records to raise money for the charity. 57-year-old Parnell made national and international news in 2010 for completing 250 marathons in a single year. Ever since, then he has been dedi-cated to using sport to raise money for charity. He is using Right to Play as a me-dium for his next project. He began in British Columbia with a record—setting volleyball game and is making his way to St. John’s Newfoundland to play ice hockey.Laurier was his fifth stop on the tour, and his goal was to set the re-cord for the world’s largest recorded handball game, with 100 people participating. Student volunteers and executive members of Right to Play helped Parnell accomplish his goal last week at University Stadium.Each participant had to contribute $10 to play. According to Parnell, $50 is enough to give a child in a less-developed country a Right to Play program for an entire year. The program teaches the children about the dangers of disease and in-fection to help keep them safe while also introducing them to sport. Co-president of Right to Play Laurier Jeff Nelson, was instrumen-tal in organizing the event. He was extremely proud of the effort his volunteers put forth in reaching their goal.“Everyone was all in in terms of organizing it,” he said. “We were telling everyone on cam-pus through social media to come out, and even during the event we had people on campus telling people to come out. That just shows that the Laurier community is all about this kind of stuff which is great.”Laurier students managed to break the record after several games. Parnell and Right to Play founder and CEO Johann Koss, as well as members of the media participated in order to help reach 100 players. Nelson said everyone involved was thrilled to be a part of a fun event, but he emphasized that it was especially exciting for everyone to  be a part of a Guinness World Record.  “It was unbelievable,” Nelson said. “Because to be part of a world record in anything is something so cool, but the fact that it was sup-ported and hosted by Right to Play Laurier students who were organiz-ing it, just makes it that much better.” While this was a big occasion for Right to Play Laurier, they are looking forward to the upcoming events that they are planning for the rest of the year. “We have a lot of stuff [planned],” said Nelson. “We have a soccer tournament we want to plan, a flag football tourna-ment, a dodgeball tournament, a yoga rave and we are also in talks for other events that I’ll keep under wraps for now.”Nelson was grateful to everyone who helped support Right to Play on Wednesday. “We had everyone from all ages and groups come out. It was awe-some,” he said.

OCTOBER 8, 2014Hawks stumble into playo\u000e s\u001f e Wilfrid Laurier University women’s rugby team came up short in securing home \u0004 eld advantage coming into the playo\u0003 s.In a matchup that pitted the girls against cross-town rivals, the Water-loo Warriors, the Hawks played hard but fell to 31-7 to end the season with a record of 2-3.\u001f ey played a strong \u0004 rst half, earning a try by second-year Natalie Snyder and a conversion by fourth-year Jennifer Gilmour to take an early 7-0 lead in the \u0004 rst 15 minutes of play. \u001f at was all the o\u0003 ence the Hawks could muster, as the Warriors took control of the game. With late pressure coming in at the end of the half, the Warriors took the lead with two runs by Lauren Mueller. \u001f e Warriors were up 12-7 by halftime — two quick tries at the beginning of the second half secured their lead. After that, the Hawks couldn’t keep up. Waterloo would put one more try on the board from a failed kick that did not manage to clear the Laurier zone to end the game with 31 points. Head coach Michelle Joslin was happy with the way the Hawks played during the game. “\u001f ey came out really hard in the \u0004 rst 15 minutes of the game. We had possession for most of it. We de\u0004 nitely put points on the board \u0004 rst, I think we came really hard and played really well,” she said.Joslin thought the team played well and showed a strong e\u0003 ort against the Warriors. She noted that although the Hawks played well, they were unable to maintain their drive for the full 80 minutes of play, even though they were able to strike \u0004 rst and take the early lead. After a rough \u0004 nish to the season, Joslin wants the team to take away the positives from the game, going forward into the playo\u0003 s.\u001f e club is set to play Guelph, who they lost 48-0 to earlier in the year. According to Joslin, playing against a familiar opponent in Guelph along with a vast improvement from the Hawks throughout the season will be critical to their success in the playo\u0003 s.Going into next week, Joslin is looking for the Hawks to step up and be able to go back to basics, if they are looking to make a deep run into the playo\u0003 s.“On a day like today where the wind was pretty crazy, it doesn’t matter how many wide back plays you can do, you need to do the basics well and get possession,” she said.\u001f e Hawks will play their quar-ter\u0004 nal game against the Guelph Gryphons on Oct. 10 at 5 p.m. Guiltinan dra\u0015 ed to NLLEric Guiltinan is headed for the next stage in his athletic career.\u001f e Golden Hawks running back has forged a role on the football \u0004 eld, but his future seems to lie in the world of professional lacrosse.On Sept. 16, Guiltinan was selected 29th overall in the National Lacrosse League draft by the Minnesota Swarm. It was a moment he wasn’t sure he’d get to experience. “I didn’t even know if I was going to get drafted at all in the \u0004 rst place,” he said.His road to the draft began when he started youth lacrosse. But that was far from his only interest.“I’ve been playing lacrosse since I was six years old. I play every sum-mer … I played hockey until near the end of high school and I started football in grade nine,” he explained.\u001f is mix of sports was helpful to Guiltinan’s development, especially the combination of football and la-crosse, two sports he believes he has a similar role in.“\u001f ey’re pretty similar because I’m a running back,” he said. “What I do in lacrosse is I run with the ball for a lot of the game, so they’re both really similar in the fact that you have to run a lot, and you have to be ready to avoid contact and hit people.”Guiltinan’s draft experience was comfortable; with a few close friends from his Kitchener-Waterloo Braves lacrosse team, he sat back and hoped to hear his name called.Although apprehensive about not being selected, much of Guiltinan’s surprise upon his selection stemmed from the team that chose him. \u001f is was because he had not com-municated with Minnesota before the draft, he explained.“I didn’t really interact with them before the draft like I interacted with the other teams. So I guess I was pretty surprised, but then obviously I was really excited when I heard my name called,” he said.While teams Guiltinan had talked to included Calgary and Vancouver, Minnesota was eventually the team that decided he was worth a shot.When he joins the Swarm for training camp in early December, Guiltinan will have to exercise his hard-working nature in order to \u0004 nd a role on a youthful, talented team. \u001f is is a challenge he is well aware of.“\u001f ey’re a really young team, and they didn’t do so well last year. But I know they have pretty high expecta-tions this year because they are so young, and last year was kind of a learning experience,” he said.“Getting drafted is pretty cool, but at the end of the day I still have to make the team in order to play for them.”While he is obviously excited for the chapter he is about to embark on, Guiltinan has not forgotten about his current focus: Wilfrid Laurier Univer-sity men’s football season. As Laurier’s 4-1 squad rolls ever closer to a possible playo\u0003  berth, Guiltinan talked about the progress his team has made and his eagerness to help further their success.“\u001f e last couple of years … we haven’t had a lot of success, but this year has gone really well so far. \u001f is is de\u0004 nitely the best team I’ve been on. It’s been awesome, I’m really excited to see how this year goes.”JESSICA DIK/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHERRunning back, Eric Guiltinan was dra  ed 29th overall by the Minnesota Swarm of the National Lacrosse League. DREW YATESSTAFF WRITERWILL PROWSECORD SPORTSRUGBYLACROSSE20   •   sports   WEDNESDAY, octobEr 8, 2014Hawks back in top 10 after three years footballBeginning the season on a positive noteMichael Faulds will be returning to a very familiar field when the Wilfrid Laurier men’s football squad takes on the Western Mustangs this Thursday. The former Western quarterback standout and current football head coach will return to the TD Water-house Stadium for the first time since taking over the helm of the Golden Hawks last season. He’ll do it with a squad that has cracked the Canadian Interuniversity Sport top 10 for the first time since 2011.“I think I’ll have a little bit more excitement,” Faulds said Saturday after the Hawks defeated the York Lions 27-10. “I’m an excitable guy, but I think going down there will be even more exciting for me and I’m excited to get our guys ready to go down there.” The York victory was their fourth of the season, putting them in a four-way tie for second place in the Ontario University Athletics confer-ence. Among them sits the Windsor Lancers, the Guelph Gryphons and the Mustangs, who dropped a dra-matic 32-29 decision to the unde-feated McMaster Marauders. “Our guys are ready,” Faulds said. “I told the guys, ‘You’re not always going to win pretty, sometimes you have to win ugly.’ It’s nice as a coach to know we can win several different ways.”On Saturday afternoon, Laurier certainly had their ugliest win of the season and had their toughest game since the Lancers matchup in week two. The Hawks were unable to gener-ate substantial offence and quar-terback James Fracas threw his first interception of the season.A tight defence allowed Lau-rier to escape giving up their first touchdown since the game-winning touchdown against Windsor on Sept. 6, and a breakout fourth quarter put the game out of reach. “The game was still up in the air at the start of the fourth and we put together a couple solid drives in the fourth, and defence played lights out. We weren’t doing much for offence for those first three quarters, but the defence kept us in the game,” Faulds said.In Saturday’s win, running back Dillon Campbell once again made his mark, as he became the fifth play-er in Laurier history to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in a single season. He finished the day with 171 yards, total-ing 1,071 yards on the season.“It’s unbelievable when you think it’s only been five games,” Faulds said. “What he’s doing — and I know he’s going to give all of the credit to the offensive line — but I’ll stand here and give him credit. He’s an unbelievable running back [and] he works extremely hard.”Five games into the season, Campbell sits 544 yards ahead of the next closest running back in the OUA and an outstanding 368 yards ahead of the second-place leader in the country. But the fourth-year is look-ing farther than the milestone. “Honestly, I’m just thinking for-ward to Western,” he said. “It’s great to get over 1,000, but to get this win, it [was] a tough win and we faced adversity, but we overcame it to take over the Lions.” With a short week to prepare to take on the defending Vanier Cup champions, Laurier will have to mend the mistakes made against the 0-6 Lions. They’ll also be looking to prove something after being one of the only teams that held Western to less than 50 points last season — dropping a 45-24 decision. Campbell also scored a 100-yard touchdown against the Mustangs’ defence. “I’m excited. The four years I’ve been here, Western’s always been my favourite team to play, just because they always give us a real serious task every time. I like to get challenged, so it’s going to be a good battle,” said fourth-year defensive lineman Ese Mrabure-Ajufo, who finished Saturday’s game with 5.5 tackles and 2.5 sacks for 18 yards. “I’ve got my eye on [quarterback Will] Finch, their running back, their o-line, their receivers. Everyone.”Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. on Thurs-day in London. hockeyThe Wilfrid Laurier University wom-en’s hockey team had their hands full last weekend. Facing off against two very physi-cal teams, the Nipissing Lakers and Laurentian Voyageurs, the Hawks were able to come away with two wins, starting their season record off on a good note — but it wasn’t easy.The Lakers and Voyageurs, who entered the Ontario University Ath-letics division last year, proved to be a force to be reckoned with facing off against the Hawks. Laurier won a close matchup against the Lakers on Oct. 2 in a 3-2 shootout victory, with second-year winger Dollee Meigs scoring the only goal for the Hawks during the shootout.“It’s great. Feels good, it was a good start to the year,” Meigs said, re-ferring to her goal against the Lakers. Meigs goal is to play a bigger role on the team, both in terms of offence and defence and  to contribute to the team as much as she can.  Goaltender Amanda Smith remained solid, earning her second overtime victory in her career. She stopped 18 shots during regu-lation and overtime and turned away all three Laker shooters to capture the win. “[Smith’s] play was solid in game one,” head coach Rick Osborne said. “She struggled during the preseason because she’s not anywhere near in shape just yet.”Osborne is anxious to see Smith in the second half of the season, when she regains her form and condition-ing. According to him, Smith’s lateral movement and her conditioning needs to be improved for her to return to the form she was during last season.On Oct. 5, the Hawks hosted the Voyageurs in what would surely be a physical game for both teams, in which the Hawks won 4-0. After a strong first period that saw the Hawks score three goals in the first 10 minutes of the game, they remained disciplined and gained momentum coming into the rest of the game.That was when the contact started. “It was chippy,” Osborne said about his thoughts on the game against Laurentian.  “I was proud of the way our team kept their hands and their sticks down and skated today. You could see that in the first period by the penalties we drew.”The only way for the Hawks to slow the Voyageurs advances was to meet their physical play. Near the end of the game, a Laurentian player drilled center Megan Howe, which saw the Voyageur get a five-minute penalty and a game misconduct. “I believe our power play is going to be a determinant in that as the season goes on,” Osborne said. “We’ll continue to enjoy having power plays.”Rookie goalie Nicholle Kovach got the start in net, shutting the door and turning away 12 shots to earn the shutout victory in her first game in season play. Having two strong goaltenders and four lines that can contribute is the key to Osborne’s success in his formula to return to the OUA cham-pionships this year. The Hawks go on the road next weekend, facing off against the Lanc-ers and the Mustangs. Puck drops on Oct. 11 at 7:30 p.m. at Windsor Arena against the Lancers.
