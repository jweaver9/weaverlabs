Situated in a socially and politically conservative state, the University of North Dakota provides an understanding of how LGBTQ+ students organized in the 1980s out of necessity to combat social opposition and discriminatory state legislation. LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support services and resources as there is no historical evidence of the university administration taking steps to improve the campus environment for LGBTQ+ students prior to the development of programs and services in 2017. This study contributes to the historical study of LGBTQ+ people by centering on LGBTQ+ student activism in higher education. Grounded in critical historical inquiry, oral history interviews, and primary source evidence aids in telling a more complete story of queer history at the University and connecting it to the current affairs and status on the institutional commitment to LGBTQ+ students, faculty, and staff. It also uses queer theory as a theoretical framework to guide and understanding of LGBTQ+ student experiences and the oppression they faced that lead to queer resistance. This study argues how LGBTQ+ student advocacy and activism was the driving force for the University of North Dakota, the flagship university in the state, to become a cultural battleground in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality.  Keywords: queer history, student activism, higher education  1  CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION  Adjacent to the University of North Dakota’s (UND) campus, a group of gay male students gathered at the local Methodist church to share stories and find a sense of belonging. There were no posters, newspaper articles, or any form of communication other than word-of-mouth in finding the group. The secrecy, the hiding, and the invisible presence of LGBTQ+ students on campus was the norm for a time when social opposition was at an all-time high under a politically conservative government administration and at the start of the AIDS epidemic. LGBTQ+ students could not organize in spaces such as the Memorial Union as there was no registered student organization for LGBTQ+ students to reserve a space and many were not ready to risk outing themselves in such a manner to gather in a public building.   It was not uncommon for LGBTQ+ students in the early 1980s at UND to find community through underground networks or secret gatherings. One narrative shares the story of how a group of gay men would meet at the Women’s Center on Hamlin Street, but they would use the back door because it was men entering a women’s space and also to hide their identity. The group that met at the Methodist church adjacent to campus found support from the minister who was characterized as being “progressive” for his time. In 1981, a group of LGBTQ+ students came together to form the UND Gay Community and gained official University recognition in 1982 as the first LGBTQ+ student organization at UND and in the state of North Dakota. The students wanted to change the narrative on campus concerning the acceptance of 2  LGBTQ+ students; this was the beginning of LGBTQ+ student organization, activism, and the fight for equal rights at UND.   After decades of advocacy work by the students at the UND for a university-funded LGBTQ+ center, the Pride Center was established on campus in 2017 with a full-time staff member whose primary responsibilities were towards supporting LGBTQ+ students. The creation of the Pride Center was a historical victory for the students. With its development, UND became the first higher education institution in the State to have a physical space on campus specifically for LGBTQ+ students with a full-time staff member designated to support them was no small victory; the path to success was met with decades of setbacks, yet the students were resilient amidst a wave of state-wide anti-LGBTQ+ bills and ultimately defeated inclusive bills, budget cuts, and social opposition.  Queer historian, John D’Emilio (2002) expresses “history as it is written, after all, is rarely the story of everything that happens but, instead, a narrative of what is salient, what marks a period in some special way” (p. 24). The formation of the UND Gay Community at UND is just that, a piece of history that is known, but a story that is not fully told or understood. This dissertation focuses specifically on LGBTQ+ student activism starting in the early 1980s that led to institutional action against a backdrop of political and social opposition in a conservative state.  For historical context, the UND was founded in 1883, before North Dakota was a state and was constructed on the ancestral lands of the Pembina and Red Lake Bands of Ojibwe and Dakota Oyate. The University and State, like many across the nation, have a history of tension between Indigenous people and their land, a narrative that reiterates the ongoing politically conservative perspectives, ideologies, and practices towards historically marginalized 3  people. North Dakota has a long-standing conservative history that is not conducive or accepting of diverse people.  Anti-LGBTQ legislation dates as early as 1917 in State v. Nelson, where sodomy laws were broadened from prior codes that existed during the then, Dakota Territory. Sodomy laws applied to all people regardless of their sexual orientation, but were written in a way to target gay people. In 1981, a child custody decision was made against a parent, Sandra Jacobson in Jacobson v. Jacobson because she admitted to having a same-sex relationship with another person, and it then was used against her in court. By 2009, North Dakota legislature failed to pass Senate Bill 2278 which would have protected LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. A similar bill, Senate Bill 2252, had failed in 2013 and again in 2017 with House Bill 1386.  Additional attempts to pass inclusive legislation failed with Senate Bill 2303 which would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation in 2019. Additionally, in 2021, House Bill 1298 passed and banned transgender students from participating on school sports teams. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Doug Burgum. The same year, Burgum signed House Bill 1503 that would allow student groups at colleges, universities, and high schools to discriminate against LGBTQ+ students based on free speech and the right of faith-based student organizations; however, many universities in the State have policies in place that prohibit discrimination as they receive federal financial support. The legislative history demonstrates the ongoing political and social opposition that is experienced by LGBTQ+ students.    This dissertation creates an understanding of how LGBTQ+ services in higher education formed as a result of student activism in a socially and politically conservative state. LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support networks, resources, 4  and structures as evidence showed minimal to no support from university administrators. The research provides a narrative of how LGBTQ+ students began to organize against opposition they experienced from the 1980s to present day; it tells a history of resilience, a rise in activism, and a story of hope for a better future. UND provides a unique understanding of how LGBTQ+ students organized and created the first LGBTQ+ rights organization in North Dakota but also engaged in campus, local, and state politics to create effective change. As a flagship university, UND provided a foundation for other universities in the State to engage in efforts to include and protect LGBTQ+ students, faculty, and staff. The efforts led by LGBTQ+ students did not just have an impact on the campus, but they shaped the future for the fight in LGBTQ+ rights across the state, adding to the regional diversity in queer historiography.  The narratives in this dissertation center on UND adding to current scholarship on LGBTQ+ activism. Scholars, such as John D’Emilio and Patrick Dilly are among a select few historians with literature on queer history during a post-Cold War era and into an age of civil rights that incorporate narratives from higher education. D’Emilio’s Making Trouble: Essays on Gay History, Politics and the University focuses on activism, organization, and their own experience forming the Gay Academic Union in urban environments such as New York City in 1973. Patrick Dilley’s Queer Man on Campus: A History of Non-Heterosexual College Men, 1945-2000 is one study that provided context to the experiences of queer men in colleges and universities that expanded beyond costal institutions where most historical studies occurred. Other scholars have written pieces in journals and chapters more specifically about LGBTQ experiences in higher education such as Brett Beemyn and Karen Graves. Beemyn explores the formation of LGBTQ+ student groups in the state of New York in “The Silence is Broken: A history of the First Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual College Student Groups.” Graves provides an 5  overview of LGBTQ+ issues from a historical perspective in “The History of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Issues in Higher Education.” Literature on early LGBTQ+ student activism and organization on college campuses tells the story from progressive points of view in locations where social support, community activism, and large urban populations existed. These stories are important to understanding a more complete queer history of higher education but lacks the narratives of those that continue to experience opposition in politically conservative regions of the United States.   Although most existing scholarship addresses studies conducted on LGBTQ+ experiences in urban and coastal regions of the nation, Patrick Dilly’s historical study of the Midwest in Gay Liberation to Campus Assimilation: Early Non-heterosexual Student Organizing at Midwestern Universities provides an understanding of LGBTQ+ life from a regional perspective. Dilly’s work is one of a few that focuses primarily on the Midwest and is limited to large public research institutions in urban environments. Beth Bailey also contributes to historical research in the Midwest with Sex in the Heartland by focusing on the story of sexual revolution in Lawrence, Kansas and at the University of Kansas. Positionality Statement I am a gay, practitioner-scholar at the UND. My practice engages with the historical context of LGBTQ+ programs and services at the emergence of best practices and institutional policies in higher education. As an openly gay employee at UND, my work focuses on supporting LGBTQ+ students and developing campus-wide initiatives specific to gender and sexuality. I engage in research to contextualize the past and advocate for a future of equitable LGBTQ+ support services and radical inclusion at UND. My dissertation is intended for several audiences. Scholars of the history of higher education will find an argument about the 6  development of LGBTQ+ student services and how they were shaped in conservative spaces. Institutional policy makers will learn about the impact of state legislation on higher education and how it impacts LGBTQ+ students faculty, and staff. Institutional administrators will find an argument concerning the role of higher education in developing support structures that demonstrate a commitment to serving LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, students will explore queer history in higher education through the lens of student activism, gain institutional context of how the UND LGBTQ+ organization formed, its involvement on campus, and future directions on how students can continue to engage in activism.   Evolving Language  Throughout this dissertation, the acronym “LGBTQ+” is utilized to capture the broader understanding of identities on the gender and sexuality spectrum. Language used to articulate shared identity experiences has evolved over time and is evident in this dissertation. For instance, “gay” is an identity term that was once used to identify men who were attracted to men, but over time, the term was used broadly to identify anyone who was not heterosexual or straight. As language shifts occurred, the broad definition of gay evolved to LGBTQ+ to demonstrate representation of those that identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer. More recently, the terms “queer” and “transgender” have been used broadly to identify people on the gender and sexuality spectrum. For the purpose of the dissertation, LGBTQ+ is used when talking about gender and sexuality broadly and where other identity terms are used situationally to provide context of language pertinent to its place in history.  Organizing a Movement Nationally, student activism in the 1960s paved the way for greater resources, support, and initiatives in higher education. Student groups that formed out of resilience did more than just 7  provide a gathering space; they were advocating for physical spaces on college campuses and for institutional resources such, as inclusive counseling (D’Emilio, 2013). One of the first LGBTQ+ student organizations in the United States was known as the Student Homophile League, founded in 1967 at Columbia University (D’Emilio, 2013; Graves, 2015). Uniquely situated in an urban environment, just miles away from the Stonewall Inn, a prominent location known as the birthplace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, and the nearby headquarters of LGBTQ+ activist groups, the Student Homophile League had community support to engage in activism in urban environments where the work was thriving in the 1960s through the 1970s, from protests against the war in Vietnam, the assassinations of Malcom X and Martin Luther King, Jr., the formation of the Black Panther Party, the women’s rights movement, and Stonewall Uprising (Bronski, 2011). These events gave way for the Student Homophile League to shape their purpose, their existence, and the establishment of a physical space at Columbia University in the early 1970s. Ethnographic research on LGBTQ+ students inform us of how students organized and their experiences of changing social and political landscapes (Dilly, 2002; Renn, 2019). This tells us what occurred in student organizations, LGBTQ+ centers, and when support services started and now, how they formed in such social and political climates. By 1985, more than three hundred LGBTQ+ student groups existed across college and university campuses (D’Emilio, 2013). Students and activist groups were not just organizing to fight for their rights, but it was also a fight for survival as AIDS spread rapidly alongside the political agendas of the religious right (Lugg, 1998; Graves, 2015).  Institutions of higher education that allowed the development of LBGTQ+ student groups were considered radical, and their administrations often met opposition from students, stakeholders, anti-LGBTQ leaders, and state legislators. Resilience was needed more than ever, especially in locations where many had lost hope.   8  Shaping Student Activism in Higher Education The fight for LGBTQ+ rights through larger protests and visible national resistance ignited university students to start a movement in higher education. Scholarship on queer history in the 1960s and 1970s often focuses on early student activism and social movements that were occurring. Historians agree that the first LGBTQ+ student group started in 1967 at Columbia University, and the students called the group the Student Homophile League (Beeymn, 2003; D’Emilio, 2013; Graves, 2015). Students challenged institutions of higher education to create spaces and include LGBTQ+ students as part of everyday campus activities with institutional support without facing opposition. Beeymn (2003) writes on the history of LGBTQ student organizations, specifically at Cornell University where militant tactics of antiwar and Black Power Movements shaped LGBTQ+ student visibility and confrontational actions in advocating for social and political liberation. Early student activism was larger than advocating for space and a sense of belonging. It was providing a foundation for the gay liberation movement on college and university campuses.   In addition to developing a movement for LGBTQ+ student rights, a cultural shift in language, identity, and involvement of LGBTQ+ students in higher education was also occurring. Dilly (2002), explains how students in the late 1960s had moved away from the terms homophile and homosexuality as an identifier but were now using “gay” or “gay community.\" Homosexual was viewed as repressive and limiting, and it had a negative connotation and reinforced stereotypes; it was also a clinical term that focuses only on sexual behavior. Student activists wanted to be treated as equals in higher education and to be viewed as a class of people. Shifts in language helped create a more inclusive community where LGBTQ+ people could create unity and shape a movement. The Stonewall Riots provided an outlet for LGBTQ+ student 9  activism as they focused on equal access and funding in campus activities and organizations, advocated for inclusive intuitional policy, and demanded an end to discriminatory practices.  Many LGBTQ+ students found success in higher education as university administrators tried to recover from demonstrations, student strikes, and building occupations by Black and white student radicals (D’Emilio, 2013). Dilly (2002) found that students in the Midwest were challenged with anti-state legislation and institutional opposition. University of Kansas’s Chancellor issued a statement of opposition to recognize the Lawrence Gay Liberation Front:   Formal recognition of a proposed student organization confers only significant advantage. A recognized student group may submit requests for funds to the Student Senate. Since we are not persuaded that student activity funds should be allocated either to support or to oppose the sexual proclivities of students, particularly when they might lead to violate of state law, the University of Kansas decline to formally recognize the Lawrence Gay Liberation Front. (KU News Bureau, 1970, as cited in Dilly, 2002, p. 169)  D’Emilio (2013) found that similar institutional action was taken against many LGBTQ+ student groups that were forming and seeking institutional recognition. By 1974, more than 175 gay student groups were in existence and an estimated 300 by 1985. Although there was growth in LGBTQ+ students organizing, they continued to face social, institutional, and political opposition. Many of the student groups founded in the Midwest were built on the work of the Gay Liberation Movement at universities such as Michigan State University, University of Illinois, University of Kansas, and the University of Missouri as explored in Dilly’s work on gay liberation at Midwestern universities (2019).   Jack Baker 10  LGBTQ+ students in the 1970s were doing more than just organizing; they were seeking out student leadership roles to bring LGBTQ+ visibility and issues to the forefront of student experiences. Jack Baker, a law student, was elected as student body president at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 1971. Dilly (2002; 2019) describes Baker as one the most visible gay student politicians of the time, especially after a highly public campaign photo of Baker in a suit and high heels. Baker was a campus disrupter by creating history to influence change and challenge campus rules of acceptance of gays and lesbians (Dilly, 2019). This shift helped empower other students across the nation to be open with their sexuality while pursuing student governing body positions in higher education.   In addition to Baker’s student political pursuits, they were making history in the fight for marriage equality.  Their 1971 case Baker v Nelson, was just one of many gay marriage cases during the 1970s that had been overruled (Rimmerman, Wald, & Wilcox, 2000). Baker sued Gerald Nelson, Clerk of District Court, over the fact that the marriage license they were denied was not forbidden. Baker and Michael McConnel were able to apply for a marriage license in a different county and received it; however, the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota did not recognize the marriage although same-sex marriage was not prohibited at this time.  Baker’s story is one that many historians have written about but is the only of its kind that exists in the northern plains. The University of Minnesota is a large collegiate system and the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities is situated in an urban development with access to community resources, organizations, and in a location that has a history of LGBTQ+ activism. Gay Dances: The Fight for Space and Community A significant piece in queer scholarship in higher education focuses on is gay dances. In the 1970s and 1980s, gay dances were increasingly popular on college campuses as they 11  provided opportunities for socialization and expression (Dilly, 2002). Hosting a dance often met opposition from university administrators and there were also factors of cost at play to utilize a space because many LGBTQ+ student organizations were not officially recognized. In 1970, students at New York University occupied a university building for a week to get administrators to approve a gay dance (D’Emilio, 2013). Students involved with the Lawarence Gay Liberation Front were met with financial barriers to host a dance as they had to rent space at the University of Kansas since the GLF was not a registered organization; the purpose of the dances by GLF were to help cover the costs and help fund lawsuits against the University (Dilly, 2002).   Dancing brought the community together and could be viewed as a radical act at the height of the Gay Liberation Movement. The Chicago Gay Liberation was fortunate to have members that were students at the University of Chicago which had access to campus buildings to host a dance (D’Emilio, 2014). There was fear to hold a same-sex dance on a college campus but also a sense of safety as campus politics and values were shifting. In larger cities, the narrative for acceptance, support for activism, and social acceptance was growing unlike that in many smaller communities that continued to experience opposition.  The Rise of Conservative Politics The Stonewall Riots was the catalyst for the Gay Liberation Movement. On June 28, 1970, one year after the riots, LGBTQ+ people joined by the thousands for the Christopher Street Liberation Day March (Eaklore, 2008), and the march later evolved into what we call today “Pride.” However, it was so much more. It was an action-oriented movement that sought to fight for equal rights and bring national attention to LGBTQ+ existence. As the LGBTQ+ community became more visible by bringing national attention to inequities, new challenges were arising in a post-Stonewall movement.  12  The Right to Organize    The 1970s brought on political and institutional battles in higher education. Students were organizing Student Homophile Leagues similar to that of Columbia University and also developing chapters of the Gay Liberation Front (Dilley, 2002). D’Emilio (2013) writes how student groups developed with these social movements; they fought for their rights to organize, be recognized, and to be funded all while experiencing ostracism and harassment. A growing number of LGBTQ+ student groups on college campuses began to cause concern for state legislators and administrators in higher education. D’Emilio expressed that many administrators on college campuses opposed the formation of gay student groups as they felt the groups would encourage activity that would violate the law. Cases taken to court often sustained the right for students to organize under the First Amendment but only for that reason. The courts held no sympathy for the students nor provided evidence of support to what was referred to as homosexual behavior. This was only the beginning of enacting positive change in higher education; social opposition was further developing with anti-LGBTQ+ activism rising across the nation.  Dilly (2019) describes how tension continued in the fight for recognition between LGBTQ+ students and the University of Missouri (Mizzou) throughout the 1970s. Denials of recognition of the Gay Liberation Front at Mizzou by administration and the system board members enacted involvement from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in filing a suit with the U.S. District Court against the University. A back-and-forth approval and denial process began between the courts, the students and ACLU, and the University. Any decision favoring LGBTQ+ student organizing was denied by the University despite an injunction by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978. The University of Missouri Gay Liberation March took place on April 13  20, 1978 by demanding recognition, but the students were met with resistance from protestors that threw objects at the LGBTQ+ students and heckled them as they marched. Although students had the right to organize, campus resistance remained a story not too uncommon to many students in the Midwest.   Anita Bryant  As the LGBTQ+ community presence grew, the motivation and energy after Stonewall was slowly fading with the rise of conservative politics across the nation. Aggressive opposition of the LGBTQ+ movement gave way to anti-activists such as pop singer Anita Bryant, a name that frequents queer history. In 1977, Bryant led a crusade against pro-LGBTQ+ legislation with her “Save our Children” campaign (Wolf, 2009; Rimmerman, Wald, & Wilcox, 2000; D’Emilio, 2013). Bryant’s campaign supported religious right-wing conservatives and her tactics were proven successful with a win in Dade County, Florida by overturning an ordinance that protected LGBTQ+ people. Gaining national attention, Bryant took her campaign across the nation and had success in in rescinding similar local laws in Eugene, Oregon; Wichita, Kansas; and into the northern plains at St. Paul, Minnesota (Rimmerman, Wald, & Wilxoc, 2000). The end of the 1970s closed a chapter on activism born out of the 1960s leading a cultural shift of conservative politics, emergence of the Christian right, and the AIDS epidemic.  The AIDS Epidemic  Historians express how AIDS was more than just a disease devastating the LGBTQ+ community as it highlighted systemic discrimination of the LGBTQ+ community that plagued the nation. Early detections of HIV and AIDS were found spreading among gay men at alarming rates which created the stigma that all gay men have the illness. This led to the development of legislation that discriminated against people with AIDS, an attack on the LGBTQ+ community 14  with no intentions to solve the epidemic (Bronski, 2011). LGBTQ+ communities had little to no support from governing bodies to address the nation’s issues concerning AIDS. Grass-roots local activism began to spread rapidly, but unfortunately the Regan Administration limited expansion beyond urban development where conservatism and religious fundamentalism was thriving (D’Emilio, 2013). Activist groups such as The Gay Men’s Health Crisis, ACT UP, AIDS Action Council, and the Human Rights Campaign grew out of a political resistance movement with a focus on AIDS policies and access to new drugs for people with AIDS (Rimmerman, Wald & Wilcox, 2000).   The AIDS epidemic reignited activism work with a return to aggressive strategies similar to that of the early 1970s. LGBTQ+ people were better organized, had larger developed organizations, and a wider reach than previous generations. By 1987, activists organized the March on Washington to demand a national response to AIDS and LGBTQ+ rights. The Second National March on Washington was larger and more strategic than the first with a display of the Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and a wedding ceremony with protest to address anti-LGBTQ+ legislation (D’Emilio, 2013). Political protests continued and started to focus more on city and state policies relating to AIDS, safe-sex education, sexuality, and reproductive rights. On December 12, 1989, members of ACT UP and protestors demonstrated in front of New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral, known as the “Stop the Church Protest”, and entered the cathedral, lay down and protested the influence that the archdiocese and Cardinal John O’Connor had on anti-LGBTQ+, anti-safe sex, and reproductive rights policy (Bronski, 2011). Radical acts of protest such as the ‘Stop the Church Protest” caught national attention and influenced election campaigns into the 1990s with a shift into democratic politics under the Clinton Administration.  LGBTQ+ Student Support in Higher Education 15  Institutions of higher education have a complex history of showing support for LGBTQ+ students, initiatives, and programs. Historians such as Karen Graves, John D’Emilio, and Patrick Dilly are among the few that have collected narratives and understanding of LGBTQ+ history in higher education. Groundbreaking work in LGBTQ+ higher education history is credited to John D’Emilio’s Making Trouble: Essays on Gay History, Politics, and the University followed by Patrick Dilly, ten years later with Queer man on Campus: A History of Non-heterosexual College Men, 1945-2000 (Graves, 2012). D’Emilio (2013) draws on personal experience as a pioneer in queer history with a focus on the rise of activism in the 1960s and 1970s along with the emergence of queer studies and scholarship. Dilly (2002) applies queer theory to the experiences of sexual identity development among gay college men and expands the work of D’Emilio from the 1980s to the 2000s. These works contribute to our understanding of LGBTQ+ experiences in higher education and how students were disrupters of history, but scholarship is limited by regional location and a diverse demographic as research primarily focused on gay men. Studies conducted in the Midwest often focus on institutions located in urban developments and in states that have had a mix of conservative and progressive politics. LGBTQ+ Exclusion  Colleges and universities had varying stances on whether or not LGBTQ+ students would be accepted. Early accounts of exclusion are evident in experiences by students enrolled in college during the 1950s. According to Dilly (2002), students in the 1950s were subject to dismissal from the college if they were found responsible for homosexual conduct. LGBTQ+ students had to hide their identity or fear being outed to campus administrators; even being associated with someone who was identified as LGBTQ+ was risky as you would most likely be 16  investigated too for being LGBTQ+. Dilly writes on one subject’s experiences interviewed for their study who attended the University of Illinois in the early 1950s:  One of the professors told me, you have to be very careful. He even had his telephone disconnected because they were investigating everybody, and they said the college at the time had a quota system. The college could have no more than five percent Jewish students, no more than two percent Blacks, and zero tolerance for gays. (Dilly 2002, p. 59) The fear was more than just a perception. It was a reality for many students, faculty, and staff as they were removed from their positions or dismissed from the university. Dilly narrates the experiences of a student that was dismissed: Over the Christmas holidays I might have been in a gay bar that was raided, in Chicago. It was on Division Street. And I do not know whether that might have gone on my record. They [they Chicago police] asked what I was doing, and I had to admit that I was a student at the university. Without much of a hearing or a lawyer or anything, [the university] just sent me a letter. They had a regents’ meeting at the school; I was dismissed for conduct unbecoming a student. (Dilly, 2002, p. 59) There were few colleges that would accept LGBTQ+ students after they were dismissed from the institution making it challenging for students to complete their degrees and seek out gainful employment. Oftentimes, students would be allowed to complete coursework but never had their degrees conferred.   Campus exclusion of LGBTQ+ people existed well before the 1950s as college and university administrators tried to silence LGBTQ+ students by developing tactics to prevent the opportunity to gather and host campus-related activities. Graves (2018) addresses how state 17  politics and social opposition continued to impact LGBTQ+ people into the 1960s with actions from states such as Florida with the creation of the Johns Committee from 1956-1966 with the purpose of seeking out communists and LGBTQ+ people at Florida’s Universities. The impact of politics on universities only continued to grow.    Anti-legislation campaigns were on the rise to prohibit LGBTQ+ students from becoming recognized student groups and resulting in greater activism work from LGBTQ+ students. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, students at the University of Kansas participated in parades in public spaces to have visible representation of queerness on campus (Dilly, 2002). Similar events would occur in 1992 at the University of Kansas during the Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week, such as the promenades with same-gender couples holding hands while walking from the Kansas memorial Union to a rally at Wescoe Hall, the campus dining center, or the campus kiss-in where students would stand in a circle and kiss the person of the same gender to their left and then to their right outside of Wescoe Hall. LGBTQ+ students participated in these events to gain institutional attention, challenge heterosexuality, and advocate for changes in policies and acceptance.    Incidents of discrimination were evident across many college campuses throughout the 1980s to present day. D’Emilio (2013) articulates how hate-motivated acts towards lesbian and gay students were growing at alarming frequencies across the nation. Institutions, such as the University of Kansas, University of Chicago, and Pennsylvania State University, had reports of bias-motivated incidents that mostly targeted LGBTQ+ people. Social and political opposition continued to shape collegiate environments for LGBTQ+ students by increasing the need and expectation for identity support resources, policies, and interventions.  LGBTQ+ Centers and Queer Studies   18  Activism from the 1960s shifted institutional response to LGBTQ+ support. LGBTQ+ student groups were winning court cases against campus administrators that were against LGBTQ+ organizations and campus activities. Student activists challenged higher education administration, and as a response, many institutions started to develop institutional support systems. In 1971, the University of Michigan formed the first Lesbian-Gay Male Programs Office, this was the beginning for LGBTQ+ centers on college campuses (Dilly, 2002; Fine, 2012). That same year, the University of Nebraska created the first gay studies class in collegiate curriculum, and the next year, California State University, Sacramento established the first gay studies program in 1972 (Graves, 2015).   The growth in LGBTQ+ student support was on a rise in urban areas and in states with more progressive politics and social acceptance for LBGTQ+ people whereas more rural areas and conservative state institutions struggled to create support. By the late 1990s, higher education saw a reawakening in the support for LBGTQ+ students with the murder of out gay University of Wyoming student, Matthew Shepard. Shepard was beaten, tied to a barbed-wire fence, and left for dead in rural Wyoming. Shepard’s death gained national attention as one of the most violent hate crimes against an LGBTQ+ person. There was a slight increase in the development of LGBTQ+ support efforts following Shepard’s death in 1998. However, there were fewer than 150 offices or centers for LGBTQ+ student services out of the 2,000+ institutions of higher education (Fine, 2012). Further research is needed to understand what factors are at play that prohibits the development of LGBTQ+ centers and queer studies programs. Lange, Duran, and Jackson (2021) express how the creation of LGBTQ+ centers and staff positions are often developed out of activism and social opposition but are created on the basis of best practices throughout higher education. They articulate how LGBTQ+ student 19  support services and structures lack evidence-based research in their development. The research gap could be a missing link between student needs articulated through activism and effective LGBTQ+ support structures in higher education.  Contextualizing North Dakota within National Events  The Stonewall Uprising, known as one of the pivotal turning points in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights may not have had as much of an impact in North Dakota fights for LGBTQ+ rights. A panel discussion held on the fiftieth anniversary of Stonewall at North Dakota State University (NDSU) included narratives from individuals who recalled the event in 1969. Panelist Cindy Phillips, a graduate student at NDSU in 1969 shared their perspective about the event: I did not know about it. I do not think most people here [North Dakota] knew about it and even people who knew about it might not have realized that it became the turning point it did in history. (Norowzi, 2019)   News about national events in the fight for LBGTQ+ rights did not widely spread throughout North Dakota, but had some impact on state legislation. The Stonewall Uprising influenced states, including North Dakota to overturn sodomy laws that were often targeted towards gay men although they applied to everyone. It would not be until the 1980s when LGBTQ+ people in the state would truly begin to organize and engage in activism when the AIDS epidemic became a greater concern for North Dakota citizens.  At one of the lowest points in queer history, LGBTQ+ students at UND took a risk by becoming visible and forming an organization when all the odds were against them in the 1982. Although conversations regarding HIV and AIDS had not yet fully impacted North Dakota, the rhetoric of AIDS being a “gay issue” influenced social opposition of LGBTQ+ people across the state. The formation of the UND Gay community in 1982 would help with spreading awareness 20  and education about AIDS. Opportunities for awareness-based education in the early 1990s made AIDS a reality in the state. The Names Project AIDS Quilt, a national quilt created to honor the lives of those who had died by AIDS, traveled around universities and even had an appearance at the UND, once in 1993-94 and again in 2000 (Leppo, Hirning, Larson, Trimarco, & Solberg, 2008).    This dissertation explores how North Dakota began to engage with the national social and political landscape through the activism of the UND Gay Community, the student organization that formed at UND in 1982. Institutions of higher education often became agents of social change in their states as they fostered student growth and activism, challenged policy, and demonstrated their commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ people. UND is uniquely situated in scholarship as an institution that is deeply intertwined with a history of conservative state politics. As a flagship institution, UND often sets the narrative for the future in research, academics, and innovative practices. However, compared to national advances in supporting LGBTQ+ students UND met challenges as support services and physical spaces were not developed until 2017. This was almost two decades after the death of Matthew Shepard, a horrific incident that became the catalyst for higher education to shift its practice in supporting LGBTQ+ students. This dissertation aims to shape a more complete history of LGBTQ+ activism in North Dakota to guide institutional practice and influence policy.  Central Questions  First, what influenced LGBTQ+ students to formally organize and create the UND Gay Community? The 1980s witnessed the rise of conservative politics along with the AIDS epidemic, yet LGBTQ+ students organized an official student group on campus despite social opposition. What did the students experience in the early formation of these groups? Prior to 21  organizing, LGBTQ+ students met in secret, and this was the first time they had a visible, organized presence at the University.   Second, what role did the UND have in supporting LGBTQ+ visibility and activism on campus? During the late 1970s and early 1980s, LGBTQ+ student groups fought opposing state legislation by organizing on colleges and universities. How did the University respond to the formation of the UND Gay Community? How did the campus community react to the creation of the UND Gay Community?   Third, students were advocating for their rights, presence, and resources on campuses across the nation. What were LGBTQ+ students at the University fighting for? What strategies or tactics did they find to be successful? What barriers did the students overcome? What were the outcomes of their work? What impact did LGBTQ+ student activism have on the UND’s campus?  Theoretical Framework and Methodology  This dissertation seeks to contribute to the historical study of LGBTQ+ students in higher education. Existing studies focus on the narratives of student experiences at large institutions located in urban developments where LGBTQ+ activism has shaped more progressive policies, legislation, and support resources. This work expands on existing research conducted at universities in the Midwest and focuses more directly on the impact of continual social and political opposition in a historically conservative state.   Historical perspectives in research help us understand not just what occurred but positions issues and problems relevant to our own experiences within the broader context of space and time. Horsford and D’Amico (2015) explain the disruptive power of “doing history” They articulate how historical methodology includes three elements: the analysis of rich primary 22  source materials, analysis of context, and that historical scholarship pivots on analysis. First, this dissertation utilizes primary source evidence to understand how the UND Gay Community began and how LGBTQ+ activism influenced institutional change in supporting LGBTQ+ students. Legislative documents, newspaper articles, and student papers and reports along with oral histories begin to tell the narrative and provide an understanding of LGBTQ+ activism, student experiences, and sociopolitical climate.   By analyzing the context, this situates how the formation of the UND Gay Community and LGBTQ+ activism existed amidst social opposition, conservative politics, the AIDS epidemic, and social movements. The analysis takes into account the primary source evidence and interconnects them to formulate a story which makes meaning of these experiences that connect with contemporary issues. Lastly, historical scholarship pivots on analysis by approaching how facts came to be and what they mean. Scholarship agrees that the first LGBTQ+ student organization started at Columbia University and the first LGBTQ+ support center in higher education at the University of Michigan. Understanding how they formed and in what context are important. Was it a result of social movements or events such as the Stonewall Uprising? Or was it based on institutional environments that were exclusive to LGBTQ+ students? Historical analysis allows for researchers to make sense of their work and place it within the larger contexts of history in relation to the works of other historians (Horsford & D’Amico, 2015).   Theoretical Framework  Queer theory in historical research provides us with a critical lens to critique cultural and political systems that suppress individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation. Queer theory, a term coined by Teresa de Lauretis, is used as a way to define a form of resistance to cultural 23  homogenization and challenges dominant culture (de Lauretis, 1991). De Lauretis’ work in feminist cultural studies led to the coining of the term queer theory, but the origins also had influence from critical and cultural contexts, such as feminism, radicalism from racial and LGBTQ+ movements, AIDS activism in the 1980s and early 1990s, and post-structuralist theory. Prior to the coining of the term queer theory, Michel Foucault wrote on power dynamics that make sexuality a “hidden truth” that needs to be exposed (Spargo, 1999). This study uses Foucault’s notion to examine resistance as a social act from a socio-historical lens. Queer theorist, such as Gayle Rubin with the essay “Thinking Sex” and Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble and Undoing Gender, expanded on Foucault’s work and focused on social behaviors as forms of resistance.  Queer theory emerged as a field of study in the late 1980s and early 1990s alongside LGBTQ+ activism. Erin Rand (2014) expresses how queer theory’s institutionalization in American academia placed emphasis on resistance and queer activism that grew out of social movements. Perspectives of queer theory can effectively be used in historical analysis. Graves (2012) explains a myriad of justifications for how queer theory benefits historical research but one important piece is that the theory guides us into focusing on resistance, not just oppression. This is critical for understanding how student activism persisted when students were met with social opposition from the University, their peers, and legislators. Wozolek (2019) explains how queer theory is a tool that is used to reconsider sociopolitical, historical, and cultural norms and values.   Graves (2018) highlights how research on LGBTQ+ populations often mirrors social movements throughout history. This dissertation explores queer history from the 1980s through the present day. LGBTQ+ students’ experiences were not just shaped by the perceptions of 24  faculty, staff, and students but as a result of social movements throughout the decades. Queer theory also allows us to critically analyze the importance of queer spaces, movements and activism by placing it when and how it occurred. This provides us with an understanding of oppression faced by LGBTQ+ students on college campuses and in society. The formation of the UND Gay Community as an official student organization challenged heteronormativity yet created complexities. First, joining a queer student organization or entering a queer space meant navigating a level of “outness.” Queer spaces provided an opportunity for students to be authentic and true to themselves yet, outside of that space, students may have closed off aspects of their identity for safety and security. Clawson (2014) explains that queer theory aids in making meaning of identity and community to fill gaps when individuals are not out, and it also explains why the concept of space is so important as a student’s decision to out themselves impacts their identity, their sense of belonging, and their negotiation of space. The challenge that Clawson identifies is that people may feel fully understood or be their authentic selves only in queer spaces. This creates a barrier for historical research as queer spaces are difficult to observe and there may not be a record to trace. Queer theory explains the challenges with historical research on LGBTQ+ identities and offers guidance in understanding the impact of heterodominance and why limitations exist.   Queer theory is a foundation for understanding the lived experiences of queer people. As a theoretical framework in historical research, queer theory allows us to critically analyze queer identity experiences in the context of social and political opposition, activism, and the origin of queer spaces at the UND. One challenge is that gaps exist in identifying LGBTQ+ people at various points in time. Queer theory helps us make meaning and place of sexual identity community involvement (Mayo, 2007) as many LGBTQ+ students may have had varying 25  degrees of “outness” and may have only been out in queer spaces. LGBTQ+ spaces at UND and the surrounding community can be difficult to research when there are no records or traces of individuals that were involved. Queer theory builds a critique in analysis to understand the impact of policies, institutional administration, campus climate, and legislation had on creating LGBTQ spaces.  Methodology  This dissertation utilizes primary source evidence in the form of institutional archival materials, local and state newspapers, state legislation, and oral histories collectively to assist in developing a queer history at the UND. Archival material at the UND’s Elwyn B. Robinson Department of Special Collections, a department within the Chester Fritz Library has a collection of articles in the student-run newspaper, The Dakota Student. Written stories from the student perspective give insight into the social attitude towards LGBTQ+ students at the University. Early articles in the newspaper articulate opposition and student response to LGBTQ+ activism on campus. These articles also assist in developing a timeline of events, formation of support resources, and key players involved in the student organization. The local newspaper, The Grand Forks Herald, also published articles in relating to the LGBTQ+ student activism work in advocating for a Pride Center, changing city ordinances, marriage equality, and other events. Additional news sources across the state such as the Fargo Inforum and Dickinson Press, provide information and a timeline on state-wide legislation and activities impacting LGBTQ+ people in North Dakota.   Archival material provides contextual knowledge but is often written in a way that is biased towards specific viewpoints or perspectives and does not always capture the full story. Oral history is the people’s experience; it provides a more in-depth understanding of an 26  individual that experienced a specific event or was part of an organization. One challenge with oral history centers on the limitations with memory, interpretation of events, and the ability for participants to recall can all impact the information gathered (Ritchie, 2015). Although the challenges with memory exist, the benefit of an oral history is that it typically focuses on the experiences of people whose lives are not generally documented (Schrag, 2021). Oral history is important to this dissertation as it presents first-hand experience of LGBTQ+ life at the University from the 1980s through present day; no other project exists where those narratives are told at the UND.   Interviews with former members of the UND Gay Community at different periods of time assists with assembling a more cohesive history of the organization and understanding of how activism work influenced change at the UND and in the state. Six oral history interviews were conducted. Participants were identified and selected based on their involvement with the organization. Janell Holter was involved in the organization in 1985 when it was called the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles. Holter served as the organization’s president and a founding member as the student group had to reconstitute. Holter provided insight into the organization’s activities and LGBTQ+ life in Grand Forks during the 1980s. Paul Traynor was also a founding member of the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles. As an undergraduate student, Traynor was not just involved in the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles but also in Greek Life and Student Government. Traynor’s interview provided a greater understanding of how other organizations and students engaged with LGBTQ+ people on campus and the impact being out had on the future careers of students. In the present day, Traynor serves as a faculty member in the UND School of Law.  27  Keith Malaterre attended UND in the early 1990s as an undergraduate student and then again in the early 2000s as a graduate student. Malaterre’s story contributed to the understanding of the ongoing discrimination and harassment that occurred at UND. Malaterre shared experiences of what it meant to hold intersecting identities in relation to his sexuality and enrollment as a member of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Band of Indians. Malaterre remained involved at UND after earning his master’s degree as an employee of the University and currently works in UND’s Student Diversity & Inclusion office. Darin Buri was also interviewed to recall his memory during his enrollment in the mid-1990s. Buri attended UND after serving in the U.S. military. Buri’s story explored how LGBTQ+ students grappled with understanding and accepting their sexuality. Buri’s identity exploration led to his involvement with the campus LGBTQ+ student organization.   Another interview with Chris Stoner, an undergraduate student at UND in the late 1990s, was actively involved in the LGBTQ+ student group. Stoner’s story contributed to understanding how LGBTQ+ students were burdened with creating their own support resources. Stoner also articulates the activism work that he engaged in along with the LGBTQ+ organization on campus. Stoner remains a strong advocate for the LGBTQ+ community in Grand Forks through his work in drag performances and theatre productions. Stoner, Buri, and Malaterre’s stories interweave throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.   The last oral history interview with Charles Vondal highlighted contemporary issues in LGBTQ+ support and inclusion at UND and across the state of North Dakota from 2014 to present day. Vondal is a Grand Forks local, undergraduate student at UND, and president of the LGBTQ+ organization. Vondal’s story expressed the challenges LGBTQ+ students faced on campus and in the Grand Forks community leading up to the development of the UND Pride 28  Center in 2017. Vondal also articulated the ongoing issues impacting LGBTQ+ people on campus and in the state which demonstrates the historical impact of conservativism and social opposition.   In addition to the oral history interviews, a personal e-mail communication was shared with me by an individual who graduated from UND in 1974 and wanted to tell their story to keep a record of history. The pseudonym, Randall, is used to identify the individual as a means to protect their identity. Randall’s story narrated early attempts to start an LGBTQ+ student group at the University in the 1970s.   Definitions and Acronyms  This dissertation utilizes language throughout the chapters that is representative of LGBTQ+ identities and experiences throughout different decades as society’s understanding of identities and terms to use evolved. The following terms and definitions clarify meanings within the context of this study.   Gay(s) - A term used as a singular identity to represent men who are attracted to men. This term was often used in a historical context to broadly represent sexual diversity before other sexual and gender identity terms became widely accepted in society.  Homosexual – A term used only in the context of narrating oral and written history to articulate sexual attraction to people of the same gender. Presently, the term is not used as it is often referred to as outdated and clinical with negative connotations.  LGBTQ+ - A term used broadly as an identity social group including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and more identities.   Queer – A contemporary term used to address the broader understanding and complexities of LGBTQ+ identities.   29  Description of Chapters This dissertation follows a chronological order with a thematic approach for addressing how institutions of higher education are battlegrounds for cultural change from the perspective of LGBTQ+ student activism. Figure 1 shows a timeline of queer history at UND and in the state of North Dakota as explored in each chapter of this dissertation. This study is organized into five chapters. Chapter I was an introduction that provided a need and purpose of the study, a review of literature, the theoretical framework, an outline of the methodology, research questions, definition of terms, and the structure of the dissertation. Chapter II centers on the 1980s with the formation of the UND Gay Community which created a foundation for understanding LGBTQ+ student activism at the University. The chapter introduces how LGBTQ+ students began to promote awareness and education as they navigated national tensions with conservative politics during the AIDS epidemic.   Chapter III articulates how students engaged in activism out of necessity as conservative politics targeted LGBTQ+ people and how social opposition grew at UND. The chapter centers on the importance of Coming Out Week celebrations and the challenges students experienced from UND’s administration demonstrating a commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion on campus. Chapter IV explores how the LGBTQ+ community engaged in state-wide activism as North Dakota failed to support LGBTQ+ people through legislation. The chapter argues how LGBTQ+ student activism led to the development of the Pride Center on campus. Finally, Chapter V connects this history to current events by providing an understanding of the type of commitment UND has for its LBGTQ+ student population. The chapter offers a discussion on the importance of the study and its contributions to historical scholarship on LGBTQ+ student activism and recommendations for practice to expand LGBTQ+ inclusion UND.  30  Figure 1 Queer History Timeline of the University of North Dakota and State of North Dakota, 1980-2022  31  CHAPTER II QUEER RESISTANCE COMES TO NORTH DAKOTA  This dissertation argues how LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support resources in lieu of a demonstrated commitment from the University of North Dakota (UND). To understand this, we explore the history of LGBTQ+ student involvement at UND beginning in the 1980s with the formation of the UND Gay Community in 1982. The first organization of LGBTQ+ students set the foundation for students to engage in activism work as they advocated for inclusive policies, support programs, and initiatives at the University. This was significant because the act of organizing in a historically conservative state sparked hope for many at a time of extreme national opposition toward LGBTQ+ people  This chapter examines the formal organization of LGBTQ+ students at UND and starts with an early attempt in the late 1960s through the official registration in the 1980s. Organizing in the 1980s created many challenges for LGBTQ+ students as they navigated the rise of conservativism alongside the AIDS epidemic. In this chapter, oral histories by Janell Holter and Paul Traynor articulate how LGBTQ+ students organized and engaged with the campus by providing education and support resources but also the challenges without the support of the University. The chapter begins with a narrative by Randall, a UND student who graduated in 1974, and tried to establish one of the first LGBTQ+ student groups at the university. Randall had e-mailed me and shared his story to keep his memory alive before it was lost. Randall’s story32  leads to a contextual history of LGBTQ+ student experiences in higher education across the nation throughout the 1970s and sets the stage for understanding why UND LGBTQ+ students were officially organized in the 1980s. After the establishment of the UND Gay Community in 1982, this chapter explores the organization’s activities and experiences of LGBTQ+ students but also the challenges that occurred and causing a need for reorganizing in 1985 with a name change. The chapter ends with articulating how the LGBTQ+ student organization’s presence on campus was a necessity for the foundation for queer resistance at the university and in the state, leading to greater activism work that occurred in the 1990s.   Contextualizing the Past In the 1970s, LGBTQ+ students across the nation engaged in community activism, and Gay Liberation Front chapters were forming at universities, such as Iowa State University, Kansas State University, University of Michigan, Ohio State University, University of Illinois, and University of Missouri (Dilly, 2019). The Gay Liberation Movement greatly influenced the formation of student chapters at colleges and universities as the tactics and radical approaches to activism were appealing to impressionable students. The movement focused on the notion of “coming out,” a political act that any LGBTQ+ individuals could take (D’Emilio, 2013). Coming out helped grow the movement as it brought greater visibility to the community, and as individuals exposed their identity, it created an investment in the movement. University students at colleges and universities in larger cities found support from the local LGBTQ+ community connected to the aforementioned institutions and could allocate resources to become better organized. At the UND, LGBTQ+ students were not ready to join an LGBTQ+ organization as there was fear of becoming a registered student group and fear of being associated with such a 33  visible group. Randall, a 1974 graduate of UND, recalled an early attempt to start an LGBTQ+ student organization during his enrollment:  In February of 1969, I was undesirably discharged from the U.S. Navy for    homosexuality. The trauma of war, being wounded, and then undesirably discharged took its toll and I was lost and bounced around a bit. By 1971 I had come out as a gay man and returned to UND. Shortly after I arrived, I met a gay man who had just been honorably discharged from the Air Force. We became good friends, and it was sometime that summer that we started an organization which had just the two of us as members, the Gay Liberation Front. We were terrified to try and become a campus organization. I remember we also ran an ad in the Grand Forks Herald. We got a few responses but none of them wanted to be identified with a gay organization. (Randall, personal communication, February 22, 2022)  However, for Randall, attempts to start a Gay Liberation Front Chapter was met with challenges as he lacked the resources and support to become an official student organization on campus; his efforts became a distant memory in the passing years.   The LGBTQ+ Civil Rights Movement, 1970s  Beyond the borders of North Dakota, queer resistance and the liberation movement pushed the nation to engage in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the 1970s. The nation bared witness to significant events throughout the 1970s and began with the Christopher Street Liberation Day March, the first gay rights march held on June 28, 1970. The march occurred one year after the Stonewall Uprising; the event is remembered as a turning point in the LGBTQ+ civil rights movement. The march created solidarity among LGBTQ+ people who showed that 34  they were not alone and demonstrated to the world that LGBTQ+ people were ready to engage in the fight for equal rights.   Although LGBTQ+ visibility was growing across the nation, efforts to combat LGBTQ+ progress had a significant impact and led to a rise in conservativism. The most notorious anti-LGBTQ+ efforts were led by Christian pop singer Anita Bryant in 1977. Bryant led a successful campaign called Save Our Children in Dade Country, Florida to combat an ordinance to protect LGBTQ+ people that had passed. Bryant’s efforts overturned the ordinance, and with that success, she took her campaign across the nation, and created the beginnings of organized opposition to LGBTQ+ rights.   Following several local efforts to overturn LGBTQ+ protections, community organizers and LGBTQ+ organizations across the nation came together as a unified front at the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights on October 14, 1979 to take a stand against national discrimination. Leaders of the march demanded U.S. President Jimmy Carter to sign a bill to stop discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Although the goals of the march were not met by U.S. Congress or Carter, the efforts provided a foundation for LGBTQ+ rights advocacy and activism.     Each national event gave attention to the existence and experiences of LGBTQ+ people. The social and political landscape was changing as LGBTQ+ rights activists challenged social norms and continued the fight for equality. These were but stories to students at the UND and tales of “big city problems” were moments of hope that seemed far from reality. North Dakota as a state was not a hub for LGBTQ+ progress and pockets of support could be found but larger efforts to combat anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric were almost nonexistent. Across the nation, local LGBTQ+ organizations advocated for change in city and at state-level politics. In North Dakota, 35  there was no evidence of LGBTQ+ organizations or efforts to create inclusive policies. North Dakota in the late 1970s and early 1980s was removed from the national political landscape in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights.   The UND Gay Community Organizes News of national events and legislation aimed to disrupt LGBTQ+ progress alongside growing opposition in North Dakota would eventually lead a small group of university students to organize and bring the fight for LGBTQ+ rights to the northern plains. In 1982, the UND Gay Community became the first registered LGBTQ+ student organization at the UND and the first LGBTQ+ rights group in the state. A Dakota Student article notes that the organization had formed in the fall of 1981 (Sands, 1982a). However, archival evidence does not indicate the steps that members had taken to become a recognized student group on campus. Formally organizing an LGBTQ+ student group in a historically conservative state in the early 1980s was significant. Prior attempts were met with fear from its members, and North Dakota did not have a history of LGBTQ+ organizing to advocate for social change. Organization records from the UND Office of Student Activities shows that the students had to be named on their officer roster. By naming themselves, students took a risk, and it required a level of vulnerability and trust that they would not be exposed by the University. The UND Gay Community was not just breaking barriers on campus, but they were making history in North Dakota.  The UND Gay Community quickly became active in bringing awareness to the campus community about LGBTQ+ student experiences, and attempted to dispel myths and provide some education. As the organization grew, they became more closely monitored than any other student group on campus. The Dakota Student, the university student-led newspaper shifted its focus to publishing articles about the UND Gay Community’s activities from organization events 36  to spending habits; other student organizations did not have the same level of attention or publicity in the newspaper. One article, in 1982 narrates how the organization had grown to more than fifty members and was awarded $104 for travel expenses by the Student Activities Committee to attend a convention in Wisconsin (Funds allocated, 1982). This was the first time the organization had asked for funding which was an important feat as many LGBTQ+ student groups across the nation had struggled with gaining official recognition as a student organization and access to student fees for funding organization activities (Cain & Hevel, 2021). A membership of fifty LBGTQ+ students in a student organization was also significant if we consider the opposition they faced. The growth of visibility would continue to keep the organization in the spotlight as their activities would be openly shared with the campus community through The Dakota Student, an experience no other organizations would share. The attention would require the UND Gay Community to remain resilient as they continued to experience opposition from the UND and Grand Forks communities.  On April 23, 1982, the organization held a panel on-campus called “Understanding the UND Gay Community” to raise awareness and understanding about LGBTQ+ people; the event was highlighted in the student newspaper, the Dakota Student (Sands 1982a). The article indicates that the panel featured the president of the UND Gay Community, Philip Levinson, in addition to John Jarmon, a Methodist minister and director of the UND Canterbury House, and Terry Lehman, the medical director of Northeast Human Services. The panel aimed to address growing concerns around LGBTQ+ wellbeing by focusing on the impact of social opposition and lack of support. Levinson, quoted in the Dakota Student, said, “many gay people internalize societal hatred” (Sands, 1982a). Lehman, a counselor, addressed how many gays faced additional problems of isolation, loneliness, and shame. The article articulates how Lehmen noted that ten 37  to fifteen percent of the people he counseled identified as gay and sought out counseling as there were no LGBTQ+ support groups in Grand Forks or across North Dakota. This attributed to the growing need for LGBTQ+ programs and services at the University and in higher education throughout the nation.  This panel was just one of many events organized by the UND Gay Community. The group would also hold dances at local hotels. Gay dances were an important part of LGBTQ+ organization history at colleges and universities across the nation, and they served as a space for equal opportunity, identity expression and exploration, and a place to create community (Dilly, 2002). In April 1982, the organization held one such dance at an off-campus venue and received positive responses from the venue staff; however, a month later, the UND Gay Community tried to schedule another dance and were denied by the same venue (Sands, 1982b). Organization president, Levinson expressed that the incident was discrimination and stated the venue manager did not want the organization “spreading its business around” (Sands, 1982b). This phrasing was used to target LGBTQ+ students by alluding to the form of opposition from the manager. The denial of using the venue was one of the first documented incidents of discrimination experienced by the UND Gay Community.  Organizing Out of Necessity The UND Gay Community would remain active with a growing membership. The organization officer roster card dated January 1, 1983, indicates a name change to the UND Gay/Lesbian Community with one hundred members (Office of Student Activities, 1983). However, this is the last record of the organization held with the Office of Student Activities about the LGBTQ+ student group. A November 2, 1984 article in The Dakota Student suggests that the organization had dissolved as the officers did not complete the paperwork and very few 38  activities had been scheduled (Pederson, 1984). Paul Traynor, an undergraduate student at UND during this time, had no recollection of the existence of an LGBTQ+ student organization. Traynor was active in fraternity life at UND and served as president of the Interfraternity Council in 1984, the same year he had come out. Traynor was careful with whom he disclosed his identity given his involvement with Greek life. Traynor states, “there were two things that would destroy your fraternity, drugs and homosexuality” (P. Traynor, personal communication, December 9, 2021). It was difficult finding an LGBTQ+ community, especially in the Greek community. Traynor explained how gay fraternity brothers would discover one other but kept each other’s identity a secret as there was fear of what exposure could do to the fraternity. There was loyalty to the fraternity community at the expense of finding support from peers that shared similar identities and experiences. Although Traynor had found a community within his fraternity, he did not have a space to be his authentic self.   Finding a queer community was a challenging in North Dakota. One had to have personal connections which often meant taking a risk and outing yourself to someone you hoped also identified as LGBTQ+. In 1984, an opportunity for community was created in Fargo, ND almost eighty miles south of the UND, where gay-rights activist Lenny Tweeden pressured the Fargo mayor Jon Lindgren to sign a decree to recognize the city’s first gay pride celebration (Kerzman, 2015). Lindgren was referred to as a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights in North Dakota and signing the proclamation was not a concern for the mayor, and in June 1984, Lindgren signed the proclamation. The InForum, the local newspaper in Fargo reported that the recognition of the week was met with a steady stream of callers voicing their protest to Fargo City Hall for signing such a proclamation. Despite opposition from city council and Fargo citizens, pride celebrations continued with support from Lindgren. Pride events across the nation helped connect queer 39  people by allowing them to share experiences, find support, and promote greater visibility. The first pride celebration in North Dakota was an act of resistance, and it threatened the social norm of the city and set the stage for greater visibility and activism work in the state. The pride event created solidarity among LGBTQ+ people. A large visible presence demonstrated strength in numbers and made it harder for oppressors to target individuals. A growing visible population also meant greater resistance to discriminatory policies and legislation, and this created fear among oppressors as it could lead to a loss of power and control which is what happened with the Fargo Pride celebration. Those that opposed the LGBTQ+ community lost their power to control when Lindgren demonstrated support and went against the decision to prevent the Pride celebration from occurring.  In Grand Forks, finding community meant knowing the right people. Janell Holter, a nontraditional undergraduate student at UND, meaning she started her undergraduate studies later in life than most students, was active in a fairly large lesbian community in Grand Forks. Holter states, “there was a pretty active group of lesbians in Grand Forks, about twenty-five to thirty women, we would have lots of gatherings and parties” (J. Holter, personal communication, February 26, 2022). To get involved, one had to be invited or have a social connection with a member of the group. Many of the women in this group were involved in advocacy work for the 1981 Equal Rights Amendment and active in the National Organization of Women.   By 1985, more than three hundred LGBTQ+ student organizations had been formed on college campuses across the country despite the decline in student activism across the nation (D’Emilio, 2013). The days of protesting, advancement in LGBTQ+ inclusive legislation, and the fuel that flamed the Civil Rights Movement extinguished as AIDS devastated the nation and conservativism grew. Stigma grew as widespread misconceptions about AIDS circulated 40  throughout society. Originally called gay-related immunodeficiency, or GRID for short, people began to outwardly show their opposition towards the LGBTQ+ community, specifically towards gay men. The LGBTQ+ community felt defeated and isolated from the rest of society. This may have contributed to why student activism was declining across the nation.   Although the dynamics of LGBTQ+ student activism was changing across the nation, students at the UND were rebuilding and preparing to engage in greater activism work to combat AIDS and growing social opposition. In 1985, twelve students met to form the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles (Office of Student Activities, 1985). One of those students was Holter, president of the organization. Holter expressed how there was a lack of education on campus about LGBTQ+ people, and with the growing concern of AIDS, it was the perfect time to organize. Holter explains, \"more people were coming out, we did not want people to go through the same things we went through, we felt now was an important time to get involved” (J. Holter, personal communication, February 26, 2022). Traynor was also involved in creating the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles. Traynor states, “we chose the name because there was fear of association in the use of the terms gay, lesbian, and homosexual” (P. Traynor, personal communication, December 9, 2021). Stigma towards the LGBTQ+ community was growing as AIDS spread across the nation, and there was such negativity and opposition toward LGBTQ+ people that being associated as part of the community was dangerous. However, Traynor articulated that the name Organization for Alternative Lifestyles created some confusion for international students as they thought the organization was something for them. This too became problematic as there were many international students coming from countries that had strict laws and teachings against LGBTQ+ people. Despite the name challenges, the organization pushed on.  41  Space and funding were important for the success of the organization and becoming a registered student organization was at the upmost importance. Traynor addressed what it meant to become a registered organization:  We needed a space to socialize and meet without being in an adult bookstore on the  down-low in the student union. Registering as an organization was a way to not have to  hide and allowed us to have a space to meet and discuss without fear. (P. Traynor,   personal communication, December 9, 2021)  Once registered, the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles would hold their meetings at the Memorial Union on campus and would average about ten to eleven members in attendance. At the time, there were more lesbian women involved in the organization than gay men. Holter explains, \"it was harder for gay men to be out and involved than for lesbians, part of it was the AIDS crisis. My personal opinion, men were threatened by gay men more than lesbians, it was the macho man attitude that caused this” (J. Holter, personal communication, February 26, 2022). Traynor notes that being an out gay man had its risks, but for some, the risk was worth taking, and it meant disrupting the norm and engaging in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights.   From Resilience to Resistance Education was a prominent position of the organization; members would speak to classrooms about LGBTQ+ experiences and would also hold discussions about AIDS. Many of the organization’s meetings focused on coming out experiences and providing a space for support. Holter discussed one example of how the organization provided support:    There were many conversations about lesbian women adopting children so we would  focus on supporting parents. There was a lesbian couple in Crookston, Minnesota that 42   had sent their kids to school, we showed support to them as they navigated the school  system. (J. Holter, personal communication, February 26, 2022).  For historical context, in the late 1980s, the number of children in foster care had increased by fifty-four percent, and social workers struggled to find homes for the children and would often place them with gay and lesbian parents as that was viewed as a better solution for the children than no home at all (George, 2020). Although there was opposition in the adoption process because of how society defined family values, opportunity was created for LGBTQ+ parents to gain greater visibility and normalize family experiences in the community. The Organization for Alternative Lifestyles was part of that narrative in providing support and advocating for LGBTQ+ parents.  Outside of the classroom and organization meetings, OAL participated in tabling activities to bring attention to AIDS and safe sex practices. The organization partnered with the University Programing Council to hold a safe sex awareness week. They had a booth at the Memorial Union and distributed condoms, lube, safe-sex kits, and educational literature that addressed sexual health risks. The week, however, created some controversy on campus. Traynor states, “there was lots of resistance and criticism from UND administration and student government. This was a health issue, there was a responsibility to the student to have the education” (P. Traynor, personal communication, December 9, 2021). Some of the apprehension focused on how the students came about getting the condoms, and Traynor expressed that there were concerns from students and religious organizations that student fees paid for the condoms when in reality, they were donated.   The organization also experienced opposition from religious groups on campus that organized booths in the Memorial Union to protest OAL’s efforts on AIDS advocacy. Traynor 43  states, “it was only a matter of time before AIDS would get here” (P. Traynor, personal communication, December 9, 2021). UND would not engage in providing AIDS awareness education, and that is why it was so crucial for OAL to put themselves in a vulnerable position on campus and hold the safe sex week. Traynor felt that there was fear from UND administrators that UND would face criticism, experience funding loss, and be at the mercy of state political forces if they were to engage in AIDS awareness and provide educational support. LGBTQ+ students at the University were no longer in a position of being resilient, and they had to take an active stance as no one else would on campus.   AIDS advocacy was at the forefront of conversation in the 1980s. However, the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles would engage in other forms of activism through various campus events. Holter explains, “We were active with the Take Back the Night Rally and would also bring lesbian singers to campus” (J. Holter, personal communication, February 26, 2022). One of the singers Holter referred to was Heather Bishop, a Canadian folk singer and social justice advocate who had focused on LGBTQ+ rights. Early large-scale campus events that promoted LGBTQ+ visibility and human rights provided a foundation for the organization through increased membership and greater awareness of the group on campus and the community, in addition to creating the structure to engage in activism work.    After graduating with his bachelor’s degree, Traynor continued his education at UND to pursue a law degree. Involvement with an LBGTQ+ organization was challenging as it could jeopardize his ability to become a licensed attorney. He recalls, “it was still illegal at the time to be an out gay” (P. Traynor, personal communication, December 9, 2021). Getting involved in LGBTQ+ advocacy threatened careers as there were no workplace protections for LGBTQ+ people. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Georgia’s sodomy law in 44  Bowers v. Hardwick, a law that criminalized oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults. Such cases caused fear among LGBTQ+ people as their livelihood and rights were being taken away through federal court rulings. After graduating with his law degree in 1988, Traynor would continue to give back to the LGBTQ+ community through pro bono legal services with the AIDS Coalition in Minneapolis, Minnesota. LGBTQ+ people assisted other LGBTQ+ people as the nation had failed to serve and protect its most vulnerable population. Traynor’s commitment to serving the LGBTQ+ community contributed to the AIDS activist movement by providing legal support to those impacted by AIDS.   Chapter Summary The Organization for Alternative Lifestyles played a critical role in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights at the UND and in the state, although they may not have known it at the time. This chapter provides an understanding for how LGBTQ+ students organized at UND and in a historically conservative state. The visible existence of organized LGBTQ+ students is resistance, a challenge, and a threat to oppressive structures at the university and in the state. The students may not have understood what they were creating was a foundation for activism that would challenge UND’s commitment to LGBTQ+ students, but they did know the organization had an important role in supporting their peers. Forming the organization did not occur just out of general interest or passion but out of necessity to survive during a trying time in U.S. history. The LGBTQ+ students that initially formed the UND Gay Community and the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles created a visible presence to increase student-led support when university administrators and state legislators would not. They were engaging in radical acts of coming out, organizing LGBTQ+ people, and bringing the fight for equal rights to North Dakota. These acts of resistance created the structural foundation for engaging in activism which would become a 45  necessity in the 1990s. Chapter III explores how LGBTQ+ students experienced outward discrimination on-campus because of anti-LGBTQ+ federal legislation. Greater visibility from the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles exposed LGBTQ+ students to the campus community and resulted in targeted acts of hatred. In Chapter III, historical evidence demonstrates how LGBTQ+ students were shifting their purpose from organizing and providing education to advocating for inclusive policies and institutional support. 46  CHAPTER III DISCRIMINATION, ACTIVISM, AND THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY  This chapter explores how LGBTQ+ students engaged in activism while experiencing forms of discrimination and hate on the University of North Dakota’s campus throughout the 1990s. The Organization for Alternative Lifestyles continued to grow from 1985 into the new decade and advocated for greater community visibility and resources for LGBTQ+ students on campus. The 1990s brought a new era of conservative politics and opposition towards the LGBTQ+ community. AIDS continued to impact the nation, but there was greater awareness as organizations, celebrities, and health clinics began to speak up about HIV and AIDS. National coverage of the grassroots political organization ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, at the 1987 Second March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights led to greater advocacy across the nation. Out of the march came the first celebration of National Coming Out Day in 1988, an idea rooted in the gay liberation movement that focused on coming out to friends, family, and colleagues as a form of activism. Many colleges and universities had LGBTQ+ student groups, faculty, and staff that would engage in Coming Out Day activities by creating campus traditions and doing their part in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in higher education. LGBTQ+ Students at the UND engaged in similar efforts to promote visibility, advocate for equality, and make a difference for LGBTQ+ people in the state.   This chapter articulates how LGBTQ+ students engaged in activism out of necessity as conservative politics and hostility towards the community impacted the campus climate for47  LGBTQ+ students at UND. LGBTQ+ students were in dire need of support resources from the University and officials recognized this, but the narratives captured through oral history and primary source evidence demonstrate how university administration did not commit to supporting LGBTQ+ students. In this chapter, oral history interviews and Dakota Student Articles tell how the Organization of Alternative Lifestyles evolved through name changes and membership to address the challenges that were occurring throughout the 1990s. Former undergraduate students Keith Malaterre, Darin Buri, and Chris Stoner share their experiences during their enrollment at UND. Malaterre narrates the challenges that existed at the intersections of identity as the university was also engaging in conversations of racism that specifically targeted Indigenous students. Malaterre provides insight into his experiences of grappling with his Indigenous identity and sexuality. Darin Buri, a student that enrolled at UND after serving in the U.S. military, articulates the complexities of attending a university later in life while trying to find community. Buri shares his story of how he was involved with the LGBTQ+ student group and the engagement the organization had on campus with combatting AIDS. Lastly, Chris Stoner provides details into the experiences of LGBTQ+ students at UND and navigating incidents of bias with campus administrators as well as demonstrating the frustrations students felt from a lack of support resources. Stoner’s story explores how LGBTQ+ students began to shift from campus-centric advocacy work to engaging in local and statewide activism to create effective change in North Dakota.   The chapter begins with an incident of hate targeting the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles during Coming Out Week in October 1990. The incident shaped the future in how the organization continued to promote LGBTQ+ visibility and provide educational opportunities for the campus community. Similar incidents would occur throughout the early 1990s in addition to 48  acts of racism as the University engaged in the debate over the use of its Fighting Sioux logo and depicting the imagery of an Indigenous person. This articulated the experiences of historically excluded people and what the university was doing to address the growing opposition. By the mid-1990s, LGBTQ+ inclusion remained a challenge with the passing of anti-legislation such as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in 1994 that restricted military service for LGBTQ+ and the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 which defined marriage as only between a man and a woman. This national rhetoric spilled into campus life with UND LGBTQ+ students shifting their focus to just providing support to one another and not engaging in greater campus activities or advocacy. Challenges continued to rise as the Grand Forks Community was devastated by the flooding of the Red River in 1997 which ultimately forced UND to close. The next fall sparked a time of rebuilding for the organization but provided an opportunity for new LGBTQ+ student leaders to redefine the purpose of their organization. Stoner and Buri provide narratives on how the organization rebuilt after the flood and engaged in student activism as incidents of hate grew following the anti-LGBTQ+ acts that were passed.   This chapter continues to explore how LGBTQ+ students shifted their focus from activism on campus to state-wide engagement following the murder of openly gay college student, Matthew Shepard in 1998; Shepard’s murder caught national attention as the worst anti-gay hate crime in the nation. Grassroots organizing to fight for LGBTQ+ equality grew across the state of North Dakota and UND LGBTQ+ students became a part of that narrative. This chapter argues that LGBTQ+ students had to engage in activism out of necessity as university administrators had failed to create support structures, services, and protections for students as lawmakers created discriminatory policies targeting the LGBTQ+ community. The chapter 49  centers on the importance of Coming Out Week celebrations and the role they played in education, coalition building, and challenging conservative values.   National Coming Out Week, 1990   As an established organization on the UND’s campus, the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles (OAL) wanted to recognize National Coming Out Day on Thursday, October 11, 1990, by chalking the University’s sidewalks with positive messages and slogans about gays and lesbians. This was one of the first accounts of LGBTQ+ student activism at UND that had occurred in the 1990s and an act of resistance as the messaging was a visible representation of LGBTQ+ students taking a stand against the opposition they experienced on campus by defying the social expectation to remain hidden from society. The small act of chalking had a significant impact as it was an indicator of LGBTQ+ presence at the University. However, acts of resistance often lead to reactive responses from oppressors. The next day, students, faculty, and staff were welcomed to campus with messages of hate targeting the LGBTQ+ community on the sidewalks. The UND student newspaper, The Dakota Student, wrote a series of articles that captured the details of the incident along with viewpoints from the campus community. Written in chalk were messages such as “go home back door Billy,” “all fags deserve to die,” “anti-anal day,” and “Oct. 12, national back in the closet day” (Menge, 1990).  One member of the OAL, John Lerma, stated in The Dakota Student, “I have never seen an issue that has caused this kind of reaction before...people seem so threatened by this” (Gays misunderstood, 1990). The negative response to the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles demonstrated the ongoing social opposition that LGBTQ+ students experienced at UND. The messages of hate did however illicit response from UND president, Thomas Clifford, who stated, “there are so many people working hard to eliminate racism and intolerance. This is 180 degrees 50  from where the university stands” (Gays misunderstood, 1990). Although President Clifford verbally stated a commitment of support to LGBTQ+ students, there was no action taken to show support. There was no indication of services being provided, such as counseling, support groups, institutional advocacy or educational events on LGBTQ+ experiences, or communication with campus safety on protecting students from any potential physical and emotional harm.   The Dakota Student published a series of articles regarding the anti-LGBTQ+ messages from opposing and supportive viewpoints. One of the viewpoints from Sean LaPlant, president of the College Republicans student group, submitted a letter to the editor by defending the actions of those that wrote the anti-LGBTQ+ messages. An editor’s note also indicated that nineteen other students signed the letter. LaPlant wrote:  Next time the OAL wants to promote one of their activities, I suggest they think before they act. When dealing with a subject such as homosexuality, you are dealing with a very volatile issue. You cannot expect people with opposing views to sit by dormant while things like this go on …what else is there to know about gays except that they are a group of irresponsible sexual deviants spreading the black plague of the 90s (AIDS) in a careless fashion. (LaPlant, 1990)   LaPlant would go on to receive backlash from the article, and letters to the editor submitted by UND students to showed disappointment and opposition towards LaPlant. One of the letters, written by an author named Kevin James Rodlund (1990), expressed that the bigoted comments by LaPlant could have a negative impact on the upcoming North Dakota House of Representatives election for Tom Wentz and Ward Johnson, whom LaPlant had sponsored. Rodlund expressed concern for Wentz and Johnson as having the same values as LaPlant. Another student, Steve Olson (1990), wrote that they found it interesting that LaPlant, along with 51  nineteen other students, signed the letter to the editor when they recalled that twenty students were seen the night before the campus community saw the anti-LGBTQ+ chalk messages. Olson alluded that there might be a connection between LaPlant and the chalk messages.     There was also action taken against LaPlant from the College Republicans and Republican candidates running for a district ward as they did not want LaPlant’s name associated with their campaign. But LaPlant was not alone in his criticism; similar letters of opposition towards LGBTQ+ students from UND students were also written with titles such as “OAL should have expected, anti comments” (Johnson, 1990) and “U support of gay lifestyle is appalling” (Odegaard, 1990). The incidents from the year would continue to shape how LGBTQ+ students would experience forms of oppression and social opposition on campus. This incident demonstrated not just the importance of Coming Out Week as an act of resistance in coming out, but it provided a narrative about how LGBTQ+ students experienced social opposition at UND. Increased Harassment and Discrimination   On April 9, 1991, The Dakota Student published a headline article titled “Crimes against minorities increase” (Swanson, 1991a). The article highlighted several incidents that targeted Native American, Black, and LGBTQ+ students on campus. One incident noted that the University Police Department arrived at a residence hall to remove a sign that had a photograph from the Grand Forks Herald of a gay activist with the words: “wanted dead or alive, $3,000” (Swanson, 1991a). The article notes that similar occurrences had happened on campus according to UND police chief Duane Czapiewski, vice president for student affairs Gordon Henry, and UND affirmative action officer, Sally Page.   52  Another article dated April 16, 1991, describes the experiences of a gay student who was called Mark by the Dakota Student editor Ian Swanson to protect his identity. The article narrates how Mark experienced harassment from his suitemates in the residence hall after coming out. Incidents started with derogatory and threatening messages on Mark’s dry-erase board with messages such as: “All fags must die,” “No butt slamming allowed” which also included a picture of a sexual act, and “No butt fucking allowed” (Swanson, 1991b). Incidents escalated when Mark’s suitemate had changed the phone answering machine in the room to answer calls with the message, “Mark’s in Canada with his Mountie” (Swanson, 1991b). Mark’s mother had called and heard the message and contacted Mark right away to inform him of what his suitemates had done. Thankfully, he had previously come out to his parents; if his parents had not known, Mark could have been outed by the actions of his suitemates. The article continued to state how Mark sought out support from the University Gay and Lesbian Community (UGLC), formerly known as the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles. The organization changed its name in April 1991. Primary source evidence does not indicate why the name change had occurred. In the 1980s, organization member Paul Traynor indicated in his interview that the name Organization for Alternative Lifestyles had caused confusion for some students at UND as articulated in Chapter II. It is possible that the organization members in 1991 felt a name change was necessary to accurately represent the member’s identities in the organization.   The UGLC supported Mark by assisting to report the incident to the UND affirmative action officer and UND Housing. Although there was a process for reporting bias incidents, LGBTQ+ students had to rely on the UGLC to find support resources and learn how to navigate this process. The LGBTQ+ student group remained the primary point of contact for LGBTQ+ 53  students at UND, and they were the ones who had continued to provide education and resources when the university had failed to support students.  At the Intersections of Identity  Keith Malaterre, an undergraduate student enrolled from 1990 to 1993, recalled his experience as an Indigenous and gay student (K. Malaterre, personal communication, December 9, 2021). Malaterre knew of the LGBTQ+ student group on campus but was not involved. Malaterre was not out yet, and part of that was because he was pursuing a degree in education. At the time, being a gay teacher would have cost Malaterre his entire career. Another challenge that Malaterre faced was that he wanted to go back to his hometown to teach in a local school. The problem was that his hometown was a strong Catholic community that maintained high opposition towards LGBTQ+ people. Malaterre felt that if he were to come out, he would have been ostracized by his community and lose all opportunities to teach and hiding his sexuality was of the utmost importance. In North Dakota, LGBTQ+ people did not have employment protections and could be terminated from their job because of their sexuality. Malaterre expressed this as a concern in education because there was a perception that LGBTQ+ educators were a threat to children and corrupted them with perversion. These negative viewpoints made it difficult for LGBTQ+ people to live authentically.  In addition to suppressing his sexuality, Malaterre also navigated what it meant to be Indigenous at UND. The early 1990s witnessed the continuation of the Fighting Sioux logo controversy and growing opposition toward Indigenous people in the state. The controversy was over the use of Indigenous imagery and the nickname of the University’s athletics programs. Those in opposition to the logo referred to it as being racist and discriminatory. Malaterre recalled how his roommate, who was also Indigenous, would be called derogatory names while 54  they were walking to class. Students that held intersecting identities were met with multiple challenges. They were not just gay or Indigenous. Rather, they held both identities simultaneously and had to learn how to navigate varying aspects of their identity in different spaces on campus. For LGBTQ+ students they were not just navigating a race or ethnicity as they often also faced opposition because of their sexuality in their racial or ethnic communities, too.   Malaterre expressed how he maintained a low profile while attending UND in the early 1990s. He was not involved in UND’s LGBTQ+ community as he found a sense of belonging through his connections with other Indigenous students. Malaterre’s story demonstrates the challenges UND faced with supporting its historically excluded student populations. It also highlights how LGBTQ+ people were mindful of their involvement in different organizations as it could potentially cost them their future careers. In Chapter II, Traynor articulated how his involvement with the Organization for Alternative Lifestyles came with risks as it could have impacted his ability to become an attorney. The narrative held true into the 1990s as Malaterre had the same perception while he pursued a career in education.   Lessons Learned   On Oct. 8, 1991, The Dakota Student published articles relating to National Coming Out Week. A headline article, “One year later: UGLC hopes to erase prejudice,” focused on the reactions to the National Coming Out Week anti-LGBTQ+ messages in 1990 (Shockman, 1991). In the article, Dan Albertson, President of the UGLC, had stated that the organization had twenty-five members and was mostly made up of gay males. This was a shift from the 1980s when the organization’s members primarily consisted of lesbian women. Primary source evidence does not account for the reasons why there were more men involved in the organization 55  than women now. There could have been several factors contributing to this phenomenon, and it could have resulted from change in organizational leadership or the groups focus. Further study is needed here to understand why this occurred.   The 1991 National Coming Out Week shifted more towards educational opportunities instead of sidewalk chalking. It’s goal was to help create a more inclusive campus and bring awareness about LGBTQ+ issues in society. After incidents from the previous year’s National Coming Out Week and growing incidents of harassment, it would make sense why there was a slight shift in recognizing the week. Albertson articulates, “there have been no proven or reported physical attacks on anyone at UND because of their sexual orientation. But there have been instances where gays and lesbians have been psychologically terrorized” (Swanson, 1991c). There was still concern regarding the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ students on campus, and tensions were high as opposition continued to grow. A second article in The Dakota Student highlighted Albertson and called “coming out, a necessity” (Swanson, 1991c). In this article, Albertson recalls an outcome from 1990 National Coming Out Week: We did not know how much support we would have. We found out that there are a lot more gay faculty and staff members than we thought and also that there were a large number of straight people on this campus who supported what we were doing. (Swanson, 1991c).  The UGLC may have found support from out faculty and staff and straight allies, but one challenge was how the response to the 1990 chalking impacted people’s comfort and ability to come out. Albertson states, “it was embarrassing that no one came out of the closet last year. We learned something in the process last year” (Swanson, 1991c). The students had hoped to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ experiences with the chalking. What they did not anticipate was the 56  impact the action would have on the community in North Dakota. The LGBTQ+ students were operating through trial-by-error as they did not have guidance or connections to larger LGBTQ+ community organizations. They were the trailblazers in the state. The 1991 National Coming Out Week at UND had programs and activities that were specifically geared toward heterosexuals to help educate them about LGBTQ+ people.   Additionally, the article helped increase LGBTQ+ visibility as it highlighted Albertson as a gay man at UND. Albertson expressed in the article that he knew a man in Minneapolis, MN that was murdered that summer because he was gay. Albertson stated that he had concerns about people’s reactions who had learned about his identity and experiences from the article. However, he states “I would not go back in the closet for any amount of money. It is important to be yourself” (Swanson 1991c). This article helped contextualize the thoughts and experiences of LGBTQ+ students in the early 1990s as they exposed their identity on campus and tried to create effective change.   Student Activity Fees  The University Gay and Lesbian Community gained significant attention in 1992 as they hosted Bob and Rod Jackson-Paris, two high profile speakers and married gay men, as keynote speakers for Coming Out Week (Krank, 1992a). The keynote was sponsored by the UGLC, University Programming Council (UPC), and the Multicultural Awareness Committee and was set for Wednesday, October 14, 1992, at the Chester Fritz Auditorium. An estimated eight-hundred and seventy-five people attended the lecture, but controversy sparked over the use of student fees. The Dakota Student published a series of articles that articulated complaints about the lecture and called it a misuse of student activity fees (Krank, 1992b). The event coordinators used $4,750 in student fees to bring the keynote speakers to campus. Krank (1992b) highlighted 57  students in their Dakota Student article who were in opposition of the UPC sponsoring the event. UND student Christy Hunt did not believe that student fees should be used to sponsor an event that only applied to a few students. Hunt was also upset that the speakers talked about their future plans of raising a child. Hunt expressed in an article that LGBTQ parents lose the balance of a two-gender household, and the children themselves may become LGBTQ+. Another student, Eric Pelletier, a first-year student in the aviation program was also quoted in the article. Pelletier had a similar view to Hunt and agreed that the fees should have been used to represent all students, and the message about LGBTQ+ people raising a child was “immoral” (Krank, 1992b).   The opinions in the article showed that students demonstrated strong feelings of opposition towards LGBTQ+ speakers on campus, and messages about LGBTQ+ people holding traditional family values, like raising children, were wrong; this mindset held true to the national perceptions and acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. However, Joe Kalenze, a student leader for the UPC felt the lecture was beneficial to the campus community. Kalenze states, “I think the campus needed this. It is a conservative campus. Nothing like this comes to Grand Forks” (Krank, 1992b). Kalenze’s quote eludes to a shared understanding of the conservative nature and social opposition experienced by LGBTQ+ people at UND and in the community.   This lecture highlighted ongoing opposition LGBTQ+ students experience on college campuses with being treated equally and having access to the same activities and resources as the majority student population. History demonstrates how LGBTQ+ people have been excluded from utilizing student activity fees for various events, activities, lectures, etc. even though they pay students fees as part of their college enrollment as well (Cain & Hevel, 2021). The UGLC used their right to access student activity fees to host an event and were criticized. Kalenze was 58  disappointed with how people were questioning the use of student fees when that was not a concern in the past. Kalenze states, “it is because of the content of this lecture. They do not think a homosexual lecture should be sponsored with their money” (Krank, 1992b). Additionally, Kalenze was concerned with how the complaints impacted the image of UND and said, “Homophobia is a bad thing any way you look at it. If there is a big deal made out of it, it makes it look like there are a bunch of homophobes at the University of North Dakota,” (Krank, 1992b).  Following the event and the complaints about the lecture, The Dakota Student published an article to address its stance on LGBTQ+ inclusion and the challenges that LGBTQ+ students continue to face at the University. Editor Kammy Krank (1992c) wrote that the Rod and Bob Jackson-Paris lecture was a step in the right direction, but there is still significant work to be done to include LGBTQ+ people. Krank expressed that the Dakota Student has a responsibility to address what is happening on campus and that includes forms of discrimination. As the weeks continued, news about the Jackson-Paris lecture faded into the past as attention moved towards the upcoming U.S. presidential election and concern about LGBTQ+ people and military service.   A New Norm on Campus  Articles in The Dakota Student continued to feature stories about the UGLC over the next few years, specifically during the annual Coming Out Week in October. A headline story in 1993 featured Ann, a lesbian student that moved from to Grand Forks from Southern California. Ann states, “coming here is scary because homophobia just seems larger in small towns” (Johnson, 1993). Ann joined the UGLC but notes that she was one of only two lesbians in the organization which made her feel isolated in her experience as a lesbian on campus. The article brought 59  attention to the experiences of LGBTQ+ students that felt like outsiders in Grand Forks as they once had a community in their previous location and lost it when they moved to attend UND. The article stressed the importance of the Coming Out Week activities, and the goal was to broaden awareness of LGBTQ+ experiences on campus and increase involvement in UGLC. The Coming Out Week activities in 1993 focused on community awareness about LGBTQ+ experiences with an emphasis on what it means to come out.   One of the Coming Out Week events in 1993 was a display of the AIDS Memorial Quilt. MaryAnne Lustgraaf, director of the Memorial Union, helped coordinate the event and states, “it is a great educational tool. This is a disease that people are getting here and they need to educate themselves about it” (Seibel, 1993). The AIDS Memorial Quilt at UND made news about AIDS real to students as they were able to view a small section of the quilt with names of individuals that had passed from AIDS along with their stories. Staff members of the UND Memorial Union created a panel for a student employee they had worked with who died from AIDS a couple of years prior. The panel was six feet by three feet and was added to the quilt during its display at UND. One of the goals of the display was not just to bring awareness but also to combat AIDS stigma that had impacted the LGBTQ+ community. The 1993 Coming Out Week helped engage the campus in a conversation about LGBTQ+ experiences, but the UGLC struggled with promoting greater visibility. The article in the Dakota Student used pseudonyms to protect the identities of the UGLC student leaders. In the years prior, the presidents and other organization leaders made their identity known publicly. This shift could have been a result of the overall campus attitude and perceptions of LGBTQ+ students.   60  In 1994, leaders of the UGLC addressed how LGBTQ+ awareness was growing slowly but had a long way to go as Coming Out Week approached. Sam Toles, an out undergraduate student and co-chair of the UGLC, states in The Dakota Student:  The good thing is that I do not see it (discrimination) increasing too much, a little  perhaps. But as far as lessening, I do not see any market change in that director. The burden in gaining greater acceptance must fall on the gay community. (Castagna,   1994a)   In the article, the other co-chair of the UGLBC and undergraduate student, Vanessa Hunt articulates how being a part of UGLBC was challenging for many members. She states, “a lot of members still do not want to have public announcement of where the meetings are at” (Castagna, 1994a). Hunt notes that the “hush-hush” mentality of the group made it difficult for increasing membership as many students were not aware that UGLBC even existed. The article indicated that there were fifteen students in the group and fourteen of them were male. Primary source evidence does not account for gender disparities that existed within the organization. However, Toles expresses that the UGLBC was experiencing internal conflict as the group explored what it meant to be out and visible on campus:  Another big problem that our group has is the fact that there is constantly this pull between the people who want to be out and aggressive and then the people who want to be in the closet and that is always going to be there. (Castagna, 1994a)   One of the challenges that many LGBTQ+ student groups and organizations throughout history have experienced is that with greater visibility comes greater response. This was evident from the first coordination of Coming Out Week in 1990 with messages of hate to the continual opposition that was experienced by the students in 1993. Members of the UGLC may have felt 61  the negative impact of what it meant to have greater visibility on campus. Past events showed the students that they would have to address opposition and there was rarely any support from university administration. The divide in how members of the UGLC wanted to engage on campus may have been a result of those past experiences.  By the start of Coming Out Week in October 1994, the UGLC had changed its name to the University Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Community (UGLBC). The name change was first identified in the Dakota Student in an article featuring Sam Toles, the organization’s co-chair (Castagna, 1994b). The article did not indicate why the name change occurred, but the expansion of identities in the name could have been an attempt to create greater inclusion and representation of identities held by members of the organization.   Growing LGBTQ+ Visibility, Growing Opposition  As The Dakota Student highlighted LGBTQ+ stories, opposition grew and became more outspoken. The Bible Baptist Church was one of those outspoken voices. The first article appeared in 1994 titled “Reader disagrees with homosexuality” containing a letter quoting biblical versus to condemn LGBTQ+ people (Kuzel, 1994). The letter sparked a resurgence of anti-LGBTQ+ messages and would lead to another incident of hate on-campus similar to that of the hate messages chalked on campus in 1990. On October 13, 1994, anti-LGBTQ+ messages were chalked on the sidewalks near McCannel Hall and the Memorial Union. One of the chalkings reported read, “silly faggot, dicks are for chicks” (Castagna, 1994c). Dan Albertson, former president of the UGLBC became aware of the chalkings and stated, “I do not see it as that major of an issue. I see it as a small isolated incident” (Castagna, 1994c). In the article, Albertson recalled the anti-LGBTQ+ chalkings in 1990:   62  It made several newspapers across the country. It was a big deal up here. You could not go anywhere on campus four years ago without hearing somebody talk about it. It was very vulgar. They were drawing depictions of people in a sex act. It was extremely vulgar. (Castagna, 1994b)   Albertson expressed that since 1990, there had not been much anti-LGBTQ+ material on campus. However, Albertson did state, “there was one posting in the library a few years back declaring open hunting season on homosexuals during their ‘mating season’ because it was coming out week” (Castagna, 1994c). Albertson acknowledged that the chalkings in 1994 should not be ignored. He states, “in a way, it kind of highlights the fact that more work needs to be done on this campus in dealing with some of the hostile attitudes that people have towards people who are different” (Castagna, 1994c).  Albertson’s reflection on the anti-LGBTQ+ chalk messages demonstrated the ongoing challenges that LGBTQ+ people faced on campus over multiple years. Albertson spoke about an incident from 1990 that was repeated in 1994 during Coming Out Week. The incidents both occurred during Coming Out Week and alluded to the attitudes some on campus had towards the LGBTQ+ community relating to the recognition of the week.   The Bible Baptist Church continued to demonstrate its opposition towards LGBTQ+ students through the Baptist Campus Ministry, an affiliated student organization in 1995. Advisor Scott Kuzel and organization president Paul Nelson wrote a letter to the editor titled “Reader: God endorses coming out” (1995). The title was misleading as the article used biblical versus to condemn LGBTQ+ people and used the phrase “coming out” as means to convert people from being LGBTQ+ and be “saved.” In 1996, Baptist Campus Ministries advisor, Scott Kuzel wrote another letter to the editor in The Dakota Student (1996) following Coming Out 63  Week in October. The letter may have been a response to the Coming Out Week activities that focused on LGBTQ+ rights theme with the slogan “Pride not prejudice” (Staff Report, 1996). The 1996 Coming Out Week followed the difficult passing of the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that targeted LGBTQ+ people and supported religious ideologies by defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman. The Baptist Campus Ministries under the advisement of Kuzel may have used the opportunity of the federal law’s passage to demonstrate an ongoing presence of opposition towards LGBTQ+ students on campus. The two opposing organizations reflected the continual societal conflict between religion, politics, and LGBTQ+ rights.  In 1996, the UGLBC changed its name to the Ten Percent Society. The name reflected a popular belief that ten percent of the population identified as gay according to a study on sexuality by Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s and 1950s. New leadership of the organization changed the direction of the group’s purpose to taking a more active role in addressing the concerns of LGBTQ+ students on campus. The theme for the Coming Out Week events, now called Gay Awareness Week, articulated the need for greater visibility, pride, and action in supporting LGBTQ+ students. The new drive may have been motivated by the passing of the Defense of Marriage Act. Additionally, Gay Awareness Week followed UND’s homecoming week with the theme “Proud to Be UND” (Bjorke, 1996). Student groups kept to the theme to address issues that had occurred on campus. A group of Black students had organized to address the welfare of students on campus following an incident of graffiti in the residence hall depicting a lynching (Bjorke, 1996). The controversial use of the Fighting Sioux mascot alongside each of the highlighted concerns on campus continued to question the UND’s commitment to diversity  Rebuilding and Finding Purpose  64  Getting involved with the Ten Percent Society was not easy. Darin Buri was an undergraduate student in 1996 and just beginning his coming out journey. Buri was a non-traditional student as he joined the military before attending college. Grappling with his sexuality, marriage, and military service led Buri to meet with the University Counseling Center. Tim Seaworth was one of the counselors that Buri met and was his connection to the Ten Percent Society. Seaworth introduced Buri to the president of the organization to get involved as there was not a lot of information on where or when meetings occurred. Buri provided a brief description of where meetings occurred:  Once you found out about the meeting you had to write down the address. Some  members rented houses near campus and that is where we would meet. Sometimes we met at the Women’s Center. We had to use the side door for privacy reasons. No cameras were allowed. (D. Buri, personal communication, December 3, 2021)  Buri recalls going to a Ten Percent Society meeting at the same time as first-year student Chris Stoner. Buri states, “we looked in each other’s car and knew we were going to the same place. Chris was carrying a cake and went to the wrong house” (D. Buri, personal communication, December 3, 2021).   Chris Stoner had a different experience getting involved with the Ten Percent Society than Buri. At the time, student organizations had booths in the Memorial Union where students could call organizations to get involved. Stoner called the Ten Percent Society about getting involved but had to leave a voice message as no one answered. Stoner recalls the phone conversation he had with the Ten Percent Society member who returned his call:  They asked if I was looking to get involved on campus. I did not know what they were talking about, I did not call anyone about getting involved on campus. The conversation 65  was confusing. We eventually got to the point of me joining the Ten Percent Society. They were hesitant about sharing information with me, it sounded like they were   whispering on the other end of the line. (C. Stoner, personal communication, January 5, 2022)  Buri’s and Stoner’s experiences allude to the caution that was exercised by members of the Ten Percent Society with getting new students involved with the organization. Privacy was of the utmost importance and may have been a result of the opposition experienced by the Baptist Campus Ministries and relating to the anti-LGBTQ+ policies and laws that were enacted across the nation. Buri notes that the Ten Percent Society primarily focused on community building up until the end of the spring 1997 semester when the city was devastated by the Red River flood. With floodwaters rising, UND officials made the decision to cancel the remainder of the semester on April 18, 1997.   A New Start  The fall semester after the flood of 1997 gave way to new opportunities for the Ten Percent Society. The organization required new leadership and one of those leaders was Chris Stoner. Stoner quickly became a voice for the Ten Percent Society through interviews and writing letters in The Dakota Student. In one article by undergraduate staff writer of the Dakota Student Dave Dodds captured a narrative of LGBTQ+ issues. In the article, Stoner addresses the nature of LGBTQ+ acceptance on campus in regard to anti-gay and lesbian activity:  It occurs most often in subtle ways. For instance, we will see it when we put up  advertising and it gets ripped down. From time to time we will have confrontations with other groups on campus, but these confrontations are usually only letters back and forth in the Dakota Student or something of that nature. (Dodds, 1997)   66  The Ten Percent Society continued with Gay Awareness Week, now called Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week. The week’s title change may have been in part to the organization’s shift in focus to be more inclusive of its membership. The past few years demonstrated a decline in women members. It is possible that the addition of the term “lesbian” in the title of the awareness week was a form of intentional recruitment of women into the organization. Stoner describes the newfound purpose of the Ten Percent Society that reflected its name change and approach to addressing LGBTQ+ issues on campus, a shift from visibility to advocacy:  We serve as an advocate, educating the community on lesbian and gay issues and things that come up around campus, but we also serve as a social organization, giving gay and lesbians a chance to socialize in a more open and relaxed atmosphere. (Dodds, 1997)   A new focus allowed the organization to engage in various types of advocacy and community building work. Buri expresses how the Ten Percent Society engaged in sexual health advocacy and education about HIV and AIDS:  We would have info tables in the Memorial Union near the old bookstore where we   would hand out condoms and educational materials. We would have some groups protest, mainly religious fundamental groups. They would have people take all the condoms and leave religious notes. (D. Buri., personal communication, December 3, 2021)  HIV and AIDS remained a concern in the nation throughout the late 1990s, and the Ten Percent Society was one of few organizations in Grand Forks that took an active role in providing prevention education to the LGBTQ+ community. Buri recalled how the Ten Percent Society would host HIV positive speakers and hold testing events. Buri states, “people were scared. They had concerns about the testing and would say things such as do I have to sign my name or what happens if I am positive” (D. Buri., personal communication, December 3, 2021). 67  This education was important, but the organization was often met with resistance from religious-based organizations. Stoner expressed specific detest for Baptist Campus Ministries, he states, “they are the joker to my batman,” a cultural television reference of the conflict between a superhero and villain (C. Stoner, personal communication, January 5, 2022).    The Ten Percent Society’s activism work grew out of necessity. The mid to late 1990s demonstrated a growing opposition toward LGBTQ+ people with the U.S. Government’s institutionalized discrimination that allowed for greater acts of targeted bigotry and hatred than previously experienced. Activism was needed for the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights across the nation, in the state, and on campus. Stoner expressed how support on campus for LGBTQ+ students had little to no existence. Over this long period of time, even as some staff and students lent their quiet support, there is no evidence of university administration taking steps to tangibly improve the campus environment for LGBTQ+ students. Stone recalled an experience of vandalism to a vehicle near one of the residence halls that had threatening messages targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Stoner shares his frustrations in trying to seek out support:   I called the UND Counseling Center for LGBTQ services, nothing. I called the  Community Violence Intervention Center in Grand Forks, nothing. So I wrote a letter to the editor to explain what lesbian and gay students experienced on campus. (C. Stoner, personal communication, January 5, 2022)   The lack of services to support LGBTQ+ students resulted in the Ten Percent Society to be the place where students found support. This burdened the members of the organization with creating resources and support structures while having to address the impact of the incidents on their own well-being. Stoner expresses how he would advocate to different departments on campus and engage in discussions about the lack of services, but empty promises were always 68  made when it came to developing support structures on campus. This was the beginning of the Ten Percent Society’s journey of greater activism work on campus and in Grand Forks.  Self-Advocacy  Near the end of Stoner’s sophomore year, he experienced discrimination at his on-campus student employment. Stoner worked in UND Housing as a student assistant and had no concerns until he had a new supervisor. Stoner recalls that everything was going well until he started to bring up aspects concerning diversity in the workplace. Once the conversations began, Stoner indicates that the work experience changed. Stoner was terminated from his position, and he believes it was a result of the religious views of his supervisor. Stoner explained the situation:  I went to the Housing director to file a complaint. My file showed that I was “missing things, work was not good” although I had never received any complaints about my work in the past nor have I had any conversations about my work performance. (C. Stoner, personal communication, January 5, 2022) Stoner feels he was discriminated against because of his sexuality and sought justice for the actions. The housing director did not know how to file a complaint of discrimination based on sexuality; they directed Stoner to visit the director of financial aid as student employment fell under that area of university operations. The director of financial aid also did not understand how to navigate the situation and process a complaint. This resulted in Stoner having to work closely with the director and educate them on how to navigate the employment discrimination process. Stoner, a student, became the educator and had to advocate for himself in a process that university officials seemed unable to understand and navigate.   Situations like this demonstrate the challenges that LGBTQ+ students continued to face on campus to find support through processes such as filing a discrimination or bias incident 69  report. LGBTQ+ students had to advocate for themselves as they received little to no support from administrators. An additional challenge was that students were not just experiencing opposition from their peers but also from faculty and staff and their supervisors on campus, the very individuals that were supposed to be there to support student success and well-being.   Grassroots Organizing  On Monday, October 12, 1998, openly gay University of Wyoming student, Matthew Shepard died after being beaten, tortured, tied to a fence, and left to die near Laramie, WY. Shepard’s murder gained national attention as the worst anti-gay hate crime in U.S. history. At UND, the Ten Percent Society hosted presentations, panels, discussions, and lectures for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender History Month with the goal to help prevent tragedies, such as Shepard’s death, from happening at UND (Wyoming Hate Crime, 1998).   Shepard’s death shifted conversations across the nation regarding the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. In March 1998, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force coordinated a nationwide week of action for gay and lesbian quality. A Dakota Student article highlighted the efforts of the week of action called “Equality Begins at Home” (Richards, 1999). The article indicates that an LGBTQ+ rights organization, Equality North Dakota, formed out of the Equality Beings at Home project. One of the founding members of Equality North Dakota, David Whitcomb, stressed the importance of student engagement in the organization (Richards, 1999). Whitcomb was an assistant professor of counseling at UND and had a prior history of working with the Ten Percent Society. Equality North Dakota started at the ground level and would need student support to help make a difference in the fight for equality in the state. The article also indicates that North Dakota was the last state to organize a state-wide gay and lesbian organization. Lucy Ganje, an associate professor at UND, spoke at one of Equality Begins at Home events. Ganje 70  brought attention to the fact that nearly one-thousand signatures were presented to the 1999 Legislative Session in North Dakota calling for the creation and funding of a North Dakota Human Rights Commission, an organization that that would look at illegal discrimination. North Dakota was the only state in the nation that did not have this type of commission.   The Ten Percent Society was actively involved with “Equality Begins at Home.” A group of representatives traveled to Bismarck, North Dakota to attend the events and engage in advocacy work. Stoner, now president of the Ten Percent Society articulates, “it is just important that people know they do not have to be gay or lesbian to support this. It is everyone working together to move what is right, and that is that we all have equal rights” (Richards, 1999). The Ten Percent Society’s engagement in state activism through grassroots organizations was important for the future of LGBTQ+ rights in North Dakota. As the new millennium approached, the Ten Percent Society would engage in a re-organizing process and expand their engagement in LGBTQ+ rights activism beyond the UND.   Chapter Summary  This chapter provides an understanding for how LGBTQ+ students began to shift their focus from campus advocacy to engaging in statewide activism in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. The 1990s demonstrates a time of seeking out purpose and identity for the Ten Percent Society as it explored several name changes and experienced various forms of outward discrimination. This chapter narrates how the Ten Percent Society found its outlet for activism through its National Coming Out Week activities. In the early 1990s, the organization focused on creating a platform of coming out and being visible to create a community. Attempts to establish a visible presence on campus had an adverse effect as social opposition grew through acts of hatred and bigotry toward LGBTQ+ students. The experiences of discrimination on campus with no 71  evidence of support from UND administration caused the student group to redefine its purpose and step back into a role of promoting awareness instead of visibility.  By the mid to late 1990s, the Ten Percent Society found a new purpose as systemic oppression motivated LGBTQ+ students to engage in the fight for equal rights. Acts of discrimination on campus, the need for self-advocacy in navigating university policy, and the opportunity to engage in state grassroots organizing prompted the Ten Percent Society to engage in activism work. The shift from on-campus efforts to create an inclusive environment to creating systematic change in state-level policies created a new outlet for students to engage in the larger fight for LGBTQ+ rights. The next chapter expands on how the Ten Percent Society engaged in state-level politics and navigated challenges on campus with receiving a commitment of support from the University. Chapter IV centers on the 2000s with a historical perspective on oppressive state legislation that led grassroots efforts to create effective local change and situate the UND as a cultural battleground in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality with the development of the Pride Center to provide LGBTQ+ programs and services. 72  CHAPTER IV OPPRESIVE STATE POLITICS  Anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from the 1990s would continue to shape opposition toward LGBTQ+ people in North Dakota but gave way to greater advocacy work from grassroots organizations. The 2000s brought new challenges from the state where conservative politics would hinder progress for LGBTQ+ rights. The Ten Percent Society had shifted from university-centric advocacy work to state-level political activism to engage in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. This chapter analyzes the impact conservative politics had on LGBTQ+ rights and how students engaged in efforts to combat oppressive legislation and anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric locally and in the state. Memories recalled by Keith Malaterre. Darin Buri, and Chris Stoner capture how the Ten Percent Society engaged in protest an set the stage for future involvement with political activism throughout the early 2000s. Articles from local news sources, such as the Dakota Student, Grand Forks Herald, and Inforum identify key narratives that address the political climate and show a history of continuous opposition toward LGBTQ+ people in the state. Additionally, Charles Vondal, a Grand Forks local and UND undergraduate student informs how the development of LGBTQ+ programs and services at the University of North Dakota (UND) impacted the future of the Ten Percent Society by creating a shift in purpose for the organization in the late 2010s.   This chapter begins with how a larger queer presence on campus in the early 2000s led to protests by the Westboro Baptist Church, a notorious anti-LGBTQ+ organization. The protest was followed by the beginnings of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the state with the passing of a state constitutional measure against same-sex marriage in 2004. This led to a series of non-73  discrimination bills to protect LGBTQ+ people from 2009 to 2017 that failed to pass in the North Dakota state legislature. During this time, the Ten Percent Society demonstrated the power of local activism with the passing of a Grand Forks City ordinance to protect LGBTQ+ people in 2013. The chapter ends with the creation of the Pride Center at UND in 2017 while highlighting the challenges students would endure following its establishment. This timeline of events demonstrates how conservative state politics have continued to influence social opposition of LGBTQ+ people and tell a story of queer resistance. Although the North Dakota legislature was not creating protections for LGBTQ+ people, UND had demonstrated a beginning to its commitment to LGBTQ+ students with the development of LGBTQ+ programs and services. The creation of the Pride Center was significant as UND was the first higher education institution in the state to create a physical space and support services for LGBTQ+ students.   This chapter recounts how LGBTQ+ students engaged in activism to combat legislative oppression and demand a commitment from the University to demonstrate support in the form of LGBTQ+ programs and services. These efforts were multifaceted as the Ten Percent Society helped write legislation for both the state and locally in Grand Forks but also shaping institutional support on campus simultaneously. The chapter connects to the larger argument on how LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support resources, not just at the university but across North Dakota, this holds true to its origins as the first LGBTQ+ rights organization in the state. In this chapter, activism is explored from 2000 through 2017 with the creation of the UND Pride Center followed by the challenges that occurred in 2018 with maintaining a presence of diversity, equity, and inclusion student support services and initiatives. A Queer Presence on Campus  74  National Coming Out Week held an important role in UND’s LGBTQ+ history and would continue in the year 2000. Something was different that year though as the Ten Percent Society had a greater visible presence on campus compared to the past. Stoner articulates that the Ten Percent Society had grown and changed over the last five years. He states in a Dakota Student article, “we are trying to build a sense of community, counter with education and to create a safe, friendly and respectful atmosphere” (Pierce, 2000). The organization was not just focused on creating a community on campus for LGBTQ+ students but expand their reach to the Grand Forks community as well. The Ten Percent Society had become an advocate for the LGBTQ+ local community and kept close ties of membership consisting of students and Grand Forks community members. This shift may have been in part due to the growing engagement in the state organization, Equality North Dakota.   The Ten Percent Society did not just have a stronger presence in classrooms and growing membership of the organization, but they also became more involved in campus traditions, such as Homecoming. The organization created a float for the Homecoming parade and won the float contest, and a photo was printed in the October 10, 2000 issue of the Dakota Student. The float that was created was not just for fun as it was a statement on equality and act of resistance as the float depicted the Ten Percent Society’s own election of a Homecoming king and queen. This act was a significant achievement for LGBTQ+ people at UND as it helped strengthen visibility but also showed the campus community that LGBTQ+ students engage in activities and everyday life just like other students. Greater visibility helped normalize the presence and experiences of LGBTQ+ students on UND’s campus.   Protests  75  Greater visibility on campus does have its risks as larger organizations that demonstrate outward opposition can easily target people because of their growing presence. That is exactly what happened in November 2002 as the Westboro Baptist Church staged a protest against UND for its LGBTQ+ involvement on campus. According to the Dakota Student, the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), a radical anti-LGBTQ+ church group from Wichita, Kansas notorious for its “God Hates Fags” messaging, had stated its purpose for protesting at UND on its website:  UND has become a malodorous cesspool of filthy, sinful fag/dyke oral/anal copulation –   A propaganda mill and recruiting depot seducing naïve youth to experiment – a pink swastika tyranny punishing all bible opposition to fag sin. (Timpe, 2002)  The Dakota Student wrote an article about the protest. The article indicated that The Ten Percent Society planned a counter protest but wanted to keep it as a silent protest. Stoner states, “we expect at least one hundred people. But we are prepared for as many as 300” (Widdel, 2002).  The Ten Percent Society was not alone in staging the protest as the University Democrats, the Electric Minds Society, Greek Community, UND Indian Association, BRIDGES, and PFLAG were among many of the groups willing to demonstrate their solidarity. Keith Malaterre, now a graduate student at UND recalls the day the protests had occurred:  “The Ten Percent Society and allied picketed the Westboro Baptist Church with a huge rainbow sheet to block their view. The Westboro Baptist Church had derogatory signage ‘God hates fags’. There was a huge community turnout, it took attention away from the WBC. (K. Malaterre, personal communication, December 9, 2021)  Darin Buri was continuing his enrollment at UND in 2002 and remained actively involved with the Ten Percent Society and also recalls the protests:  There were about 250 people there to protest, the WBC had about 10 people. There was  76  lots of community support. We were warned that the WBC tried to provoke people then will sue them if anything happens. They would film you while getting in your face. (D. Buri, personal communication, December 2, 2021)   The tactics used by the Westboro Baptist Church were meant to be threatening in hopes to provoke a negative reaction of those they targeted. Member of the WBC, Katherine Hockenbarger, articulated in a Dakota Student article that they videotaped their protests because it was not unusual for the group to be attacked, and the videotape served as extra protection (Foss & Buckley, 2002).   The Dakota Student reported that approximately three hundred students, faculty, staff, and community members counterprotested the nine members of the Westboro Baptist Church (Foss & Buckley, 2002). The article addresses how founder of the WBC, Fred Philips, was not in attendance of the protest, but his son, Jon Phelps, was present. Members of the WBC held signs with messaging including, “pro-gay media shame,” “No tears for queers”, and “Matt 4 yrs. in hell” which was a reference to Matthew Shepard, the out gay University of Wyoming student who was murdered in 1998. Counter-protesters had their own signage including the rainbow-colored “wall” as recalled by Malaterre. The protest remained peaceful. Vice President of Student and Outreach Services, Robert Boyd, expresses in the article that the protest did not change the minds of UND’s view of the Ten Percent Society. Boyd addresses the protest:  The Ten Percent Society is one of our student organizations that we have recognized as a legitimate student organization and there is absolutely no reason for that to change...a university is an environment that welcomes and encourages differences of opinion, but it does not mean that we endorse it. (Foss & Buckley, 2002)   77  The statement provided by the university administrator was significant as it was one of the first moments the LGBTQ+ student group was recognized in name by a university official and an expressed commitment of support from the institution.   State Conservative Politics and Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation  In 2003, Grand Forks citizens and employees at UND, Kimberly Porter and Linda Baeza announced their union in the Grand Forks Herald and became the first same-sex couple in the state to successfully have their announcement published (Lee, 2003). The announcement was shocking to the Grand Forks community and triggered a series of responses from readers. UND Professor, Kathleen Tiemann, wrote a journal article about an exploratory study that provided content analysis of the letters written to the Grand Forks Herald about Porter and Baeza. A total of twenty letters were published that primarily focused on intolerance and cited Christian values in opposition of the announcement (Tiemann, 2008). The expressed viewpoints against Porter and Baeza’s announcement were not just shared in Grand Forks but were the conversations and mindsets of the people across North Dakota. In November 2004, North Dakota voters ratified “Measure 1,” a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman and that no other union can be recognized as marriage (Statewide Measure Results, 2004). This began a series of statewide anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and a shift from social opposition to outward discrimination.   Equality in Employment, Housing, and Public Accommodation, 2009  The fight in the political arena for LGBTQ+ rights in North Dakota began with the introduction of a state bill that would add sexual orientation as a protected class as part of the state’s Human Rights and Fair Housing Acts. According to the Grand Forks Herald, members of the Ten Percent Society met with community members in downtown Grand Forks on January 18, 78  2009 to announce the bill and advocated for its importance in guaranteeing human rights (Nadeau, 2009a). The bill was not about marriage equality or unions but of equal rights in employment and housing. Ten Percent Society President, Bo Chung, was interviewed in the article. He states, “right now, people in North Dakota can be fired or evicted because of their sexual orientation” (Nadeau, 2009a). The shift away from marriage equality to employment and housing protections may have been a result from the defeat in 2004 or the possibility that community organizers felt this approach would have a greater likelihood of passing in the North Dakota legislature.   In 2009, North Dakota campaigned to get more people to the state. It was the height of the oil boom which played an important role in the economic development of North Dakota. However, for LGBTQ+ people, they would feel the impact of social and political opposition. They would not feel welcome or safe in the state. UND doctoral student, Dan Walinsky was quoted in the Grand Forks Herald stating, “to move from a place where I am protected to a place where I am no longer protected is terrifying” (Nadeau, 2009b). The University attracted students from all across the nation and some came from states that had legal protections for LGBTQ+ people like that of Walinksy. Without protections, students at UND and new citizens felt vulnerable and feared what could happen to them if people became aware of their identity. The impact was a lack of community, increases in mental health concerns, and fear of safety.   According to the Grand Forks Herald, on February 18, 2009, the North Dakota Senate passed ND Senate Bill 2278, a bill that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing, employment, credit transaction, and use of public accommodation (News, 2009). Although there was success in the State Senate, the House voted against the bill which was a crushing defeat for the LGBTQ+ community in North Dakota. As the new decade rushed 79  in, the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the state would continue with greater visibility and representation.   A Threat to Conservativism   On March 12, 2012 the Grand Forks Herald published an article about Joshua Boschee, a Fargo resident, who submitted paperwork at the Cass Count Auditor’s Office in Fargo, North Dakota to become the first openly gay candidate for a legislative seat in the state (News, 2012a). Boschee was an advocate for gay rights and used that as part of his campaign platform. In addition to Boschee’s announcement of running for a legislative seat in the North Dakota House of Representatives, Michel Lindemann, also an openly gay man, announced he was running for a legislative seat as well. Lindemann stated in regard to his announcement as well as Boshee’s, “if either of us wins, we will be the first openly gay member elected to the Legislature” (News, 2012a).  In the 2012 state election, Boschee made history as the first openly gay state representative in the North Dakota Legislature. In an interview with Valley News Live, Boschee states after his win, “I think it shows LGBT kids in the state that if you work hard, and you are true to yourself, anything is possible. And I had this opportunity, and with a lot of help, it paid off” (Valley News Live, 2012). This was a significant win in the state, and not just because Boschee made history, but it demonstrated how the LGBTQ+ community in the state was resilient. This was the first time the state had LGBTQ+ representation in its political body, and the election showed that voters were committed to helping advocate for LGBTQ+ rights by electing Boschee. This was needed as the state’s legislative history had demonstrated it was anti-LGBTQ+ and now there was a decision-maker on the front lines to challenge the norms of the legislative body.  80  The Power of Local Activism   On February 14, 2013, the Grand Forks Herald reported how the North Dakota Senate failed to pass Senate Bill 2252, a bill that would have added sexual orientation to the state’s discrimination statute by creating protections for LGBTQ+ people from housing and employment discrimination (Jerke, 2013). The news was disappointing to those in Grand Forks as days earlier, the City Council passed a resolution in support of the bill. After Senate Bill 2252 had failed, the Grand Forks City Council heard arguments over the idea of passing a local ordinance to protect LGBTQ+ people with housing and employment. One of the voices present at the February 19, 2013 council meeting was UND student body president Logan Fletcher, also an openly gay student. The Grand Forks Herald interviewed Fletcher to capture his thoughts on the ordinance. Fletcher expressed how discrimination is a problem in Grand Forks, and it made him reconsider the possibility of continuing his education at UND. Fletcher states, “it is somewhere I could not return to after my graduation...Protect people like me who have contributed to my community” (Bjorke, 2013). The Ten Percent Society decided to act and collaborated with the Grand Forks City Council to create the city ordinance that would protect LGBTQ+ citizens.   The following months would result in debate and question the rights of LGBTQ+ people in Grand Forks. Testimonies of their experiences in the community weighed heavily on the city council and citizens of Grand Forks as the city ordinance was developed. Simultaneously, the Grand Forks City Council explored ways to protect city employees from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. On June 17, 2013, city council approved an amendment to city law that protects city employees from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation and became the first city in North Dakota to have protection in city law.   81  The fight for LGBTQ+ rights in Grand Forks continued with great momentum after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision United States v. Windsor (2013) that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, and an act that refused to recognize same-sex marriages in 1996. Over the next few months, the city would advocate for the passing of the LGBTQ+ city protections when the state had failed. On September 23, 2013, UND students, faculty, and staff joined Grand Forks community members to listen and speak about the proposed city ordinance that would ban housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Jacob Thomas, a Ten Percent Society member, was interviewed by the Dakota Student. He states, “Grand Forks would be the first city in the state to pass such a ordinance” (Sandstrom, 2013). On October 7, 2013, Grand Forks did just that, and city council passed the ordinance becoming the first city in North Dakota to ban housing discrimination based on sexual orientation according to the Grand Forks Herald (News, 2013).   The passing of the city ordinance and employment protection amendment was significant as it demonstrated how local grassroots efforts led to effective change. More significant was how the Ten Percent Society was part of that narrative and showed the power of advocacy work by LGBTQ+ people for LGBTQ+ people. The Ten Percent Society maintained its role in history as a change-maker defied the odds and continued to have a lasting impact on LGBTQ+ people in the state.   A Commitment to LGBTQ+ Students  2015 started with hope as the North Dakota Senate passed Senate Bill 2279, a bill that would have protected LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in housing, employment, and public accommodations. However, the bill was short lived as the members of the House failed to pass the bill (Nowatzki, 2015). As North Dakota was demonstrated its consistent opposition towards 82  the LGBTQ+ community, the nation watched as marriage equality was debated in the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 26, 2015, in the landmark case Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that marriage is a fundamental right to same-sex couples and required that all U.S. states and territories recognize same-sex marriage. This was a major win in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights.   In Grand Forks, community leader Kyle Thorson took initiative to organize Grand Forks Pride and Thorson told the Grand Forks Herald, “the time felt right” following the U.S Supreme Court’s ruling on marriage equality (Burleson, 2015). The community event was a two-day festival consisting of a drag show, color run, free movies, comedy acts, and yard games. Charles Vondal, a Grand Forks local and high school student at Central High, recalls his involvement with the Ten Percent Society during Grand Forks Pride and recounts involvement with tabling for the organization and remembering that overall, it was a celebratory day. Vondal joined the Ten Percent Society while attending high school as the organization was open to both UND students and community members. Vondal actively sought out community and engaged in various forms of activism; one joining the Ten Percent Society was the perfect opportunity to get involved with the local community. Vondal was no stranger to engaging in activism work. Just months prior, Vondal challenged norms in high school by walking in the prom grand march with his same-gender partner. The act of defying traditional norms caught the attention of the Grand Forks Herald and Vondal was outed to the paper’s readers (Richie, 2015). Vondal knew there would be risks but hoped that by being visible, more people would feel comfortable expressing themselves.   Assault on Campus  83  Although it may have felt like there was a shift in attitude and perceptions of the LGBTQ+ people, occurrences of hate and discrimination were still prevalent. Vondal recalls an incident where a gay man was assaulted at a UND fraternity party. Vondal states, “I was still in high school and remember the news that a gay man was assaulted at a fraternity house, there was a Grand Forks Herald article, and everyone was talking about it” (C. Vondal, personal communication, April 12, 2022). The Grand Forks Herald wrote about the assault that had occurred on August 30, 2015. In the article, UND sergeant Danny Weigel states, “we were informed by the victim that people with the assault had made comments regarding sexual orientation” (Laughlin, 2015). Students interviewed were skeptical about what had occurred. The Grand Forks Herald captured statements such as: “I’m just surprised and I feel there’s more to the story,” “It just does not sound like something that would happen,” and “I guess I really cannot believe that, but if it is true, that is crazy” (Laughlin, 2015).   The students’ responses attribute to the perception that LGBTQ+ people were not targeted because of their identity and reported violence was unlikely to occur. Was this in defense of the fraternity or were perceptions a result of ongoing social opposition that had been engrained in the community? Haakon Gisvold, the individual who made the report, told the Grand Forks Herald that during the altercation he was choked, stripped of his clothing, and hit with his own belt while being called anti-gay slurs (Volpenheim, 2015a). Initially, Gisvold did not want to go to the police but was urged to do so, and he stated, “my father told me, ‘Do you want this to happen to anybody else?’ and I said, absolutely not” (Volpenheim, 2015a). UND President Robert Kelley released a statement to the campus community. The message was published in the Bismarck Tribune UND says:  84  This is a matter that concerns me deeply. I want to be very clear: violent behavior of this nature is not tolerated at UND. Any student or student organization found to have violated the UND Code of Student Life will be subject to disciplinary action. No decision will be made until investigations are completed. (Forum News Service, 2015)  The president’s message demonstrated a commitment to address this kind of behavior if the investigation process warranted such an outcome. However, in the weeks to come, a report on the incident would conclude the case yielding an undesirable outcome.   On October 8, 2015, the Grand Forks County State’s Attorney Office issued a news release that determined the incident was a falsification of information and indicated that Grisvold was not assaulted, but instead, he had started the fight (Volpenheim, 2015b). According to the Grand Forks Herald, the police summary noted Gisvold expressed he had no reason to lie and did not make up the allegations, and he just wanted the ordeal to go away (Volpenheim, 2015b). This situation was very problematic as incidents of hate regularly occurred against the LGBTQ+ community, and when cases such as this happen, it diminishes the reality of the situation. The fraternity in question was on the defense throughout the case, and it was never a question or recognition that such an incident could even exist. Fraternity member Patrick Sewich tells the Dakota Student, “it is said that you are innocent until proven guilty, but right now, it definitely feels like we are guilty until we are proven innocent” (Cleary, 2015). The conversations did not focus on how something like this could have been prevented or that LGBTQ+ violence occurs. Since the beginning of the reports, students questioned the reality that LGBTQ+ violence would even happen on UND’s campus. Would the narrative have changed if the allegations were proven to be true? There was a growing concern among LGBTQ+ students on campus regarding safety and support, and it was time for the institution to finally to commit to LGBTQ+ students.   85  Creating LGBTQ+ Support Services  Since the establishment of the Ten Percent Society, the organization held the sole responsibility on campus for supporting and providing resources for LGBTQ+ students. Drag shows would help raise funds for the organization but it was not enough to truly provide support for the community. In 2016, the Ten Percent Society asked that UND fund an LGBTQ+ center for students. Tieg Paulson, president of the Ten Percent Society, articulates his frustrations with the university to the Grand Forks Herald:  We have been advocating for a center for at least ten years now. It is not just for us but for the people we represent. But the answer from the administration has always been ‘we do not have the funds,’ which is more prevalent this year. (Streetman, 2016)   The Grand Forks Herald reported that at an April 19th meeting of the UND Student Fee Advisory Committee, a request of $62,000 was made to hire an LGBTQ+ coordinator that would operate within Multicultural Student Services, but the request was denied. Student body president Matt Kopp commented that the committee denied the creation of the position because of the ongoing budget cuts that were occurring. Kopp states, “we were not considering new positions. Those interested in creating the coordinator position will be able to make another request next fall (Streetman, 2016).   The news was disappointing for students. Paulson shares his frustrations with the decision:  The LGBT center would be akin to UND-funded organizations like the UND Indian Association and the Women’s Center...We are more tolerable this year because of the budget cuts, but we are really looking for any kind of commitment from the administration...absolutely anything. (Streetman, 2016)   86  Ten Percent Society faculty adviser Cheryl Terrance wrote an email to the Grand Forks Herald stressing the burden that had been placed on the organization:  Having served as the faculty adviser for this group for ten years, this has obviously demanded/placed a lot of work on a group that is run by students-LGBT programming (i.e., earlier this year we brought in Shane Britney Crone and showed his story “Bridegroom”), ally training/support, LGBT support, etc., is supported solely by this organization. (Streetman, 2016)  The Ten Percent Society held high expectations from UND administration to make a difference on campus for LGBTQ+ students. As articulated by the president and adviser, the organization had been asking for a commitment from the institution for the past decade, and the time was now to take action. Paulson states, “We just really want to stress that we are willing to work with the administration to get something done” (Streetman, 2016).  The contested use of student fees to support LGBTQ+ students was not a new conversation for the university. Chapter III narrates an incident where the LGBTQ+ organization brought two speakers to UND to talk about LGBTQ+ marriage equality which caused an uproar on campus because student fees were used to cover the costs of the event. There was a disconnect between the purpose of student fees and who actually gets to benefit from them. The use of student fees at UND by LGBTQ+ students remained a constant challenge as students would pay the fees but would not be able to access them to receive adequate support services. Social Justice Living Learning Community  Although the students felt defeated over the denial to create an LGBTQ+ center, they found a sliver of hope with the opening of the Social Justice Living Learning Community within UND Housing. The community opened at the start of the fall 2016 semester for students that 87  held common interests in promoting and practicing social equality. One unique factor of the community was that students who chose to live in it had an option to select a gender inclusive room assignment. This was significant for supporting transgender and gender-diverse students as it would allow for a room assignment were students could feel safe and validated with their identity. A Dakota Student article reports that the creation of the community was a result of conversations within the residence halls and an effort from hall government who passed a resolution to create the community (Johnson, 2016).   Charles Vondal, now a first-year student at UND, lived in the community. Vondal sought out the community for its values and commitment to LGBTQ+ inclusion. Vondal recalled, “I remember the Social Justice LLC getting a bad rap in the conservative newspapers, something about calling us snowflakes” (C. Vondal, personal communication, April 12, 2022).  The negative response to the community did not deter Vondal away although there were other instances that occurred in the community. Vondal states, “there was a bulletin board about LGBTQ+ history month in October that was slashed during the day” (C. Vondal, personal communication, April 12, 2022). Vondal believes that the damage to the bulletin board was a result of LGBTQ+ opposition that remained on campus. This was an isolated incident, and overall, the living learning community provided a university service to LGBTQ+ students where no others existed.  The Pride Center Opens  During the fall 2016 semester, interviews were conducted to hire a LGBTQ+ director for the UND Pride Center that would open in Spring 2017. UND became the first higher education institution in the state of North Dakota to create a physical space on campus for LGBTQ+ students in addition to a full-time position with responsibilities dedicated to supporting LGBTQ+ 88  students and living up to its name as the state’s flagship university. The Pride Center offers students a physical space to find community and support. The director, Chris Schlarb, addressed some of the challenges that were expected in the role to the Dakota Student:  There is a lot of attrition factors when it comes to the LGBTQ community...there is a lot of health factors and challenges that students experience, and I think that had a lot to do with the lack of visibility and support for this community in North Dakota. (Hatlen, 2017)  Schlarb’s assumptions about the LGBTQ+ community at UND were attributed to what the Ten Percent Society had been advocating for over the past forty years. The Pride Center creation was also timely as the North Dakota Legislature failed to pass House Bill 1386 which would have protected LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. The Grand Forks Herald released an article featuring stories from two transgender women on how the bill’s passing would have created much needed protections for them and their employment. Theresa Marshall, one of the individuals featured and the founder of Gender Friendly Grand Forks, a local advocacy group for transgender residents, expresses how she believed the presidential election increased safety concerns as the candidate had emboldened opponents of the LGBTQ+ community (Easter, 2017). The bill would have provided protections during such an unprecedented time in the nation.   A Commitment to Students  Vondal expresses how the creation of the Pride Center had an unexpected impact on the Ten Percent Society. Vondal states, “member attendance was a big issue. It was hard trying to get members involved. We have Pride Center now, so what was the purpose of the Ten Percent Society” (C. Vondal, personal communication, April 12, 2022). The hiring of the full-time staff 89  member for LGBTQ+ programs and services lessened the burden and responsibility of the Ten Percent society to be the sole resource and support for LGBTQ+ students. This shift impacted the purpose and intent of the organization as much of its focus was on advocating for support resources on campus. Vondal also explains that LGBTQ+ people felt defeated after House Bill 1386 failed to pass in the state in 2017. The bill would have created protections for LGBTQ+ people from discrimination in employment and housing. Vondal believes that the failed bill may have played a role in the decreasing membership of the Ten Percent Society as students were losing hope in the state’s ability to protect LGBTQ+ people.    By 2018, the Ten Percent Society primarily consisted of only executive officers as membership had rapidly declined. Vondal remained involved in the organization but had taken a more active role in the Grand Forks drag community. Vondal states, “drag for me helps express my views on gender norms and gender expression. Drag shows are where I met most of my family, it is a community” (C. Vondal, personal communication, April 12, 2022). The drag community serves as a safe place to be authentic and find connections in a social setting, similarly to that of the gay dances in the 1970s and 1980s. Other LGBTQ+ students may have found similar connections outside of the organization, like Vondal. The Ten Percent Society was now in a time of rebuilding and finding a new purpose. Additionally, UND was also in a period of restructuring as it redefined its role in supporting diverse students.   On February 26, 2018, the Dakota Student released an article regarding the University’s plan for diversity. The article was an interview with the dean of students and vice president of student affairs Cara Halgren and highlighted within the article were the challenges with diversity at the university (Washington, 2018). One concern was UND had not filled the vacant position of the associate vice president of diversity and inclusion, and the article notes that the prior 90  individual in the position had resigned due to an incompatible vision for UND diversity. In addition to the vacant position, the Women’s Center did not have any staff. Halgren was quoted in the article as saying, “budget cuts and buyouts happened and there was not a success plan for the Women’s Center but we are working on it” (Washington, 2018). The Pride Center director had also left their position. Halgren stated in response to the director leaving, “some people just are not a fit here at UND” (Washington, 2018).   These actions and statements demonstrated the institutional priority of student support services that focused on historically excluded and marginalized people. After decades of advocating for institutional change to support LGBTQ+ students and having success, evidence showed that support was only given in name and not in practice. UND would continue into the next few years developing alternatives to address the gaps in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives on campus and attempting to compete with peer institutions and trends in higher education where support services had already been established for decades prior.   Chapter Summary Challenges with supporting LGBTQ+ students at UND reflect that of the state’s political landscape. The legislative history demonstrats how conservative state politics continued to oppose LGBTQ+ people despite the advancement across the nation with historic U.S. Supreme Court rulings for LGBTQ+ rights. The Ten Percent Society may have helped influence local change with the passing of protections through city ordinances and the advocacy work in establishing a Pride Center on campus, but they had met a new challenge with finding purpose for their existence as membership dwindled. As the nation grappled with a global pandemic in 2020, amidst growing anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, the UND would be challenged in defending its commitment to LGBTQ+ students. 91  This chapter explores how the Ten Percent Society engaged in activism through protest, and then with state politics by influencing the creation of grassroots organizations to combat oppressive legislation and social opposition across the state. LGBTQ+ students acted on their own behalf when institutional leaders, state legislators, and local leaders would not have otherwise. The advocacy work of the Ten Percent Society demonstrates how students had changed their purpose in the 2000s to move past community gathering and creating visibility to have an LGBTQ+ presence at UND, but the instead engaged in activism to demand equal rights and hold the university accountable for its commitment to actively supporting LGBTQ+ students. For more than three decades, LGBTQ+ students had to balance their academics, their overall well-being, and the everyday life of a college student while needing to advocate for themselves in the absence of institutional policy and state legislative protections. This chapter articulates how LGBTQ+ students were ready to take a stance and pressure the university into setting the standard for LGBTQ+ equality in higher education across the state. 92  CHAPTER V CONCLUSION  This dissertation tells the queer history of the University of North Dakota from the 1980s to the present day by arguing how LGBTQ+ students carried the burden of responsibility in creating support structures and resources. LGBTQ+ student activism led to the development of LGBTQ+ programs and services in a socially and politically conservative state. Over the course of forty years, the Ten Percent Society demonstrates the power of activism to create effective change in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights on campus, in the Grand Forks community and across the state of North Dakota.  This dissertation explores two points of interest. The first was the name changes of the LGBTQ+ organization that occurred throughout the decades. This history tells a narrative of how the organization adjusted its name to reflect its purpose and evolving language in LGBTQ+ terminology. This was an important factor to address in the organization’s history as the name impacted how LGBTQ+ students viewed themselves on campus throughout time. The second was how student activism shifted to align with national and state influences that impacted LGBTQ+ people. Each chapter represents a time where LGBTQ+ students had shaped their experience to address the concerns and issues in society. Chapter II begins with the origin story of the LGBTQ+ student group in the 1980s and addresses how the AIDS epidemic increased social opposition towards LGBTQ+ people and how the community provided sexual health education resources when UND did not. 93   Chapter III explores that greater resistance was required by LGBTQ+ students throughout the 1990s as acts of hate and systemic discrimination was increasing. The 1990s shifted the organization to move beyond campus visibility to campus activism as LGBTQ+ students experienced discrimination on campus and were left to navigate the challenges and issues they faced on their own with limited support from university faculty and staff. Chapter IV articulates how local, state, and national policy drove LGBTQ+ students to shift their focus from campus to centering on North Dakota legislation. In the 2000s, the state’s legislative history demonstrates an ongoing opposition towards LGBTQ+ people as bills that would promote inclusion were never passed. This ignited LGBTQ+ student activism to support writing state legislation, impacting city ordinances, and pressuring UND to take an active role in its commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ students through the creation of the Pride Center.  This chapter discusses the relevant history from 1980 to present day that was explored in this dissertation by focusing on the current climate of LGBTQ+ students at the University. In this chapter, Charles Vondal, an undergraduate student at UND, provides insight in into how the Ten Percent Society evolved out of necessity to advocate for and protect LGBTQ+ students as the University grappled with its commitment for inclusion in the late 2010s. Additionally, this chapter offers practical implications for student services, administrative leadership, and contributions to scholarship in the study of LGBTQ+ college student activism.   Relevance of History  In 1982, when LGBTQ+ students at UND gathered to register as the UND Gay Community, they created a foundation for future generations to build from to advance LGBTQ+ inclusion at the University and across North Dakota as the first LGBTQ+ rights organization in the state. Chapter II explores how the early organizing of LGBTQ+ students at UND came out of 94  necessity as they did not have institutional support services. The organization served as a community support resource to build a sense of belonging and solidarity as the AIDS epidemic increased social opposition towards LGBTQ+ people. Oral history interviews with Janell Holter and Paul Traynor capture how the organization had to rebuild in 1985 and take on the role of educating the campus community about LGBTQ+ people and AIDS. They articulate the burden placed on students to become the educator and provider of support resources in place of the university which had no intent in the 1980s with supporting LGBTQ+ students.   By the 1990s, LGBTQ+ students were well organized and engaged in activism as explored in Chapter III. LGBTQ+ visibility was an important factor for building awareness and engaging in advocacy work to address LGBTQ+ issues on campus. Historian John D’Emilio (2013) articulates how harassment, violence, and other hate-motivated acts against lesbians and gay men had surfaced at alarming rates on campuses across the country. This was a result of greater visibility that was a necessity but came with risk. D’Emilio expresses that unlike other identity groups, such as women or African Americans, which one’s identity is clear to see, gay men and lesbian women had the option to remain invisible. Archival data from the 1990s in the student newspaper, the Dakota Student, narrates how LGBTQ+ issues were at the forefront of conversations as acts of hatred towards the community was increasing. LGBTQ+ students took a risk and became visible to enact campus change. Anti-LGBTQ+ messaging and opposition for LGBTQ+ campus activities was growing alongside national discrimination as the United States passed laws against LGBTQ+ military service in 1994 and marriage equality in 1996. Oral history interviews with Keith Malaterre, Darin Buri, and Chris Stoner, in addition to Dakota Student articles, articulate the campus climate and the challenges that LGBTQ+ students faced throughout the 1990s. Historian Patrick Dilley (2019) writes on the experiences of LGBTQ+ 95  students at universities and narrates that in the 1990s, many historically marginalized student groups banded together to address concerns of campus inclusion, access and support. Additionally, Dilly states that by the 1990s more Midwester state universities became more accepting campuses for non-discriminatory practices and equal opportunities; efforts were slow but were led by cohorts of LGBTQ+ student activists. Historical scholarship from the 1990s demonstrates how LGBTQ+ student activism made a significant impact on campus policy, but at UND, efforts were moving even slower as national opposition greatly influenced state and social opposition of LGBTQ+ people in North Dakota.  Stoner’s interview highlights how the Ten Percent Society remained the campus educator for LGBTQ+ issues and continued to provide support resources as campus administrators lacked the knowledge and understanding about how to serve LGBTQ+ students. The narrative of the Ten Percent Society burdened with creating their own support services and resources for LGBTQ+ students continued into the twenty-first century as other universities across the Midwest and nation were making advances in their efforts to include and support them. The disconnect from what occurred nationally and regionally in higher education shows that UND as an institution was isolated and relied on the state and institutional stakeholders to influence decision making to support students at the intersections of their identities. Chapter IV addresses how conservative state politics in the 2000s called for greater activism work by the Ten Percent Society. Oral history interviews with Malaterre, Buri, and Stoner demonstrate how the Ten Percent Society began to build a coalition on campus, throughout the city, and the state as they combatted discriminatory organizations, such as the Westboro Baptist Church, and challenged the North Dakota legislature. They had moved beyond advocacy work at UND to engagement in state-level policies to impact greater change for 96  LGBTQ+ people. Although they experienced great legislative losses, the Ten Percent Society’s local activism led to effective change in local ordinances to protect LGBTQ+ people in the city of Grand Forks. Pressure by the Ten Percent Society towards UND administrators would lead to the development of LGBTQ+ programs and services in 2017-three decades after the formation of the UND Gay Community.   This history tells a story of how LGBTQ+ support services at UND were developed, the creation of state-wide human rights organizations, and how local laws were shaped by LGBTQ+ students engaging in activism. On-campus LGBTQ+ awareness, education, and advocacy was conducted by students with minimal support from faculty and staff. It would take over three decades for UND to demonstrate a commitment to LGBTQ+ students. This history demonstrates how LGBTQ+ students continued to be the voice for their own safety and well-being on campus instead of the University taking a proactive approach to creating support structures. The creation of the Pride Center in 2017 would come forty-six years after the opening of the first campus-based LGBTQ+ center at the University of Michigan in 1971. Additionally, after the murder of University of Wyoming college student Matthew Shepard in 1998, the nation saw an immediate rise in the number of universities that created LGBTQ+ centers (Fink, 2012), and it would not be until another nineteen years before UND opened the Pride Center. The delay in the development of LGBTQ+ support programs and services at UND highlights the long-standing challenge of showing a commitment to LGBTQ+ students.   North Dakota History Repeats Itself  In June 2020, the Ten Percent Society changed its name to the UND Queer and Trans Alliance. Vondal stepped into the president role of the organization to fill a void in leadership and thought that a name change could help with increasing membership. Vondal expresses that 97  the name Ten Percent Society was used because of Alfred Kinsey’s study in the 1940s that stated ten percent of the population was gay. However, Vondal feels that the name did not accurately reflect society’s LGBTQ+ population and was potentially confusing to new members as “LGBTQ+” was not reflected anywhere in the title. The new name, UND Queer and Trans Alliance, was viewed as more inclusive to all LGBTQ+ identities and more recognizable on campus to new students.   The name change was reflective of the ongoing challenges with LGBTQ+ inclusion in the state. Throughout the organization’s history, its name had changed multiple times to represent its members identities and evolving language specific to the LGBTQ+ community. Greater inclusion in representation by the organization was necessary as the state engaged with anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and external forces that threatened progress in LGBTQ+ inclusion. A renaming allowed the UND Queer and Trans Alliance to unite LGBTQ+ members across UND’s campus and create solidarity to address growing concerns of anti-legislation and oppressive forces impacting policy at the University.  Anti-LGBTQ+ Rhetoric In July 2020, the North Dakota Republican Party voted in a series of anti-LGBTQ+ statements that delegates approved as part of the party’s platform. The final line of the resolution states it, “opposes the passage of legislation which adds sexual orientation and gender identity to our century code as protected classes” (Turley, 2020). The statement expresses the continual opposition towards LGBTQ+ people by the state’s conservative legislative majority and the influence state politics held on the ability for equal rights bills to pass. Additionally, another statement alluded to rhetoric that was often expressed in the 1980s and 1990s during the AIDS epidemic. The resolution states, “many LGBT practices are unhealthy and dangerous, sometimes 98  endangering or shortening life and sometimes infecting society at large” (Turley, 2020). Almost forty years after the start of the AIDS epidemic in the nation, state legislators continue to use AIDS stigma and discriminatory behaviors to express their outward political opposition towards LGBTQ+ people.  Anti-Transgender Legislation  The name change was also important as it helped further articulate the purpose of the Queer and Trans Alliance’s role in advocating for LGBTQ+ people, and more specifically transgender, non-binary, and gender diverse students. In 2021, there was a national shift in LGBTQ+ politics to specifically target transgender people. A series of anti-trans bills were introduced, and one included House Bill 1298 in North Dakota. This bill targeted transgender student athletes and if passed, it would prohibit transgender women from playing in women’s sports. In an interview with the Grand Forks Herald, Vondal spoke on behalf of the Queer & Trans Alliance to advocate for transgender students. Vondal spoke against the bill states, “it felt to me like they are trying to push a different agenda than trying to protect women’s sports” (Shirley, 2021).   North Dakota’s legislative history shows a lack of support for LGBTQ+ people in the state by failing to pass bills that would have given protection. However, House Bill 1298 was different as it was targeted to actively discriminate against transgender people in the state. The bill was passed in both the House and Senate which was a devastating blow to the LGBTQ+ community. However, Republican Governor Doug Burgum vetoed the bill on April 21, 2022. The House aimed to override the veto and met the two-thirds majority vote to override, but the vote was not reached in the Senate. The Dickinson Press published an article with a quote from Governor Burgum. He states, “North Dakota today has a level playing field and fairness in girls’ 99  sports...we have every confidence that they will continue to ensure a level playing field for the 27,000 students who participate in North Dakota high school sports” (Willis, 2021). For the first time in North Dakota history, a governor had sided in opposition of the conservative majority to protect LGBTQ+ people in the state.   UND’s Gender Inclusion Policy   In April 2021, a conversation was initiated between the UND Equal Opportunity & Title IX Office and Student Diversity & Inclusion to implement a gender inclusion policy at UND. The purpose of the policy was to expand on the non-discrimination policy that already included protections on the basis of gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation to further include protections for transgender, non-binary, and gender diverse students. The gender inclusion policy was drafted to create guidelines for pronouns and chosen name use in campus systems and communication but also created an expectation for gender inclusion in all aspects of campus life. The timing was a key factor in the policy’s development as there was more support on campus for LGBTQ+ inclusion with a new university president and greater campus engagement in LGBTQ+ initiatives. Additionally, work within the North Dakota University System (NDUS) was occurring with a policy for chosen name and pronouns used across the NDUS system.   Developing the gender inclusion policy required an all-campus effort as staff from Student Diversity & Inclusion, Equal Opportunity & Title IX, Human Resources, Housing, Facilities, Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, Registrar’s Office, and Admissions engaged in the process. By November 2021, the policy had been approved by the UND administration and was available for public comment as part of the policy implementation process. This time, there was hope that the policy would demonstrate the institution’s commitment to LGBTQ+ students, faculty, and staff.      100  However, on January 10, 2022, the North Dakota Catholic Conference released an open letter rejecting the gender inclusion policy drafted at UND. In this letter, Christopher Dodson, executive director and general counsel of the North Dakota Catholic Conference, addresses his concerns with the policy. Dodson articulates the following in the letter:  We recognize that everyone should be treated with respect and that the university has a role in facilitating a respectful learning environment. However, this proposal goes beyond setting mere rules for administrative tasks. Indeed, it embraces and demands acceptance of a particular ideology about gender and language that is contrary to Catholic teaching and infringes upon free speech and religious rights. The proposed policy even requires student organizations to use preferred pronouns, accept expressed genders, and reject binary understandings of gender even if doing so conflicted with their sincerely held religious beliefs. (Dodson, 2022)  Shortly after Dodson’s letter, the mayor of Grand Forks, Brandon Bochenski weighs in via his Facebook page. The mayor warns, “compelling speech and forcing an ideology on our students, our children, and our community is abhorrent” (B. Bochenski, personal communication, January 13, 2022). Across the state, parents and policymakers reached out to university officials and demanded the policy be abandoned. Far from a new moment, the intersection of student activism around LGBTQ+ rights and community opposition to those efforts animate fundamental historical tension that continues at the University and in North Dakota, a state with a long history of conservative politics influenced by religious ideologies for decades.  On campus, UND President Andrew Armacost held a press conference where he defended the gender inclusion policy on January 14, 2022. Armacost states, “I have an unwavering commitment to ensure each and every human being on our campus is treated with 101  dignity and respect and is afforded protections under the law” (Kurtz, 2022a). The press conference served as an opportunity to provide clarity and understanding for the policy but also demonstrated the challenges that public opinion, external stakeholders, and historical social opposition towards LGBTQ+ people held in the development of institutional policy and decision making. The press conference was necessary to appease external forces that demonstrated opposition towards UND’s development of the proposed policy and further demonstrating the role and position of the university.  Regarding the next steps with the policy, Armacost states, “I would anticipate that to take a process of months, and we’re in no hurry. I know the public is now watching us very carefully, but I think we need to make sure that we get this right” (Kurtz, 2022a). The Tuesday following Armacost’s press conference, Grand Forks City Council held its regular meeting. At the meeting, UND students and community members had an opportunity to express their disappointment and concerns with statements made by Mayor Bochenski’s social media post opposing the gender inclusion policy. UND Queer and Trans Alliance had representation at the council meeting from their president and members of the organization and shared how hurt they felt after the mayor’s comments. After listening to each individual, Mayor Bochenski offered an apology for his actions. He explains, “undoubtedly my words were unduly harsh. I apologize for that. I am glad to be able to sit here tonight and list and learn” (Van Dyke, 2022).   Responses from President Armacost and Mayor Bochenski’s gave hope to the UND community in moving forward with the implementation of the gender inclusion policy. However, on January 21, 2022, President Armacost made the decision to discontinue work on the policy. President Armacost articulated the challenges of balancing freedom of speech, religious exercise, and expression but also existing non-discrimination policies at UND that offered protections on 102  the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. The Grand Forks Herald expressed how Armacost made his decision after hearing feedback on the policy from groups, both on campus and off but also that he informed members of the State Board of Higher Education, legislators, and alumni of the decision to cease work on the policy (Kurtz, 2022b). This justification may be a result of greater external forces at play that forced Armacost to make a decision to appease those demonstrating opposition that have a profound influence over UND’s inner workings.  Ultimately, UND is not on an island; the conservative politics that shape the state also shape campus decisions. UND’s queer history explored in this dissertation is important for understanding how decisions on campus policy regarding inclusion and equity are made. Contemporary issues show the conflict the University endures by trying to be progressive in its policies, support, and actions but is met with resistance from external forces that have maintained a presence of social opposition towards LGBTQ+ throughout North Dakota history.  Queer Resistance and Student Activism The incidents leading up to the dismissal of the gender inclusion policy at the UND in 2022 were not isolated occurrences but instead the latest chapter in a much longer story. LGBTQ+ students at UND did not organize in the 1980s simply as means to socialize. Rather, it was an act of resistance and one that took a stance against social norms. AIDS education was a necessity to fight the stigma against the LGBTQ+ community. Grassroots efforts to combat AIDS were effective for building a community that would engage in activism at the state level for LGBTQ+ rights. The LGBTQ+ student organization remained resilient in advocacy for sexual health education in the 1980s and 1990s while receiving threats and protests from religious organizations. These efforts not only broke AIDS stigma but also may have saved lives as no other form of education was available to college students on campus. Providing space and 103  educating LGBTQ+ students about HIV/AIDS broke barriers and helped people feel supported when society shamed them. Organizing efforts to combat a global health problem that coincided with harassment and discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community helped the LGBTQ+ organization’s students realize they had a voice, they were resilient, and could engage in activism work for LGBTQ+ rights.  UND’s LGBTQ+ history tells a story of how LGBTQ+ students had to pave the way for support services and resources. Students did not wait for institutional policy or educational opportunities provided by UND; they had to take charge. Since the 1980s, the organization had to fundraise to cover the costs of dances that were held off-campus, a crucial part of LGBTQ+ social history (Dilly, 2002). Educational panels, LGBTQ+ speaking events, and information tabling were led by students trying to build awareness, understanding, and community when UND administrators looked the other way. As national and state legislation negatively impacted the lives of LGBTQ+ people, students were forced into activism work. They were targeted and harassed on campus and left to defend themselves when administrators failed to understand discrimination against LGBTQ+ students. Growing opposition and the lack of institutional support services went hand and hand, and responsibility fell to the students to seek out community resources or develop their own network to address concerns. Writing legislation to enact local and stage change was crucial as LGBTQ+ students were not finding support at the University. Advocating for LGBTQ+ inclusive legislation and city protections was how students could impact cultural change at UND.  Although LGBTQ+ students experienced many forms of resistance, and the cycle of activism has continued throughout the decades. John D’Emilio (2013) explains how queer activism follows a cycle of “moments of leaping ahead” and “longer stretches of creeping 104  along.” This is the narrative of activism at the UND from early organization involvement in the 1980s through the 1990s and 2000s and moments of success, grand defeats, and opportunities that provide hope. Contribution to Historical Scholarship   This dissertation contributes to the historical literature on LGBTQ+ student activism on college campuses through the framework of queer theory. Few scholars have specifically addressed queer history in higher education and use queer theory to inform their work. Situated in the northern plains of rural Midwest America, UND provides a unique historical understanding of how conservativism continues to influence institutional leaders and the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. Patrick Dilly (2019), in Gay Liberation to Campus Assimilation: Early Non-Heterosexual Student Organzing at Midwestern Universities writes about activities and foundations of LGBTQ+ student organizations in the mid-1970s to early 1990s and articulates how their efforts were less revolutionary and more assimilationist than in the previous decade. Dilly argues that gay and lesbian groups primarily focused on outreach initiatives to build a campus presence. The intent was to build campus awareness and understanding of LGBTQ+ people, issues, and politics. Dilly expresses that through awareness, the campus communities developed an understanding that would lead to developing strategies in changing campus policies to include LGBTQ+ people. At UND, LGBTQ+ students engaged in similar tactics almost a decade later than the Midwestern universities studied by Dilly. UND students engaged in outreach in the mid to late 1980s and would establish a visible presence on campus in the early 1990s that promoted greater visibility and awareness on LGBTQ+ issues. It would not be until the 2000s when LGBTQ+ students would develop strategies to engage in greater activism to 105  change campus policies and pressure the institution in developing institutional programs and support initiatives.  This dissertation expands on Dilly’s work by situating UND outside the narrative of Midwestern universities where LGBTQ+ students primarily engaged with inclusion efforts that were found to be successful. UND’s history is more complex as LGBTQ+ students were trailblazers for creating the first LGBTQ+ rights organization in North Dakota and advocated for the development of the first state institution of higher education to create a physical space dedicated to LGBTQ+ students. It was also the first in the state to also hire a full-time professional whose primary responsibility is to serving LGBTQ+ students. Additionally, UND’s history contributes to the growing scholarship in regional-based studies on LGBTQ+ activism. Timothy Cain and Michael Hevel (2021) contribute to LGBTQ+ history through their studies on the legal victories and legacy of the Committee on Gay Education (CGE) at the University of Georgia. The CGE’s lawsuits allowed LGBTQ+ groups in the southern United States to become official organizations and hold public gay dances. Cain and Hevel express that the CGE may have been the first LGBTQ+ student organization to become an official campus organization in the South.  Other scholarly works in LGBTQ higher education history situate themselves on prestigious universities in the north with exceptions to Dilly’s work in the Midwest and Jessica Clawson’s study on LGBTQ+ student visibility at public universities in Florida. This dissertation adds to the collection’s “firsts” in LGBTQ+ historical scholarship centering on UND as being uniquely situated and deviating from the traditional timeline in the LGBTQ+ rights movement on college campuses. The Role of Higher Education 106  As cultural change occurs, driven by LGBTQ+ student activism, conservative leadership and external forces remind the university of where it exists and whom it is destined to serve. The history demonstrates an ongoing lack of commitment to LGBTQ+ students and positions the university decades behind in higher education practice and policy. The first student resource center created for LGBTQ+ students was founded in 1971 at the University of Michigan (Dilly, 2002). Legal cases against institutions of higher education forced many colleges and universities to respond with changes in their support structures to include LBGTQ+ students. Although there were no post-secondary education policies for the development of queer spaces and support services, pressures from LGBTQ+ students inherently created an ethics of care from higher education during the Gay Liberation Movement to present day.  In this dissertation, scholars of the history of higher education, administrators, student affairs professionals, and policy makers will find that UND struggled in creating a balance between meeting minimum expectations of policy to appease external stakeholders and the duty and responsibility to serve LGBTQ+ students. The foundation of LGBTQ+ centers and student support initiatives were developed to address injustice, to educate, and to provide a foundation of support for students to achieve academic access. Throughout its history, UND struggled to demonstrate a commitment to LGBTQ+ students beyond what was required by federal policy. The concerns with the proposed gender inclusion policy shows the power that external forces have over the university. In his press conference, President Armacost reiterated policy by using language such as “protected class” and “federal law” to justify his decision. The piece that was missing was the impact the policy would have had on LGBTQ+ students in creating safety, support, a sense of belonging, and a clear action of a demonstrated commitment to the community.  107  UND’s role is brought to question in this dissertation. As a flagship institution, UND is the state’s leader in higher education. The history shows that UND became a cultural battleground for LGBTQ+ rights in North Dakota. This is evident through its commitment to recognizing the first LGBTQ+ student organization in the state, the creation of the first LGBTQ+ center, the first hiring of a full-time staff member dedicated to supporting LGBTQ+ students, and the first in the state to introduce a gender inclusion policy. These efforts were behind in comparison to national trends of higher education, but, the challenge that UND continues to experience is the norms of social opposition towards LGBTQ+ people in the North Dakota. Conservative politics, oppressive external institutions to UND, and adequate support resources prohibit progress from the university but also inadvertently create a driving force for UND to become innovative and strategic in their quests. Higher education serves as a public good and a driver of social change. Although UND has failed to expand protections with the gender inclusion policy, institutional leaders can seek out alternative methods for the advancement of LGBTQ+ support. The actions ignited a conversation across the state and posing a challenge to opposing forces. UND as a leader across the state helps set the stage to drive efforts towards diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education.  Implications for Practice This dissertation provides a historical understanding to how LGBTQ+ services were shaped by student activism. LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support networks and provide the campus with awareness education. The creation of LGBTQ+ programs and services lessened the burden students were experiencing, and they were able to just be students and focus on their own well-being and academic success. However, the creation of the programs and services was not a total commitment for supporting LGBTQ+ 108  students on campus. In this dissertation, the queer history shows that LGBTQ+ students need more than just a physical space, but they also need a cultural shift of acceptance and inclusion. Student affairs professionals and university administrators can use the history to advocate for the development of additional staff positions, new resource offerings, and expansion of student recruitment and outreach initiatives. Additionally, education is also a key component for changing the campus climate; training programs for new faculty and staff alongside reevaluating course curriculum to be LGBTQ+ inclusive are effective tools to create a cultural shift in higher education. A greater institutional commitment to LGBTQ+ students at UND, the flagship university in North Dakota, can influence social change in the North Dakota University System to dismantle systems of oppression that exist within the state.   Erin Rand (2014) expresses that the queer activists and organizations of the 1990s are not as active today, but their influence on LGBTQ+ lives in the fight for social change now takes place in our history as role models and sources of inspiration for a new queer world. Students can use this dissertation to understand queer history at UND and in North Dakota to contextualize their own experience but to also engage in activism on campus. The narrative provided insight into queer resistance, forms of activism, and how to create effective change. This dissertation is an attempt to disrupt the narrative that queer liberation is a movement from the past and to redirect it to the present. The story of LGBTQ+ resiliency and student activism at the UND does not get the happy conclusion of a battle won but provides hope leading to the next chapter in the fight for equality. 109    REFERENCES  Beemyn, B.

    "abstract": "This study explores the queer history of the University of North Dakota from 1980 to present day and demonstrates how LGBTQ+ student activism lead to the development of LGBTQ+ programs and services at the University. Situated in a socially and politically conservative state, the University of North Dakota provides an understanding of how LGBTQ+ students organized in the 1980s out of necessity to combat social opposition and discriminatory state legislation. LGBTQ+ students were burdened with the responsibility to create their own support services and resources as there is no historical evidence of the university administration taking steps to improve the campus environment for LGBTQ+ students prior to the development of programs and services in 2017. This study contributes to the historical study of LGBTQ+ people by centering on LGBTQ+ student activism in higher education. Grounded in critical historical inquiry, oral history interviews, and primary source evidence aids in telling a more complete story of queer history at the University and connecting it to the current affairs and status on the institutional commitment to LGBTQ+ students, faculty, and staff. It also uses queer theory as a theoretical framework to guide and understanding of LGBTQ+ student experiences and the oppression they faced that lead to queer resistance. This study argues how LGBTQ+ student advocacy and activism was the driving force for the University of North Dakota, the flagship university in the state, to become a cultural battleground in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality",
