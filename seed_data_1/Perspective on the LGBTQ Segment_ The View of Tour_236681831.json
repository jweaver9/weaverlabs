The growth of tourism in the municipality and the \nincreasing acceptance of alternative lifestyles, as well as the recent law that supports non-\ndiscrimination, allowed a favourable conjuncture for the expansion of the LGBTQ tourist \nsegment, which represents a global share of 12% (IGLTA, 2012). Despite this favourable \nsituation, the municipality of Porto is still regarded as conservative.  \nThis work aims to identify the openness of the municipality of Porto towards the LGBTQ \nsegment, by perceiving if there is a response and treatment similar to those offered to \nheterosexual tourists, or if there are signs of prejudice based on the sexual orientation of \nthe tourist. An analysis of the practices, behaviours, actions and strategies of the \nprofessionals of a random sample of accommodation establishments located in Porto \nwas conducted through a semi-structured interview to 16 employees of these \nestablishments, who were knowledgeable enough to answer the questions (ranging from \ndirectors and managers to receptionists). The interviews were mostly conducted face to \nface, with only one by e-mail and two by telephone. All of them were transcribed for \nfurther analysis, being structured in main four groups (the LGBTQ segment, the hotel \ntowards this segment, Porto as a LGBTQ destination, and sociodemographic profile of \nrespondents). \nResults indicate that hotel professionals do not show any kind of homophobic behaviour \nor embarrassment in customer service towards any type of client. In part, they feel \ncomfortable with the LGBTQ community because many of the interviewees have co-\nworkers or friends that are part of this community, and because they are part of a young \ngeneration more open and advocate of equal rights. Results also show that there is a \npositive attitude towards the LGBTQ community that allows LGBTQ tourists to choose \nand return to the destination, as well as this community feels comfortable being in their \n“own skin”, that is, not feeling oppressed or threatened by expressing their sexuality in \npublic. \nThis research contributed to more information on the LGBTQ community in Portugal, \nand specifically in the municipality of Porto, using a holistic perspective and not being \nonly focused on the homosexual market. It also contributes to a greater knowledge on the \ntourism supply for the LGBTQ community and the importance that this community has \nfor a tourism destination. \nKeywords: LGBTQ-friendly, accommodation, tourist supply, market discrimination, sexual \nprejudice\n2\nCritical Tourism Studies Proceedings, Vol. 2019 [2019], Art. 88\nhttps://digitalcommons.library.tru.ca/cts-proceedings/vol2019/iss1/88\nIntroduction \nThe LGBTQ community, when leaving its area of residence, work and socializing, seeks to meet \nother people who validate their sexual identity and corroborate their way of being and acting, \nsharing the same values or even being in spaces where they feel that they will not be harassed, \narrested or targeted for stigma (Hughes, 1997; Monterrubio & Barrios, 2016; Sharpley, 1994). \nSince the attitude of the local community towards this segment limits its perspective of destination \nexperience, it becomes relevant to analyze its receptivity towards LGBTQ tourists. \nThe “Second Global Report on LGBT Tourism” (World Tourism Organization, 2017) informs on \nthe economic importance of tourism in recent decades, especially in relation to the LGBTQ \nsegment, highlighting its contribution to economic development, as well as the image of tolerance \nand respect that destinations receiving the LGBTQ community transmit. Considering the \nrelevance of this market segment and the need for research in this area, this work aims to \ndetermine the extent to which the destination of Porto has or not openness to this niche \nmarket, namely in tourist accommodation establishments, and to verify if a self-proclaimed \nLGBTQ-friendly or gay-friendly establishment in fact is, and how it differs from others. \n \nBeing LGTBQ traveler in Porto \nPorto, located in the north of Portugal, is the second largest city of the country, being elected \nrecently “Best European Destination” three times, which contributed to an enormous international \nnotoriety and tourism growth. Portugal is a country with a liberal society, fulfilling 69% of the \nhuman rights for the gay community (ILGA Europe, 2017): it combines the acceptance of an \nalternative lifestyle and incorporates and supports it in the legislative norms – for instance, same-\nsex marriage has been legal since 2010 (LGBT, 2018), bringing tangible and intangible benefits \nto Porto (Jordan & Traveller, 2018). \nThe high acceptance of the LGTBQ community contributes to Porto being one of the most popular \ntourism destinations in Europe for this market segment (TwoBadTourists, 2015). However, Porto, \ndespite respecting the rights for this community, is still a conservative city, not promoting openly \ngay-oriented tourism supply through its official channels. For this reason and given the increasing \ninterest of the gay community to visit Porto, a private company created a travel guide titled “Porto \nGay Circuit” (Publituris, 2016), allowing Porto, in the year of the launching of this project, to be \nconsidered a “gay-friendly” destination (Queer Feed, 2016). The “Porto Gay Circuit” promotes \nsome service orientated for the LGBTQ community, like bars, restaurants, accommodation, \nculture, shops, saunas, tours and other services of interest (Porto Gay Circuit, 2018). \nIn the opinion of Queer in the World (2018), a blog and online resource for gay and lesbian \ntravelers, Porto is able to offer the LGBTQ community interesting nightlife, cultural events, \n3\nAndrade et al.: Perspective on the LGBTQ Segment: The View of Tourism Accommodati\nPublished by Digital Commons @ TRU Library, 2019\nmuseums, art galleries, wine cellars, beaches, among others. The existent attractions, equipment \nand services allowed the development of this market segment in Porto, although it is still small \nwhen compared to others European cities, such as Amsterdam, Paris or Berlin. Even though the \nexisting gay-oriented or gay-friendly supply is not much, tourists feel good and safe. \n \nSexual diversity, prejudice and discrimination \nThe more the homosexual community is exposed to stigmas, the more individuals feel excluded \nand believe to be of a lower social identity (Stenger & Roulet, 2018), leading them to be unable \nto express their sexuality or to meet secretively people with the same sexual orientation (Visser, \n2003), since an identity, especially the sexual identity, needs to be validated by others. \nSexual identity influences the way individuals introduce themselves to the community which they \nare part of (Hughes, 1997). However, despite self-identity being the result of the environment \nwhere they are inserted, not always individuals relate with what the society is expecting from \nthem. When they do not fit into the expectations, they may face situations of stigma and prejudice \n– created by sociodemographic, psychological or religious beliefs (Brown & Henriquez, 2008; \nHerek, 2002, 2015; Norton & Herek, 2013; Schope & Eliason, 2000; Stenger & Roulet, 2018; \nWalters & Moore, 2002; Worthen, Lingiardi, & Caristo, 2017). Individuals can also be treated as \nminorities and discriminated against in the acquisition of services (Poria, 2006), which can lead \nto the decrease in the consumers’ self-esteem and feeling of humiliation (Walsh, 2009). There is \nalmost an imposition of abnormality when it comes to LGBTQ community because when it is \nsaid that homosexuals, bisexuals or queers and others, are ‘normal’ it seems that it is in question \nsome sort of disability.  \nWhen gay consumers acquire services and are discriminated against, or denied access to, this \nleads to the inhibition of consumption practices (Poria, 2006), since they avoid going to places \nwhere they do not feel welcome (Gremler, Bitner, & Evans, 1994). When negative word-of-mouth \n(WOM) is provided due to poor service delivery it implies poor publicity of the customer \nexperience passed on to potential service customers – and today it spreads faster through the \nonline community (eWOM). When gay consumers are exposed to discrimination, they may even \nfile formal complaints to expose it to the whole community (Munar & Jacobsen, 2014), in order \nto reduce market share and create a negative public image (Walters & Moore, 2002). \nService experience greatly influences loyalty. Usually staff isn’t trained to assimilate information \nwhen they react or change their behavior towards same-sex clients (Poria, 2006). In order not to \nfeel discriminated against, gay tourists opt, for example, not to ask for a double bed at the check-\nin (Lucena, Jarvis, & Weeden, 2015). This, in particular, explains the need of accommodation \n4\nCritical Tourism Studies Proceedings, Vol. 2019 [2019], Art. 88\nhttps://digitalcommons.library.tru.ca/cts-proceedings/vol2019/iss1/88\nestablishments to provide training to their staff in order to raise awareness and ensure a better \nservice experience to their guests (Berezan, Raab, Krishen, & Love, 2015). It is not essential that \nthe establishments call themselves “gay-friendly”, what is important is the existence of non-\ndiscriminatory policies for employees and guests, training on diversity and sensitivity, \ninvolvement with the gay community and partnerships with agencies working with gay people \n(IGLTA, 2012). \n \nMethodology \nIn this study, which is qualitative in nature, it was chosen to conduct a semi-structured interview. \nThis type of interview allows it to become more like a conversation, creating empathy with the \ninterviewees. The interview was recorded with the authorization of the interviewees, guaranteeing \ntheir anonymity. \nThe interview aimed to understand what is the perception of hotel staff towards the LGBTQ \ncommunity and what are their role in providing a positive experience to this market segment; and \nto understand the vision of the market that service providers professionals have about the city of \nPorto, and how they can be effectively welcomed. \nThe script of the interview contained 16 open-ended questions, divided in four sections: \nperception about the LGBTQ segment; the establishment towards the LGBT segment; Oporto as \na LGBTQ destination; and sociodemographic profile of the respondent. \nA total of 16 interviews were conducted to general managers or front desk / office managers, with \nan average age of 33 years old, mainly male and graduates in hotel management, living in the \nmunicipality of Porto. \n \nResults \nAn openness to the good reception of the LGBTQ segment has been demonstrated, as respondents \nmentioned that they have friends and co-workers who belong to the LGBTQ community and, \ntherefore, people who know LGBTQ people have less prejudices and relate more easily to the \nsituation (Howerton, Meltzer, & Olson, 2012): “I have friends who are gay and are people I would \nnever tell if they did not tell me otherwise\" (E7). \nThe people who work in the accommodation establishments under analysis are mostly dynamic \nyoung people and their beliefs in the community are positive - as predicted by Lewis et al. (2017), \nresulting in an endorsement of sexual choices (as Stenger and Roulet (2018) review in their study). \nThey are pleased to be able to be at ease with public demonstrations of affection, which are a \n5\nAndrade et al.: Perspective on the LGBTQ Segment: The View of Tourism Accommodati\nPublished by Digital Commons @ TRU Library, 2019\nguarantee that LGBTQ people are being accepted and safe in the municipality - as observed in \nthe study of Hughes (1997) and Köllen and Lazar (2012). \nOn the other hand, male respondents, for reasons of masculinity, as revealed by the study of Eagly, \nWood and Joahannesen-Schmidt (2004), emphasized that they are heterosexual. It is denoted the \nfocus is on their acceptance for sexual orientation and forgetting that the LGBTQ community is \nnot only evident by homosexuals, but represents their opinions focused only on homosexuals. \nAnd finally, the imposition of abnormality, since there is a need to define the LGBTQ community \nas “being normal”. \nRespondents mentioned several times that the establishment where they work does not have the \nability to select the clients they receive, and so people do not need to have labels that identify \ntheir gender or sexual orientation. In that way, there is an equal treatment that guarantees that they \nnever have discrimination problems, except for the fact that they do not have training to know \nhow to behave with the LGBTQ community, especially in check-in situations (Poria, 2006), since \nsome interviewees admitted that they had already identified discomfort on the part of the client \nand employees at the time of check-in. \nIt is noticeable the fact that most hotels do not want to be advertised as LGBTQ-friendly because \nthey do not want to differentiate customers and they believe that announcing themselves as \nLGBTQ-friendly would diminish the number of heterosexual clients. Only one hotel is promoted \nas LGBTQ-friendly and use it as a marketing technique, promoting respect and kindness towards \nthe community and participating in several activities. \nThe interviewees perceive the growth of the LGBTQ tourism market as being associated with the \ndevelopment of the rights towards this community (Clift and Wilkins, 1995, quoted by \nVorobjovas-Pinta & Hardy, 2016). They also view it as a market of great importance since it has \npertinent sociodemographic characteristics: \"They are in my opinion clients that have a high \neconomic power\" (E1), being the market associated with DINK and \"pink-money\" (Badgett, \n2001; Hughes, 2005; Hughes, Monterrubio, & Miller, 2010; Pritchard, Morgan, Sedgley, Khan, \n& Jenkins, 2000; Visser, 2003; Walters & Moore, 2002). \n \nConclusion \nThis study shows that the tourism supply, namely accommodation, has the openness to receive \nthe LGBTQ community, thus contributing for it to be at ease with demonstrations of affection \nand feel accepted and safe in the municipality of Porto. It also allows us to conclude that there is \nno type of stigma or prejudice to receive a customer from this community, on the contrary, some \nof the interviewees even mention that they want to get more customers from this community, for \n6\nCritical Tourism Studies Proceedings, Vol. 2019 [2019], Art. 88\nhttps://digitalcommons.library.tru.ca/cts-proceedings/vol2019/iss1/88\nthe benefits they bring to their hotel, like any other customer that pays for the benefits to enjoy \nfrom this service. \nRespondents do not demonstrate any type of homophobic behaviour and demonstrate a \nwillingness to receive any type of client. In part, it is perceived as comfortable with the LGBTQ \ncommunity, since many of the interviewees have colleagues or friends who are part of the \ncommunity and as well, interact and are part of a young team that has a higher receptivity and \nsupport for equal rights, which can be enjoyed in the municipality under study. It is known that \nthese positive attitudes that are transmitted allow the tourists of the LGBTQ community to return \nto the destination.  \nHowever, it is necessary to take into account that despite the effort that they demonstrate to show \nthat they treat all clients equally, since a hotel should not differentiate the type of client that it \nreceives, but they refer to being afraid to advertise as friends of the community since they fear \nlosing heterosexual clients. In addition, the lack of perspective to train employees to deal with the \nLGBTQ community has led to some hotels having problems at check-in. \nHowever, from  the personal point of view, more empirical evidence is needed to verify the truth \nof what is presented in this research, since there are other elements to be taken into account in \norder to effectively verify that a destination can be said to be LGBTQ-friendly and that the offer \ntourism is more than the tourist accommodation units. \n  \n7\nAndrade et al.: Perspective on the LGBTQ Segment: The View of Tourism Accommodati\nPublished by Digital Commons @ TRU Library, 2019\nReferences \nBadgett, L.
