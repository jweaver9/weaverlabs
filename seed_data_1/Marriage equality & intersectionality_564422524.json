Prominent lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) figures haveargued that marriage is an oppressive institution and thatlegalizing same-sex marriage would not benefit the mostmarginalized members of the community, particularlyBlack people. Until now, there have been few resources forcomparing these claims of scholars and activists with thoseof members of the communities they claim to represent.Guided by Critical Race Theory and intersectionality, thisstudy centered LGBTQ people of color’s lived experiences.A purposive sample of 99 LGBTQ people in Chicago, NewYork City, and San Francisco were asked whether and howthe SupremeCourt’s decision inObergefell v.Hodges (2015)personally impacted them. Most participants described anemotional impact. Relatively few criticized marriages as“heteronormative” or unfit for LGBTQ people. Black par-ticipants were less likely than participants of other racesto criticize marriage as an institution. Moreover, Black andLatinx participants articulated a more expansive, equality-focused understanding of the right tomarry than the Courtitself articulated.

For these people, the marriageequality movement was centrally about equality ratherthan marriage.INTRODUCTIONIn 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry(Obergefell v. Hodges (2015)). Although the Court held that the state laws before it violated theDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment, it wrote much more aboutthe importance of marriage than principles of equal treatment. Moreover, the marriage equalitymovement selected affluentWhite people as the face of the community (Godsoe, 2015), and all theplaintiffs discussed by the Court were White gays or lesbians (Robinson & Frost, 2018c). Most ofthe media coverage of the case similarly featured White cisgender people, played up the rhetoricabout the importance of marriage, and said less about equality (Liptak, 2015).For decades activists and scholars have debated whether a legal right to same-sex marriagewould benefit sexual and gender minorities broadly or only the most privileged members of thecommunity (Ettelbrick, 1989). The current study bridges legal and marriage and family schol-arship to better understand the impact of marriage policy change on lived experiences amongmarginalized communities. The study uses Critical Race Theory and intersectionality to producea robust examination of how participants, especially LGBTQ people of color, understood the rela-tionship between the right to marry and racial and sexual orientation equality more generally.Much research on same-sex marriage has relied on overwhelmingly White samples (Lannutti,2005), and as noted by a recent review in the Journal of Marriage and Family, many scholars writ-ing in this area fail to consider race or do so superficially (Reczek, 2020). By contrast, this studycenters on LGBTQ people of color and those of various relationship statuses (single, married,partnered, or dating).A prominent and vocal group of critics has assailed same-sex marriage and themarriage equal-ity movement on multiple fronts. Lesbian feminists have claimed that marriage is a “patriarchalsystem that looks to ownership, property, and dominance of men over women as its basis.” (Ettel-brick, 1989). Queer theorists have opposed same-sex marriage as an attempt to “domesticate”non-normative sexual practices, such as public sex (Franke, 2004;Warner, 1999). Some such schol-ars and activists argue that the rights and benefits of marriage should extend to numerous sexualand relational arrangements (Duggan, 2008). Many scholars and activists blend concerns aboutgender, sexuality, and government power, denouncing marriage as “a technology of social con-trol” that “puts a stamp of ‘equality’ on systems that remain brutally harmful, because a fewmoreprivileged people will get something from the change.” (Spade & Willse, 2013). Relatedly, somescholars have warned that historically government has used marriage to regulate the sexuality ofBlack people (Franke, 2015).Contemporary Black voices have also resisted the campaign for same-sex marriage. The forceof two of these critiques is evident from their titles: Is Gay Marriage Anti Black??? and Is GayMarriage Racist? (Bailey et al., 2008; Farrow, 2007). According to some advocates, the marriageequality movement is “led by White, middle-class gays and lesbians who would largely benefitfrom same-sex marriage. . . [Black queer people] are not the ones who stand to gain anything”(Bailey et al., 2008; Cannick, 2008). Kenyon Farrow argues that “gay marriage, in and of itself, 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

It does not address my most critical needas a black gay man to be able to walk down the streets of my community with my lover, spouseor trick, and not be subjected to ridicule, assault or even murder.” Angela P. Harris worries thatsame-sex marriage may simply “pave a path that takes us from Stonewall to the suburbs,” whilesidestepping the structural economic issues that lock in the subordination of most Black people(Harris, 2006).Another body of work, including some of our own, critiques the racial politics of the marriageequality movement, rather than same-sex marriage itself (Robinson & Frost, 2018b). From thisperspective, “[m]arriage equality is a deeply important step toward eliminating discriminatorysocial policies and structural stigma in LGBT lives.” (Robinson&Frost, 2018b). Yet some decision-makers in themovement unnecessarily framed their arguments in divisive terms, such as arguingthat “gay is the new Black”—thus erasing people with the intersectional identity of gay and Black(Robinson, 2014). Moreover, we have argued that the movement generally failed to demonstratehow the question of access to marriage relates to broader questions of structural inequality forsexual and gender minorities. (Robinson & Frost, 2018b).In general, there have been few resources for comparing racial critiques by scholars and activistswith the views of the lay people in the communities that they claim to represent. Themost notablesurvey of LGBTQ Americans’ views on same-sex marriage was released in 2013 (Pew ResearchCenter, 2013). It found that 93% of respondents supported legalizing same-sex marriage and didnot discuss any racial differences in opinions on marriage.A General Social Survey asked LGB respondents from 2004 to 2012 if “homosexual couplesshould have the right tomarry one another” and found a significant racial gap in support (Hunter,2013). Both African-American and “non-White” LGBs were less likely to support same-sex mar-riage. For instance, in 2012, about 51% of White people supported the right, while only 41% ofAfrican-Americans did (Hunter, 2013). Some evidence suggests that greater religiosity amongAfrican-Americans may be a significant factor in producing less support (Pew Research Center,2013). But surveys such as this do not provide qualitative evidence of the particular reasons whyLGBTQ people embrace or reject same-sex marriage or have more conflicted or nuanced reac-tions. Further, the data for prior studies were collected before the Court ruled in favor of same-sexmarriage in 2013 and again in 2015. Our study appears to be the first to gauge the reactions ofLGBTQ participants in the wake of the Court’s groundbreaking decision in Obergefell.This study calls for grounding the understanding of the significance of marriage equality in thenarratives of everyday people who grapple with various forms of discrimination. Intersectionalityexplores how systems of subordination (such as racism and patriarchy) overlap to produce distinctforms of vulnerability (Bowleg, 2008; Crenshaw, 1989). Crenshaw invited the reader to imaginemarginalized communities as a throng of people trapped in a basement. These people are orga-nized so that people with a single source of vulnerability (say, a White cisgender gay man) are atthe top and those with multiple sources of vulnerability (say, a poor, Black, transgender, queerwoman) are stuck at the bottom. Legal reform, per this metaphor, may resemble the temporaryopening of an escape hatch at the top of the basement. Those with a sole source of disadvantageare well-positioned to wriggle through the hatch. But most people in the basement will remaintrapped and experience little meaningful change in their wellbeing.Critical race scholars have argued that “those who have experienced discrimination speak witha special voice to which we should listen” (Carbado, 2002; Matsuda, 1987). By “looking to thebottom” of society, we can learn from lived experiences beyond our own. Although some of thisscholarship did not fully explore the intersectionality of marginalized voices (Matsuda, 1987), thisbottom-up approach dovetails with Crenshaw’s concern about those trapped in the basementwhile their more-privileged peers crawl through the escape hatch. The hope is that by “looking 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

Although attendingto the lived experiences of people impacted by a policy is important, it reveals only part of thebroader picture as to the social impact of marriage equality. Our participants described their per-sonal experiences in a specific, temporal moment, but could not fully address the question as towhethermarriage equality, as a general matter, would ultimately facilitate assimilation of a subsetof LGBTQ people into the mainstream or have a more transformative impact on society and theLGBTQ community.This study supplements the longstanding controversy over same-sex marriage by focusing onthe lived experiences of 99 LGBTQ people in the Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco-EastBay metropolitan areas who discussed what the Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell meantto them and their life possibilities. Narrative psychology teaches that people make meaning oftheir lived experiences by creating, telling, and retelling stories (Bruner, 1991; Josselson et al.,2007). Moreover, scientific evidence revealing how ordinary people describe the impact of policiesmay inform social justice movements and legal reform. This stream in narrative psychology iscompatible with legal scholarship in Critical Race Theory (Robinson, 2008; Williams, 1987) andFeminist Theory (Abrams, 1991) that deploy personal narrative as a methodology for illuminatingdiscrimination. The research question was: How do racially diverse sexual and gender minorityindividuals perceive the Supreme Court’s marriage decision’s personal impact on their lives andrelationships?METHODOur data come from the LGBT Relationships Study, a qualitative study that began interviewingLGBTQ people a few months after the Court decided Obergefell in June 2015 and completedinterviews in summer 2019.1RecruitmentSexual and gender minorities represent a “hidden population,” and studying them raises distinctchallenges (Meyer & Wilson, 2009). This problem is magnified if one is committed to includinga substantial number of LGBTQ people of color, who constitute a minority within a minoritygroup. This study is exceptional in placing people of color at the center, while also includingWhiteparticipants. Most leading empirical studies (like marriage equality litigators) focus on “same-sexrelationships” and do not seek to include transgender and non-binary people. Our quota samplingdesign oversampled these populations, and most of the transgender and non-binary participantsare people of color. Given the intersectional objective of our study, we set a larger than normalsample size. Our aim was to achieve a critical mass of multiple subgroups based on intersectionsof race, sexual orientation, and gender identity and increase our ability to achieve saturation ofthemes (Vasileiou et al., 2018).Our study obtained participants from a wide range of venues associated with LGBTQ popula-tions in three major cities, Chicago, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area. We modeledthis list of venues on a database created for the Generations Study.2 Working with a team of young1 Our study website is at: https://www.law.berkeley.edu/lgbtrelationships/.2 For information on this study, see http://www.generations-study.com/. 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

We deliberately limited the number of participants from each venue to two, being particu-larly cautious about overreliance on mainstream LGBTQ venues, such as Gay Pride and bars andnightclubs. Venues included coffee shops, bookstores, barbershops, street fairs, people of color-oriented community groups, and churches. We also recruited participants through ads placed onFacebook. In addition, the researchers tapped their professional networks for potential partici-pants. Finally, we used snowball sampling—asking participants who sat for interviews to referpeople in their social networks.Advertisements for the study included a link to a brief online screening questionnaire to assesseligibility. Participants were eligible if they were between ages 18 and 65, did not identify asheterosexual and cisgender, and had any experience with dating or relationships.We set quotas to make sure that the study would include a substantial number of Black, Lat-inx, and Asian-American participants. We oversampled transgender and non-binary people, whohave often been overlooked inmarriage research. A total of 992 people responded to the eligibilityquestionnaire. After the research team assessed eligibility and compliance with quota samplingneeds, we invited 120 participants for an interview. Of those invited, 83% completed interviews.Interviews typically lasted 60–90 min and took place in a research office or private location of theparticipant’s choosing. Participants received a $50 pre-paid visa card as a token of appreciation fortheir taking part in the study.SampleParticipant demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. Slightly more than half of ourparticipants identified as gay or lesbian. Half identified as queer, bisexual, transgender, gender-queer, and/or non-binary, among several other labels. People of color (68%) make up the majorityof our participants. Thirty percent of our sample identified as Latinx. Thirty-two percent identifiedas White. Twenty-three percent of participants identified as Black; 13% identified as Asian-American; and 31% identified as mixed race (many of whom also identified as Latinx). Fifty-sixpercent of participants reported that they were assigned male sex at birth; 41% were assignedfemale sex at birth; and 1% identified as intersexed. The majority of participants were cisgender;nearly one-third of participants were not cisgender: 10% identified as transgender, and 15% iden-tified as genderqueer. Seven percent identified their gender as “something else” and wrote in aparticular identity or identities. Table 2 provides the income distribution of participants. Table 3provides the income distribution of participants by race. (Eleven participants did not provideincome data.)ProcedureThe study interview contained many questions concerning the general topics of experi-ences with relationships and discrimination over the participant’s entire life span. Theinterview protocol (available upon request) covered multiple specific topics including race,gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, family dynamics, sexual behavior, stigma of vari-ous forms, and health issues, including HIV, alcohol and substance abuse, and mental healthconcerns. 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

Has this decision impacted your thoughts about marriage? If so,in what ways? Unmarried participants were also asked whether they personally were interestedin marrying and why or why not. We did not describe the reasoning of the Court in Oberge-fell, and it seems likely that most participants had not read the full opinion. Instead, they likelyrelied on news summaries of the decision and other informal avenues of information, includingconversations with friends and on social media.AnalysisInterviews were professionally transcribed, and transcripts were entered into Dedoose for analy-sis.3 We developed an approach to analysis based on the thematic analysis protocol recommendedby Braun and Clark (2006). First, the first author read the transcripts in depth to begin the processof data emersion. Next, the lead author and two graduate students engaged in a process of opencoding, whereby a portion of the transcripts were again read line by line and descriptive codeswere applied to relevant concepts in the text using Dedoose. The researchers then refined this listof descriptive codes into a codebook based on the research questions at the center of the study(codebook available upon request). The second author reviewed and helped to revise the code-book. The first author and a different graduate student applied the codes to all the transcripts,which was followed by further meetings to align understandings of the codes, resolve discrepan-cies, and refine the codebook. We used the Dedoose testing center in order to assess consistencyin coding (inter-rater reliability) across the coding team. After all transcripts were coded, the firstauthor reviewed coding reports in Dedoose and linking categories and explanatory themes wereidentified in relation to the overarching research question. TheUniversity of California, Berkeley]Institutional Review Board approved this research (protocol number 2014-02-6070).RESULTSWe identified several themes in participants’ responses to the specific questions about marriageequality and the SupremeCourt rulings: (1) EmotionallyMeaningful for the Participant, (2)Happythat Other People Can Marry, (3) Provides A Frame for Understanding One’s Relationship Pos-sibilities, (4) Distant From or Not “For” a Participant’s Community, (5) Criticism of Marriage asa Priority within the LGBTQ Community, (6) Criticism of Marriage as Heteronormative, Patri-archal, or Inconsistent with Queer Values, (7) LGBTQ People Deserve Equal Rights, (8) FamilyMembers’ Reaction to Marriage Equality Decisions, (9) Just a Means to a Practical End, (10) Pro-vides No Legal Benefit to the Subject, and (11) Other Views. Happy that Other People CanMarry isa child code of Emotionally Meaningful, the parent code. Although both codes involve emotionalmeaning, in the child code, the happiness stemmed less from the participant’s personal experiencewithmarriage than other people’s marital opportunities.We coded all transcripts, which includedsearching for instances of the abovementioned themes. We present the results for all codes butfocus on the most prominent themes, providing illustrative quotations as evidence in support3 Dedoose Version 8.0.35, web application formanaging, analyzing, and presenting qualitative andmixedmethod researchdata (2018).

Frequencies and percentages are pro-vided for the purpose of describing the sample and dataset and should not be seen as numericallygeneralizable to the population of interest.Emotionally meaningful for the participantA slim majority of participants (55%) described Obergefell as having an emotionally meaningfulimpact on them. Lesbians were the sexual orientation subgroup most likely to report an emo-tionally meaningful impact, and they were followed by gay-identified people (most of whomwere men). Most of the participants who identified as women described themselves as queeror bisexual, not lesbian. Notably, non-cisgender participants—genderqueer, transgender, and“other” gender—were less likely to describe an emotional impact. The racial pattern on this ques-tion was complex: White, multiracial, and Latinx participants were more likely than Blacks andAsian-Americans to articulate an emotional impact.The following exchange involves a bisexual Latina in her mid-20s who lives in Chicago. Shedescribed the impact of her professor coming out to the class after Obergefell:Interviewee: I remember Iwas in class one day and this professor said she finally is ableto marry her partner. No one in the class thought she was ever a lesbian or anythinglike that. It’s just one of those like, “Wait here.” Then it also hit me like, I never knew.Then I thought. . . she is like one of those most religious people that I’ve ever met, fora Catholic, and she was just so open about it. I was just like, oh. Then I thought, wait,you’re really, really religious, why does that feel like there’s something wrong withthat? I was like, oh, okay. Then it just made me feel happier.

I was, “Youwere so conservative. Youwere really good at hiding that then.” Because she’s like thiselderly [woman]. Things like that made me really happy ’cause she was already 67 orsomething.Interviewer: Why did it make you happy?Interviewee: Because it made me realize, someone that was struggling for that longand was hiding for it, all of a sudden is so just happy to know that this is one littlething that would just change her life. She was showing all these pictures as if it justhappened yesterday that she met her and they just got engaged, when really they’vebeenmarried for this long but now it’s officially noted.We’re like, nowwe just get thisidea. Then I started to realize there was more [same-sex couples] holding hands nowall of a sudden in public. . . I remember a couple saying the reason they always holdhands is because they remember when they were little, they saw a couple do that,and they were a little kid looking at that and thinking, that’s hope, that was theirsign of hope that maybe one day I can hold a hand too. That’s why I tend to alwayshold hands [with my female, Latina partner], ’cause you never know how people areperceiving it or what you’re making somebody feel.Interviewer: To let children know that this is a possibility for you?Interviewee: It’s a possibility. For now, it’s even more official to have the governmentsaying, you know, taking the church and state out, it’s insane. Okay, this is somethingthat we’re accepting, this is something that’s a possibility. I felt like it brought morehope in many places. . . . For me personally, it just gave me this idea like, okay, so nowthis is a possibility of getting married andmaybe having a real wedding where maybethere’s more of a chance to convince family and public that this is an accepting thing.Now all of a sudden, things like that. Before, I honestly didn’t feel like I’d ever evenwant a wedding, and I still have this weird like, “I don’t really want a big wedding.”Now it’smore of this idea like I get to choose if I want that, and theremight be actuallymore meaning to it versus this is just a party that we’re doing but really there’s not—it’s not legal.This young woman describes Obergefell as triggering a cascade of positive developments inher life and community that swept far beyond marriage itself. In this case, the marriage deci-sion inspired the woman’s teacher to come out to her class. The elder teacher’s coming outexploded the participant’s assumptions that very religious and “conservative” people could notalso be sexual minorities (an intersectional identity) and be public about their same-sex rela-tionships. Further, she suggests that the teacher’s coming out emboldened queer people, suchas her, to challenge oppressive norms in religious institutions. The Court’s legitimation of theparticipant’s capacity to wed her same-sex partner, she suggests, could be a powerful weapon 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

She hopes that this will makeit easier for her family to evolve and eventually support her relationship. Finally, she narratesan intergenerational chain of validating and encouraging other sexual minorities to assert theiridentities in public. The participant’s elder teacher came out during class, which inspired theparticipant and her partner to hold hands in public to serve as role models for the next genera-tion of queer children. This participant’s narrative is notable for how interconnected she regardsthe marriage decision with broader dimensions of equality, including coming out and visibility,equal treatment within religious institutions, family dynamics, and community formation. Theparticipant expressed happiness for her teacher’s marriage, but her emotions also encompassedhope for her own future and a desire to inspire young queer children by holding hands with herpartner.The following participant, an African-American gay man in his early 40s, expounded on theconnection between race and marriage. When asked about Obergefell, he reflected on marryingyears before the decision. This participant was a member of one of the first same-sex couples towed at New York City Hall after the state legalized same-sex marriage in 2011, and one of very fewBlack men whomarried another Black man on that day. (The lead author was at city hall that daydocumenting the identities of the couples that married).Interviewee: Certainly, when it happened and that day, a lot that we couldn’t foresee,that didn’t anticipate—the feeling of pride, the appreciation for the word freedom’cause you read about that, but now you can feel it. That was the first time in my lifebecause I’ve never been in the closet. It was the first time in my life that I said, oh,that’s what good old Harriet Tubman must’ve felt like. You know what I mean?Interviewer: Interesting.Interviewee: That is the first time I said, oh, this is—it makes my pride now. Youknow?Interviewer: Mm-hmm.Interviewee: But freedom. For our relationship, I felt Jake and I were very proud thatwe exercised freedom and we took advantage of it. We continued to do that in everyway in all realms of our life as individuals and as a couple.Although the Obergefell opinion and media coverage of the decision said little about race,this participant expressed an intersectional understanding of marriage equality. He interpolatedHarriet Tubman, a historical Black civil rights figure, into his experience as a Black gay man,newly able to participate in marriage to his Black male partner. For him, the experience wasnot simply about marriage, but extended into “all realms of our life as individuals and as acouple.”Another Black participant in New York, a non-binary person in their 30s, had a more ambiva-lent emotional reaction to the Court’s 2015 marriage equality decision because it was releasedduring the aftermath of a brutal hate crime, White supremacist Dylann Roof’s attack on a Blackchurch in South Carolina: 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

My father was a minister. . . his side of the family are from South Carolina. Ifelt this very intense connection to that incident, and that moment. It really affectedme, and I was mourning it pretty intensely. Then there was this decision about mar-riage equality with the Supreme Court, and there’s all these White gays in the streetdancing and shouting. It was wonderful, but I couldn’t really enjoy it. Anyways, allthat to say that I do remember it, and it was just a strange moment in history for me.This participant’s experience complicates a mainstream or “single axis” (Crenshaw, 1989)understanding ofmarriage equality.While someWhite gaymenwere dancing and celebrating, theparticipant, an African American, “felt a little alienated, and I felt not seen” because the churchshooting was equally relevant to their emotional state. Rejecting the conventional view of mar-riage equality as unrelated to race, this participant said: “You’re going to think of them as separateissues, but they’re not, because intersectionality is real. It [the timing of these events] just perfectlysummed it up for me.”Happy that other people can marrySeveral participants distinguished between their personal disinterest inmarriage or lack of oppor-tunity to marry and their happiness based on other members of the LGBTQ community beingable to marry. William, a Black transman in New York who reported earning less than $25,000 ayear, was living with his partner, a transwoman who had been abusive toward him and lied aboutbeingHIV-positive and doing sex work. AlthoughWilliam identifiedmarriage as a life goal, it wasnot accessible in the near term. William could not afford to move out of his partner’s home andexpected a long road to gaining financial stability and finding a suitable partner to marry. Williamalso did not see the legalization of same-sex marriage as impacting him personally because hehad changed his gender marker on government ID to male and typically dated women. Nonethe-less, William described Obergefell as an “amazing triumph. . . for all.” He noted that his brother, agay man, might take advantage of this new right. William expressed a desire for greater govern-ment action on anti-trans violence and access to healthcare, including gender-affirming care. ButWilliam was able to hold joy about same-sex marriage alongside ongoing concern for policy goalsimpacting transgender people.Tamika, a 20-year-old bisexual Blackwoman, had a similar response toObergefell. Tamika, wholived on the South Side of Chicago, had had turbulent, short-term relationships with women andmen. She left home at 16 after coming out to her parents and being physically attacked by herfather. At the time of the interview, Tamika was pregnant and planned to carry the fetus to term.Tamika reported an income below $25,000 and expected to rely on her bisexual aunt for helpin raising her child. Tamika recalled attending the Pride parade after the Court announced itsdecision. Although she was a teenager and had not experienced a stable romantic relationship,she stated, “I honestly am so happy that [same-sexmarriage] is legal now.” She explained: “I thinkI was really happy for other people who got the chance to do that who’s been together for so long.”Criticism of marriage as a priority within the LGBT communityRoughly 16% of the participants questioned the decision to make marriage the priority over pol-icy goals that they regarded as more pressing.

The participants who made this critique were also predominantly gendernon-conforming, genderqueer, transgender, and other gender.This Chicago participant, a Black gay man in his 50s, did not object to marriage per se, but hedid take issue with the marriage equality movement.Interviewee: I didn’t have an emotional [reaction]—again, this is me. This is the aca-demic inme. I have issueswithmarriage being at the forefront of the LGBTQmission.That being the prioritywhen therewere somany other things that I felt should have—not that they’re not disconnected, because of the way marriage [is] imbricated intoour culture and our laws. For instance, job discrimination and [the needs of] LGBTpeople of color was much more of an issue than marriage. Because for me, marriagewas just going to give gay White men more access to power and resources in a waythat Black gay men specifically would not have access to.This man, who happens to be an academic, shares the critique of the movement for puttingmarriage ahead of issues that some understand as more foundational, such as legal protectionfrom employment discrimination. Nonetheless, the narrative is more nuanced in that this partic-ipant had not ruled out marrying his long-term partner, who is aWhite gay man, the group whichhe regards as the primary beneficiary of the marriage equality movement.Along similar lines, another participant, a queer White woman in her 30s in Chicago,stated: “I mean, you can still be discriminated against legally in a lot of states, but [marriage]was one thing that you could have. Still feel like it was a Band-Aid solution to a lot of theissues.” A Black transgender, intersexed man in Chicago had a more visceral reaction to themovement:I just feel like, institutionally, we have a lot more to cover, not just marriage. We havea lot to cover for our trans sisters who aren’t surpassing the age of 32. We have a lotto cover for newly [HIV] positive [people] or what they call newly infected youth. . . .We have a lot to cover for homeless. . . in Chicago. . . . That’s 10,000 heads. Do youknow howmany beds are available for homeless queer kids? Ten, ten. In Chicago. . . .It’s f——- disgusting. It’s disgraceful. I’m not worried about Ken and Kyle wanna getmarried. I don’t care.This participant expressed anger at “Ken and Kyle,” presumably cisgender gay men, dominat-ing the LGBTQ rights movement and relegating issues such as homelessness, HIV risk amongyouth, and violence against transgender women to second-tier status. This man was not categori-cally opposed to marriage. He noted that his aunt protested at Stonewall and married her femalepartner in Illinois shortly before the aunt passed. Yet the participant, a poor, intersexed Blackmanof short stature, repeatedly referred to the devaluation of his body in romantic markets as a bar-rier to his romantic future. Marriage, he said, “does not affect me.” These comments suggest thestructural underpinnings of some Black men’s disaffection with marriage, including poverty, theprevalence of sexual racism and extreme body standards in the mainstream gay male community.(Robinson& Frost, 2018a). The formal equality framing of themovement declined to address such“private” matters, which may determine whether a person can actually exercise his newly con-ferred fundamental right to marry. A Black bisexual woman in her 30s in Chicago who organizeson issues of racial justice bristled at theWhite dominance of themarriage equalitymovement. Sheasserted: “When you ask Black queer people what their most pressing needs are, it’s not marriageequality. That tells us who you are actually fighting for.” 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

Giventhe prominence of queer critiques of marriage, it is striking that few participants in ourracially-diverse sample voiced this critique. Those who held this view were predominantly queer-identified or bisexual. As for race/ethnicity, Black participants were less likely to express a critiqueofmarriage as an institution. Blacksmade up 23% of all participants but just 8% ofmarriage critics.The following exchange is with a Latinx, gender non-conforming gay man in his 20s who livesin New York City.Interviewer: When the Supreme Court ruled in late June that same-sex marriage isavailable as a constitutional right, how did that impact you? How did you feel aboutthat?Interviewee: I certainly was not posting [on social media]. I remember all theseheterosexual girlfriends texting me: “Congratulations!” I said to one, “For what?”Interviewer: Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.Interviewee: “For what?”Interviewer: Did they understand that?Were they surprised that youweren’t partyingin the streets?Interviewee: Theywere surprised. Theywere very surprised. I didn’t changemy [statuson social media] to be one of the gay pride [flag]. . . . Yes, those are battles that werewon, and should be considered as parts of a battle, but I don’t want to be a personthat has rights because I’m married or that has rights because I serve a country. Idon’t want that. I think that marriage is an institution that should be abolished.Interviewer: Should be abolished?Interviewee: Yes! Single people should have rights—Interviewer: Mm-hmm.Interviewee: ––that people, who are married, have. I mean, this idea that we haverights—it seems very, I mean, yes, there’s money and stuff and property involved, 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

I don’t approve of that.Interviewer: Is that something that comes up in your relationships in terms of, do youmeet gay men that are [in] the “marriage-equality crowd”?Interviewee: Oh, yeah! Yeah, I was dating this guy Grant in the early part of the sum-mer. Imean, [he’s] a gay-equality andmarriage-equality whore. Canwemove beyondthat? Can we actually have a different set of demands that are not so much infectedby this assimilation, and this idea, but can we shape things up differently? Can webring other sets of questions that I think gay identity, and queer identity in particular,has been able to ask in the past?This participant spoke with a passion that resembled the Black intersexed manmentioned ear-lier. This person views marriage as so toxic that he bristled when heterosexual friends tried toaffirm him in the wake of the Court’s decision. Moreover, he describes marriage as creating aschism within the gay community, including his dating prospects. He denounced a man that hedated as a “marriage-equalitywhore”—adig perhaps designed to subvert the “dignity” that JusticeKennedy believes that marriage confers. This example speaks to the social and romantic implica-tions of legal and political disputes. Disagreement about same-sex marriage does not fall strictlyalong straight/gay lines. Moreover, for some LGBTQ people, the political is the personal, and dis-agreements about values, including the value of marriage, may disrupt romantic opportunitiesfor these people. (That said, some participants with ideological objections to marriage describedthem as fading when in a happy relationship with a partner who desired marriage.)The following excerpt involves a non-binary, African American graduate student in NorthernCalifornia:Interviewee: I think all my friends were excited [about Obergefell], and I was like,“Oh.” In many ways, I was not—I wasn’t enthusiastic. I was just like, “Oh. I meanthat’s just the elasticity of the state,” which is that when people become rebellious,or when they become revolutionary, the state finds a way to bring them back into itsfold, to shut them up. A part of me, who was doing a lot of activist queer work at thetime, felt like I was—themovement I was trying to create, which was a socialist, kindof anarchist movement, was being silenced by this other gay community over here,who was like, “We got our rights. Y’all got to fight us hard.” We’re like, “No. We don’thave trans rights. We don’t have Black rights.”Interviewer: Okay. Do you feel like same-sex marriage is important to people in yourcommunity, especially Black people?Do you feel like this is something that they valueor that it’s sort of like, “That’s not my issue. It doesn’t really pertain to my situation?”Interviewee: To be totally honest, in my—I was actually in Atlanta when the SupremeCourt ruled in favor of gaymarriage. I was actually at a Black, gay bar at the time, and 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

I think it was both. It wasn’t a total dis-announcement ofit.In this excerpt, the site of a gay bar sets the stage for disagreement within the Black, gaycommunity—the participant describes some people as “excited,” but others preferred a Black,heterosexual-focused soap opera to Obergefell. It is also interesting that this participant is botha graduate student and an activist, two groups which might be particularly likely to be exposedto queer critiques of marriage. Each of the last two participants used language reminiscent ofpublished critiques of same-sex marriage, such as “the elasticity of the state.” Like some ofthe published activist critiques noted earlier, this participant warned that marriage “isn’t gonnanecessarily improve the lives of Black people.”A White, queer-identified person in their 20s who lives in Chicago and does not identify witha gender at all disavowed marriage as follows:This is still a very government, and religious based institution that has a lot to dowithownership. I also really liked the idea of being in a relationship that doesn’t have thatoutside pressure to stay together, so being very confident in knowing I’m still in thisrelationship, because we both actively want to be here. Not just because it would betoo complicated to break up.This participant’s view contrasts with that of the first participant discussed in this study, thebisexual Latina whose teacher came out. While one participant regarded marriage as a problem-atic religious institution, the other saw the right to marry as empowering her within a religiousinstitution. 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

Some of them shared the critiques ofmarriage as an institution and/or the movement’s decision to prioritize marriage. But these con-cerns did not negate their conviction that Obergefell had transformed the status of LGBTQ peoplein society. This equality-focused group was disproportionately people of color—mainly Latinx,mixed race, and Black.A Filipino-American non-binary participant in NewYork said that they “firmly don’t believe inmarriage.” However, Trump’s election and assault on LGBTQ rights, as well as the participant’sexperience of falling in love, made themmore convinced that the right to marry is worth fightingfor.Interviewer: Do you see marriage equality as something that’s important for yourcommunity?Interviewee: That’s hard. Yes. Yes, because we—how do I formulate this—becauseeven though it is rooted in patriarchy and oppression, I think that it’s still importantin terms of proving queer peoples’ humanness. It’s important in proving us as validcitizens.Interviewer: You mentioned humanness. What impact do you think marriageequality has on humanness?Interviewee: Hmm. I think it’s, for me, been framed as an achievement of this free-dom, this freedom to live visibly and to live legally with your partner or with yoursignificant other. . .Interviewer: Do you feel like it’s about recognition, that society will see you, and seeand honor your relationship in marriage? Does that jive at all with what you werethinking?Interviewee: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It’s an acknowledgment and acceptance of it, at least.The positive reactions tomarriage equality were particularly notable when they came from par-ticipants who described meager prospects for marrying because of intersecting identities, such asrace and class. A bisexual Blackman in his 50s participated in themarriage equality movement inIllinois and describedObergefell as giving himhope that themarriage victorywould lead to similarbreakthroughs on other equality issues: “It gives you hope not just for the LGBTQ community, butfor the immigration community, for women, for anybody who’s marginalized. Things can change.Attitudes can change.” That said, his own relationship history was bleak—two of his Black male 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

For this man and other participants, the value of marriage extended beyond theirown interest in or access to marriage.The Black gay male academic in Chicago who has a White male partner (mentioned above)stated the case succinctly:For me, the question of marriage equality has been just about that. The equality part.It’s not been about—it hasn’t been about marriage as an institution. It’s about theright to do it if Iwanted. Because forme, and I think [mypartner] Justin feels the sameway. I’ve always had to pay taxes that facilitate heterosexual marriages. Whatever mytax dollars are going to, I should have access to that thing. For us, it was about thatmore than marriage.Provides a frame for understanding one’s relationship possibilitiesA biracial Black non-binary person in Northern California stated that the Court’s decision freedthem and their partner to considermoving to the South, where the participant grew up andwhereStateswould nowhave tomakemarriage available to them. “It’s a big dealwhen all the other statesare forced to get on board.”Distant from or not “for” a participant’s communityA Black queer woman in her 30s suggested that marriage seemed distant from her becauseshe was single when the Court announced its decision, she had gained a lot of weight,and she felt “undateable.” She elaborated: “It just feels like—it’s like [marriage is] overthere, and I’m over here. I’m over here trying to go on more than three dates withsomeone.”Family members’ reaction to marriage equality decisionsFew participants described their families’ reactions. Most family responses were positive,such as posting “Congratulations!” on Facebook. However, a White gender queer person inChicago recounted their parents sending a postcard congratulating them on getting married.Because the participant had a toxic relationship with their parents, “that promptly went in thetrash.”Just a means to a practical endThese comments described marriage as practically beneficial, but not driven by emotion. Forexample, a Black-Asian lesbian in New York City said that she might marry because of “theinheritance, taxes, things of that nature. Really sort of the mundane details, but they’re so, soimportant.” 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

ABlack transman inNewYorknoted:“Well, being that my gender mark has changed on my paperwork, if I wanted to get married, Ieasily can.”Other viewsWe used this category for comments that did not cleanly fit other categories. For instance, a Blackqueer man in New York City said that the decision did not impact him because he prefers to bealone: “I’m not necessarily pre-wired to be in relationships to be frank.”DISCUSSIONOur study yields several novel findings that call for further inquiry. Our findings with respect torace and ethnicity complicate broad claims about same-sex marriage not benefitting Black andLatinx people (Bailey et al., 2008). Our findings demonstrate that, even if White affluent peo-ple set the policy agenda that resulted in the availability of same-sex marriage, people of colorcould still reap benefits from this change in the legal and social landscape. Certain participantsdescribed the Court’s announcement of the right tomarry as leading tomore visibility of same-sexcouples, including role models for queer children, and enhancing the participants’ ability to fightstigma within institutions, such as their families of origin and religious institutions. Their livedexperiences suggest the broader equality ramifications of Obergefell.This finding is consistent with a pre-Obergefell study of Black LGB people, which concludedthat some participants regarded marriage as an opportunity to gain inclusion and status in theBlack community (Lee, 2018). While some have interpreted Black people’s interest in marriage asthe pursuit of “respectability” (Lee, 2020 & 2018), our findings indicate that some LGBTQ peo-ple of color see the benefits of the right to marry as substantial whether or not one exercises thatright by choosing to marry. Thus, these views challenge the effort to reduce marriage to simplerespectability. From this vantage point, a person of color who seeks to marry may not necessar-ily be seeking to assimilate into the broader, majority-White LGBTQ community, but rather mayconceive of marriage as a tool for battling stigma and creating greater space to live as an “out”sexual and/or gender minority in their community of color.Matsuda, a foundational CRT scholar, observes how people of color have often embraced andrenovated mainstream institutions, rather than simply mimic or absorb them: “This ability toadopt and transform standard texts andmainstreamconsciousness is an important contribution ofthose on the bottom. Black Americans, the paradigm victim group of our history, have turned theBible and the Constitution into texts of liberation.” (Matsuda, 1987). Perhaps some of our partici-pants had this history in mind in regarding marriage as valuable to them, despite the movement’stroubling racial politics. While some participants saw same-sex marriage as a form of assimi-lation, other participants seemed confident in their ability to transform the right, rather thanconform to mainstream forces in the heterosexual, cisgender community and the White LGBTQcommunity. 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseMARRIAGE EQUALITY & INTERSECTIONALITY 19As suggested by the above, some participants provided counternarratives that should givepause to scholars—particularly White scholars—who have crudely branded marriage equalityas a tool of White supremacy and suggested that people of color will not benefit from gainingaccess to marriage (Spade & Willse, 2013). A number of participants of color identified bene-fits that extend beyond their own marital status. These participants saw the affirmation of equalrights as encompassing their identities in various domains. These voices “from the bottom” cau-tion against the sweeping and decidedly negative views of marriage that are common in legalscholarship.To some extent, the divide between certain left-leaning scholars and our participants is remi-niscent of the debate between Critical Legal Studies (“CLS”) and Critical Race Theory (“CRT”)several decades ago. CLS scholars had “deconstructed” rights as unstable, indeterminate, and adelusion that masks power relations (Williams, 1987). Leading CRT scholars, including KimberléCrenshaw and Patricia Williams, pushed back against those who had “trashed” rights by explain-ing howmeaningful exercising rights was to African-Americans (Crenshaw et al., 1995, Williams,1987). From this vantage, rights may be “a source of agency, political empowerment, and a vehiclethrough which to effectuate resistance” (Carbado & Harris, 2019). Williams’s recommendationseems apt to the marriage context: “What is needed, therefore, is not the abandonment of rightslanguage for all purposes, but an attempt to becomemultilingual in the semantics of each other’s’rights-valuation” (Williams, 1987).There was some degree of variability in participants’ lived experiences and perspectives on themeaning of marriage in their own lives and for society more broadly. As reflected in the findingsreported in the results section, some identified the limits of marriage as a liberatory institution atthe same time that they voiced personal value in seeing their relationships recognized by societyor that others in the community could obtain this experience. This reflects findings from previousresearch reflecting the ways in which the individual and social meanings of marriage, intimacy,and the legal treatment of couple relationships vary tremendously among people (Cherlin, 2004).Second, our findings suggest further inquiry as to the role of scholars and activists in shapingviews of marriage. Several of our participants who most vocally objected to marriage used lan-guage that was quite reminiscent of scholarly and activist critiques. Scholars should reflect on theextent to which their views reflect those of marginalized sexual and gender minorities outsideof the academy. Some scholars might respond that the people in our sample are simply less edu-cated or less radical, but CRT scholarship suggests that scholars might learn from listening to theexperiences of those on the bottom.Third, legal scholars may find it important that some of our participants suggest a more robustunderstanding of Obergefell as an anti-subordination precedent. This is compatible with othersocial science research on same-sexmarriage (Lannutti, 2005). JusticeKennedy’sObergefellmajor-ity opinion focused primarily on due process and the importance of marriage. While some legalscholars have championed Obergefell as a landmark anti-subordination precedent (Tribe, 2004;Yoshino, 2015), other readings of the case have been more skeptical. The first three-quarters ofthe opinion’s legal analysis concentrated on due process. When Justice Kennedy finally turnedto equality, it was not to elaborate an independent Equal Protection Clause holding, as the Courtdid in Loving v. Virginia. Instead, the Court offered an essay on the intertwined nature of libertyand equality. Equality, for Justice Kennedy, appeared to be subordinate to the Court’s interest inliberty and “dignity.”But perhaps it is a mistake to be overly fixated on the text of the opinion. The voices in thisstudy may redirect one’s attention from Obergefell’s limits to the social and personal meaningsof the decision that individuals may create. Legal scholars have argued that Justice Kennedy’s 15302415, 0, Downloaded from https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/asap.12342 by University College London UCL Library Services, Wiley Online Library on [26/04/2023].

For many ofour participants,Obergefellwas primarily about equality, and they experienced it as an affirmationof their humanity irrespective of their current marital status or aspirations. This finding sug-gests that the court of public opinion may, in time, shed Justice Kennedy’s exclusionary rhetoricabout marriage serving as the only pathway to human happiness and civic belonging, and re-read Obergefell as centrally advancing equality for all. The ultimate impact of Obergefell mayturn less on Justice Kennedy’s precise words than on how ordinary people make meaning ofit.LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONThis qualitative research was done to understand the extent to which LGBTQ people, in partic-ular LGBTQ people of color, understand marriage equality and the marriage equality movementin the United States as impacting their lives. This research by no means should be considered sta-tistically generalizable to the entire LGBTQ population in the United States. However, the large,diverse, purposive sample reported in the present study is novel in its scale and diversity and thushas a high degree of theoretical generalizability (Fine, 2006). Additional limitations include thefocus on three cities, which reflect some degree of geographic variability, but likely underrepresentrural-living individuals and individuals from more potentially conservative regions of the UnitedStates (e.g., the South). Finally, our purposive sampling methods required participants to identifypublicly as LGBTQ at least within the research context, and thus our findings may not representthe lived experiences of people who are less “out” about their sexual and gender identities andpeople who are less connected to LGBTQ community and venues through which we recruitedparticipants.This research oversampled marginalized sexual and gender minority populations, includingpeople of color, transgender, and non-binary participants, to fill a gap in the literature on theright to marry (Reczec, 2020). Our participants perceived robust links between this newly con-ferred right and their ability to combat stigma of various sorts in domains that extend beyondmarriage. The study also shows the promise of deploying Critical Race Theory and intersectional-ity to uncover insights that challenge conventional narratives about the right to marry, includingthose promoted by the Supreme Court and prominent sexuality scholars.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSWe are thankful for research assistance by Jose Barragan, Lauren Broussard, Paris DeYoung,Anika Holland, Eric Jung, Su Li, Blair Matsuura, Monica Ramsy, Omi Salas-Santacruz, JeremySpence, and Ryan Whitacre.

    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to understand the extent to which a diverse group of sexual and gender minorities understood the landmark Supreme Court ruling in favor of marriage equality as personally impacting them. Prominent lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) figures have argued that marriage is an oppressive institution and that legalizing same-sex marriage would not benefit the most marginalized members of the community, particularly Black people. Until now, there have been few resources for comparing these claims of scholars and activists with those of members of the communities they claim to represent. Guided by Critical Race Theory and intersectionality, this study centered LGBTQ people of color's lived experiences. A purposive sample of 99 LGBTQ people in Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco were asked whether and how the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) personally impacted them. Most participants described an emotional impact. Relatively few criticized marriages as “heteronormative” or unfit for LGBTQ people. Black participants were less likely than participants of other races to criticize marriage as an institution. Moreover, Black and Latinx participants articulated a more expansive, equality-focused understanding of the right to marry than the Court itself articulated. They described the marriage decision as carrying the potential to empower and elevate their identities in various contexts. For these people, the marriage equality movement was centrally about equality rather than marriage",
