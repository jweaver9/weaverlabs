When a parentscolds a child on the playground, all eyes turn to watch and judge. When an execu-tive's wife hosts a work party, the guests are witness to traditional gender roles. Andwhen two fathers attend a back-to-school night for their child, other parents takenote of this relatively new family configuration. Family is popularly consideredintimate and personal, but in reality much of family life is lived in the public eye.These performances of family and familial roles do not simply communicatemessages to others. They are also central to the deep structure of family law.Drawing on sociological and feminist theory, this Article argues that iterated,everyday performances are performative-that is, they create and then maintaincollective understandings of mother, father, child, and family itself The law playsan integral role in this by imbuing the performances with legal salience to define thecategories at the heart of family law. This Article terms this dynamic process\"performative family law.\"Aspects of this mutually constitutive relationship between performance and familylaw are deeply troubling, raising significant concerns for core areas of doctrine,policy, and theory. First, family law's prevailing approach to defining familial cate-gories is normatively narrowing because legal actors tend to give effect only totraditional, dominant images of the family despite seismic demographic changes infamily form. Second, the obscuring effects of the public face of the family oftenwarp the policies designed to address family violence, most notably child sexualabuse. Finally, by ignoring the pressure of performance, scholarly debates over thepublic-private divide are incomplete and have failed to explain why the concept offamily privacy retains such enormous appeal.In response, this Article proposes a new framework for family law that decentersdominant performances and provides an alternative means to define familial cate-gories and counter family violence. It is not possible or even desirable to eliminateperformativity entirely, but it is important to resist its more troubling aspects. Adenaturalizing framework promises a more pluralistic approach to the emergingdemographic transformation of the family and deeper engagement with the varietyof family life today.* Copyright @ 2013 by Clare Huntington, Associate Professor, Fordham Law School;J.D., Columbia Law School; B.A., Oberlin College.

Judgmentsare forming by the second, and the parent knows it. We tend to thinkof parenting as personal and private, but, like so many aspects offamily life, it plays out on a larger stage.This insight resonates viscerally for anyone who has ever built aFacebook page or hosted a holiday gathering. Performances-con-scious and unconscious-permeate every aspect of family life, con-stantly sending both overt and subtle messages to others about familyand familial roles.' Reflecting sociological and feminist theory, theseperformances can be understood as performative. 2 That is, repeated,everyday familial performances constitute and then reinforce the cate-gories of father, mother, child, spouse, and family itself. People knowwhat a mother is from watching mothers perform. Feminist theoristJudith Butler famously argued that gender is not a natural, stable cate-gory but rather \"a compelling illusion,\" constructed through a seriesof acts.3 This is equally true, if often more obscured, for a range offamilial categories.This process, in which repeated performances create and rein-force meaningful roles, is not just a phenomenon on the playground,but also plays an important role in courtrooms, legislatures, and gov-ernment agencies. When legal institutions decide whether same-sexcouples should be allowed to marry,4 whether sperm and egg donors1 This Article uses \"performance\" to refer to family-related behavior that has a com-municative effect on others and on the self. See ERVING GOFFMAN, THE PRESENTATION OFSELF IN EVERYDAY LIFE 15, 79 (1959) (defining performance to include \"all the activity ofa given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of theother participants,\" and further noting that both individuals and \"team[s]\" perform).Performances can be conscious, contrived, and intended for consumption, such as when apolitical candidate takes the stage, accompanied by a warm and smiling wife and happy,well-dressed children. Often, however, performances are not conscious, contrived, orintended for a broader audience, such as when a mother breastfeeds her hungry child on apark bench. For an extended discussion of the conduct that qualifies as familial perform-ance, as well as a description of conduct that is not performance, see infra Part II.B.1.2 As discussed infra in Part IA, the linguistic philosopher J.L. Austin definedperformativity as words that create, rather than simply describe, a reality-as illustrated inthe difference between saying \"I do\" rather than \"I am married.\" J.L. AUsTIN, How TODo THINGS WITH WORDS 5 (J.O. Urmson & Marina Sbish eds., 2d ed. 1975). Feministphilosopher Judith Butler, among others, uses the term \"performativity\" more broadly.

When the lesbian partner of abiological mother seeks parental rights, for example, courts invoke thecollective image-what Erving Goffman called the \"social front\" 7-ofmotherhood.8 The court compares the would-be mother's perform-ance with the dominant social front, scrutinizing such details aswhether the mother received a Mother's Day card or picked thechild's pediatrician. 9 If the would-be mother has acted like a conven-tional mother, then she is a mother, legally speaking. This Articleterms this process-of drawing on dominant performances to shapelegal categories-\"performative family law.\"10To surface the constitutive relationship between law and perform-ance is immediately to appreciate its normatively troubling effects.Performances may vary, but only some have legal uptake, and the lawtends to enshrine traditional social fronts.

This Article does not address therole of performance in every aspect of family law, and instead chooses several illustrativecontexts. A particularly fruitful path that this Article does not follow, for example, is therole of performance in the legal recognition of families with transgendered members.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

Two out of five children are born to unmarriedparents,13 cohabitation rates continue to rise steadily as marriage ratesdecline, 14 same-sex couples are far more visible than at any time in thepast,15 and assisted reproductive technology has opened the door tomyriad familial configurations. 1 6 When the state decides who is afamily and who is not, considerable tangible and intangible benefitshang in the balance.17 Despite the accelerating reality of change in the11 See infra Part III.A.2.12 Unlike courts and legislatures, legal scholars usually recognize that family andfamilial roles are not preordained, natural categories. See, e.g., MARTHA ALBERTSONFINEMAN, THE AUTONOMY MYTH: A THEORY OF DEPENDENCY 36-37 (2004) (arguingthat the social construction of the traditional family, consisting of a male breadwinner anddependent wife and children, is responsible for the exploitation of women and the priva-tizing of dependency); Nancy D.

What is missing is aclear understanding of the mechanism through which naturalized understandings are repli-cated. This Article develops such an account.13 The national rate of nonmarital births is forty-one percent. Joyce Martin et al.,Births: Final Data for 2009, 60 NAT'L VITAL STATISTICs REPORTS, Nov. 3, 2011, no. 1, at 1,8 (2011). In some communities, the rate of nonmarital births is even higher. Seventy-threepercent of all African American children and fifty-three percent of Latino children areborn to unmarried parents.

Law Review593May 2013]1NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWAmerican family, family law continues to instantiate narrow socialfronts and naturalized categories.Understanding family law in performative terms has significantconsequences for doctrine, policy, and theoretical debates about thefamily. First, it casts serious doubt on the law's approach to nontradi-tional families.' 8 The success of marriage equality, for example, hasturned on the ability of same-sex couples to persuade legal deci-sionmakers that couples seeking legal recognition fit easily within thesocial front of traditional nuclear families, with lesbians held out assoccer moms and gay men as ball-throwing dads.19 This normativenarrowing is also on display in one of the most important contempo-rary family law reform efforts, the American Law Institute's (ALI)Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution (the Principles).20 In awell-intentioned effort, the ALI's Principles assimilate nontraditionalfamilies into family law, but do so by requiring those asserting legalrights to act in ways that reflect dominant performances. 21 Familieswho do not fit within the familiar and iconic model are inherently sus-pect and less likely to win legal recognition. Although the ALI hastaken a laudable step forward, it is important to question the means ofrecognition.Second, conceiving of family law in performative terms has impli-cations for the formulation of policies addressing family violence.Public performances of family tend to be a soft focus, portraying fami-lies as rich sites of affective ties. As the saying goes, \"home is wherethe heart is.\" This vision may be an important social aspiration, but itobscures the dark corners of violence, abuse, and power imbalances,as well as the quotidian emotional slights, misattunements, and ambiv-alence that mark family life. Family law's reliance on performancemisses the violence that happens just offstage, skewing policy18 See infra Parts III.B.1, III.C.1.19 See, e.g., Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 872 (Iowa 2009) (\"Like most Iowans,[plaintiffs] are responsible, caring, and productive individuals. They maintain importantjobs, or are retired, and are contributing, benevolent members of their communities. ...Like many Iowans, some have children and others hope to have children.

Law Review594 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYresponses, particularly in the area of child sexual abuse.Overwhelmingly positive images of family contribute to a collectivecognitive dissonance, as parents and policymakers continue toapproach child sexual abuse as a problem of strangers lurking in theshadows, rather than acknowledging the much greater risk presentedby family members and friends.Finally, understanding family law in performative terms shedsnew light on one of the central debates in family law theory: thepublic-private divide. Scholars have long worked to undercut the pre-vailing myth that families are private, standing apart from the state.22But claims of family privacy remain viscerally appealing, and here,too, the role of performance has explanatory heft. Families with suffi-cient means to have private space may experience the home as a placeto suspend performance. Although it is not possible to do so entirely,the belief that one can take off the wig and costume holds tremendousallure. When limited-government advocates call for keeping the stateout of the home, it resonates at least in part because of a belief thatthe home is, and should be, free of performance. If scholarly criticsand others better understood the instinctive appeal of family privacy,they could develop more effective strategies for overcoming the falsepublic-private dichotomy.To respond to the pernicious effects of performative family law,this Article proposes a new framework for denaturalizing family law.23Stepping outside of performance completely is impossible, and notnecessarily desirable, but it is possible to decenter the valence of dom-inant performances in doctrine and policy. This Article identifies theessential components of a denaturalizing framework: (1) adoptingbroader social fronts, (2) developing alternative means for definingfamilial categories, and (3) rejecting demands for contrived perform-ances. This framework leads to more pluralistic definitions of familialcategories and policies that are more responsive to family violence.Performance and performativity are well recognized by scholarsin a range of fields. Indeed, there is now an entire field of perform-ance studies. 24 Legal scholars have fruitfully applied performancetheory to important aspects of identity and discrimination, 25 but22 See infra Part III.C.3 (describing this literature).23 See infra Part IV.24 The interdisciplinary field of performance studies is not unified by methodology butrather draws on multiple perspectives to deepen an understanding of the phenomenon. SeeBarbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Performance Studies, in THE PERFORMANCE STUDIESREADER 43 (Henry Bial ed., 2d ed. 2007) (\"Performance Studies starts with a set of con-cerns and objects and ranges widely for what it needs by way of theory and method.\").25 See, e.g., Devon W. Carbado & Mitu Gulati, Working Identity, 85 CORNELL L. REV.1259, 1262, 1267-79 (2000) (contending that \"outsider group\" members have to performImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 595NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWengagement has been conspicuously absent in scholarly assessments ofthe law's treatment of the family.26 This is all the more remarkablegiven the centrality of performance and performativity in family lifeand family law. This Article remedies this lacuna by developing a the-oretical frame for understanding the performative dynamic of familylaw and providing an alternative to the normatively troubling relianceon performative categories.To develop these insights, the Article proceeds in four parts. PartI provides an overview of performance theory and the legal scholar-ship that has drawn on this literature outside of family law. Part IIexplores the ubiquity of familial performances, identifying the manyways families perform in everyday life and in popular culture. Part IIIturns to the insights that flow from conceiving of family law inperformative terms, arguing that the law's current uncritical incorpo-ration of dominant performances obscures nontraditional families andundermines responses to familial violence. Finally, Part IV proposestheir identities to counter negative stereotypes and that \"the nature of the work and thepressure to do it . . . is a form of employment discrimination\"); Camille Gear Rich,Performing Racial and Ethnic Identity: Discrimination by Proxy and the Future of Title VII,79 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1134, 1158-59 (2004) (explaining that employers develop performanceexpectations for certain races and ethnic groups, including specific hairstyles, accents, andclothing styles). This literature is described in greater detail in Part I.B, infra.26 When scholars do note the role of performance in family law, they typically do so inpassing and tend to focus on race, sexual orientation, and gender. See, e.g., Katherine M.Franke, Taking Care, 76 CHI.-KENT L. REV. 1541, 1553-54 (2001) (describing how newlyfreed slaves during the Reconstruction Era had to perform marriage consistent with Whitenorms as a condition of being recognized as citizens). One notable exception is ArielaDubler's legal history of common law marriage. See Ariela R. Dubler, Wifely Behavior: ALegal History of Acting Married, 100 COLUM. L. REV. 957, 962-67, 1006-13 (2000) (dem-onstrating that in the early twentieth century the line between marriage and nonmarriagewas far more permeable than commonly thought, that legal norms did not neatly reflectsocial norms and instead were a means for imposing judicial order in the face of ambiguityabout what kinds of behavior counted as marriage, that the legal and social conceptions ofmarriage were heavily infused with changing gender norms, and that common law mar-riage was rejected at least in part because it could be reduced to a series of social perform-ances, thus risking the exposure of all marriages as mere performance); see also Jessica A.Clarke, Adverse Possession of Identity: Radical Theory, Conventional Practice, 84 OR. L.REV. 563, 570-83 (2005) (exploring circumstances in which the law confers legal benefitson a person acting as if they had a certain legal status-such as that of property owner-bycomparing adverse possession, common law marriage, functional parenthood, and 19thcentury doctrines of race determination); Marc R.

JusT. 3 (2008) (examining the role of \"microperformances\"-the identity-formingand identity-altering aspects of social interaction-in the same-sex marriage debate). Inother fields, however, there is a closer treatment of performance and family categories. See,e.g., ROBIN BERNSTEIN, RACIAL INNOCENCE: PERFORMING AMERICAN CHILDHOOD FROMSLAVERY TO CIVIL RIGHTS (2011) (using performance theory to examine theater produc-tions, works of literature, and playthings, particularly dolls, to argue that until the civilrights movement, only White children were understood as innocent).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

ThisPart focuses on sociologist Erving Goffman and feminist philosopherJudith Butler, whose works are central to performance theory andsupply a useful framework for understanding performance and familylaw. As this Part describes, legal scholars have drawn upon perform-ance literature to gain insights into the legal effect of the performanceof race, sexual orientation, and gender, but they have not engaged in asimilar exploration of the performance of family.A. Theoretical AntecedentsIn the 1955 William James Lectures at Harvard University, lin-guistic philosopher J.L. Austin outlined different aspects of speech. 27He contrasted constative speech with performative speech, arguingthat the former describes a reality while the latter creates a reality.2 8 \"Iam married\" is constative speech; saying \"I do\" in a marriage cere-mony is performative speech.29 The words \"I do\" create the mar-riage.30 Austin understood these types of speech as overlapping,rather than distinct categories, because a set of words could be one orthe other depending on the context.3 ' As Austin elaborated, wordshave consequence because of the conventions surrounding their utter-ance.32 The words \"I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth\" are27 The lectures were subsequently published. See AUSTIN, supra note 2.28 See id. at 3-7.29 See id.; see also id. at 12 (\"[T]o say something is to do something . . .30 See id. at 4-6. Austin refined the category of performative speech into \"illocutio-nary\" utterances, which \"do\" something directly, such as saying \"I do,\" and \"perlocutio-nary\" utterances, which \"do\" something indirectly by having an effect on others, such assaying \"shoot her.\" Id. at 98-108. Although this Article does not hew closely to Austin'sdefinition of performativity, which focuses on speech, the distinction is still relevant. Somefamilial performances do directly affect familial categories, as with a wedding ceremony ora mother giving birth, but the primary focus of this Article is the effect of familial perform-ances on others.31 See id. at 4-9.32 Austin identified six \"felicity conditions,\" which are required for an utterance to beperformative, including \"an accepted conventional procedure\" for \"the uttering of certainwords by certain persons in certain circumstances.\" Id. at 14-15. One of J.L. Austin'sImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 597NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWperformative only when said in a ship-naming ceremony, and thenonly because of the tradition of naming ships.33Austin's insights provide a kernel for understanding a muchbroader phenomenon. Performance permeates daily life and isperformative in the sense that it has actual consequences. The use ofdramaturgical analogies-referring to roles, scripts, and perform-ances-to understand social interactions is not new, but in the last halfof the twentieth century, the field has developed, taking a more sys-tematic and constructional approach. 341. PerformanceA leading figure in performance theory, Erving Goffman's partic-ular insight was that much of daily life is performed. As he put it,\"[t]he world, in truth, is a wedding.\"35 Drawing on symbolic interac-tionism-which teaches that individuals' behavior constructs societythrough a particular process of creating shared meaning 36-Goffmandeveloped the dramaturgical analogy to understand the formation ofidentity. As he described in his seminal book, The Presentation of Selfin Everyday Life, Goffman used the perspective of a theatrical per-formance to study how individuals in the workplace presentstudents, John Searle, developed the idea of context further, focusing particularly on theeffect of institutional context in conveying meaning. Searle contended that simplydescribing a set of facts may have little meaning without a larger understanding of institu-tional practices. For example, to say that a woman in a dress walked a short distance nextto one man and then joined another man has no particular meaning. But once these factsare conveyed as part of the institution of the traditional wedding ceremony, the acts takeon meaning. See JOHN R. SEARLE, SPEECH ACrs: AN ESSAY IN THE PHILOSOPHY OFLANGUAGE 50-53 (1969).33 See AUSTIN, supra note 2, at 5, 8, 14-24. As the marriage example illustrates, Austinwas aware of the legal consequences of some speech, but legal significance was not thehallmark of his performativity-rather, the social convention that accompanied the speechwas the dispositive feature.34 See, e.g., CLIFFORD GEERTZ, LOCAL KNOWLEDGE: FURTHER ESSAYS ININTERPRETIVE ANTHROPOLOGY 26-27 (1983) (deploying performance to develop anthro-pological theory); VIcTOR TURNER, DRAMAS, FIELDS, AND METAPHORS: SYMBOLICACION IN HUMAN SOCIETY 37-42 (1974) (describing how individuals' actions create spacefor societal conflicts to be laid bare and addressed, leading to the restructuring of socialdynamics).35 GoFFMAN, supra note 1, at 36.36 See HERBERT BLUMER, SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONISM: PERSPECTIVE AND METHOD1-6 (1969). In symbolic interactionism, the self is an object and its meaning to an individualis mediated through social interactions. See id. at 2, 12. To become an object to oneself, it isnecessary to be outside the self. This is where performance enters. If an individual placesherself in the position of others-thus, taking a role-then she is able to see herself anddevelop a sense of self. See id. at 13.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

The frontincludes the setting39 and the performer's \"personal front,\" which arethose characteristics and props that follow the performer every-where. 40 The \"back\" is that which the audience is not meant to seeand is where the performance is prepared. 41Individual performances are related to what he called the \"socialfront,\" the shorthand that performers use to help orient the audienceto the general meaning of a performance. 42 When professionals in dis-parate fields wear white laboratory coats, they can convey a generalmessage of cleanliness and modernity to the audience without fleshingout the details of precisely how this particular professional is cleanand modern.43Goffman contended that social fronts become institutionalized,making it difficult for an individual performer to alter the meaning ofthe front. When an individual assumes an established social role,according to Goffman, she will find that there is a well-establishedsocial front in place for that role and that she must maintain both thetasks associated with the role as well as the social front.44 In otherwords, the academic must publish or perish, but also wear tweed.37 See GOFFMAN, supra note 1, at xi. There are numerous criticisms of Goffman's dram-aturgical approach, including Herbert Blumer's contention that Goffman focused too nar-rowly on face-to-face interactions without considering the broader social context or otherways humans interact. See Herbert Blumer, Action vs. Interaction, 9 SOCIETY, Apr. 1972, at50, 52 (reviewing ERVING GOFFMAN, RELATIONS IN PUBLIC: MICROSTUDIES OF THEPUBLIC ORDER (1971)). Goffman himself was aware of the limits of his analogy. SeeGOFFMAN, supra note 1, at xi, 254 (describing \"obvious inadequacies\" of his model, such asthe fact that the stage presents things that are make-believe while presumably life presentsthings that are real, and the fact that in a performance the audience creates a third partyapart from the characters, whereas in real life the other characters are also the audience).See generally BRUCE WILSHIRE, ROLE PLAYING AND IDENTITY xiv-xvii, 258-81 (1982)(arguing that Goffman and others use the theatrical metaphor too simplistically becausethey conflate too many aspects of the actor and also cast doubt on the existence of a trueself and of reality itself).38 GOFFMAN, supra note 1, at 208.39 A person who wants to convey her elevated social status, for example, will ensurethat others see her surrounded by luxurious furnishings.

The performer maintainsthe ideal by engaging in discrepant behavior on the sly, 4 7 and the audi-ence agrees not to pull back the curtain on the performance. 4 8To present an idealized self, performers engage in numeroussmall deceptions, such as correcting mistakes before the performanceto create an impression of infallibility, showing only the end productof labor to conceal either the cursory or laborious work that went onbehind the scenes, and hiding any dirty work that went into the per-formance, including degrading or semi-illegal actions. 4 9 Crucially, theperformer keeps the audience out of the back.Goffman resisted a dichotomy between real and contrived per-formances, contending that even \"real\" performances may be con-trived-\"while persons usually are what they appear to be, suchappearances could still have been managed.\"50 Thus, Goffman positeda continuum, with sincere performances at one end, where the per-former truly believes in her performance, and cynical performances atthe other end, where the performer does not believe in her perform-ance.5' Goffman argued that performers often traverse this45 The \"self\" is a complicated and contested notion. Scholars across disciplines havelong debated different conceptions of the self and whether the self is knowable. See, e.g.,JEAN PAUL SARTRE, BEING AND NOTHINGNESS 82-83 (1943) (setting forth his waiterexample, where the waiter is playing at being a waiter and thus transcends his socialstatus). See generally THE BOOK OF THE SELF: PERSON, PRETEXT, AND PROCEss (PollyYoung-Eisendrath & James A. Hall eds., 1987) (presenting a collection of views on thenature of the self, including self as person, self as pretext, and self as process). Some of thescholars discussed in this Article would take serious issue with the idea of a knowable self,especially Judith Butler. See JUDITH BUTLER, GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF ONESELF 19-21,37-40 (2005) (arguing that the self is always partially hidden, \"not only because the bodyhas a formative history that remains irrecoverable by reflection, but because primary rela-tions are formative in ways that produce a necessary opacity in our understanding of our-selves\"). In describing different conceptions of the self, this Article acknowledges theimpossibility of ever fully knowing the self-of having an irreducibly authentic identity-but it also assumes that it is possible to divine a sense of self, at least as a felt experience ifnot an absolute truth.46 See GOFFMAN, supra note 1, at 35-36.47 See id. at 41 (\"[I]n this way the performer is able to forgo his cake and eat it too.\").48 See id. at 229-33 (setting forth the numerous ways audience members collude inmaintaining the illusion of the performance, including not insisting on seeing the \"back,\"pretending not to see any slips in the performance that would reveal the discrepancybetween performance and reality, and so on).49 See id. at 43-46.50 Id. at 71.51 Id. at 17-18.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

An individual may begin with a cynical performance butultimately come to believe it, or conversely, begin by believing theperformance to be true but then lose such faith over time.52Finally, Goffman was interested in the ways performances definemembership and exclude others. For example, he noted that eventhough pharmacists do not require extensive training, sustaining theperformance of elaborate graduate training is a way of maintainingpharmacists' social and economic status.53 In this way, performancescan define who is \"in,\" but also, crucially, who is \"out.\"2. PerformativityThe consequence of performance is what some scholars callperformativity. 54 This can be narrow in the Austinian sense of aspeech act but can also be much broader in the sense that perform-ances create social categories. A foundational scholar in this vein isJudith Butler, who studies the social construction of gender identity.According to Butler, gender is socially constructed through a series ofperformative, iterative acts.5 5 To Butler, \"bodily gestures, movements,and enactments of various kinds constitute the illusion of an abidinggendered self.\"56 The performance is so convincing that both the52 Id. at 19-21.53 See id. at 46.54 The exact relationship between performativity and performance remains contested.See Andrew Parker & Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Introduction to PERFORMATIVITY ANDPERFORMANCE 2 (Andrew Parker & Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick eds., 1995) (noting that theword \"performative,\" despite being a \"common lexical . .. term,\" can have vastly differentand even oppositional meanings in different contexts).55 See JUDITH BUTLER, BODIES THAT MATTER: ON THE DISCURSIVE LIMITS OF \"SEX\"2 (1993) [hereinafter BUTLER, BODIES THAT MATTER] (discussing \"the reiterative and cita-tional practice by which discourse produces the effects that it names\"); Butler, supra note3, at 519 (outlining an idea of gender as \"an identity instituted through a stylized repetitionof acts\"); see also BUTLER, BODIES THAT MATTER, supra, at 12 (\"Performativity is thus nota singular 'act,' for it is always a reiteration of a norm or set of norms, and to the extentthat it acquires an act-like status in the present, it conceals or dissimulates the conventionsof which it is a repetition.\"). For more discussion of this theory, see generally JUDITHBUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE: FEMINISM AND THE SUBVERSION OF IDENTITY (1990) [herein-after BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE]. Jacques Derrida also explored this broader under-standing of performative acts and the idea that repeated acts construct an identity. SeeJACOUES DERRIDA, Signature Event Context, in MARGINS OF PHILOSOPHY 307, 307-30(Alan Bass trans., 1982).56 Butler, supra note 3, at 519. The reproduction of a gendered identity occurs throughthe reenactment of certain bodily actions against the backdrop of gendered expectationsand bodily styles. See id. at 521-24. Butler uses a broad understanding of an \"act\" toinclude political and social acts as well. See id. at 523. In Butler's theory, the body is centralto performativity. Because biological sex is located in the body, Butler contends that it iscrucial that a gendered identity reside in the body as well, with gender as \"the culturalsignificance that the sexed body assumes ..... \" Id. at 524.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review601May 2013]NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWactors and the audience do not perceive the performance but insteadsee only the fact of gender.57There is, however, some awareness of construction. Butler con-tends that the anxiety that attends gender performances-whengender is not performed properly, society is quick to sanction ormarginalize the actor-is \"sign enough that on some level there issocial knowledge that the truth or falsity of gender is only sociallycompelled and in no sense ontologically necessitated.\" 58 There is alsothe possibility of subversion, as Butler illustrates with the example ofmen in drag: Through such performances, the performers \"mock[ ] ...the expressive model of gender and the notion of a true genderidentity. \"59Although gender performances are individual, they are also col-lective. As Butler argues, \"there are nuanced and individual ways ofdoing one's gender, but that one does it, and that one does it in accordwith certain sanctions and proscriptions, is clearly not a fully indi-vidual matter.\" 60 The performances take on a public nature becausethe acts both come from collective experience and recreate collectiveexperience. 61In essence, Goffman and Butler both describe how perform-ances-which are ubiquitous, permeating the self and society in far-reaching ways-can also be performative, doing significant social, cul-tural, and political work to create meaning. This is seen in Butler'scontention that gender does not exist in a natural state but rather iscreated through iterative acts. It is also reflected in the symbolic-interactionist insight that there is no preexisting meaning that individ-uals express, but rather through interaction, meaning is formed.6 2Goffman and Butler, however, are not an easy pairing, largelybecause of their different views about agency and the effect of per-formance. For Goffman, the actor typically chooses to perform andthe performance has a beginning and an end.6 3 The back is a57 See id. at 520, 527.58 Id. at 528.59 BUTLER, GENDER TROUBLE, supra note 55, at 136-38.60 Butler, supra note 3, at 525.61 Id. at 525-26.62 See BLUMER, supra note 36, at 10 (\"By virtue of symbolic interaction, human grouplife is necessarily a formative process and not a mere arena for the expression of pre-existing factors.\"); id. at 19 (\"It is the social process in group life that creates and upholdsthe rules, not the rules that create and uphold group life.\"). Of particular relevance to thisArticle is the symbolic-interactionist insight that the meaning of a \"thing\" is neither fixednor entirely subjective, but instead comes from an interpretive process; in short, meaningsare social products. See id. at 5.63 Goffman did acknowledge that some performances are unconscious. See GOFFMAN,supra note 1, at 6 (explaining that sometimes \"the individual will act in a thoroughlyImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review602 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYperformance-free zone. By contrast, Butler's understanding of per-formance is that the act constitutes the self and thus posits a distinctlack of agency.6 4 There is no self to precede the performance, andthere cannot be a back of the performance.Although these divergent conceptions of the self underscore thelack of a unitary theory, Goffman and Butler are best understood aspresenting different moments of the self. Gender may be a reality onlybecause iterative acts shape the concept of gender, but in a societywhere gender is salient, individuals still make conscious choices, atleast at the margins, about how to perform gender.Moreover, individuals certainly perceive some agency. Thefamiliar expressions of \"knowing yourself\" and having a \"true self\" oran \"inner self\" reflect a perception that there is an authentic identitythat is, at least partially, knowable. Butler and others have claimedthat any perception of an authentic self is delusional, but there aremany times when we feel that we are stepping out of the scene, aswhen we may \"debrief\" with a co-worker or family member about aworrisome incident.65Notwithstanding these conceptual tensions, Goffman and Butlerboth reflect an important insight into social construction. As the nextcalculating manner,\" whereas other times the individual may be calculating but is unawareof it or may act in a certain manner because of habit and societal expectations). ToGoffman, these variations were less important than the ultimate effect of the audienceacting as though it believed the performance, in which case the performance can be consid-ered effective. See id.64 See BUTLER, BODIES THAT MATTER, supra note 55, at 15 (arguing that her accountof performativity \"in no way presupposes a choosing subject\"); see also id. at x (arguingthat if gender were performative, this \"could mean that I thought that one woke up in themorning, perused the closet or some more open space for the gender of choice, donnedthat gender for the day, and then restored the garment to its place at night,\" but \"[s]uch awillful and instrumental subject, one who decides on its gender, is clearly not its genderfrom the start and fails to realize that its existence is already decided by gender\"). In thisway, Butler does not conceive of gender as a role that one assumes, but rather as an actthat creates the subject itself. See Butler, supra note 3, at 528. Butler then addresses theexistential question begged by this analysis: What came before the subject, or who is doingthe constructing? See BUTLER, BODIES THAT MATTER, supra note 55, at x-xi. She contendsthat we can answer this question only by rethinking the idea of construction itself. See id. atxi, 7 (\"Subjected to gender but subjectivated by gender, the 'I' neither precedes nor followsthe process of this gendering, but emerges only within and as the matrix of gender relationsthemselves.\").65 This Article thus uses both conceptions of performance-as a conscious act deployedto influence others and as a constitutive act that precedes any sense of self. To translate thisinto the context of families, families and familial roles exist only through performances, butindividuals and families as a whole still choose to act in certain ways to influence how theyare perceived by others. As described in greater detail in Part III, performative family lawdraws more on a Butlerian understanding of performance, but Goffman's concept ofchosen performances is also relevant to how individuals try to fit within, and change, familylaw's categories.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 603NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWSubpart demonstrates, legal scholars have drawn upon these insightsto identify the role of law in performance and performativity.B. Performance and Identity in Legal ScholarshipLegal scholars have relied on performance theory to develop sub-stantive insights into identity and discrimination. 66 For example,Devon Carbado and Mitu Gulati have developed a theory about iden-tity performance, positing that although a person's \"status identity\"(such as gender and race) informs experiences with, and vulnerabilityto, discrimination, \"performance identity\"-the choices a personmakes about how to present their status-has distinct legal signifi-cance.67 Carbado and Gulati give the example of African Americanwomen, whose decisions about hairstyles, clothing, and leisure activi-ties have significant meaning in our race-conscious culture.68 If anemployer promotes one African American woman but not another,this decision may well turn on the performance choices of eachemployee. The employer may prefer the African American womanwho relaxes her hair, wears khakis on casual Fridays, and plays tennisat a country club, rather than the woman who has her hair in braids,wears West African-influenced dress on Fridays, and does not belongto a country club. 69 But, as Carbado and Gulati argue, antidiscrimina-tion law considers only status discrimination-whether the employerdiscriminated against African American women-not identity-performance discrimination, and thus the second woman has no claimunder existing antidiscrimination law.7066 In the literature discussed in this Subpart, there is a tension about whether perform-ances require individual agency. At times, scholars appear to assume that the performancesare consciously chosen. The image of a worker deciding how to perform her race andgender in the workplace is more akin to Goffman's sense that individuals manage theimpression they are making and is in stark contrast with Butler's belief that gender pre-cedes the subject. Other times, scholars seem to adopt Butler's approach and conceive ofperformance as creating the category itself, as with the social construction of race in thenineteenth century racial identity trials.67 See Devon W. Carbado & Mitu Gulati, The Fifth Black Woman, 11 J. CONTEMP.LEGAL ISSUEs 701, 701-03, 710-19 (2001) (discussing and applying these concepts of statusidentity and performance identity); see also Carbado & Gulati, supra note 25, at 1263-67(discussing the difficult decisions employees face when employers appear to value attrib-utes that are hard to observe-such as collegiality-but such attributes conflict with theemployee's sense of self, such as when an employee is shy).68 Carbado & Gulati, supra note 67, at 717-18.69 Id.70 See id. at 719-28. Carbado and Gulati argue that identity performances are particu-larly important in workplaces where the standards for advancement are difficult to quan-tify and turn on such factors as \"social effort\" and \"collegiality.\" Carbado & Gulati, supranote 25, at 1260-61, 1263. In that context, an incentive exists for employees to \"work theiridentities\" to signal to the employer that they have the desired characteristics and thuscounter negative stereotypes about an employee's status identity. See id. at 1260-63. OneImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review604 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYLegal scholars also have used performance theory to help under-stand the social construction of race.7 ' A legal history of nineteenth-century racial identity trials demonstrates the performative aspect ofrace. 72 The issue of racial identity arose in different contexts, such aswhether a slave should be set free or whether a person could legallyinherit or devise property, a right that only Whites could exercise. 73The trials embodied twin anxieties of the time: the fear that a Whiteperson might be enslaved and the fear that a Black person might be\"passing\" as White.74 The trial did not turn simply on ancestry.Instead, parties litigating racial identity introduced evidence about thephysical appearance of the person in question and about the conductof the person.75 If a person acted in a way that was understood asWhite or Black, then a jury was more likely to determine that theperson was White or Black.76 To \"act White\" had a specific meaning.For men, it meant civic participation, such as voting or sitting on ajury, and for women, it meant acting honorably, both sexually andsocially.77 In this way, race was performative in the sense that it meantnot just what someone looked like, but also how they acted inpublic.78protection in this regard is that it is not permissible for employers to use stereotypes abouta protected group to make an employment decision. See, e.g., Back v. Hastings on HudsonSch. Dist., 365 F.3d 107, 121-22 (2d Cir. 2004) (holding that \"stereotyping of women ascaregivers can by itself and without more be evidence of an impermissible, sex-basedmotive\"); see also Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 734 (2003) (findingthat family responsibility stereotypes justified the Family and Medical Leave Act). Finally,Carbado and Gulati argue that employment discrimination law recognizes neither the tan-gible nor psychic costs of performance identity. As they contend, individuals incur realcosts from the time and effort it takes to perform, a cost not borne by in-group membersbecause they are not working against negative stereotypes. See Carbado & Gulati, supranote 25, at 1279-88. And individuals incur psychic costs from the need to deny the self inorder to fit in. See id. at 1288-90.71 See, e.g., IAN F.

When a female law student who is alsoa parent asked for advice about an upcoming clerkship interview, aprofessor cautioned, \"don't front the kid to the judge.\"8 3 The demandof the law student was not that she become a man or pass herself offas a man, but rather that she cover her gender and act more like onecultural image of a man, which is to say, someone without significantchildcare responsibilities.Yoshino uses his insights into covering to argue that the lawshould move away from a norm of group-based equality because thisapproach essentializes certain traits and assumes that they are centralto that group.84 Instead, Yoshino argues, civil rights law should bebased on a universal right of elaborating a true, individual identity.8579 See KENJI YOSHINO, COVERING: THE HIDDEN AsSAULT ON OUR CIVIL RIGHTS(2006). Goffman first coined the term \"covering\" to describe the process an individual usesto downplay a stigmatized part of her identity. See ERVING GoFFMAN, STIGMA: NOTES ONTHE MANAGEMENT OF SPOILED IDENTITY 102-04 (1963). In Yoshino's words, covering \"isto tone down a disfavored identity to fit into the mainstream.\" YosHINO, supra, at ix.80 See YOSHINO, supra note 79, at 19.81 See YOSHINo, supra note 79, at 17-19.

An African American man, for example,may face fears that he is a physical and sexual threat, leading some toact in deliberate ways. The journalist and writer Brent Staplesexplains that as a tall African American male, he will whistle Vivaldias he walks down a city street at night, reassuring White passersbythat he is not a threat.87 And class affects all performances. AfricanAmericans who have grown up in the middle class, for example, canrecount the demands to act differently from lower-income AfricanAmericans.88Familial status and familial roles are no less social identities thanrace and gender, and yet scholars have not examined the role of per-formance in family law.89 As the remainder of this Article demon-strates, performance is a pervasive phenomenon in the context of thefamily, with significant consequences for the law. Indeed, perhapsmore so than any other area of the law, performances are central tothe conception and functioning of family law.86 See Kimberle Crenshaw, Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, andViolence Against Women of Color, 43 STAN.

Groups also perform thecategory of \"family\" itself, where the collective identity is the relevantrole. From the subway to the office to the Thanksgiving table, theseacts are performative in the Butlerian sense of constituting social cate-gories with significant cultural meaning and relevance. The perform-ances also shape the social fronts that become the shorthand for thesecategories.Before describing these performances and the performative pro-cess in greater detail, however, it is important to clarify a key term.This Article defines a familial performance as family-related behaviorthat has a communicative effect on others or on the self. 90 Thebehavior must have some connection to family and familial status,which will often be context specific. The decision to wear a scarf inwinter is not the performance of family, unless it is a head scarf wornto convey marital status, as in some religious communities.91Conducting a business meeting is not the performance of family,unless it is a family-owned business. But so much prosaic behavior isthe performance of family, from wearing a wedding ring to picking upa child from school. Through their communicative impact, these per-formances, collectively and over time, have a tremendous performa-tive effect on familial categories. 9290 Calling this conduct a performance and not simply \"behavior\" serves as a point ofentry into the literature on performance and performativity. It also resonates with muchfelt experience, in which family members often are aware of performing for others. Seeinfra Part II.A (describing examples of this phenomenon). The scholarship on family lawand social norms does some work to explain the communicative effect of family behavior.See, e.g., Elizabeth S. Scott, Social Norms and the Legal Regulation of Marriage, 86 VA. L.REV. 1901, 1907-12 (2000). However, this literature does not contemplate the muchbroader notion of performativity. Social norms and familial performances are related con-ceptually and practically, but ultimately are distinct phenomena. Social norms play a cen-tral role in regulating family life, but the typical definition of a social norm-the rules ofbehavior that individuals follow independent of any legal obligation or formal penalty fornoncompliance-is decidedly narrower than this Article's working definition of familialperformance. For example, social norms require a degree of consensus in any given com-munity. By contrast, the salience of performance often comes from its nonconformity.Familial performances do, however, help shape social norms, and in this way many socialnorms around the family are rooted in performance.91 For example, Orthodox Jewish women cover their heads with a scarf, hat, or wig toshow they are married. Susannah Heschel, Gender and Agency in the FeministHistoriography of Jewish Identity, 84 J. RELIGION 580, 580 (2004).92 This Article is interested in the effect of familial performances on others, and thus itfocuses on the uptake of familial performances.

A playground is its own theater in the round, Twitterfeeds memorialize family interactions,93 and a simple cookie-bakingsession can become a performance for an audience of thousandsthrough a parent's blog.94 The workplace is another stage for the per-formance of family. Parents and spouses often choose to display pic-tures of family members. 95 Some workplaces demand a certain kind offamilial performance. Lehman Brothers was not alone among WallStreet investment banking firms in putting tremendous pressure on(uniformly male) top executives to be married and have their wivesact in a certain way. 96 At annual firm gatherings, wives were expectedto hike, shop, and never complain about their husbands' frequentabsences from family life.97 Divorce was strongly frowned upon.98Family members also perform within the home. When friends andrelatives come over for a family gathering, hosts often clean the house,put on nice clothes, and serve special food.99 And family membersmay perform for each other, as when a father hides his fear and pre-tends not to be scared of the big spider over the bed.

In some settings, a woman may want to downplay her family (or, in Yoshino'swords, cover her family) so as not to remind others that she is a mother and has childcareresponsibilities. See YOSHINO, supra note 79, at 150-51 (describing how some womendeliberately choose not to display photographs of their children at work). Men, however,typically do not face this problem because even if they have children, the assumption isthat they do not have significant childcare responsibilities.96 See Vicky Ward, Lehman's Desperate Housewives, VANITY FAIR, Apr. 2010, at 146(noting that CEO Dick Fuld kept a \"watchful eye on his executives' marriages\").97 See id.98 See id. at 148.99 In this way, not only adults, but also children perform, both as objects and subjects.Parents trot out children for the annual holiday card or at social gatherings to show \"thefamily.\" Children can also be props in a parent's material world.

And one need only glance at reality televi-sion shows to see familial performances in their most contrived, exag-gerated sense. Whether it is Michelle Duggar wearing her fixed smileand brushing her children's hair on 19 Kids and Counting or Ramonarenewing her wedding vows on The Real Housewives of New YorkCity, the cameras are always rolling. The families are aware of theaudience and act accordingly, sometimes with the same transgressiveglee Butler identifies in drag performances of gender, and other timesaffirming iconic familial images.Political families are often only slightly less contrived than thoseon reality television, although far more may be riding on the perform-ance than short-lived fame. Family is crucial to a candidate's success,particularly in presidential campaigns. The conventional politicalwisdom is that voters care about the candidate's spouse because thatperson speaks volumes about the candidate's character.102 The candi-date may be on the ballot, but the family is running for office, andpoliticians carefully craft the family's public persona, from John F.Kennedy's picture perfect family, with John Jr. peeking out from100 After a revealing event, family members will often say they had.no idea that X wasdrinking or taking illegal drugs surreptitiously.

Communicative Effect and PerformativityThe central defining feature of these familial performances istheir communicative effect, on others and on the self.104 When it ispredominantly mothers and female babysitters picking up childrenafter school, this sends a message about the role of women as primarycaregivers.105 When an employee displays family photographs at work,this sends a message to coworkers about sexual orientation and familystatus. And when a father pretends he is not afraid of the spider, he iscommunicating to his children the supposed invincibility of parents. Inpopular culture, what is performed and what is consumed is an ideal-ized or refracted image of family. And in politics, the images projectedby political families, however dissonant with behavior behind closeddoors,106 speak volumes about the candidate's aspirations. 0 7103 Political performances are also perilous. For example, Hillary Clinton set off a mael-strom in the 1992 election when she derisively said in response to a question about\"whether [she] could have avoided an appearance of a conflict of interest when [her] hus-band was Governor\": \"I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and hadteas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before myhusband was in public life.\" HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, LIVING HisTORY 109 (2003).104 Communication is complex and imperfect in many ways and an implicit message maybe missed or misunderstood. When an African American woman picks up her biracial childfrom school, an observer may assume that she is the nanny, not the mother, and thereforethe message that families can be interracial will be lost, at least on this particular audience.See Angela Onwuachi-Willig & Jacob Willig-Onwuachi, A House Divided: The Invisibilityof the Multiracial Family, 44 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REV. 231, 240 (2009) (describing thisphenomenon in other contexts). Similarly, some performances may be discounted. If votersknow a candidate has been unfaithful to his wife, they may dismiss a calculated perform-ance of togetherness just before an election. But much family-related behavior will conveya message, and over time iterated performances have tremendous communicative effect.105 For an excellent discussion of this dynamic, see Darren Rosenblum, UnsexMothering: Toward a New Culture of Parenting, 35 HARV. J.L. & GENDER 58-78 (2012)(describing the multiple \"ways in which legal and social norms configure parenting as asexed endeavor,\" with mothers understood as the primary parent and fathers as peripheralcaregivers).106 See, e.g., JOHN HEILEMANN & MARK HALPERIN, GAME CHANGE: OBAMA AND THECLINTONs, MCCAIN AND PALIN, AND THE RACE OF A LIFETIME 135-42, 166-69 (2010)(describing how, even after John Edwards revealed to Elizabeth his liaison with RielleHunter, they continued to appear together at campaign events to portray a strong mar-riage). The Edwardses' marriage was part of the appeal of John Edwards; therefore, theperformance was crucial. The high stakes game was impression management in theextreme.107 The absence of a family can be almost as politically salient. After the White Houseannounced the nominations of Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan for the SupremeCourt, for example, a continuing theme in the media coverage was that both women wereunmarried and childless. See Lisa Belkin, Judging Women, N.Y. TIMES, May 23, 2010,Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 611NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWThe communicative effect of these performances is not necessa-rily diminished if the performance is insincere, unconscious, or notintended to send a message. Instead, what matters is the effect of theperformance on the actor and the audience.108 To begin, a contrivedperformance may still be highly communicative, even when the audi-ence knows of the contrivance. Think of the effect of televisionsitcoms.109 And both conscious and unconscious performances canhave a communicative effect. Wearing a wedding ring and the fact ofpregnancy are both examples of performing family. Wearing the ringis a conscious choice taken by a person, at least in part, to conveyfamilial status. By contrast, a pregnant woman may prefer that no oneknows about her pregnancy, or she may be indifferent about othersknowing, but she likely cannot conceal her pregnancy in the later(Magazine), at 11, 11 (using Justices Kagan and Sotomayor to argue that women's ability topursue both family and career has increased only slightly over time); Maureen Dowd, Allthe Single Ladies, N.Y. TIMES, May 19, 2010, at A27 (describing public speculation aboutwhy Justice Kagan had not married). Justice Sotomayor staved off these concerns bypresenting herself as having a family of friends, former clerks, and extended relatives, seeSheryl Gay Stolberg, A Trailblazer and a Dreamer, N.Y. TIMEs, May 27, 2009, at Al, animage she affirmed in her memoir. See SONIA SOTOMAYOR, MY BELOVED WORLD 229(2013) (\"I have followed my mother's approach to family, refusing to limit myself to acci-dents of birth, blood, and marriage.\"). Women in public life are thus in a double bind.Having children often means losing career ground, see JOAN WILLIAMS, UNBENDINGGENDER: WHY FAMILY AND WORK CONFLICT AND WHAT TO Do ABOUT IT 64-80 (2000),but not having children can also be problematic politically.108 See supra note 30 (discussing Austin's theory of perlocutionary utterances-wordsthat have an effect on others). Sometimes the audience is the self. Consider former senatorLarry Craig, who performed heterosexual family on the Senate floor and in his personallife by covering his sexual attraction to men. See Dana Milbank, A Senator's Wide Stance:'I Am Not Gay,' WASH. PosT, Aug. 29, 2007, at A2 (describing Republican Senator LarryCraig's arrest relating to a homosexual encounter in the Minneapolis airport). If we specu-late Craig had convinced himself that he truly was uninterested in having sex with men,then he also performed heterosexual family for himself.109 Moreover, although we are more apt to think of contrivance in negative terms, itneed not take on this meaning and even manufactured performances can be normativelydesirable. Just as Goffman argued that performers can traverse the continuum of sincerity,coming to believe an initially insincere performance, see supra text accompanying notes45-52, the tactic known as \"fake it till you make it\" has an important place in family life.See WILLIAM IAN MILLER, FAKING IT 220-31 (2003) (suggesting that aspects of familialinteraction involve performance). Indeed, scripts and social fronts can be constraining, butthey are not always so. Sometimes they can help a person transition into a different stageof life. For a new parent uncertain how to care for a child, following the examples set byother parents can be an important source of information and acculturation to the world ofparenthood. Parents may \"fake it\" at first, but will ultimately \"make it\" their own sincereperformance. The writer Michael Lewis talked about faking attachment, noting that he didnot immediately feel close to his children, see MICHAEL LEWIS, HOME GAME: ANACCIDENTAL GUIDE TO FATHERHOOD 75-76 (2009), but that performing attentive father-hood created a real bond-another example of performativity. See id. at 76-79. More gen-erally, we often refer to \"role modeling\" as a positive force, and it is one way to thinkabout the positive side of performance.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

Finally, even when theperformance is not intended to send a message, it may still do so. Afamily living in an apartment building with thin walls may interactwithout thinking about the unseen audience in the apartment nextdoor. The reception of the performance by the listening family is moreimportant than the intention of the actors.Performances have this communicative power in part because theintense fascination with other people's families creates a ready audi-ence. Whether out of insecurity, the desire to show off, or the need fora dose of schadenfreude, most parents are deeply aware of theparenting choices of other parents.\" 0 Any parent can provide a storyabout the subway or supermarket checkout line, where performancecritics feigned indifference while surreptitiously scrutinizing parentingchoices. To parent is to perform. Romantic partners, too, are attentiveto other intimate relationships, examining how couples interact andnegotiate various issues.111These performances do more than send messages about thefamily. As Butler's work in the analogous context of gender demon-strates, these performances are performative-helping shape familialcategories and the notion of \"family.\" We form an idea of a family bylooking around us, at families on the bus, playground, television, andin each other's homes. When a mother breastfeeds on a park bench orat home with a friend over for coffee, she is making a choice aboutwhat she wants for herself and her child. But her act also sends a mes-sage, even if unintentionally, about mothers. When children watchfamily sitcoms, they internalize the performances when assessing theirown families and family roles. When adults watch romantic comedies,they may know \"it's just a movie,\" but the performance can stillinform conceptions of romance, intimacy, and the place of110 See, e.g., Sanctimommy Definition: Top-Ten User Submitted Words, MERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE, http://www.merriam-webster.com/top-ten-lists/top-10-user-submitted-words-vol-4/sanctimommy.html?&t=1287166944 (last visited Mar. 12, 2013) (defining\"sanctimommy\" as \"a mother who points out perceived faults in the parenting of others\");Ayelet Waldman et al., Who's the Best Mommy of Them All?, N.Y.

Take, for example, two fathers pushing their child ina stroller down the street. Depending on the context, the men andtheir child may not be perceived as a family, but instead as one fatherwalking his child accompanied by a friend. 114Goffman's insights about the relationship between performancesand social fronts are also relevant to understanding the performanceof family. Performances construct familial categories in the Butleriansense, but performances also create recognizable social fronts.\" 5 Thesocial front becomes the shorthand for the category, communicating112 To give just one truly performed example: Mainstream movies almost always portrayheterosexual sex as vaginal intercourse culminating in a mutual orgasm. Despite evidencethat most women do not regularly climax in this way, see SHERE HIE, THE HITE REPORT:A NATIONWIDE STUDY OF FEMALE SEXUALITY 184-85 (1981), many men and women feelinadequate when this result does not happen in real life. See id. at 181-84 (quoting studyparticipants' feelings of dissatisfaction with the lack of female orgasm achieved throughintercourse).113 See supra note 32 (explaining Austin's assertion that there must be accepted conven-tional procedure in order for an action to become performance).114 Cf Rosenblum, supra note 105, at 58-78 (describing the lack of recognition for gayfathers, who are not seen as \"real\" parents).115 These social fronts are both literal and metaphorical. In the literal sense, new parentsmay find that it is difficult to act the part of mother or father anomalously because thefront is already set. For example, fathers are taking on an increasing amount of responsi-bility for raising children. See SUZANNE M. BIANCHI ET AL., CHANGING RHYTHMS OFAMERICAN FAMILY LIFE 169 (2006) (stating that modern fathers are more active in thehome, \"increasingly taking on the responsibility for basic, routine aspects of caregiving\"rather than just the \"easier or more enjoyable activities of child care\"). However, somefathers report the resistance they receive at work when these responsibilities conflict withwork obligations. See Lisa Belkin, When Mom and Dad Share It All, N.Y. TIMES, June 15,2008, (Magazine), at 44, 78 (describing the pushback many fathers have felt in the work-place as a result of attempting to share parenting equally). For an example of the meta-phorical front of familial roles, consider the example of the nomination of Zoe Baird as thefirst female Attorney General. One theme in the intense media coverage of the nominationwas Baird's ability to find powerful male mentors. See Sidney Blumenthal, Adventures inBabysitting, NEW YORKER, Feb. 15, 1993, at 53, 54. In the words of a friend, Baird wassuccessful in these relationships because she \"gives good daughter.\" See id. Beyond theobvious (although not irrelevant) sexual connotation is the idea that being a daughter is afamiliar role that can be played in a variety of contexts, including professionally. It is animportant role for a talented and ambitious woman because it is less threatening to be seenin the subordinate role of daughter. Ironically, her downfall was that she had failed to play\"mother\" correctly, and had incurred the wrath of the public by coming across as a wealthywoman who left her child behind. See id. at 58-59 (discussing the outcry over the revela-tion that Baird had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny for her son, which ulti-mately scuttled her nomination as Attorney General).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review614 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYto others who is in the category and who is not. 116 A woman with ababy in a sling is a mother. A man wearing a wedding ring is a hus-band. And a group of individuals posing on the front of a holiday cardis a family. But a group of five adults sharing a house is not.117 Almostby definition, social fronts tend to be narrow, reflecting the typical(and sometimes idealized) performance.Social fronts-and the categories themselves-change over time,of course, but the way they change is through other, iterated perform-ances. 1 s When fathers begin to pick up children from school, theirperformances may initiate, even if only fitfully, the slow process ofchanging the social front of fatherhood, and, more fundamentally, thecategory of fatherhood itself. Social fronts also differ from one com-munity and culture to the next. There is not a universal social front formothers or fathers, but within a given culture or community therelikely is a dominant social front.Finally, family members may deploy or resist dominant socialfronts. When a candidate for public office brings his family to a cam-paign event, he deploys the positive associations of family and father-hood. And when a mother decides not to talk about her children overthe water cooler at work, she resists the equation of women withmotherhood. But in both instances, the performances are part of theperformative process, reaffirming and sometimes slowly altering socialfronts.116 See supra text accompanying note 53 (describing the exclusionary work of socialfronts).117 Although courts typically do not recognize groups of unrelated individuals livingtogether as a family, there are exceptions, particularly when the group acts like a family,sharing expenses and the responsibilities of cooking and cleaning. See, e.g., Borough ofGlassboro v. Vallorosi, 568 A.2d 888, 893-95 (N.J. 1990) (establishing a definition of familythat makes no explicit distinction between related and unrelated individuals).118 As Goffman argues, performances help define membership in a group, see supra textaccompanying note 53, and through this exclusionary work, performances simultaneouslyevoke and reflect anxiety about boundaries and larger cultural issues, such as propergender roles. Debates about the proper role for mothers and fathers are really a tug of warover gender. The intense competitiveness around parenting in general, and mothering inparticular, is about the value of these roles and the choices made within them, withmothers quick to chastise each other as a means of elevating their own choices.There are numerous other insights from applying Goffman's work to familial perform-ances. For example, Goffman argued that idealized performances can play an importantrole in reinforcing community values. See supra text accompanying notes 45-48. This canbe true, too, with family life. Domestic violence may occur largely behind closed doors,with negative implications for the perception of the problem, see infra notes 214, 232, butthis idealized performance of family helps reinforce the important message that violencehas no place in the family.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

IntersectionalityFamilial performances inevitably interact with other sociallysalient aspects of identity, which in turn overlap with each other.Much of what gives heft to familial roles, and also makes them morefraught, is the connection with race, gender, sexual orientation, andclass. The scene of an executive's wife hosting a party rings true (andalso grates) because of the contested role of women in our society.The image of President Barack Obama's seemingly perfect family ispowerful precisely because it contrasts so sharply with a cultural nar-rative about irresponsible Black fathers. 119 In this way, the perform-ance of family can only be understood in context. Motherhood, forexample, has a hallowed place in American culture,120 but this is nottrue for all mothers. The single, low-income, African Americanmother-the \"welfare queen\"-is an object of continued derision. 121To play out the intersection of family with gender, race, and class,return to the performance of two men pushing a stroller down thestreet. Assuming that observers understand the men and the child tobe a family, the basic family message is that a same-sex couple can bea family. More precisely, however, the performance sends the messagethat two men can be caregivers, in spite of a societal association withwomen and caregiving. Similarly, if one or both of the men are119 The performance of family by politicians exemplifies a gender differential. A malecandidate for public office can deploy his family publicly as an asset, typically to humanizehimself, whereas a female candidate's family may be perceived as a liability. See, e.g.,Jonathan Martin, Sarah Palin Is Wreaking Havoc on the Campaign Trail, GOP SourcesSay, POLITICO (Oct. 21, 2010, 4:49 AM), www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43936.htm(discussing the GOP's difficulties in booking Palin for campaign events and noting thatPalin has \"certain responsibilities that other major figures in the Republican party don'thave-in her case, five kids, one of whom is very young\").120 Wiktionary, for example, defines \"motherhood and apple pie\" as \"[p]rinciples orvalues with which few disagree.\" Motherhood and Apple Pie Definition, WIKTIONARY,http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motherhood-and-apple-pie (last visited Mar. 12, 2013).121 In the 2012 presidential election, for example, the Republican candidate MittRomney ran a political advertisement claiming that President Obama had eviscerated wel-fare reform by dropping work requirements. See Mitt Romney, Long History, YouTUBE(Aug. 13, 2012), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j79YAlrRiWM. As commentatorsquickly noted, both the claim itself and the visual imagery in the advertisement-whichshows only White people working and repeatedly shows President Obama's face-evokedthe cultural script of Whites as industrious and African Americans as lazy. See, e.g., CallumBorchers, Points Amiss in Romney's Ads on Welfare, BosTON GLOBE, Aug. 17, 2012, at A2(quoting analyses of the advertisement by numerous commentators). This script is encapsu-lated in President Reagan's use of the term \"welfare queen.\" See Franklin D. Gilliam, Jr.,The 'Welfare Queen' Experiment: How Viewers React to Images of African-AmericanMothers on Welfare, NIEMAN REPORTS, Summer 1999, at 49, 49-50 (describing the \"narra-tive script\" of the welfare queen and its continued salience).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

When aWhite man pushes a stroller with his husband, the message conveyedby the performance is largely about sexual orientation. But when anAfrican American man pushes the stroller with his husband, the per-formance takes on a different meaning because of the intersection ofrace and sexual orientation within the performer. The performancecommunicates a message to both the \"Black community,\" where thefather may face demands of heterosexuality, 125 and the \"gay commu-nity,\" where he may face racial stereotypes about his sexualprowess.126 The performance thus sends a message that counters thesestereotypes: African American men can be both gay and familyoriented.In short, the performance of family can be understood only byconsidering questions of race, class, gender, and other salient aspects122 Interracial marriage is, of course, replete with performances and changing socialfronts.123 See Russell K. Robinson, Uncovering Covering, 101 Nw. U. L. REV. 1809, 1819-23(2007) (reviewing YOSHINO, supra note 79, and emphasizing minority-imposed coveringdemands, including the demand that Black men be available for Black women, thus castingout gay Black men).124 See, e.g., Randy Albelda et al., Poverty in the Lesbian, Gay, and BisexualCommunity, WILLIAMS INST., 1 (Mar. 2009), http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Albelda-Badgett-Schneebaum-Gates-LGB-Poverty-Report-March-2009.pdf (noting this stereotype). Although not directly related to intersectionality, it isworth noting that messages also depend on context. If the men are pushing the strollerdown the sidewalk in a liberal college town, the performance will likely be unremarkable.If it is a conservative neighborhood, the performance could be highly transgressive. If it is atraditionally gay community, the performance could be simultaneously unremarkable andtransgressive-two gay men would be commonplace, but participating in parenthood couldbe understood as joining the mainstream. See, e.g., Michael Warner, Beyond Gay Marriage,in LEFr LEGALISM/LEFT CRITIQUE 259, 259-63 (Wendy Brown & Janet Halley eds., 2002)(criticizing some organizations in the same-sex marriage movement as \"fundamentallyalien\" because of their emphasis on heterosexual norms).125 See Robinson, supra note 123 (describing these demands).126 See id. at 1819-23 (\"Because White gay men establish the norms in gay communitieslike West Hollywood and Chelsea, they set the rules of engagement.

More importantly, it is true in the broader sense of performa-tivity, in which performances and the law work together to shapelegally significant familial categories and legal doctrine.This Part argues that there are three important insights that flowfrom conceiving of family law in performative terms. First, the law'sapproach to nontraditional families reinscribes traditional socialfronts-a normatively troubling response to the significant demo-graphic changes of the last decades. Second, a focus on performancetends to obscure family violence, leading to ineffective policy choices.Finally, the theoretical debate over the public-private dichotomymisses the instinctive appeal of family privacy as a space to suspendthe performance.A. Performance and the LawIn the most immediate sense, the law imbues certain words andactions with direct legal effect, as reflected in Austin's example ofsaying \"I do\" in a marriage ceremony. 127 Although the law does notrequire parties literally to say \"I do,\" the law does require certainpublic actions and then grants legal consequences to those actions.128The performance thus has a legally performative aspect to it, as actand word create a marriage. 129 Similarly, common law marriage, stillrecognized in a minority of states,130 requires a couple to follow aprescribed script.13 1 In this way, some aspects of family law are127 See supra text accompanying notes 27-33.128 In most states, couples must solemnize the marriage through some form of cere-mony, even if it is just before the city clerk. See, e.g., ARIz. REV. STAT. ANN. § 25-125(A)(2004); N.Y. Dom. REL. LAW § 11 (Consol. 2007).129 Cf Parker & Sedgwick, supra note 54, at 11 (noting that weddings typically include awitness and therefore are theater).130 See GoRAN LIND, COMMON LAW MARRIAGE: A LEGAL INSTITUTION FORCOHABITATION 8-10 (2008) (stating that Alabama, Colorado, the District of Columbia,Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah stillrecognize common law marriage).131 See, e.g., In re Estate of Garges, 378 A.2d 307, 309 (Pa. 1977) (describing the ele-ments of common law marriage, including the requirement that the couple present them-selves to others as married).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review618 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYdirectly performative-to say something is to do something, legallyspeaking.But performances and the law have a broader, more foundationalrelationship, creating, maintaining, and altering legal categories alongwith accompanying social fronts. This process remains largely belowthe surface, however, and legal actors do not acknowledge theperformative nature of much of family law.1. Category Creation, Maintenance, and AlterationOne of the primary functions of family law is defining catego-ries-who is a father, mother, child, spouse, and even what counts as afamily. Some of these categories have a biological basis. The tradi-tional conception of family, for example, is based on the pairing oftwo opposite-sex adults who produce offspring. But the law has neverlimited legal families to this narrow definition. Opposite-sex adultswho are incapable of, or not interested in, procreation are allowed tomarry.132 Adoption laws have long allowed adults to raise children towhom they are not biologically related.133 And, more recently, par-entage rules generally do not recognize sperm and egg donors as legalparents. 134In creating legal categories, then, biology is only part of the equa-tion. A closer examination of the process of familial definition revealsthat family law relies heavily on performances to determine who is inand who is out of the family.As Part II demonstrated, familial performances play a centralrole in the social construction of familial categories. But if perform-ances are the building blocks of these constructed familial catego-ries,13 5 then law is the mortar. When the law grants legal recognitionto some relationships but not others, it amplifies what would other-wise be a personal performance and gives it greater sway than it mighthave absent legal acknowledgment. This affects the creation, mainte-nance, and alteration of familial categories and the accompanyingsocial front.132 No state law limits marriage to couples intending to procreate.133 See Joan Heifetz Hollinger & Naomi Cahn, Forming Families by Law: Adoption inAmerica Today, 36 HUM. RTs. 16, 16 (2009) (\"[S]tates began enacting formal adoptionlaws in the mid-nineteenth century.\").134 See Cahn, supra note 5, at 387-91 (describing these laws, although also notingnumerous gaps and inconsistencies among states).135 See supra text accompanying note 53 (describing Goffman's argument that perform-ances define and police membership in groups).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 619NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWa. Creating CategoriesTo understand legal category creation and performance, considerthe doctrine governing the legal rights of unwed fathers. In thelandmark case Stanley v. Illinois, Peter Stanley was raising three chil-dren with his partner Joan.136 Peter and Joan never married, althoughfunctionally they operated as a family, living together and jointlyraising the children.137 According to the majority opinion, Peter wasan involved father, taking an active role in his children's lives and,crucially, providing economic support to the family.138 After Joandied, Illinois invoked a state law providing that children of unwedfathers become wards of the state upon the death of the mother, andthe state thus placed the children with court-appointed guardians. 39The Court struck down the Illinois statute, holding that althoughmany unwed fathers may well be uninvolved in the lives of their chil-dren, the state could not presume that this is true in all instances andinstead must allow unwed fathers an opportunity to prove their com-mitment.140 Eleven years later, in Lehr v. Robertson,141 the Courtaffirmed that economic support was the hallmark of this commitment,holding that where an unwed father had taken no steps to establish arelationship with his child, and, importantly, had not economicallysupported the child, the state could order an adoption without hisconsent.142In both Stanley and Lehr, the Court relied on the performance offatherhood, examining the actions of the men to determine whetherthey had acted like fathers by supporting their children.143 Indeed,much of the disagreement between the majority and dissent in both136 405 U.S. 645, 646, 650 (1972) (noting that Joan and Peter had lived together \"inter-mittently\" for eighteen years and that Peter had \"sired and raised\" the three children).137 See id. at 650 n.4 (concluding that Peter lived with the children and that he supportedthem for all of their lives).138 See id.139 See id. at 650 (describing the state's statutory scheme, including the provision thatchildren can be removed from their homes if they have no surviving parent, and furtherdefining parent to mean \"the father and mother of a legitimate child, or the survivor ofthem; or the natural mother of an illegitimate child, and includes any adoptive parent\")(quoting ILL.

In Stanley, themajority portrayed Peter Stanley as a regular dad, actively raising thechildren and helping support the family financially.14 4 By contrast, thedissent portrayed Stanley as an irresponsible mercenary, only toowilling to place his children with another family and concerned prima-rily with his continued receipt of the children's welfare benefits. 145Similarly, in Lehr, the majority began the opinion by framing thequestion as \"whether New York has sufficiently protected an unmar-ried father's inchoate relationship with a child whom he has neversupported and rarely seen in the two years since her birth.\"146As these cases illustrate, when fathers act as breadwinners, theyshape the category of \"father\" and give it a particular social front:Fathers are men who provide economically for their children. The lawthen takes this narrow, idealized social front, cements it into a legalcategory-fatherhood-and invokes the construction to judge allwould-be fathers. Economic fatherhood thus becomes the legal defini-tion of fatherhood-at least for unwed fathers. By transforming asocial front into a legal category, courts and legislatures are not cre-ating familial categories out of whole cloth; instead, they look forscripts in the world around them.b. Maintaining CategoriesJust as the law reifies social fronts into legal categories, it alsohelps maintain the accompanying social front.147 The newly emergingrules around assisted reproductive technology, for example, reinforcethe categories of mother and father as individuals who act a certainway toward a child and who need not be genetically related to thechild. A man who donates sperm or a woman who donates her egg is144 See Stanley, 405 U.S. at 646, 651 (describing how Stanley lived intermittently with themother and three children and \"raised\" the children); id. at 663 n.2 (Burger, C.J., dis-senting) (describing Stanley's assertion \"that he loved, cared for, and supported these chil-dren from the time of their birth until the death of their mother\").145 See id. at 667 (noting that after the mother's death, Stanley left the children withanother family, made no effort to regain custody of the children, and even after the statebegan dependency proceedings did not seek to assume legal responsibility for the children,but instead \"seemed, in particular, to be concerned with the loss of the welfare paymentshe would suffer as a result of the designation of others as guardians of the children\").146 Lehr, 463 U.S. at 249-50.147 Cf. Robert W. Gordon, Critical Legal Histories, 36 STAN. L. REV. 57, 103 (1984)(arguing that law is never \"peripheral to 'real' social relations,\" and instead \"legal rela-tions ... don't simply condition how the people relate to each other but to an importantextent define the constitutive terms of the relationship\"). There are interesting, althoughultimately unknowable, causation questions in the relationship between performance andthe law. For purposes of this Article, it is sufficient to acknowledge a feedback loopbetween performance and law, working together to create and reinforce social fronts.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 621NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWnot considered the legal father or mother of any child that resultsfrom the gametes.148 Adoption laws, too, confer parental rights on aperson not biologically related to the child.149In both instances, the law reaffirms that the social front ofparenthood does not depend solely on a biological connection.Instead, to be a mother or father is to act like a mother or father. Inthis way, the legal system maintains the categories it helped tocreate. 50c. Altering CategoriesThe law also helps alter categories and here, too, performance iscentral. The ongoing debate over marriage equality, for example, isfundamentally about controlling the meaning (the social front) ofmarriage. This is best illustrated by the dispute in California, wheresame-sex couples are eligible for all the tangible benefits of marriagethrough that state's domestic partnership law, but advocates on bothsides still focus on the importance of the term \"marriage.\"\"'5 Same-sex couples claim that only marriage, not a domestic partnership, willgive their relationships the recognition they deserve. 152 And oppo-nents of marriage equality, many of whom support the domestic part-nership law, contend that marriage is a unique institution intendedonly for one man and one woman.153 In short, as the Ninth Circuitreasoned in Perry v. Brown, the marriage label matters because thereis no social meaning attached to the term domestic partnership.154148 Supra note 134 and accompanying text.149 See, e.g., CAL. FAM. CODE § 7664(a)-(b) (West 2004) (setting forth the proceduresfor terminating the parental rights of a biological parent and creating parental rights in theadoptive parent).150 Another example is child support laws, which reinforce the social front of economicfatherhood. These laws require noncustodial parents to provide economic support, but nottime or attention, to their children. See, e.g., CAL. FAM. CODE § 4053 (West 2004) (settinguniform rules for the determination of child support and framing those support obligationsunder principles that prioritize financial payments); N.Y. Dom. REL. LAw § 240(1)(a)(Consol. 2008) (requiring non-custodial parents to pay a share of child support expensesbut not mandating that non-custodial parents visit their children). These parents are over-whelmingly fathers. See TIMOTHY S. GRALL, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, CUSTODIAL MOTHERSAND FATHERS AND THEIR CHILD SUPPORT: 2005, CURRENT POPULATION REPORTS 3(2007), available at http://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/p60-234.pdf (\"In 2006, 5 of every6 custodial parents were mothers (83.8 percent) and 1 in 6 were fathers (16.2 percent).\").151 Perry v.

Law Review622 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYThus, when courts and legislatures decide whether, as a matter ofpolicy or constitutional necessity, same-sex couples should be allowedto marry, these legal institutions weigh in on the dispute over thesocial front of marriage. Iterated performances of commitment by les-bian and gay couples began the process of altering the social front oflong-term relationships. 155 When courts and legislators open marriageto same-sex couples, this hastens the collective process. In this way,family law ratifies one performance in the face of contestation andultimately helps change the public meaning of marriage.Loss of control of the social front of marriage is precisely whatconcerns conservatives. If the social front of marriage is no longer oneman and one woman, it will be that much harder for conservatives topass along their preferred values to their children because the valuesare not reflected in the larger community. For example, a socially con-servative family may believe that men and women have distinct rolesto play in family life and that reserving marriage for opposite-sexcouples reflects and reinforces these traditional gender roles. But itwill be more difficult for the family to inculcate this value in theirchildren if the social front of marriage does not reflect this traditionaldivision.156Advocates of marriage equality sometimes dismiss opponents oflegal recognition by arguing that the opponents stand to losenothing. 57 If anything, the argument goes, opening up marriage willstrengthen opposite-sex marriage by confirming that marriage is the155 This process began with public performances of affection by gays and lesbians.Simply holding hands in public was a claim for inclusion in the category of romantic rela-tionships. Much later, as the gay rights movement gained momentum, conducting (non-legal) wedding ceremonies in front of numerous guests and announcing the marriages inthe newspaper were ways to lay claim more specifically to the category of marriage.

From the perspective of social conservatives, theDefense of Marriage Act is aptly named.1602. Uncritical Fealty to Naturalized CategoriesDespite the active role of the law in shaping familial categories,courts often are blind to performativity and instead assume the nat-ural quality of familial categories and roles. Another unwed fathercase illustrates this tendency. In Michael H. v. Gerald D.,161 theSupreme Court reviewed a state law that presumed a child bornwithin a marriage is the child of both the wife and the husband.162 Inthe case, it was a virtual certainty that the child was not the biologicaldaughter of the husband but rather was the child of the neighbor, withwhom the mother had an affair. 163 The husband, however, was on thebirth certificate and had consistently held out the child as hisdaughter. 164Much of the plurality decision turned on the mismatch betweenthe various family units in the case and the traditional social front offamily. The plurality noted that during \"the first three years of her life,[the child] remained always with [the mother], but found herselfwithin a variety of quasi-family units.\" 165 These \"quasi-family units\"included time spent living with the neighbor, who held the girl out ashis child, the husband, who did the same, and also a third man. 16 6In rejecting the parental claims of the biological father, the plu-rality embraced a naturalized understanding of the relevant legalhas no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gays and lesbians\").However, this argument ignores the importance of controlling the social front of marriage.158 Opening Brief for the Plaintiff-Petitioner, supra note 157.159 The bumper sticker for sale at http://www.cafepress.com/designedforyou.21312867 isan obvious play on the conservative organization, Focus on the Family.

Theopinion reasoned that \"California law, like nature itself, makes noprovision for dual fatherhood.\" 167 The plurality thus dismissed thesubstantive due process challenge, noting that the Constitution pro-tects only the \"unitary family,\" and that there is no history and tradi-tion of protecting a family unit that consists of \"the relationshipestablished between a married woman, her lover, and their child,during a three-month sojourn in St. Thomas, or during a subsequenteight-month period when, if he happened to be in Los Angeles, hestayed with her and the child.\" 168 Biology was not the deciding factorin the case, and it is not in this sense that courts adopt naturalizedcategories. Instead, acting like a father in a traditional sense-that is,caring for a child within a married family unit-was dispositive. Thecourt naturalized the idea of family as married parents raisingchildren.Michael H.'s reflexive fealty to seemingly natural categories isemblematic of an unwillingness to interrogate the categories at theheart of family law. Rather than acknowledge that this was a nontradi-tional family that might deserve the same protection as a traditionalfamily, the opinion simply assumed the force of the categories of\"unitary family\" and \"father.\" By judging the neighbor's performanceas too far afield from the social front of these categories, the pluralitywas unwilling to grapple with how the categories are not inviolablebut instead are social constructions, capable of change. Further, theopinion contended that it was simply parroting nature without recog-nizing that at that moment it was constructing one family as naturaland another as unnatural.By enforcing the legal fiction that sex does not occur outside ofmarriage, the decision reinforced the dominant social front of mar-riage as a monogamous institution and prevented a nonconformingperformance from upstaging the main actors-the married couple.The plurality did so in the face of a credible claim of falsity, a claim to\"stop the show.\" The plurality opinion in essence decided, like anaudience aghast at Brecht, that breaking the fourth wall separating theactors from the audience would be too destabilizing. Instead, the deci-sion explicitly reinforced the fiction that wives have intercourse onlywith their husbands and that family units are impregnable, as it were.The decision thus validated the dominant social front of marriage, butdid so in a way that reinforced the false naturalness of the category.167 Id. at 118.168 Id. at 123 n.3.

Id.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 625NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWThis reliance on a naturalized definition of family is not an iso-lated example. In Nguyen v. INS, for instance, the Supreme Courtupheld a gender-based classification that made it harder for an unwedcitizen father to pass on his citizenship to a child than for an unwedcitizen mother. 169 The Court recognized that the government has aninterest in ensuring an opportunity for the development of a closeparent-child relationship before granting citizenship benefits. TheCourt reasoned that this opportunity is \"inherent in the event of birthas to the mother-child relationship\" but cannot be presumed to existbetween the biological father and child.170 As a result, it was constitu-tional for Congress to require an unwed father, but not an unwedmother, to take visible steps (including supporting the child finan-cially) to establish a relationship with a child as a condition of passingon citizenship.At heart, this is a determination that Congress is allowed to relyupon a seemingly natural category-motherhood-and draw legisla-tive distinctions based on this category. The Nguyen Court did not askabout the construction of motherhood and fatherhood, or how thisconstruction might lead to one set of assumptions over another.Instead, the Court simply presumed the category and the conse-quences: The process of childbirth bonds mothers to their children.Men have no such biological process and therefore no presumedconnection. 171As a final example, In re Adoption of Garrett is a state court casein which a brother wanted to become the legal father of his sister'schild, which would have made the brother and sister co-parents. 172The court refused to approve the adoption petition, reasoning thatalthough courts had extended the right to adopt to both unmarriedand same-sex couples, these relationships were \"the functionalequivalent of the traditional husband-wife relationship.\"1 7 3 Thebrother and sister were not intimate and therefore could not be co-parents.

Performancesmay be broadly constructive, but the law is particularly constitutive inprivileging one set of performances as natural.B. Normative NarrowingThe central concern with performative family law is that the lawtends to draw on, and reinforce, idealized performances and dominantsocial fronts. 174 This process assumes the essential value of the tradi-tional performance and reaffirms and reinscribes iconic images offamily. In this way, performative family law is not a neutral phenom-enon. Instead, the constitutive relationship between performance andlaw undermines pluralism, which is particularly problematic in light ofrecent demographic changes in the American family.1. Obscuring Nontraditional FamiliesThe normative narrowing of performative family law is omni-present, but it particularly affects those outside the marital family. Indetermining whether a nonmarital family should be treated as a legalfamily, for example, courts often engage in what amounts to an assess-ment of whether the family is a \"real\" family-that is, whether it suffi-ciently reflects the dominant social front. In the context of marriageequality, when courts and legislatures entertain the expansion of mar-riage to same-sex couples, they ask, in effect, whether same-sexcouples are enough like opposite-sex couples that they deserve theright to marry.Advocates of marriage equality understand this relationshipbetween law and performance and so consciously deploy images ofsame-sex couples that are very close to the prevailing social front.Lesbians and gay men are portrayed as long-term committed partnersand parents who seek nothing more than normalcy.17 5 These arefamiliar types, easily recognizable to the audience. In test-case litiga-tion, lawyers carefully select plaintiffs who have been together for a174 As discussed below, a performative family law need not draw upon narrow, domi-nant social fronts. For performances to have uptake, they must have some element of con-vention, see supra notes 32-33 and accompanying text, but the law could draw on an arrayof performances. Part IV.A develops this possibility in greater detail.175 See supra note 19 (describing examples of this strategy, used by advocates of mar-riage equality and the Iowa Supreme Court, to explain why same-sex couples would beallowed to marry).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

She argues that the legalrecognition of same-sex marriage risks bringing same-sex relationshipswithin the constraints of heterosexual relationships and furthermarginalizing a conception of intimacy and desire not based on mar-riage.178 She contends that both the decision in Lawrence v. Texas,' 79and the gay rights movement's response to it, reflect a narrow concep-tion of liberty as residing within the domestic sphere; neither the deci-sion nor the gay rights movement envisions a broad view of sexualliberty that would embrace non-normative visions of sex, sexuality,and relationships.1 8 0 In this way, marriage equality can be understoodas a conservative movement at its core, with same-sex couples askingfor the attendant obligations and one-size-fits-all approach ofmarriage.The same normative narrowing concern attends familial roles.One of the main goals and purposes of family law is to regulate thebehavior of family members. By delineating clear categories and thenspecifying how a person should act in each role-parents do X,spouses do Y-family law writes the script for much of family life. Thelaws of marriage and divorce specify how spouses and ex-spousesshould act toward each other, and laws setting forth parental responsi-bilities establish what parents should do for their children.

In exchange, the stategenerally does not critique the details of family members' perform-ances, at least until some crisis emerges or the intact family breaks up.By contrast, to gain legal recognition, nontraditional familiesmust closely follow a prescribed script of how families are supposed toact. In cases where functional mothers seek legal recognition, forexample, courts sometimes examine such minutiae as whether awould-be mother helped select a pediatrician and day care center,182volunteered in a child's classroom, 183 or drove a child to sports prac-tice and games.18 4 Legal rights are granted only after a searchingreview of the individual's performance to ensure consistency with theprevailing social front. Moreover, this dominant social front is oftenan idealized image of family. A legal family may eschew Mother's Dayas an overly commercialized Hallmark holiday or may simply forget tocelebrate it. But the failure to honor a functional mother on Mother'sDay can become a point of evidence in a trial about whether to conferparental rights. 8 52. Scrutinizing Marginal FamiliesThe normative narrowing of performative family law hasprofound effects on the regulation of marginal families-particularlylow-income, non-White families. The dominant social front of familyhistorically in the United States has been nuclear, economically stable,patriarchal, heterosexual, and White. 186 Families that do not fit this181 See Mary Anne Case, What Feminists Have to Lose in Same-Sex Marriage Litigation,57 UCLA L. REV. 1199, 1203-06 (2010) (describing her prior work developing the argu-ment that marriage is far less constricting than domestic partnerships because the formerrequires only the entry ritual, leaving married couples free to organize their sexual, social,and financial lives as they choose; by contrast, the recognition of a domestic partnershipturns on conformity with norms such as cohabitation, monogamy, and economic sharing).182 E.g., V.C. v.

Law Review629May 2013]NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWsocial front are in a more precarious position, susceptible to greaterscrutiny by the state. In the late nineteenth century, for example,White, upper class men and women established and ran child protec-tion societies to \"save\" abused and neglected children from theirlargely poor, immigrant parents.187 But instead of looking objectivelyat a child's health and safety, these \"child savers\" judged home lifeusing White, upper-class norms. 88 Child savers, horrified by immi-grants' use of garlic in cooking and their habit of drinking wine withdinner, were repulsed by their clients' home lives.189 The child welfaresystem is the modern day version of this imposition of White, middle-class norms, with low-income children of color removed from theirhomes at far greater rates than similarly situated White children.190Another aspect of this dynamic is that marginalized families haveless influence on the construction of legal categories. Some perform-ances simply count more than others. The performance of a single,African American mother receiving state aid, for example, has littleuptake in the construction of the dominant social front of mother-hood. Instead, it becomes the social front for deviant mothers.' 9' Thisis primarily a result of power, class, and race, but those dynamicsamplify or mute performances that might otherwise be receivedunmediated.C. ImplicationsConceiving of family law in performative terms leads to threecentral insights. First, it casts serious doubt on the law's recentattempts to address the deep demographic changes of the past fewinterventions in the nineteenth century centered on changing the behavior of families thatdid not meet these norms).187 See LINDA GORDON, HEROES OF THEIR OWN LIVES: THE PoLITICS AND HISTORY OFFAMILY VIOLENCE 8, 14-15 (1988) (describing major child protection agencies in Boston inthe late nineteenth century and the common characteristics of their workers and clients).188 For example, one of the primary bases for removing children was the determinationthat the father was not able to provide financially for the entire family and that the motherand children were in the labor force. See Hasday, supra note 186, at 332 (explaining thatchild protection workers saw poverty, and the attendant requirement for children to work,as representing moral vices of parents).189 See GORDON, supra note 187, at 46-47 (explaining the importance of the \"culturallenses\" through which child protectors viewed their clients).190 See MARTIN GUGGENHEIM, WHAT'S WRONG WITH CHILDREN'S RIGHTS 192-93(2005) (arguing that the modern child welfare system still reflects a class-based orienta-tion); DOROTHY ROBERTS, SHATTERED BONDS: THE COLOR OF CHILD WELFARE 47-55(2002) (describing evidence of race and class bias in the child welfare system).191 See DOROTHY ROBERTS, KILLING THE BLACK BODY: RACE, REPRODUCTION, ANDTHE MEANING OF LIBERTY 203-07 (1997) (describing the historical exclusion of AfricanAmericans from the welfare system and the more modern construction of low-income,African American women who receive welfare as social deviants).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

Finally, it shows that scholarly debates over the public-privatedivide are incomplete and have failed to explain why the concept offamily privacy retains such enormous appeal. This Subpart addresseseach insight in turn.1. Inscribing Dominant PerformancesOne of the most important recent family law reforms is the ALI'sPrinciples of the Law of Family Dissolution.192 Finalized in 2001, thePrinciples are an attempt by the ALI not simply to restate the lawpertaining to family dissolution as it exists across jurisdictions, but alsoto provide normative guidance to courts and legislatures. 193 Notably,the ALI wanted to respond to the increase of family-like behavioroutside of the traditional legal family. 194 Through an exhaustive pro-cess lasting more than a decade, the ALI reporters canvassed existinglaw and debated how the law could better address social needs. 195 TheALI Principles are intended as a resource for both courts and legisla-tors to consult when deciding on family law policies. 196Viewed through the lens of performativity, however, the ALI'swell-intentioned effort to treat alternative families more liberally bybringing them within the fold of family law looks more problematic.The primary concern is that the Principles recreate the normative nar-rowing of performative family law. To assimilate nontraditional fami-lies into family law, the Principles require those seeking legal rights toact in ways that reflect dominant social fronts as a condition ofreceiving legal benefits. This reinforces the primacy and normativityof the traditional family.A core provision of the Principles, for example, provides for theassimilation of cohabiting couples into domestic partnerships.197 If acouple shares \"a primary residence and a life together\" 198 for a signifi-cant period of time, then they are considered domestic partners.199192 See PRINCIPLEs, supra note 20.193 See Ira Mark Ellman, Chief Reporter's Foreword to PRINCIPLES, supra note 20, at xv.194 See Lance Liebman, Director's Foreword to PRINCIPLES, supra note 20, at xii-xiv.195 See id. at xiii (describing the process of developing the Principles).196 See Robin Fretwell Wilson, Introduction to RECONCEIVING THE FAMILY: CRITIQUEON THE AMERICAN LAW INSTITUTE'S PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW OF FAMILY DISSoLUTION 3(Robin Fretwell Wilson ed., 2006) (explaining that the Principles were written for legisla-tors to use when reforming statutes, and that, given the prestige of the American LawInstitute, courts will likely consult the Principles regularly as well).197 See PRINCIPLES, supra note 20, § 6.01(1).198 Id. § 6.03(1).199 Whether a couple is sharing a life together is determined by reference to a range offactors, including the extent to which the partners commingle finances, are economicallyImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 631NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWSimilarly, the Principles confer parental rights on a functional, or \"defacto,\" parent when the person lives with the child for at least twoyears and provides at least an equal share of the caretaking responsi-bilities for the child, for a primary purpose other thanremuneration.200Both provisions are a laudable attempt to recognize that familiesexist outside of marriage, but the provisions impose the dominantsocial front of marriage and parenthood on the would-be family mem-bers. Take, for instance, unmarried partners who are deeply com-mitted to each other but who must live apart due to careerdemands.201 Under the Principles, the failure to share a primary resi-dence means that this couple would not qualify as domestic partners.Their performance of family thus falls short because they do not sat-isfy the dominant social front of married couples. Similarly, a would-be parent under the Principles must be responsible for half of thechildcare responsibilities. Imagine a woman with a demanding jobwho is the lesbian partner of a child's biological mother. She cannotprovide half of the childcare and so, under the Principles, is not a legalmother. Finally, the Principles do not conceive of multiple adultscaring for a child, each with legal rights. The Principles thus reinscribefamily law's \"rule of two,\" which limits children to two legalparents.202interdependent, \"assume[] specialized or collaborative roles in furtherance of their lifetogether,\" change each other's lives, share emotional and physical intimacy, and have areputation as a couple. Id. § 6.03(7)(a)-(m). If a couple is in a domestic partnership andlater terminates their relationship, the Principles counsel courts to impose the same princi-ples of economic sharing that follow the dissolution of a marriage. See id. §§ 6.04-.06.Couples can, however, opt out of this imposed economic sharing if they have an enforce-able agreement to the contrary. See id. § 6.03 cmt. b.200 See id. § 2.03(1)(c).201 See, e.g., Jennifer Conlin, Living Apart for the Paycheck, N.Y. TIMES, Jan. 4, 2009, atST1 (describing a 2006 report from the U.S. Census Bureau that 3.6 million marriedAmericans are living apart from their spouses and providing anecdotal examples of thisphenomenon showing that it is largely driven by economic necessity). The most recentreport from the U.S. Census Bureau, based on the 2010 census, shows that 3.35 millionmarried Americans are living apart from their spouses. See The 2012 Statistical Abstract:Population, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (2012), http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population.html (follow \"57 - Marital Status of the Population by Sex and Age: 2010\"Excel hyperlink) (last visited Mar. 12, 2013) (listing 1,756,000 men and 1,594,000 women inthe \"married, spouse absent\" category).202 No state allows a child to have three legal parents. See, e.g., Johnson v. Calvert, 851P.2d 776, 778, 781 (Cal. 1993) (considering a situation in which three people claimed to bea child's parents and rejecting the argument that a child could have a father and twomothers). This doctrine ignores the social reality that some families function in thismanner. See infra note 245 and accompanying text (providing the example of lesbiancouples who choose to raise their children with the men who donated sperm to them).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review632 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYRequiring functional families to act like traditional familiesplaces performance at the center of the analysis, entrenching tradi-tional social fronts and undermining pluralism. This is particularlytroubling because nontraditional families often do not act like tradi-tional families. Many nontraditional families live in family circum-stances that are not consistent with the dominant social front and thusare at considerable risk that their performances will fall short.2. Offstage ViolenceLegal valorization of familial performances and the emphasis onwhat others see contributes to a cognitive dissonance about what islargely unseen. From everyday disagreements to the violence andsexual assault that mark too many families, what goes on behindclosed doors is not what is seen at the playground and the grocerystore. When the audience does stumble into the back, the scene can bestartling.203The Van Derbur family provides a compelling example. In the1950s, the Van Derbur family of Colorado was well respected andinvolved in the Denver community. 204 The Van Derburs, who had four203 For example, anthropologists and archaeologists at U.C. Irvine and UCLA recentlyconducted a study of thirty-two middle class, dual-income families with children in the LosAngeles area. See Belinda Campos et al., Opportunity for Interaction? A NaturalisticObservation Study of Dual-Earner Families After Work and School, 23 J. FAM. PsycHoL.798, 800 (2009). For two weekdays and one weekend, the researchers videotaped the fami-lies during waking hours when they were at home, and then coded their behavior. See id.Although the study generated numerous interesting findings, one revelation for theresearchers was their own reaction to what they saw. The researchers without childrenreported their shock at the level of discord in family life. Benedict Carey, Families' EveryHug and Fuss, Taped, Analyzed and Archived, N.Y.

The researchers experienced thereality that family life is often unappealing in ways that are surprising to those who typi-cally see only the front, not the back, of other families' lives.This discrepancy between the inside and outside of family life can also be surprisingfor new parents, who sometimes assume parenthood will be more exhilarating andrewarding than it often is, especially in the first few weeks. For an anecdotal account ofthis, see LEWIS, supra note 109, at 13-14 (explaining that his journal about fatherhoodbegan because of \"this persistent and disturbing gap between what I was meant to feel andwhat I actually felt\"). See also id. at 75 (\"Clutching [my first child] after she exited thewomb, I was able to generate tenderness and a bit of theoretical affection, but after that,for a good six weeks, the best I could manage was detached amusement.

AsMarilyn related in her 2004 autobiography, her father repeatedlyraped her from age five to eighteen.208 Marilyn wrote about her exper-iences as the \"night child\" who would wait, terrified, for her father topad down the hallway into her bedroom.209 She repressed the memo-ries for years210 and never told anyone until she was in her early twen-ties and a youth minister from her childhood church guessed hersecret.211 A theme throughout her childhood was the performanceinvolved in covering the incest.212 As she put it, \"I began to see ourfamily as a Hollywood set. We looked like a beautiful picture but ifyou walked through the front door of our set there was just rubble andtrash. \"213As this story illustrates, there is often a wide discrepancy betweenpositive images of family and the lived experience. Although difficultto prove as an empirical matter, it is intuitive that the disconnectbetween the social front of family life and the private back contributesto a collective cognitive dissonance surrounding family dysfunction.Few may be surprised when a politician who sings daily paeans to hiswife of many years turns out to have a child with another woman, yetit can be difficult to grasp the depth and breadth of familial205 See id. at 11 (describing the Van Derburs' impressive home and their householdemployees, which included a nanny, a gardener, a woman who did the laundry, and twowomen who cooked and cleaned).206 See id. at 12-14.207 See 1958: Marilyn Van Derbur, Miss AMERICA, http://www.missamerica.org/our-miss-americas/1950/1958.aspx (last visited Mar. 12, 2013) (describing Marilyn Van Derbur'scrowning as Miss America and her work since then).208 See VAN DERBUR, supra note 204, at 21-28 (describing this abuse and noting that ithappened regularly for thirteen years).

Despite increased awareness of domestic violence, the extent ofthe problem can still be startling. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention found that nearly one in three women has been the victim of domestic violence.See MICHELE C. BLACK ET AL., CTRS. FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION, THENATIONAL INTIMATE PARTNER AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE SURVEY: 2010 SUMMARYREPORT 2, 39 (2011), available at http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVSReport2010-a.pdf.215 There are numerous other ways in which the back does not match the front. Forexample, the exaggerated performance of traditional family values often masks a moredivergent reality. It has become almost commonplace to find prominent male social con-servatives in sexual relationships with other men. See, e.g., Milbank, supra note 108(describing Republican Senator Larry Craig's arrest relating to a homosexual encounter inthe Minneapolis airport); Frank Rich, A Heaven-Sent Rent Boy, N.Y. TIMES, May 16, 2012,at WK10 (describing Baptist minister George Reker's ten-day trip to Europe with atwenty-year-old male escort). These men seem invariably to be married with children andthey uniformly support traditional family values, condemning homosexuality and other\"deviant\" behavior, such as single parenthood. See, e.g., GEORGE ALAN REKERS,GROWING UP STRAIGHT 40 (1982) (\"Homosexual activists seek to lure our children into adeceptive and destructive fantasy world that ignores the obvious physical, social and moralboundaries of sexual expression.\").216 See DAVID FINKELHOR ET AL., U.S. DEP'T OF JUSTICE, SEXUALLY ASSAULTEDCHILDREN: NATIONAL ESTIMATES AND CHARACTERISTICS 9 (2008) (concluding, afteraddressing various methodological concerns, that \"[i]t may be inherently impossible to geta complete and unbiased accounting of all child sexual assaults close to the time theyoccur\").217 See Ryan C.W.

ThisArticle relies on studies seeking to determine the prevalence, rather than the incidence, ofchild sexual abuse. Incidence studies use official statistics, such as cases substantiated bythe child welfare system or reported to the police. Prevalence studies ask a representativesample of the population retrospective questions about specific experiences. Incidencerates are notoriously low. See, e.g., ANDREA SEDLAK ET AL., U.S. DEP'T OF HEALTH &HUMAN SERvs., FOURTH NATIONAL INCIDENCE STUDY OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT(NIS-4) 3-1 to 3-4 (2010), available at http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/statistics/nis.cfm (finding that 135,300 children were sexually abused by a parent or caretaker in the2005-06 study year). One of the hallmarks of child sexual abuse is that the child does nottell anyone, and even if the child does tell someone, the abuse is not reported to the police.See Diana E.H. Russell, The Incidence and Prevalence of Intrafamilial and ExtrafamilialSexual Abuse of Female Children, 7 CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT 133, 142 (1983) (findingthat only two percent of the intrafamilial cases and six percent of the extrafamilial cases inher study were reported to the authorities). One study that strikes a balance between inci-dence reports and retrospective prevalence studies is a 1999 survey of adult caretakers andImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 635NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWfamily,218 and for approximately thirty percent of the girls who areabused, the perpetrator is a family member.219 Despite these highprevalence rates, only a small minority of victims reports the abuse tothe authorities; this is particularly true when the offender is a familymember.220These statistics stand in marked contrast to the dominant legalresponse to child sexual abuse, which is to focus on the threat fromstrangers. Sex offender registries, for example, are intended to alertcommunities to the presence of sexual predators,221 but in doing so,they reinforce the message that the danger is from the unknown,rather than the known. Similarly, popular AMBER Alerts aredesigned primarily to address abductions by strangers,222 again rein-forcing the idea that strangers pose the greatest danger to children.The problem is rarely characterized as a threat within the home orclose to the home.223Parents thus continue to misperceive the real threats to their chil-dren. The five greatest threats to a child's safety are car accidents,youth aged ten to eighteen, which attempted to capture sexual abuse closer to the time itoccurred. See FINKELHOR ET AL., supra note 216, at 1-4. This study found that an esti-mated 285,400 children had been sexually assaulted in 1999 (defined to include rape,attempted rape, and other unwanted sexual contact involving force or coercion). See id. at2, 5.218 See REBECCA M. BOLEN, CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE: ITS SCOPE AND OUR FAILURE91-101 (2001) (discussing studies finding that abuse by strangers accounted for only sevenpercent of all sexual abuse and describing other types of extrafamilial offenders, includingfamily friends, acquaintances, and people in positions of authority who are known to thefamily).219 See id. at 113-14. Among family members, the offender is most often an uncle, see id.at 114, although in African American families, the most common offender may be a step-parent. See id. The second most common offender for all demographic groups is a father orcousin. See id. In the case of male victims, the offender is less likely to be a family member,with only eleven to twelve percent of all abuse of males occurring within the family. See idat 114. To be clear, then, in the majority of cases for both girls and boys, the perpetrator isa nonfamily member, although not a stranger to the child. This Article focuses onintrafamilial child sexual abuse because of the connection to family performances.220 See supra note 217 (discussing reporting rates).221 See Kate Blacker & Lissa Griffin, Megan's Law and Sarah's Law: A ComparativeStudy of Sex Offender Community Notification Schemes in the United States and the UnitedKingdom, 46 CRIM.

Theactive management of the familial social front by public figures andeveryday citizens alike makes it harder to believe that a father wouldrape his daughter or that an uncle would force his nephew to watchhim masturbate. 2273. The Public-Private DivideA central principle in family law is that the state should largelyleave families alone to order their own affairs. Scholars have longchallenged this concept of family privacy, and a critical step has beenthe argument made by feminists and others that the family is not aprivate institution.228 As scholars have contended, the state's determi-nation of which groupings of individuals will win the moniker\"family,\" 229 as well as who will receive the state's largesse and withwhat strings attached, 230 belies an institution that functions apart fromthe law. Further, the influence of laws regulating the workplace,224 See Lisa Belkin, To Keep a Child Safe, Just.. . , N.Y.

In one sense, family pri-vacy reflects the idea that the home is the back of the performance-aliteral and conceptual space where families interact away from anoutside audience. Indeed, families do save some behavior for the sup-posedly private sphere of the back. Think of an irate mother hissing ata child misbehaving in a grocery store, \"just wait until we gethome.\" 232But in reality, the front permeates the back. For some families,the private home is not a back because the family must still performfor outsiders, such as a child welfare caseworker conducting a homevisit. More fundamentally, the front and back collapse for all familiesbecause individuals bring societal expectations of family and familialroles into the back. For example, much of motherhood may be per-formed behind closed doors, but a woman does not perform mother-hood on a blank slate. Instead, she plays out collective meanings ofthis role, consciously and unconsciously juggling images of mother-hood largely brought home to her through the iterated performancesshe sees in numerous settings, from the playground and grocery storeto television, movies, and magazines. All of these images accompany awoman as she walks into the door of her home, ready to mother herchildren. These \"public\" images of motherhood come into the \"pri-vate\" space of the home.2 3 3 This front-into-the-back dynamic is a cru-cial way in which the public-private distinction folds into itself.234 It is231 See, e.g., Katharine B. Silbaugh, Women's Place: Urban Planning, Housing Design,and Work-Family Balance, 76 FORDHAM L. REV. 1797, 1798, 1825-39 (2007) (examining\"the role of urban planning and housing design in frustrating the effective balance of workand family responsibilities\").232 The absence of an outside audience may encourage some family members to engagein behavior they would not otherwise do in front of others. For example, in physicallyabusive relationships, the perpetrator may verbally abuse the victim in public, but almostalways saves actual blows for the home. See Domestic Violence Awareness Handbook, U.S.DEP'T OF AGRIC., http://www.dm.usda.gov/shmd/aware.htm (last visited Mar. 12, 2013)(\"The abusive man-and men are the abusers in the overwhelming majority of domesticviolence incidents-typically controls his actions, even when drunk or high, by choosing atime and place for the assaults to take place in private and go undetected.\").233 An internalized audience also exists when behind closed doors.234 Conversely, the back also comes into the front, with depictions of the \"private\"home projected into the \"public\" space. Reality television shows give viewers the illusionof peering behind the curtain, even though viewers and performers alike know the scenesare staged. And classic family dramas are ways in which depictions of private family life areImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review[Vol. 88:589638STAGING THE FAMILYnearly impossible to imagine a private family, somehow shielded fromthese outside influences.Recognizing this dynamic helps explain the visceral appeal ofclaims to family privacy. The home is not private in the sense of a law-free zone, or even a performance-free zone, but family members doconceive of it as a (relatively) audience-free zone. For families withsufficient means to have a private space, the home is a place to relaxand take off the make-up. A mother is likely unconscious of theimages of motherhood that she brings into the home and thereforethinks of the back as a much-needed space where she can let go. Thedesire for such a space helps explain why the concept of family privacyretains such broad appeal and why it is so politically difficult todevelop effective means of intervention. It is deeply unsettling torealize that the cameras really are always rolling.IVDENATURALIZING FAMILY LAWAs an antidote to the normative narrowing and policy-distortingeffects of performative family law, this Part proposes a framework fordenaturalizing family law. As Judith Butler warns, it is not possible tostep outside the performance entirely;235 therefore, the goal is not theimpossible task of creating a denaturalized family law or avoidingperformativity altogether. Instead, the objective is to move away fromnaturalized, overly constraining standards that reinscribe dominantsocial fronts. 2 36 Given their deeply constitutive nature, familial per-formances will continue to inform familial categories and the law willplay an active role in this process, ratifying some social fronts at theexpense of others. The goal is to be conscious of this dynamic andresist its more troubling aspects.shared with those outside the home. See, e.g., WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, KING LEAR; LEOToLSTOY, ANNA KARENINA (1877).235 See supra note 64 and accompanying text.236 In other words, the real problem with family law's reliance on performance is theemphasis on idealized performances, not on performance per se. Cf Linda H. Krieger, TheContent of Our Categories: A Cognitive Bias Approach to Discrimination and EqualEmployment Opportunity, 47 STAN. L. REV. 1161, 1166 (1995) (arguing that society has\"core stories [that] structur[e] the interpretation of experience and provid[e] the authorsand audiences of future stories with commonly recognized plots, symbols, themes, andcharacters,\" and that the lawyer's task in a Title VII case \"is to choose a core story fromexisting jurisprudence and then to construct, from the available facts, a new story thatresembles the core story as closely as possible\").Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013]1 639NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWA. Decentering Dominant PerformancesThe critical feature of a denaturalizing framework is the effort todecenter dominant performances, which can be accomplished in anumber of ways. This Subpart describes three such tactics.1. Broader Social FrontsA starting point for decentering dominant performances is recog-nizing broader social fronts, so that no one performance takes prece-dence over all others. One Supreme Court case addressing the familyholds some lessons in this regard. In contrast to Michael H., where theplurality opinion failed to see its own intervention in perpetuating atraditional social front,237 a more nuanced judicial approach to rolepluralism in familial performance could be modeled on the decision inMoore v. City of East Cleveland.238 In that case, the Court struckdown a local housing ordinance that had inscribed the traditionalsocial front of family by limiting occupancy to single families. 239 Thefamily at issue consisted of a grandmother, one of her children, andtwo of her grandchildren, who were cousins, not siblings-a configura-tion not allowed by the ordinance. 240The plurality opinion began by noting that constitutional protec-tion for families should not be limited to a narrow conception of thefamily. Instead, it was important to examine a broader tradition offamily patterns, including extended families.241 Justice Brennan, in aconcurrence, highlighted a role for the courts in promoting pluralism.He emphasized that the Constitution does not allow the governmentto impose \"white suburbia's preference in patterns of family living\" onthe rest of society, especially in light of the long history of low-incomefamilies coming together to pool their resources. 242Unlike the judicial enforcement of the dominant social front ofmarriage in Michael H., courts should take a cue from Moore andrecognize multiple social fronts. The opinions in Moore do not speakin performativity terms, but they evince awareness of the value of nothewing too closely to one social front of family. The opinions denatu-ralize the category of family by decentering any one performance and237 See supra notes 161-68 and accompanying text.238 431 U.S. 494 (1977).239 See id. at 505-06.240 See id. at 495-96.241 See id. at 504 (\"Ours is by no means a tradition limited to respect for the bondsuniting the members of the nuclear family. The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins, andespecially grandparents sharing a household along with parents and children has rootsequally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition.\").242 Id. at 508 (Brennan, J., concurring).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review640 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYinstead relying on a plurality of performances that reflected multiplelived experiences. In this way, Moore is a model not for abandoningperformance altogether, but rather for allowing multiple perform-ances to define familial categories.In light of family law's typical resistance to recognizing intersec-tional performances, 243 Moore is all the more remarkable for recog-nizing different family forms and acknowledging the historicalcontingency of these forms. The case demonstrates that it is possiblefor the legal system to expand, rather than constrict, the relevantsocial fronts of familial categories, decentering any one performanceand furthering the goal of pluralism.2. Alternative Means to Define the FamilyIn addition to broadening the type of performances that count,another way to decenter dominant performances is to develop defini-tions of family and familial roles that are somewhat less reliant onperformance. To do so, family law would give far greater leeway toparties to decide for themselves whether they constitute a family. Astate could develop numerous opt-in familial categories that wouldallow individuals and groups to determine whether to assume familialrights and responsibilities by registering for one of the categories.244To see how this might work in practice, consider the example of alesbian couple choosing to raise a child together but with the addi-tional help of a man who donated sperm informally.245 Under the cur-rent approach to nontraditional families, which insists on only twoparents, if the lesbian couple involves the man too much, they riskundermining the parental claims of the non-biological mother becausea court would see the family as consisting of the two biologicalparents.By contrast, an opt-in approach with numerous categories of\"family\" would allow the three adults to register their family form. Ifthey chose to be a family, then the law would treat them as such. Thiskind of opt-in regime is loosely analogous to the civil contracts thatgay and lesbian couples use to construct legal relationships in theabsence of formal recognition.246 The opt-in registry, however, would243 See supra Part II.B.2.244 See Erez Aloni, Registering Relationships, 87 TUL. L. REv. 573 (2013) (discussingsuch proposals and offering an alternative, registered contractual relationships, whichwould allow couples to choose their own level and type of commitment and then registerthat commitment with the state).245 See John Bowe, Gay Donor or Gay Dad?, N.Y. TIMES, Nov. 19, 2006, at E68(describing several such situations).246 See, e.g., Craig M. Fowler, New Issues and Strategies in Texas Family Law Cases, inSTRATEGIES FOR FAMILY LAW IN TEXAS 55, 58 (2012) (describing how same-sex couples inImaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 641NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWconfer the same benefits on all types of families, not elevating onefamily form over another. A traditional nuclear family would be alegal \"family\" just as a three-parent family would be a legal \"family.\"An opt-in regime with multiple categories would thus decenterthe importance of any one social front and also would side-step theintrusive judicial scrutiny that accompanies a court's determination ofwhether a functional family meets the dominant social front. It wouldthus ensure that all families receive the advantage of the hands-offapproach the state takes to formal families.Of course there are numerous obstacles to be addressed, such asthe limits, if any, on the different types of family forms, as well as thequestion of shared parental rights,247 issues that are beyond the scopeof this Article. Moreover, the process for defining the opt-in catego-ries would, itself, likely rely on performances, as legislators determinethe range of familial groupings that would be allowed. But this kind ofreliance on performance is somewhat less troubling as it does not sub-ject any one family to scrutiny, and also serves the broader interest offurthering pluralism by recognizing the inherent variety of contempo-rary family life.A different way to define familial categories more broadly is tocondition legal recognition on the subjective nature of the bondbetween the individuals, not the objective markers of conformity withthe social front of traditional families. This is not to say that the stateshould grant legal recognition to any relationship, however loose, butrather that the relevant legal inquiry should be into the closeness ofthe relationship between partners or between children and caregivers.It is the texture of these relationships that should matter, not the simi-larity to familiar social fronts.Consider how this might work in the judicial context. A courtwould still examine performance-indeed, there may be little else onwhich to rely-but the court would do so with a different eye. Insteadof comparing the performance of the would-be family member with adominant social front, the court would seek to understand this familyon its own terms. If the family felt strongly about Arbor Day but notMother's Day, for example, the question is whether the would-beparent was included in the celebration of Arbor Day. This unlikelyTexas, which does not permit such couples to marry, use private contracts to \"set out thevarious rights, duties, and financial provisions pertaining to the couple's relationship-i.e.,who owns what property, and whether there will be any children, whether they will beadopted or conceived by artificial insemination, and what the parental rights of eachpartner will be\").247 See Clare Huntington, Parents as Hubs, 94 VA. L. REV. IN BRIEF 45, 46-47 (2008)(describing the problems with multiple adults claiming legal rights to a child).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review642 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYexample highlights the individual nature of families; after all, it maywell be that for some family Arbor Day is the highpoint of the year.But when a court looks only at what other families do, and askswhether this family performs similarly, it misses the point of thisfamily. To be sure, this kind of inquiry may be challenging institution-ally.248 Neither legislatures nor courts are particularly well equippedto make these sorts of judgments. But the alternative of relying on theprevailing social front is even more unsatisfying.3. Rejecting Command PerformancesDivorce law is one area where family law has largely rejectedcommand performances. Before the 1970s, every state required aparty seeking a divorce to show that the other party had committedfault, such as adultery or cruelty. 249 But by the middle of the twentiethcentury, fault-based divorce proceedings had become a charade, withlitigants, lawyers, and judges all engaging in Kabuki theater. The lim-ited bases for divorce, combined with the need for evidence, led tomany fabricated claims of adultery.250 For example, lawyers wouldarrange for the wife, a private investigator, and a process server tofind the husband in a motel room with a scantily clad woman.251 Thiscottage industry led to newspaper articles, such as the famous 1934series in the New York Mirror, entitled \"I Was the 'Unknown Blonde'in 100 New York Divorces!\" 2 5 2 The ensuing court proceeding wouldunfold according to a literal script, with the lawyers reading from amimeographed list of questions and the clerk of court interrupting thelawyer if he deviated from the script.253The move away from fault-based divorce was motivated, at leastin part, by the recognition that divorce proceedings had become a248 See Goldberg, supra note 171 (discussing the reluctance of courts to engage in thiskind of analysis).249 See generally J. HERBIE DIFoNzo, BENEATH THE FAULT LINE: THE POPULAR ANDLEGAL CULTURE OF DIVORCE IN TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICA (1997).250 See NELSON MANFRED BLAKE, THE ROAD TO RENO: A HISTORY OF DIVORCE INTHE UNITED STATES 192-94 (1962) (providing examples of collusion between spouses tosatisfy the requirements of fault-based divorce); ALISON CLARKE-STEWART & CORNELIABRENTANO, DIVORCE: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES 9 (2006) (describing collusion notonly between spouses but also among lawyers and trial judges to circumvent the strictrequirements of fault-based divorce); DIFoNzo, supra note 249, at 9 (explaining that, whilestatutes and appellate courts continued to try \"to reduce the realm of fault in an effort toslow divorce,\" trial courts \"adopted a ministerial role\" and, \"[p]residing over charades offault, trial judges usually acted as registrars ratifying divorce plans worked out by theparties\").251 DIFoNzo, supra note 249, at 89.252 BLAKE, supra note 250, at 193.253 See id.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law ReviewMay 2013] 643NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWsham, sullying the reputation of all involved. 254 With the introductionof no-fault divorce, every state now allows parties to obtain a divorcewithout engaging in this charade.255 The standard in many states-\"irretrievable breakdown\" of the marriage 256-Would seem to invitejudicial scrutiny of the marital performance, but in practice, divorcesare generally granted on one party's demand. 257 This reform is anexcellent example of how family law can transition away from per-formance demands. 258But other areas of family law-notably the child welfaresystem-still rely on set scripts that reinforce dominant images of thefamily. Child welfare proceedings in family court have been describedas harried stages:In many jurisdictions, particularly those in large urban areas, thecourts are overwhelmed by the size of their caseloads: Overtaxedjudges hear \"lists\" of up to 100 cases a day, giving each case a max-imum of five minutes. Families are sworn in en masse at the bar ofthe court, with little sense that what they say to the judge thereafterconstitutes sworn testimony, rather than a free-for-all conversation.Judges bark at the parties, calling parents \"Mom\" or \"Dad,\" ratherthan by their names. Orders typically are entered without any artic-ulation of findings of fact, conclusions of law, or even a recitation ofthe relevant legal standards in justification. 259To prepare for these proceedings, parents are counseled abouthow to act before the court, the attorney for the child, and representa-tives of the social services agency. Indeed, a recent trend has been toassign a parent in the child welfare system a \"parent peer advocate\"254 See id. at 216 (describing such a recognition in New York).255 IRA MARK ELLMAN ET AL., FAMILY LAW: CASES, TEXT, PROBLEMS 267 (5th ed.2010).256 E.g., CONN. GEN. STAT. § 46b-51 (2009); Ky. REV. STAT. ANN. § 403.170 (LexisNexis2010); MONT. CODE ANN. § 40-4-107 (2011).257 See, e.g., ELLMAN ET AL., supra note 255, at 272-74 (describing the absence of mean-ingful judicial inquiry into the breakdown of the marriage).258 This is not to valorize divorce law. Related areas of the law, such as child custodydecisions, often involve command performances. For example, when custody is contested,many state courts will engage an expert, called a forensic evaluator in some states, N.Y.FAM. CT. Acr § 251 (McKinney 2009), and a child and family investigator in others, CoLO.REV. STAT. § 14-10-116.5 (2011), to make a recommendation about custody. Parents arethen required to perform parenthood for this expert, who sits in judgment about who is thebetter parent. Leslie Eaton, For Arbiters in Custody Battles, Wide Power and LittleScrutiny, N.Y.

TIMES, May 8, 2005, at ST9 (describing a personal experience of needingto prove to the custody evaluator that she was a \"good mother\"). This exacting scrutiny ofnon-intact families echoes a central theme of this Article-that traditional families areinsulated from many performance demands, at least in degree if not in kind.259 Emily Buss, Parents' Rights and Parents Wronged, 57 OHIO ST.

The pro-cess, with its rote roles and easy generalities, is not an effective inquiryinto the dispositive question of whether a child is safe at home.A far more meaningful process would engage parents in aproblem-solving approach to the family's well being.263 For example,family group conferencing has proven particularly effective at bothkeeping children safe and ensuring that parents address the realproblems in their lives that led to the abuse or neglect at issue.264Family group conferencing, a form of restorative justice is a legal pro-cess for resolving child welfare cases without relying on a family courtjudge as the decisionmaker. After a report of child abuse or neglecthas been substantiated, the state convenes immediate and extendedfamily members and other important people in the child's life, such asteachers or religious leaders. This group works together to decide howto protect the child and support the parents. Professionals repre-senting the state organize the meeting and share information, but onlythe family and community members actually sit down to devise theplan for protecting the child and addressing the issues facing the par-ents that led to the abuse and neglect. After the conference, partici-pants and the state work together to support the family and ensure thechild remains safe.Family group conferencing is far from scripted, and parents arenot processed like extras, nor held to a dominant social front that maynot accord with their community standards. Instead, each group'sengagement is unique and is tailored to a family's particular needs andcircumstances. A family group conference is an excellent means for260 See, e.g., CHILD WELFARE ORGANIZING PROJECT ET AL., THE SURVIVAL GUIDE TOTHE NYC CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM: A WORKBOOK FOR PARENTS BY PARENTS 25-32(2007), available at http://www.cwop.org/documents/survivalguide2007english.pdf (advisingparents how to act in front of investigating social workers).

Law ReviewMay 2013] 645NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWdoing so because it assumes that parents, and those around them, areexperts in their own lives and thus are well positioned to devise a solu-tion for the problems facing a particular family. As one advocate offamily group conferencing has explained, \"[tihe relationships betweenall the parties, and out of which the problems have arisen, are sonumerous and ever-changing, and so interconnected that it is folly tobelieve that outsiders to those relationships could ever 'know' them ina way that permits either accurate prediction or predictable interven-tion.\"265 Instead, the parties are in the best position to do So. 2 6 6Rather than rote performance and reductive role playing, an alterna-tive process can recognize individuation and see beyond a set drama.B. Denaturalization in PracticeTo illustrate the benefits of the denaturalizing framework, thisSubpart briefly sketches two examples: resolving the marriageequality debate without ratifying any particular social front, anddeveloping more responsive policies to address family violence.1. Marriage EqualityAs Part III argued, the debate over marriage equality is so con-tentious largely because both sides are vying for definitional control ofthe social front of marriage. When courts and legislatures decidewhether to permit same-sex couples to marry,267 they are, in effect,weighing in on the proper social front of marriage. A truly pluralisticfamily law would decide this important question without unduly deni-grating or devaluing any particular social front. A denaturalizingframework shows how to do so.In the courts,268 one reason why the cultural and political battlehas been exacerbated and not tempered is because, when extending265 Rupert Ross, Searching for the Roots of Conferencing, in FAMILY GROUPCONFERENCING: NEw DIRECTIONS IN COMMUNITY-CENTERED CHILD AND FAMILYPRACTICE 5, 13 (Gale Burford & Joe Hudson eds., 2000).266 See id.267 Courts were the first legal actors to extend the right to marry to same-sex couples.See, e.g., Goodridge v. Dep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941, 968 (Mass. 2003). Morerecently state legislatures have acted to recognize marriage equality. See, e.g., MarriageEquality Act, 2011 N.Y. Laws 749 (codified at N.Y. Dom. REL. LAw § 10-a (McKinney2011)); Act of Feb. 8, 2012, 2012 Wash. Sess. Laws 199 (concerning civil marriage anddomestic partnerships). Changes to state marriage laws have also come from ballot initia-tives, where individuals are voting directly on the social front of marriage. See, e.g.,CHARLES E. SUMMERS, JR., MAINE CITIZEN's GUIDE TO THE REFERENDUM ELECTION 3(2012), available at http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elecl2012/CITIZENS%20GUIDE.pdf.The focus of this Subpart, however, is on state actors and institutions, not individual voters.268 As this Article is going to press, two marriage equality cases are pending before theU.S. Supreme Court.

Law Review[Vol. 88:589646STAGING THE FAMILYthe right to marry, some courts have relied on the substantive dueprocess argument that marriage is a fundamental right that cannot bedenied to same-sex couples. 269 The problem with a substantive dueprocess analysis is that it invites an inquiry into the history and tradi-tion of the claimed right.270 By engaging in this kind of analysis, courtsare explicitly determining the proper social front of marriage, ele-vating one front at the expense of another.It is hardly surprising, then, that when courts decide that historyand tradition weigh in favor of extending marriage to same-sexcouples, social conservatives are offended and raise charges of judicialactivism. 271 Indeed, the two most visible state court decisions, whichboth relied on substantive due process, led to immediate politicalbacklash. The 2003 decision by the high court in Massachusetts wasthe precipitating factor in the rash of laws and constitutional amend-ments passed in 2004 limiting marriage to one man and one woman. 272And the successful Proposition 8 campaign in California in November2008 was a reaction against the California Supreme Court's decisionearlier that year to open marriage to same-sex couples.273Adopting a denaturalizing framework would allow a court toresolve the question of marriage equality without engaging in thedubious practice of choosing between contested social fronts. Thedenaturalizing framework begins with the proposition that marriage isHollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 786 (2012) (No. 12-144); United States v.

It has no greater claim as a natural category than any othersocial front.The next step in a denaturalizing approach is to ask whether lawsbased on the dominant social front are impermissibly discriminatory.As a matter of institutional competence, courts are much better suitedto the task of evaluating claims of equality and discrimination thanchoosing between contested social fronts. Moreover, there are consid-erable symbolic and substantive advantages to an equality analysis.Symbolically, an equal protection analysis acknowledges the stakes atplay for both advocates and opponents of same-sex marriage, but doesnot denigrate or elevate claims for tradition-that is, the dominantsocial front-in the process of upholding individual rights. Under anequality analysis, a court can arrive at a basis for supporting the rightfor same-sex couples to marry without explicitly choosing one socialfront over another, thus disparaging social conservatives who feel thattheir own public conception of marriage is threatened.Substantively, arguments based on equality sound in principles atthe heart of the American legal system and therefore may be morepersuasive than claims based on tradition. Indeed, one of the mostresonant arguments in the marriage equality movement has been thecomparison of domestic partnership regimes to racial \"separate butequal\" laws.274 These arguments immediately and intuitively illustratehow restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples is discriminatory.Admittedly, an equality analysis is not free from dominant per-formance demands. Equal protection analysis will require a court toidentify the classification-limiting marriage licenses to opposite-sexcouples-and then inquire into the state justification for this274 See, e.g., Governor Christine Gregoire, Marriage Equality Speech (Jan. 4, 2012) (onfile with the New York University Law Review) (\"While I understand the experiences ofracial minorities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans are not identical,laws that keep some Americans in a separate status are inherently unjust.\").

Regardless of the level of scrutiny,2 7 5 the judicial inquirywill focus on the nature of marriage for same-sex and opposite-sexcouples, asking why the state can allow it for one group but not theother. The benchmark for marriage will likely still be heterosexualperformance of commitment. Marriage equality advocates (for under-standable strategic reasons) will advance plaintiffs who act just likelong-term married couples, and courts will focus on the similaritiesand differences between the groups-a performance-based inquiry.But in an equality analysis the court is not overtly choosingbetween social fronts. The court is not saying that marriage is tradi-tional or marriage is more plural. Instead, a court would be espousinga thinner notion of marriage-that whatever its essential nature, itcannot be denied to a couple based on sexual orientation. In this way,the court is not defining the proper social front of marriage, butinstead is determining the permissible grounds for state classifica-tions. 276 The result will be the same, and social conservatives willlikely still feel a strong sense of loss, but the rationale for theloss-that equality demands equal access, not that marriage isX-respects pluralist values while still upholding the Constitution.If it is a legislature rather than a court deciding whether to extendmarriage to same-sex couples, then a similar analysis would apply. Alegislature may be better positioned institutionally to decide betweencontested social fronts, but given the strong views on the subject, a billwould likely garner greater support, and would risk less backlash, ifthe legislature used the denaturalizing framework to justify the newlaw. As described above, the framework moves the debate away fromwhat is \"natural,\" and instead focuses on the constitutional protec-tions due all members of our society. In other words, this approachrecognizes what is lost for social conservatives, but explains why thisloss is necessary.2. Family ViolenceA denaturalizing framework for family law would open the doorto a different policy response to family violence. An essential first stepis for policymakers to address the tendency of both the public andpolicymakers to focus on more positive images of the family whileblinding themselves to the darker side of familial interaction. It isimportant to unsettle the belief that family members do not abuse275 See, e.g., Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169, 180-85 (2d Cir.), cert. granted, 133S. Ct. 786 (2012) (No. 12-307) (holding that classifications based on sexual orientation aresubject to intermediate scrutiny).276 See id. at 185-88 (applying intermediate scrutiny to the Defense of Marriage Actwithout analyzing the meaning of marriage).Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U. Law Review649May 2013]NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEWtheir own children. Although some of this work has been done forphysical violence between adults and between parents and children, 277child sexual abuse remains a glaring hole, where the collective resis-tance to seeing family members as abusers continues to skew policy.Policymakers also must address the uneven, intersectional nature ofthis selective blindness, as embodied in the particularly strong resis-tance to viewing White, middle class, heterosexual family members asperpetrators. Policymakers thus must portray all families as potentialsites for child sexual abuse. 278There is a role for legal scholars as well, as contributors to anongoing dialogue about family violence and the role of family privacy.A robust response to child sexual abuse will almost certainly entailsome governmental involvement in the lives of families, even if onlythrough public service announcements and educational programs inschools. In the current political climate, such seemingly innocuousefforts may well trigger claims of an overly interventionist state.279Part of the resonance of these calls for family privacy is that they echoan understanding of the home as a place to suspend the performance.Scholars can help, then, by doing more than simply making rationalarguments about the multiple ways the state regulates the family.Scholars must also grapple with the emotional appeal of family pri-vacy and develop an equally resonant response.CONCLUSIONIf, as Holmes argued, \"The life of the law has not been logic; ithas been experience,\" 280 family life is experienced in the public eye.Iterated performances of family have a performative effect. In addi-tion to creating social meaning, they permeate all aspects of familylaw, shaping legal categories and informing broad swathes of doctrine.277 See LEIGH GOODMARK, TROUBLED MARRIAGE: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THELAW 1-4 (2012) (describing the efforts over the last forty years to move domestic violenceinto the sphere of public concern); MARTIN GUGGENHEIM, WHAT'S WRONG WITHCHILDREN'S RIGHTS 2 (2005) (describing the widespread view that children should be pro-tected from abuse inflicted by their parents).278 It is beyond the scope of this Article to explore specific policy changes, but for oneproposal addressing sexual abuse within the family, requiring the custodial parent to take aclass about warning signs of abuse and enroll the child in a prevention class, see RobinFretwell Wilson, Children at Risk: The Sexual Exploitation of Female Children afterDivorce, 86 CORNELL L.

Law Review650 [Vol. 88:589STAGING THE FAMILYAnd yet legal and political decisionmakers continue to hew tonaturalized definitions of familial categories, at tremendod% cost topluralism. This normative narrowing is particularly problematic inlight of the dramatic shifts in American families, where much family-like behavior now occurs outside the traditional legal family. If familylaw is the gatekeeper of legal recognition, the price of admission hasbecome conformity with the dominant social front.As this Article has demonstrated, identifying the performativenature of family law provides scholars and lawyers with a greaterrange of tools for both discerning and critiquing doctrine andfamilial regulation more generally. It also provides the basis for analternative framework for defining familial categories and familialroles-denaturalizing family law. It is not possible to step away fromperformance entirely, but an increased awareness of the place of per-formance is an essential step in exposing instances when legal analysisshades into policy preference, pulling back the curtain on purportedlyneutral family law. Recognizing the omnipresence of performancemay be an unsettling prospect, but it is also a productive means forthinking critically about how the state does and should regulate someof the most important aspects of our lives.Imaged with Permission of N.Y.U.

    "abstract": "For many critical aspects of family life, all the world truly is a stage. When a parent scolds a child on the playground, all eyes turn to watch and judge. When an executive’s wife hosts a work party, the guests are witness to traditional gender roles. And when two fathers attend a back-to-school night for their child, other parents take note of this relatively new family configuration. Family is popularly considered intimate and personal, but in reality much of family life is lived in the public eye. These performances of family and familial roles do not simply communicate messages to others. They are also central to the deep structure of family law. Drawing on sociological and feminist theory, this Article argues that iterated, everyday performances are performative — that is, they create and then maintain collective understandings of mother, father, child, and family itself. The law plays an integral role in this by imbuing the performances with legal salience to define the categories at the heart of family law. This Article terms this dynamic process “performative family law.” Aspects of this mutually constitutive relationship between performance and family law are deeply troubling, raising significant concerns for core areas of doctrine, policy, and theory. First, family law’s prevailing approach to defining familial categories is normatively narrowing because legal actors tend to give effect only to traditional, dominant images of the family despite seismic demographic changes in family form. Second, the obscuring effects of the public face of the family often warp the policies designed to address family violence, most notably child sexual abuse. Finally, by ignoring the pressure of performance, scholarly debates over the public-private divide are incomplete and have failed to explain why the concept of family privacy retains such enormous appeal. In response, this Article proposes a new framework for family law that decenters dominant performances and provides an alternative means to define familial categories and counter family violence. It is not possible or even desirable to eliminate performativity entirely, but it is important to resist its more troubling aspects. A denaturalizing framework promises a more pluralistic approach to the emerging demographic transformation of the family and deeper engagement with the variety of family life today",
