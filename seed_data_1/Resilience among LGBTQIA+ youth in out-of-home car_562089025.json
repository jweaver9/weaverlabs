Little is known about the ways through which LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care are resilient to these adversities. To date, a review study on resilience in this population is lacking. Objective: To map and synthesize the existing research on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care. Specific goals were to summarize and analyze 1) the general characteristics of the existing studies, and 2) the resilience resources found at the individual, relational, sociocultural, and ecological levels. Methods: We carried out a scoping review examining empirical published academic literature. Results: The 14 studies included in this scoping review indicated that resilience studies among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care are mainly qualitative, cross-sectional, US-based, and were centered on gay youth. Studies suggested that resilience resources were mostly focused at the socio/relational level (e.g., foster family acceptance) with fewer studies at the individual (e.g., LGBTQ positive identity), and community levels (e.g., LGBTQ centers). Importantly, no studies explored the interaction of resilience resources across these different domains. Conclusions: Resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care remains understudied and the results of this scoping review point to specific research gaps. Recommendations are provided for research, practice, and policy.   1. Introduction Despite the progress made in the past decades to protect and advance the human rights of LGBTQIA+ persons (Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual/Aromantic/Agender, and other sexualities and identities), severe and systemic human rights violations and abuses against this population remain persistent worldwide (UN Human Rights Council, 2015; United Nations. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2019). These violations of human rights against LGBTQIA+ persons are perpetuated through acts of discrimination, harassment, bullying, criminalization, stigma, and denial of services, among others (UN Human Rights * Corresponding author at: Grote Rozenstraat 38, 9712TJ Groningen, the Netherlands.

Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2019). The pervasive experiences of violence specific to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE), constitute severe sources of social stress that are associated with a constellation of negative health outcomes (Meyer, 2003). In particular, LGBTQIA+ children and youth placed in care by the child welfare system (CWS) constitute a vulnerable population at high risk for experiencing social, physical, and mental health dis-parities. These disparities experienced by LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care often stem from heteronormativity and cisnormativity (the systemic privilege of heterosexuality and cisgenderism over other forms of sexuality and gender identity) that stigmatize and marginalize their SOGIE (Mallon, 2019). Despite going through these experiences, LGBTQIA+ persons are resilient, they can sustain, regain, and improve their physical and mental wellbeing when faced with adversities (Meyer, 2015). Yet, the comprehensive forms of resilience among LGBTQIA+ populations, particularly among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, remain understudied. An examination of the forms of resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care would provide useful insights on how to improve their lives. 1.1. LGBTQIA+ research: from risk to strengths Research on LGBTQIA+ wellbeing has followed a risk-based approach, focusing mainly on individual-level negative outcomes (Russell, 2005). Less work has paid attention to how LGBTQIA+ youths overcome social stressors and healthfully adapt and thrive. For example, abundant research documents the myriad of health challenges experienced by LGBTQIA+ individuals (Bryant et al., 2020), such as substance abuse (Cabaj, 2014), sexual risk-taking (Herbst et al., 2008), self-injurious behavior (Davey et al., 2016), poor nutrition (Diemer et al., 2015), and increased likelihood of presenting a mental health disorder in their lifetime (Mustanski et al., 2010). Scholars have also proposed theoretical frameworks for understanding the effects of SOGIE-based stigmatization and/or marginalization on LGBTQIA+ health. Those theoretical frameworks are the Minority Stress Theory (MST) (Meyer, 2003) and the Gender Minority Stress Model (GMST) (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Testa et al., 2015). MST posits that LGBQ persons anticipate, experience, and internalize severe and pervasive forms of prejudice and violence because of their non-heterosexual status. These forms of social stressors are known determinants of negative mental and physical health. For example, a recent meta-analysis showed that experiences of minority stress were associated with negative mental health outcomes, especially depression, among LGB adolescents (Dürrbaum & Sattler, 2019). The MST has been expanded and applied to the understanding of the unique challenges experienced by transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) individuals and the impact on their wellbeing (Hendricks & Testa, 2012; Testa et al., 2015). The GMST examines the adverse experiences, such as physical and sexual violence, or internalized transphobia, affecting persons with a non-cisgender identity and expression (i.e., one's internal experience of gender is different from conventional or cultural expectations based on the sex that person was assigned at birth). The GMST also affirms that these stressful experiences affect non- cisgender persons' behavioural and mental health, including substance abuse, suicidal ideation and behaviors, and death (Hen-dricks & Testa, 2012). This risk-based approach has generated fruitful advancements in empirically highlighting LGBTQIA+ health disparities, but it has also overlooked how these risks are mitigated. Thus, research on resilience to better understand how these youths cope and thrive is necessary to inform prevention and intervention efforts to diminish health disparities. Resilience is commonly characterized as a “dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity (Cicchetti et al., 2000).” Early understandings of resilience-focused on an individual's traits, such as self-efficacy and self- esteem, that conferred protection from stressors and promoted healthy development (Cicchetti et al., 2000; Ungar et al., 2013). The construct of resilience evolved to underscore the importance of environmental resources such as families (e.g., family cohesion) neighborhoods (e.g., community safety), and broader socio-cultural contexts (e.g., employment opportunities), for an individual to overcome adversity within a multidimensional framework of resilience (Masten, 2014; Ungar, 2012; Ungar et al., 2013). These multidimensional models of resilience aimed to contextualize the complexity of the interplay between adversity and health more comprehensively (Masten, 2014; Ungar, 2012; Ungar et al., 2013). In the current scoping review, resilience is operationalized as a dynamic and multidimensional process of drawing from individual (e.g., optimism), relational (e.g., close social ties), sociocultural (e. g., social identity), and ecological (e.g., access to housing or community services) resources by any given person or community to regain, sustain, or improve their wellbeing in contexts of significant adversity (Ungar, 2011; Ungar & Theron, 2020). Resilience among LGBTQIA+ individuals remains understudied compared to the risk-based studies, limiting our understanding and ability to identify points of prevention and intervention for LGBTQIA+ individuals to overcome their adversities (De Lira & de Morais, 2018; Gahagan & Colpitts, 2017; Kwon, 2013; Lyons, 2015; Russell, 2005; Russell & Fish, 2019). Among the resilience resources identified in the literature, at the individual level, self-esteem, personal mastery, physical exercise (Freitas et al., 2017) are constructs shown to confer protection against depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts. At the relational level, having social support from family (Rivers & Cowie, 2006; Spencer & Patrick, 2009) and positive relationships with parents (Pearson & Wilkinson, 2013) are associated with fewer depressive symptoms, including greater self-esteem and general health status (Ryan et al., 2010). Social support from peers is known to buffer the effect of family rejection evidenced by lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, and internalized homonegativity (Parra et al., 2017). Among LGB youth, social support is associated with greater LGBTQ identity pride, and in turn, lower depression (Chang et al., 2021). At the sociocultural and ecological level, online and offline media (e.g., movies and social media) are shown to foster community building and to enable adaptive coping skills (Craig et al., 2015). Social connectedness (belonging to a social group) serves to promote individual LGBTQIA+ identity affirmation and provides ground to move from personal struggle to collective action (DiFulvio, 2011). Resilience studies among transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth have been especially scarce. Some of the studies on resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth do not include TGNC or they are represented in small numbers. Despite commonalities with R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 1056603sexual minority youth, the experiences of TGNC youth are different. For example, TGNC individuals might experience other forms of discrimination (i.e., not being able to access legal documents, being denied access to medical care, or not being able to access safe public restrooms) (Testa et al., 2015). Gender non-affirmation, when one's internal sense of gender identity is not affirmed by others, is another added stressor (Testa et al., 2015). Resilience resources might also be different. Research suggests that for TGNC youth, as well as for LGB youth, parent connectedness, social support, school safety and belonging, are important resilience factors that protect against adversities such as poor peer relations, victimization, discrimination and abuse, and substance abuse. Unique to TGNC youth, the ability to use and be addressed with one's chosen name and pronouns was highly beneficial (Tankersley et al., 2021). There is also evidence of gender-affirming resources such as hormonal and surgical treatment improving the mental health and quality of life of transgender adolescents (Mahfouda et al., 2019). Social support is especially relevant for TGNC youth. While TGNC youth perceive less social support from family than their non-transgender siblings (Factor & Rothblum, 2007), social support protects them from anxiety and depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation and behaviors (Valentine & Shipherd, 2018). Two review studies indicate that resilience among LGBTQIA+ individuals has mainly been focused on the individual level (e.g., self-esteem, self-efficacy, personal mastery), and less attention has been paid to relational, sociocultural, and ecological resources (De Lira & de Morais, 2018; Gahagan & Colpitts, 2017). A recent study on the utility of resilience frameworks to understand LGBTQIA+wellbeing concluded that multidimensional conceptualizations of resilience that consider individual, social, and structural factors and their interactions would prove more suitable for a comprehensive study of LGBTQIA+ resilience (Gahagan & Colpitts, 2017). Studies on the multidimensionality of resilience could shed light on the understudied cultural and systemic influences promoting or hindering the physical and mental well-being of LGBTQIA+ persons. This approach would also reduce the burdensome responsibility to over-come adversity that is often placed solely on the individual. Although the field is just beginning to understand the complexity of resilience, this research is lacking for LGBTQIA+ youths in out- of-home care. LGBTQIA+ youths are not only affected by SOGIE related stressors but also by their stressors related to being in out-of- home care. For example, LGBTQIA+ youths are mistreated in their out-of-home placements (Mallon, 1998, 2019), mistreatment coming often by peers and CWS professionals (Wilber et al., 2006). Thus, the goal of the current scoping review is to systematically present multidimensional resilience resources among LGBTQIA+ children and youth living in out-of-home care to understand which environments can sustain and improve their wellbeing. 1.2. Resilience in LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care The Child Welfare System (CWS) is a “group of services designed to promote the well-being of children by ensuring safety, achieving permanency, and strengthening families” (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2022). When the CWS encounters cases of child and youth maltreatment or with parents who cannot take care of them, it responds with measures that depend on the unique characteristics of the situation and of the CWS itself. Family separation is generally one of the last measures taken by the CWS, and it entails the placement of children and youth in alternative living arrangements (out-of-home care settings). For example, youth who are displaced from the home of their family of origin by the CWS might be placed in kinship care, family foster care, residential care, or family group homes. Children and youth in out-of-home care are subject to great adversities and are likely to experience several negative health outcomes. Youth in out-of-home care, especially in residential care, have high mental health challenges, educational difficulties, and neurodevelopmental disorders (Ford et al., 2007). Yet, studies indicate that these youths in out-of-home care show individual (e.g., orientation to the future, self-reliability), relational (e.g., father acceptance), and external (e.g., availability of caring relationships, providing educational support) resilience resources that help them mitigate their adversities (Davidson-Arad & Navaro- Bitton, 2015; Lou et al., 2018). Importantly, Lou et al. (2018) also conclude that although external factors are increasingly present in resilience studies, individual resilience persists as the main researched source of resilience, overlooking social and ecological dimensions. Research on the lives of LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care is incrementally growing (Kaasbøll et al., 2021) LGBTQIA+ children and youth are 2.5 times more likely to be in contact with the CWS when compared to their cisgender and het-erosexual peers (Baams et al., 2019; Dettlaff et al., 2018; Fish et al., 2019). Despite this disparity, LGBTQIA+ children and youth remain invisible to the system (Mallon, 2019). The few studies on the lives and experiences of LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of- home care have mainly focused on their adversities and their negative outcomes. Often LGBTQIA+ children and youth do not feel safe and affirmed in their out-of-home placements, they are exposed to negative and unwelcoming experiences such as harassment, violence, bullying, discrimination, lack of acceptance, and abuse, from their peers and care professionals (Capous-Desyllas & Mountz, 2019; Cossar et al., 2017; Gallegos et al., 2011; Mallon, 1998, 2019; McCormick et al., 2017; McCormick, 2018; Paul, 2020; Wilber et al., 2006; Wilson & Kastanis, 2015; Woronoff et al., 2006). Additionally, these youths also experience particular barriers to participating in decisions that affect their lives (González-Álvarez et al., in press). Moreover, LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of- home care are exposed to a compounded burden: the aforementioned stressors related to their SOGIE, as well as the intrinsic challenges of living in out-of-home care (e.g., being separated from their family and their original sources of social support). The intersecting stressors of LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care are related to several challenges posing risks to these youth's wellbeing. LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care experience less educational attainment, more substance use, and heightened mental health challenges (Fish et al., 2019); they are less satisfied with the out-of-home care services, more likely to have multiple placements, to experience homelessness, and experience heightened emotional distress when compared to their non- LGBTQIA+ counterparts (Wilson & Kastanis, 2015). Their experiences of family and caregiver rejection are significant contributors to their multiple placements in care of LGBTQ youth in foster care (Mountz & Capous-Desyllas, 2020). While recognizing the contri-butions of this pioneering area of research on LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, an important next step toward R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 1056604advancing research to address these disparities would be to focus on the multiple ways in which LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care navigate their challenges to regain, sustain or improve their wellbeing. Overall, few studies have addressed the resilience of this overrepresented and marginalized subpopulation of LGBTQIA+ youth. It is important to identify how resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care has been approached in research, and the resilience resources discovered at the individual, relational, sociocultural, and ecological levels to inform future research, practice, and policy. 1.3. Objectives To our knowledge, there are currently no scoping reviews or other comprehensive reviews on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care. We reached this conclusion after conducting a literature search on several databases (JBISRIR, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, PubMed, and Epistemonikos). Thus, the current study aims to map and synthesize the existing literature on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care to address the following general research question: “What does existing empirical research suggest about resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care?” In particular, the current study aims to address:  1) What are the general characteristics of the existing research studies (e.g., specific types of populations, study locations, theories, methodologies) on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care?  1. 2)What are the resilience resources among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care? 2. Method 2.1. Study design We carried out a scoping review, which is defined as “a form of knowledge synthesis that addresses an exploratory research question aimed at mapping key concepts, types of evidence, and gaps in research related to a defined area or field by systematically searching, selecting, and synthesizing existing knowledge” (Colquhoun et al., 2014). Our research process was informed by several methodological guidelines: the methodological framework for conducting scoping studies by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and further enhanced by Levac et al. (2010); and the manual for scoping reviews developed by The Joanna Briggs Institute (2015). The mentioned guidelines share the following six main stages/steps: identifying the research question; searching for relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and consulting with stakeholders. We followed all of these steps except for consulting with stakeholders, an optional step (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005), that we deemed unnecessary given that one of the coauthors has knowledge of policy and experience in the practice field in youth care and provided constant input. Additionally, we used the reporting guideline for scoping reviews, PRISMA-ScR (Tricco et al., 2018). 2.2. Eligibility criteria Given the limited research on LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, and the complexities of defining and approaching the concept of resilience, we decided to first retrieve all studies in LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care and then screen the whole articles for our construct of interest (resilience). Our inclusion criteria aimed to be as wide as possible to broadly scope the research on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care. 2.2.1. Population We remained current with the diversity of acronyms and terms used to refer to this population and their SOGIE. We did this by constantly informing ourselves of the latest discussions on terminology within the academic and the general population domains. Examples of alternative acronyms to LGBTQIA+ are LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQIA, MSM (men who have sex with men), GSM (gender and sexual minorities). Examples of terms encompassed in these acronyms are Lesbian, Gay, Homosexual, Bi, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Genderqueer, Intersex, Asexual, Aromantic, Agender. Although we consider that some of these terms might not be appropriate (e.g., homosexual) to refer to these populations (Henderson, 2019), we included them in our criteria to cover the full spectrum of SOGIE in the literature search. Age criteria were informed by definitions of the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs Youth (https://www. un.org/development/desa/youth/what-we-do/faq.html). Youth were persons between the ages of 15 to 24 and children were considered persons under the age of 14. We remained flexible with these age ranges to account for the variability among these def-initions by country, sociocultural, institutional, economic, and political factors. As we focused on the perspectives of LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, we only included studies with them as participants, or studies with both youth and professionals as participants. 2.2.2. Context The out-of-home care setting was the context of the studies on resilience in LGBTQIA+ children and youth. The modalities include kinship care, family foster care, residential care, or family group homes, among others. The concept and definition of out-of-home care can vary across cultures and countries, and we were open to variations in terms and definitions. Although our focus stayed on children R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     ChildAbuse&Neglect129(2022)1056605Fig. 1. Search strategy flowchart.  R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 1056606and youth in out-of-home care, we remained open to possibly including studies with LGBTQIA+ homeless children and youth in the following cases: they were living in shelters, Transitional Living Programs (TLP) or they referred previous experiences in out-of-home care. 2.2.3. Concept After we identified the literature on LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, we searched for the studies that offered insights on resilience among this group. For this purpose, we included studies that used the term resilience and offered findings on resilience resources. We referred to these studies as explicit resilience studies. Moreover, we also included studies that offered findings on individual, relational, sociocultural, and ecological resources that promote wellbeing in the context of adversity (e.g., social support, self-efficacy, relationships of acceptance, identification, and belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community), but did not use the concept resilience to refer to these results. We referred to these studies as implicit resilience studies. To better specify the inclusion criteria of the implicit resilience studies we adhered to our definition of resilience: the dynamic process of the individual or community drawing from individual (e.g., optimism), relational (e.g., close social ties), sociocultural (e.g., social identity), and ecological (e.g., housing, education, employment) resources to regain, sustain or improve their wellbeing in contexts of significant adversity (Ungar, 2011; Ungar & Theron, 2020). This broad definition allowed us to include a wider range of studies. 2.2.4. Type of studies We included empirical studies in peer-review published articles and empirical studies in doctoral dissertations. Research study approaches include qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-designs. 2.2.5. Time period Due to the scarcity of research on the topic of LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care, we decided not to set any publication time restrictions, thus allowing us to find the most publications possible. 2.2.6. Languages We included publications in English, Spanish, and Dutch because these are the native languages of the researchers on the team. We also included studies from as many countries as possible in efforts to counterbalance the dominance of western perspectives. 2.3. Search strategy and study selection process We designed and implemented a comprehensive and systematic search strategy. The following databases were included: PsycINFO, SocINDEX, ERIC, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and EMBASE. The final search strategies (search strings) are available in the online Supplementary Appendix. Researchers RG and MB searched for articles using the search strategies (search strings tailored to each database). We used a three-step search strategy conducted by two researchers of the team (anonymous initials) (The Joanna Briggs Institute, 2015). Step 1) Initial search of two online databases related to our topic or field (PsycINFO and SocINDEX). Upon realizing that most of the relevant articles retrieved were studies already known by the reviewers, we considered there was no need to search in these articles for extra search terms. Step 2) we used the previously identified keywords to search for more specific search terms in the thesaurus of each database and we then created search strings tailored to each database. Step 3) we searched in all included databases using the EBSCO platform. It is important to emphasize that this search included terms only on the population and context, but not on the concept, resilience. The initial search (which took place on 30th June 2020) resulted in 698 references which were exported to the systematic reviews web app Rayyan (https://www.rayyan.ai/) for a deduplication process. After removing duplicates, we ended up with 520 references. Afterward, we used two levels of screening for the remaining references. Level 1) “anonymous initials” used Rayyan to screen all titles and abstracts using all the inclusion criteria, except for the concept. This screening was performed independently, followed by a discussion between researchers (anonymous initials) to resolve the conflicting articles and reach an agreement. We excluded n = 425 articles during this step. These articles were excluded because they did not meet the criteria for population and context: no LGBTQIA+children and youth in out-of-home care (n = 420), were not peer review articles (n = 4), or were duplicated (n = 1). We ended up with 95 articles. We proceeded to locate and download the 95 full-text articles, 20 articles were not found even after contacting the authors. In Level 2, the remaining full-text articles (n = 75) were entirely read. The first author “anonymous initials” screened for studies including information on resilience resources. We excluded 61 articles which did not meet the inclusion criteria: followed a risk-based approach, meaning that the studies focused exclusively on negative outcomes (n = 13), focus on intervention or practical recom-mendations (n = 13), theoretical articles (n = 12), legal articles (n = 10), did not contain findings on resilience factor or processes (n =6), were not on LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care (n = 5), and were methodological articles (n = 3). Thirteen (n = 13) articles fit the inclusion criteria. In the end, references on the thirteen articles were revised to identify additional papers (snowballing), and an additional article (n = 1) was included. The final number of included studies was 14. For the details on the search strategy, see Fig. 1. 2.4.

Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 1056608population characteristics (e.g., in terms of SOGIE and age), context (e.g., type of out-of-home care), resilience approach (e.g., theoretical and methodological approaches), and findings (e.g., resilience resources). Taking these characteristics, we developed a standardized data extraction form, and the charting remained open to the addition of other characteristics that could emerge throughout the review process. 3. Results and discussion Table 1 presents the studies yielded from the search and screening procedure (N = 14). Following our research questions, we first present general characteristics of the research studies: study locations, populations, methodologies, and conceptualization of resil-ience. The findings on resilience resources are presented in a descriptive narrative and Tables (2). Findings are discussed regarding their implications for research and practice and compared with previous literature. 3.1. General characteristics of the research studies This section aims to answer our first research question: What are the general characteristics of the research studies (specific type of populations, study locations, theories, or methodologies) on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care? 3.1.1. Study locations All 14 studies were conducted in the United States (US). The predominance of a Western perspective in our understanding of resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care was clear. Given that all studies came from the same country, we decided to look at their more specific locations. Not all studies specified the locations of the out-of-home care placements where research teams drew their participants from. Study locations included the states of Atlanta, California, Michigan, New York, Texas, and Wisconsin. 3.1.2. Study populations 3.1.2.1. SOGIE. Studies included a diverse group of SOGIE identities. The most common identities were: LGBTQ (n = 7), where Q was sometimes used as questioning or queer; LGBT (n = 2); LG (n = 2); LGBPT (n = 1), where P refers to pansexual; LGBQ (n = 1); and one study (n = 1) exclusively focused on transgender and gender-expansive youth. Three studies did not include transgender or gender non-conforming youth (n = 3). 3.1.2.2. The CWS. Concerning the type of out-of-home care facilities, studies included youth with diverse experiences: currently in foster care (n = 4), formerly in foster care (n = 2), formerly involved in CWS (n = 1), aged out of foster care (n = 1), and living in out-of- home care facilities specifically developed for LGBTQ youth (n = 1). Five studies (n = 5) also included homeless youth living in temporary housing placements such as TLP (n = 1), TLP specially designed for LGBTQ youth (n = 1), shelter (n = 1), TLP and shelter associated with CWS (n = 1), and one (n = 1) study included homeless youth with previous out-of-home care involvement. In the US there are two types of TLP, those housing homeless youth, and TLPs created by the CWS for youths that have voluntarily remained in care beyond age 18. In summary, foster care and TLPs for homeless youth were the main type of out-of-home care in the studies reviewed. Only one (n = 1) study specifically delved into the experiences of LGBTQIA+ youth transitioning out-of-care. Future studies on out-of-care transition experiences are necessary, given the unique challenges associated with this complex process (Courtney et al., 2011; Samuels & Pryce, 2008). The five (n = 5) studies that included homeless youth confirm that youth often experience involvement with both the out-of-home care system and homelessness (Dworsky, 2013; Zlotnick, 2009). Although one study has explored resilience in homeless transgender and gender-expansive youth (Shelton et al., 2018), studies understanding the process of LGBTQIA+ youth resilience at the intersection of out-of-home care and homelessness are lacking. Only one (n = 1) study included the perspective of service providers mixed with the narratives of LGBTQ youth in shelters (Coolhart & Brown, 2017). Given the small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria, this study was included due to the important insights it provided on resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in care. Moreover, we separated as much as possible the experiences of youth from those of service providers. This limitation is addressed in the general discussion. 3.1.2.3. Age. Youths' ages ranged from 14 to 31 years old. One study (n = 1) did not specify participants' age. Another study (n = 1) youth and adults ages 18 to 31 years; this study was included in the current review because it reported participants' retrospective experiences in out-of-home care when they were younger.

Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 10566093.1.2.4. Race/ethnicity. The majority of studies included racially/ethnically diverse youth (n = 13); one study (n = 1) did not report on the race/ethnicity of the participants. In all studies but one (McCormick et al., 2016), youth of color were the majority in the samples. These numbers might reflect the overrepresentation of youth of color and ethnically diverse among LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care (e.g., Dettlaff et al., 2018; Wilson & Kastanis, 2015), and in some cases, the interest of researchers to highlight the extra challenges these youth experience at the intersection of sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and out-of-home care. 3.1.3. Study methodologies Most of the studies included in this scoping review were peer-reviewed published articles (n = 11) and the remainder were doctoral dissertations (n = 3). The majority of studies used a qualitative approach (n = 10) and fewer studies used a quantitative (n = 2) or mixed-design (n = 2) approach. All qualitative studies used interviews as a primary method of data collection, and only one (n = 1) study used focus groups. Quantitative studies made use of surveys (a set of questionnaires with its own analysis plan) (n = 1), and individual questionnaires (n = 1). Mix-design studies used surveys and interviews (n = 2). Overall, most of the studies used qualitative approaches to explore resilience, which are known to be particularly advantageous for understanding resilience among complex so-ciocultural elements in marginalized populations (Ungar, 2003). To a lesser extent, quantitative and mixed-design studies were identified. Such methodological approaches can complement qualitative findings and further the field, for example, by quantifying the degree of protection conferred by different resilience resources and helping establish a clearer relation among stressors, sources of resilience, and wellbeing. Cross-sectional study designs were most frequently used in the reported studies (n = 12), and only one study (n = 1) was longitudinal. Although not diminishing the contributions of cross-sectional studies, the reliance on data from a single time- point can obscure our understanding of resilience as a dynamic and temporal process (Cicchetti et al., 2000). Prospective studies could advance the field substantially. 3.1.4. Resilience conceptualization Fewer than half (n = 6) studies included in this scoping review used the term resilience either in their research question, theoretical frameworks, method, or results. We refer to those studies as “explicit resilience studies” (Banghart, 2013; Capous-Desyllas & Mountz, 2019; Coolhart & Brown, 2017; Forge, 2012; Mountz et al., 2018; Robinson, 2018). The majority of studies (n = 8) reported findings on individual, relational, sociocultural, or ecological resources that foster wellbeing in the context of significant adversity, but those studies did not use the term resilience to name these findings. We refer to those studies as “implicit resilience studies” (Erney & Weber, 2018; Forge et al., 2018; Gallegos et al., 2011; Mallon et al., 2002; McCormick et al., 2016; Nolan, 2006; Paul, 2018; Ragg et al., 2006). A deeper analysis of how studies conceptualized and measured resilience was beyond the goals of this scoping review. Nonetheless, we highlight some important observations. Only one (n = 1) of the six studies explicitly naming resilience included a theoretical framework of resilience (e.g., Saleebey's resilience theory in Banghart, 2013). Notably, only two (n = 2) of these six studies explicitly operationalized resilience (Coolhart and Brown, 2017; Mountz et al., 2018). Most of the studies that examined resilience implicitly did not use any theoretical framework for their studied constructs (e.g., social support, relationships of acceptance), except for Paul (2018) Table 2 Resilience resources per ecological level.

R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 10566010who used the “Theory of youth mentoring” in their study of social support. The lack of theoretical perspectives or clear operational definitions of resilience hinders our understanding of this multifaceted construct and its utility for informing prevention and inter-vention efforts. We recommend that future studies clearly operationalize the construct of resilience and guide their work through theoretical frameworks of resilience. 3.1.5. Resilience resources We identified resilience at several ecological levels. Study findings were categorized into three broad levels of resilience: 1) in-dividual level, 2) social/relational level, and 3) community level. Table 2 presents resilience resources per ecological level. 3.1.5.1. Individual level 3.1.5.1.1. Self-relying attitudes or beliefs. Only four (n = 4) studies reported findings on individual resilience resources (e.g., Banghart, 2013; Capous-Desyllas & Mountz, 2019; Forge, 2012; Mountz et al., 2018) specific to youth characteristics or individual processes that youth used to cope with adversities. Banghart (2013) indicated that LGBTQ youth aging out of foster care experienced significant barriers to access to housing, education, and employment. Youth reported navigating these adversities with the use of self- relying attitudes or beliefs such as “keep moving forward,” and “never giving up.” Self-relying attitudes, as a form of resilience, have been described as individual resources among diverse populations. For example, a sense of mastery (the extent to which an individual believes they are in control of their life circumstances) is known to reduce depressive and trauma symptoms in transgender youth (Grossman et al., 2011) and is associated with other several protective factors in LGB individuals (De Lira & de Morais, 2018). Yet, one (n = 1) study (Forge, 2012) did not find evidence for the mitigating effects of self-efficacy between the link of stressors (abuse and victimization) on wellbeing among LGBT homeless youth in a TLP. 3.1.5.1.2. LGBTQIA+ positive identity. A couple of studies (n = 2) found individual resources specifically related to youth SOGIE. Capous-Desyllas and Mountz (2019) and Mountz and colleagues (2018), reported that LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care engaged in a personal journey of creating a positive SOGIE identity. This process helped them to move from their SOGIE-related shame and stigma to pride, empowerment, and self-acceptance. The role of intersectionality was clear in Mountz and colleagues (2018) such that youth acknowledged their several identities in terms of race, ethnicity, and SOGIE, which youth described as helpful to understanding and appreciating their whole selves. 3.1.5.1.3. Spirituality and religious beliefs. Particularly for TGNC former foster youth, spirituality and religious beliefs (Mountz et al., 2018) were important to find self-acceptance and emotional support amidst a transphobic environment. Religious beliefs were central for some youth's ability to cope despite youth's experiences of discrimination within their religious context. The complexity of religion and faith as both sources of protection or adversity has also been documented among Black LGB adults (Walker & Longmire- Avital, 2012) and young refugees (Sleijpen et al., 2015). Resilience is highly dependent on physical, cultural, and temporal contexts; thus, it is possible that resilience factors such as religion, at some point or context, can also act as adversity in a different situation (Ungar et al., 2013; Ungar, 2008). 3.1.5.1.4. Art and journaling, and perspective-taking. Capous-Desyllas and Mountz (2019) found that creative processes such as art and journaling, and perspective-taking (the ability to put the past in the past) helped LGBTQIA+ youth formerly in foster care to heal and overcome mental health and substance abuse problems. 3.1.5.2. Socio/relational level. Social relationships and the support of these relationships were the most studied ways of resilience. Eleven (n = 11) studies provided findings on resilience factors at the socio/relational level (Banghart, 2013; Capous-Desyllas & Mountz, 2019; Erney & Weber, 2018; Forge et al., 2018; Forge, 2012; Gallegos et al., 2011; Mallon et al., 2002; McCormick et al., 2016; Paul, 2018; Ragg et al., 2006; Robinson, 2018). These studies offered insights into the ways youth's relationships with care pro-fessionals, peers, friends, family, and others provided them with resources to withstand adversities. We have clustered social/relational resources in two main categories: studies that explored social support more generally, and studies that focused on more specific types of relationships and their support. 3.1.5.2.1. Social support. Banghart (2013) reported that for some LGBTQ youth aging out of foster care, formal services to secure housing, education, and employment were not available. For these youth, seeking and creating their own social support systems with friends and family (informal sources of support), was critical for securing housing, education, and employment. Moreover, some youth who could access formal services at out-of-home care agencies realized that their relationships with care workers while seeking services were more relevant than the services themselves. Yet, youth did not elaborate on what made those relationships so important. Care workers were also supportive of youth LGBTQ identities by reacting in affirmative ways when youth disclosed their SOGIE status. Forge et al. (2018) reported that LGBTQ youth with previous CWS involvement and who were experiencing homelessness were more likely to identify at least one care professional as their source of support, compared to heterosexual cisgender youth. Yet, in another study Forge (2012) could not test the effect of social support as a mitigator of stressors (sex risk behaviors, victimization, and abuse) on youth wellbeing (substance use, self-harm, and mental health) among LGBT homeless youth. Paul's (2018) findings showed that most LGBTQ youth transitioning out of foster care identified social workers as a source of support over other types of care pro-fessionals or relationships. Although most of the youth received financial and/or emotional support to transition out of foster care, only about half of the youth received support on LGBTQ-specific needs such as help to understand and navigate their SOGIE. Erney and Weber (2018) showed that the permanency and safety of LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care highly depended on maintaining an uninterrupted connection with their family members. Conversely, Mallon and colleagues (2002) demonstrated that some LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care placements, kept distance from their families, mainly due to the little or no support they R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 10566011received from their families of origin. Instead, youths created relationships of support with other adults, mentors, or people with whom they did not have biological or any formal ties (fictive kin). Relationships less explored in the literature were those of peers and friendships. Capous-Desyllas and Mountz (2019) found that for LGBTQ youth formerly in foster care to embrace their LGBTQ iden-tities, affirming relationships with peers and romantic relationships were critical. Strong, meaningful, and SOGIE affirming re-lationships aided LGBTQIA+ youth to navigate daily struggles, which further bolsters the importance of social support as a buffer against stressors among LGBTQIA+ individuals (De Lira & de Morais, 2018; Grossman et al., 2011; Tankersley et al., 2021). Although literature among LGBTQ youth shows the protective effects of peer support (“Author Citation”) and family acceptance (Ryan et al., 2010), few of the studies included in this scoping review focused on support from family, peers, and friendships on LGBTQIA+ youths in out-of-home care. Future research is warranted on the protective role of these relationships, as forms of resilience, for LGBTQIA+youths in out-of-home care. 3.1.5.2.2. Care professionals and foster parents. Gallegos et al. (2011) documented that all LGBQ youth residing in foster care reported the need to conceal their sexual orientation from others, including care professionals. Nevertheless, most LGBQ youths felt that their social workers were supportive of their needs and knew where to refer them to in case they needed services related to their SOGIE. Ragg and colleagues (2006) identified care workers' competencies that had a positive effect on the identity development of gay and lesbian youth in foster care. Moreover, these care workers helped them to mitigate their experiences of vulnerability, stigmati-zation, and rejection related to their sexual orientation. Three main competencies were reported: 1) empowering youth and advocating for them; 2) validation of youth as individuals, and 3) workers' acceptance. Mallon and colleagues (2002) showed that LGBTQ youth considered care staff members important for them. Those youth perceived these staff members as permanent connections that offered support and guidance throughout their lives. Regarding the role of foster parents in the positive development of LGBTQ youth, McCormick and colleagues (2016) explored how accepting foster families supported their LGBTQ youth. Findings showed that accepting families: 1) empowered youth and intervened when youth were mistreated; 2) helped youth to connect with affirming peers and other LGBTQ youth; and 3) upheld the same standards about dating, physical affection, and romantic partners as with straight cisgender youth. Robinson (2018) presented the story of an LGBTQ young person living in a TLP who could explore, understand and accept their SOGIE due to living with an accepting foster family. The characteristics/skills of foster parents found in the aforementioned studies complement and align with the findings of Schofield et al. (2019) indicating that foster parents' acceptance, cooperation, family membership, availability, and sensitivity were critical qualities to providing good care to LGBTQ youth in foster care. Supportive relationships with care professionals and foster parents were among the most studied types of relationships among LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care (Gallegos et al., 2011; Mallon et al., 2002; McCormick et al., 2016; Ragg et al., 2006; Robinson, 2018). These studies highlighted the enormous capacity of care professionals and foster parents to accept and positively influence LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care. 3.1.5.3. Community level. Seven studies (n = 7) shed light on resilience resources at the community level (Banghart, 2013; Capous- Desyllas & Mountz, 2019; Coolhart & Brown, 2017; Erney & Weber, 2018; Mountz et al., 2018; Mallon et al., 2002; Nolan, 2006). These studies found that access to institutional or systemic services in the community helped LGBTQIA+ youth to overcome challenges and increase their wellbeing. These services were in some cases general services such as preparation programs to find a job, housing, and education, and in other cases, they were services specific to their SOGIE, such as LGBTQ centers and trans-affirming organizations. 3.1.5.3.1. General services. LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care struggle to access basic services (e.g., education, health, and employment). Systemic barriers such as discrimination based on their SOGIE, race/ethnicity, socio-economic class, and mental health among others (Conron & Wilson, 2019) prevent LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care access basic needs. Banghart (2013) found that LGBTQ youth who had aged out of foster care had enormous barriers to secure housing, education, and employment. LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care highly benefited from access to formal professional preparation programs such as scheduled training to find jobs and housing provided by care workers. These formal services taught youth relevant skills to live independently. Formal programs which continued after aging out of care such as extended foster care services were also helpful. Capous-Desyllas and Mountz (2019) found that for LGBTQ former foster youth, access to education was an important way to overcome their adversities, and that these efforts empowered these youths to achieve their goals of a better future. However, not all LGBTQ former foster youth could access education, the authors posited that support programs to finance youth's education was crucial for their wellbeing. These results are in line with evidence suggesting that the availability of institutional resources is vital for youth's wellbeing; especially when services match these youth's specific marginalized identities and needs (Betancourt, 2008; Ungar & Theron, 2020). 3.1.5.3.2. SOGIE specific services. Coolhart and Brown (2017) reported that for LGBTQ homeless youth in shelters, LGBTQ centers were a pivotal resource of resilience against a backdrop of mistreatment, discrimination, and violence. LGBTQ youth centers func-tioned as these youth's main source of support. Workers at these centers advocated for LGBTQ youth and created a more positive experience for them in the shelters. Moreover, LGBTQ centers were a means to access shelter services. Erney and Weber (2018) developed best practice standards for LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care, based on youth input. Access to appropriate mental and behavioural health care services, such as SOGIE inclusive providers, was key for mitigating the effects of bullying and commercial and sexual exploitation. SOGIE inclusive providers affirmed youth's intersecting SOGIE and race/ethnicity social location. LGBTQ youth in out-of-home care indicated that staff in TLPs connected them with SOGIE-supportive employers, and these connections aided their transition to an independent life. Mountz and colleagues (2018) showed that trans-affirming organizations and community groups connected transgender and gender-expansive former foster youth with people who accepted them and served as positive role models. These organizations were especially helpful when these supportive relationships regarded youth needs at their intersecting identities, R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 10566012which also included trans-affirming and immigrant supportive services. Access to the LGBTQIA+ community and SOGIE-specific services is essential for LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care to help these youth meet their own specific needs and improve their wellbeing. The beneficial impact of these SOGIE-specific services on the wellbeing of LGBTQIA+ individuals is corroborated by previous research (e.g., Herrick et al., 2014; Sandfort et al., 2015; Shilo et al., 2014). Studies exploring other community resources such as collective cultural identity, engagement, and social activism, lacked in our review and certainly warrant future attention (De Lira & de Morais, 2018; DiFulvio, 2011). Finally, the studies by Mallon and colleagues (2002) and Nolan (2006) examined the effects of out-of-home care facilities spe-cifically developed for LGBTQ youth on their wellbeing. Mallon and colleagues (2002) reported that youth living in two LGBTQ- affirming child welfare agencies felt that their safety was greatly improved compared to other placements despite experiencing challenges specific to permanency and mental health problems. Nolan (2006) studied the effects of a LGBTQ affirming TLP on the outcomes of educational and employment success, but due to the design of the study, it was not possible to evaluate the actual benefit of the program. More recent studies evaluated the benefits of specific interventions for LGBTQ in foster care and their families, such as the program Recognize, Intervene, Support, Empower (RISE) (Lorthridge et al., 2018), or relationship-building tools (Salazar et al., 2018). Although these studies were not included in our review because they were focused on interventions, we encourage further studies to summarize and analyze their findings. 4. General discussion and conclusions This scoping review presents the first known study mapping resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care. Among the strengths of this review, our study used a broad scoping methodology that allowed the consideration of a large body of research. Moreover, we used the multidimensional model of resilience by Ungar and Theron (2020) to organize and analyze the findings. This review highlights several gaps in resilience research among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care. The main identities represented in this review were those of gay youth; the perspectives of lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and gender non-conforming youth were scarce. The field has a complete lack of knowledge about the experiences of asexual and aromantic identities (a broad spectrum of sexualities characterized by the absence of sexual desire and romantic feelings respectively) and intersex (refers to a wide range of biological variations that do not fit into the conventional binaries of male/female) youth in out-of-home care. Studies with these populations are needed to comprehend the diverse experiences of the whole LGBTQIA+ community. Moreover, although most studies included youth of color and racially/ethnically diverse youth, more generally, these studies fell short in exploring the complexities of how race/ ethnicity and SOGIE intersect in their experiences of resilience. A remarkable finding of our study was the total dominance of US-based studies in this field of study. No research outside the US has been conducted on resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care. The CWS in the US is shaped by particular political, cultural, and economic forces that differentiate its CWS from other systems around the globe (Fluke & Merkel-Holguin, 2019). While our results point to important resilience resources among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care and the characteristics and gaps of its research, we acknowledge their special applicability to a US context and the limitations to extrapolate it to other countries. In addition, not only is our knowledge-based solely on one country but it is also constructed on the experiences of youth in urban settings. Further studies in countries other than the US, and rural settings, are needed to obtain a broader cultural and social understanding of resilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care. The multidimensionality of resilience means that different resilience resources work interactively at several levels (e.g., individual, relational, community) simultaneously (Ungar, 2008; Ungar & Theron, 2020). Unfortunately, most of the reviewed studies focused on resilience at only one or two different levels. When findings of the reviewed studies were multidimensional, they did not fully explore the ways resources interacted with each other across levels to foster resilience. For example, an important question left unanswered was to understand how self-relying strategies, relationships of support, and access to institutional services interact with one another to help LGBTQ+ youth work through their adversities. Future research establishing the interaction of resilience resources at different levels would provide a broader and clearer picture of resilience that could inform prevention and intervention efforts. Moreover, it is worth noting that the results of our study cannot be generalized and should be carefully evaluated due to the exploratory nature of our research, which for example did not assess the quality of the studies included. Further studies more specific to elements of resilience, such as (SOGIE-specific services and social activism), and systematic reviews on resilience are also needed to bolster existing findings and further the field. The current scoping review can inform recommendations for care professionals, foster parents, families, and relevant stakeholders to promote the resilience of LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care and to prevent and eliminate adversities. For example, 1) Care providers can create safe and affirmative environments; not perpetuate or tolerate discrimination or violence in all its forms in out-of- home care services; and affirm their SOGIE, by encouraging youth to express their identities and orientations, and respecting their pronouns. 2) Care providers can also cultivate a sense of self-mastery, self-care, and hope for the future; and encourage LGBTQIA+youth to engage in activities that help build and maintain supportive relationships that can help them navigate challenges to obtain optimal wellbeing. 3) Those relationships should consider LGBTQIA+ youth's diverse experiences, including their SOGIE, race/ ethnicity, mental and physical health, religious background, and socio-economic condition. 4) Refer youth to formal programs that help them secure basic services such as education, housing, employment, and mental and physical health care, within and when they leave the CWS. 5) Create and refer youth to SOGIE-related services such as LGBTQ community centers and trans-affirming organi-zations that address their specific needs. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers have the responsibility of developing studies, programs, and policies that focus on resilience not only at the individual level, but also at the relational and social domains, which include social support, access to R.G. Álvarez et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Child Abuse & Neglect 129 (2022) 10566013institutional services, social acceptance, community building, and affirming practices. These efforts could help reduce the health inequalities experienced by LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care. Furthermore, for resilience research to truly take a social justice approach, knowledge must be co-created along with studied individuals and communities, aim to dismantle social inequalities; and empower participants to take control, whenever possible, of their wellbeing (Hart et al., 2016). LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care are subjected to numerous ways of violence rooted in pervasive homophobia, transphobia, racism, and other systemic forms of discrimination in societies, cultures, and institutions. Although most research among LGBTQIA+youth in out-of-home care has centered on describing their adversities and negative outcomes, little research has focused on their capacity to use individual, relational, and community resources to overcome their challenges. Our study findings suggest that youth in out-of-home care can thrive through the unique adversities they are subjected to through, for example, friendships and romantic relationships, foster family acceptance, LGBTQ centers, and developing an LGBTQ positive identity. Resilience research can create a knowledge base from which to develop policies and practices that advance the human rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals, consequently, creating a more just society.

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch on the experiences of LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care has mainly focused on these youth's adversities and the resulting negative impact on their wellbeing. Little is known about the ways through which LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care are resilient to these adversities. To date, a review study on resilience in this population is lacking.ObjectiveTo map and synthesize the existing research on resilience among LGBTQIA+ children and youth in out-of-home care. Specific goals were to summarize and analyze 1) the general characteristics of the existing studies, and 2) the resilience resources found at the individual, relational, sociocultural, and ecological levels.MethodsWe carried out a scoping review examining empirical published academic literature.ResultsThe 14 studies included in this scoping review indicated that resilience studies among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care are mainly qualitative, cross-sectional, US-based, and were centered on gay youth. Studies suggested that resilience resources were mostly focused at the socio/relational level (e.g., foster family acceptance) with fewer studies at the individual (e.g., LGBTQ positive identity), and community levels (e.g., LGBTQ centers). Importantly, no studies explored the interaction of resilience resources across these different domains.ConclusionsResilience among LGBTQIA+ youth in out-of-home care remains understudied and the results of this scoping review point to specific research gaps. Recommendations are provided for research, practice, and policy",
