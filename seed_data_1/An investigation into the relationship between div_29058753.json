University of Cape Town   iii   AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND PERFORMANCE   AN EMPIRICAL STUDY IN A CORPORATE SOUTH AFRICAN ORGANISATION   A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used to answer the following three questions:  1) What is the effect of demographic variables on diversity and inclusion?  2) Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces?   3) What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa?  The research was conducted in a division of a multinational corporation in South Africa.  The quantitative analysis was run using the InclusionIndex™ survey to get a measurement of diversity and inclusion in the organisation.  The qualitative methodology included semi-structured interviews and focus groups.  Questions one and two were tested empirically using a combination of analysis of variance and structured equation modelling.  Question three was answered using the consolidated findings of the quantitative and qualitative components of the InclusionIndex™ survey, the semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and insights from related literature.   The research found that diversity and inclusion need to be driven at organisational, interpersonal and individual levels to achieve the benefits of a diverse and inclusive workforce.  Components that are critical in order for the strategy to be successful at an organisation level are: ‘senior management’, ‘organisational belonging’, ‘dialogue’, ‘recruitment’, ‘promotion, progression and development’, and the ‘organisation climate’ created through HR processes and policies.  At an interpersonal level, they are: ‘acceptance and respect’, ‘immediate manager engaging employees with dignity’, ‘trust and recognition’, University of Cape Town   iv   ‘engagement in terms of empowered decision-making and access to information’, and finally, the ‘employee’s engagement with the company’s vision and values’.  The individual component involves an individual’s ‘personality’, ‘locus of control’, ‘confidence’, ‘power’ and ‘self-esteem’.   The structured equation models suggested that perception of diversity and inclusion is affected by an individual’s race, position in the company, the location the individual is based at, and department the individual works in at a confidence level of 95%.  Analysis showed that while age and tenure did not produce statistically significant findings on the structured equation model (SEM), these groups showed a stronger relationship with inclusion than gender, sexual orientation, disability, and religion; which showed a non-significant relationship with inclusion when considering all the variables simultaneously.  Further, individual performance was seen to be affected by individual perception of inclusion at a confidence level of 95%.

TownUniversity of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    1  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION   Despite some good intentions, true transformation1 in South African organisations has been compromised by the lack of focus of diversity efforts.  Human (1996b:46) found that many organisations are ‘playing the numbers game2 and are looking for quick fix solutions to their management of diversity challenge’.  Such solutions frequently take the form of workshops or interventions which are not incorporated into overall strategic and human resource management processes.  Effective affirmative action requires fundamental changes to organisational culture and the way in which people are managed3.  This is supported by Thomas, A. (2002:241) who asserts that ‘employment equity and affirmative action have not been regarded as a strategic business issue and accordingly, there has been a lack of management commitment to the process at all levels’.  South African organisations are failing to address their transformation imperatives because their diversity management focus is misdirected.  Many organisations are focusing on achieving quotas and equity targets that assist compliance with legislation but do not address fundamental organisational and individual change (Booysen, 2007a), which show commitment to the transformation agenda and the benefits thereof.   As Khanyile and Maponga (2007) and April and April (2009) outlined, groups of employees in South Africa are unhappy, yet the measures that are in place do not facilitate change.  Lorbieki and Jack (2000:17) suggest that ‘diversity management is introduced with ostensible aims, including: increasing the rates of participation of women and ethnic minorities, improving career prospects for these people, incorporating wider perspectives                                                1 ‘Apartheid systematically and purposefully restricted the majority of South Africans from meaningful participation in the economy’(Department of Trade and Industry, South Africa 2003:3).  To counteract this, ‘Government’s objective is to achieve this vision of an adaptive economy characterised by growth, employment and equity by 2014’ (Department of Trade and Industry, South Africa 2003:3).  Transformation involves change, which is enabled through actions which organisations undertake to support the achievement of this objective.  2 An objective of the Employment Equity Act, No. 55 of 1998 is to ‘redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups, to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational categories and levels in the workforce’ (Department of Labour, South Africa, 1998).  ‘The numbers game’ refers to the ongoing equity recruitment focus that organisations have in order to ensure they meet equity representation requirements of the Act; but also refers to the perception that adherence is driven by little more than legislative compliance. 3 While affirmation action or employment equity (as it is called in South Africa) focuses on ensuring that the workplace is representative of the local demographics; diversity management in a multicultural environment is a comprehensive strategic process which encompasses employment equity, but essentially ensures that the organisational culture is inclusive, such that the benefits of a diverse environment can be utilised to enhance business performance. University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    2 into decision-making processes and helping organisations reach new, and formerly untapped, markets.’  They find that the success in doing this has been erratic.    This study investigates the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in a corporate South African environment.  ‘Diversity,’ in the context of this research, is an employee base that is representative of the differences apparent in the broader society (Wah, 1999). ‘Inclusion’ involves acknowledgement and utilisation of these individual differences in their work environment, such that the individual is engaged and his/her performance is subsequently enhanced (Giovanni, 2004; April, Katoma & Peters, 2009).  The focus on inclusion involves a departure from the diversity management prevalent in most South African organisations, which mostly involves recruitment of racially and gender diverse individuals (Human, 1991, 1996a).  An inclusive or multicultural environment also involves a departure from assimilation environments (Booysen, 2007a) where diverse individuals join an organisation and adopt the majority culture in favour of fitting in.  Assimilation usually involves casting aside uniqueness and individuality, which could bring forth creativity or different ways of doing things if allowed to exist and prosper (Giovanni, 2004).  This is to the individual’s detriment as arriving and assuming a new identity is tiring and stressful, and means that the individuals feel that they are not accepted or valued for who they are (April & April, 2009).  From a team perspective, the wealth of ideas generated from diverse individuals with unique backgrounds and insights is compromised in preference of a dominant voice or view that is acceptable, and conforms to norms of the organization (Stuber, 2002, 2005a; De Wit & Greer, 2008).  From an organisation’s perspective, it means that business opportunities resulting from problem-solving, creativity and innovation from functioning multicultural teams are forfeited (Page, 2007a); and openness to change and effectiveness is compromised (Stuber, 2005a).   1.1 A BRIEF HISTORY OF SOUTH AFRICA South African history has made the topic of diversity a challenging and emotive one within its communities and organisations.  Racial segregation in South Africa started its political journey circa 1912 with the establishment of the African National Congress (Chokshi, Carter, Gupta, Martin & Allen, 1995).  Apartheid, which was in place from approximately 1948 to 1994, was a formal system of legal racial segregation enforced by the National Party University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    3 Government of South Africa.  Following the general election of 1948, the National Party set in place its programme of Apartheid, with the formalisation and expansion of existing policies and practices into a system of institutionalised racism and White domination (Anonymous, 2007a).  Twenty four forms of legislation came about in support of the segregation, which was finally abolished in 1994, after 3 years of negotiations and the first all-race, democratic elections, which culminated in the establishment of a plural democracy (Chokshi, Carter, Gupta, Martin & Allen, 1995).  This background has resulted in numerous obstacles for ‘diversity management’ in South Africa.  The South African government has instituted numerous acts in support of transformation, the most important being the Employment Equity Act, No. 55 of 1998 (Republic of South Africa, 1998a), and the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) Act, No. 53 of 2003 (Republic of South Africa, 2003).  The Employment Equity Act (Republic of South Africa, 1998a) aims to achieve equity in the workplace by promoting equal opportunity and fair treatment in employment through the elimination of unfair discrimination and implementing affirmative action measures to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups, and to ensure their equitable representation in all occupational categories and levels in the workforce.    The Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act aims to establish a legislative framework for the promotion of Black economic empowerment, empower the Minister to issue codes of good practice and to publish transformation charters, establish the Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council and provide for matters connected therewith.  The Department of Trade and Industry (2003:12) defines BBBEE as an ‘integrated and coherent socio-economic process that directly contributes to the economic transformation of South Africa and brings about significant increases in the numbers of black people that manage, own and control the country’s economy, as well as significant decreases in income inequalities’.  The Act is driven by a scorecard in organisations and includes but is not limited to elements of human resource development, employment equity, enterprise development, preferential procurement, as well as investment, ownership and control of enterprises and economic assets.  It is in place to increase the shareholding of Black, Coloured and Indian South Africans who were excluded from having meaningful ownership of the economy during Apartheid (Department of Trade and Industry, South Africa, 2003).   University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    4 The history of South Africa makes the diversity and inclusion context somewhat different from the European and American literature that has influenced this research.  The racial group terms that are used in this research reflect those used in South African society, and are Black, White, Coloured and Indian.  Blacks make up the majority of the economically-active population (75%), followed by Whites (12%), Coloureds, Indians and Chinese (13% collectively)4. Prime (1999) states that Black South Africans are divided into nine major different ethnic groups with different communities, cultural practices and languages: the Zulu (majority), Xhosa, South Sotho, North Sotho, Tswana, Venda, Ndebele, Swazi and Tsonga.  Amongst White South Africans are Afrikaners, who are descendants of the original settlers, the Dutch Calvinist Boers (farmers), people of British origin, and people of European origin (Italians, Portuguese, Germans and French).  Owing to inequalities perpetuated during Apartheid in a society where 75% of the population is Black, Black culture remains a minority culture in South African corporate environments (Paramasur and Zulu, 2009).  This is consistent with the aims of the Apartheid, which related to ‘the formalization and expansion of existing policies and practices into a system of institutionalised racism and White domination’ (Anonymous, 2007a:2).    The practical manifestation of diversity practice depends to a large extent on the intention of the top management leading organisations in South Africa and abroad (Booysen, 2007a; Human, 2005).  Cox (1991) differentiates the monolithic organisation from other organisations by describing it as one which is homogenous, and where discrimination and prejudice are prevalent.  In South Africa, monolithic organisations demonstrate a lack of commitment to transformation by budgeting for non-compliance financial penalties associated with the Employment Equity legislation (Republic of South Africa,1998a).  In pluralistic environments where there is some commitment from the organisation to transformation (Cox, 1991), organisational processes are customised to meet the requirements of the Employment Equity (Republic of South Africa, 1998a) and  Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Acts (Republic of South Africa, 2003).  In a multicultural environment, organisations ‘actively include diversity of groups, styles and perspectives and systemic changes are made to value and include all kinds of people’ (Holvino, 19985 in Holvino et al., 2004:247).  Hornsey and Hogg (2000) suggest that multiculturalism, or cultural pluralism, differs philosophically from assimilation in that it assumes that ethnic                                                4 Statistics from the Commission for Employment Equity (2007-2008). 5 Holvino, E (1998). The multicultural organization development model. Unpublished training materials. Brattleboro, VT:Chaos Management. University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    5 identities are cognitively inescapable and fundamental to the self concept and as a result, individuals are motivated to retain their cultural heritages.  Rather than trying to eclipse ethnic identities, multiculturalism aims to preserve their integrity while encouraging ethnic groups to interact and coexist harmoniously.   Most corporate organisations in South Africa operate largely within a pluralistic framework and are struggling to take the steps towards a multicultural environment.  This view is supported by Van der Wal and Ramotsehoa (2001), Booysen, Nkomo and Beatty (2002), Ocholla (2002) and Thomas (2004), who assert that while diversity management is practised in some organisations, many South African organisations have assimilated cultures.  Thomas and Gabarro (1999) suggest that this approach limits the organisation from developing a diverse, inclusive culture.  To drive inclusion of individuals in the organisation, diversity needs to be taken one step further, and employees need to be given the opportunity to remain themselves at work, without having to assimilate to a dominant culture.  To drive inherent, systemic change, organisations are required to go beyond the transformation of numbers and create a culture of inclusion (Allen & Montgomery, 2001).  This is supported by Thomas and Jain (2004:49) who indicate that ‘while numerical target setting is important…the practices of training and development, mentoring and coaching, and competence transfer for those recruited into companies are equally important’.    Human (1996b) suggests that research and practical experience were gained during the time of the Apartheid regime, which inform the implementation of affirmative action and managing diversity programmes in a new era.  While this is true, pressures that organisations are facing today are compounded by increased competitiveness, a substantially increasing rate of complexity, and high labour turnover, which challenges our organisations’ rate of learning (Obeng, 2008).  Horwitz, Bowmaker-Falconer and Searll (1996:148) state that ‘SA organisations appear to be responding to global competition, new technology and productivity pressures in similar ways to those abroad.  Organisational restructuring, downsizing and delaying are common responses’.  The consistently changing nature of our environment and organisations, makes applying lessons from the Apartheid era challenging.  It does, however, make the need for diversity more pressing.  Grant (2007:93) suggests that ‘accelerated corporate interest in this field may be linked to government pressure, globalisation, and the much vaunted “global economy”, in which public and private sector industries compete for business in a global market’.  Human (1996b:46) asserts that ‘South Africa, unlike some other countries of the world, has no choice but to manage workforce University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    6 diversity and to manage it effectively; the future prosperity and stability of the country, and possibly the region, depend on it’.   1.2 PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF THIS STUDY Two branches of humanistic thought have emerged at the turn of the twenty-first century.  The first is theistic humanism which concerns finding ‘deeper roots of human worth and dignity in God or some divine transcendence’ (Mele, 2009:125).  The second genre is  secular humanism and informs the philosophical foundation of this research.  ‘Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without supernaturalism, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfilment that aspire to the greater good of humanity’ (Humanistic Manifesto III6, 2003:11).  Mele (2009:126) adds that secular humanism is ‘centred on human interests or values, and stresses an individual’s dignity and worth and capacity for self-realization through reason'.    The philosophy of humanism originated in the ‘late medieval and early modern times’ (Nida-Rümelin, 2009:15).  The philosophy developed as a liberal response to dominant sources of power such as a king or priest, and citizens ‘boldly proclaimed individual freedoms as the central tenet of organized society’ (Pirson, Von Kimakowitz, Spitzeck, Amann & Khan, 2009:1).  In the 20th and 21st centuries thoughts relating to humanism have continued to develop and the concept of post-humanism has emerged.  Post-humanism relates to anti- humanistic thought and finds that ‘individuals are no more than effects of the structure and a subject is a mere holder of production relationships’ (Mele, 2009:123).    The philosophy of diversity and inclusion in the workplace aligns closely to the philosophy of secular humanism.  The Humanistic Manifesto III (2003) supports a global commitment to diversity7 and advocates that people should be treated with dignity.  Further, in an organisational context, secular humanism underlies ‘respect for the individual and the idea that every person is different and should be treated in accordance with his or her qualities and personality’ (Mele, 2009:131).  Since the philosophy of inclusion relates to creating an organisation culture where individuals are respected and their contributions valued, it is clear                                                6 Released by the American Humanistic Association 7 ‘Humanists are concerned for the well being of all, are committed to diversity, and respect those of differing yet  humane views’ (Humanistic Manifesto III, 2003:11).  University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    7 that the philosophies are aligned.  Aktouf and Holford (2009:101) advocate that ‘adopting a humanistic approach within business activities and interactions is of the utmost priority if society and, by extension, we as human beings both in the individual and collective sense are to survive, flourish, and emancipate ourselves’.    1.3 RESEARCH PURPOSE AND QUESTIONS  The purpose of this study is to aid South African organisations in moving towards a diverse and inclusive environment. This is done through exploring three research questions using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies.  The questions are:  Question 1: What are the effects of diversity characteristics on diversity and inclusion? Question 2: Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces? Question 3: What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa?  Question 1: What are the effects of diversity characteristics on diversity and inclusion? Problem statement: Organisations make assumptions about which groups perceive inclusion more or less positively, which could deter their diversity efforts.   Argyriades (2001:4) suggests that public discussions about diversity or differences between groups have been relatively muted throughout the world because ‘matters of difference are considered a purely private matter’.  The challenge of this position is that to increase the ability of an organisation to solve problems, ‘it needs to bring together the different viewpoints, often contrasting values and competencies’ of individuals from different groups (Argyriades, 2001:7).   Several researchers (Greenhaus, Parasuraman & Wormley, 1995; Mor Barak & Levin, 2002; Findler, Wind & Mor Barak, 2001; Mor Barak, Nissley & Levin, 2001; Mor Barak, 2000; Pelled, Ledford & Morman, 1999) have tested the relationship between various diversity characteristics and perceptions of inclusion.  Mor Barak and Levin (2002) suggest that there is further need for investigation of diversity characteristics such as religion, age, physical ability and accent.  A further reason for testing these hypotheses comes from Miller (1998: University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    8 157), who suggests that organisations need to ‘find new ways to maximise each person’s ability to contribute and add value’.  Understanding whether groups of people perceive inclusion or exclusion is critical to understanding where the issues lie and ensures that interventions are focused on the correct issues.  This question contributes to practice through exploring whether group characteristics such as age, race or gender affect the perception of inclusion of that group. Understanding whether perceptions of diversity and inclusion can be attributed to a specific group characteristic allows managers and researchers to understand which groups perceive inclusion less positively. This understanding enables practitioners and the research community to develop and implement measures to shift perceptions of exclusion in favour of inclusive environments that contribute to potential high performance.    Question 2: Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces?   Problem statement: The relationship between individual perception of inclusion and individual performance is unclear based on current research.   The context for this question is introduced by Thomas, R.R. (2002); Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a, 2000b) who argue that subjective, nonfactual arguments supporting diversity should be replaced with proof that diversity management adds value to an organisation.  This can be done through establishing a business case for diversity management which ‘links investments in organisational diversity initiatives to improvements in productivity and profitability’ (Litvin, 2006:75).  Addressing a South African context, Horwitz et al. (2002) and Zulu and Paramasur (2009) suggest that organisations are not showing a commitment to transformation; they are demonstrating compliance with legislation.  While profit-orientated organisations are able to justify non-commitment to moral or even legislative concerns, ignoring efficiency and effectiveness measures which affect profitability of the organisation is less likely to be tolerated by shareholders.  It therefore stands to reason that organisational commitment to a transformation agenda will be amplified if the relationship between individual performance and perception of inclusion is established.   University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    9 This research question explores the business case for diversity and inclusion in the workplace through testing the relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance.  The research contributes to business practice through providing clarity and a bias for action through distinguishing whether driving diversity and inclusion is a business priority with bottom line influences or whether it is an important national concern in the hearts and minds of South Africans with some indirect effects on organisational productivity.  Pringle (2009) asserts that an approach which considers the business, legal and moral case is likely to be the most beneficial to organisations.    Question 3: What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa?  Problem statement: Elements that relate to managing the perception of inclusion in the workplace are unclear.  Pringle et al. (2006) and Pringle (2009) observe that there is an atheoretical understanding of workplace diversity which fails to provide explanations and frameworks which consider national locale, organisations and individuals.  This is supported by Prasad and Mills (1997) who question the lack of serious research in this area and the implementation of diversity management.  Steyn8 (2007) cited by Grant (2007:95) asserts that ‘corporate resistance has ensured that many interventions, even very good ones, are also regulated in a certain manner.  Often, practitioners will work, and when they leave, the waters just close behind them and the companies carry on as normal’.  Further, the Commission for Employment Equity Report (2006/2007:36) highlights that transformation in South Africa is slow.  This suggests that interventions that are in place are not directly effective in driving change in the organisations.  This could be caused by inadequate leadership of diversity and inclusion in organisations, or could be the result of diversity practitioners not addressing diversity and inclusion from a systems perspective in the organisations.  Horwitz et al. (2002:1115) suggest that ‘although progress has been made to enhance racial and gender diversity in the workplace, this is an incremental process which has to be supported by coherent human resource development priorities and changes in the organizational culture’.                                                8 Grant, T. (2007). Transformation challenges in the South African workplace: A conversation with Melissa Steyn of Incudisa. Business Communication Quarterly, 70(1), 93-98.  University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    10 Numerous researchers have suggested that a diversity and inclusion culture needs to be established and managed at organisational, interpersonal and individual levels (Cox, 2003; Louw, 1995; Schultz et al., 2008), but there is little comprehensive research to suggest which factors need to be managed.  This question seeks to understand the components which influence individual perception of inclusion in South African organisations.  These insights can be used to help organisations understand the strengths and weaknesses of their diversity and inclusion practices, but can also be used to understand areas which need to be developed to create a culture where individuals feel respected and valued for their unique contributions.   1.4 DELIMITATION The research organisation is a global multinational with an established division in South Africa.  In 2008, it featured as a Fortune 500 company.  The company is a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company renowned for world-class practices and processes in South Africa and abroad.  The operation produces and distributes 15 brands in South Africa and 51 brands across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America.  It has been operating in South Africa since the late 1800s and began global expansion after registering on the London Stock Exchange in 1999.  At the end of its financial year in March 2009, the group’s revenue was US$25,302 million.  South Africa’s contribution to the earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) was 21%, following the contributions of Europe and Latin America, which contributed 22% and 28% respectively.  Africa and Asia and North America followed with contributions of 15% and 14% respectively.  Revenue and total volume followed the same pattern, with Europe, Latin America and South African being the largest contributors.   The operation in South Africa has seven production plants and is divided into five sales and distribution geographical regions.  This research was undertaken in one of the sales and distribution regions: the division in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, located at the southern most section of South Africa, which has a turnover in excess of R4,5 billion per year.    University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    11 1.5 ASSUMPTIONS The researcher makes the assumption that after almost a century of oppression and racial conflict, the country is ready to move beyond an assimilation approach and address the stereotypes and other barriers that South African organisations face to a diverse and inclusive environment.  Further, South Africa emerges from a history of patriarchy (Republic of South Africa, 2000) which influences society through the ideologies and constructs that are passed down through generations and are unfortunately rarely challenged by younger generations.  This influences the way individuals in a society respond to change and is possibly why diversity management has made limited strides in South African society.  This research assumes that South African leaders are ready to challenge the status quo and collectively make strides towards a multicultural environment.  If South Africans leaders are not ready to challenge the status quo, it is unlikely that they will drive a diverse and inclusive work environment (Booysen, 1999), and the relevance and importance of this research would be undermined.     A second assumption is that diversity and inclusion will benefit the moral, social and economic fabric of organisations and is therefore a worthwhile organisation challenge.  The research on the benefits and costs of diversity show mixed results so there is not conclusive evidence that creating inclusive environments in organisations will influence business success.  If diversity and inclusion do not positively influence the organisation, the relevance and value of this research would be undermined.   1.6 DEFINITIONS Comparative definitions for key concepts are discussed in detail in chapter two. However, working definitions for key concepts are outlined below:  Gardenswartz and Rowe (1998:20) suggest that ‘Affirmative Action relates to achieving equality of opportunity in the work environment through the change of organizational demographics’.  In South Africa, Employment Equity legislation (Republic of South Africa, 1998a) was enacted in 1998 to redress demographic imbalances in the workplace driven by Apartheid.  Thomas, A. (2002:237) proposes that Employment Equity aims to promote ‘equal opportunity and fair treatment through the elimination of unfair discrimination and University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    12 through the implementation of affirmative action measures to advance black people, women and people with disabilities’.   Prasad, Pringle and Konrad (2006) propose that valuing diversity concerns broad organisational change aimed at improving conditions for minorities and women; it should be morally and ethically driven and concerns mutual respect, collaborative work styles and employee empowerment.  Kendall (1995:79) adds that valuing diversity involves creating a work environment in which people are appreciated for who they are as members of their race, their gender, their age, their physical ability status, their culture - their differences as well as their similarities.   Thomas (2006:101) defines diversity ‘as a mix of differences, similarities, and tensions that can exist among the elements of a collective mixture’ and suggests that to determine whether the group is truly diverse, the organisation should understand which dimensions they consider significant and review how diverse or similar the group are against those criteria.  Further, Milliken and Martins (1996) and Pelled, Eisenhart and Xin (1998) separate diversity into visible (surface-level) and non-visible (deep-level) characteristics and suggest different management plans on that basis.  April (2009a) supports this view and states that diversity is all the ways in which individuals differ, some are visible and some are not visible.  It includes, but is not limited to age, gender, race, nationality, physical ability, religion, language, value systems, heritage, funct on, education, thought processes, life experiences, sexual orientation, family status, talents, beliefs, skills and perspectives.    De Wit and Greer (2008) suggest that team member diversity can be defined as the distribution of differences among team members or any characteristic people might use to describe how they and other people are different.   Louw (1995) suggests that a broad definition of diversity includes issues of race, gender, age, physical ability, sexual orientation, religion and so forth, in addition to broader issues such as experience, position in the family, personality, job function, rank and so forth.  Louw (1995) highlights that a benefit of this definition ‘is that it is all-inclusive, and each person is recognised as part of diversity that needs to be valued’.  Giovannini (2004:22) suggests that ‘inclusion is a state of being valued, respected, and supported.  It is based on an organizational culture, management practices, and interpersonal University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    13 relationships that support the full utilization of a diverse work force at all levels and in all functions of an organization’.  Inclusion is a deeper, cultural commitment to valuing the unique contribution of every individual, regardless of background, colour, gender or age (Performance through Inclusion Consulting, undated).  Moghaddam and Solliday (1991) assert that assimilation could be conceptualised in two ways.  The melting pot assimilation is assumed to operate in a spontaneous way and involves the belief that through shared endeavours and intensive social interaction, old ethnic loyalties melt away and reform into a new, homogeneous society.  The second view on minority group assimilation involves non-dominant subgroups adopting the language, values and systems of a dominant group or subgroup.    1.7 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY This research contributes to the field of diversity management through providing diversity providers and organisation leaders with a comprehensive model of diversity and inclusion components which should be considered at individual, interpersonal and organisational levels.  While the difference between diversity and inclusion is understood by diversity leaders, research on the elements which need to be managed to enhance individual perception of inclusion is limited.   Further, this research investigates whether individual perception of inclusion affects individual performance.  A significant relationship between inclusion and performance would support the business argument for driving an inclusive environment, and would suggest that investing in individual inclusion will likely be rewarded with high performance.  A non-significant relationship between perception of inclusion and performance would suggest that in order to drive transformation in South Africa, there needs to be a heavier reliance on the legal and moral imperatives to transform South African organisations.   A component of this study explores the relationship between demographic characteristics and individual perception of inclusion.  This exploration is important because it provides academics and practitioners with an indication of which groups perceive inclusion less positively in South Africa.  This understanding could facilitate a more focused approach to the management of diversity and inclusion in South African organisations.  University of Cape TownChapter 1: Introduction    14 1.8 SUMMARY OF THIS CHAPTER This chapter outlines the imperative for moving from diversity management to a multicultural inclusive organisation.  It provides the context for this research by outlining the background, research questions and outlines the delimitation, assumptions, definitions and significance of the study.    1.9 A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTERS TO FOLLOW Chapter two considers literature relevant to this research.  It contextualises the role of South Africa’s history in the challenges that organisations face, and drivers for a diverse and inclusive environment, in addition to reviewing relevant literature.  Chapter three outlines the methodology used to answer the research questions.  Chapter four outlines the findings of the study, and Chapter five re-examines key findings and limitations and makes suggestions for future research.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     15  CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW   In 1964, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of North America was the first piece of legislation prohibiting discrimination against what were deemed ‘protected classes’.  This legislation stated that ‘employers cannot discriminate against or segregate workers on the basis of their sex, national origin, religion, color, or race’ (Hays-Thomas, 2004:18).  While this initiated the global dialogue in support of diversity management, South Africans were not able to participate in this dialogue meaningfully until the fall of Apartheid in 1994.  Despite legislation having been instated to address past inequalities, the demographic divide which started as early as 1856 with the Masters and Servants Act is immersed into the fabric of South African society (19949).    While Kleiner (2004), speaking within a United States (US) context, claims that diversity is not progressing as effectively as it could, the US is significantly ahead of South Africa (SA) in this respect.  In SA, the need for change outweighs that of both European and American contexts.  A comparative glance at the national population, as of the last census in South Africa in 2001, and the economically active population, taken from a labour force survey in 2007, indicates that most population groups match or exceed the economically active actual population (Commission for Employment Equity, 2010).  The two groups showing exception to this are Blacks and females, who are under-represented in the economically active group.  In South Africa, 75% of the economically active population are Black, 12% are White, with the remaining 13% being Coloured10 or Indian according to the statistics provided by the Commission for Employment Equity in South Africa (see Table 2.1 below).  Men make up 54% of the population, and women 46%.  Foreign nationals make up 0.7% of the working population (Commission for Employment Equity, 2007-2008).  According to the Commission for Employment Equity (2007-2008) despite the overwhelming majority of                                                9  Stubbs, A. (Ed.). (1994). I write what I like: Steve Biko, a selection of his writings. Johannesburg: Picador Africa 10 ‘According to the Population Registration Act No 30 of 1950, “A Coloured is a person who is not a White person or a Bantu.”  ‘Coloured’ denotes a mixed race group in South Africa, which would include two or more roots involving Indigene Africans, slaves from Africa, India, Indonesia or Malaysia and White colonists.  The sub-groups of Coloured were Cape Coloured, Cape Malay, Griqua, Nama and Other Coloured (Boddy-Evans, 2009). University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     16 Blacks, Whites constitute 68% of top management, with Blacks showing 19% representation, and Coloureds and Indians about 10%.  Foreign nationals constitute about 3%.

Females compose 22% of top and senior management, with 13% of this group being White (Commission for Employment Equity, 1997-1998).  As the economically active White female population is 5.7% and they make up about 15% of top, senior and middle management, their inclusion as a designated group in the act is currently being questioned (Commission for Employment Equity, 1996-1997).  This questioning follows the Employment Equity Bill (1997) which claims that ‘it is 5000 times more likely for a White male in South Africa to be in a top management position than a Black female (Booysen, 1999).  Further, the Employment Equity Report (2010) shows that in comparison to White females, who constitute the majority of women in top management, senior management and professionally qualified posts, Black women constitute the majority of females in skilled posts.  This suggests that not only are Black females under-represented at more senior levels of South African organisations, their representation is limited to lower grade groups within organisations.  While academics in the United States (US)11 and the United Kingdom (UK)12 are required to justify the importance of                                                11 The US population according to the US Census bureau in 2004 is racially composed of 66% Whites, 13% Blacks, 5% Asians, 14% Hispanics and 2% Indigenous which include Indians/Native Americans, Alaskans and native Hawaiians (Anonymous, 2005a) 12 The populations of the UK according to the 2001 census: 91.3% are White, 4.4% South Asian, 2.2% Black, 1.4% Mixed Race, 0.4% Chinese and 0.4% other (Anonymous, 2003).   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     17 heterogeneous workplaces based on predicted future workforce representation (regression), in South Africa, the context for the discussion is self-evident.  Stuber (2007a) outlines the US and European organisational contexts in terms of diversity management and addresses the future of diversity management in those environments,  which, in addition to building internal capacity, is about building tools for international expansion or the inclusion of existing foreign departments.

In South Africa (SA), language University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     18 is a diversity concern, with 11 official languages13, and many more unofficial languages.  Although English is the most common medium in organisations, the 2001 Census suggests it is the mother tongue of only 8% of the population (Statistics South Africa, 2004).  Webb (2002) suggests that while 50% of South Africans have some knowledge of English and about 40% have some knowledge of Afrikaans, use is limited to social interactions and is not effective for use in education or work.  A frequent barrier to employment, therefore, is that employees are required to speak English with relative fluency in order to move into South African corporations, especially into higher levels of the organisation (Webb, 2002).  Accent is a further barrier which many employees face in making themselves understood.  This provides some challenges with communication, and adds complexity to diversity management.    Hays-Thomas (2004) adds disability and sexual harassment to Stuber’s (2002) suggestion that legislation in the US focuses on race, gender and age.  In the European Union (EU) discrimination legislation covers employment equality, age, gender, disability, religion, sexual orientation, equal pay and rehabilitation of offenders (Slaski & Schultz, 2005).  Related SA legislation will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, but it includes the Labour Relations Act (Republic of SA, 1995), the Employment Equity Act (Republic of SA, 2008a) , the Skills Development Act (Republic of SA,1998b), the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act (Republic of SA, 2000), and the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (Republic of SA, 2003).  The pieces of legislation most relevant to this research are the Employment Equity Act (Republic of SA, 1998a) and the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Act (Republic of SA, 2003) which are concerned with increasing Black ownership of the economy in South Africa.  Similar to the EU context, resources are mostly allocated in an ad hoc fashion in South Africa, with most processes around diversity, other than legislation driven processes, being unstructured.  Booysen (2007b:140) suggests that this has resulted in a ‘disconnect, or not sufficient alignment between formal policies and the implementation of the policies which impacts on the formal and informal culture of the organisation’.  While in the US and EU contexts there are dedicated divisions or teams allocated to working with diversity issues (Stuber, 2002), in South Africa diversity management falls mostly under the portfolio of Human Resources, and is not considered or treated as a strategic priority (Thomas, 2004).  This lack of focus                                                13 Afrikaans (spoken by 13.3% of the population), English (spoken by 8.2%), IsiNdebele (spoken by 1.6%), IsiXhosa (spoken by 17.6%), IsiZulu (spoken by 23.8%), Sepedi (spoken by 11.9%), Sesotho (spoken by 7.9%), Setswana (spoken by 8.2%), Siswati (spoken by 2.7%), TshiVenda (spoken by 2.3%), XiTsonga (spoken by 4.4%), Other (0.5%) (Statistics South Africa, 2010). University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     19 combined with a lack of understanding of how the change is enabled, is key to why diversity and progress around diversity issues are challenged in South Africa (Booysen, 2007a).  It is also influenced by organisations not fully understanding that inherent in diversity management is the existence of an inclusive environment for people to work in.  While the drivers for change in the US and EU are largely based on moral imperatives, business underpinnings or socially-driven pressures, in South Africa it is largely driven by legislation (Booysen, 2007a).  Given the urgency in South Africa towards demographic change in the workplace, it is surprising how few committed efforts to managing diversity and affirmative action have been made (Human, 1993; 1996b).    2.1 BARRIERS TO CHANGE It was mentioned in chapter one, that diversity management in South African organisations is failing to achieve the transformation objectives of South Africa, which is for workplaces to be demographically representative, and for workplaces to become inclusive environments in which all people wish to offer their discretionary effort to their workplaces (April & April, 2009).  This might be caused by the misguided focus of diversity management in South Africa, which largely concerns pursing equity targets and sometimes extends to diversity training or diversity awareness programs.  Booysen (2007b) explains that while organisations have put the structures for good employee relations in place, the change was driven by legislation, not necessarily by internal drivers which could explain why the policies have not been internalised.  This focus, Thomas and Gabarro (1999) suggest, leads to assimilation of minority groups into existing corporate culture rather than developing an inclusive culture that integrates diversity.  This means that diverse, competent individuals are recruited into the organisation and depending on how well they ‘naturally’ align to the organisational culture, they are required to compromise individual characteristics contrary to the organisational culture and adapt to the culture of the organisation.  This ranges from external factors like dress code, to more subtle phenomena like not speaking out with contrary, non-conforming views.  It ultimately means that different ideas, opinions and insights are lost in favour of ‘fitting-in’.  Thomas and Ely (1996:89) outline a consequence of this: ‘because individuals will continue to think that they must hide parts of themselves in order to fit in, they will find it difficult to engage fully not only in their work, but also in their workplace relationships’.  An assimilation approach ignores individual and cultural differences which are surrendered in favour of the dominant culture of the organisation (Pless & Maak, 2004; University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     20 Prasad, Pringle & Konrad, 2006).  Prasad et al. (2006) suggest that assimilation requires considerable sacrifice and does not support valuing of individual and cultural differences.  Thomas, R. R. (2002:2) proposes that ‘this leaves companies with the challenge of managing unassimilated diversity and receiving the same commitment, quality and profit they once got from a homogenous work force’.  This is supported by research conducted by Hornsey and Hogg (2000), who add that assimilation may create identity threats and a non-harmonious group atmosphere.   A further problem with assimilation in South Africa, is that a minority group culture dominates the culture of South African organisations, particularly at management and leadership levels (Commission for Employment Equity, 2007-2008; Booysen, 2007b).  As Whites hold the majority of senior and top management positions and Blacks, Coloureds and Indians collectively make up the majority of our population (Commission for Employment Equity, 2007-2008), it follows that Black, Coloured and Indian employees are holding the majority of shop floor and functional level jobs (Booysen, 1999).  This suggests that the bulk of the workforce is assimilating to a dominant White minority culture, which is a challenge for organisations to manage (April & April, 2009).  This compromises the ability of the organisation to move forward in terms of diversity management.  As Thomas and Ely (1996) indicated above, assimilation challenges engagement, which, considering the scale, could compromise the transformation objectives of the organisation.    The second problem is that of White supremacy and self-confidence (Seegers, 1993; Matemba, 2008).  Booysen (2007b) calls for a mind shift which requires South Africans to truly accept that they are all equal.  This involves recognising that all South Africans have value to add.  Booysen (2007b) adds that South Africans should be more thoughtful and responsive, and suggests that management should replace forceful and directive behaviour with an exploration of the richness of South African cultures.  Van der Westhuizen (2007) claims that South African identity was forged during the Apartheid era, and youngsters find themselves infected by the same discourse around the fear of losing White privilege and power.  Van der Westhuizen (2007) asserts that South Africans need to confront what White power means in Africa, and in South Africa in a post-Apartheid, post-colonial context.  As all race groups battle to find their new identity in the post-Apartheid era, many White people struggle with treating previously disadvantaged individuals as equals (Booysen, 2007b).  Similarly, many Black people who experienced suppression during Apartheid struggle to portray confidence as a result of actions driven by Apartheid legislation and practices.  Maier University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     21 (2002:3) says that ‘centuries of exploitation, humiliation and conditioning have left their marks on all population groups in various ways’.  Human (1994) claims that these power relations have had a dampening effect on both the motivation and the performance of many Black people.  Tsukudu (1996) proposes that without the commitment of White males in South Africa to drive affirmative action in South Africa, they will maintain their privileged position by closing off opportunities to White women and Blacks or will continue to appoint Black managers to token positions which have no real decision-making power (Zulu & Paramasur, 1999).  The third challenge relates to minority representation and development.  Context for the third challenge, relating to workplace numbers, is introduced by Dobbin and Kalev (2007) who confirm in their research that organisations that add minorities in top positions see faster growth of Blacks in lower level management, and organisations that add women at the top of the organisational hierarchy see faster growth of White and Black women in management.  This is supported by the findings of the Businesswomen’s Association (BWA, 2009) of South Africa, who indicate that since the 2004 census there has been a positive increase in the number of women in leadership positions.  They also indicate that directorships increased from 7.1% in 2004 to 14.6% in 2009.  A comparison of 2008 and 2009 survey data of the BWA (2009:7) South African Women in Leadership census shows that ‘results remained fairly stagnant, that directorships showed little change and remained stable at 14.6%, executive manager positions dropped from 25.3% in 2008 to 18.6% in 2009, executive CEOs/MDs remained constant at 3.6% and women chairs at board level increased from 3.9% in 2008 to 5.8% in 2009’.  It is encouraging that gender representation at board level is increasing and that the ‘entrenched patriarchal minefield’ (April & Dreyer, 2007:62) is being penetrated.  While it is encouraging that there is some progress in developing minority groups, the growth is ‘painfully slow’ according to the Commission for Employment Equity (2006-2007:36).  Research suggests that while there has been a significant paradigm shift in the representation of women in the public sector, they are under-represented in corporate environments (April & Dreyer, 2007).  A reason for this might be highlighted in research by Ohlott, Rudderman and McCauley (1994) who show that men experienced more task-related challenges than women who experienced more challenges from obstacles in their jobs than men.  Furthermore, research by Stroh, Brett and Reilly (1996) finds that women have higher turnover than men and leave for reasons such as lack of career opportunities, job dissatisfaction and disloyalty to the organisation.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     22 Compounding this issue is that organisations blame their lack of diverse representation on lack of skills, knowledge and competency available in the South African marketplace.  In order to show commitment to building skills, many organisations place Black individuals in trainee positions or in support functions.  This finding is supported by the Commission for Employment Equity (2006-2007:37) who claim that ‘those Blacks who receive training appear to be on perpetual training with no graduation into meaningful career paths’, and that the training itself is ‘not purposeful’.  While the Commission for Employment Equity confirms that White individuals dominate the middle to upper levels when it comes to receiving training, Booysen (1999) claims that patriarchy has resulted in an under-representation and less training of women in management.     The fourth issue relates to retention.  While many companies are driving recruitment of diverse individuals, they are struggling to retain equity (Black, Coloured and Indian) individuals (Booysen, 2007a).  This might be caused by individuals from diverse cultural and ethnic groups, as well as women and older adults, being excluded from networks of information and opportunity (Cox, 1993; Ibarra, 1993; Mor-Barak & Cherin, 1998; Pettigrew & Martin, 1984).  Kleiner (2004) claims that women and people of colour in responsible positions in large corporations were increasingly disinterested in staying in their organisations, despite the extra efforts made to recruit and retain them.  This position was supported by April and Dreyer’s (2007) research, in which they claim that while women are progressing to senior and executive levels, they are not staying there, because the environment is not conducive.  This results in many South African women turning their backs on corporate careers because they do not believe that the sacrifice and price are worth the effort.  Booysen (2007b) outlines that the retention rates for Black recruits have fallen, and many South African organisations are losing Black people as fast as they recruit them.  Reasons for leaving were found by Booysen (2007a) to be: low commitment shown by top management to employment equity, a lack of cultural sensitivity where new recruits are expected to assimilate, a lack of cultural awareness programmes, and an organisational culture that does not value diversity.  April and Dreyer (2007) suggest that the White male-dominant organisational culture formally and informally excludes Black recruits with Black people being regarded as tokens and not being fully integrated into companies.  The recruits are not given real responsibility or decision-making authority.  Training and development for Black employees is limited, as is access to high visibility projects or positions, with Blacks remaining in ‘soft’ positions.  Growth is further hampered by restricted access to mentors, and a lack of role models.  This finding is supported by Kanyile and Maponga (2007) who University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     23 show that Black professionals are significantly more likely to be looking for another job compared with other race groups, which is a clear indication that they are unhappy with their current jobs.  Kanyile and Maponga (2007:4) state that ‘this shows that Black professionals feel they face considerable challenges and frustrations in the work environment’.  In their research, Black individuals cited racial discrimination as one of the key causes for unfair treatment and felt that whilst companies have transformation strategies in place, attitudes and systems are yet to be transformed.  The Black professionals felt that they were the only ones going the extra mile and that companies needed to reach out to them and recognise and reward their efforts.  Another issue relates to the retention of White males.  Thomas, R. R. (2002) suggests that in diversity management, race classification could be heightened and ‘reverse discrimination’ could lead to a decrease in employee loyalty and retention of skilled employees, particularly White males.  Retention issues for this group have come to the fore and are outlined by research of Kanyile and Maponga (2007:4) whose ‘quantitative research concluded that while a proportion of Black professionals have changed jobs since they started their careers (48%), White professionals were significantly more likely to have changed jobs (75%)’.  While their research does not attribute the reason for turnover as necessarily being race related, it does not discount it, which suggests that the retention rates of the latter should be monitored.  The fifth issue, competence of management, refers to both the competence of senior management to lead diversity and inclusion in the organisation, and the competence of all line managers through levels of the organisation.  Thomas and Ely (1996) assert that the desired transformation requires a fundamental change in the attitudes and behaviours of an organisation’s leadership, and Human (2005) claims that a challenge that hinders the process of creating an inclusive and developmental diversity culture is the people-management skills of managers.  Booysen (2007:80) argues that the ‘key to managing cultural diversity in the South African workplace is the promotion of management effectiveness in an inclusive organisational culture’.  To drive a diverse and inclusive environment, senior leaders and managers throughout the organisation are required to lead the process.  This point also relates to the ability of senior management to challenge the status quo of diversity management if it is compromising, or if it is limiting the full achievement of organisational potential.  April and April (2007) suggest that inclusion is everyone’s responsibility and that it needs to be led by senior management.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     24 The sixth issue is around compromised practices and processes.  In light of increased emigration from South Africa, Thomas and Jain (2002:36) suggest that the increased mobility ‘has focused attention on the strategic management of human resources in a diverse and global context as well as on the full utilization of increasingly scarce human resources in the South African context’.  Louw (1995:15) supports this insight and asserts that for ‘organizations to achieve their vision and meet the challenges of a rapidly changing technology and a global marketplace, they must realize that managing diversity plays an integral role in how effectively the organisation operates as a whole and with particular reference to their human resources’.  Human (1993) highlights that this is not the case in many organisations in South Africa, where quick fix solutions to their management of diversity challenge takes the form of workshops or interventions which are not incorporated into overall strategic and human resource processes.  A second mistake as far as processes are concerned involves compromising on recruitment criteria or on fair promotion practices in order to achieve diversity targets.  Thomas, A. (2002:240) proposes that ‘in the quest to appear acceptable in terms of race and gender, token appointments of people lacking the necessary skills have been made’.  In the process, human resource managers cause integration problems where Black employees are not seen or treated as equals in the organisation (Booysen, 2007b).  To get this process right, human resource managers should ensure that human resource departments have powerful succession planning processes, sound performance management that extends to clear development process paths, a strong engagement strategy and a compelling employee value proposition.  Further, Konrad and Linnehan (1995) suggest that HR systems need to use identity-conscious structures to avoid manager and team discrimination against surface level diversity such as race and gender in formative processes such as recruitment and induction.  They further suggest that deep-level diversity should be driven from a systems perspective in order to drive longer term results such as high performance.    The seventh issue concerns stereotypes.  Horwitz, Bowmaker-Falconer and Searll (1996:140) maintain that ‘not unique to SA organisations is the problem of negative expectations which are associated with racial and gender stereotypes.  Stereotypes reinforce an “us and them” environment and can contribute towards under-performance’.  This has been shown by Human(1991) to result in an internalisation of inferiority and marginalisation.  Research by Adam and Moodley (1993) claim that many Whites believe that Blacks are inherently less capable than Whites, and that centuries of oppression have led to the ‘inferiorisation of Blacks’ whereby Blacks were seen as innately inferior and intellectually limited.  Adam and University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     25 Moodley (1993:54) found that while the ‘majority felt that business and society should accept Black people, value their work, provide equal opportunity and open up facilities to all race groups, the majority also felt that Blacks do not have the objectivity to evaluate business situations properly’.  Less than half of the same group felt that Blacks are too emotional and that challenging work is not as important to Blacks as it is to Whites.  A further concern is gender stereotypes.  Booysen (1999) comments that the patriarchal ideology in South Africa, based on the superior position of men is evident in both the government and the corporate world, and that the division of labour is based on stereotypical gender roles.  These stereotypes are severely limiting to the progress of diversity management in South Africa, and if not dealt with, will compromise processes that are put in place to drive diversity management.    2.2 INVESTIGATING THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF A DIVERSE AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT There is a range of arguments supporting the contention that diversity and inclusion are beneficial to our operating environment.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a) ask for the establishment of a business case for diversity management which shows the benefit of diversity management to organisations and employees.  They highlight that the moral and legal arguments should be considered in addition to the commercial argument.  Research supporting and disproving the arguments is discussed below.  2.2.1 Commercial case There are numerous commercial benefits for driving a diverse and inclusive environment.  The first is that the cost of staffing is likely to be reduced (April, 2009a) through lower turnover rates and low absenteeism, as well as raised levels of satisfaction with career development, and the feeling that acceptance of cultural differences saves organisations money.  Cox and Blake (1991) assert that satisfied employees stay where they are appreciated.   A second commercial argument is that resource acquisition is improved through access to untapped talent (April, 2009a; Cox, 2003; Cox & Blake, 1991; Forsythe, 2003).  The ability to attract and retain a diverse workforce brings the ‘brightest and the best’ to an organisation, and will win the competition for the best personnel (Blass & April, 2008).  This affects the University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     26 organisation’s productivity and competitiveness at all levels.  Further, because clients choose organisations with a strong employee base, they too are drawn to such organisations (Cox & Blake, 1991).  The attraction of local talent reduces the cost of relocating talent from other areas (April, 2009a).   Third, from an employee perspective, Cox (1993) asserts that organisations can expect increased job and career satisfaction, organisational identification, job involvement, job performance ratings, compensation and promotion.  Gottfredson (1992) offers an alternative perspective that embracing diversity and diversity-sensitive human resource systems might compromise employee satisfaction and productivity through the perception of merit and fairness.  Fourth, April (2009a) asserts that managing diversity and inclusion well enhances the corporate image, and Orenstein (2005) suggests that managing diversity and inclusion well demonstrates corporate goodwill to become the ‘employer of choice’.  Cox and Blake (1991) suggest that with globalisation, the marketplace demands that organisations be able to manage cultural differences inherent in doing business with other countries.   Fifth, a further commercial argument is highlighted by Allen and Montgomery (2001) who claim that a diversified staff can also help an organisation to understand how to market to an increasingly diverse customer base.  Allen and Montgomery (2001) assert that this increases the agility and adaptability of the organisation, which in turn leads to enhanced organisation credibility.  Cox and Blake (1991), and De Wit and Greer (1998), propose that the most innovative and creative teams are heterogeneous.  Further, they suggest that the insight, cultural sensitivity, viewpoints and skill base that members of diverse groups have for various markets create an opportunity for deeper and more varied market penetration, which provides ‘access to new customers’ (April, 2009a:38).  This enhanced flexibility makes organisations more responsive to changing market dynamics and enables them to move into formerly untapped markets (Cox, 2003; Cox & Blake, 1991; Lorbiecki & Jack, 2000).  In South Africa, this is a particularly appealing benefit as the Black market14, usually referred to                                                14 The Group Areas Act of 1950 (Act No. 41 of 1950) was an act of parliament created under the Apartheid government of South Africa on the 27th April 1950.  ‘This act was created to split racial groups up into different residential areas of any given town or city. The result of this act was that the best, most developed areas were reserved for the white people, while the Blacks, Indians, and Coloureds were assigned to the more rural outskirts of the major metropoles’ (South End Museum, 2010). Although this act was repealed 41 years later, on the 5th June 1991, the majority of South Africans still live within areas prescribed for their racial group by the act. The Black market or informal markets are areas like Soweto in Johannesburg, or Khayelitsha in Cape Town – areas which are mostly inhabited by Black people.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     27 as the ‘informal market,’ is largely commercially unpenetrated (Burgess, 2007).  Cox (1993) claims that exploring untapped markets will enable market share growth and enable customer intimacy.  Thomas (2004:98) states that IBM have managed to ‘expand minority markets dramatically by promoting diversity in its own workforce, which has resulted in a virtuous circle of growth and progress’.  Sixth, Allen and Montgomery (2001), Cox and Blake (1991), and Lorbiecki and Jack (2000) maintain that studies of diversity in organisations have shown that an exposure to diverse colleagues helps managers to make better decisions and cultivate new ideas by drawing on a larger pool of information and valuable experiences.  Milliken and Martins (1996) suggest that this can be negative in that many alternative solutions to problems are presented, making decisions time consuming and possibly more difficult, but this should not deter teams from engaging in the discussion.  In their counter arguments, D’Souza (1995) and Kirschenman and Neckerman (1991) suggest that people from different races will have negative interpersonal dynamics which might threaten creativity, innovation and productivity.  Further, Hacker (1995) suggests that interpersonal conflict is caused by the heterogeneity in the team and will be counter-productive for productivity.  Pelled (1996), Lau and Murnighan (1998) and Joplin and Daus (1997) provide a slightly different perspective on interpersonal conflict and suggest that a focus on surface level diversity (e.g. race and gender) can bring about emotional conflict.  Fiedler (1966) showed that while heterogeneous workgroups performed as well as homogenous groups, they experienced greater communication difficulties and found a less pleasant atmosphere than homogenous workgroups.  Jackson (1992) and Pelled, Eisenhardt and Xin (1999) suggest that while diversity is beneficial for tasks that require creative problem solving, it can interfere with performance on routine tasks.    A final commercial argument is highlighted by April (2009), Cox and Blake (1991), Orenstein (2005) and Roberson (2006) who assert that the benefits outlined above result in increased productivity, revenue or gross margin for organisations that manage diverse integration, and will result in increased competitiveness.    2.2.2 Moral Case The moral case for transformation is cited from research of Lorbiecki and Jack (2000), and the insight from numerous other academics.  Firstly, diversity and inclusion promote University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     28 interaction between ethnic groups (D’Souza, 1997), which April (2009a) suggests would enhance a sense of belonging and assist with community cohesiveness.  Laabs (1993) suggests that it helps foster culture change, and attitude adjustment (Thornburg, 1994) in the organisation, and thus counters prejudice (Smith, 1991).  Harris (1995) and Dodd-McCue and Wright (1996) suggest that it can increase attitudinal commitment, particularly amongst women, and Rossett and Bickham (1994) assert that it could create organisational harmony.  It could align corporate and personal values (April, 2009a), it is socially just and morally desirable (Carnevale & Stone, 1994; Rossett & Bickham, 1994).  Finally, it is the ‘right thing to do’ (Orenstein, 2005) as it fosters dignity and respect for all (April, 2009a).   2.2.3 Legal case The following points outline the potential savings a diverse and inclusive work environment could bring about from a legal perspective.  Firstly, the cost of litigation (April, 2009a; Performance Through Inclusion Consulting, 2009) is an important consideration.  In June 2010, Novartis paid $152.5 million dollars to settle a gender discrimination case where female employees disputed the fairness of the compensation system (Van Voris, 2010).  In November 1996, Texaco, an oil and gas corporation, paid a settlement fee of $176 million to African American employees who contended racism. Workers believed they were discriminated against with regard to promotions and pay increases, simply as a result of their race (Anonymous, 2009).  In the largest racial discrimination settlement in US history, Coca-Cola Co., a multinational beverage organisation, agreed to pay $192.5 million to settle allegations that it routinely discriminated against Black employees in pay, promotions and performance evaluations (Maharaj, 2009).  A second consideration is brand damage (April, 2009a).  Companies that are publicly seen not to practice diversity and inclusion are usually not viewed as companies that people from the historically disadvantaged individuals want to work for (Blass & April, 2008).  This does harm to the organisational brand image and may affect the investment disadvantaged groups are prepared to make in such organisations.  The cost of internal investigation (April, 2009a) can be high when grievances are laid against people and investigations need to be held, they generally negatively influence the morale of people concerned and those around them (Stuber, 2005a).  Aside from the productivity cost, University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     29 Maier (2002) asserts that the actual investigation usually comes with costs, like discrimination suits, union clashes, and settlement payments.  The cost of dislocation in the team (April, 2009a) is a further concern.  Dislocation is closely linked to the previous point.  Replacing people for any reason other than poor performance usually comes at a cost to the organisation.  Losing people means loss of competence, skill, knowledge and corporate memory (Gorelick, Milton & April, 2004).   The cost of non-compliance to the Employment Equity Act (Republic of SA, 1998a) is a concern with the Commission for Employment Equity fining employers that are not seen to be compliant with Act.  Many companies struggle to meet the requirements as they fight the war for talent (Blass & April, 2008) and battle to retain women (April & Dreyer, 2007) and people from historically disadvantaged groups (Booysen, 2007b) who are employed in their companies.  As noted above, diverse and inclusive work environments are appealing for historically disadvantaged groups, and environments that do not provide this offering usually struggle to retain these individuals.   Harvey (1999) and Kuczynski (1999) claim that organisations who ensure that demographic workforce changes are effectively managed will affect organisational efficiency and competitiveness.  Thomas and Ely (1996) and Harrison, Price and Bell (1998) propose that the benefits and costs of diversity are dependent on the way diversity is perceived and implemented.   2.3 UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DIVERSITY, DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT AND INCLUSION In the next section, the differences between the various meanings and interpretations of diversity, diversity management and inclusion are explored.   2.3.1 Definitions of diversity, diversity management and inclusion In the numerous studies about the field of diversity, the terms diversity, diversity management, and inclusion are used interchangeably and the intention or outcome is usually made apparent by the given definition.  For example, Prasad, Pringle and Konrad (2006:7) say that ‘managing diversity carries with it the legacy of managing: the traditional classic University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     30 notions of control, leadership, organizing and power’.  An alternative way of perceiving this definition is outlined by Miller (1998:151), who states that ‘diversity describes the make-up of a group and inclusion describes which individuals are allowed to participate and are enabled to contribute fully in the group’.    Diversity management usually refers to the management of all or given components of diversity in a workplace (Cox, 2003), including structures, processes and people.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a:77) propose that ‘diversity management is the commitment on the part of organisations to recruit, retain, reward, and promote a heterogeneous mix of productive, motivated and committed workers including people of colour, Whites, females, and the physically challenged’.  While diversity management is understood as the management of the external and visible display of difference in an organisation, ‘inclusion, is a deeper, cultural commitment to valuing the unique contribution of every individual, regardless of background, colour, gender or age’ (Performance Through Inclusion Consulting, 2009:1).    Miller and Katz (2002) and Roberson (2006) suggest that inclusion is a sense of belonging, feeling respected, valued for who you are, feeling a level of supportive energy and commitment from others so that you can do your best work.  Inclusion is a shift in the organisational culture, and is a process which engages each individual and makes him or her feel valued and essential to the success of the organisation.  Individuals feel a part of an organisation’s mission, function at full capacity and offer their discretionary effort when included (April, Katoma & Peters, 2009).  This culture shift creates higher performing organisations where motivation and morale soar.   A comparison by Schultz, Slaski, Blass and April (2008:7) highlights differences between the concepts of diversity and inclusion depicted in Figure 2.1.  Schultz et al. (2008) suggest that while diversity is legally imposed and about fixing numbers, inclusion informs strategic objectives and is internally driven.  With diversity, the focus is on visible differences between people, and with inclusion it is on both the invisible and visible differences.  The eventual outcome of diversity implementation involves a demographic profile change, while with inclusion it involves an organisational culture change.  While diversity focuses on minorities or specific groups, inclusion is about everyone. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     31            Figure 2.1: Comparing diversity and inclusion  Source: Retrieved from Schultz, Slaski, Blass and April (2008:7)  Roberson (2006:219) proposes a difference between diversity and inclusion:  ‘While definitions of diversity focused primarily on heterogeneity and the demographic composition of groups or organisations, definitions of inclusions focused on employee involvement, and the integration of diversity into organisational systems and processes’.  It is clear on the basis of this statement that both diversity and inclusion are needed to pursue the aims of a multicultural organisation.  Roberson (2006) adds that in an inclusive environment where difference and individuality is valued, not only would group conflict be reduced in the long term, individuals are more likely to be more engaged.  Inyang (2007:89) says that ‘inclusiveness is concerned with the creation of an environment that effectively accommodates the diverse workforce of an organisation….Inclusiveness acknowledges the existence of differences and similarities among the social unit or group’.   2.3.2 Approaches to managing diversity While there are many proposals for the meaning of diversity, diversity management and inclusion, equally there are many approaches to the management of these issues in the workplace.  Thomas (1996) proposes that one approach looks at all the elements of diversity such as leadership styles, physical characteristics, cognitive patterns, personality and demographic traits.  The challenge with this approach is that all forms of diversity receive equal attention even though some groups experience more disadvantage than other groups (Prasad, Pringle & Konrad, 2006).  Thomas (2006:101) provides a different lens for this definition and defines diversity ‘as a mix of differences, similarities, and tensions that can Comparing Diversity and InclusionBusiness / Enhance performance Strategic / Internally driven Visible & invisible differences Culture change EveryoneInclusion  Legal / Avoid penalty Remedial / Imposed Visible differences Demographic profilechange  Minorities / MinorityMemesDiversityDriverNature of ChangeFocusImplementationTarget PopulationUniversity of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     32 exist among the elements of a collective mixture’.  He suggests that in order to determine whether the group is truly diverse, the organisation should understand which dimensions they consider significant and review how diverse or similar the group is against those criteria.  Thomas (2006) mentions that if a group is very similar on the significant dimension(s), the group could be considered homogeneous and might not have the skill set to be optimally effective.   A second approach focuses on groups that have faced historical disadvantage (Cox, 1993; Linnehan & Konrad, 1999) and acknowledges the power differentials between individuals and groups.  While this form of diversity management receives legislative support from most countries, a concern could lie in that managing diversity appears in the context of affirmative action in the organisation (Prasad, Pringle & Konrad, 2006), which could lead to a compliance approach.  A compliance approach addresses compliance with the conditions of the legislation to avoid reprisal in the form of non-compliance penalties (Jain & Hackett, 1989; Leck, 2002).  Louw (1995) asserts that to limit the definition of diversity to issues of race and gender is to ignore the full range of diversity available maintains tensions around the differences.  However, Louw (1995) highlights that the risk of defining diversity too broadly is that discomfort around issues of race and gender are ignored.  Hayles and Russell (1997:13) offer that ‘instead of recognising and dealing with the reality of racism, an inclusion strategy accommodates the dominant group by using the rationale that ‘dealing exclusively with race and gender issues often causes disengagement on the part of those who most need to face race and gender issues’.  Another dimension of diversity management is outlined by Milliken and Martins (1996) and Pelled, Eisenhart and Xin (1999) who separated diversity into visible (surface-level) and non-visible (deep-level) characteristics and suggest different management plans on that basis.  Milliken and Martins (1996) suggest that while it is important to manage visible diversity, organisational benefits will come from an appreciation of non-visible characteristics, which can only be established with team tenure.  This definition is encompassed by April (2009a: 39), who defines diversity as the ‘all the ways we differ, some are visible and some are invisible.  It includes, but is not limited to age, gender, race, nationality, physical ability, religion, language, value systems, heritage, function, education, thought processes, life experiences, sexual orientation, family status, talents, beliefs, skills and perspectives’. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     33 2.3.3 Understanding the origins of inclusion/exclusion  Mor Barak and Cherin (1998) suggest that social-psychological theories of interpersonal, group and organisational literature offer insights into the inclusion/exclusion continuum.  Nkomo and Cox (1996:339) propose that the ‘concept of identity appears to be at the core of understanding diversity in organisations’.  Brown and Turner (1981) suggest that personal identification is how individuals define themselves in terms of personal or idiosyncratic attributes such as physical or intellectual traits, and other specific attributes of the individual.  Social identity, also termed group identity by Cox (1993:43) is a ‘personal affiliation with other people with whom one shares certain things in common’.  Stets and Burke (2000:224) established a connection between the personal and social identity and propose that ‘in social identity theory and identity theory, the self is reflexive in that it can take itself as an object and can categorize, classify, or name itself in particular ways in relation to other social categories or classifications’.  Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher and Wetherell (1987) suggest that much of social identity theory deals with intergroup relations, which involves whether people see themselves as members of the ‘in-group’ or the ‘out-group’ and the consequences of this categorisation, such as ethnocentrism or inclusion/exclusion.    Using what they called a ‘sociometer’, Leary, Schreindorfer, and Haupt (1995) use self-esteem to gauge perception of inclusion/exclusion from their environment.  They propose that readings of low self-esteem are related to social exclusion.  Cookson (1994) supports this finding in her research which shows a relationship between exclusion, self-esteem and maladaptive behaviours such as substance abuse and depression.  The relationship between self esteem and exclusion is disputed by Hogg (2001), Long and Spears (1997) and Rubin and Hewstone (1998) who suggest that the relationship between individual and group behaviour is affected by self-esteem extremity, identity strength and group threat.   The social comparison process (Festinger, 1957) postulates that individuals have the need to evaluate themselves and to assess their standing within groups.  To do this, they use their group as referent (Stets & Burke, 2000).  Mor Barak and Cherin (1998:50) propose that an individual’s perceptions of group inclusion is an important process in the individual’s desire to secure positive group affiliation, and add that these evaluations are related to how individuals assess their ‘fit’ within groups and organisations.  This statement suggests that an individual’s desire to be included in a group is related to whether the individual perceives the group to be included in the organisation.  The proposition that the group inclusion is related to individual inclusion could be questioned in light of a statement by Stets and Burke University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     34 (2000:16), who claim that ‘social identity theorists and identity theorists have discussed the person identity, but they have largely failed to examine how it might be incorporated into their theories’.  A practical implication of this statement is that individual perception of inclusion (personal identity) might not relate to the inclusion or exclusion of the group (social identity).    Silver (1994) asserts that post-modern thinkers are increasingly using the notion of citizenship and equality to encompass the recognition of diversity, the inclusion of all groups and the protection from stigma.  Mor Barak and Cherin (1998:341) conceptualised ‘inclusion/exclusion as a continuum of the degree to which individuals feel a part of critical organizational processes such as access to information, connectedness to coworkers, and ability to participate in and influence the decision-making process’.  Mor Barak (2000b:339) defines an inclusive workplace as one that ‘values and uses individual and intergroup differences within its work force, cooperates with and contributes to its surrounding community, alleviates the needs of disadvantaged groups in its wider environment and collaborates with individuals, groups, and organizations across national and cultural boundaries’.  While some organisations are led with the intention of an inclusive environment, in many organisations the diversity management is nothing more than the management of diverse representation in the organisation, i.e., focus on numbers of people from diverse groups which is driven by legislative requirements (Schultz et al., 2008).  Thomas and Ely (1996:81) state that ‘increasing demographic variation does not in itself increase organisational effectiveness.  It is how an organisation defines diversity – and what it does with the experiences of being a diverse organisation that delivers on the promise’.  Berman and Phillips (2000:329) propose that ‘social inclusion/exclusion is connected with the principles of equality and equity and the structural causes of their existence’.  They propose that social exclusion is related to marginalisation (Abrahamson, 1997) or a detachment from a moral order associated with status, hierarchy or collective of rights, duties and obligations.  Social exclusion is ultimately about relational issues such as inadequate social participation, lack of social integration and lack of power (Room, 1997).  While Labonte (2004) supports the view that exclusion is an outcome of social processes, he questions how individuals can feel included in structures which create an experience of exclusion.  He further questions whether social inclusion is in the interest of employers who gain ‘dominance, exploitation and hegemony’ through capitalising on the excluded minority who are likely to work for less money (Labonte, 2004:118).  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     35 2.4 SECTION A: TOWARDS A MODEL OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION In this next section, literature related to models of diversity and inclusion is examined.  Diversity models are examined first, followed by inclusion models.  A review of inclusion elements are looked at thereafter, and the section ends with a review of literature related to performance review literature.   2.4.1 Different approaches to managing diversity Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a) highlight two approaches to managing diversity.  One is the melting-pot scenario which proposes that people of different races and ethnicity should blend together and assimilate into a common national culture.  The other is a multicultural society which suggests that all ethnic groups should retain their cultural patterns and coexist with each other.  The literature on diversity ‘management’ is numerous and contains many valuable insights.  While each of these models have advantages and shortfalls, it is clear that the models are developed for different contexts, environments and for different purposes.  The intention of this literature review is to understand the difference in practice between managing diversity and managing inclusion as a means to answering question three of this research.  The following section is a review of key related literature.  The subsections are discussed by author.  The subsections commence with a review of the author’s guidelines, paradigm or models and are followed by a critical review of the same.   2.4.1.1 Thomas, R. R. (2002, 2006)  Thomas, R.R. (2002) and Thomas (2006) provide suggestions regarding the management and leadership of diversity in organisations.   Thomas, R. R. (2002:12) says that the challenge is that ‘companies are facing the problem of surviving in a fiercely competitive world with a work force that consists and will continue to consist of unassimilated diversity’.  He proposes ten guidelines for learning to manage diversity.  Firstly, organisations should clarify their motivation and should understand the business rationale for change, which supports the moral and legal benefits.  Secondly, the vision should be clarified, and should be one where the full potential of all employees is harnessed.  Third, different types of diversity should be included.  Organisations should think beyond race, gender, ethnicity, creed and ethnicity to age, background, education, function and personality differences.  Fourth, organisations should audit their corporate culture to University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     36 understand what it looks like, and then build a culture that accommodates unassimilated diversity.  Fifth, modify the assumptions which prevent respecting difference.  Thomas, R.R. (2002) mentions that the goal of respect is not about smoothing out individual differences.  Sixth, modify the systems to ensure fairness for all employees.  Seventh, modify organisation models such that managers create the climate for people to do what they’ve been charged to do, and are not doing the work of their subordinates.  Eighth, create structures which help people to pioneer through the diversity journey because there is no ‘solution’ to diversity management and individuals are likely to encounter many problems.  As part of the ninth step, organisations are encouraged to apply the special consideration test, which is to consider whether the program, policy or principle gives special consideration to one group, whether it contributes to everyone’s success or whether the program is designed for the intended audience.  Thomas, R. R.  (2002) proposes that when the answer is ‘yes’ to any of these questions, the managing diversity strategy should be revisited.  Finally, affirmative action should be pursued to ensure that the organisation is diverse at every level.    Thomas (2006) proposes that there are five fundamental understandings that promote effectiveness in strategic diversity management.  The first is that an understanding of the core concepts must be established.  Thomas (2006) proposes that many leaders share a conceptual confusion about what diversity management really means, which in turn translates into successful personal and organisational diversity efforts.  The second fundamental understanding is that the context is important, and is shaped by the external environment and the organisation’s vision, mission and values.  Thomas, R. R. (2002) highlights the importance of the making a compelling business case which achieves high strategic priority.  The third fundamental understanding proposes that diversity efforts must be driven by requirements, which enables leaders to focus on the essentials.  The fourth fundamental understanding is that diversity aspirations of individuals and their enterprises must be considered.  The fifth fundamental understanding is that enterprises and individuals must apply strategic diversity management universally.  Thomas (2006) suggests that an effective management strategy for diversity requires the ability to manage change such that the organisation becomes receptive to strategic diversity management’s definitions and principles.   Thomas, R. R. (2002, 2006) provides essential guidance to leaders around how to contextualise and conceptualise the operational and strategic management of diversity.  The frameworks show deep insight and provide valuable insight into diversity management.  The University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     37 five fundamental understandings are targeted at leaders of organisations and provide some philosophical challenging on the way leaders think about diversity.  The frameworks are not implementation models, but rather provide insight into considerations regarding the implementation of a diversity management process.  Further, Thomas, R. R. (2002, 2006) makes the difference between affirmative action and diversity management clear.  Limitations of these frameworks are that they don’t address the outcomes of diversity management that an organisation might see, nor do they provide a clear list of actions that need to be driven in order to drive diversity management from a systems perspective such as human resources systems or education programs.  Further, the frameworks fail to consider the organisation paradigm15 as outlined in research by Cox (1991), Holvino (1998), Thomas and Ely (1996), Dass and Parker (1999) and Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999).  By neglecting to specify relevant organisation paradigms, Thomas, R.R. (2002, 2006) implies that his operational and strategic guidelines can be applied within any organisation paradigm.    2.4.1.2 Cox (1991, 1993); Cox and Blake (1991) Cox (1991, 1993) and Cox and Blake (1991) are useful frameworks that provide different organisational resources.  The framework for managing diversity (Cox, 1991) provides insight into three organisation paradigms, which highlights the different approaches organisations use in the management of diversity.  Further, it considers which elements need to be developed in order to drive a multicultural environment.  Cox and Blake (1991) provide a structured list of tools to guide management in creating a multicultural organisation.  Cox (2003) provides a model to illustrate the impact of diversity on individual and organisational outcomes.    In 1991, Taylor Cox published an organisational framework for a managing diversity which differentiated organisation paradigms: monolithic, pluralistic and multi-cultural.  This gave practitioners the language to classify organisations and develop tailored diversity solutions specific to the needs of the organisation.   Cox (1991) describes a monolithic organisation as being characterised by low structural integration, assimilation and as being largely homogenous.  Cox (1991) suggests that the homogeneity results in low conflict due to cultural similarity, and as there is little importance                                                15 Organisation paradigm is a term introduced by Thomas and Ely (1996) to describe the various approaches organisations have to manage diversity. For the purpose of this literature review, the organisation paradigm refers to categories that theorists have developed  to differentiate organisations in their approaches to the management of diversity.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     38 placed on integration of group members, discrimination and prejudice are prevalent.  A plural organisation is characterised by a more heterogeneous environment than the monolithic environment.  The policies are more inclusive of minority groups and there is partial structural integration, which means integration of some minority groups into informal networks and a reduction in discrimination and prejudice.  Shortcomings of this approach are a failure to address the cultural aspects of integration and the presence of assimilation.  A multicultural organisation is characterised by pluralism (a process by which both minority and majority culture members adopt some norms of the other group), full structural integration, full integration of informal networks, no prejudice or discrimination, no cultural identification on the basis of cultural identity group and low levels of intergroup conflict.   Cox (1991) provides an organisational process towards a multicultural environment which is outlined in Figure 2.2 below.  Cox (1991) highlights action that needs to support model dimensions of a multicultural environment which occur largely at organisational and interpersonal levels.  The model dimensions include pluralism, structural integration, integration in informal networks, cultural bias, organisational identification and intergroup conflict.  A range of tools is identified against each dimension to guide the development of that dimension.   The paradigms outlined by Cox (1991) can be compared to paradigms highlighted by Thomas and Ely (1996), Holvino (1998) and Dass and Parker (1999).  As the first theorist to describe that organisations approach diversity management differently, it appears that the work of Thomas and Ely (1996), Holvino (1998) and Dass and Parker (1999) build on the three paradigms outlined by Cox (1991).  The comparison between the paradigms will be discussed in the respective sections. A limitation of Cox’s (1991) model is that it fails to consider the role of management in the various paradigms.  This has been done effectively by Dass and Parker (1999) who define management approaches against their defined paradigms.  While the strength of Cox’s model is that the model dimensions provide structure which can be compared across the various paradigms, the structure could limit the reporting of subtle nuances which characterise the various paradigms.   In 1991, Cox and Blake reframed this model to include a few other elements that need to be considered in a multicultural environment.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     39                    Figure 2.2: Creating the multicultural organisation Source: Replicated from Cox, (1991:41)   Cox and Blake (1991) suggest that the organisation’s culture should be one where differences are valued, where the individual is able to align to the organisation’s value system and where people from all cultures feel included.  Mindsets about diversity should be closely examined to determine opportunities for change, and the levels resistance or buy-in from the majority culture should be assessed.  Cultural differences should be promoted and accepted and organisations should be taking advantage of those differences.  Cox and Blake (1991) suggest that education programs should be extended to management and the community, like schools, on valuing differences.  HR management systems including recruitment, training and development, performance appraisals, compensation and benefits and promotions should be put into action without bias.  There should be more involvement in building the careers of women through helping women to manage the work-family conflict and a reducing prevalence of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace.  Finally, a heterogeneous environment should be built regarding race, ethnicity and nationality, which effects team cohesiveness, communication, conflict and morale.  This should be done through reducing the effects of group identity (stereotypes) on interactions, and dealing with all forms of prejudice including racism and ethnocentrism.   Model DimensionI.

Focus groupsReplicated from Cox, 1991: Creating the Multicultural Organization: Tools for Organization ChangeUniversity of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     40 While the structure of Cox and Blake’s (1991) model (Figure 2.2 above) is made easier to implement through its clear structure, the model is input driven and the outcome of a multicultural organisation is dependent on whether those inputs are successfully executed.  While an output-based model might have the disadvantage of being less simple to interpret, the benefits of being closer to the goal a multicultural environment could arguably outweigh this.  Although it is valuable that organisations are given an idea of practical tools they might use to create a multicultural organisation, this approach might be over-simplistic.  For example one of the stated model dimensions is to influence cultural bias through eliminating discrimination and prejudice.  While Cox and Blake (1991) suggest tools that might aid this process (equal opportunity seminars, focus groups, bias reduction training, research and task forces) these tools are likely to influence cultural bias, not eliminate them.  Further, while the model addresses practical concerns for transformation it fails to address strategic concerns such as vision and mission.  Although later models such as Booysen (2007a) and Human (2005) aim to develop multicultural organisations, these models use different approaches.  While Cox and Blake (1991) highlight specific tools that organisations could implement against specific model dimensions, Booysen (2007a) and Human (2005) discuss process flows.   Cox (1993) developed an interactional model of the impact of diversity on individual career outcomes and organisational effectiveness (Figure 2.3 below).

The individual level factors examine personal identity structures, prejudice, stereotyping and personality type.  The intergroup factors are cultural differences, enthnocentrism and intergroup conflict.  Organisational factors include culture and acculturation processes, structural integration, informal integration and institutional bias.  The diversity climate affects the individuals’ experience at work, which in turn affects the organisational effectiveness.  First level organisational benefits are likely to be seen first, followed by second level benefits in profit generating companies.  Cox (1993) further suggests that the presence of diversity in the formal and informal structures of the organisation is likely to impact directly on creativity, innovation, problem-solving, workgroup cohesiveness and communication.   In developing a model of the impact of diversity on individual career outcomes and organisational effectiveness (Figure 2.3 below), Cox (1993) provides an insightful and useful model outlining the benefits of a systems approach to diversity, i.e. that the diversity climate is influenced by diversity and inclusion occurring at three levels of the organisation, which in turn influences individual and organisational benefits.  Discussion of the drivers and outcomes of diversity at an individual, interpersonal and organisation levels can be compared to the models of Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (1998) who differentiate the factors influencing diversity and inclusion into these three categories.  This approach lends itself to a systemic transformation of the organisation since diversity management is considered from numerous angles.  This model can be compared to Gilbert, Ivancevich and Stead’s (1999) model of effective diversity management which clearly referenced Cox’s (1993) model in its design.  The details will be discussed later in this section.  The model fails to address leadership and management concerns and the concepts of structural and informal integration, while implied, are not clear.  Further, the model does not provide strategic guidance, nor does it address the outcomes of a culture of inclusion on an individual and organisation.  This might relate to the age of the model when dialogue about inclusive culture was less evident.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     42 2.4.1.3 Holvino (1998) Holvino (199816), cited in Holvino, Ferdman and Merrill-Sands (2004) outlines a model of multicultural organisational development.  She proposes that the organisation goes through 6 paradigms as they move from monocultural to multicultural.  The first paradigm is ‘exclusionary’, where members who are not part of the dominant group are actively excluded.  The second is ‘the passive club’, where members who are not part of the dominant group are actively or passively excluded.  Other members are included only if they ‘fit’.  The third paradigm is ‘compliance’, where employers are passively committed to including others without making major changes, and including only a few members of other groups. The fourth paradigm is ‘positive action’, where there is commitment to making a special effort to include others, especially those in designated target groups.  The differences that others bring are tolerated.  The fifth is ‘redefining’, where the organisation actively works to expand its definition of inclusion and diversity and tries to examine and change practices that may act as barriers to members of non-dominant groups and the sixth paradigm is ‘multicultural’, where the organisation actively includes a diversity of groups, styles and perspectives and continuously learns and acts to make the systemic changes required to value, and includes all kinds of people.   Holvino (1998) categorises paradigm one and two as typical of a monocultural environment, which she describes as an exclusionary organisation in which the values of one group, culture or style are dominant.  Paradigm three and four fall into a transitional phase where the organisation seeks to integrate others into systems created under dominant norms.  Paradigm five and six form part of a multicultural environment, which describes inclusive organisations in which the perspectives and styles of diverse peoples are valued and contribute to organisational goals and excellence.    Holvino’s (1998) model has the benefit of six levels which an organisation could use to define itself against the goal of a multicultural organisation.  This is encouraging when organisations are actively working towards a multicultural organisation and are able to see their movement through the different phases.  While the model shows progressive development on the range of categories Cox (1991) provided, Holvino’s model fails to provide deep insight into the nature of the various categories, which makes it more difficult for organisations to classify themselves in the model.  This omission is likely to limit the                                                16 Holvino, E. (1998). The multicultural organization development model. Unpublished training materials. Brattleboro, VT:Chaos Management. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     43 practical use of the model.  A further limitation of this model is that it is simplistic and lacks the structure or model dimensions which Cox (1991) adopted in his model.  This simplistic, unstructured approach makes it difficult for organisations to understand how to progress the organisation through the various phases.  Finally, this model does not provide strategic guidance to organisations, nor does it provide guidance on how the organisation should go about the transformation.  2.4.1.4 Thomas and Ely (1996) Thomas and Ely (1996) outline three main paradigms in which diversity and inclusion can be managed in an organisation: the integration and learning perspective, the access and legitimacy perspective and the discrimination and fairness perspective.  The discrimination and fairness paradigm generally focuses on equal opportunity, fair treatment, recruitment, and compliance with ‘Equal Employment Opportunity’ requirements.  It is said to go beyond a simple concern with numbers to include a mentoring and career development programme  for women and ‘people of colour’ and train employees to respect cultural differences.  It is useful for increasing demographic diversity in an organisation and promoting fair treatment.  The limitation of this paradigm is that it is built on the assumption that individuals are all the same, which means that difference is not appreciated, and that assimilation is required in order to be similar.     The access and legitimacy paradigm concerns matching demographics of the organisation with the demographics of critical consumer or constituent groups.  This paradigm has, therefore, led to new professional and managerial opportunities for women and ‘people of colour’.  Its advantages are that it has market based motivation and the potential for competitive advantage.  The limitations include emphasis on the role of cultural diversity without really analysing differences to see how they affect the work that is done and it can leave employees feeling exploited as they begin to sense that opportunities in other parts of the organisation are closed to them.  If the discrimination and fairness paradigm can be said to have idealised assimilation and colour and engendered blind conformism, the access and legitimacy paradigm was predicated on the acceptance and celebration of differences.    With the emerging paradigm, old and limiting assumptions about the meaning of diversity must be abandoned before its true potential can be realised as a powerful way to increase organisational effectiveness.  This paradigm is about the integration of differences and University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     44 similarities.  It promotes equal opportunity for all individuals, acknowledges cultural differences among people and recognises the value in those differences.  The difference is that the organisation is allowed to internalise the differences among employees so it learns and grows because of them.  Thomas and Ely (1996) suggest that the following preconditions are necessary for implementation: First, the leadership should understand that a diverse workforce will embody different perspectives and approaches to work, and must truly value variety of opinion and insight. Second, the leadership must recognise both the learning opportunities and the challenges that the expression of different perspectives presents for an organisation. Third, the organisational culture must create an expectation of high standards of performance from everyone. Fourth, the organisational culture must stimulate personal development. Fifth, the organisational culture must encourage openness. Sixth, the culture must make workers feel valued. Seventh, the organisation must have a well-articulated and widely understood mission and finally, the organisation must have a relatively egalitarian, non-bureaucratic structure.    Thomas and Ely (1996) highlight the following success criteria: firstly, the mental connection needs to be made in order to understand and work with the real issues; second,  open discussion about cultural differences should be legitimised in order for people to make explicit use of background cultural experience and knowledge; third, there should be active work against forms of domination and subordination that inhibit full contribution and fourth, making sure that organisational trust stays intact in order for employees to feel safe about being themselves at work.   While the discrimination and fairness paradigm and the access and legitimacy can be described as pluralistic models according to Cox’s (1991) framework, it seems the learning and effectiveness paradigm, while described as emerging, could be termed a multicultural organisation.  Like Cox (1991), Thomas and Ely (1996) provide insight into practices required to build their learning and effectiveness paradigm.  The merit of the paradigm is the role of leadership in the process, which was less apparent in Cox’s (1993) model.  While the model does not have the advantage of the structured model dimensions provided in Cox’s (1991) model, it has what Thomas and Ely (1996) call pre-conditions which are essentially guidelines for implementation.  While Thomas and Ely (1996) do not provide a detailed toolkit for implementation (Cox & Blake, 1991), they outline several success criteria in the form of outputs. A limitation of this model is that it fails to accommodate what Cox (1991) describes as a monolithic organisation. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     45 2.4.1.5 Dass and Parker (1999)  Dass and Parker outline four strategic responses that managers use when managing diversity.  They are reactive, defensive, accommodative or proactive, and are implemented in an episodic, freestanding or systemic way.  Dass and Parker build on Thomas and Ely’s (1996) model by adding a resistance perspective to the discrimination and fairness, access and legitimacy and learning and effectiveness paradigms.  They propose that a resistance perspective is used in organisations where diversity is not considered to be an issue or a threat and the organisations therefore use a reactive response to protecting the status quo.  The discrimination and fairness paradigm is used when the organisation views differences as causing problems and employ a defensive approach.  The access and legitimacy approach is used in support of the view that differences create opportunity and the company employs a more accommodative response.  Finally, the learning and effectiveness paradigm is proactive and supports the view that differences and similarities offer opportunities but bear costs.      Dass and Parker (1999) further suggest that the management approach differs in three different ways.  An episodic approach is usually dominant when there are few pressures for diversity and managers view diversity as a marginal issue.  The diversity initiatives of these managers tend to be isolated, disjointed and separate from core organisational activities.  A freestanding approach is usually employed for executives who experience moderate pressures for diversity and think of it as a significant but side-issue and are likely to formalise diversity initiatives without integrating them fully with core activities.  Finally, a systemic approach is employed by executives who experience high pressures for diversity, view diversity as a strategic issue and are most likely to adopt a systemic approach to diversity.  This approach involves linking diversity initiatives with existing systems and core activities of the organisation.   As a final component of their model, Dass and Parker (1999) combine the approaches (reactive, defensive, accommodative and proactive) and the strategic responses (episodic, freestanding and systemic).  The result is resistant organisations (reactive response) which are managed in an episodic, freestanding or systemic way, or another example might be a learning and effectiveness paradigm (proactive response) managed in an episodic, freestanding or systemic way.  They suggest that systemic responses are more strategic than episodic approaches, and that the proactive approach with a systemic response is likely to be employed when the pressure for diversity is high.   University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     46 Dass and Parker’s (1999) contribution of a resistance organisation is a realistic addition to Thomas and Ely’s (1996) paradigms.  Their insight around the various diversity approaches is valuable because it opens a new way of thinking and allows practitioners to see opportunity to grow diversity in any paradigm (reactive, defensive, accommodative and proactive) through using a systemic approach over an episodic approach.  The model is comprehensive in that it considers a management approach alongside a specific paradigm.  As such it marries models which provide frameworks for thinking (Cox, 1991; Holvino 1998; Thomas & Ely, 1996) and models which provide consider management perspective such as Thomas, R.R. (2002), Thomas (2006) and Cox and Blake (1991).  A limitation in this vein is that rather than provide deep insight into management approaches, it considers a management framework which is somewhat different to the management considerations provided by Thomas, R.R. (2002), Thomas (2006) and Cox and Blake (1991). A further limitation of the model is that its implementation is fairly academic in nature and outside of providing insight around the approach, doesn’t give guidance around how to implement an approach in a given paradigm.   2.4.1.6 Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999, 2000a, 2000b), Gilbert, Stead and Ivancevich (1999)  The following four models provide a range of insights for practitioners and researchers.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999) compare two paradigms in the aim of organisational diplomacy. Gilbert, Ivancevich and Stead (1999) present a model of diversity effectiveness.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a) discuss a range of organisation paradigms and   discuss considerations in establishing a multicultural organisation (2000b).      As a bridge for managing diversity Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999) differentiate between a pacification and unification approach.  While the pacification approach is reactive and is largely reflective of apathetic management, the unification approach is proactive and is driven by management involvement.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999) outline that in a passive environment organisations can expect to see behaviours such as tokenism, lack of innovation, work-family conflict, minimal policy change, majority animosity (from minority groups), which results in lawsuits, reduced competitiveness, minority turnover and whistle blowing.  In a proactive environment, which they see reflecting organisational diplomacy, organisations can expect to see fairness in term of salaries, organisation wide training, employee involvement community outreach, liaisons (employee - employer consultations), University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     47 voice mechanisms (where employees are given an opportunity to speak) and (diversity) surveys.  The model is useful because it compares the activities and outcomes of organisations that are passive and companies that are proactive in their approach. While this concept is useful, the model compares facets of the approaches at random, that is, the models don’t compare specific characteristics in both approaches. Similarly, the outputs are not related. While the outputs of a proactive environment are listed as internal and external diplomacy, those listed in pacifist organisation relate to specific outcomes such as reduced competitiveness, which does not directly link to a diminished sense of organisational diplomacy, which is the primary aim of the model.  While this model provides an outline of the difference between a proactive and reactive environment, it misses the range of paradigms offered by Holvino (1998), Thomas and Ely (1996) and Dass and Parker (1999).  The reactive environment can be likened to Dass and Parker’s (1999) resistance phase which is seen as reactive.  The proactive environment appears to be indicative of a more multicultural environment, but like Holvino’s (1998) model, this model is simple, and misses much of the structure and detail offered by Cox (1991).   Gilbert, Stead and Ivancevich (1999) provide a comprehensive model for effective diversity management which suggests inputs and outcomes (Figure 2.6).  The model is built on the premise that initiation and continuation is done with continuing involvement of the CEO, who outlines the moral imperative for diversity and drives it by establishing a mission statement and strategic plan.  The human resources function enables this through career planning, mentoring, recruitment, compensation, accountability through appraisals, education/awareness, family-friendly policies and diversity councils.  For the individual, this results in penetration of the glass ceiling, increased integration, increased attachment to the organisation and decreased psychological dissonance.  This in turn results in a transformation of the attitudes towards diversity, and increases acceptance, appreciation of difference and multiculturalism.  These changes result in visible organisational benefits such as better decision making, representation and retention of qualified minorities, business with a diverse and multinational customer base and product line development, which enable organisational outcomes such as increased profit, market share and stock price and public recognition for their diversity efforts.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     48 This is a comprehensive model, which can be compared to Cox’s (1993) interactional model of the impact of diversity on individual career outcomes and organisational effectiveness.   The model has the benefit of examining both individual and organisational outcomes and benefits, and mentions the importance of leadership.  This model attempts to builds on Cox’s (1993) model.  It highlights important components of a diversity management process flow and includes expected individual and organisation level benefits and outcomes.  Much like Cox’s (1993) model, the model does not provide an organisation with details as to how to manage diversity, but it provides a process flow which highlights the presence of important drivers such as leadership in order to achieve both individual and organisation benefits.  The organisation context is important in understanding the approach to be employed in managing diversity.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a) claim that depending on the paradigm organisations are using to manage diversity, the following behaviour is found:  1. Exclude diverse individuals as far as possible.  2. Deny or mitigate the effects of diversity by denying that individuals are different- pretend that ‘we are all the same’.  3. Follow the assimilation route (which is the most common approach in South Africa).  4. Actively suppress differences that appear.  5. Compartmentalise differences into departments or units and create ‘homophile’ environments where Black recruits are allocated to Black managers.  6. Tolerate difference, where superficial interaction is promoted.  7. Build relationships which may encourage dialogue.  8. Mutual adaptation, where everyone accommodates changes.    Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a:88) suggest that managing diversity requires organisations to be proactive and to move away from an affirmative action model: ‘It is time to finally agree that diversity management is not affirmative action or quota systems.  Diversity management is a corporate or managerially initiated strategy.  It can be proactive and is based on operational reality to optimize the use and contributions of an increasingly diverse national workforce.  Affirmative action is reactive and based on government law and moral imperatives’.   Depending on how they were managed, the first two points of Gilbert and Ivancevich’s model listed above are likely to be applicable to monocultural organisations, according to the Holvino (1998) model outlined above.  Points three to six are likely to be transitional and points seven and eight are likely to be multicultural.  Aligned to Thomas and Ely (1996) and Dass and Parker’s (1999) models, points one and two are likely fall under resistance.  Points three to five are likely to fall under the fairness and discrimination paradigm (Thomas & Ely, University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     49 1996), which Dass and Parker (1999) term the defensive paradigm.  Points six is likely to fall under Thomas and Ely’s (1996) access and legitimacy paradigm and is accommodative according to Dass and Parker (1999). Point seven falls within the learning and effectiveness paradigm, and is proactive according to Dass and Parker (1999).   Like the other models that provide guidance around classifying an organisation paradigm, this discussion provides insight into differentiating features of the paradigms.  The list is perhaps over-simplistic and fails to provide deep insight into differentiating characteristics of the organisations.  It uses one component of diversity to differentiate organisation types which has the danger of being over-simplistic.  Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000b) suggest that the following actions are necessary in order to create a multicultural organisation. First, the case that managing diversity is a contributor to organisational performance needs to be made.  They indicate that to create inclusion, alternative ways of perceiving reality must be made available.  Second, a plan to achieve diversity needs to be constructed.  In a multicultural organisation, commitment to diversity needs to be reviewed against whether there is respect for individuals and appreciation for contributions each can make; whether diversity is accepted and valued; whether there is concern and fair treatment for individuals in managing business change, whether there is equal opportunity for each employee to achieve his or her potential, whether employees experience pride and enthusiasm and whether employees are kept informed through open communication.  Third, an ongoing education plan that focuses on diversity issues needs to be developed.  Fourth, hard measures of diversity benefits should be developed to ensure that focus on diversity continues during hard economic times, and linking diversity to revenue and cost equations may be an eye-opening experience for the most resistant managers.  Fifth, employees need to be made accountable by managers, and they need to understand yearly goals and policy changes related to diversity.   Building on the need for more insight and information around creating multicultural organisations, Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000b) outline numerous considerations for organisations.  Their insights are well presented and are an insightful depiction of the characteristics of a multicultural organisation.  These considerations can be compared with the contributions of Thomas, R.R. (2006), Booysen (2007a) and Human (2005) who provide a combination of operational and strategic guidance to managers.  It could also be compared to Cox and Blake’s (1991) model but lacks the structure provided by the ‘model University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     50 dimensions’.  While some of the considerations listed by Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000b) are output driven, many are inputs which could be misinterpreted during the implementation stage.  This echoes the concern highlighted by the author earlier that a model which raises inputs instead of outputs allows for possible misinterpretation of the inputs and therefore risks non-delivery against the final outcome of a multicultural environment.   2.4.1.7 Allen and Montgomery (2001) Allen and Montgomery outline a change approach to managing diversity and which involves unfreezing, moving and refreezing.  Top management begins the ‘unfreezing’ process by showing commitment and providing vision to the new process.  This is done through the use of symbolic communication and actions which show their support for the diversity vision.  The diversity steering committee is responsible for identifying a list of critical competencies that will be required for the organisation to be successful in the future and setting measurable diversity improvement goals.  ‘Moving’ is about movement towards diversity, and should include practices such as recruiting and outreach programs, co-op and internship programs, training and educational programs and mentoring and career development programs.  ‘Refreezing’ begins by reviewing existing policies and procedures to ensure they support the new culture of diversity.  Job descriptions and job evaluation language should be edited to reflect inclusive language, and fair pay systems that reward comparable pay for comparable value should eliminate pay disparities that exist.   The change approach suggested by Allen and Montgomery (2001) is a welcome addition to the field of diversity management which is difficult to change.  While authors such as Thomas, R.R. (20006); Cox and Blake (1991) and Holvino (1998) mention change management in their considerations, Allen and Montgomery (2001) are the first authors to suggest a change approach for diversity management.  While Booysen (2007a) and Human (2005) do not mention that their frameworks are change models, both approaches provide structured guidance to improve diversity management in the organisation.  While Allen and Montgomery (2001) provide useful insight into areas that need to be changed, the change process could be regarded as somewhat simplistic, and fails to recognise that diversity management is an ongoing process, not an intervention.  A second shortfall of this model is that it fails to consider the paradigm the organisation is shifting from and assumes for example that a resistance paradigm (Dass & Parker, 1999) requires the same intervention as an accommodative paradigm (Dass & Parker, 1999).  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     51 2.4.1.8 Booysen (2007a) Booysen (2007a) introduces an integrated approach to diversity management in South Africa.  There are four phases to the model, all underpinned by communication.  Phase one involves the planning and design of a “valuing diversity” culture.  The steps include visible top management commitment, forming a diversity leadership team, organisational diversity diagnoses and assessment, and creating a diversity vision.  The desired outcomes of this phase are: top management commitment, a powerful diversity leadership team, resource allocation, building awareness of need for change, stimulating dialogue, building the business case, getting everyone on board, understanding of diversity issues in the organisation and a diversity vision.    Phase two involves developing and implementing “valuing diversity”.  These steps are to develop a “valuing diversity” strategic plan, and to implement the “valuing diversity” plan.  The desired outcomes are: a diversity management strategy, mainstreaming “valuing diversity” as part of global business strategy, to challenge old paradigms, mindset shift, cross-culture competency, and alignment of employee relations systems with the valuing diversity vision.    Phase three involves evaluating and communicating “valuing diversity” progress.  These steps are to evaluate and measure results and to disseminate the results.  The desired outcomes are progress reports on the “valuing diversity” strategic plan, the opportunity to adapt the “valuing diversity” strategic plan, and information sharing with employees on progress.    Phase four involves institutionalising a “valuing diversity” culture which involves ensuring integration and accountability, and ongoing monitoring and analysis. The desired outcomes are employee accountability towards valuing diversity, integration of a “valuing diversity” organisational culture and the institutionalisation of culture change.   Booysen’s (2007a) model is comprehensive, clear and is divided into phases, which simplifies the interpretation and makes the implementation of the model accessible to practitioners.  As mentioned earlier, the structured approached allows this model to be compared to Allen and Montgomery’s (2001) change model but builds on the strategic considerations highlighted by Thomas, R.R. (2006).  The greatest strength of this model is that it is outcomes driven.  This approach is an improvement on Cox and Blake (1991) and University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     52 Gilbert and Ivancevich (1999) who highlight inputs which need to be considered.  The key difference is that organisations that pursue a range of inputs are likely to interpret the inputs differently which affects delivery against the required goals.  However, if organisations focus on achieving specific outcomes (through inputs of their choice), this is more likely to result in achieving the goal of a multicultural organisation.  Like Allen and Montgomery (2001), this framework fails to consider the paradigm the organisation is operating from, which is an important consideration when determining the interventions the organisation requires.  A further shortcoming of this model is that it fails to consider the individual component of the diversity climate and focuses on the management of diversity on an organisational level.     2.4.1.9  Human (2005) Human (2005) recommends the following process for managing diversity: first, clearly define what the organisation means by ‘diversity’, second, clearly define the business case, third, communicate the business case, forth, show management commitment to the case, fifth, audit and rank business and/or departments in terms of diversity performance, sixth, provide significant performance management of: business unit/departmental objectives and personal action plans, seventh, approve plans and finally, monitor plans.   Human (2005) supports this plan with a clear outline of what all the role players should be doing, which makes for a comprehensive diversity plan.  Human (2005), offers the following suggestions for managing diversity in a South African context: The first suggestion is that that diversity skills should underpin all other communication, from performance feedback to conflict management. The second suggestion is that perceptions of diversity management are inseparable from perceptions of management style, and self-assessments and 360 degree assessments could be used in developing a personal action plan.  A third consideration is that diversity skills should extend to effective coaching skills, enabling constructive criticism and meaningful performance feedback.  Managers require the skill to put into place a department or function-specific action plan which can be monitored and updated on a regular basis.  A diversity strategy should be integrated into business and consultative planning. Reviewing and monitoring mechanisms should be put in place.   Human (2005) extends this plan to contain detail about the functions of the different role players, which is very useful in an organisation where the role players involved in driving diversity management are not sure of  how they can add maximum value to the process.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     53 While the plan does appear to be over-simplified, the functional detail provides greater insight into the implementation of a diversity management initiative.  The framework is similar to the work of Allen and Montgomery (2001) and Booysen (2007a), who provide a structured approach to improve diversity management in an organisation towards achieving the aim of a multicultural organisation.  Much like Booysen’s (2007a) model, the limitations of this model are that it fails to deal with individual level barriers to diversity and inclusion and it fails to consider the current organisational paradigm, which might influence the managing diversity ‘process’.  A further limitation is that the proposed initiative is outlined as an intervention and does not consider long term continuity.   The models of diversity management provide a range of different approaches to diversity management.  Cox (1991), Holvino (1998), Thomas and Ely (1996), Dass and Parker (1999) and Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000a) provide paradigms to structure or rank organisations against the goal of a multicultural organisation.  Cox (1993) and Gilbert, Ivancevich and Stead (1999) consider models which discuss the expected individual and organisation outcomes of diversity management.  Thomas, R.R. (2002, 2006), Cox and Blake (1991) and Gilbert and Ivancevich (2000b) discuss various components of operational and strategic concerns in organisations.  Allen and Montgomery (2001), Booysen (2007a) and Human (2005) provide a more structured and phased approach to managing the operational and strategic concerns of diversity management.  The progression of thought over time does not appear to have affected the type of frameworks or guidance provided by these thought leaders.  This could be attributed to the range of paradigms that organisations are operating within, which lends itself to a broad range of guidance.  Collectively these considerations facilitate a comprehensive understanding of diversity management.  While many researchers outline diversity management strategies in support of inclusive environments, there are some academics who specifically discuss inclusion approaches.  In the next section, the research of Pless and Maak (2004), Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (2008) are examined.    2.4.2 Inclusion approaches 2.4.2.1 Pless and Maak (2004) Pless and Maak (2004) in their model of inclusion suggest that the following founding principles of inclusion are the essential for a house of inclusion to be built.  They are firstly the principle of recognition, which encompasses emotional recognition, solidarity and legal and political recognition.  The principle of reciprocal understanding is the second point and University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     54 relates to individuals understanding each other and the organisation.  The third principle relates to standpoint plurality, which relates to individuals being open to other ideas and mutual enabling, where divergent and marginalised voices are activated.  The fourth principle is trust, the fifth is integrity and the sixth principle highlights the need to have an intercultural moral point of view where the barriers to diversity are transcended.    Pless and Maak (2004) further state that in order to create a culture of inclusion, the following competencies need to be developed: first, showing respect and empathy; second, recognising the other as different but equal; third, showing appreciation for different voices, by actively listening to them; trying to understand disparate viewpoints and opinions; integrating different voices into the ongoing cultural discourse; fourth, practising and encouraging open and frank communication in all interactions; fifth, cultivating participative decision making and problem solving processes and team capabilities; sixth, showing integrity and advanced moral reasoning, especially when dealing with ethical dilemmas; and seventh using a cooperative/consultative leadership style.  Pless and Maak (2004) propose that human resource processes such as recruitment of people from diverse backgrounds and performance evaluation to stimulate dialogue between employees are important.  Human resource development which in their model extends to succession planning, training program, mentoring, team development and ongoing workshops on awareness, understanding and reflection are regarded as important.  Finally, they discuss inclusive reward and compensation practices which includes salaries and bonuses.  Like Allen and Montgomery (2001), Pless and Maak (2004) outline a change approach which involves raising awareness, creating understanding and encouraging reflection, developing a vision of inclusion, rethinking key management concepts and principles, and adapting human resources systems and processes.   Pless and Maak (2004) provide a comprehensive approach for managing diversity and inclusion.  They outline the importance of managing inclusion at an individual level, but also outline the importance of organisation level intervention.  The change approach, while simple, provides clear insight into practical elements of the change process.  While many of the steps in this process are likely to be ongoing processes, a limitation of this model is that it fails to explicitly discuss managing diversity and inclusion as a process.    University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     55 2.4.2.2 Louw (1995) Louw (1995) proposes that transformative work must occur at personal, interpersonal and organisational levels.  Louw (1995) asserts that the interrelatedness of the items means that action in one area will inevitably lead to action in the other.   Louw (1995) suggests that at a personal level, there is a need to become aware of unconscious assumptions, biases, prejudices and stereotypes, to become aware of personal, interpersonal and organisational barriers to valuing diversity, to explore differences and similarities, to model the behaviour expected from others, to participate through providing feedback and to become involved in helping the organisation to develop, implement and maintain a diversity strategy.  At an interpersonal level; there is a need to communicate respect and interact with people who are different, to facilitate unique contributions by encouraging participation with others, to resolve conflicts in a way that values and respects differences and all stakeholders should accept responsibility for developing common ground.  At an organisational level employees should participate in diversity networks and focus groups and they should take a proactive role in promoting diversity within the organisation.  Employees could also be involved in the drive for  more diverse workforce.    Louw (1995) provides insight into the components that need to be managed on an individual, interpersonal and organisation level.  The strength of this model is that diversity and inclusion factors are output based.  Further, the model is practical and addresses operational concerns which are sometimes overlooked in favour of a more strategic agenda.  Secondly, the model influences systemic change, and is not a once-off intervention.  A limitation of this model is that it fails to consider the role of leadership in diversity and inclusion, and from an organisational perspective, fails to mention the role of systemic support structures, such as human resources policies, human resources development and so forth.  While this approach is not directly comparable with Pless and Maak (2004), there is some overlap within the content of the models.  Louw (1995) uses a similar framework to Schultz et al. (2008) who discuss the management of inclusion at individual, interpersonal and organisational levels.   2.4.2.3 Schultz et al. (2008) Like Louw (1995), Schultz et al. (2008) outline a model that needs to be managed at organisational, interpersonal and personal levels (Figure 2.4 below).    University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     56 The personal level concerns the individual, where there is engagement in continuous learning, understanding of personal attitudes and behaviours, and identification of personal assumptions, beliefs and biases.  The interpersonal component concerns building diverse or inclusive relationships where people seek to listen to and understand each other, challenging behaviours that exclude and limit optimal interaction, building inclusive work teams and groups, and forming productive relationships.  The organisational level concerns developing the process through a diversity and inclusion plan to build tools, systems and processes.  The plan should include developing goals and accountabilities, modelling desired behaviour and communication, ensuring that measures that link diversity to performance are in place, devising a plan for resourcing and identification, and removing barriers to a diverse and inclusive environment.               Figure 2.4: Inclusion: Three Levels of Organisational Focus  Source: Replicated from Schultz et al., 2008  Schultz et al. (2008) provide insight into elements of diversity and inclusion which need to be managed at individual, interpersonal and organisational levels.  While the model provides insightful components that need to be managed, Louw’s (1995) model is more specific in terms of how the organisation is expected to deliver.  A strength of the model is that while it does not directly discuss the role of leadership, the organisational component is headed ‘lead the process’, which recognises the role of leadership from an organisational perspective.  Limitations of the model include the lack of consideration around the paradigm the organisation is moving from, and like Louw (1995), it neglects the change component of the model which is highlighted by Pless and Maak (2004).

(2008) suggest that a diverse and inclusive environment requires three levels of organisational focus.  These inclusion approaches differ from the diversity management processes in that they are more focused on activities which affect an individual's perception of inclusion.  While all of these inclusive approaches have their merits, Pless and Maak (2004) have the most comprehensive approach because it includes a management strategy component which is missing in the two other outlined approaches.  Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (2008) address how inclusion should be managed at organisation, interpersonal and individual levels but fail to address the role of management or leadership.  The approaches outlined above are useful in understanding how diversity or a multicultural environment can be driven at a national level.  However, it fails to address things to be considered on an international level where the complexity of the problem is significantly enhanced.   The following three models outline a global approach to diversity management. The first, Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007), outlines a comprehensive global inclusive approach to managing diversity. Thereafter, international approaches to driving inclusive environments (Mor Barak, 2000b, Gardenswartz, Rowe, Digh & Bennett, 2003) will be examined.   2.4.3 Global approaches to diversity and inclusion 2.4.3.1 Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) suggest that global diversity management starts with including global units of an organisation which extends to seeking and using global input for decisions that affect them.  Second, human resource management needs to be flexible and needs to understand the local context, and design and implement culturally consistent management policies, practices and procedures.  Third, global diversity definitions and practices should be established which are sensitive to cultural context, unifying organisational diversity initiatives.  Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) suggest that this should be done in collaboration with cultural ‘informants’ who can share local knowledge and norms with headquarter representatives.  Once this has been established, local directors of diversity programs should help define diversity that is sensitive to the local cultural context.  This process should extend to establishing goals and targets for alleviating specific sources of discrimination that are defined locally, but should align to the goals and objectives of the global diversity strategy.  The fourth and last component is about the development of global competencies by ensuring that employees worldwide have opportunities to broaden their outlook and develop University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     58 their ability to work effectively with people from different countries.  This involves international assignments as part of  systematic talent development, cross-cultural training for all employees with global contacts, inclusion of employees in global work teams and the encouragement of cross-national social networks.   Top management is seen as an important antecedent to global diversity and its beliefs and attitudes, demographics, cultural intelligence, prior international experience and interpersonal relations are important.  The success of the program also depends on whether the culture of the organisation is monolithic, pluralistic or multicultural.   Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) outline numerous outcomes of the model.  When an organisation achieves inclusion of global units, appropriate flexibility in human resource management, culturally sensitive diversity definitions, and the development of global competencies among employees, it will likely benefit from global knowledge creation, sharing and dissemination across units.  A second outcome deals with stakeholder reactions to an organisation’s global diversity programme.  The more context-sensitive definitions and practices are, the more likely it is that global employees will accept the global inclusion effort.  A third outcome involves performance and levels of innovation.  Some additional performance metrics include greater responsiveness to global customers, greater performance across global units in terms of product or service quality, better health and safety records, and greater success of international assignees.  The last outcome Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) propose is employee engagement.  They suggest that organisations that effectively manage global diversity will tend to have worldwide employees who report a sense of being ‘included’ as valuable members of the global firm, higher levels of perceived organisational support, positive perceptions of organisational justice, job satisfaction and organisational commitment, and greater perceived mobility and advancement potential.  They conclude by saying that global organisations that effectively manage their international diversity will create a self sustaining cycle.    Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) provide a comprehensive look into managing diversity globally.  The model addresses leadership and other organisational inputs and examines possible expected outcomes.  An additional strength of the model is that it recognises the need for diversity management to be a process, not a once-off intervention.  A limitation of the model is that while it does consider the operating paradigm, it assumes that all the international divisions are operating on the same or similar paradigms, which could limit the success of University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     59 the rollout.  While Nishii and Ozbilgin’s (2007) model examines factors to be considered when driving inclusion in multinationals, Mor Barak (2000) and Gardenswartz et al. (2003) examine the systems which affect inclusion in organisations.   2.4.3.2 Mor Barak (2000b) Mor Barak (2000b) proposes that an organisation’s value system is influenced by a micro- to macro-system, and that inclusion should be managed at all of those levels.  The micro-level starts with inclusion and diversity within work organisations, and involves individuals and groups within the organisation.  Mor Barak (2000) mentions that organisations do not operate on either exclusion or inclusion extremes, but usually operate somewhere in-between.  Further, exclusion at this level involves conformity to pre-established organisational values and norms, and inclusion is a pluralistic, co-evolving organisation culture.   Moving towards the macro-inclusion and corporate community relations involves organisations and communities.  A manifestation of this level would be exclusive responsibility to the financial stakeholders, and the focus of the organisation would be intrinsic.  An inclusive manifestation would be recognition of community systems as stakeholders.  There is dual intrinsic and extrinsic focus.  Inclusion and welfare-to-work programmes are the third system level, and include state and federal government.  From an extreme exclusion perspective, poor working people would be treated as disposable labour and from an inclusive perspective, they would be regarded as a potentially stable upwardly mobile labour force.  Inclusion and economic globalisation is the macro-extreme, and operates at an international level.  The exclusion-extreme perspective is culture specific, competition based and has a nationalistic focus.  The inclusion extreme perspective is pluralistic, collaboration based and is focused on global mutual interests.   The strength of Mor Barak’s (2000b) model is that it considers the influence of the macro-environment on inclusion within an organisation.  The strength of this model is that it offers a valuable perspective on managing diversity and inclusion and it considers the operating paradigm of the organisation.  A limitation of the model is that the insight for managing diversity and inclusion within an organisation is somewhat broad, and does not consider the individual's role in diversity and inclusion in the organisation.  Mor Barak’s (2000b) model can be compared to the Gardenswartz el al. (2003) model, which considers the influence of civil and national considerations on organisational inclusion.  While Mor Barak (2000b) University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     60 references specific civil and national concerns, the overlap suggests that civil and national considerations should be considered when creating inclusive organisations.   2.4.3.3 Gardenswartz, Rowe, Digh and Bennett (2003) Gardenswartz et al. (2003) examine the influence of societal impact on organisations.  They propose a six sphere model to increase the understanding of global diversity encounters, whether interpersonal or organisational, including civilisation, national, organisational, societal, individual identification factors and personality.    Civilisation factors are the civilisation which an individual most identifies with, such as Western or African..  National identification includes the degree of independence-dependence-interdependence of their citizens and their relationships with other nations in their region of the world; the inclusion and exclusion processes for minorities, be they ethnic, racial, religious, or any other subset; the establishment or not of interpersonal and intergroup hierarchy; the strength of the political structure and the process of influence; the range of formal and informal social hierarchy among its citizens; the balance of individualism and collectivism among people; the distribution of wealth and sharing of national assets; the structure and purpose of the national economy; and mechanisms to reinforce and in some cases enforce national identity, such as governmental communication, public relations campaigns, or propaganda.  Organisational factors inform our approaches to organisational dimensions of diversity such as management status, work location, union affiliation, division/department/work unit, functional level clarification, seniority, and work content or field.  Gardenswartz et al (2003) suggest that the organisation serves as the mediator between influences like the civilisation, national and personal diversity dimensions that people bring to the workplace.  Societal formation includes socialisation factors that make a difference in the workplace like geographic location, appearance or recreational habits, personal habits, family structure, parental status, marital status, income, religion and educational background.  Individual identifications that constitute our identity are race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical ability and age.  Gardenswartz et al. (2003) assert that personality is the deepest and most intangible level of diversity and inclusion.  It supports interpersonal relationships identified with behavioural patterns such as flexibility, adaptability, tolerance and risk-taking.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     61 The strength of Gardenswartz et al.’s (2003) model is that it considers factors influencing the management of diversity and inclusion from a civilisation perspective to an individual level. This provides insight into the variety of factors which directly or indirectly influence an individual's perception of inclusion.    The range of approaches outlined by Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007), Mor Barak (2000b) and Gardenswartz et al. (2003) is broad.  While Nishii and Ozbilgin (2007) focus on a model aimed at delivering an inclusive organisational environment globally, Mor Barak (2000b) outlines a model examining inclusion and exclusion at organisational, community, government and global levels.  Gardenswartz (2003) examines the demographic elements at play in an inclusive environment as a means to understand the components that need to be managed.  In an organisational setting, Nishii and Ozbilgin’s (2007) model is likely to be the most practical, but could be supplemented using the insights of Mor Barak (2000b) and Gardenswartz (2003) who review global inclusion management from a different perspective.  In section 2.4.1 above, approaches to the management of diversity are discussed.  These approaches provide clarity about the management of diversity through discussion about the range of organisation paradigms; models, which highlight the inputs and outputs of a diversity management system, and implementation guidelines for leaders and managers.  These three approaches are useful for managers and leaders to become better equipped to manage diversity in their environments.   In section 2.4.2 inclusion models are discussed.  These models collectively provide organisations with guidance on how to create inclusive environments.  In section 2.4.3 global approaches to the management of diversity are discussed which provide multinational organisational organisations with guidance about how to manage diversity and create inclusive environments.    As discussed in chapter one, current diversity management practices in South Africa organisations are failing to deliver meaningful demographic transformation of South African organisations.  To achieve transformation, a comprehensive approach to diversity management which considers both the demographic and culture transformation of South African organisations is necessary (Horwitz et al., 2002).  While the above theories collectively contribute to the possible transformation of South African organisations, there is University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     62 a need for a diversity and inclusion model which is tailored to the specific needs of South African organisations.  Question three of this research addresses this concern.    2.4.4 Inclusion elements Question three of this research is about understanding which elements relate strongly to an individual’s perception of inclusion in a South African context.  As the diversity and inclusion models discussed above largely focus on an implementation strategy, the question about which elements need to be transformed to create an experience of inclusion remains to be answered. The following paragraph lists elements which authors have deemed to be important in contributing to an individual’s experience of inclusion in the workplace:  1. Representation of diverse groups (Roberson, 2006; Gasorek, 2000);  2. employees feel that their contributions are valued (Gasorek, 2000);  3. participative decision making and problem solving processes (Gasorek, 2000; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Pless & Maak, 2004);  4. being empowered to make career decisions (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Roberson, 2006);  5. being able to show and experience integrity and advanced moral reasoning (Pless & Maak, 2004);  6. using/experiencing a cooperative leadership style (Pless & Maak, 2004; Roberson, 2006);  7. having access to sensitive information including formal and informal discussions resources (Pelled, Ledford & Mohrman, 1999; Davidson & Ferdman, 2002);  8. being able to use individual talents, making a difference through being part of a successful initiative or conducting a meaningful task (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002);   9. feeling validated, accepted, and appreciated (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002); 10. having successful cross departmental integration (Gasorek, 2000);  11. employees experience a belonging in the organisation and prospective employees are attracted to the organisation (Gasorek, 2000); 12. people feel connected to each other, the organisation and its goals (Gasorek, 2000);  13. the organisation continuously fosters flexibility and choice, and attends to diversity (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Gasorek, 2000);  14. having some work autonomy (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002);  15. having one’s input solicited (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Avigdor et al., 2007)  16. appreciation of different voices which extends to employees contributions being heard (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Pless & Maak, 2004);  17. work group involvement (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Pless & Maak, 2004),  18. openness for dialogue and open and frank communication (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Avigdor et al., 2007; Pless & Maak, 2004; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998);  19. access to resources (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998);  20. receiving feedback (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002);  21. wanting to learn from others (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002);  22. fair treatment (Avigdor et al, 2007; Roberson, 2006);  23. showing and experiencing respect (Pless & Maak, 2004); 24. recognition for University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     63 others (Pless & Maak, 2004); 25. employee involvement (Roberson, 2006);  26. self perception (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998) and  27. job security (Pelled, Ledford & Mohrman, 1999).  Given the frequency of citations, the items that are likely to be important in influencing a perception of inclusion in the workplace are likely to be the following: participative decision making and problem solving processes (Gasorek, 2000; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Pless & Maak, 2004); being able to make career decisions (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Roberson, 2006); experiencing work group involvement (Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Pless & Maak, 2004), and experiencing an openness for dialogue and open and frank communication (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Avigdor et al., 2007; Pless & Maak, 2004; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998).   The broad range of elements which influence individual perception of inclusion makes the implementation this theory more complex for practitioners within organisations who are searching for comprehensive inclusion solutions.  This disjointed approach strengthens the need for a comprehensive model of diversity and inclusion (question three of this research).    2.5 PERFORMANCE REVIEW LITERATURE Question two of this research examines the relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance.  The following section examines literature related to the performance appraisal process.  Boase (1997:86) defines performance appraisal as ‘the periodic, formal evaluation of an employee’s job performance which may serve a variety of purposes, the main one being to enhance the ability of the individual to work within the vision and values of the organisation’.  Armstrong (2001:180) says, ‘performance appraisal is the systematic evaluation of an individual with respect to his (her) performance on the job and his (her) potential for development’.  Appraisals are conducted to ensure that employees are evaluated fairly.  Katz (1996) suggests that important outcomes of appraisals include the retention and promotion of staff.  Cascio (1995) proposes that the major organisational purpose of the appraisal is to improve performance and to provide information to both line managers.  Longnecker (1997:212) suggests that ‘these benefits will be difficult to achieve if the members of the organisations do not use the appraisal process in an effective fashion’. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     64 Organisations are unique with regard to management style, organisational cultures, and the nature of industry and products.  It is therefore inappropriate to implement a single performance appraisal system throughout different organisations (Katz, 1996; Henderson, 1984).  The appraisal scheme should be chosen in line with the outcomes the organisation wishes to produce.  There are numerous performance appraisal techniques which include multi-rater assessment (or 360 degree feedback), critical incident technique, graphic rating scale, forced choice scale, essay appraisal, checklist method, ranking method, paired comparison and work standards (Shaw, Schneider, Beatty & Baird, 1995; Gerber, Nel & Van Dyk, 1999; Klatt, Murdick & Schuster, 1985; Costigan, 1995; Boise & Kleiner, 1997).    Cascio (1995:282) says management by objectives (MBO) is not a measure of employee behaviour, but is a measure of each employee’s contribution to the success of the organisation.  Management by objectives was developed by Peter Drucker in 1954 (Halpern & Osofsky, 1990) and is an objective setting system that works through a cascade process through the entire organisation.  Objectives are set for the organisation, which are then transferred to the respective departments, which are referred to managers, and finally transferred to individual employees.  The aim is to align the employee’s objectives with the objectives of the organisation.  The process involves setting objectives for employees at the beginning of a review period and conducting a review of performance against the objectives at the end of the period.   Schweiger and Sumners (1994) propose that MBO is a powerful means to influence performance positively if the employee is aware of the goals and knows what must be accomplished to meet them, and if the employee accepts that the goals are aspirational.  While Muczyk and Reimann (1989) claim that MBO is a vital complement of leadership, Halpern and Osofsky (1990) provide a more discerning view and suggest that MBO derives it legitimacy from other disciplines.  They state that critics suggest that to add legitimacy to the process, it should include a panel of judges, it should clearly define goals and should enlist the commitment of the incumbent.  Ivancevich and Gluek (1983) add that if too many objectives are set at an organisational level, it may cause confusion to the MBO process.  They add that its application is limited when the objective goals are difficult to determine, and that it is difficult to relate the results of MBO to remuneration objectives.  Cascio (1995) highlights that there is too much emphasis on the short term, that management and supervisors need to be trained on the methodology and finally, that it can be considered a rigid control mechanism that intimidates rather than motivates. University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     65 Halpern and Osofsky (1990) question whether the MBO approach as Drucker (1954) developed, is sufficient to meet the organisation's needs if it needs to be customised.  While the principles of MBO are sound and are useful as a base system for performance management, Muczyk and Reimann (1989) suggest that instead of changing an organisation to use a traditional MBO system, which might not suit an organisation, the MBO system should be adapted to suit the organisation.     2.6 UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND PERFORMANCE.  The research relating the relationships between diversity and performance, and between inclusion and performance is not expansive.  Research related to social identity theory and self-categorisation (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) theories suggests that diversity is associated with negative performance outcomes.  While there is research showing that diverse groups relate positively to creativity, innovation and problem solving (Cox, 2003), there are few studies which show that improved workgroup performance is related to heterogeneous workgroups.  Benschop (2001:1197) ‘claims that theory development on the performance effects of diversity and the identification of adequate performance indicators in the context of diverse groups is sorely lacking’.   Avigdor et al. (2007) in discussing the relationship between inclusion and performance assert that people who feel more engaged and valued, and who believe they will be heard, will exert more effort on behalf of the group, thereby increasing performance.  Avigdor et al. (2007) propose that the amount of diversity in a group will moderate the relationship between the collective experience of inclusion and performance.  They suggest that as the diversity of a group increases, there is more varied knowledge and experience on which the group can draw.  They propose that diverse members bring unique points of view, different perspectives, and contribute new ways of looking at the task or project.  In increasingly diverse groups with high levels of collective experience of inclusion (EOI), the full range of contributions and perspectives are made available by members of the group, resulting in an outcome that should exceed the quality of any one individual’s output.    University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     66 Swann et al. (2008: 1396) find that ‘fostering individuation and self verification in diverse groups may maximise group identification and productivity’. In their model outlining antecedents of identification and performance in diverse groups, they indicate that when impressions of others are positive, more diversity is associated with more individuation, which implies less homogenisation.  Individuation is associated with self verification, which in turn is associated with identification with the group and performance on creative tasks.   Pearce and Randell (2004) find that when employees expect greater mobility, they experience lower workplace social inclusion. They also find that employees with great workplace social inclusion have higher job performance ratings than employees that perceive less workplace social inclusion. Thus, employees that do not experience high levels of workplace social inclusion can expect to have lower job performance ratings than individuals who do.  Their third finding is that the individual expectation of organisation mobility and job performance is moderated by individual perception of workplace social inclusion, suggesting that employees that don’t perceive high workplace social inclusion are less likely to have an expectation of organisation mobility and are likely to have low performance assessments from their supervisors.   In his research Fiedler (1966) shows that heterogeneous workgroups perform as well as homogenous groups but experience greater communication difficulties and have a less pleasant atmosphere than homogenous workgroups.  Ng and Tung (1998) find that compared to culturally homogenous work teams, heterogeneous teams experience higher productivity and financial profitability and lower absenteeism, despite lower organisational commitment, workplace coherence, job satisfaction and higher labour turnover.  Webber and Donahue (2001) find that different types of diversity do not have differential impacts on work group cohesion and performance.  Richard (2000) finds that racial diversity in combination with an organisation’s growth strategy will produce higher employee productivity, return on equity, and organisational performance.  Further, he suggests that where racial diversity is not combined with a growth strategy, organisations are not likely to see the benefits of diversity.    Milliken and Martins (1996:418) outline a business case for diversity, highlighting benefits on individual, group and organisational levels.     University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     67                Figure 2.5: Effects of Diversity in Organisational Groups  Source: Replicated from Milliken and Martins, 1996  Milliken and Martins (1996) outline that diversity has short term and long term consequences.  Depending on how diversity is managed, short term and long term benefits would be positive, but if not well managed, benefits would be expected to be less positive.  Short term consequences include: 1) affective consequences such as satisfaction, commitment, identification with the group, role ambiguity, role conflict, work-related friction, group social interaction, perceived discrimination and supervisor’s affect for subordinates; 2) cognitive consequences such as innovation, range of perspectives and number of quality ideas; 3) symbolic consequences such as the behaviour of lower level employees; 4) communication-related consequences including communication with group members and external communication.  Long term consequences occur on individual, group and organisational levels. Individual consequences include absenteeism, deviant behaviour, turnover and performance.  On a group level, turnover and performance are influenced, and on an organisational level turnover, performance and strategic changes are affected.  This implies that in order to completely harness all the components of diversity, organisations need to focus on retaining diverse individuals.  As group members become more comfortable with one another, they are likely to perform better.  Milliken and Martins (1996) outline that affective diversity, which is diversity of feeling and emotions, is expected to have an adverse effect on diversity outcomes.

Watson el al. (1993) suggest that this situation improves as the group spends more time together.  Cognitive outcomes, such as number of alternatives considered, quality of ideas, and the degree of cooperation in complex tasks in groups affect the group in potentially positive ways (Cox et al, 1991; McLeod & Lobel, 1992; Watson et al., 1993).  The same can be said for skill-based dimensions such as education, occupation and functional background; and industry experience has also generally been found to be associated with some cognitive benefits at the board, top management group, and organisational task group levels.  Communication-orientated outcomes suggest that members of diverse groups appear to communicate more formally and perhaps less frequently with each other than members of less diverse groups.  Symbolic diversity can have important effects on organisations’ outcomes because the composition of some organisational groups has symbolic significance for both internal and external stakeholders.   This model is comparable to Cox’s (1993) interactional model of the impact of diversity on individual career outcomes and organisational effectiveness which is outlined in Figure 2.3.  Where Milliken and Martins (1996) name different types of diversity, Cox (1993) outlines components which contribute to a diversity climate on individual, intergroup and organisational levels. While Cox (1993) combines the short and long term benefits in his reporting of the benefits, Milliken and Martins (1996) separate them into short and long term benefits. Combined, the models suggest that on an organisational level, diversity contributes to the market share, turnover, profitability and change goals of the organisation.   Gilbert, Stead and Ivancevich’s (1999) model of effective diversity management (Figure 2.6), supports the insights from these models and suggests that in addition to numerous benefits such as better decision making, representation and retention of quality minority individuals, business with a diverse and multinational consumer base and product line development; the organisation could expect to see penetration of the glass ceiling, increased integration, increased organisational attachment and decreased psychological dissonance at an individual level.  At an organisational level, expected outcomes are highlighted as being increased profit, market share and stock price.

She outlines that the environment, including factors like the labour market and global economy, affect the diversity management strategy of the organisation, but also impacts on the organisation at other levels.  The diversity management strategy affects HRM activities such as recruitment, selection, appraisal, development, planning and career management.  Collectively, these contribute to HRM affective, cognitive, symbolic and communicative outcomes which ultimately relate to individual, group and organisation performance.  Her research in two organisations finds that an organisation’s strategy for managing diversity influences both the processes of meaningful formation regarding diversity and the perception of performance effects.   Kochan, Bezrukova, Ely, Jackson, Joshi, Jehn, Leonard, Levine and Tomas (2002) outline that there is research suggesting that there is no relationship between diversity and performance, and there is research indicating a relationship in some groups and not in others in the same organisation.  They suggest (Figure 2.7) that the relationship between diversity and performance is dependent on organisational context.     University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     70            Figure 2.7: Effects of diversity on group processes and outcomes  Source: Replicated from Kochan et al. (2002:11).  As outlined above, there are varying views on the relationship between diversity and performance.  While Benschop (2001) concludes that HRM strategies and activities mediate the performance effects of diversity, Kochan et al. (2002) argue that the positive and/or negative impact of diversity on outcomes such as performance hinges on organisational practices as well as on the culture and business strategy of the organisation, but has no direct impact itself.  That is, diversity operates through various group processes such as communication, negotiation or conflict resolution, and personal perception and stereotypes in turn impact on these.    The literature suggests that a positive relationship between diversity and performance is dependent on the organisational context, which includes the practices, policies and process of the organisation and the way the organisation approaches diversity management.  This is echoed by Avigdor et al. (2007), who suggest that studies over the last 10 years have shown mixed results, and contemporary investigations of the diversity-performance link typically find that the relationship depends on various process and context factors.  Katz and Miller (2005) suggest that in order to reshape a current organisation and position it for future waves of change,   conscious, sustained effort of committed, visionary leaders who are able to take risks and navigate through the turbulence is required.  Inyang (2009) asserts that managing diversity and inclusiveness has to be strategically linked to the goals of the organisation to enhance organisational performance.

While the researcher did not manage to find studies which examine the relationship between inclusion and individual performance (question two of this research), based on the related studies, it is probable that individual performance will be affected by the organisation’s management of his/her perception of inclusion.   2.7 ESTABLISHING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND INCLUSION/PERFORMANCE Question one of this research seeks to understand whether certain demographic factors relate to an individual's perception of inclusion.  Because the literature in this area is extremely limited, the researcher considers related literature which examines the relationship between demographic factors and inclusion but also demographic factors and other independent variables such as performance and innovation.     While there is research on the relationships between diversity characteristics and numerous variables such as turnover, communication and innovation, research examining the relationship between diversity characteristics and performance is not readily available.  While some studies find that certain diversity characteristics have a positive effect on individuals and small groups (Cox, Lobel & McLeod, 1991; Jackson, May & Whitney, 1995), others suggest that homogenous groups perform better than heterogeneous groups (Pelled, Eisenhardt & Xin, 1999; Tsui, Egan & O’Reilly, 1992).  Goodman, Ravlin, and Schminke (1987) highlight a second source of concern, which is that there is no significant proof that group cohesiveness is related to performance.  They propose that while cohesiveness is related to conformity and adherence to group norms, those norms may or may not facilitate performance.  Other research shows that increased team or organisational diversity can increase labour turnover, increase conflict and reduce social cohesion (Jackson, Joshi & Erhardt, 2003; Milliken & Martins, 1996; Webber & Donahue, 2001; Williams & O’Reilly, 1998).  These findings bring into question the findings of research that examines performance outputs of heterogeneous and homogenous teams.  In the next section, research investigating group and individual characteristics and their relationships with diversity variables is considered.  University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     72 Research into the relationship between demographic factors such as race, gender, education and age with performance does not produce encouraging results.  Jackson and Joshi (2004) find that team performance varies based on the combination of diversity available in the team.  Team performance is the lowest when there is a combination of high tenure, high gender and high ethnic diversity.  On a similar note, Ancona and Caldwell (1992) find that high levels of functional diversity (heterogeneity) is associated with lower levels of innovation, and the team’s own rating of its performance.  Further, Lincoln and Miller (1979) find that increased demographic similarity in terms of education affects the frequency of communication at work, and similarity on the grounds of race and gender affects friendship ties.  Jackson and Joshi (2004) find that the social context of the team may affect the effect of team diversity on performance.  Research by Tsui and Gutek (1999) finds that demographic similarity between the supervisor and subordinate on age, race or gender correlates with organisational outcomes such as higher performance ratings, organisation citizenship and lower role ambiguity and conflict.  Riordan and Shore (1997:342) find that ‘similarity in race-ethnicity affected individuals’ attitudes toward their work group, as well as perceptions of advancement opportunities’.  This suggests that race-ethnicity homogenous groups are likely to have an effect on the individuals’ attitude towards their group.  Riordan and Shore (1997) further add that no relationship was found between the similarity in gender and tenure in groups and individuals’ attitudes.  Richard (2000) finds that race is positively associated with productivity in companies pursuing a growth strategy, but is associated with lower productivity in companies downsizing or companies or without a clear strategy.  Jackson and Joshi (2004) find that for female managers, increasing gender diversity in the team results in performance declines, but for male managers, gender diversity in the team is unrelated to performance.   Research related to tenure has been conducted by Zenger and Lawrence (1989) who find that communication in teams is positively affected by the age and tenure of team members.  Ancona and Caldwell (1992) find that diversity of tenure shows a similar, albeit less strong, negative relationship with performance.  O’Reilly, Caldwell, and Barnett (1989) demonstrate that homogeneity of tenure is positively related to the group’s social integration and that the aggregate social integration of the group is related to reduced individual turnover.  Jackson and Joshi (2004) find that team performance is lower in areas with lower average tenure and with greater range in the tenure diversity.  Research by Harrison, Price and Bell (1998:96) finds that the ‘length of time group members worked together weakened the effects of University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     73 surface-level diversity and strengthened the effects of deep-level diversity as group members had the opportunity to engage in meaningful interactions’.    A meta study on the relationship between age and performance by Waldman and Avolio (1986) shows a negative correlation of -0.14.  This finding is supported by Craft, Doctors, Sckop and Benecki (1979) who find no evidence of age stereotyping in their research.  Further research by Waldman and Avolio (1986) finds that in fifteen of the cases involved in their meta study, where good measures of performance were available, a positive relationship exists, with a correlation of 0.27.  Rosen and Jerdee (1976) add that in their research, they find that the performance of older workers is negatively influenced by stereotypes which portray these individuals as less capable.  Older workers were also perceived to be less capable than younger workers in creative and productive job demands, in dealing with change, and were less able to cope with future challenges.  While individual upward mobility is seen to decrease with age, Pearce and Randell (2004) and Rosenbaum (1984) find that the percentage of promotions decreases with age. This finding is supported by a study by Cox and Nkomo (1992:206) who find that an ‘overall negative age effect for candidates over a wide range of ages may indicate that for candidates equal on performance, education and job tenure, younger contestants may be favoured because of the longer time after promotion and thus the greater total rewards for the system’.   The studies related to tenure suggest that similarity in tenure positively influences communication (Zenger & Lawrence, 1989), performance (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992; Jackson & Joshi, 2004) and social interaction (O'Reilly, Caldwell & Barnett, 1989). These findings are accounted for by Harrison, Price and Bell (1998) who suggest that similarity in tenure provides time for employees to engage in interactions which lead them to appreciate individual differences beyond those which are physically visible such as race or gender.   While studies show that age and performance are not linked (Waldman & Avolio, 1986;   Craft, Doctors, Sckop & Benecki, 1979), other research shows that when reliable measures of performance are used, age and performance are negatively linked (Waldman & Avolio, 1986).  It is further evident that older employees are disadvantaged by upward mobility (Pearce & Randell, 2004; Rosenbaum, 1984; Cox & Nkomo, 1992).  In summary, the research suggests that higher levels of demographic diversity in a team could result in lower team performance (Jackson & Joshi, 2004; Ancona & Caldwell, 1992; University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     74 Tsui & Gutek, 1999), lower levels of innovation (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992), lack of communication resulting in poor social cohesion (Lincoln & Miller, 1979), lower organisation citizenship, increased role ambiguity and conflict (Tsui & Gutek, 1999).  Research further suggests that race or ethnicity is likely to influence the attitude of the group (Riordan & Shore, 1997), and increased gender is likely to lead to performance declines (Richard, 2000).  While the findings of the relationship between demographic factors and outputs such as performance and innovation are not overwhelmingly positive, this might relate to the findings of section 2.6, which suggests that the benefits of diversity and inclusion are related to the effectiveness of the implementation of the diversity and inclusion strategy.  The implication therefore is that while the demographic characteristics appear to affect the results of team and organisational performance, the performance might be affected by the poor implementation of a diversity and inclusion strategy.    While the relationship between demographic characteristics and performance is featured in literature, the relationship between demographic characteristics and inclusion is inadequately researched.  Pelled, Ledford and Mohrman (1999) find that employees who are different from their work unit in race and gender tend to be less included compared to their co-workers.  Further, Pelled, Ledford and Mohrman (1999) find that individuals who are dissimilar from their groups but have more tenure or education show higher levels of inclusion than their colleagues.  In an inclusion study conducted in California and Israel, Findler et al. (2001) find that age and gender affects perception of inclusion.  In the California study, ethnicity, education and job category emerged as additional factors affecting inclusion.  These findings suggest that certain demographic characteristics relate more or less positively to perception of inclusion.  As discussed in chapter one, understanding which groups perceive inclusion more or less positively allows practitioners to focus their transformation efforts appropriately.       2.8 SUMMARY OF THIS CHAPTER The aim of this chapter was to provide the reader with context for this research. The chapter examined the factors that need to be considered in a South African context as well as the diversity and inclusion challenges that South Africans face as a result of Apartheid.  The review of literature further examined the benefits and costs of diversity considering commercial, moral and legal standpoints.  Definitions and approaches to diversity University of Cape TownChapter 2: Literature Review     75 management were explored, followed by a review of models of diversity and inclusion.  A review of literature with the aim of establishing inclusion elements followed.  Since question two of this research looks at the relationship between diversity and individual performance, performance review techniques used in this research were briefly analysed.  Finally, the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance was examined, along with the relationship between diversity characteristics, inclusion and performance. University of Cape TownUniversity of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 77  CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  3.1 RESEARCH QUESTIONS There are three main research questions for this study, the context for which is outlined in chapters one and two:  1. What is the effect of demographic variables on diversity and inclusion?  2. Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces?  3. What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa?   3.2 HYPOTHESES Eleven hypotheses were outlined for this research.  The first hypothesis tests the relationship between diversity, inclusion and individual performance.  As outlined in chapter two, there is limited data available on this relationship, and understanding whether there is such a relationship builds the commercial argument for a diverse and inclusive workplace.  The remaining hypotheses test the relationship between the perception of inclusion and a range of factors, which include race, gender, age, position or grade level, tenure, physical ability, sexual orientation, location and department.    The following hypotheses were tested: H01: There is no relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance in the research organisation. H1: There is a positive correlation between diversity and inclusion and individual performance in the research organisation.  H02: There is no relationship between gender and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation.

According to Emerald Group Publishing (2010), while quantitative research typically uses numbers and is deductive, qualitative research usually uses words and is intuitive.  When the methods are combined it is called triangulation.  Flick (2006) suggests that triangulation could be a mix of several qualitative methods or a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies.  It goes ‘beyond the limitations of a single method by combining several methods and giving them equal relevance’ (Flick, 2006:24).  Smith (2009) suggests that a mixed methodology is used to get the controlled, objective, systematic, valid and reliable benefits of quantitative analysis and a richer, deeper understanding of a problem or question being examined for qualitative research.  Dick (1979:3) suggests that this has the benefit of allowing the researcher to ‘capture a more complete, holistic, and contextual portrayal of the unit(s) under study’.  Matveev (2002) argues that the use of different research methods allows the researcher to build on the strengths of each method and to minimise its weaknesses.  Dick (1979:4) agrees, stating that ‘although it has always been observed that each method has assets and liabilities, triangulation purports to exploit the assets and neutralize, rather than compound, the liabilities’.  A combined approach was used to determine the components of diversity and inclusion (question three of this research) to ‘obtain knowledge about the issue of the study which is broader than a single approach and to mutually validate the findings of both approaches’ (Flick, 2006:40).  Questions one and two were explained using quantitative techniques.   3.3.1 Quantitative methodologies Smith (2009) suggests that some of the characteristics in favour of quantitative research are that it is objective, controlled, systematic, valid and reliable.  It is objective in that the researcher defines what is under study.  It is controlled because the data is defined, gathered and evaluated according to prescribed rules that can be reviewed for error and measured by University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 80 validity and reliability.  Matveev (2002) supports this and adds that organisations are able to establish research goals, arrive at more objective conclusions, test hypotheses and determine the issues of causality.  Silverman (2000:7), posing an alternative view, writes that ‘quantitative research can amount to a “quick fix” involving little or no contact with people or the “field”’.  Emerald Group Publishing (2010) suggests that a drawback could be that it might force people into categories and cannot go into much depth about subjects and issues.  Matveev (2002:3) describes further limitations as ‘failure to provide the researcher with information on the context of the situation where the studied phenomenon occurs’; ‘inability to control the environment where the respondents provide the answers to the questions in the survey’; and the ‘outcomes of the research [being] limited to those outlined in the original research proposal due to closed type questions and the structured format’.  The basis of this quantitative analysis is a survey called the InclusionIndex™.  Emerald Group Publishing (2010) indicates that a survey involves collecting a large amount of data from a large population, usually by questionnaires or structured interviews.  Usually it is a quantitative method involving ‘closed’ questions with a predetermined number of answers.  The advantage of surveys is that they are easy to complete, which could increase the chances of a high response rate.  The disadvantages of a survey align with those listed above: that the researcher cannot engage with the respondent to get a deeper understanding of the studied phenomenon, that the context of the response is not given, and that the respondent’s environment cannot be controlled and may affect the response positively or negatively.  The InclusionIndex™ survey provided data on individual views of diversity and inclusion, as well as some demographic information which was used to answer question one of this research.  The other quantitative data that was used was individual performance review data or scores from the performance management process of the organisation, which was used to test the relationship between inclusion and performance.  To establish the relationship between diversity, inclusion and the demographic variables; between diversity, inclusion and performance, and a combination of diversity, inclusion, demographic variables and performance, analysis was done using the quantitative dataset.   3.3.2 Qualitative methodology Miles and Huberman (1994) describe qualitative data as a source of well-grounded, rich descriptions and explanations of processes in identifiable local contexts.  They indicate that with ‘qualitative research the possibility for understanding latent, underlying, or non obvious issues is strong’, and the data is rich and holistic, which has the ‘potential for revealing University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 81complexity’ (Miles & Huberman, 1994:10).  However, the Emerald Group Publishing (2010) suggests that qualitative research has the drawback of having to focus on a few individuals, and it may therefore be difficult to generalise from the findings.  A further drawback of qualitative data is that of researcher bias, which could influence the recording and interpreting of data.  Silverman (2000:9) argues that qualitative research is unreliable since observers are inconsistent in how they ‘categorize the events or activities described’.   The qualitative component of this research included one-on-one semi-structured interviews, focus groups and qualitative insights recorded in the free text component of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  Flick (2006:149) observes that semi-structured interviews are most widely used because the ‘interviewed subjects’ viewpoints are more likely to be expressed in an openly designed interview situation than in a standardised interview or a questionnaire’.  Del Barrio, Gutierrez, Hoyos, Barrios, van der Meulen and Smorti (1999:1) indicate that ‘while the original script of the interview guarantees the uniformity of topics across the whole sample, each particular interview is different due to the new questions elicited by the particular answers given by the interviewee’.  Limitations of this methodology according to Del Barrio et al. (1999) are the inability to investigate causality between research phenomena, difficulty in explaining the variation in the quality and quantity of information obtained from numerous respondents, and arriving at different, inconsistent conclusions, lacking reliability.  The semi-structured interview was selected as a methodology to gain deeper insight and a more holistic perception of diversity and inclusion in the research environment.  A semi-structured interview allowed the researcher the flexibility to probe for deeper insight and had the benefit of a structured outline which was useful when interviewees digressed.   Morgan (1988) suggests that focus groups are used to produce data and insights that would be less accessible without the interaction found in a group environment.  He claims that they are useful for orientating to a new field, generating hypotheses based on informants’ insights and getting participants’ interpretations of results from earlier studies.  Hayden (2006) proposes that focus groups are good for discussing a particular topic to determine why people feel a certain way and elucidate steps in their decision-making process.  Flick (2006:199) suggests that ‘a challenge with focus groups is how to document data in a way that allows the identification of individual speakers and the differentiation between statements of parallel speakers’.  In this research, focus groups were used to solicit insight into what managers felt were the advantages of driving a diverse and inclusive environment University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 82 and the challenges associated with the same.  This question is relevant in order to understand the context for driving a diverse and inclusive environment.  Thirty three survey respondents contributed qualitative comments to the free text component of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  This information was used, along with the outputs from the focus groups and semi-structured interviews, for insight into the culture of diversity and inclusion in the organisation.  Understanding this culture is important when developing a model because it informs components that need to be driven for the model to be successful.  The data of these three methodologies, aggregated with some of the quantitative insights, enabled the researcher to build the final model (question three of this research), which illustrates the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate South Africa.   3.4 RESEARCH ORGANISATION For this study to be optimally effective, the research needed to be conducted in an established organisation with existing diverse representation.  While in principle this sounds simple, in South Africa many organisations are struggling to transform themselves to reflect the operating environment (Human, 1996b).  This context is critical in understanding why this research site was chosen.  In order for inclusion to be truly embraced by the culture of a company, the operating environment needs to represent the diversity of the country, and the organisation needs to be sufficiently established to move beyond the focus of meeting equity targets for legislative compliance to creating a climate of diversity and inclusion.  The organisation should ideally have mature human resource practices and processes which are effective in supporting and driving business performance.   In chapter one, it was mentioned that the research organisation is an established global multinational with an established division in South Africa.  This operation has seven production plants and is divided into five sales and distribution geographical regions.  This research was conducted in one of the sales and distribution regions: the division in the Eastern and Western Cape, located at the southernmost section of South Africa, which has a turnover in excess of R4 billion per year.  The head of unit, the General Manager (GM), reports to the head office located in Johannesburg.  There is an executive team which supports the GM in running the division.  They are based in various sites in the Eastern and University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 83Western Cape.  Employee headcount ranges between 400 and 425 permanent employees and with approximately the same number of contract staff.  The division operates as a decentralised unit with full accountability for achieving targeted volume within budget.  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are set nationally and are cascaded to the various divisions.  These KPIs are linked to incentives which are set against threshold, target and exceed targets or goal.  The targets are closely linked to the performance management system of the company.  This means that every employee has clear KPIs which are used in their individual assessments.   There is an operational union with representatives called shop stewards in all divisions of the company.  The union negotiates a national substantive agreement for shop floor employees yearly.  The rules are closely adhered to by both the shop floor and management, and the result is a relatively amicable relationship in the research division.  In addition to the annual negotiation of the national substantive agreement, which includes conditions of employment such as hours of work, meal subsidies and an annual bonus, the union negotiates salary increases for the shop floor every June.  The negotiations are not performance based, but rather consider inflation and market salary information.  The implication of this is that the performance management system of the company, which influences performance ratings and yearly salary increases, is not strictly adhered to at this level.  While shop floor individuals have a one-to-one meeting monthly with their manager, the six-month performance review that is in place for other employees is not a formal process at this level.   The organisation is pioneering and progressive by South African and international standards and started looking at embracing diversity as early as 1971, when South Africa was in the midst of apartheid.  The company was given public recognition for its progressive thinking in 2003 when it was awarded the Business Map Foundation Black Economic Empowerment Award.  Its Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) strategy has progressed and includes equity ownership, procurement, enterprise development, employment equity, skills development and corporate social investment.   Equity representation across all levels of the organisation ended at 74.4% at the end of financial year 2008.  Females made up about 30% of the organisation.  Middle and senior equity management numbers increased over the last four years, with 2008 ending at 57% and 53% respectively.  Female middle and senior management figures also increased over the last four years, ending at 38% and 24% at the end of 2008.  The above numbers are relevant University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 84 because they suggest that the research was run in a heterogeneous, representative environment.    3.5 RESEARCH METHOD Figure 3.1 outlines the methodology used for this research.   •Cronbach’s alpha•Measures of central tendency •Correlations•Confirmatory factor analysisBase measure of Diversity and Inclusion (using the Inclusion Index (II) Survey)•Qualita tive interviews•Focus groups•Qualita tive insights from the II.Model of Diversity and Inclusion• SEM (using factors from II factor analysis)•ANOVASDiversity and inclusion andPerformance• SEM (using factors from II factor analysis)•ANOVASDemographics and Diversity and Inclusion  Figure 3.1: Diagram outlining the research methodology Source: Author  As indicated earlier, to get to a base measure of diversity and inclusion, the researcher used a tool called the InclusionIndex™ survey.  The survey data was checked for reliability using a Cronbach’s alpha test.  Measures of central tendency and correlations were used to analyse the data.  To reduce the data, confirmatory factor analysis was used.  To answer questions one and two of this research – ‘what are the demographic characteristics that drive diversity and inclusion’ and ‘what is the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance’ – the researcher used the quantitative techniques called analysis of variance and structured equation models on the factors from the factor analysis.  To answer question three of this research – ‘what are the components used to drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate work environment’ – the researcher used a combined quantitative and qualitative approach.  This approach involved six focus groups to gain a better understanding of how managers view the advantages and challenges of diversity and inclusion in the workplace; the qualitative free text component of the InclusionIndex™ survey, which provided the researcher with an indication of diversity and inclusion culture; related literature from numerous academics; and forty two face-to-face semi-structured interviews to determine what employees felt influenced their perception of inclusion.  The semi-structured interview was constructed using the InclusionIndex™ data (quantitative) and related literature of University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 85numerous academics.  The methodologies are explained in more detail in the data analysis section below.  The next section discusses the instruments used to collect the data, and the data collection and preparation methodologies.  The data analysis techniques conclude this section.  3.5.1 Population and sampling frame This study was conducted over two-and-a-half years at the research organisation.  During this period, the employee base ranged between 400 employees and 425 employees with an annual turnover of between 12% and 15%.  The InclusionIndex™ Survey was run in August 2007 and all of the permanent employees in the division (403 employees) were invited to participate in the research survey.  The response rate of the survey was 64%, with 259 out of 403 employees completing the survey.  Only 248 of the 259 surveys were able to be used for the analysis because 11 were unusable due to incomplete information.  For the qualitative analysis, six diversity and inclusion focus groups, involving about 100 senior, middle and junior managers, were run from April to July 2008 to gauge individual and team issues with diversity and inclusion.  From September to November 2008 the researcher conducted 42 one-to-one interviews with a random stratified sample of employees to determine their qualitative views on things that affected their inclusion.   3.5.1.1 Sample for the InclusionIndex™ survey Welman and Kruger (1999) assert that the sample should be representative of the sampling frame, which ideally is the same as the population.  In this research, they differ slightly due to practical problems relating to the availability of the information.   Table 3.1 examines whether survey respondents reflect the categories present in the organisation such as gender, age, grade and tenure.  The employee base of the research division was 403 employees at the time of the research and 248 respondents returned complete surveys.  In the defined categories such as race, age and tenure, the numbers suggest that the sample generally reflects the research population across the various demographic groups.  For example, the table shows that while men constitute 69% of the research population in the division, 63% of survey respondents were male.  Similarly women constitute 31% of the organisation, but constituted 37% of survey respondents.

University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 87Racially, 32% of the respondents were White, 32% Black, 2% Indian, and 34% Coloured.  With respect to age, 13% of the respondents were between 16 and 25, 61% between 26 and 40, 17% between 41 and 50, and 9% between 51 and 60.  Employees with less than one year of service made up 9% of the sample, one to three years made up 41%, four and five years of service made up 9% of the sample, six to ten years made up 15% of the sample, and employees with 11 to 20 years of service made up 26% of the sample.  The variation between the sample and the actual population of this measure may have been caused by the wording of the survey: ‘How long have you been employed by the research organisation? _years_ months’, which might have caused some confusion.  Human resource managers indicated that people have varying views of how long they have worked for the organisation, based on whether they were contracted in the organisation before their permanent employment began.                        Figure 3.2: Demographic breakdown by grade level. Source: Author  Response from various grade levels (Figure 3.2) shows good dispersion throughout the various grades in the organisation.  As position had significant bearing on inclusion, sample representation on this demographic was important.  The research division operates across ten sites across two provinces in South Africa.  These sites are managed by four senior managers who report to the general manager located at a fifth site.  The main departments at the research sites are sales, operations and support.  Responses were representative of the population.

The objective of the qualitative component of this study, therefore, is to extract useful information from a small group of people on their views about diversity and inclusion.  Miles and Huberman (1994:27) indicate that ‘samples in qualitative studies are not wholly prespecified, but can evolve once fieldwork begins’.   The researcher started the sampling exercise with a stratified random sample of the group, ensuring representation from the various race groups, gender and positions.  This technique involves identifying strata (groups) and doing random sampling after the groups have been selected (Wisker, 2001).  In this study, the permanent employee base was classified into the various strata against ‘position’ and possible participants were ‘selected’.  Despite the intention of a stratified random sample approach, the sample evolved once the fieldwork had begun, because not all employees from the random sample who were invited to participate in the research agreed to contribute.  Since the researcher started the sampling with the intention of a stratified random sampling technique, the distribution across race, gender and position is somewhat representative (Table 3.2).    Table 3.2: Outline of the stratified random sample for the semi-structured interviews Source: Author    Shop floor employees, accounting for 21% of the total population of the organisation, were the least keen to participate in the research.  If any invited employee did not wish to participate in the research, random sampling was used to determine replacements.  This is consistent with advice of Miles and Huberman (1994), who propose that samples evolve once fieldwork begins.  Female employees, who constitute 31% of the total population of the organisation were more keen to participate in the research than male counterparts who make up 69% of the organisation's population.   University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 893.5.1.3 Sample for the focus group For the focus group sample, the researcher asked permission from the senior management team to hold focus group discussions with their management teams to solicit their insight into the advantages and challenges of driving a diverse and inclusive environment.  Six of the senior managers agreed that the researcher could run focus groups with their teams.  The researcher then invited managers from those six teams to participate in the research, making it clear that participation was voluntary.  The focus groups were hence not a random sample of managers, but an aggregation of junior, middle and senior managers, who collectively constituted a management team that was willing to participate in the research.  Of the 6 groups, 2 of the groups had of 15 participants.  The remaining groups consisted of 10, 9, 7 and 5 participants respectively.  The groups were made up by the demographics of individuals occurring naturally in that team, who agreed to participate in the research.  The representation of the focus groups is outlined in Table 37, Appendix C.  3.5.2 Instrumentation As discussed above, a combination of quantitative and qualitative instruments was used in this study.  The quantitative instruments were the InclusionIndex™ survey and individual performance data, and the qualitative data consisted of semi-structured interviews, focus groups and the qualitative insights from the InclusionIndex™ survey.   3.5.2.1 Instrument 1: InclusionIndex™ survey Welman and Kruger (1999) suggest that organisations use survey questionnaires to obtain information about the subject’s biological particulars, typical behaviour, opinions, beliefs and convictions, and attitudes.  The InclusionIndex™ survey was developed by Joerg Schultz (University of Hertfordshire), Mark Slaski (University of Hertfordshire), Eddie Blass (University of Hertfordshire) and Kurt April (Universities of Ashridge and Cape Town).  The ten factors were determined through a rigorous academic process, which involved correlational analysis and Principal Component Analysis (Schultz et al., 2008).  The tool is owned by a company called Performance Through Inclusion, which administers the roll-out and analysis of the tool across numerous industries globally, in the private and public sector.

(Performance Through Inclusion, 2006).  The survey contains 73 questions under the following ten categories: ‘Senior Managers’, ‘Immediate Manager’, ‘Values’, ‘Recruitment’, Promotion Progression and Development’, ‘Fitting In’, ‘Bullying and Harassment’, ‘Dialogue’,  ‘Organisational Belonging’ and ‘Emotional Well-Being’.    A Likert scale was used for respondents to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed with each statement or questionnaire item.  For components 1 to 9, a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) was used with an additional ‘don’t know’ column.  This column was not used by any of the respondents and will therefore be disregarded for this research.  Component 10, measuring emotional well-being used a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always), was excluded from this research due to the internal inconsistency of the data.   The survey also included a space for free text where employees could record other thoughts that they had regarding diversity and inclusion at the research site.  This was a valuable source of insight into the subject.  This qualitative data was analysed as part of question three of this research, which was to determine the components that drive diversity and inclusion in the work environment.  University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 91Employees were invited by senior management and human resources to participate through numerous methods of communication including e-mails, posters and existing communication forums, such as social system meetings.  In addition, a personal invitation to participate was sent to all employees from the general manager of the research site.  Of the 248 employees who completed the survey, 185 did so electronically and 64 filled out their responses on paper.  The web-based survey was hosted by Performance Through Inclusion on a secure URL.  All employees were given a unique username and password to log onto the site which allowed them access to the survey.  The paper-based surveys were sealed by the employee after completion and bulk posted by the human resource managers to Performance Though Inclusion, who captured the data.  After all the data was consolidated by Performance Through Inclusion, they forwarded the raw data to the researcher for analysis.  3.5.2.1.1 Questionnaire administration Prior to the survey roll-out, the researcher met with members from Performance Through Inclusion to discuss customisation of the demographic components of the survey to suit an organisation operating in South Africa.  Because the InclusionIndex™ survey had never previously been used in South Africa, the demographic and geographic dimensions were adapted by Professor April of the University of Cape Town (UCT), the administrators of the InclusionIndex™ (II) and the researcher.  Fields customised included race, religion, grade group, site location variants and department variants.  The customisation did not affect the nature of the survey itself.  Position in the company, work basis, location/site and department categories were customised according to the operation.  The ethnic group category was customised by Professor April of the University of Cape Town in accordance with South African ethnic groups, at the request of Performance Through Inclusion.  Other demographic variables that did not require customisation were gender, age, tenure, sexual orientation, religion and disability.  While the actual survey does not change, the process of demographic customisation is done with all the organisations where this survey is administered because these categories differ between companies.    As there is a significant cost associated with the implementation of the survey, the application of the survey was limited to this single division of the organisation.  The research looked specifically at employees of a sales and distribution fraternity.  The survey was introduced through communication from the General Manager.  Communication media that were used were the internal company magazine, e-mails, memos (notice boards).  University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 92 Communication came through the executive team and human resource managers located at the various sites.  During the roll-out of the survey the researcher dealt with queries and fed back response rates (provided by Performance Through Inclusion) to the human resource managers based at the various sites/locations.  The survey ran for one month, during which the respondents required encouragement to complete the survey.  Management and the human resource team were challenged on the reasons why the survey was conducted, and many respondents expressed concern over the confidentiality of their response despite reassurance that their responses would be treated with complete confidentiality.  Respondents were fearful of being publicly recognised by their demographic status.  The researcher feels that this is important to the research, as it may have skewed the responses of individuals and could have discouraged some employees from participating in completing the survey.  This suggests possible distrust present in the organisation.  3.5.2.2 Instrument 2: Performance data The measure of performance used in this survey is the performance review score, which forms part of a holistic performance management system.  The process is comprehensive and starts at a business planning level, where the national division revises its five-year strategy.  This strategy is fed down through the directors into departmental goals, which are cascaded down the hierarchy to regional level.  These goals inform the executive goal-setting session at regional level, which is done once yearly.  These goals are in turn cascaded down through the hierarchy, with each team customising their goals to align with relevant departmental goals.  The regional goal-setting process typically takes three months to roll out, as it works in a cascade process.  After team goals are written up, each individual agrees on his goals with his manager, comparing against the team goals.  These goals include functional, management and development goals that the employee needs to work on, which are aligned to their development plan.  Progress against goals is reviewed monthly with managers and performance reviews are held twice yearly.  The process for performance reviews is as follows: subordinate and customer review of performance is automatically requested using an integrated IT system.  Managers and employees receive consolidated feedback from internal customers via this system and several processes exist to consolidate external customer feedback.  Along with a self review of goals, a performance review meeting is held where the manager and employee discuss performance, in terms of progress against goals, University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 93over the preceding six months.  The employee suggests to the manager what his/her performance rating should be.  Performance is measured on a seven scale rating system with a rating of ‘1’ outlining that goals have not been met, and ‘6’ indicating that performance consistently exceeds performance requirements.  A rating of ‘7’ is given to employees that are too new in their roles to be assessed.  Table 3.3. Performance review rating description at the research organisation. Source: Replicated from the research organisation's performance management manual 6 Individual performance consistently exceeds customer/goal requirements5Individual performance generally exceeds customer/goal requirements on most occasions4Individual performance achieved, exceeding customer/goal requirements on a few occasions3 Individual 2Individual performance generally achieved, with a few occasions of partially meeting customer/goal requirements1 Individual performance does not meet customer/goal requirements7 Too new to assess/traineeSuperior PerformerGood PerformerUnder Performer  The manager does not respond with feedback on a rating immediately after meeting with the employee, but consolidates feedback after the performance review meeting which he/she takes to a calibration session which human resources runs, to ensure standards of ratings are set.  Management discusses what rating it wishes to award and needs to justify to other managers what an employee has done to deserve the rating.  After the calibration session is concluded, the manager provides written feedback to the employees about their ratings, and provides developmental feedback where necessary.  The calibration system ensures that subjectivity and favouritism are eliminated where possible.  The calibration system also works in a cascade process much like the goal-setting process.  This ensures that ratings are standardised throughout departments.  As the performance measurement system at this company is comprehensive, the researcher felt that using performance ratings was a reliable way to measure individual performance in this company.   As the survey was done between the two annual performance reviews, conducted in April and November, the researcher used both scores to conduct analysis.  As shop floor employees belong to a union and salary increases are negotiated for them centrally, they are not active participants in the performance review process.  While a similar version of the performance management process applies to them, the final rating process is less formal and University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 94 ratings are not calibrated by senior management.  For this reason, performance data for shop floor employees, who amount to 21% of workforce and 18% of the survey respondents is not available as part of this research.   3.5.2.3 Instrument 3: Semi-structured interviews A questionnaire was used as the basis for a semi-structured interview where each interviewee was asked the same questions, but, as Sociological Research Skills (2009) recommends, the researcher probed for more information in order to pick up information that had either not occurred to the interviewer or of which the interviewer had no prior knowledge.  Forty-two one-one-one interviews were conducted with employees from the research organisation.  The interview, attached as Appendix B, contained 24 open questions and had three intentions.  One was to understand what employees feel affect their perception of inclusion.  The second was to understand the respondents’ feelings about some of the inclusion variables listed in the II survey, such as acceptance, respect or fairness, and determine whether those variables related to their perception of inclusion in the company.  The third objective was to understand whether the numerous measures and components that drive inclusion, which are outlined in related literature, affected individuals’ perceptions of inclusion in a South African context.  In order for the semi-structured interview to test the findings of the InclusionIndex™ survey (the second objective above), the questionnaire was developed after preliminary analysis of the InclusionIndex™ data had been conducted.  This included the analysis of means, correlations and factor analysis.  The means were examined to determine which items related highly to the respondents’ perception of inclusion.  Correlations were examined to gain a deeper understanding of the data and understand which items were related and which were unrelated.  This gave the researcher an understanding of which items related strongly to other items and were therefore important to this research.  Finally, a factor analysis was conducted and items with high loadings were closely examined.  To develop the semi-structured interview, the researcher consolidated these findings in Excel, and listed the inclusion elements outlined by relevant researchers and determined which questions needed to be asked.  This table is discussed in chapter four.    3.5.2.4 Instrument 4: Focus groups The researcher ran six focus groups with several management teams at the research site in order to discuss with them the challenges and advantages they see for driving a diverse and inclusive workforce.  The researcher asked permission from the senior management team to University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 95hold a focus group discussion with a few of the management teams to gain their insights into the advantages and challenges around driving a diverse and inclusive environment.  Six of the senior managers agreed that the researcher could run focus groups with their teams.  The groups consisted of between 12 and 16 individuals.   3.5.3 Data collection and preparation 3.5.3.1  Instrument 1: InclusionIndex™ survey  In order to run the survey at the research organisation, the researcher negotiated with the research organisation and a consulting company called Performance Through Inclusion, who own and administer the InclusionIndex™ survey.  Each respondent was given a unique login pin by Performance Through Inclusion, which enabled the researcher to link performance data to inclusion responses.  The InclusionIndex™ surveys were completed on a secure URL owned by Performance Through Inclusion and paper copies, which were completed by shop floor employees, were sealed by the respondents and sent to Performance Through Inclusion for capturing.  The raw data from the survey was given to the researcher by Performance Through Inclusion.  The data was prepared for analysis in Excel, and incomplete responses were deleted from the database.  The researcher combined the individual responses with performance review scores in preparation for analysis for question two of this research, which was to determine whether there is a relationship between diversity and inclusion components and individual performance.  The data reflected the respondent and responses on the X-axis, and the question on the Y-axis.  There were 73 questions divided into ten factors, which the researcher labelled to make analysis easier.  For example, the questions related to ‘Senior Management’ were labelled SM1, SM2, etc., and the questions relating to immediate manager labelled IM1, IM2, etc.  Demographic data such as gender, race and religion were coded into categories (where possible ordinal categories) to optimise interpretation of data.  This enabled the researcher to identify trends easily and to average factors when variables needed to be reduced for analysis purposes.  The data was exported into SPSS along with performance review data for respondents from May and November 2007 and 2008 for further analysis.  The free text section of the survey generated 33 qualitative contributions which were exported to a separate worksheet for analysis along with the interview and focus group data. University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 96 3.5.3.2  Instrument 2: Performance data Performance management is a comprehensive process at the research organisation.  As mentioned earlier, each employee has two performance reviews per year, which conclude with a performance rating indicating how the employee’s performance fares against the performance standards of the company.  This performance rating is captured onto SAP (database and information management system), which stores information against every employee, making departmental or organisational reporting possible.  The researcher was therefore able to access performance data through this system.  3.5.3.3  Instrument 3: Interviews and focus groups  The researcher interviewed 42 employees throughout the Eastern and Western Cape.  The interviews were transcribed to prepare for coding in ATLAS ti, which is a qualitative data analysis tool.  The benefits of using software to code the data are that it allows for efficiency in handling, managing, searching and displaying data, codes and quotes; increases the quality of data management through adding rigour in the analysis; and has the convenience of data management (Flick, 2006).   ATLAS ti is able to work with various different text formats and in more recent versions can work with graphics, images and sound.  Flick (2006:351) indicates that it can be described as a ‘conceptual network builder’ or a ‘code based theory builder’.  The quotes and codes are attached to a hermeneutic unit, which contains the primary texts or, in this case, the transcribed interviews.  An additional benefit is that the program is able to ‘present codes and categories in conceptual networks’ and print or list codes on the screen through a code manager application (Flick, 2006).   Six focus groups were held with managers throughout the Eastern and Western Cape.  Two main questions were discussed: ‘What are the advantages of having a diverse and inclusive environment?’ and ‘What makes driving a diverse and inclusive environment difficult?’ – i.e. what are the challenges in driving a diverse and inclusive environment?  Participants shared their views as a discussion and the researcher recorded the discussion which, like the interview data, was coded.  The findings are discussed in more detail in chapter four.   University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 973.5.4 Data analysis The data analysis section is described in the format of the research method outlined in Figure 3.4 below. The researcher discusses the analysis and reduction of the InclusionIndex™ survey data, followed by analysis techniques used for questions one, two and three.   •Cronbach’s alpha•Measures of central tendency •Correlations•Confirmatory factor analysisBase measure of Diversity and Inclusion (using the InclusionIndex™  (II)Survey)•Qualita tive interviews•Focus groups•Qualita tive insights from the II.Model of Diversity and Inclusion• SEM (using factors from II factor analysis)•ANOVASDiversity and inclusion andperformance• SEM (using factors from II factor analysis)•ANOVASDemographics and Diversity and Inclusion Figure 3.4: Diagram outlining research methodology, highlighting the development of a base measure of inclusion Source: Author  3.5.4.1  Base Measure of diversity and inclusion 3.5.4.1.1 Validity and reliability Validity refers to the degree to which a test or other measuring device is truly measuring what it is intended to measure (Research Methods, 2004).  Cronbach’s alpha, which is a numerical coefficient of reliability (Santos, 1999) is used in this research as a measure of reliability.  Black (1999) suggests that there are numerous coefficients that can provide estimates of reliability.  In this research, Cronbach’s alpha test is used because it is appropriate for attitude questionnaires using Likert scales (Black, 1999).  Cronbach’s alpha will generally increase when the correlations between the items increase.  For this reason the coefficient is also called the ‘internal consistency’ or the ‘internal consistency reliability of the test’ (Cronbach’s alpha, 2009).  Bohrnstedt and Knoke (1988:385) write that researchers ‘strive for indices with alphas of 0.70 or higher’.  This is supported by Field (2005:668), who asserts that a value of 0.70 to 0.80 is an acceptable value for Cronbach’s alpha.  Garson (2008) says the widely accepted social science cut-off is that alpha should be 0.70 or more for a set of items to be considered a scale, but certain authors use 0.75 or 0.80, while other more lenient authors use 0.60.  Field (2005) highlights that Cronbach’s alpha should not be used as a measure of ‘uni-dimensionality’ and suggests that if several factors exist, then the University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 98 formula should be applied separately to items relating to different factors.  As there are ten factors in this research, each component was tested separately.    3.5.4.1.2 Measures of central tendency In this study, the means were used to measure the average scores of the categories of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  It provided a gauge of how employees felt about the InclusionIndex™ category.  For example, the mean score for category ‘Dialogue’ is 3.20 and for ‘Organisational Belonging’ it is 4.30.  The ‘Dialogue’ score of 3.20 allowed the researcher to gauge that overall the respondents did not perceive dialogue about diversity and inclusion to be extremely positive, and by the same token the high score on ‘Organisational Belonging’ suggested that the respondents viewed this positively.  The mean was therefore used to make sense of the data in a simple way.  Howell (1995) cautions that a disadvantage of the mean is that it is influenced by extreme scores.  This needs to be taken into account when analysing the data.  In order to ensure data was not overly skewed by outliers, the data was checked using standard deviations and variances.  Field (2005:6) defines a variance as ‘the average error between the mean and the observations made’ and the standard deviation as the ‘square root of the variance’.  In this research, the standard deviation was examined instead of the variance because it is easier to interpret how well ‘the mean represents the data’, according to Field (2005:6).   3.5.4.1.3 Descriptive statistics In order to provide the reader with a better understanding of the findings of the survey, the data was described using the mean scores converted into a percentage.  This allowed the researcher to understand which categories related positively to respondents perception of inclusion.  Correlations were used to provide insight into the actual data, not limited to the suggested findings described by the percentages above.  Correlations were used to describe the degree of strength to which one variable was linearly related to another (Willemse, 1990) and were run to understand the core element of each category.  If two elements have a strong linear relationship it suggests that they are closely linked.  If several variables showed a strong relationship (using Pearson’s r) the researcher was able to determine that they formed the core of the category.  Field (2005:741) describes Pearson’s correlation coefficient as a ‘standardised measure of the relationship between two variables’.  Black (1999) comments that this information is important because it indicates the strength of the relationship and the University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 99statistical significance, which is whether it could have happened by chance.  In this research the correlations were run on each of the categories of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  The outlying questionnaire items were identified and were checked in the factor analysis to determine whether outliers would appear there as a separate factor.   The correlations and ‘Cronbach’s alpha item if deleted test’ facilitated the understanding of the interaction between the variables in the different categories, and highlighted variables that are important for this research and those which are less important.  Understanding the outlier variables was important, as they might have formed the heart of another factor, or fallen away entirely.  The key variables from this section were used to double-check the factors from the factor analysis and were used to identify which variables should be fed into the final model of diversity and inclusion.  3.5.4.1.4 Factor analysis Factor analysis is used to uncover the latent structure (dimensions) of a set of variables.  It reduces attribute space from a larger number of variables to a smaller number of factors (Garson, 2009a).  Newsom (2005) describes factor analysis as a statistical technique that is used to determine the extent to which a group of measures share common variance.  For the InclusionIndex™ data, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was used to reduce the number of variables and to detect structure in the relationships between variables in preparation for analysis using structural equation modelling (Garson, 2009a; StatSoft, 2007).  The factor analysis and all other quantitative techniques mentioned thus far were run in SPSS.   A nine factor solution was ‘fixed’ in SPSS, as it emerged as the strongest combination of reasoning and statistics.  The factor analysis was run using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which both Newsom (2005) and Garson (2009b) suggest is the most common method for estimating factor loadings.  Garson (2009b:5) says that ‘MLE makes estimates based on maximizing the probability (likelihood) that the observed covariances are drawn from a population assumed to be the same as that reflected in the coefficient estimates.  That is, MLE picks estimates which have the greatest chance of reproducing the observed data’.  Lewis-Beck (1994a) supports this view and proposes that MLE seeks to identify the population parameters with a maximum likelihood of generating the observed values and predicted values.  This method has advantage of having unbiased minimum variance University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 100estimators as the sample size increases, having approximate normal distributions and approximate sample variances which can be used to generate confidence bounds and finally  likelihood functions which can be used to test hypotheses about models and parameters (NIST/SEMATECH Handbook, 2003).  Further to this last point, as this factor analysis was used as the foundation of the structured equation models, it was run using MLE.  In order to optimise interpretation of the data, the factor analysis was rotated using direct oblimin or oblique rotation.  Lawler (2009:3) says that ‘factor rotation involves a systematic transformation of the set of loadings, according to one of many possible mathematical criteria, to provide optimal differentiation among the factors’.  Two factor analyses were run on the InclusionIndex™ data.  The first one was on the full dataset including 248 respondents, and the second was run on a reduced dataset including 169 respondents.  Most analyses were run using Dataset 1, which is the dataset including 248 variables.  To test the relationship between inclusion and performance, the dataset was reduced to 169 because certain groups of employees did not participate in the performance management process and were hence excluded from the dataset.  This was explained in section 3.5.2.2 above.  The dataset with 169 respondents is referred to as Dataset 2.  Further, the factor analyses were run on only 59 of the variables instead of all 73 because the emotional well-being components were removed.

The demographic criteria that were tested for this research are gender, race, position in the company, sexual orientation, religion, geographic location of the site employee is based at, the department the employee works in, tenure, age and disability.  These criteria were completed as part of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  They were tested as hypotheses 2 to 11.  Two primary research techniques were used to test research questions one and two, using analysis of variance and structured equation modelling (SEM).  Structured equation models were run in order to test the research hypothesis and determine whether the model which was developed in theory is supported by the data (Dion, 2008).  Cheng (2001:650) writes that SEM is a ‘popular statistical technique to test the relationships of independent and dependent variables, in expanding the explanatory ability and statistical efficiency for parsimonious model testing with a single comprehensive method’.  Govender (2003:2) indicates that structured equation modelling is also known as simultaneous equation modelling, ‘whereby we hypothesise and test the simultaneous impact of a set of variables on another set or sets of variables’.  This methodology was employed because although other multivariate techniques are useful in determining the relationship or interaction between variables, this technique enables one to combine the variables into one model and test the relationships simultaneously.   One-way analysis of variance was used in order to check the findings of the models.  Field (2005:724) says that the ‘analysis of variances is a statistical procedure that used the F- ratio to test the overall fit of a linear model’.  Field (2005) suggests that this is done in preference to running multiple t-tests which would increase the error rate that would be incurred through running multiple tests.  Church and Waclawski (1998) assert that analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the primary statistic used for analysis of group differences and was therefore used to determine statistical variance between the groups.  All ANOVAs were run using the original categories in the InclusionIndex™ survey.  Demographic data was arranged in an ordinal fashion where necessary in order to aid the analysis process.  University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 102To test question one, the SEMs were built using co-variances of the average scores of the factors in SPSS and were run in Lisrel.  A basic SEM model (model 4.1) was used to test how strongly the factors accounted for variance in Inclusion, which was created as a latent variable.  A second SEM (model 4.2) built on the first model was used to establish the relationship between the diversity and inclusion factors and the demographic factors.  ANOVAs were run between each of these demographic factors and the InclusionIndex™ data for further insight.  These findings were used to inform hypotheses 2 to 11 which are discussed later in this chapter.   3.5.4.2.2 Question 2: What is the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance? This analysis was performed on the InclusionIndex™ data, with performance review scores added in for the individual respondents.  As shop floor workers do not participate in the performance review process, a second factor analysis was run using what the researcher called Dataset 2, which is a dataset excluding the responses of shop floor employees and new employees who don’t have performance data.  As the research was run between two performance measurement periods, both measures of performance were used.  The factor analysis was run on a sample of 168 employees with records of performance using MLE, and factors were fixed at nine to facilitate optimal model fit and consistency with the previous model.  As before, co-variances of averages of the factors were generated in SPSS, and transferred to Lisrel for analysis using structured equation modelling.   Models 4.3 and 4.4 were run on the reduced dataset including 168 respondents, and tested the relationship between diversity and inclusion and performance using performance data from 2007 and 2008 respectively.  Model 4.4 was run to test the findings of model 4.3 using the performance data from 2008.  Model 4.5 was run on the full dataset of 249 respondents and also tested the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance.  Missing performance values were replaced using linear interpolation in SPSS.  Models 4.6 and 4.7 were the final SEM models.  These models were built on previous nested models including factors that make up diversity and inclusion, the significant demographic criteria of the respondents from model 4.2 and the performance data of the respondents.  Model 4.6 tested the relationship between diversity and inclusion, performance and the significant demographic variables on the dataset including 168 respondents.

The groups for this analysis were formed using the average scores of the categories defined by the InclusionIndex™ survey.  Two one-way ANOVAs were run, the first comparing the categories with May performance, and the second, November performance with the categories.  The performance category was made up of seven levels of performance, ‘1’ indicating that performance requirements were not met and ‘6’ indicating that performance exceeded all requirements of customers.  A rating of ‘7’ is given to new employees who are too new to assess.  As with the ANOVA conducted on the demographic variables, the test was run on the original InclusionIndex™ factors or categories which is a more comprehensive version of the factors of Datasets 1 and 2.  The researcher ran the ANOVA against the entire inclusion dataset to avoid running three different sets of ANOVAs on three similar datasets and causing an enormous amount of confusion.  The similarity between the factors is illustrated in chapter four, and discussed in the findings.  As these categories formed the basis of the factors in both the datasets, they were used as the base data for analysis of variance.   3.5.4.3  Hypotheses testing .  Figure 3.6: Conceptual model illustrating research hypothesis  Source: Author  University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 104Figure 3.6 is the conceptual model which was tested and refined using numerous steps.  Kline (2005) suggests that the intention when building a SEM is to find a parsimonious model that fits the data reasonably well.  The principle of parsimony is that when there are two different models with similar explanatory power for the same data, the simpler model is preferred (Kline, 2005).  A manifest variable is an observable variable, i.e. a variable that can be measured directly.  A latent variable describes an unobservable construct, meaning it could not be measured directly (statistical glossary, 2009).  The model suggests that inclusion, which has been created as a latent variable, is accounted for by nine manifest variables, which are the nine factors emerging from the factor analysis.  Performance, which has also been created as a latent variable, is accounted for by two manifest variables – the individual performance data for May and November 2007.  H1 tests whether individual performance is affected by an individual’s perception of inclusion.  H2 to H11 test the impact of demographic variables on inclusion and possible impact on the individual’s performance.  In order to test these relationships, a number of models were run to understand each component of the model and to ensure optimal parsimony in the final model.  Models 1 to 5 were run to test different components of the final model.  This was done in order to determine significant relationships which were included in the final model.  As discussed earlier, model 4.1 tested the actual makeup of inclusion using the factors from the factor analysis.  Model 4.2 looked at the interaction between inclusion and demographic relationships.  Model 4.3 tested the relat onship between inclusion and performance using a reduced dataset and performance data for year 2007.  Model 4.4 tested the relationship between inclusion and performance using a reduced dataset using performance data for year 2008.  It was run to test the findings of model 4.3.  Model 4.5 examined the relationship between inclusion and performance, using a full dataset and performance data for 2007, which is when the survey was run.  Models 4.6 and 4.7 examined simultaneous equations including the effects of significant demographic data from model 4.2, inclusion variables on Datasets 1 and 2, and performance on Datasets 1 and 2.  Dion (2008:366) asserts that there are numerous indices used to test model fit, ‘which indicates how closely the data fit the model’ and determine whether the findings of the model are reliable and can be used.  The Chi square (2) and degrees of freedom (df) are used to determine the normed Chi Square (χ2/df), which should be as small as possible, but not higher than 3 according to Dion (2008:367).  The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is a parsimony-adjusted index in that its formula includes a built-in University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 105Model of diversity and inclusionInterviewsFocus GroupsQualitative II dataLiterature reviewII survey data•Factor analysis•Means•correlationsLiterature reviewgroupsInclusion Index (II) survey datafactor analysismcorrection for model complexity (Kline, 2005), and the value should be less than 0.05.  The Goodness of Fit, Comparative Fit index and Incremental Fit index explain the fit of the model, with values >90 indicating good model fit.  The standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) is a measure of the difference between the observed and predicted correlation and values less than 0.10 are considered favourable (Kline, 2005).  In the SEM, a line with a single arrowhead represents a hypothesised direct effect of one variable on another (Kline, 2005).  The relationship is described by path coefficients.  These path coefficients are described by parameter estimate, measurement error and T-statistic also known as wald statistic (Simon, 2002).  ‘The loading of the path coefficient is considered to be significant when the t-statistic is greater than the 1.96 cut-off for α = 0.05 or a 95% confidence level’ (Geldhof, Selig & McConnell, 2008:2).  3.5.4.4  Question 3: What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace? A key output of this section is a model of components which, when managed successfully, will result in a diverse and inclusive environment.  Qualitative research was undertaken to understand what variables employees in the research organisation felt had an impact on their perception of inclusion.    Figure 3.7: Diagram outlining the qualitative research methodology Source: Author  The intention behind this question is that when organisations understand what individuals feel affects their inclusion, it can be managed from an organisational perspective.  As this question requires engagement with individuals, a qualitative methodology was used, building on the insights established in the quantitative component of this research.  As illustrated in Figure 3.6 above, four research techniques were used to help the researcher to build a model of these components.  The first method was six focus groups which the researcher conducted University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 106at the research site.  The second was a literature review which is discussed in chapter four.  The third was semi-structured interviews, which the researcher conducted with 42 individuals and the fourth was qualitative insights from the InclusionIndex™ survey.   3.5.4.4.1 Focus groups Wisker (2001:141) says that focus groups are useful for ‘capturing people’s responses and feelings, their records of experiences …. With several people present in a focus group, ideas and issues tend to shape themselves as people speak’. Focus groups were used in this research to better understand managers’ views about the benefits and challenges of driving a diverse and inclusive environment.  The benefits the teams outlined provided insight into whether management were more focused on compliance with legislation or driven by business or moral imperatives for change.  The challenges provided the researcher with insight into elements that managers found difficult to manage.  This information provided valuable context for the model of diversity and inclusion.   The six focus groups were administered to six of the nine management teams across the research site.  The average number of participants in the workshop was 12 people.  It was not a compulsory session, but participation rates were high.  The teams were racially and gender diverse, which is driven by employment equity reporting at the various sites.  The focus group data was transcribed by the researcher and analysed using content analysis to identify key emergent themes.  Stemler (2001) outlines that content analysis is a systematic, replicable technique used to compress many words of text into fewer content categories based on explicit rules of coding.  Weber (1990) suggests that a benefit of this method is that it allows us to understand the focus of individual, group, institutional, or social attention.  The results are discussed in chapter four and the analysis can been seen in Appendix C, Tables 35 and 36.  3.5.4.4.2 Semi- structured interviews  The interview questionnaire was developed using insights from relevant literature and analysis of the InclusionIndex™ data.   The questionnaire was developed by comparing items with high means, highly correlated items and items from the factor analysis.  Table 4.7 in chapter four is a consolidation of these insights.  The researcher identified highly correlated items from the correlation analysis, items with high means and items from the factor analysis that scored above 0.5, and placed them side by side in Excel.  Where an item University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 107occurred two or three times across all three techniques, the researcher highlighted the item.  This enabled the researcher to identify which items were emerging as important from each analysis technique and across the techniques.  The researcher used this information along with the insights from the literature review to develop the questionnaire.  As highlighted earlier, the intention of the semi-structured interviews were to understand what employees felt affected their perception of inclusion, to understand the respondents’ feelings about some of the inclusion variables listed in the II survey, and to understand whether the numerous measures and components that drive inclusion, which are outlined in related literature, affected individuals’ perceptions of inclusion in a South African context.  Forty-two one-to-one interviews were conducted with employees from different backgrounds within the research organisation.  Each interviewee was interviewed according to the semi-structured interview guide attached as Appendix B.  The benefit of a semi-structured interview gave the researcher the benefit of probing for more information when necessary.  The 42 semi-structured interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and imported into Atlas ti, a qualitative analysis tool (2003-2009, version 5.0.55.) for content analysis.  Silverman (2001:123) indicates that in content analysis, ‘researchers establish a set of categories and then count the number of instances that fall into each category’.  In this research, the categories or codes were established once the researcher had read through the interviews and highlighted emerging themes or codes.  Weitzman and Miles (1995) suggest that theory builders like Atlas ti enable the researcher to associate codes or labels with chunks of text, to search these codes for patterns, and to construct classifications of codes that reflect testable models of the conceptual structure of the underlying data.  The researcher coded each of these documents into research themes such as respect, acceptance, trust and personality.  After the primary analysis, the researcher recoded each of these areas into sub codes.  For example, all quotes relating to respect were coded into quotes that:  - were general statements about respect - indicated that the respondent did not feel that there was a relationship between respect and inclusion - indicated that the respondent felt that there was a relationship between respect and inclusion.   Similarly, sub codes were developed for acceptance, trust and other variables.  The sub codes needed to be developed because, while codes can be merged, Atlas ti does not enable the analyst to separate or split codes except by recoding the data (Barry Lewis, 1998).  For the University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 108purpose of understanding which of these variables or themes related most positively to an individual’s perception of inclusion, the sub codes were tallied for each theme and then expressed as a percentage.  For example, there were 39 quotes supporting a relationship between acceptance and inclusion, and five quotes indicating no relationship between them.  Therefore, expressed as a percentage, 89% felt there was a relationship between acceptance and inclusion and 11% felt there was no relationship.  The percentages were calculated for all the themes.  With all the themes given as a percentage, the researcher could easily see which themes related most strongly to the respondents’ perception of inclusion.  This enabled the researcher to understand important themes to be included in the model of diversity and inclusion.  Silverman (2001) highlights problems with content analysis as being that it reinforces a ‘conceptual grid’ of categories and potentially does not cater for items which do not fit into any of those categories, and that categories are applied without giving consideration to potentially hidden, potentially uncharacterised views.  These problems did emerge as a challenge when addressing question 1 of the semi-structured interview, which was ‘Name three things that drive your inclusion at work and 3 things that make you feel excluded at work’.  As these elements sometimes fall outside of the ‘usual’ categories, the researcher coded these responses as general inclusion elements, and then recoded them into new categories or themes.  To gain further insight from the question 1 data, content analysis was done in Excel so emergent themes could easily be identified.  Table 34 in Appendix C is a consolidation of the themes identified in question 1.  This analysis was looked at alongside the variable percentages that emerged (Table 4.8.) to develop the model of diversity and inclusion.     3.5.4.4.3 Qualitative response of the InclusionIndex™  Thirty-three employees contributed qualitative comments as part of the InclusionIndex™ survey.  These responses were analysed using content analysis to determine key themes that emerged.  To protect the confidentiality of the respondents, the quotes are not shown, but are discussed in chapter four.   3.5.4.4.4 Towards a model of diversity and inclusion The model of diversity and inclusion was built including key items or themes identified in the quantitative and qualitative components of this research.  The basic framework of the model was influenced by Allen and Montgomery (2001), Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (2008) who propose that inclusion needs to be managed at three levels: organisational, University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 109interpersonal and personal in order to build sustainable inclusion in our organisations. ‘Otherwise, the organisation, based on the concept of homeostasis, is likely to return to its previous state’ (Allen & Montgomery, 2001:154).  This is supported by Stets and Burke (2009:34), who indicate that a theory is needed which can attend to ‘macro, meso, and micro-level social processes’.  Stets and Burke (2009:34) suggest that such a theory ‘would address agency and reflection, doing and being, behaviours and perceptions as central aspects of the self and would provide a stronger integration of the concepts of the group, the role, and the person’.  The researcher has therefore structured emerging themes related to these three levels.   3.6 INFORMED CONSENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY While employees were invited to participate in the InclusionIndex™, interviews and focus groups, it was made clear that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw their participation should they wish to do so.  The general manager sent out an invitation for employees to complete the survey and outlined that the survey was being done for research purposes, stressed its complete confidentiality and encouraged employees to complete the survey.  Despite employees being assured of the confidentiality of their responses in all communication concerning the survey and on the survey itself, they were fearful that they would be identified through their demographic status.  Several employees withdrew their commitment to participate in both the focus groups and interviews, and although all 403 employees were invited to participate in the survey, there were only 259 respondents who did so, once again illustrating that some employees were comfortable in not responding to the survey.   With regard to confidentiality clauses contained in the methodologies, the InclusionIndex™ confidentiality clause is stated at the beginning of the survey: ‘This survey is confidential and all answers will remain strictly anonymous …. You should therefore feel absolutely free to complete the survey as truthfully and openly as you can, safe in the knowledge that your responses are completely anonymous’.  Similarly, interviewees were assured of confidentiality: ‘For the purpose of my research I would like to ask you a few questions around diversity and inclusion. This information is strictly confidential (between you and me only) and will be used entirely for research purposes. The responses to your questions will be consolidated with all other responses to determine measures that affect perception of University of Cape TownChapter 3: Research Methodology 110inclusion in the workplace’.  The semi-structured interview can be seen in Appendix B.  For the focus groups, a verbal recognition of confidentiality was discussed with the group because despite the assurance of the confidentiality of the research notes, confidentiality could have been breached by anyone in the group.   After the InclusionIndex™ survey was completed, Performance Through Inclusion provided the researcher with the raw data which was analysed and used to give managers and employees some feedback on the survey results.  Detailed information such as individual or small group responses (fewer than 12 people) was not shared with the organisation for ethical reasons and to maintain the confidence of the group.  On agreement, no feedback was given to the organisation with regard to the focus groups and interviews.   Research notes were kept confidential in order to protect the individuals who participated in the research.  Further, all quotes where interviewees might be identified were removed from Appendix D.  In the reporting of findings in chapters four and five, all quotes have been kept anonymous and again, where the interviewee’s identity could be recognised, quotes have been removed.    3.7 SUMMARY The purpose of this chapter was to outline the methodology used to test the research questions. The content examined the research questions, the hypotheses, instruments, methodologies and data analysis techniques, and gave the reader some background about the research site and sample. Chapter four outlines the findings of these processes.       University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   111 CHAPTER 4: FINDINGS   In chapter four, the findings of the analysis are presented and discussed against the research questions defined for this research: 1) What is the effect of demographic variables on diversity and inclusion?  2) Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces?  3) What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa?  The format of this chapter follows the research methodology outlined in chapter three.  The findings of the InclusionIndex™ data analysis are discussed under section A.  Section B discusses the findings of questions one and two of this research, ‘What is the effect of demographic variables on diversity and inclusion?’ and ‘Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance?’, followed by a discussion of related hypotheses.  Section C outlines the analysis and findings of question three on understanding the components of diversity and inclusion.

The Cronbach’s alphas of the factors were as follows: Senior Management -0.811; Immediate Manager -0.912; Values -0.929; Recruitment -0.877; Promotion, Progression and Development -0.831; Fitting In -0.723; Bullying and Harassment -0.840; Organisational Belonging -0.896; Dialogue -0.868; and Emotional Well-being - 0.502.  As the Emotional Well-being component was less than the recommended 0.60 value, it was excluded for this study based on the possible unreliability of the data.  The Cronbach’s alpha for this factor was 0.502, which is significantly lower than internal consistency in other components of this dataset and dropped the overall consistency of the dataset when the Emotional Well-being component was included.  The Emotional Well-being component was made up of 14 emotions, to which the respondent rated a response between 1 (never) and 7 (always).  The emotions contrast each other, i.e., happy–depressed, and thus a typical result is a fairly normal distribution as someone that’s usually happy is not usually depressed.  The intent of the component in the survey is that emotional balance be calculated through subtracting distress (sum of negative emotions) from morale (sum of positive emotions).  While this component would likely add valuable insight to this research, the data was not internally consistent and hence insight derived from analysis would be unreliable.   Validity of performance review data in May and November 2007 returned a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.685.  Performance ratings for May and November 2008 returned a Cronbach alpha of 0.906.    4.2 MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY  Descriptive statistics were run across the entire dataset.  Mean scores of categories were 3.73 for ‘Senior Managers’, 3.91 for ‘Immediate Managers’, 3.67 for ‘Values’, 3.40 for ‘Recruitment’, 3.25 for ‘Promotion, Progression and Development’, 3.84 for ‘Fitting In’, 3.40 for ‘Bullying and Harassment’, 3.20 for ‘Dialogue’ and 4.30 for ‘Organisational Belonging’.  The descriptive statistics used were the mean, standard deviation and variance, and are outlined in Table 1 in Appendix C.  To illustrate the findings of the survey, the means were converted into percentages by Performance Through Inclusion.  These University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   113757873686577686486665630405060708090SeniorManagerImmediateManagersValues Recruitment Promotion Fitting In Bullying Dialogue OrgBelongingMorale Distress% scorepercentages align with the mean scores established by the researcher and are outlined in Figure 4.2.   Figure 4.2: Overall organisation scores of the InclusionIndex™ survey  Source: Performance Through Inclusion, 2007  The areas that scored highly were Organisational Belonging, Immediate Managers, Fitting-In and Senior Management.  Areas such as Recruitment, Promotion, Bullying and Harassment, and Dialogue were noted as areas where improvement is required, as these areas are negatively influencing individuals’ perception of inclusion.  This suggests that the perception of fairness in terms of equitable hiring and promotions could be improved.  Moderate scores on Bullying and Harassment suggest that employees perceive the environment to be threatening and don’t like the way people are treated in the organisation.  Moderate Dialogue scores suggest that conversations and awareness around diversity and inclusion are not sufficient.  These findings echo the findings of another cross-disciplinary organisation effectiveness survey run annually in the organisation (Organisational Effectiveness Survey, 2007).    The ‘Senior Management’ category contained questions relating broadly to the support and leadership senior management gives to leading diversity and inclusion, caring about the well-being of individuals, appreciating diverse employees, promoting diverse individuals and behaving in line with the values of the organisation.  The mean result score of this category was 75%, suggesting that employees are relatively happy with senior management at the research organisation.  The ‘Immediate Manager’ category contained questions relating to University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   114the relationship between the line manager and the individual.  Questions related to the perception of fairness, being heard, contribution being valued, dignity and being cared for as a person.  This category scored 78%, which indicates that employees are happy with their engagement with their line managers.  ‘Values’ concerned the values of the organisation, valuing of difference, employees’ relationships with the values, fairness, and working towards a common vision.  The mean score was 73%, suggesting that employees are moderately happy with values in the organisation.  ‘Recruitment’, with a mean score of 68%, examined the barriers to diversity and inclusion in recruitment practices, such as equal opportunity, and ‘who you know’ in the company.  ‘Promotion, Progression and Development’, which examined the succession of diverse individuals in the organisation, the fairness of the promotion mechanism, recognition and reward and ongoing development support, scored a mean score of 65%, which is one of the lowest scores on the survey.  ‘Fitting In’ measured the individual’s sense of fitting into their team and their acceptance in the team for their individual unassimilated contributions.  It related to inclusion of customs and traditions and different cultures.  This category scored 77%, which is one of the higher scoring categories.  ‘Bullying and Harassment’ was a gauge of how threatened employees’ felt and how people were treated in the organisation.  As this question measured exclusion, the response was adjusted to accommodate this, so the mean score of 68% reflects moderate inclusion.  The ‘Dialogue’ category explored the individual’s experience of communication, access to information and ‘support’ that diversity and inclusion issues received at the research organisation.  With a mean score of 64%, ‘Dialogue’ was the poorest scoring measure on the survey, which suggested that communication about diversity and inclusion needed to be improved.  ‘Organisational Belonging’ explored the commitment, belonging and dedication the employee had for the research organisation.  A mean score of 86% suggests that respondents perceive ‘Organisational Belonging’ positively.  The morale and distress scores noted in the graph were derived from the ‘Emotional Well-being’ category, and will, therefore, not be considered for this research.   4.3 CORRELATIONS In order to understand key components of the diversity and inclusion model, numerous methodologies were employed.  Correlations were run to determine variables with strong correlations and to determine which variables were most relevant to the survey.  The intention, therefore, was to highlight the items which represented the core of each category.  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   115As mentioned in chapter three, each question was given a unique label, for example, SM1 (senior management, question 1), SM2 (senior management, question 2) or IM1 (immediate manager, question 1) in order to simplify analysis.  As there were nine categories (Senior Management, Immediate Manager, Values, Recruitment, Promotion Progression and Development, Fitting In, Bullying and Harassment, Dialogue, Organisational and Belonging), there were nine abbreviations, and the number attached to each depended on where the question fell under the factor.   4.3.1 Senior Management The Senior Management variables were recorded as SM1 to SM7.  These variables correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlations recorded were between SM1 and SM2 (Pearson’s r=0.614), SM2 and SM3 (Pearson’s r=0.606), and SM3 and SM1 (Pearson’s r=0.543).  The lowest correlation was between variables SM2 and SM4 (Pearson’s r=0.216), with SM4 showing the lowest correlation with all other variables.  The following variables correlated with most variables and were therefore considered important to this category:  SM1- Diversity and inclusion are important to our senior managers.  SM2- Senior managers care about the well-being of employees at the research site*19. SM3- Senior managers appreciate the difference in people.  These results are shown in Table 2, Appendix C.   These findings were confirmed by checking the Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ test, which calculated internal reliability of the data through recalculating the Cronbach’s alpha when the item was deleted.  When items SM1, 2 and 3 were removed, the Cronbach’s alpha dropped lower than when any of the other items were removed, indicating that these variables were core to this category.  This can be seen in Table 3, Appendix C.  4.3.2 Immediate Managers Immediate Manager variables IM1 to IM6 correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlations were between variables IM3 and IM1 (Pearson’s r=0.752), IM4 and IM1                                                19 *The questionnaire items are stated as they appear in the InclusionIndex™ survey, but the organisation name has been hidden.  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   116(Pearson’s r=0.768), IM3 and IM4 (Pearson’s r=0.780), and IM6 and IM1 (Pearson’s r=0.729).  The lowest correlation was between variables IM2 and IM3 at Pearson’s r=0.165.  Variable IM2 (‘my manager rarely listens to what I have to say’) showed the lowest correlation with the other variables in this construct.  This was echoed in the factor analysis when this item fell into a separate factor.  These results can be seen in Table 4, Appendix C. According to these correlations, the following variables form the heart of this category:  IM1 - My manager treats me fairly. IM3 - My manager clearly values my contribution. IM4 - I am treated with dignity by my manager. IM6 - My manager cares about me as a person.  The Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test confirmed this finding.  The test indicated that when variables IM2 and IM5 were removed from the data set, the reliability of the data increased.  These variables were ‘my manager rarely listens to what I have to say’ and ‘my line manager fails to demonstrate that he/she values diversity and inclusion’.  The variables listed above therefore inform the heart of this dimension. This can be seen in Table 5, Appendix C.  4.3.3 Values The Values variables were recorded as VL1 to VL10.  These variables correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlation was between variables VL8 and VL9 with Pearson’s r=0.693.  Then followed VL8 and VL1 with Pearson’s r=0.693, VL6 and VL2 with Pearson’s r=0.682, VL9 and VL6 with Pearson’s r=0.659, VL8 and VL4 with Pearson’s r=0.661, VL9 and VL2 with Pearson’s r=0.654, VL8 and VL6 with Pearson’s r=0.649, and V9 and V1 with Pearson’s r=0.609.  The lowest correlation was between VL1 and VL7 with Pearson’s r=0.351.   VL 10 (‘the research site* treats people as individuals’) showed the lowest correlation within this construct and according to the factor analysis, did not correlate highly with any other data from this dataset.  These results are shown in Table 6, Appendix C.  The following variables were therefore seen as important to this construct:  VL1 - I can identify with the values of the research organisation.  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   117VL2 - The research organisation* values people who are different (e.g. different genders, ages, ethnic groups). VL8 - I can identify with the vision for the research organisation. VL9 - I believe that diversity contributes to the successful performance of the research organisation*.   The Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ test confirmed this finding by indicating that the Cronbach’s alpha would drop if the above variables were excluded from the data set.  It should be noted that all variables in this category show a similar pattern, with only VL7 showing an extremely marginal increase in the overall Cronbach’s alpha if the item was deleted.  This indicated that all the items are somewhat important to this construct.  These results can be seen in Table 7, Appendix C.  4.3.4 Recruitment  The variable recruitment is represented by variables RT1 to RT6.  These variables were correlated at 0.01.  Inter-correlation was generally quite low, but the highest correlations were between RT1 and RT3 with a Pearson’s r=0.562, and RT3 and RT4 with a Pearson’s r=0.542. The lowest correlation was between RT2 and RT4 with a Pearson’s r=0.201.  These results can be seen in Table 8, Appendix C.  The significant variables for this construct were:  RT3 - When recruiting, the research site* offers equal opportunities for all. RT4 - The research site* tries to recruit employees from diverse backgrounds (different genders, ages, ethnic groups).  The Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test indicated that the Cronbach’s alpha would be significantly reduced if RT3 was deleted.  Item RT4 fell in line with other items RT1, 2 and 5, and contributed moderately to the internal consistency of the data.  These results can be seen in Table 9, Appendix C.  4.3.5 Promotion, Progression and Development The “Promotion, Progression and Development” category was represented by variables PPD1 to PPD7.  These variables were correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlation was between PPD1 and PPD6 with a Pearson’s r=0.666.  The lowest correlation University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   118was between PPD3 and PPD4 with a Pearson’s r=0.148.  These results are shown in Table 10, Appendix C. The significant variables for this category were:  PPD1 - I believe the system of promotion at the research organisation* is fair.  PPD6 - There are no barriers (e.g. race, gender) to being promoted at the research site*.   This finding was confirmed by the ‘items if deleted’ reliability test, which indicated that PPD1, 5 and 6 are important items in this category.  Item PPD5 was ‘I have as equal opportunity to progress at the research organisation* as anyone else’.  These results are shown in Table 11, Appendix C.  4.3.6 Fitting In Fitting In was represented by variables FI1 to FI6.  These variables correlated at a confidence of 0.01.  The highest correlations were between FI5 and FI1 with Pearson’s r=0.588, FI1 and FI2 with a Pearson’s r=0.554; and FI4 and FI6 with a Pearson’s r=0.541.  The lowest correlation was between variables FI3 and FI4 with a Pearson’s r=0.185.  These results are shown in Table 12, Appendix C.  The significant variables for this construct were:  FI1 - I fit in well at the research organisation*.  FI2 - I have a good relationship with my colleagues. FI5 - I can be myself at the research organisation*.  The Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test indicated that all the FI variables were important to this category with the exception of FI3, which increased the internal reliability of the data when removed.  FI5 appeared to have the greatest effect on the reliability and was therefore important in this category.  These results are shown in Table 13, Appendix C.  4.3.7 Bullying and Harassment Bullying and Harassment was represented by variables BH1 to BH5.  The variables were correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlation was between BH3 and BH1 with a Pearson’s r=0.619.  The lowest correlation was between BH1 and BH4 with a correlation r=0.412.  These results can be seen in Table 14, Appendix C.  The variables seen as significant to this category are:   University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   119BH2 - I am concerned about the way some people treat others at the research organisation*. BH5 - I have felt personally bullied and/or harassed at the research organisation* in the last six months. BH3 - I have felt threatened in the workplace whilst working at the research site*.   The Cronbach’s alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test indicated that all these variables were important in this category, with BH3 and BH5 having the most influence.  These results can be seen in Table 15, Appendix C.  4.3.8 Dialogue Dialogue was represented by variables DL1 to 6.  The variables were correlated at a significance level of 0.01.  The highest correlation was between DL1 and DL2 with Pearson’s r=0.721, followed by DL5 and DL3 with Pearson’s r=0.609.  DL4 and DL1, and DL4 and DL2 followed, with a Pearson’s r=0.607 and Pearson’s r=0.604 respectively.  The lowest correlation was found between DL3 and DL6 with Pearson’s r=0.364.  These results can be seen in Table 16, Appendix C.  The following variables showed the highest inter-item correlation:  DL1 - I regularly see and hear about diversity and inclusion at the research organisation*. DL4 - People at the research organisation* are well informed about diversity and inclusion.  DL2 - At the research organisation* diversity and inclusion issues are well supported issues.   The Cronbach alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test indicated that although all the items contributed positively, items DL1 and DL4 were the most positive, with DL5 and DL6 contributing the least positive variance.  They are ‘I regularly take part in discussions concerning diversity and inclusion with my colleagues’ and ‘The subjects of diversity and inclusion appear in our communications (e.g. newsletters, company reports, emails, posters and magazines)’.   These results can be seen in Table 17, Appendix C.  4.3.9 Organisational belonging Organisational belonging was represented by variables OB1 to OB6.  These variables were highly correlated at a significance of 0.01.  The highest correlation was between OB3 and OB5 at Pearson’s r=0.738.  The lowest correlation was between OB1 and OB4 with Pearson’s r=0.465.  These results can be seen in Table 18, Appendix C.  The strongest University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   120variable in this construct appeared to be OB5: ‘Overall, I enjoy working for the research organisation*’.  The Cronbach alpha, ‘item if deleted’ reliability test indicated that all of the items contributed positively to the internal reliability of the data.  OB3, ‘I feel a sense of belonging with research organisation*’, appeared to have the highest impact on the category when deleted, which indicated that it is an important variable in this category.  Therefore both OB3 and OB5 were seen as important for this category.  These results can be seen in Table 19, Appendix C.   4.4 FACTOR ANALYSIS Two factor analyses were run using maximum likelihood estimation, direct oblimin rotation to determine which variables/items would remain when the data was reduced. These factor analyses are shown in tables 20 and 21 in Appendix C.   The main factors that emerged from both the factor analyses were: 4. individual relationship to organisational vision and values 5. individual enabled through direct line manager 6. individual sense of belonging in the research organisation 7. dialogue about diversity and inclusion 8. bullying and harassment – being accepted and respected 9. recruitment and promotion 10. representative diversity (diverse environment) 11. engagement  12. senior management.  As shown in Table 4.1, these factors are similar to the ten categories initially defined. Based on the above analysis, it is suggested that the factors that most influence an individual’s perception of inclusion were senior management, immediate management, perception of recruitment and promotion processes, perception of acceptance and respect (i.e. not being bullied and harassed), dialogue around diversity and inclusion issues, individual sense of belonging, engagement in the organisation, which enhances an employee’s perception of University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   121fitting in, and an environment where diverse people are welcomed.  These factors formed the basis of the inclusion model and the structured equation models run later in this chapter.   Table 4.1: Difference between the InclusionIndex™ factors and factor analysis factors Source: Author II Categories Factor analysis 248 Factor analysis 169 Difference between the II categories and the factors  Senior management Senior management Perception of fairness of senior management These questions focused on the importance of diversity and inclusion to senior managers, their sense of caring about employees’ well-being and their appreciation of difference in people. Immediate manager Individual acknowledged by direct line manager  Individual acknowledged by direct line manager  This factor focused on how the individual’s manager made the employee feel with respect to being treated fairly, his/her contribution being valued, being treated with dignity and being cared about as a person – essentially, the extent to which an employee feels acknowledged by his/her line manager.  Values Individual relationship to organisational vision and values  Individual relationship to organisational vision and values  This factor looked at how aligned the individual felt to the vision and values of the organisation and interestingly, whether the individual perceived that the valuing of diversity contributed to the ‘successful performance’ of the research organisation. Promotion progression and development Recruitment and promotion and development Promotion progression and development This factor encompassed both the ‘recruitment’ and ‘promotion, progression and development’ categories from the InclusionIndex™ survey. It was about the opportunity for diverse individuals to enter and progress through the company with equal opportunity.  Bullying and harassment Acceptance and respect Acceptance and respect As bullying and harassment effectively measured how excluded employees felt, the researcher reasoned that when there was an absence of being threatened, harassed or upset, the individual had the experience of being accepted and respected. Dialogue Dialogue Dialogue This factor was about the experience of diversity and inclusion that was created through discussion, information and support that diversity and inclusion received from the organisation.  Organisational belonging Individual sense of belonging in the research organisation  Individual sense of belonging in the research organisation  This factor was about the individual’s sense of enjoyment and sense of future at the organisation. This extended to feeling committed and dedicated to the organisation which resulted in an experience of belonging.  Fitting in Engagement Engagement Like ‘bullying and harassment’, this category measured exclusion. It looked at how people from disadvantaged backgrounds were supported, the way in which threatened employees experienced the culture, and whether employees felt that their managers listen to them. A culture of engagement ensured that employees felt heard, supported, and had an opportunity to express their views without being threatened.  Recruitment Representative diversity Representative diversity This factor was built using a combination of items from recruitment and senior management.

Figure 4.3 Research Methodology outlining questions one and two of this research Source: Author  These questions were tested using structured equation modelling and analysis of variance.  There are seven structured equation models which are outlined in Table 4.2, the details of which will be discussed later.   Table 4.2: Structured equation models  Source: Author Model 1 Measure of diversity and inclusion (Dataset 1) Model 2 Understanding the relationship between diversity, inclusion and the demographic factors (Dataset 1) Model 3 Relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance using performance data from May and November 2007 (Dataset 2) Model 4 Relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance using performance data from May and November 2008 (Dataset 2) Model 5 Relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance using performance data from May and November 2007 (Dataset 1 ) Model 6 Relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance including significant demographic variables (Dataset 2) Model 7 Relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance including significant demographic variables (Dataset 1)  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   123Model one examines whether inclusion, which was created as a latent variable was accounted for by the nine factors from Dataset 1. Model two builds on this model, and includes the demographic variables and manifest variables.  Model three looks at the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance on Dataset 2, which is the dataset reduced to 169 respondents.  Models four and five were used to test that relationship using performance data of another year, and using the full dataset of 248 variables.  Models six and seven test the variables which showed significant relationships in previous models on Datasets 1 and 2.  The covariance matrices of these models can be found as Figures 1-7 in Appendix C.    4.5. INCLUSION MEASURE A first iteration of the model tested whether ‘inclusion’, which was created as a latent variable, was in fact accounted for by the nine factors from Dataset 1 (Model 4.1).  This model proved to have good assessment of adequacy with 2=28.88, df of 25, Goodness of Fit 0.097, Comparative Fit Index of 1.00, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) of 0.02 and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of 0.02.  As indicated above, this suggests that the findings of the model are reliable.            Model 4.1: Basic inclusion model Source: Author   As a latent variable is accounted for by variance in attached manifest/observed variables, this model tested whether the individual’s perception of the organisation’s values, the  VL0.33IM0.61OB0.29DL0.59AR0.73PPD0.46RD0.51ENG0.85SM0.32INC 1.00Chi-Square=28.88, df=25, P-value=0.26877, RMSEA=0.0250.830.730.530.590.650.710.590.410.840.150.26 University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   124relationship the individual has with his/her immediate line managers, his/her perception of organisational belonging, dialogue about diversity and inclusion in the organisation, whether employees felt accepted and respected in their work environment, perception of promotion, progression and development, actual representation of diverse individuals in the organisation, level of individual engagement, and importance of diversity and inclusion to senior managers accounted for variance in inclusion.

The factors that appeared to have the highest influence over individuals’ perception of inclusion were senior management in the organisation, alignment between the organisation’s vision and values and the individual and the perception of promotion, progression and development in the organisation.  The factor with the lowest influence was engagement, which was made up of the items: ‘the culture does not support minority groups’, ‘I feel threatened by the culture’ and ‘my manager rarely listens to what I say’.  The model showed a covariance between ‘acceptance and respect’ and ‘immediate manager’ and between ‘acceptance and respect’ and ‘engagement’ which suggests that these items were related.  The questionnaire items which fell under ‘immediate manager’ were ‘my manager treats me fairly’, ‘my manager values my contribution’, ‘I am treated with dignity by my manager’, and lastly, ‘my manager cares about me as a person’.   University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1254.6 DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (DIVERSITY CHARACTERISTICS) AND INCLUSION To test whether the demographic variables had an effect on inclusion, a second iteration of the model was run (Model 4.2 below), using the co-variances from the nine factors listed above and the demographic factors.              Model 4.2: Investigating the relationship between inclusion and diversity characteristics Source: Author  The model proved to have a moderate assessment of adequacy with a 2=215.15, df of 108, Goodness of Fit of 0.092, Comparative Fit Index of 0.95, SMSR of 0.05 and RMSEA of 0.06.  While the path coefficients of the nine factors varied slightly from the first model, they remain significant.  Kline (2005:101) mentions that when trimming and building models, it is necessary to define a free parameter, which the program uses ‘to estimate all other model parameters while holding this path coefficient constant’.  Construct ‘Organisational Values’ was used as a free parameter in order to stabilise the model, but was indicated as having a strong influence on inclusion in Model 4.1 shown above. As in Model 4.1, the path coefficients for the inclusion variables, which are outlined in Tables 4.4 and 4.5, remained significant.

Further, individual perception of inclusion was not seen to be affected by gender, tenure, age, sexual orientation, religion and disability.    4.7 DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND PERFORMANCE  In this next section, the findings of the models examining the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance will be examined.  Table 4.6 below outlines the model fit of Models 4.3 to 4.7. All the models showed sound assessment of adequacy, with the indices falling within required ranges.  Models 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 were an exploration of the relationship between inclusion and performance.  Model 4.3 below examined the relationship between diversity and inclusion (made up by the factor scores of the nine factors from the factor analysis) and performance, which was defined by performance review scores in May and November 2007.    University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   127Table 4.6: Describing model fit of diversity and inclusion models  Source: Author  Goodness of fit Comparative fit index SRMR Chi-square (2) Degrees of freedom RMSEA Model 4.3 0.95 0.99 0.04 52.03 40 0.04 Model 4.4 0.96 1.00 0.03 42.39 40 0.01 Model 4.5 0.91 0.95 0.05 131.33 44 0.08 Model 4.6 0.94 0.99 0.04 86.63 77 0.02 Model 4.7 0.94 0.97 0.04 127.47 75 0.05  Model 4.3 shows that the inclusion factors loaded strongly onto the latent variable inclusion, suggesting that inclusion is made up of those suggested nine factors on Dataset 2.  This is not surprising, considering that Dataset 2 is a reduced version of Dataset 1, and previous models suggested that observed variables related strongly to perception of inclusion.             Model 4.3: Examining the relationship between inclusion and performance in Dataset 2 (May and November 2007) Source: Author  Variables were: ‘organisation values’ (SE=0.62; T=11.31), ‘immediate manager’ (SE=0.55; T=9.08), ‘recruitment practices in the organisation’ (SE=0.64; T=10.93), ‘dialogue around diversity and inclusion issues’ (SE=0.55; T=7.72), ‘engagement’ (SE=0.48; T=6.97), ‘fairness’ (SE=0.59; T=7.95), ‘organisational belonging’ (SE=0.49; T=9.57), ‘senior management’ (SE=0.60; T=11.07) and ‘acceptance and respect’ (SE=0.69; T=10.26).  Performance, which was constructed as the second latent variable, was made up by May and November 2007 performance.  The model showed that November performance accounted for  VL0.25IM0.39PPD0.31DL0.55ENG0.57FA0.63OB0.26RD0.27AR0.44INC PERMAY 0.25NOV 0.15Chi-Square=52.03, df=40, P-value=0.09626, RMSEA=0.0420.610.840.620.550.640.530.480.590.490.600.690.180.120.17 University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   128some variance in the individual’s perception of inclusion (SE=0.84; T=2.29), with May performance having almost no effect.  The relationship between inclusion and performance was found to be present but weak, with SE=0.18 and T=1.69.   To gain insight into the relationship between inclusion and performance, the researcher re-ran the model (Model 4.4), but used performance measures from May and November 2008.  This was done to test the findings of Model 4.3.             Model 4.4: Examining the relationship between inclusion and performance in Dataset 2 (May and November 2008) Source: Author  To compensate for missing performance scores caused by individuals that had left the organisation, the researcher used the ‘replace missing values function’ in SPSS, using linear interpolation.  The new model produced almost identical results, with latent variable inclusion showing significant relationships with the nine manifest inclusion variables.  Manifest variable November 2008 showed a weak relationship with latent variable performance, which had a weak relationship with performance (SE=0.09; T=0.88).  It is likely that the reduction in this score was attributed to the number of performance scores that were missing due to labour turnover and new employees without performance ratings, which therefore had to be replaced using linear interpolation.   In order to test whether the results of Models 4.3 and 4.4 were constrained by the size of the sample and by the makeup of inclusion when the dataset was reduced to 168 variables, the researcher replaced missing performance values using linear interpolation on Dataset 1, and ran Model 4.5.  Model 4.5 suggested that inclusion was made up of organisational values, VL0.26IM0.41PPD0.31DL0.55ENG0.58FA0.65OB0.25RD0.26AR0.44INC PERMAY 0.61NOV 0.82Chi-Square=42.39, df=40, P-value=0.36831, RMSEA=0.0190.980.660.620.540.650.530.480.590.490.600.690.090.120.17University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   129employees’ perceptions of their line manager, organisational belonging, dialogue around diversity and inclusion, acceptance and respect, perception of fairness with regard to promotion, progression and development, representative diversity, engagement and senior management.  As in Models 4.3 and 4.4, May performance was a non-contributing manifest variable, while November performance showed a significant path coefficient.             Model 4.5: Examining the relationship between inclusion and performance in Dataset 1 (May and November 2007)  Source: Author  In Model 4.5, performance was seen to be significantly affected by inclusion with SE=0.18 and T=1.98.  Although the RMSEA fit statistic was higher than the recommended 0.05 for this model, it is seen as adequate according to Hair, Anderson, Tatham and Black (1998).  They provide guidelines for interpreting the RMSEA as follows: RMSEA <0.05, good model fit; 0.05 <RMSEA <0.10, reasonable model fit; RMSEA >0.10, poor model fit.  This finding suggests that inclusion as defined in Dataset 1 had a stronger impact on performance than inclusion as defined in Dataset 2 (Models 4.1 and 4.2).  It could also suggest that the actual measure of performance (May and November 2007) is an inadequate measure of performance.  It is evident that when the relationship between manifest performance variables and the latent performance variable is stronger, the relationship between inclusion and performance increases.  It follows that if the measures of performance were weak; the relationship between inclusion and performance is not likely to be strong.  Model 4.4 was based on performance data from May and November 2008, and Model 4.5 used an expanded version of May and November 2007 data (some 80 cases were added using linear interpolation).

In the research organisation, May performance reviews were used to make decisions about salary increases and bonuses, which suggested that managers inflate individual performance scores as far as the system will allow to optimise the employee’s salary increase.  The November performance review was a better reflection of the individual’s performance, as it was used to provide guidance to the employee and it may be why it showed more of a significant relationship with inclusion than the May performance scores.  Models 4.6 and 4.7 examined a more complete picture of inclusion, when in addition to inclusion and performance, the effect of demographic variables that showed a significant relationship with inclusion in Model 4.2 were added.    4.8 DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUSION AND PERFORMANCE Model 4.6 tested the relationship between inclusion, performance and a few of the demographic variables that loaded strongly in Model 4.1 discussed earlier in this chapter.   To reduce the number of variables in the model, only the most strongly contributing inclusion variables were tested: variation in inclusion was accounted for by values of the organisation with a standard estimates (SE) of 0.62, immediate manager SE=0.54; T=8.31, promotion, progression and development with SE=0.064; T=9.74, perception of dialogue around diversity and inclusion with a SE=0.52; T=7.24, engagement SE=0.49; T=6.82, perception of fairness where SE=0.59; T=8.82, organisational belonging with SE=0.49; T=10.61, representative diversity (which is affected by senior management in the organisation) SE=0.61;T=9.97 and acceptance and respect SE=0.69; T=9.42.  Performance was accounted for by May (SE=0.61) and November 2007 (SE=0.61; T=0.83) performance scores, and demographic factors which indicated a relationship with inclusion were: position or grade in the organisation (SE=0.20; T=2.65), race (SE=0.12; T=1.79) with a direct relationship with performance (SE=0.19; T=2.72), location employee is based at (SE= -0.13; T= -2.06) with a direct relationship with performance (SE=0.14; T=2.32) and department the individual works in (SE= -0.21; T= -1.93).  The model suggested that the University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   131perception of individuals’ inclusion considering their diverse backgrounds has a significant effect on their performance with SE=0.19 and T=2.05.               Model 4.6: Examining the relationship between demographic variables, inclusion and performance in Dataset 2 Source: Author  Both race and location had a significant direct relationship with performance, in addition to their relationship with inclusion.  This meant that performance was directly influenced by an individual’s race and by the location that employees were based at.  This suggested that some managers rated individuals more or less positively based on the site they work at and that, while race influenced an individual’s perception of inclusion, it directly impacted on their performance.  Location was likely to influence performance because individual performance at many locations was influenced by how well the local operations performed, which was measured by Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s).  It might also have been influenced by the senior management at the site, whose leadership style affected the way employees were managed and rated.   Model 4.7, the final test model of inclusion, was tested on Dataset 1 (249 variables). As with the other models, Model 7 showed sound fit indices as per Table 4.6 above.  Missing performance variables were generated through linear interpolation.  The model showed similar results to Model 4.6 (Dataset 2), with a causal relationship between inclusion and performance with SE=0.21 and T=2.84.

Model 4.7: Examining the relationship between demographic variables, inclusion and performance in Dataset 1 Source: Author  This could suggest that some inclusion variables have a more visible effect on the performance relationship.  A second possibility could be the size of the dataset, but this argument was mitigated by the fact that the model falls comfortably within the requirements of the measurement indices.  Modification suggestions were made in order to improve the stability of all the models.  The following section outlines the findings of the hypothesis testing.  This was done through looking at graphs depicting means to determine trends within groups on the various categories which enabled the researcher to see patterns of responses of the groups, i.e. similarity in trends of responses.  In order to get an idea of how statistically significant the responses were, the researcher ran one-way analysis of variance on the averages of the categories and survey questions to determine which questions differentiated demographic response.

The mean values indicated that new employees and high performers experience a higher sense of fitting in than other employees.  With respect to the perception of being bullied and harassed, the results show that as performance increased, the perception of bullying decreased.  New employees and high performers had the best perception of their immediate line managers with poor performers experiencing the relationship less favourably.   The results of the ANOVA indicated significant relationships between November performance and an employee’s perception of fitting in (F=4.09; p=0.00); being bullied and harassed (F=3.44; p=0.00) and the experience of dialogue around diversity and inclusion issues (F=2.54; p=0.03).  The reasoning behind ‘fitting in’ mirrored the mean scores for the May performance, where employees with higher levels of performance as well as new employees experienced a higher sense of fitting in.  New employees and poor performers perceived a greater sense of being bullied and harassed than other groups.  With respect to dialogue around diversity and inclusion issues, the mean scores were all relatively low, with University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1350.001.002.003.004.005.00Females 3.73 3.95 3.67 3.37 3.25 3.85 3.45 3.15 4.14 3.30Males 3.73 3.91 3.67 3.40 3.25 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.14 3.31AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBaverage and above average performers scoring less than other groups in this category.  These tables (22 and 23) can be found in Appendix C.  In summary the ANOVAs showed a statistically significant relationship between inclusion categories ‘fitting in’, ‘bullying and harassment’ (acceptance and respect), perception of ‘immediate manager’ and ‘dialogue’ around diversity and inclusion issues, and individual performance. As Models 4.6 and 4.7 above both represent parsimonious simultaneous models and suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between inclusion and performance, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted.  In line with this, the H01: ‘There is no relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance in the research organisation’ was rejected, and H1: ‘There is a positive relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance in the research organisation’ was accepted.   4.9.2 Gender and perception of diversity and inclusion  Figure 4.4 contains an aggregated score for each category for the different genders.  As a means graph can give a distorted picture of the data when looked at in isolation, a one-way ANOVA was run between the demographic variables and mean scores for each category.    Figure 4.4: Comparison of mean scores by gender Source: Author  The ANOVA (Table 24 in Appendix C) found no significant relationship between gender and inclusion on the aggregated scores of the categories, which suggests that there is no relationship between gender and an individual’s perception of inclusion.  In a second survey run in the research organisation measuring organisational effectiveness, the mean scores of men and women were the same, suggesting that perception of organisational effectiveness in this organisation is equitable.  Contrary to this, the qualitative findings of this research however indicate some gender disparity, where some women were quite vocal about the presence of an ‘old boys’ club’ and complained about lack of flexibility around hours of University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1360.001.002.003.004.005.00Blacks 3.73 3.91 3.67 3.40 3.25 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.14 3.31White Eng speaking 3.81 4.00 3.75 3.40 3.32 3.87 3.50 3.18 4.18 3.33White Afrikaner 3.75 3.97 3.69 3.37 3.26 3.86 3.45 3.15 4.15 3.32Coloured 3.74 3.92 3.68 3.40 3.26 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.15 3.31Indians 3.84 4.05 3.85 3.47 3.39 3.92 3.60 3.26 4.21 3.33AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBwork.  This is somewhat mitigated by the findings of the organisational effectiveness survey where both men and women rate these factors unfavourably.   However, in the context of this research, a weak non-significant relationship was established between gender and an individual’s perception of diversity and inclusion, which leads to an acceptance of the Null Hypothesis, H02: ‘There is no relationship between gender and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’, and a rejection of H2: ‘There is a positive correlation between gender and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’.  This suggests that there is no significant difference between the way men and women feel about inclusion in the research organisation.   4.9.3 Race and perception of diversity and inclusion. Differences between race group scores appeared to be extremely marginal on the mean graph (Figure 4.5) according to these categories, but suggest that Indians felt the most included on average, followed by White English-speaking and White Afrikaans-speaking individuals.  Black individuals felt the least included, preceded only slightly by Coloured individuals.    Figure 4.5: Comparison of mean scores by race  Source: Author  Analysis of variance indicated significant relationships between the race of the employee and their perception of senior management (F=4.34; p=0.00), immediate management (F=3.12; p=0.023), perception of being valued (F=2.85; p=0.03), experience of fitting in (F=5.81; p=0.00), and perception of being bullied and harassed (F=5.33; p=0.00).  Overall, these results (Table 25 in Appendix C) suggested that race was a determinant of a few important organisational factors which related to the individual’s perception of inclusion.  More University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   137specifically, it was clear that in all instances, White and Indian employees tended to have much more positive experiences in terms of fitting into the institution, had positive relationships with senior and their immediate managers, and were less likely to feel bullied or harassed.  In contrast, Coloured and in particular African employees were likely have either experienced or perceived the converse: they viewed their relationships with their immediate and senior managers to be more problematic, were less likely to fit into the organisation and were likely to believe that they were prone to being bullied and harassed.   The post hoc comparisons of the differences between each of the racial groups within categories indicated that the differences were most pronounced and statistically significant for African employees when compared to White employees, as well as for Coloured employees when compared to White employees.  In other words, not only were Whites likely to have a more qualitatively positive experience in the company, but these differences are also quantitatively substantive.   In the Structural Equation Model (SEM), which examined the relationship between the inclusion factors and demographic components, race showed a significant relationship with inclusion with a SE =0.15 and T=2.27, which suggested that there was a relationship between race and inclusion.  Therefore, the null hypothesis H03: ‘There is no relationship between race and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ is rejected and the alternative hypothesis H3: ‘There is a positive correlation between race and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ is accepted.   4.9.4 Position and perception of diversity and inclusion.  The categories used for analysis of position were senior management, middle management, junior management, employees, and shop floor individuals.  The same categories were used for the mean graphs and for analysis of variance.  Analysis of relationship between inclusion and position suggested that employees who felt the most included were individuals at the highest grade in the region.  The graph showed that inclusion became lower on average as the grade level decreased.  The difference between senior management and middle management was where the greatest variation between scores was found.

The results (Table 26 in Appendix C) indicated that when looking at the individual’s perception of senior management, feeling valued in the organisation, perception of promotion as well as progression and development in the company; the higher the grade level of the employee, the higher  his/her perception of these inclusion measures was.  Senior and junior management experienced the highest sense of fitting in and organisational belonging.  Employees between shop floor level and junior management level and shop floor employees perceived themselves to be targets of bullying and harassment and perceived their relationship with their immediate managers to be the poorest.  This might be because managers at this level did not receive the same amount of attention and pressure as managers at a more senior level regarding their management style and deliverables.  It might also be because both shop floor and other employees were responsible for execution of strategies and tasks that were defined by their managers which, depending on the manager, could have resulted in an individual feeling disempowered.  The post hoc comparisons of the differences between groups indicated that differences were most pronounced and statistically significant when comparing shop floor individuals to other grade groupings.  Employees at this level experienced the most bullying and harassment and did not experience a sense of fitting in and organisational belonging.  Their perception of their immediate managers was poor relative to the experience of other groups, and their University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1390.001.002.003.004.005.00Heterosexual 3.73 3.91 3.67 3.40 3.25 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.14 3.31Homo/Bisexual 3.76 3.97 3.71 3.38 3.29 3.84 3.46 3.16 4.14 3.32AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBperception of being valued by the organisation was low compared to the experiences of other groups.  Shop floor employees therefore felt significantly less included than employees at other grade levels.  The SEM supported this finding and showed a significant relationship between an individual’s perception of inclusion and his/her position in the company, with a standard estimate of 0.32 and T=4.17.  The null hypothesis H04: ‘There is no relationship between position and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ is therefore rejected and H4: ‘There is a positive correlation between position and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ is accepted.   4.9.5 Sexual orientation and perception of diversity and inclusion With regard to mean scores, there seems to be an even spread of scores across the various measures.  It appears that homosexual individuals felt more included than heterosexual individuals on some measures and vice versa.    Figure 4.7: Comparison of mean scores by sexual orientation Source: Author  The analysis of variance did not support this and showed significant results between sexual orientation and organisational belonging (F=3.92; p=0.02) and senior management (F=3.65; p=0.02).  These findings can be seen in Table 27 in Appendix C.  The results suggested that heterosexual employees experienced a significantly higher sense of organisational belonging than homosexual individuals and perceived senior management more positively than homosexual individuals did.  It should be noted that the sample of homosexual employees were in the minority, but as this reflected perceived population representation in the research organisation, the researcher was comfortable in making these claims.   While the ANOVA did suggest relationships between the category ‘sexual orientation’ and senior management and organisational belonging, this relationship was restricted to these constructs because once again the SEM indicated a weak non-significant relationship University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1400.000.501.001.502.002.503.003.504.004.50Anglican 3.73 3.93 3.67 3.38 3.26 3.84 3.44 3.16 4.15 3.30Catholic 3.73 3.90 3.67 3.40 3.26 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.14 3.31Charasmatic 3.74 3.95 3.68 3.40 3.27 3.86 3.43 3.19 4.16 3.31Hindu 3.73 4.00 3.71 3.39 3.29 3.77 3.68 3.07 4.11 3.29Muslim 3.74 3.93 3.69 3.42 3.28 3.85 3.39 3.22 4.16 3.31Protestant 3.73 3.90 3.67 3.40 3.26 3.83 3.38 3.19 4.14 3.30Trad. african 3.75 3.92 3.68 3.41 3.26 3.85 3.41 3.20 4.15 3.31Chris tian 3.74 3.96 3.68 3.39 3.28 3.86 3.45 3.18 4.16 3.30Other 3.75 3.94 3.69 3.40 3.26 3.86 3.43 3.18 4.15 3.32AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBbetween sexual orientation and diversity and inclusion.  This leads to acceptance of H05: ‘There is no relationship between sexual orientation and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ and rejection of H5: ‘There is a positive correlation between sexual orientation and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’.   4.9.6 Religion and perception of diversity and inclusion The means graph comparison indicates that Hindus do not ‘fit in’ well relative to other groups, but feel the least bullied.  Religion as a diversity characteristic was tested because religion came up on three occasions as a factor that drove exclusion during the qualitative interviews the researcher ran in the research organisation.   Figure 4.8: Comparison of mean scores by religion Source: Author  Analysis of variance indicated that there was a statistical relationship between religion and fitting in (T=2.02; p=0.04).  The ANOVA can be seen in Table 28 in Appendix C.  Groups that experience a high sense of fitting in are Protestants and Christians.  Hindus and Muslim employees experienced fitting in less positively than other groups.  Post hoc comparisons of differences between groups indicated that the difference between groups is most pronounced between Hindus and Catholics and Hindus and Anglicans.  This indicated that religion does have some bearing on an employee’s perception of fitting into an organisation, but the SEM indicates that the relationship between religion and an individual’s perception of inclusion is University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1410.001.002.003.004.005.00Location 1 3.73 3.94 3.67 3.37 3.25 3.84 3.44 3.15 4.15 3.30Location 2 3.75 3.93 3.69 3.41 3.26 3.85 3.41 3.20 4.16 3.31Location 3 3.76 3.97 3.70 3.37 3.26 3.85 3.45 3.15 4.15 3.32Location 4 3.81 4.00 3.75 3.40 3.32 3.87 3.50 3.18 4.18 3.32Location 5 3.72 3.90 3.66 3.40 3.25 3.83 3.38 3.19 4.14 3.30AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBweak.  This leads to an acceptance of the null hypothesis H06: ‘There is no relationship between religion and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ and a rejection of H6: ‘There is a positive correlation between religion and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’.  4.9.7 Location and perception of diversity and inclusion The division was spread across five sites in the Eastern and Western Cape.  The researcher examined the data to determine whether there were any major differences between scores across the various sites.  The mean graphs indicated that on average the scores of the various sites mirrored one another with a few minor variations.  Figure 4.9: Comparison of mean scores by location  Source: Author  Analysis of variance of the averages of the categories and location, however, indicated significant relationships between the site that the employees worked at and their perception of feeling valued in the organisation (F=3.9; p=0.00), experience of a fair recruitment process (F=5.89; p=0.00), perception of the senior management in the organisation (F=3.37; p=0.01); and experience of being bullied and harassed (F=2.48; p=0.044).  These results can be seen in Table 29 in Appendix C.  As the sites were geographically dispersed and led by different senior managers, it is expected that inclusion would differ according to the local culture created there.  Inclusion, as measured by these variables, was perceived to be the highest at a site that was headed by a Black senior manager who worked hard on driving an inclusive environment.  The post hoc comparisons of the differences between groups indicated that the differences were most pronounced and statistically significant when comparing this site to other sites in terms of the categories listed above.  This suggested that the leadership style and perhaps even the race of the senior manager could have had some influence over the individuals’ perception of inclusion.

The mean score analysis suggested that on most measures shopfloor employees perceived inclusion similarly to employees from operations and sales.  The exception was the ‘bullying and harassment category’ and ‘immediate manager’, where the scores were noticeably lower than other groups.  Figure 4.10: Comparison of mean scores by department Source: Author  The one way analysis of variance supported this finding, but also showed significant relationships between the department an individual works in and his/her perception of senior management (F=4.36; p=0.014) and their immediate managers (F=3.23; p=0.04); his/her experience of feeling valued by the organisation (F=5.03; p=0.00); perception of the recruitment process (F=4.48; p=0.01); experience of fitting into the organisation (F=3.86; p=0.22); of being bullied and harassed (F=4.31; p=0.22); and his/her experience of organisational belonging (F=2.48; p=0.086).  These results can be seen in Table 30 in Appendix C.  Sales employees had the most positive experience in terms of these measures, followed by support staff.  Operations staff had less positive views or experiences on all categories except fitting in, where support staff felt less adapted than both groups.  This might have been because the business was centred on the sales and operations functions, University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1430.001.002.003.004.005.000-2 years 3.75 3.92 3.68 3.41 3.26 3.84 3.41 3.20 4.15 3.312.1- 4 years 3.76 3.94 3.69 3.41 3.27 3.86 3.42 3.19 4.16 3.324.1- 6 years 3.75 3.93 3.69 3.41 3.26 3.85 3.41 3.20 4.15 3.316.1- 8 years 3.75 3.96 3.69 3.37 3.27 3.85 3.44 3.15 4.15 3.318+ years 3.72 3.90 3.66 3.39 3.25 3.83 3.38 3.19 4.14 3.30AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWBwhile the support staff were there to support those groups and therefore had less of a group identity.   The post hoc comparisons between the groups indicated that the differences were most pronounced and were statistically significant for sales when compared with operations employees and in some instances for sales when compared with support staff.  There was little statistical significance between the scores of support staff and operations employees, which indicated that these groups have similar experiences relative to these categories.  These findings were supported by the discussion in the diversity and inclusion focus groups run in the organisation and was supported by the SEM with a SE= -0.014 and  T=-2.02.  In light of these findings, the null hypothesis H08: ‘There is no relationship between the department individual works in and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’ is  rejected and the alternative hypothesis H8: ‘There is a positive correlation between the department individual works in and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’ is accepted.   4.9.9 Tenure and perception of diversity and inclusion For this analysis, tenure or years of service bands were defined as 0-2 years, 2.1-4 years, 4.1-6 years, 6.1-8 years and 8+ years.  Employees with more than eight years of service appeared to be the least included group.  The other groups were similar to one another on average.    Figure 4.11: Comparison of mean scores by tenure Source: Author  Although there were no significant differences indicated in the analysis of variance (Table 30 in Appendix C) between the groups, the SEM indicated some relationship between tenure and an individual’s perception of inclusion (T= 1.87).  As the T-value is not above the recommended 1.96, there is no relationship between perception of inclusion and tenure.

The mean graph demonstrated that the scores were similar to one another (Figure 4.12).    Figure 4.12: Comparison of mean scores by age  Source: Author  One-way analysis of variance tests indicated significant relationships between the age of the individual and his/her perception of senior management (F=3.46; p=0.01), immediate management (F=5.05; p=.000), p rception of feeling valued by the organisation (F=6.09; p=0.00), view of promotion, progression and development in the organisation (F=2.99; p=0.03), experience of fitting in (F=2.92; p=0.03), and of being bullied and harassed (F=2.79; p=0.04).  These findings can be seen in Table 32 in Appendix C.  The group that felt the most positively were the 30-39 year old employees, followed by 20-29 year olds.  The group that felt the least positive were the 40-49 year old employees.  This could have been because employees in this group have fewer options to progress than younger employees, who pursue career progression actively through acquiring qualifications and focusing on their performance.  Alternatively, most employees in this category are individuals who have been operating in the operations function for many years and have little opportunity to progress outside of their area of work.  The post hoc comparisons of the differences between each of the groups indicates that the differences are most pronounced and statistically significant for employees aged 40-49 when compared to employees aged 20-University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1450.001.002.003.004.005.00Not disabled 3.73 3.91 3.67 3.40 3.25 3.84 3.40 3.20 4.14 3.31Disabled 3.75 3.92 3.67 3.40 3.26 3.87 3.34 3.19 4.17 3.30AVSM AVIM AVVL AVRT AVPPD AVFI AVBH AVDL AVOB AVEWB29, and employees aged 30-39 when compared with 40-49 year-old employees.  Employees aged 40+ were more bullied and harassed than the 20-29 year olds, and felt less positively about fitting into the organisation.  This indicated that younger employees were more likely to have a positive experience of the organisation than employees aged 40-49 and (to a lesser extent) employees aged 50+.   When looked at simultaneously, (in the SEM) there was a weak, non-significant relationship between age and inclusion.  Given that there was a strong correlation between age and many of the inclusion categories above, this finding was unexpected.  The difference might have been mitigated by the simultaneous nature of the equation, where the relationship between inclusion and age was examined simultaneously with other demographic variables.  In line with this, the null hypothesis has been accepted: ‘There is no relationship between the age of the individual and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’ and the alternate hypothesis rejected: ‘There is a positive correlation between the age of the individual and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’.  4.9.11 Disability and perception of diversity and inclusion According to the mean graph, scores for disabled individuals appeared to be on a par with scores of non-disabled individuals.    Figure 4.13: Comparison of mean scores by disability Source: Author  A one-way ANOVA test indicated a significant relationship between being disabled and one’s perception of being bullied and harassed in the organisation (F=4.09; p=0.044).  Employees without a disability experienced less bullying and harassment than disabled individuals.  This finding can be seen in Table 33 in Appendix C.

SECTION C As outlined in chapter three, to develop a model of diversity and inclusion, the researcher combined the findings of six focus groups, a literature review, 42 one-to-one semi-structured interviews and the qualitative data from the InclusionIndex™ survey.     Figure 4.14 Method used for question 3 of this research Source: Author  4.10 FOCUS GROUPS  Two questions were put to the focus groups for discussion.  The first was: ‘What are your challenges in driving a diverse and inclusive environment?’  The second was: ‘What are the benefits of driving a diverse and inclusive environment?’  Tables 35 and 36 in Appendix C outline a summary of points taken at the focus group sessions.  The first challenge that was highlighted was that diversity and inclusion were not seen as  priorities, and the pressure and stress on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) did not leave space for inclusive behaviour and time for employees to capitalise on each others' thoughts.  Second, there was a lack of understanding of different cultures and habits which prevented people from mixing across groups.  This divide was increased through cultural barriers and discomfort in socialising with people from other groups.  Focus group members highlighted University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   147that socialising did not happen after hours, which increased the divide.  Participants said that people were caught up in their beliefs, religion divides and that language was a barrier to people mixing easily, and that people were quick to judge and were caught up in discriminatory patterns.  The imperative for change was highlighted as a significant challenge, with historical issues adding significant complexity.  Participants highlighted that the topic is very sensitive to some and others indicated that they perceived that many were closed to the discussion and not prepared to move beyond the past.  Participants claimed that the issue was made more complex by arrogance, ignorance and missing self-confidence in many marginalised individuals.  There was debate around whether the country is ready to transform and whether the company was ready for the change.  Communication about diversity and inclusion was cited as a challenge because it is a sensitive topic and hence difficult to talk about.  Awareness of  the real issues was outlined as an additional challenge, with discussion of this subject being limited.  The culture of the organisation was cited as a challenge with regards to the processes and policies such as recruitment and promotion processes, the ‘sink or swim’ attitude towards new employees who are not well supported when they join the company, and the culture of the organisation, where individuals are expected to assimilate to the corporate culture.  Finally, economic challenges were raised, with the lack of progress from a socio-economic perspective being cited, and issues about xenophobia blamed for discrimination against some groups.  The group questioned whether the company knew how to address this challenge and whether they wanted to drive the transformation agenda independently of pursing compliance with equity legislation.  The benefits of diversity and inclusion were expansive and seen as the ability to understand and avoid unnecessary conflict, and the ability to understand diverse markets through diverse individuals.  Focus groups' members claimed that this was made possible through higher efficiency, a bigger customer and consumer network, an ability to expand into different markets (made possible by diverse minds), a better understanding of the market place resulting in increased competitiveness, and the possibility of opportunities which were usually blocked by barriers such as language or understanding of a specific market.  Participants suggested that a likely outcome was high performance resulting in increased profitability, market share and sales volumes.  It was suggested that these outcomes were the result of better decision-making through sharing of diverse views, and increased opportunity for problem solving and innovation.  Internal benefits included talent attraction and talent retention, which extended to a more positive internal climate where individuals could feel respected, valued and recognised.  Work life balance was considered an additional University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   148possibility, along with a free thinking, supportive environment where individuals were free of the fear of being victimised and undermined.   4.11 LITERATURE This literature was examined in chapter two, but the following sources of literature were highlighted as key sources of literature which played an important role in structuring the outline and elements of the model of diversity and inclusion.

(2008) and Louw (1995) suggest that diversity and inclusion be managed at three different levels: individual/personal, interpersonal and organisational.  Schultz et al. (2008) suggest that personal includes learning about yourself; interpersonal involves interpersonal relationships; and organisational involves the way the organisation leads the process of inclusion.    University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   149Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (2008) also suggest that the organisational infrastructure required for this process includes a diversity and inclusion plan which involves employees.  Roberson (2006) highlights that the process needs senior management support and Gasorek (2000) outlines that the organisation should create flexibility and choice.    Pless and  Maak (2004),  Mor Barak and Cherin (1998), Gasorek (2000), Avidgor et al.(2007), Roberson (2006) and Davidson and Ferdman (2002) address issues relating to interpersonal factors such as showing respect, trust, fairness, decision-making, open and honest communication, line management and feeling valued and recognised.    Louw (1995) and Schultz et al. (2008) assert that in managing the individual or personal components, individuals need to be aware of unconscious prejudice, assumptions, bias and stereotyping, which are barriers to achieving a diverse and inclusive workforce, and take responsibility for showing the right behaviour.    4.12 DEVELOPMENT OF THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW The semi-structured interview was developed by comparing items with high means, highly correlated items and items from the factor analysis as indicated in Table 4.7 below.  Items which occurred twice or three times across the three methodologies were categorised into themes.  The themes that were identified as important were: 1) that senior management care about diversity and inclusion, that they care about the well- being of staff members, and that they appreciate the difference in people; 2) that the senior management team talk about diversity and inclusion publicly, that employees are kept informed about diversity and inclusion issues, and that employees understand how diversity and inclusion can contribute to the organisation; 3) that the organisation treats people as individuals; 4) that people are treated fairly; 5) that the organisation makes provision for flexible working arrangements; 6) that individuals’ feel that they are treated well and that the culture is free of threatening behaviour; 7) that individuals are rewarded and recognised behaviour that supports diversity and inclusion; 8) that individuals enjoy the work that they do and are dedicated to the organisation; and 9) that managers treat their employees fairly and with dignity, and that the manager values the individual’s contribution.

There were two sets of important data originating from this survey.  One was whether interviewees felt the items listed in the survey related to their perception of inclusion, and if so, why.  The other was themes interviewees identified as important in driving their personal inclusion/exclusion.

Respect, trust, organisation belonging, communication, acceptance, recognition and decision-making were seen as relating highly to the individual’s perception of inclusion.  While all the themes showed a strong relationship with inclusion, empowerment, information networks and victimisation related less strongly than the other variables.  The ‘stereotypes’ measure showed the lowest percentage, because although many of the interviewees felt that there was a relationship between inclusion and stereotypes, only 47% of them experienced it personally.  A semi-structured interview respondent indicated that he had not been affected by stereotypes, but felt that this did not suggest that it was not present in his environment.  A second employee indicated that while he felt that there is a relationship between stereotypes and inclusion, he had not experienced being stereotyped, and therefore it did not affect his perception of inclusion.  A third employee said: ‘I do not let it affect me at all because I know my worth and I am here to work – and I will work’.  It appears that there are numerous standpoints on whether stereotypes impact on individual perception of inclusion.  Qualitative quotes are shared in 4.15.  Appendix C is a consolidation of the qualitative comments related to the themes.    As a second way of gathering respondents’ views of what influenced their perception of inclusion, the researcher started the interview by asking individuals for three things that University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   152made them feel included, and three things that made them feel excluded at work.  As shown in Table 34 in Appendix C, this exercise indicated that the components that most drove individual perception of inclusion was valuing or recognition of individual contribution, being valued by their managers, and their relationships and sense of belonging with their team members.  This was followed by being invited to social events, the individual’s personality/attitude, being cared for as a whole person, good communication, and organisation belonging.  Factors that drove individuals’ perceptions of exclusion were the old boys’ club, personality/attitude, organisation policy, not being invited to social events and not having empowered decision-making.    4.14 QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS FROM THE INCLUSIONINDEX™ SURVEY Qualitative comments related to the organisation or the survey.  To maintain the anonymity of the individuals, the quotes are not included as an addendum to this research, but the following research themes emerge from this component of the research.  The themes that came across most powerfully were frustration about not being heard or having opinions listened to, and the perception of not being valued.  Fairness and transparency in promotion, progression and development in the company were highlighted as being important and somewhat absent from their present environment.  Management attitude was seen as a key contributor, which extended to the way managers managed and included employees from diverse backgrounds.  The manager’s skill set, which extended to leadership style, was also deemed as important.  Recognition for work well done or recognition as being a valuable member of the team was highlighted, in addition to dialogue and transparency about issues.  This included knowing the vision of the company and how individuals aligned to that strategy.  Being aware of change initiatives and understanding their importance were highlighted as areas for development.  Bullying of certain groups of individuals, including black individuals and individuals at lower grade levels, was highlighted as an issue.  This extended to a request that individuals be treated fairly with no division or preference for any race.  Fairness around salary was raised as an issue, with new employees earning higher, more market-related salaries than existing employees.  Incompetence was highlighted as an issue which drove negative emotion, and work-life balance was highlighted as something which was not practised and which led to high stress levels.  Finally, invitations and inclusion in social functions were valued by some employees and regarded as important to University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   153them.  Some viewed the company in a positive light and complimented the organisation for driving a high performance energetic environment.   Using these data inputs and experiences, together with the insight gained by the researcher during the course of the research, a final model of inclusion was built.  Qualitative feedback from the interviews is outlined under the diversity and inclusion model.    4.15 PROPOSED MODEL OF INCLUSION A consolidation of the factor analysis from the InclusionIndex™ data and the qualitative insights from the semi structured interviews were combined and can be seen in Table 37 in Appendix C.  The following ‘themes’ were identified: representative diversity, senior management, organisation belonging, dialogue, recruitment, promotion and development, organisation climate, bullying and harassment (respect and acceptance), individual engaged through their line manager, engagement, individual relationship to organisation’s vision and values, and a personal dimension which looked at personality, locus of control, self confidence and power.  The model builds on these findings and they are discussed as the model is explained below.    Representative DiversityORGANISATION •Senior management•Organisation belonging•Dialogue•Recruitment, promotion and development•Organisation climate •Performance management (goals and measures)INTER PERSONAL•Respect and acceptance•Individual engaged through direct line manager•Dignity•Trust•Recognition•Engagement •Decision making•Access to information•Individual relationship with organisation vision and values•Personality•Locus of control•Self-confidence•Self-esteem•PowerInclusionMACRO MESO MICROPERSONAL Figure 4.16: Proposed model of diversity and inclusion  Source: Author  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   154‘Representative diversity’ is essentially related to the recruitment of individuals from diverse backgrounds, the diversity of the senior management team and diverse representation in the organisation that represent the markets it serves with respect to gender, age and ethnic group. Representative diversity was created as the foundation of the diversity and inclusion model because in order to drive a culture of inclusion, the organisation needs be representative of its operating environment.  The organisational level in this model depicts an inclusion climate, which is created through leadership and through the structure and processes of the organisation, which potentially affect an individual’s perception of inclusion.  These processes relate to the organisational climate that needs to be created through all HR processes, most specifically performance management, which relates to goals and measurement criteria, recruitment, promotion and development and the awareness of diversity and inclusion, which is created through increasing dialogue about diversity and inclusion.  The organisational climate is affected by how individuals are held against achieving diversity and inclusion.  It is important that every person takes responsibility for driving a culture of diversity and inclusion.  Employees need to be self-managed in making themselves feel included, and need to ensure that their behaviour is not preventing others from feeling included.  The importance of these individual elements is outlined by numerous academics.   ‘Interpersonal’ relates to the perception of diversity and inclusion that is created through relationships at work.  It addresses how respected and accepted individuals are made to feel and how valued and recognised by line managers people feel.  It alludes to the perception of trust and levels of engagement of the individuals about where the organisation is going.  It also relates to whether the individual perceives group processes to be inclusive and whether the individual has equal access to information through both formal and informal channels.   ‘Personal’ is about the individual’s characteristics which affect their perceptions of both their interpersonal relationships and the organisation.  It is about the individual’s personality and his/her locus of control, which is whether he/she feels he/she is being controlled, or is in control.  Confidence also forms an important part in this equation, as it affects his/her ability to ask for what he/she needs, or to hold a contrary viewpoint.  Self-esteem is a point that links closely to confidence, as it affects the individual’s belief that his/her view is valuable and is worthy of being heard.  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1554.15.1 Organisational factors 4.15.1.1 Organisational Belonging  The first organisational factor highlighted in the research was the individual's sense of belonging in the organisation.  This related to the commitment and dedication that employees had for the organisation, and the support they perceived they had.  The emergent view was that individuals need to feel a sense of belonging to their teams and to the organisation.  Based on the quantitative survey, belonging comes from a sense of commitment and dedication to the organisation, a sense of fitting in with colleagues, receiving support, being invited to social functions at work and generally feeling integrated into the company.  The following quotes from the interviews provide greater insight into organisational belonging and its relationship to inclusion:  There is a strong correlation [between organisational belonging and inclusion] because if you feel you are not in touch or you do not belong to a certain thing that might lead you to conclude you are not included and actually you are excluding yourself. You have felt you don’t belong to a certain environment. Once you start believing you truly belong to the environment, even your attitude towards your role changes completely, and yes I think that makes you more of a participatory person. There is a definite relationship between organisational belonging and inclusion, a very strong one. (male, manager)   I think a team does mean you should be working together and sharing in your successes and challenges together. I think we want to feel part of the whole, and as a team if you feel you belong to the team you feel you are adding value to that team and their value and ultimate successes. Then you would feel more included. (female, day employee)  4.15.1.2 Dialogue  A second factor was dialogue around diversity and inclusion issues which included discussions, campaigning, and the general internal awareness of diversity and inclusion.  In the focus groups a few individuals claimed that the subject of diversity and inclusion was difficult to discuss because there is significant sensitivity around this subject in South Africa.  It became apparent that this lack of dialogue was causing a lack of understanding for a range of other issues which remained unresolved and were a source of tension in the workplace.  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   156Dialogue also extends to the general role of communication and whether employees have access to the information they need in order to do their jobs.  In the organisation it is apparent from the qualitative feedback that information networks are healthy and most people have full access to all the information they need to do their jobs.    I think there is sufficient communication. My manager sends us information and is good at keeping us informed. This is the same with other members of the team; they send messages to the whole team which keeps us all informed all the time. So I think this increases levels of inclusion. (female, manager)  Communication does play a massive role in whether you feel included or excluded. Also in terms of the language used. Colloquialisms used. Just generally what we speak about. (male, day employee)  Ja, if we don’t have communication that feeling or forming part, that oneness or togetherness would lack if we were not speaking to each other. It does affect inclusion. (female, manager)  Communication in the team is generally very good and again it feeds directly into inclusion for me. It’s gaining access to information. We are fortunate to have access to a lot of information and it is almost like that information empowers me to make more decisions and more important decisions for the business which makes me feel more included. (female, manager)  4.15.1.3 Recruitment, Promotion and Development This factor relates to barriers to entry for ‘previously disadvantaged’ individuals, equal opportunity to enter and progress through the organisation, the fairness of the promotion process, and the fairness of the recruitment process, where candidates are considered for the contribution they would not make, and are not discriminated against for not meeting a general recruitment  profile.  In the qualitative component of the research, individuals rated having an active development plan as important to their perception of inclusion.   I actually felt excluded now that you ask me [at the lack of development]. I don’t know if I would have thought about it like that at the time. I felt no one really cares, if University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   157they wanted a clerk why didn’t they just say so. Seriously, I thought this whole graduate-in-training programme is sold to you so nicely, this is what we are going to do, we are going to train you, we want a new generation of leaders and then they put  you behind a desk with paper.  [In this example, the employee was speaking of an experience at her previous company, not the research company.] (female, manager)   So the fact that I am, that my development that it is growing just in terms of, it impacts on my, you know like that, commitment or wanting to do more or go to the next level which is growth and it is also commitment. Engagement, commitment. Which obviously makes me feel included. (female, manager)   4.15.1.4 Senior Management  The third organisational factor highlighted in the research was senior management.  Items included showing that senior management cared about the well-being of employees, that diversity and inclusion was important to the company, that they appreciated the difference in people, and that they treated people fairly.  In the semi-structured interviews it emerged that fairness was an essential trait in senior management when driving a diverse and inclusive environment.    Style of management has a huge impact on the feeling of inclusion or exclusion. There has been a marked different in climate in this site from the time I left to the time I came back and has been a result of the type of management style being exercised now. Like John,* he is a great guy but he is very autocratic in his approach. But autocratic in a shouting way, one can be autocratic and be nice about it, look I would like you to do this, this is how I want it done and do it by this date. But the way he has gone about it is do it and don’t ask any questions. So I think yes the people who aren’t performing are feeling the pressure but it is also puts a whole new flavour to the district. People are afraid to speak. At management meetings if you speak out of turn you get a fine. I have never heard anything such crap in my life. I asked what do you mean; no you get a R20 fine if you ask a stupid question. So does that mean while I talk everyone else must be quiet - that sucks. We must engage with one another not just sit there. That is the way he chooses to manage. There is a fair amount of … I think Peter* is exactly the same, there are individuals who have lots of potential and we are crushing it by the way we manage and we are excluding them. University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   158These people are waiting to run, that is all they want to do. The other side of it is the trust issues where we are typically a high trust organisation I think when the style of management changes the trust goes (female, management).  4.15.1.5 Organisation Climate This factor examines the systems and processes in place, which enable a diverse and inclusive environment.  These include a comprehensive performance management system, inclusive recruitment practices, policies, flexible working arrangements, a mentoring program, or could even be as simple as ensuring employees from all backgrounds are included in social events.   We have very nice processes in terms of performance management. It is brilliant if it’s used right…. There is one guy that if he says 20 words then he is chatty. I can dictate his performance rating to him. Since we’ve had monthly meetings with him, he has completely opened up, he’s blossomed. He’s come up with ideas that we have put into practice in the warehouse. He’s this man, 25 years of experience…How do you create an environment where he feels he wants to share and contribute… if performance management is used properly then that is a dynamic tool. It is a tool that grows things. (male, junior manager)  The social systems we have in place now, team meeting outside of work where we are not allowed to talk about work once a week. That definitely works and makes you feel included. (male, manager)  They have an employee forum. I have never been involved in it. I think we go a long way into taking people’s opinions into consideration. I think management here, they do walk around, they do chat to individuals. The senior manager is going through an awesome programme at the moment which is quite an undertaking. I think he is going a long way to make people feel important, to make people feel that their opinions are heard. I think a lot of the time it is nice to have opinions and feelings but in an organisation you have to make the best financial sound decision. (female, manager)   University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1594.15.2 Interpersonal factors Louw (1995) asserts that driving inclusion at the interpersonal levels involves facilitating communication between different individuals and respecting differences, encouraging participation and sharing perspectives, valuing and respecting differences and accepting mutual responsibility for developing common ground.  This research supports the finding that valuing and respecting individuals is important, but adds that the relationship between the line manager and subordinate, acceptance of individuality, engagement and the individual’s alignment with the organisation's vision and values are of importance to this component.     4.15.2.1 Line manager ‘Individual engaged through direct line manager’ was one of the highest scoring components in the factor analysis and was also a key component highlighted in the semi-structured questionnaire.  It encompassed outputs related to an inclusive relationship between manager and employee.  These outputs were: ‘My manager values my contribution’, ‘I am treated with dignity by my manager’, ‘I am treated as a person by my manager’ and ‘I am treated fairly by my manager’.  From a qualitative perspective, variables that aligned to this theme were empowerment, recognition and trust.   I can because I can split it up into two things, I can say yes and no [influence on perception of inclusion]. It depends on the manager I had at the time; it wasn’t valued because of his management style. Now it is valued because, it is actually because of the management style and the person. That came back to your previous question, senior managers, the management style is of a certain nature, you can feel excluded, you change managers and you will find that the same position, the same work you were doing was cherished. So it depends on the line manager. (male, day employee)  I think my relationship with my line manager and the team are the two things that make me feel most included. (female, manager)  I think it is very important. Trust is earned. A lot of people just expect you to trust them. I think if you trust the people and you know the people trust you, you will feel a University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   160lot more included and part of that team. That relationship will be much better. Trust is important. (female, manager)  Definitely [the level of trust impacts on your level of inclusion]. And it is not purely work related. People open up to you, speak more frankly to you, honestly, they give you more transparent or genuine feedback other than the diplomatic answer. (male, day employee)   I think if you respect people’s views, or they think you respect their views, or you listen to their views then they feel more included and they give better. If my view is respected and even in a conflict situation my view is acknowledged then I feel included in that group. (male, day employee)  4.15.2.2 Respect The second factor which came up as important in both the factor analysis and the qualitative questionnaire was an environment absent of bullying and harassment, where individuals are treated with respect.  In the semi-structured interview, respect came up as one of the most important drivers of diversity and inclusion, followed closely by acceptance.  Some individuals rated the misuse of positional power as driving their exclusion, but some indicated that not having enough power within their own roles affected their perception of inclusion.  While many individuals had not been the direct recipients of stereotyping, it did affect their general perception of inclusion.  Maybe there is an opportunity to think about what we can do to make everyone feel included. Not so much about an intervention but giving that individual what they need on a day-to-day basis. That is quite clear to me just from the survey and from the interviews I have done, so it is about each individual, person by person and what you can do to make them each feel included. Sometimes about things, every single person says it is about respect and dignity, about fairness, about my manager listening to me and caring about me as a person. Those are the key things. If you can create a culture where those things are enabled we will have more inclusion. (male, manager)   University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   161Definitely, there’s a relationship [between respect and inclusion] for myself yes. If I wasn’t respected then I wouldn’t be included as much by so much people. I think people must have a certain respect. It depends where the respect comes from. Some comes from knowledge of a subject, some people respect you because of your high integrity and some people look up to that but I would think they are directly related. (male, manager)  4.15.2.3 Acceptance  While acceptance is a sub-component of the previous point, it was considered very important in the qualitative component of this research so the points have been separated.  In this context, ‘acceptance’ involves an appreciation or acknowledgement of individuality and/or regard for who you are as a person.    [Inclusion plays] a big part because we often don’t want to be someone else and we can only pretend for so long and being accepted for oneself makes you feel comfortable, you are allowed to be who you are, same as regards respect. Don’t feel that you have to change or pretend to be someone else. (female, day employee)  Well it is very important to be accepted to be as you are in order to feel included. I think you are who you are and what you bring to the table is unique in its own right and it ultimately has to fit into the equation at some point in time. (male, day employee)  4.15.2.4 Engagement  A culture of engagement was the third interpersonal factor and related to whether the organisation created a culture where people from disadvantaged backgrounds were welcomed, and whether individuals felt that their contributions were heard.  Interviewees indicated that sufficient decision-making impacted significantly on their individual perceptions of inclusion.   I do think the level of engagement with my manager increases my level of feeling included in the company. (female, manager)  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   162I am very engaged and I think your engagement will tie in with your inclusion. It does. If you are committed, it all ties into everything, if you want to be committed, do the extra hours, you will feel included in everything. (male, manager)   My levels of engagement with my manager are incredibly high, which has a positive effect on my inclusion. From my experience, when I was in another department I had a terrible relationship with my line manager and in terms of inclusion had the opposite effect to the way I feel now with my current line manager. (female, manager)   I don’t know if it was their personalities or what. I felt in relation to them excluded because I didn’t have that engaged relationship with him. (female, manager)    4.15.2.5 Organisational Vision and Values Individual relationship to ‘organisational vision and values’ was the last interpersonal factor and relates not just to the presence of vision and values in th  organisation, but also to the individual’s awareness and alignment to them.  This is usually done through clear individual goals which demonstrate alignment to a bigger picture.  This element has been included in this section because it is not just the presence of an organisation’s vision and values that affects an individual’s perception of inclusion, but their interaction and relationship with it.   Yes [it positively affects my perception of inclusion], because your goals give you direction, give you value, give you a sense of purpose. (male, day employee)  [To feel more included, I need] more feedback on what the direction the business is taking and more around the transparency around feedback in what the business is going for, its objectives, what is my role within the business, going forward. (male, manager)  Yes, you know we are all going trying to achieve common business goals and you want to work in an environment where everyone is respected for their views. We don’t all necessarily have to share the same views. (female, day employee)   University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   1634.15.3 Personal component The importance of this component was emphasised most strongly during the qualitative component of the research, when it became apparent that responses varied most according to who the respondents were and what they needed as individuals, before looking at who they were as employees, and what they needed to feel included at work.  This component included personality, locus of control, self-confidence, self-esteem and power.   4.15.3.1 Personality  This is made up of the characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviours that make a person unique.  Personality is one of the main factors that differentiate an individual’s needs and response within an organisation.  Personality affects an individual’s needs in terms of inclusion, (some employees need to feel more included than others) and potentially their perception of their own inclusion in the organisation.   It relates to personality and you as a person what do you want to achieve. To me if you have the right personality you fit in well into a team. If you know where you want to go you also fit in well into it. (male, manager)  Other people accept me for who I am. Call a spade a spade, in some places it probably doesn’t go down very well. I am very much what you see is what you get. Within our team we know each other well enough now that if I say something I am not trying to be malicious, I am just very straightforward. That is me. I don’t believe in beating around the bush. Liked or not liked. Within the team it is fine. (female, manager)  It also depends on your personality type so because I look at my staff and there are a lot of things that would make them feel excluded but then it does depend on their personality, then the other ‘okes’, some of them are more extrovert, they go out and don’t care if someone didn’t talk to them whereas other people would stand in the corner. (female, manager)  With certain things you feel excluded with things happen at regional office which you are not included in there or here. Actually [I] don’t mind that. For me that works  from a personal experience. I like to have work and I like my life. For others it is a University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   164problem... It suits my needs because I am beyond partying every night. (female, manager)  4.15.3.2 Locus of control Locus of control is outlined by Firth et al (2003:172) as ‘the extent to which people believe they or external factors, such as chance and powerful others, are in control of the events that influence their lives’.  It became apparent during the semi-structured interviews that while some individuals placed a high value on the organisation doing things to ensure they were included, others felt that it was their responsibility to make themselves feel included.   It is a definite barrier if the relationship is not to the extent you want it to be where you can be open and transparent in all ways and have that open relationship with your manager. So then you exclude yourself because of your own reasons, you would exclude yourself. (male, day employee)  I suppose my personality has never allowed, has been such that I make people include me because I always believe what you allow you teach so I don’t allow people not to include me so I think I always feel included and if I didn’t I would go out of my way to make sure I was because I have that sort of personality. (female, manager)   You can either stand around and whine about it and that is not me or you can do what you have to do to actually change things and that is me, or you can leave. (female, manager)  I am probably one of those strange individuals that would say very much of what happens to us we bring about ourselves so I don’t know. (female, manager)   4.15.3.3 Self-Confidence Be´nabou and Tirole (2002) state that individuals who are driven by high self-confidence respond to situations with ‘can do’ optimism in economic and social interactions and that they have a higher motivation to act.    University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   165Top thing [that drives exclusion] would be lack of self-confidence sometimes. Pre-build perception, which would be not thinking that I should be interacting with people at a certain grade, but this is a people perception from my side. There are definite structures of hierarchy, and you cannot go and tap the MD on his shoulder… I think that most of the stuff that excludes you the most is one’s own view and opinion and your ability to overcome that. (male, day employee)   I am able to speak to my line managers fairly frankly and openly. I am able to communicate with them all on the level. And obviously that very fact helps that you are included. That you don’t need to hide certain things, or you are not asked things from an inclusion point of few. It helps a lot that I did that because I feel included. The confidence to say that this is not the right thing. (male, day employee)   I don’t know, to me I believe in a couple of things. I believe that people say if you come into organisations and you are forced to assimilate information, you are not forced to do anything we are not forced to do anything. You need to know who you are, what your values are, where you draw the line and you need to engage people when things are over that line. (female, manager)  4.15.3.4 Self-Esteem Mruk (2006:3) says that whether the ‘self esteem has to do with an abiding sense of worthiness as a person or the experience of trying to solve problems competently, or both, self esteem is intensely personal, in part because it says something about who we are and how we live our lives’.  Leary, Schreindorfer and Haupt (1995) indicate that self-esteem is regarded as a psychological gauge, or sociometer, an indicator that allows people to monitor inclusion or exclusion reactions towards them from their environment.  In this context, self-esteem relates to a sense of ‘I deserve to be treated well’ or ‘I am worthy of equal treatment’.  It has been differentiated from confidence because self-esteem need not have an external manifestation; it simply affects the individual’s response to his/her environment, which affects his/her perception of inclusion.   It doesn’t really impact on it in that I am self assured. I don’t really bother too much about what others are thinking. (female, day employee)  University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   166I am sure I have said this before, one of my mottos in life is your only obligation in your life is to be true to yourself, and another one is you can’t please everyone so you have to please yourself. And where I feel excluded I just go on as long as I am being true to myself. (female, day employee)  4.15.3.5 Power Power relates to use and misuse of authority. From an inclusion perspective, misuse of power means less engagement, less empowerment in terms of decision-making and other practices which lead to individuals feeling devalued. Kleiner (2004:3) says, ‘the most effective teams seem to be those that have instilled a culture where terrorizing, predatory behaviours are minimal; where people find it easy to learn what others are thinking and to care about understanding them’.  Power is useful when it is used to give guidance and build the confidence of individuals.   I think it is mostly in decision-making. Also certain people are not necessarily approachable and people are scared of them because of 1) their positions and 2) because of their positions and their personalities. People will just kind of sit and not talk to them. (female, day employee)   If you do things with your own thinking, you feel like you want to come to work again tomorrow because you know you have some powers. If you don’t have any powers to make decision then you won’t feel like you are being included, you are just here. (male, manager)  Shout at people and hang out my window, swear at people then you as the person wielding that power will be excluded from the group. The group doesn’t want you. No one wants Hitler despite the number of views he had. (male, day employee)  The model of diversity inclusion is critical in understanding how inclusion should be managed and built in organisations.  Its main use in practice will be to provide a comprehensive insight into what factors need to be managed in order to create an inclusive culture in a multicultural organisation.  It should be made clear that this model is not a stand alone tool because it does not incorporate the valuable management aids or tools outlined in some of the more comprehensive models in chapter two. It is to be used to guide University of Cape TownChapter 4: Findings   167considerations or outcomes organisations should consider when driving an inclusive environment in the diverse organisations.   4.16 SUMMARY In this chapter the findings of the research questions were discussed.  The first research question examined the relationship between perception of inclusion and race, gender, age, tenure, sexual orientation, physical ability, position/grade in the company, location and department. Race, position, location and department were the only variables which showed a significant relationship with inclusion.  The questions related to understanding the relationship between inclusion and performance.  Overall, a relationship between diversity and inclusion and individual performance was established, which was seen to be most strongly affected by factors such as the individual’s relationship with his/her immediate line manger, the individual’s perception of fairness, senior management’s leadership with respect to diversity and inclusion, which extended to representative diversity in the organisation.  The third question of this research related to understanding which components needed to be managed in order to create a diverse and inclusive environment.  The following ‘themes’ were identified: representative diversity, senior management, organisation belonging, dialogue, recruitment, promotion and development, organisation climate, bullying and harassment (respect and acceptance), individual engaged through their line manager, engagement, individual relationship to organisation’s vision and values, and a personal dimension which looked at personality, locus of control, self confidence and power.

In chapter four, findings were outlined in detail.  In this chapter, key findings are outlined against the research questions and corroborated against other research in the area.    To answer questions one and two, a combination of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and structured equation modelling was used to test 11 hypotheses which are outlined in Figure 5.1 below.   Figure 5.1 Conceptual model outlining research hypotheses Source: Author  To do this, a base measure of inclusion was established.  Senior management’s attitude and leadership around diversity and inclusion issues were seen as having the most influence over an individual’s perception of inclusion, followed by the individual’s alignment to the organisation's vision and values.  Fairness around recruitment, promotion and development in the organisation, perception of belonging in the organisation, immediate manager engaging individuals, representative diversity, dialogue, acceptance and respect and University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  170engagement were other variables all seen as having a significant influence over an individual’s perception of inclusion.  5.1 QUESTION 1: WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION? Using structured equation modelling and analysis of variance (ANOVAs), ten hypotheses were tested for this question.  The following section examines the findings of this research and compares them to the scant research that is available surrounding the relationship between diversity characteristics and variables such as performance, innovation and team behaviour in order to establish the trends of existing findings.  While this question relates specifically to the relationship between demographic characteristics and diversity and inclusion, there are very few studies that have examined this relationship (Pelled et al., 1999b; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Findler, Wind & Mor Barak, 2001; Mor Barak & Levin, 2002).  Comparison with these studies should be approached with caution considering the differing measures of inclusion and further, the relationships between the diversity characteristics and inclusion are not considered parsimoniously in these studies.  To provide some grounds for comparison, relevant research examining the relationship between diversity characteristics and numerous variables such as performance and innovation have been examined. Jackson, Joshi and Erhardt (2003:805) highlight that a constraint of ‘most of the arguments offered to explain the effects of readily detected attribute diversity assume that readily-detected attributes are associated with underlying attributes, which in turn, drive behavior’.   5.1.1 Gender The analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no relationship between gender and perception of inclusion on any of the diversity and inclusion factors, and structured equation model (SEM) found a non-significant relationship between gender and inclusion when looked at simultaneously with other listed demographic variables.  This finding suggests that gender does not influence individual perception of inclusion.    However, research on gender and individual perception of inclusion, consistently found that women perceive inclusion less positively than men (Mor Barak & Levin, 2002; Mor Barak et al., 2001; Pelled et al., 1999).  Mathur-Helm (2004) supports this finding in her research and claims that women are still regarded as secondary to men in South African business culture, University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  171and accept secondary roles without hesitation.  April et al. (2007:61) say that ‘executive careers are only available to the few woman that are resilient, are willing to work extreme hours, are willing to develop appropriate informal connectedness, and who really want an executive career, albeit at a price’. Riach and Rich’s (2002) research focused on the interaction between gender and other variables and they note that amongst applications for a job, men are more twice more likely to be selected than females.  These studies suggest that the work playing field is not an equitable environment and makes the finding that there is no relationship between gender and perception of inclusion difficult to reconcile.  As both the SEM and the analysis of variance showed non-significant results on all of the inclusion factors, and there is little empirical evidence to suggest the contrary, the acceptance of the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between gender and individual perception of inclusion stands.  5.1.2 Race Analysis of variance indicated significant relationships between the race of the employee and their perception of senior management, immediate management, perception of being valued, experience of fitting in, and perception of being bullied and harassed.  The post hoc tests indicated that White and Indian employees perceived inclusion more positively than Black and Coloured employees.  The structured equation model showed a relationship between race and individual perception of inclusion, which led the researcher to accept the alternative hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between race and diversity and inclusion in the organisation.  This finding was supported by the findings of the semi structured interviews:  there [have] been situations where there are serious racial challenges between myself, my boss and Mark*. To an extent that you see in his interactions, for instance you tend to conclude that there is a belief that [a] certain race is more inferior than a certain race…. honestly I truly believe this organisation is for white males. (Black manager)  I enjoy the fact that I am dealing with professional people of all race groups. I grew up in a very white dominated culture where everyone I interacted with in another race group was subordinate to me whether it was the gardener, char, postman, that was my experience of people who were not white. So I actually value enormously working with professionals who are not white because it helps to change my mindset which is very racist. My default position is racist because all my formative years had a racist tone. So that impacts on my view of inclusion, another huge value for me that we have a mixture and I am just one of the differences. I feel included because I am different and everyone else is different. (White manager)   University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  172These findings are supported by research conducted by Mor Barak and Levin (2002), Mor Barak (2000a), Ibarra (1995) and Greenhaus et al. (1990).  They are also supported by research by Riach and Rich (2002:36), whose ‘field experiments of discrimination in the market place have extended across 10 countries, several markets and 35 years’, indicate that there is ‘demonstrated pervasive and enduring discrimination against non-whites’.  Richard (2000) found that race is positively associated with companies pursing a growth strategy, but was associated with lower productivity in companies that were downsizing or companies that failed to have a clear strategy.  Jackson and Joshi (2004) found that team performance was the lowest when there was a combination of high tenure, high gender and high ethnic diversity, suggesting not only that dissimilarity with regard to race negatively affects team performance, but adds to the extensive literature that heterogeneous teams affect team performance less positively than homogenous teams.  The findings of these studies are in support of the findings of this research that Black, Coloured and Indian individuals in the workplace perceive diversity and inclusion less positively than White individuals.   5.1.3 Position  Analysis of variance showed that position or grade in the company has a statistically significant effect on the perception of feeling valued in the organisation, immediate management, senior management, perception of equitable promotion, progression and development, experience of fitting in, being bullied and harassed and the perception of organisational belonging.  The Structured Equation Model supported the finding on the analysis of variance and showed a significant relationship between an individual’s perception of inclusion and his position in the company, so the alternative hypothesis, ‘there is a positive correlation between position and diversity and inclusion in the research organisation’ is accepted.  There were unfortunately no comparable results on this diversity dimension with other research.    5.1.4 Sexual orientation Analysis of variance showed significant results between sexual orientation, organisational belonging and senior management.  These results suggest that heterosexual employees experience a significantly higher sense of organisational belonging than homosexual individuals and perceive senior management more positively than homosexual individuals.  The SEM indicated a weak non-significant relationship between sexual orientation and University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  173diversity and inclusion.  This led to acceptance of the null hypothesis, ‘there is no relationship between sexual orientation and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’.    It was mentioned in a focus group that the groups that are under the most pressure to assimilate in the organisation are gay, lesbian and bisexual employees.  Not only are these employees in the extreme minority, but the strong male dominated culture does not welcome individuals from this group.  This is reflected in population sample, which is less than 1% of the overall sample in a society where gay individuals make up approximately 10% of the population (Anonymous, 2007b).  There is no research on the relationship between sexual orientation and inclusion in order to corroborate or challenge the findings of this research.    5.1.5 Religion Analysis of variance suggested that there is a statistical relationship between religion and fitting in, with Protestants and Christians experiencing fitting in more positively than Hindus and Muslim employees.  This indicates that religion does have some bearing on an employee’s perception of fitting into an organisation, but the SEM indicates that the relationship between religion and an individual’s perception of inclusion is weak.   There appears to be some interest for further research about the relationship between religion and diversity (Jackson, Joshi & Erhardt, 2003; Mor Barak & Levin, 2002; Stuber, 2005a).   Stuber (2005a) says that religious diversity is increasing, and Mor Barak and Levin (2002) suggest that an expansion of our notions of diversity be tested to include characteristics such as religion, age, physical ability and accent.   Religion on three separate occasions in the semi-structured interviews was a factor which drove individual perception of exclusion.   Religiously I feel excluded. I have very strong views about some things. There are certain days that I hold very dear. Those days are not necessarily respected by the company. Being forced to work on those days doesn’t make you feel respected. I feel for the Muslims that are in our group. They take a lot of abuse from their communities in terms of who they work for and their religious days are not considered so I feel excluded on their behalf man. They have to put in a day’s leave (Muslims on their religious occasions). They have to do extra to be in the company. (male, junior manager)  University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  174No research investigating the relationship between religion and inclusion was found, but on the basis of the findings of this research the null hypothesis is accepted: H06: ‘There is no relationship between religion and diversity and inclusion in the organisation.’   5.1.6 Geographic location Analysis of variance of the averages of the categories indicated significant relationships between the site that the employees work at and their perception of feeling valued in the organisation, their experience of a fair recruitment process, perception of the senior management in the organisation, and experience of being bullied and harassed.  SEM and analysis of variance show a significant relationship between the location an employee is based at and individual perception of inclusion.   I have a cool relationship with the new senior manager*, I get along with him. I feel really comfortable with him. If I compare him to the old senior manager* I would never just walk into his office. Now I just… pop in and chat.  It is cool because I would never do that with the old senior manager, I was scared to death of him. (male, junior manager)  Style of management has a huge impact on the feeling of inclusion or exclusion. There has been a market different in climate … from the time I left to the time I came back (maternity leave) and has been a result of the type of management style being exercised now. (female, manager)  No research relating to location and diversity outputs/inclusion was found, but the alternative hypothesis ‘there is a positive correlation between geographic location and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’ was accepted on the basis of the findings of this research.   5.1.7 Department One way analysis of variance showed significant relationships between the department an individual works in and his/her perception of senior management, immediate managers, his/her experience of feeling valued by the organisation, perception of the recruitment process, experience of fitting into the organisation, of being bullied and harassed, and his/her experience of organisational belonging.  The SEM indicated a positive relationship between department and individual perception of inclusion which leads to an acceptance of the alternative hypothesis that H8: ‘There is a positive correlation between the department individual works in and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’.  Feedback from the semi structured interviews: University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  175We the people work on the floor we don’t get recognised by the company, it is only the managers recognised. (male, shopfloor employee)     People in admin (not in operations), they may say it is a perception, but I think they have a higher perception of themselves. Because it is white collar work they kind of make you feel not welcome in their space. That’s what makes me feel excluded. (male, shopfloor employee)  Pearce and Randell (2004) found that employees with low mobility are likely to experience low social inclusion.  This is consistent with the findings of the post hoc tests which suggested that employees in operations, who are typically were employed at the same site in the same job for anything between 15- 40 years, perceive inclusion less positively than sales employees, who change jobs more frequently.  This finding is possibly related to age, which is discussed later in this section.   5.1.8 Tenure In both analysis of variance and structured equation modelling, tenure showed a non-significant relationship with individual perception of inclusion.  It should be mentioned however, that while the relationship was non-significant, it was only slightly below the guidance value with T=1.87.  While the null hypothesis was accepted, ‘there is no relationship between the tenure of the individual and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’, the research about tenure does not show support for this finding.  Pelled et al. (1999b) suggests that individuals with more tenure than the group average are likely to feel more included than other individuals.  Zenger and Lawrence (1989) found that technical communication is improved with team tenure, which is likely to affect individual perception of inclusion positively.  Ancona and Caldwell (1992) found that diversity of tenure showed a negative relationship with performance and innovation.  O'Reilly, Caldwell, and Barnett (1989) demonstrate that homogeneity of tenure is positively related to the group's social integration and that the aggregate social integration of the group is related to reduced individual turnover, and likely a better sense of inclusion.  While these studies do not relate specifically to inclusion, they show that tenure is likely to improve social inclusion and improve technical communication which illustrates that tenure is an important demographic consideration.   5.1.9 Age One-way analysis of variance tests indicated significant relationships between the age of the individual and his/her perception of senior management, immediate management,  perception University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  176of feeling valued by the organisation, view of promotion, progression and development in the organisation, experience of fitting in, and of being bullied and harassed.  When looked at simultaneously (SEM) there is a weak, non-significant relationship between age and inclusion.  Rosen and Jerdee (1976) found that age stereotypes portrayed this group as less able, and research by Pearce and Randell (2004), Cox and Nkomo (1992) and Rosenbaum (1984) showed that as age increases, likelihood of promotion decreases, which places this group at a disadvantage compared to younger employees.  These findings suggesting age stereotypes and employment discrimination on the basis of age could be related to the findings of  Findler et al. (2001) and Pelled et al. (1999b) who found that age was related to individual perception of inclusion.   Given that this research found a strong correlation between age and many of the inclusion categories in the ANOVA but did not show a relationship in the SEM, it reasons that individual perception of inclusion is influenced by age, but when looked at simultaneous with other demographic variables, the relationship is moderated.   5.1.10 Disability  A one-way analysis of variance test indicated a significant relationship between being disabled and  perception of being bullied and harassed.  The SEM supported this finding and indicated a very weak relationship between physical ability and an individual’s perception of inclusion which led to the acceptance of the null hypothesis: ‘there is no relationship between disability and diversity and inclusion in the organisation’.  While there is literature relating to the relationship between perception of diversity and inclusion and disability in schools (Norwich, 2009) and literature available between the relationship between disability and social exclusion (Clear & Dennis, 1999), searches of both the Emerald and Ebscohost databases indicate that possible research examining the relationship between individual perception of inclusion and disability in workplaces is not yet available in the public domain.    5.1.11 Final finding, Question 1: There is a relationship between race, position/grade in a company, location employee is based at and department employee works in and individual perception of inclusion.  Further, University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  177while tenure and age did not show statistically significant results on the SEM, it is likely that they too influence individual perception of inclusion.    5.2 QUESTION 2: IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY, INCLUSION AND PERFORMANCE IN CORPORATE WORKPLACES?   One-way analysis of variance was run using the averages of the InclusionIndex™ categories.  Categories fitting in (engagement), bullying and harassment (acceptance and respect), dialogue, and relationship with immediate manager showed a significant relationship with performance.  While this shows that these factors are related to an individual’s perception of inclusion, the structural equation model (which tests causality) suggests that performance is affected by individual perception of inclusion.  More specifically, inclusion is affected by the level of engagement the organisation has with individuals, the respect and acceptance individuals perceive, communication and the immediate manager’s ability to recognise and value individuals in the team with fairness and dignity.  Model 4.7 showed that all the listed inclusion factors showed a statistically significant relationship with inclusion, which was created as a latent variable in the model.  Performance, which was also created as a latent variable, with performance review scores as contributing manifest variables, was seen to be affected by variation in listed inclusion variables.  This suggests that performance is affected by an individual’s perception of inclusion, and is also influenced by an individual’s race, position in the organisation, location they are based at, and department they work in.  On this basis the alternative hypothesis, ‘there is a positive correlation between diversity, inclusion and performance in the organisation’, was accepted.  In direct support of the findings of this question, was research by Pearce and Randell (2004) who found that employees who perceived inclusion more positively, performed better than employees who perceived inclusion less positively.  Cox (1993) suggested that diversity results in benefits for the individual and for the organisation.  Milliken and Martins (1996:402) argue ‘that diversity in the composition of organizational groups affects outcomes such as turnover and performance through its impact on affective, cognitive, communication, and symbolic processes’.  Kochan et al. (2002) argues that the positive and/or negative impact of diversity on outcomes such as performance hinges on organisational practices as well as on the culture and business strategy of the organisation, University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  178but has no direct impact itself.  Despite these encouraging insights, numerous researchers found that homogenous teams performed better than heterogeneous teams (Pelled, Eisenhardt & Xin, 1999; Tsui, Egan, & O’Reilly, 1992; Jackson & Joshi, 2004; Alcona & Caldwell, 1992), while others, (Fiedler, 1966; Ng & Tung, 1998; Richard, 2000) found that heterogeneous teams outperformed homogenous teams.   5.2.1 Final finding, question two There is a relationship between an individual’s perception of inclusion and individual performance.  The SEM suggests that variation in individual performance is strongly accounted for by the level of engagement the organisation has with individuals, the respect and acceptance individuals perceive, communication and dialogue about diversity and inclusion issues and the immediate manager’s ability to recognise and value individuals in the team with fairness and dignity.  It is further affected by senior management, perception of recruitment and promotion processes, individual’s sense of belonging, which enhances an employee’s perception of fitting in, and an environment where diverse people are welcomed.     5.3 QUESTION 3: WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS THAT DRIVE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN A CORPORATE WORKPLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA?  The final model (Figure 5.2) was influenced by the quantitative and qualitative results of the InclusionIndex™ survey, suggested diversity and inclusion influences from various researchers, interviewees’ insights and experiences of diversity and inclusion, and focus group insights around the benefits and challenges of diversity and inclusion.  Below, the model is presented, showing components relating to the individuals’ perception of inclusion in a South African environment.  Relevant literature is used to support the claims where possible.   The term ‘representative diversity’, relates to a heterogeneous workforce, representative of the diversity available in the community.

While a diverse environment is necessary in this research to drive an inclusive environment, an inclusive environment informs how representative the organisation remains through retention, which in turn affects the human resource focus, including pr cesses such as recruitment.  A key output of this research is that a successful diversity and inclusion strategy needs to be managed at organisational, interpersonal and personal levels (Cox, 1993; Herriot & Pemberton, 1995; Kendall, 1995; Louw, 1995; Schultz et al., 2008)  including the following components:  5.3.1 The organisational components:  The main components of ‘Organisational’ were ‘Senior Management’, ‘Organisational Climate’, ‘Organisational Belonging’, ‘Dialogue’, ‘Recruitment, Promotion and Development’.    5.3.1.1 Senior Management The ‘Senior Management’ component speaks to whether diversity and inclusion are important to senior management, whether they really care about the well-being of individuals and whether they genuinely appreciate the difference in people (InclusionIndex™ survey).  It also concerns the leadership of diversity and inclusion in the organisation, which relates to whether employees are kept informed about issues relating to diversity and inclusion, and University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  180whether they understand how their individual goals relate to the organisation’s objectives.   Griggs (1995:12) says that ‘if organizational objectives and organizational successes are to be realized, all of today’s leaders, at all levels, must focus on relationship dynamics and assume facilitative and enabling roles'. The importance of senior management to inclusion was highlighted by Pless and Maak (2004) and Roberson (2006) who highlighted that a co-operative leadership style are important in defining and leading a diversity and inclusion strategy.  Further, Prahalad and Bettis (1986:12) highlight that ‘the strategic variety that a firm can cope with is dependent on the composition of a top management team’ suggesting that not only is leadership around diversity and inclusion issues important, but so is the diverse representation of the senior team.  5.3.1.2 Organisational Climate The ‘Organisational Climate’ component addresses whether the organisational climate is inclusive in structure, process and policies.  An inclusive structure allows people from diverse backgrounds to participate at all levels and divisions within an organisation.  Processes could include human resource processes such as a comprehensive performance management process, which facilitates goal-setting and performance monitoring, but may include training for line management on how to drive inclusion at an individual level.  Policies such as flexible working times and place, maternity/paternity leave or education assistance policies are examples of how an organisation can regulate the environment in order to accommodate individual needs.  In practice, structures, processes and policies are too numerous to list, and differ between organisations and industry sectors.  The importance of organisational climate to perception of inclusion is supported by Cox (1993).  In the ‘diversity climate’ component of Cox’s (1993) model, the management of ‘Institutional bias present in HR systems’ is highlighted as important to this dimension.  Benschop (2001) and Kossek and Lobel (1993) outline that many organisations ignore the role of human resources in implementing and integrating diversity management which ultimately compromises their success.   5.3.1.3 Organisational Belonging The ‘Organisational Belonging’ component refers to the individual’s sense of belonging in the organisation, and refers to whether the employee fits in well at the organisation, and feels committed and dedicated to the organisation (InclusionIndex™ survey).  According to the interviews, organisational belonging is driven through individuals identifying with their team University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  181members, feeling integrated into their teams, feeling supported by their colleagues and being invited to social events.  This finding is supported by Gasorek (2000) who argued that to drive an inclusive environment, current employees should feel that they belong and prospective employees should feel attracted to the organisation.   5.3.1.4 Dialogue While the InclusionIndex™ only measured ‘Dialogue’ around diversity and inclusion issues, the qualitative research suggested that overall dialogue is one of the key components that drive an individual’s perception of inclusion.  This extends to whether individuals regularly see and hear about diversity and inclusion, and whether they are well supported issues.  It also addresses the perception of informal networks,  whether individuals have access to the information they need in order to do their jobs (Pelled, Ledford & Mohrman, 1999), and whether the organisation is open to dialogue and open and frank communication (Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Avigdor et al., 2007; Pless & Maak, 2004; Morbarak & Cherin, 1998)  5.3.1.5 Recruitment, Promotion and Development The ‘Recruitment, Promotion and Development’ component addresses  fairness around these processes (Avigdor et al., 2007; Roberson, 2006) and whether there are equal opportunities available for progression and recruitment of individuals from diverse backgrounds.  Development, specifically, refers to career development plans for all individuals in the organisation.  A development plan does not necessarily mean that all employees will be promoted within the organisation, but suggests that employees will be provided with the training and development to grow their competencies and skillset in line with market requirements (Morbarak & Cherin, 1998; Roberson, 2006).   5.3.2 Interpersonal components: The interpersonal component deals with individual interaction between two or more people and concerns the environment that is created as a result of that interaction.  At an interpersonal level, the components included ‘Respect and Acceptance’, ‘Individuals Engaged by their Immediate Line Manager’, which included trust, recognition and dignity,  ‘engagement’, which incorporated decision-making and access to information, and finally the ‘Individual’s Relationship with his or her Organisation’s Vision and Values’.   University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  1825.3.2.1 Respect and Acceptance The perception of ‘Respect and Acceptance’ comes when a person feels cared about as an individual, when he/she feels engaged, when his/her individual contribution is solicited and valued (Avigdor et al., 2007; Davidson & Ferdman, 2002; Gasorek, 2000).  When acceptance and respect are missing, individuals feel threatened, bullied and potentially harassed.  Stereotypes lead to a lack of respect and acceptance, as people make assumptions based on groups, not considering an individual’s contribution.  Pless and Maak (2004) cite respect as a key component of their diversity and inclusion model.  5.3.2.2 Individuals Engaged by their Immediate Line Manager ‘Individuals Engaged by their Immediate Line Manager’ involves managers valuing individual contributions, treating them with dignity and fairness, and caring for them as individuals (InclusionIndex™ survey).  In the interviews, employees indicated that feeling valued, recognised, empowered and that their opinion mattered, were key to their perception of inclusion.  As the line manager is the gatekeeper of these behaviours in the workplace, they are pivotal to an employee’s perception of inclusion.  The line manager is also an important player in driving the employees’ experience of trust in the organisation, and since trust is ranked as highly as respect in the qualitative research, this component is very important in this research.  Griggs et al. (1995) suggest that trust and trustworthiness are the foundation of effectiveness in today’s organisations and suggest that organisations increase knowledge and acceptance of employees' differences, create awareness of relationship dynamics, demonstrate the effect of energy-enhancing and energy-depleting patterns, illustrate the power of relationship among diverse individuals in the organisation, and enable employees to begin the crucial steps to build trust.  These findings were supported by Pless and Maak (2004) who suggest that managers should create an environment of integrity with their subordinates and show  advanced moral reasoning.  Davidson and Ferdman (2002) propose that validation, acceptance, and appreciated is key to an individual’s perception of inclusion.  In her research, Kokt (2003:82) finds that the role of the team leaders is crucial in managing diversity and suggests that they receive diversity and leadership training to enable them to deal with team members effectively.    University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  1835.3.2.3 Engagement ‘Engagement’ refers to the culture of engagement within the organisation, beyond the manager-employee relationship.  It relates to whether diverse views and opinions are solicited and heard.  Decision-making forms part of this component because in an engaging environment, decision-making is decentralised, and individuals are empowered to make decisions (Gasorek, 2000; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998; Pless & Maak, 2004).  Gasorek (2000) suggests that employees want to feel valued and know that their ideas are taken into account and use participative decision making and problem solving processes.   5.3.2.4 Relationship with Organisation’s Vision and Values The last interpersonal component is the ‘Individual’s Relationship With his or her Organisation’s Vision and Values’.  This point relates to whether the individual’s values align with those of the organisation.  Further, it relates whether the organisation’s vision, mission and values were well formulated and communicated to employees.  5.3.3 Personal components:  At a personal level, it was evident during the qualitative research that an individual’s perception of inclusion varied according to the personal dimensions outlined in the model: ‘Personality’, ‘Locus of Control’, ‘Self-Confidence’ underpinned by ‘Self-Esteem’ and ‘Power’.  While research in this area is limited, researchers highlight that the factors that influence individual perception of inclusion at an individual level concern the self (Schultz et al., 2008), involve identity structures (Cox, 1991), prejudice (Cox, 1991; Louw, 1995),  biases (Louw, 1995; Schultz et al., 2008), stereotyping (Cox, 1991; Louw, 1995), personality (Cox, 1991), assumptions (Louw, 1995), expectations (Louw, 1995), perceptions (Louw, 1995), past experiences (Louw, 1995), feelings of the individuals in the organisation (Louw, 1995), engagement in continuous learning (Schultz et al., 2008), understanding of personal attitudes and behaviours (Schultz et al., 2008) and identification of personal assumptions and beliefs (Schultz et al., 2008).  It could be said that the individual elements highlighted by this research (personality, locus of control, self-esteem, self confidence and power) form part of the self (Schultz et al., 2008).     University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  1845.3.3.1 Personality Personality is measured by the five-factor personality traits model designed by Costa and McCrae in 1985. The factors are Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, and Openness to Experience (Zimmerman, 2008; Nettle, 2006).  While there is no relationship which looks at the effect of personality on individual perception of inclusion, research this area shows that an individual's dispositional traits have important effects on their job satisfaction, performance, and turnover decisions (Barrick, Mount & Judge, 2001; Judge & Ilies, 2002; Zimmerman, 2008).   5.3.3.2 Locus of Control The concept of Locus of Control was created by Rotter in 1966.  Loosemore and Lam (2004:397) say that ‘a person’s locus of control refers to an individual’s perceived mastery of their environment and how far they see themselves in control of their destiny’.  While individuals with high internal locus of control (internals) perceive that they are in control of their experiences and responses, individuals with high external locus of control (externals) perceive the opposite, that they have no control over their experiences and responses (Loosemore and Lam, 2004;  Boone et al., 2005).  While there is no research which examines the relationship between inclusion and locus of control, Boone, Van Olffen and Witteloostuijn (2005:889) found that teams with ‘high average internal locus-of-control scores performed better without leaders and with low locus-of-control heterogeneity. The opposite was found for teams with high average external locus-of-control scores’.   Self-Confidence It became clear during the semi structured interviews that ‘Self-Confidence’ and ‘Self-Esteem’ affected individuals’ expectations and perception of inclusion.  Dubrin (1994:430) defines self confidence as ‘a basic belief in one’s ability to achieve the outcome he or she wants in many situations or in a specific situation’. Be´nabou and Tirole (2002) state that individuals who are driven by high self-confidence respond to situations with ‘can do’ optimism in economic and social interactions and that they have a higher motivation to act.   In the context of this study, an individual’s confidence stems from self-belief, and relates to an individual being able to be self-assured in who they are.  In relation to inclusion, this manifests in terms of some individuals feeling less entitled to speak their opinion and other individuals feeling they are entitled to have their voices heard and their suggestions acted University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  185upon.  Self-confidence suggests that should they choose to, all individuals will be in a position to speak with conviction about their beliefs. 5.3.3.4 Self-Esteem Self-Esteem is defined by Blascovich and Tomaka (1991:115) as ‘the extent to which one prizes, values, approves or likes oneself’.  Brin˜ol, Petty and Wheeler (2006:155) found that ‘discrepancy between explicit and implicit self-esteem scores is associated with implicit but not explicit self-doubt’.  Judge and Bono (2001:155) find that self esteem, self efficacy, locus of control and emotional stability are ‘among the best dispositional predictors of job satisfaction and job performance'. Research by Swann, Chang-Schneider and McClarty (2007) brings these findings into question with their claim that the links between self esteem and important outcome variables are small and inconsequential.   5.3.3.5 Power ‘Power’ relates to how power, dominance or status affects interpersonal interactions in terms of cognition and behaviour and has recently moved to the forefront of many researchers’ attention according to Mast, Jonas and Hall (2009).  Edmonson, Bell and Nkomo (2001) have found that power resides in deep-rooted racial values which are translated from individual and societal levels to organisations.  A person with high power is an individual that exerts control or influence over another person and a person with low power is someone who is subject to the control of another person (Mast, Jonas & Hall, 2009).  While there is no research to support this claim, interviewees suggested that their perceived lack of power affected their individual perception of inclusion.    There is limited research examining the relationship between the individual concepts listed  above and individual perception of diversity and inclusion.  This has led to a presentation of the findings rather than a discussion related to other research.  It is not clear whether the personal factors highlighted by this research are directly related to an individual’s perception of inclusion because these factors were not tested empirically.   In summary, to enhance performance through diversity and inclusion, or simply to drive diversity and inclusion for the sake of transformation, the proposed model should be implemented and diversity and inclusion should be driven at  individual, inter-personal and organisational levels.  As mentioned in chapter two, this model is not a diversity and inclusion management model, it is a model outlining components that organisations should University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  186consider when driving an inclusive environment.  It should be mentioned that each organisation and environment is different and this model can be used as a starting point, but organisations will need to build and refine it according to their operating environment.    5.4 IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH The link between inclusion and performance is valuable as it can be used to build the commercial argument for inclusion.  If leaders understand that individual performance is being compromised because people feel excluded, it provides further motivation to change the status quo.  Private organisations are driven by profits and it would be difficult to justify not leading an organisation in this direction if it is seen to affect return on investment for the shareholder.    Understanding that race, position, location and department affect an individual’s perception of inclusion and performance can prove useful as a diagnostic tool for pinpointing areas for development.  While these findings might outline opportuniti s for improvement, this case study organisation is likely to represent one of the more positive situations in South Africa.  Although it is apparent that are inclusion improvement opportunities, this organisation was chosen because it is considered one of the best in South Africa in terms of its diversity practices, and has been a case study for diversity in a few South African textbooks (Human, et al. 1999; Human, 2005).  If this is the situation in an organisation which is considered to be leading diversity in South Africa, it is clear that there is a need for organisations to examine how they can make their environments more inclusive.   The diversity and inclusion model (Figure 5.2) is useful as a guideline of elements that should be considered when organisations are creating their diversity and inclusion strategies.  Rather than implementing processes and actions that are not likely to change or influence the organisation’s climate, the diversity and inclusion model is likely to help organisations deliver a multicultural environment.    5.5 LIMITATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH A key limitation of this research is that the quantitative analysis, including correlations, factor analysis, ANOVAs and structural equation modelling, was done excluding valuable University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  187components identified in the qualitative research.  It would have been ideal to test the relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance through structured equation modelling using the components outlined in both the quantitative and qualitative methodologies.    A second limitation was the relationship between individual perception of inclusion and performance did not include responses from shop floor respondents because they were excluded from the formal review process at the research organisation.  As the ANOVAs between departments listed shop floor employees as having the least favourable perception of inclusion, this was not ideal.  Further, the May performance data for years 2007 and 2008 performance does not appear to be a reliable measure of performance, because performance ratings are done for employees’ increases, not with the intention of correcting performance.   A third limitation is that research relating to inclusion, and to the relationship between demographic variables and inclusion is limited.  This constrains the insights that can be found when comparing similar/dissimilar research, which are invaluable in building new findings.  Further, the measures of inclusion vary between studies, which compromises comparison of the findings.  Finally, the research that does examine the relationship between inclusion and demographic variables fails to consider the variables parsimoniously, which affects the scale of the interpretation.  A fourth limitation is caused by the unavailability of a second dataset which could have been used to compare the findings from the organisation used for this research.  The comparison could have yielded valuable insights which could have been used to progress the field of diversity and inclusion in South Africa.  Multiple studies allow researchers to establish trends in data which could otherwise be dismissed as a unique to single site studies.  A multiple site rollout was constrained by the cost of the survey, which is a privately owned international tool.   A fifth limitation was that the internal significance of emotional well-being data (of the InclusionIndex™ survey) did not meet internal consistency requirements for analysis and therefore could not be used for this research.  The insights from this analysis could possibly have been used to support or dismiss the findings of the personal component of the qualitative analysis.   University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  188A sixth limitation related to the lack of inclusion data available on the personal component of this research.  The insights about the components highlighted in the research such as personality, locus of control, self confidence, self esteem and power were not raised in other research and the findings could therefore not be compared or dismissed based on other research.   A final limitation is that inherent in qualitative research is the potential for the interviewer to influence responses and also to introduce bias in the analysis of data which influences the accuracy of the reporting.   5.6 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH Firstly, the personal component of this research needs to be substantiated with further research.  The researcher would suggest that quantitative research be conducted to build on the concepts of personality, locus of control, self-confidence, self-esteem and power to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena, followed by quantitative research to establish the link with perception of inclusion.   Secondly, more research is required to test the parsimonious interaction between diversity characteristics and inclusion.  There are many studies which examine the effect between numerous diversity variables and outcomes such as performance and innovation, but there are few models which tests these variables parsimoniously (Jackson & Joshi, 2004).  The statistically non-significant results on the SEM for age, tenure and gender brought into question the arguments made by other researchers and did not support the findings of the ANOVA.  Further, gender and position in the company are other areas for further investigation.  While the finding that gender does not relate to an individual's perception of inclusion contradicts most research in the area, there was no literature examining the relationship between position in the company and individual perception of inclusion.  Therefore, further research needs to conducted into the relationship between inclusion and tenure, age, gender and position in an organisation.   Thirdly, there is opportunity for the model of diversity and inclusion to be refined with further research and investigation.  The model was built considering insights from this research, but failed to consider additional elements suggested by diversity and inclusion University of Cape TownChapter 5: Key Findings, Limitations & Suggestions for Future Research  189researchers.  While this research supports many of those findings, there is an opportunity to streamline the model using some of those insights.   Fourth, an interviewee suggested that she had resigned from the research organisation because she felt excluded in her team. A second interviewee, also serving his last month of service claimed that his leaving was not related to his individual perception of inclusion. The researcher was unable to find research testing the relationship between perception of inclusion or exclusion and labour turnover. There is an opportunity for further research to be done in this area.   Fifth, research about diversity and specifically inclusion in South Africa is limited and industry would benefit from further research which would refine the diversity and inclusion model and its use in organisations.  While Employment Equity legislation (Republic of SA, 1998a) has aided South African organisations in becoming more representative of the demographics of the country, as outlined in the literature review, there is a need for organisations to move beyond an assimilation approach to an inclusive approach.    5.7 CONCLUSION Considering the legacy of Apartheid, it is understandable that some organisations are struggling to move past the transformation difficulties they face.  The reality, though, is that assimilation and lack of inclusion is manifesting in outcomes such as low morale, lack of commitment, job dissatisfaction, employee turnover, and compromised talent attraction, all to an extent where business objectives are compromised.  In addition to outlining the commercial, legal and moral benefits of a diverse and inclusive environment in chapter two, this research has managed to show that perception of inclusion affects individual performance, building on existing commercial drivers for change.  In order to reap these benefits, an inclusive culture needs to be led by senior management, which involves a departure from assimilation.  While it is clear from the diversity and inclusion model that intervention is required on organisational, interpersonal and individual levels, the essence of inclusion is ultimately about ensuring that every individual is treated with the dignity, fairness and respect that he or she deserves.

University of Cape TownAppendix A  219APPENDIX A  The quantitative analysis in this research was done using the InclusionIndex™ survey. The survey is a commercial tool, owned and administered by ‘Performance Through Inclusion’ which is used to measure perception of diversity and inclusion in the workplace.   As outlined in chapter 3, there are 10 components to the survey.  Each component consists of several questionnaire items which aid in measuring the component.              Diversity and Inclusion measures as outlined in the InclusionIndex™ survey. Source: Author   Kettleborough (2006:3) outlines more detail on the components:  “The InclusionIndex survey measures the organisation against eight Inclusion ‘areas’ as follows:   1. Senior leadership – the extent to which senior leaders value Inclusion and behave in an inclusive way   2. Immediate managers – as above for line managers  Diversity &InclusionImmediate managersSenior managersDialogueBullying and Harassment RecruitmentPromotion, Progression & Development ValuesEmotional WellbeingFitting InOrganisationBelongingUniversity of Cape TownAppendix A  2203. Values – the values and ethics of the organisation.  Perceptions and experiences of worklife and flexible working are also considered in this section   4. Recruitment – the extent to which the recruitment process is inclusive and free from bias   5. Promotion, progression and development – the extent to which the promotion, progression and development processes are inclusive and free from bias.  Is promotion driven by merit, or networks and face fitting?   6. Fitting in – how much colleagues feel that they fit in to the organisation   7. Bullying and harassment – the extent to which individuals from different demographic groups experience bullying and harassment  8. Dialogue – The level of publicity, communication and colleague understanding of Diversity and Inclusion   In addition, the tool also measures two ‘engagement factors’:   1. Organisational belonging – the level of loyalty and commitment felt by colleagues   2. Positive and negative emotional wellbeing – these measures highlight the levels of morale and distress felt by colleagues across the organisation”   As the survey is a commercial tool, the researcher agreed with Performance Through Inclusion that the examiners or anyone else that would like to view the tool should contact Simon Kettleborough, Director at ‘Performance Through Inclusion’.  More information about the survey can be seen at: http://www.inclusionindex.com or http://www.inclusionindex.com/openIndex.htmlUniversity of Cape TownAppendix B  221 APPENDIX B  Qualitative Interviews: Understanding Composition of Individual Inclusion  I anticipate the interview will take around 30-45 minutes of your time.  Are you okay with this?   For the purpose of my research I would like to ask you a few questions around diversity and inclusion.  This information is strictly confidential (between you and me only) and will be used entirely for research purposes.  The responses to your questions will be consolidated with all other responses to determine measures that affect perception of inclusion in the workplace.   INDIVIDUAL 1. Can you name the top 3 things that make you feel included? a. And the top 3 things that make you feel excluded in your work environment?  2. How is your unique/individual difference recognised in your team  a. How does this relate to your experience of inclusion?   3. Do you feel respected in your environment/team?   a. How does this relate to your feeling of inclusion? 4. Do you feel that you are accepted for who you are as an individual in your work environment?   a.

Some marginalised individuals have an unjustified and unnecessary inferior complex.     If you don't understand where people are coming from it is difficult to engage them     This requires me to give up who I am and adopt another belief structure     I would need to compromise on what I believe in, and change.

Hard to be honest about these issues- say what we want to hear     Political game- we need to say what's right to be promoted     Difficult to be politically correct and do this.     High ego environment means that we don't respect others opinions and don't listen to each other     This needs to be lead by senior management     Favouritism is a problem     We operate in silos     There are barriers to entry for equity individuals like psychometrics      We don't interview based only on the CV     Recruitment is a big barrier     We all are on the same wave length now   Macro factors Socio economic progress is holding us back 5   We can't change a system overnight     Our perception is our stance- only when that shifts can the rest shift     We don't know how     Xenophobia in outside environment affects us   Preconceived ideas Do we want to do this independently of the employment equity legislation? 3   Do we compromise on ability?

AuthorUniversity of Cape TownAppendix D  249 APPENDIX D   Code: No relationship between acceptance and perception of inclusion  P 2: but I do feel accepted just by again I think being invited to have lunch, being asked questions.   P 2: No I don't feel more included because I am accepted. I find that I can function quite fine. Cause I’m quite an independent operator. So if I am not part of things I feel I can still feel included in a bigger or wider sense.   P18: Well, if each one accepts each one’s culture then in an environment if we work, we all have our own differences and cultures. If you don’t like something walk away. If you want to say something say it. I am not one that will talk about it, rather walk away and keep quiet. Being accepted does not affect my inclusion.  P23: Everything has pointed towards the fact that the organisation has valued me in terms of position, promotion, awards, we value you yet the environment hasn’t been inclusive enough to say and we can accommodate you as the person who has needs  P30: That I can be my own person and contribute what comes from within and not what I feel I need to be for the company.  Code: Relationship between acceptance and perception of inclusion  P 4: acceptance highly affects my inclusion, I feel comfortable that I am part of the t am.  P 5: Yes, there could be (a relationship between acceptance and inclusion) because if you are all the time feeling frustrated because people don’t accept this is the way things are then you tend to draw back, do whatever they want because there is no acceptance that this is reality.  P 6: And I am not the easiest person in the world to get on with because I also like have strong feelings about certain things, I do feel I’m accepted and respected. It increases my feeling of inclusion.  P 7: That acceptance makes me feel included, um, for them to know that I am here, I’m two steps away I suppose that makes me feel included.   P 8: if I was different in some way I would be more accepted or like for example if I had to say, if I was Xhosa speaking I would be more accepted to certain people but that is not an issues. Generally that is the sense that I have. I am accepted for who I am. The way that I am. this (acceptance) relates positively to my experience of inclusion  P 9: So yes there is a relationship between acceptance and inclusion.  P12: So there is a certain degree when acceptance does relate to my inclusion. my inclusion definitely, coming from before and as a manager now obviously there had to be acceptance from certain levels and positions.  From senior manager point of view and that has a direct relationship. that acceptance with my inclusion and the way I felt, if I felt included because guys would open up more than if I would wasn’t a manager.   P13: I definitely feel that I am accepted and I think that it is closely related to feeling included. Almost feeling like I am part of a bigger family within an organisation.   P13: Yes, definitely for me anyway (there is a relationship between acceptance and inclusion).  P14: As I said we are one big family here. There are a few people who tend to turn the other way, or want to go the other way. I feel as if I am included in this environment.  P16: I would say being accepted in an environment is one of the key things in terms of ensuring that you have a good stay. It motivates you to get yourself more included than having to expect other people to include you in whatever activities. I think being accepted has is directly proportional to being included.  P17: Ja (I feel more included because I am accepted)  P20: Yes I do feel accepted and it does make me feel included. Only small things that others might not think are an issue. Maybe I am making an issues out of things that are not supposed to be issues.  P21: Being accepted for who you are is a part of inclusion. P22: If your role is to be controversial, not just for the sake of being controversial but to bring a different perspective then people are happy to include you. Does that make sense. Sometimes you almost have authority beyond your predetermined role and you will get asked for a view not just from your team but from other people. Pretty much depends on your brand, who you are and how you grow it and how you own your space.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  250P23: no. I have applied twice for a flexi time, flexi place contract and I have been turned down both times. Of been discouraged strongly from doing it. So I don’t feel the business wanted me to be the mom and a successful career woman.  P23: My reason for leaving is that there has not been an acceptance that those are my needs. I think it is not necessarily just as a woman but particularly a woman’s needs.  P24: Yes. I am playing it through a different angle. ( I am more included because I'm accepted)  P25: Sometimes people who don’t like my approach might not come and speak to me about certain things. And it is not excluding me from a cultural perspective but it can be difficult and then there is that cultural barrier between especially myself and the shop floor guys. They might find it difficult to speak to me one because there is a language barrier and two because they might view me as someone who is educated and they aren’t. Unless I relate to them on their level I think they feel excluded rather than me feeling excluded.  P25: Yes. (there is a relationship between inclusion and acceptance)  P27: if they don’t accept me for who I am then it is pointless, you can feel that exclusion. You can feel the vibe in the environment.   P28: A big part because we often don’t want to be someone else and we can only pretend for so only and being accepted for oneself makes you feel comfortable, you are allowed to be who  you are, same as regards respect. Don’t feel that you have to change or pretend to be someone else.  P28: Now I feel a bit more accepted by the team, just the longer you are involved the more included you feel.  P29: Ja, direct relationship. (between inclusion and acceptance)  P31: Yes (there is a relationship between inclusion and acceptance), in some degree yes but in some degree absolutely not, it depends on who the person is and the scenario and the environment. Some people yes, you are part of the team and feel included but some people absolutely not.  P32: Ya, I do feel accepted in my environment because as I said before about the views. The guys do accept what I have to put on the table. It is related to my feeling of inclusion. Because it is how I feel.  P33: I guess that you probably don’t even think about it because it is there, you don’t notice that you are included, it is just how things are. I am accepted and I don’t look at it in any other way.  P35: Yes because if you feel accepted in a group you will be included.  P35: Because I feel included, accepted and valued, I would give more.   P36: Again I think it is around the types of interaction and engagement you have with people so how do my relationships stand with the people I work with. The fact that we very often get together outside of work environment and you can be friends with the people that shows a high level of acceptance and that is really you are not forced to be engaging with the person, so if they choose to engage with you then there is an acceptance of the person that you are.   P37: Yes (I am more accepted because I am included), definitely, it is part and parcel of the package. If you feel excluded you are not going to feel accepted.   P38: Well it is very important to be accepted to be as you are in order to feel included. I think you are who you are and what you bring to the table is unique in its own right and it ultimately has to fit into the equation at some point in time.  P38: I think that with belonging comes the acceptance thing again. If this is where I feel I am supposed to do and this is where my input and skills are most valued, I would definitely feel more included or have the opportunity to feel more included.    P40: Yes absolutely. (acceptance relates positively to inclusion)  P41: Yes. I feel included  with my team mates but not in bigger than that.  P42: If you feel accepted within a group of people then you feel included. If they accept you, they respect you , they know you as an individual.   P42: I am not going to lie and say that because I am the only black I feel excluded. I think I do feel included in that respect.   P43: I think also on a higher scale because if people don’t accept you they will ignore you and I don’t feel ignored and I would feel bad if I were by my team or colleagues. You want to be accepted.  P43: Yes. (it affects inclusion)  Code: Perception of assimilation   P12: If I should take off everything of myself, like whatever bits of armour, be it intelligence, or dress or type of conversation you have. When you strip that down then you know who you are. Because I am very confident in that, I think everybody knows that though. So I am respected but it gets easily coined into a box of ‘those’  people. That’s the only problem I get, I have with it, that you know who you are but sometimes we allow ourselves to be panel beated into who we think we should be for a certain role, certain position, certain level even if you want to.  P18: I can’t say but I don’t feel excluded. I don’t feel that I am not included as long as I do my part. University of Cape TownAppendix D  251P23: Everything has pointed towards the fact that the organisation has valued me in terms of position, promotion, awards, we value you yet the environment hasn’t been inclusive enough to say and we can accommodate you as the person who has needs.  P23: It has just confirmed that as a woman the organisation is not inclusive, it is not truly inclusive of woman. It doesn’t work for them that we have children that need our time.  P23: know just from research that the more creative an organisation the more successful it is, or the more different views one has the mores successful but as individuals we don’t like it because it challenges our personalities so I have been disappointed because it means we keep employing the same people who fit the mould and if you are outside the mould it is not going to fit for you and I found that aspect of inclusion disappointing.   P25: Yes there is a relationship in terms of my perception of inclusion because I don’t believe that this company is a place for woman with kids. It is because of the culture of the organisation that it is, you feel excluded because people don’t care that you have kids. So my commitment to the organisation right now I would say is relatively between low and medium, more on the low side purely because I am a working mom and this organisation doesn’t really realise that.  Relationship between commitment and perception of inclusion   P 1: I had a discussion with a senior manager, one on one, I said to him I don’t want you to panic but I want to tell you I have had these three offers and to put it in the picture it is not a good time for them to be offering me jobs because I'm really overwhelmed with all this work, but I am still committed to the company. If you are committed it is tied into inclusion.  P 3: I would imagine that if I felt excluded I would not feel as committed.   P 4: all, definitely. But if you feel included then you tend to give a bit extra.  P 6: I think the more included you feel, the higher your commitment level will be. After a while it becomes less of a job and more I’ll do it because the guys need it. And the more included I feel in the group, the more I want to do. So it relates highly in terms of how I feel.   P 7: Well I just feel that it is a give and take relationship. I feel that the company has given me a lot, there is a lot of opportunity to grow here, um, you know there is a systems anywhere you look and because they are giving me so much I feel I have a need to give back. So it becomes a mutual understanding between myself and the company and by having this kind of relationship it makes me feel included in the company.   P 8: If you think about it, if I felt I wasn’t respected enough or the way I wanted to be, everyone might be different in that regard and it may be more or less important for a different person. If it is that, or just that on its own, it can have such a big impact on, well if I talk about myself it would have a huge impact on me which would impact on my commitment to the business and probably I could become despondent, all the other effects it could have.  P 9: Definitely, it makes more sense to feel more included. If I wasn’t committed I wouldn’t want to be involved.  P 9: I would say I have become more committed because the roles have been defined compared to there. As the commitment shifted higher the inclusion has also shifted higher.   P10: I feel very committed to do my job, giving 110%. I feel if you do feel more included, your feelings are taking into consideration, your situation is taken into consideration, it is a give and take.  The more they include me and accept me the more willing I will be to give. Understand that I need an hour here or there but I am willing to give it back. It is very much a give and take and even the whole flexi time does make you feel they care about you. They are trying to do something to take your situation into account but still get something out of you. I mean lets face it we are paid to get a job.  P10: Yes, (there is a relationship between commitment and inclusion) because if you feel totally excluded then commitment is not going to be there. They don’t care about me so why should I care about them attitude.   P11: Once again I think well.(commitment related to inclusion)  P11: Yes, I do because it shows that you will be able, willing to go further. If someone had to phone me this weekend and said listen we are going this weekend do you want to go and I say no and they phone me a second time and I say no again. Then they are not going to worry about me because he doesn’t want to do anything with the actual team. So ya, I would say ja, the more committed you are the more included you feel.   P13: My commitment to the organisationis relatively high, if it wasn’t I would have left by now. A lot of it has to do with the relationships in the team and with my line manager rather than the greater organisation. I am more committed to my team than the greater organisation. I feel like my team is an extension of my family. We have a very close and unique team that I am very committed to and I think as those team dynamics change maybe my commitment will change.  P16: There is a huge relationship between commitment and inclusion because the more included you are, the more you get to feel more valued and also you have hope and hope generates commitment.  P18: Well if you are committed to the company and you give all, your boss can see a committed attitude it gives you value added at the end of the day. there is a relationship to inclusion. P19: More included. Like I said I am here to put my 100% in irrespective if you are in a comfort zone.   P21: I think it (commitment) plays quite a significant role or part (in my inclusion). From my last organisation I feel there is more focus here in making sure that everybody takes place, making sure that everyone has an opportunity to be heard regardless of what your position is, that wasn’t necessarily the case in my previous job. For me it is wow, this is great, I love it.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  252P25: Yes there is a relationship in terms of my perception of inclusion because I don’t believe that this company is a place for woman with kids. It is because of the culture of the organisation that it is, you feel excluded because people don’t care that you have kids. So my commitment to the organisation right now I would say is relatively between low and medium, more on the low side purely because I am a working mom and this organisation doesn’t really realise that.   P27: Very much it relates because I think you have to be committed to feel included. If you are not committed to the company then you can’t be included because your soul isn’t in the company so then you can’t feel included. So I think it makes a big difference.  P29: I would think so ya, if you don’t feel included you wont be happy and you will want to leave.   P30: So in terms of inclusion as long as you are getting from the company what you would like as an individual and can contribute to the company what they need, then you will feel included. Necessary, worthwhile, but if you feel that the role you are in doesn’t make you feel a part of the company because you have negative feelings towards it then you start to pull away and feel a bit disjointed from it in my experience.   P32: So I was asked to stand in for the guy so I felt very included in that matter. As they saw me I was very committed at that time, that is where I felt very much included.  P32: Yes, I became more committed because I learnt some more stuff because I wasn’t not actually busy on that guys job only but was involved in more activities while standing in for that job so that was much interesting, and that is how I felt more committed.   P35: Because I feel included, accepted and valued, I would give more.   P35: In a way yes (more included as a result of commitment) And maybe that is how I do substantiate it sometimes now that I think about it. You do stuff and then hope that the ripple effect is that you are valued and you feel part of the team.   P37: Definitely, there is a huge from a personal perspective, a huge relationship with that(commitment). As soon as it affects you personally, if you are not accepted. I have seen a few examples of marginalisation and things like that and that affects your acceptance levels, the way you perceive it and you wouldn’t feel included, just from a personal level.   P38: I think if you perceive that you are being included and that you have the opportunity to be included and it is something you are actively involved in your commitment automatically increases, you feel more dedicated, you want to give more because your opinions are valued and you as an individual is valued. You know that whatever is unique about you, you are bringing to the company is appreciated and valued. So a person’s commitment to the organisation would be higher than someone who doesn’t feel valued to someone who operates in a silo to someone who isn’t included.  P40: I speak for myself absolutely yes, I do. The more you are included the more you positive you feel, you know more about decisions being made.  P42: Probably there is a relationship to that (inclusion and commitment). I think the two can go together up to a certain point. If management sees you as committed then you can feel you have been drawn a lot closer to part of decision making. If they see you are not committed they don’t know if you are going or coming so from that respect there is.  P43: Yes (commitment relates to my feeling of inclusion). It wouldn’t be nice to be in a company where you feel excluded, no one respects you it wouldn’t be nice to come to work, you need to be committed to come to work.  P43: I think my team is very committed including myself. They have been here long and are really committed. We are not people who say we don’t care even if we leave tomorrow, they are very committed people, happy with where they are, what they have. That relates very well in inclusion.   Code: No relationship between commitment and perception of inclusion     P 2: I don’t think my commitment is affected by my perception of inclusion, and I think it is because my low level of commitment has to do with the nature of the role and the opportunities that I see in the company, noting my levels of ability and what I want from a particular role from a job satisfaction perspective as opposed to the company doing anything.  P 2: So it doesn’t have anything to do with the company making my levels low. I don’t think it affects my inclusion on an personal level.  P 5: I don’t see a relationship (commitment and inclusion). If you don’t like what you do maybe you would be frustrated but excluded I think would be stretching it.   P12: I’m very committed to the company, and what impact, what influence? My commitment mostly driven from my side because I feel a massive degree of loyalty towards to company, and whether I felt committed or not it would not affect my inclusion.   P17: No… Um. I’m quite committed to working for the organisation and I think it stops there. it doesn't affect my inclusion. P19: I will always be committed but I don't know how it fits with inclusion. P20: It is the same, I still feel included, it is just the negative things that happen at that point of time, when it has gone and past I go back to normal. so commitment doesn't change my level of inclusion  P26: No, my level of commitment is a personal one, it is my goal or objective to see how far I can possible go but included I think that it is just seen for what it is, just something you are expected to do so no.   P28: Well it is more personal your goal. I don’t think it is related to being included.  P31: Um, not necessarily (there is a relationship between commitment and inclusion) in my line of work, no.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  253P36: I am not quite certain if there is a direct relationship.  P39: But from a personal point I do it for myself, I always try to do the best that I can while I am here. For me it is giving your best anyway.   P39: No. Shouldn’t be. (a relationship with inclusion and feeling of commitment)  P41: I don’t think there is a relationship. (commitment and inclusion)  Code: Relationship between communication and perception of inclusion  P 1: It does affect your inclusion. Obviously the guys are not talking to you about personal things you are not included in their lives, They treat you as a boss and that is it. They don’t feel comfortable to say they are battling with their ex-husband or their wife is this or that. That sucks.   P 2: I think there is sufficient communication. My manager sends us information and is good at keeping us informed. The same with other members of the team, they send messages to the whole team which keeps us all informed all the time. So I think this increases levels of inclusion.  P 3: he past year has been quite busy so we haven’t had as much sort of formal communication in terms of meetings, but certainly informally the communication. It does affect inclusion.   P 4: I think communication in our team is at a high level, positive, that makes everyone feel included. There is nothing that gets hidden, if there is something we need to work on as a team we are committed to all parties involved. Open communication.  P 6: So communication does play a massive role in whether you feel included or excluded. Also in terms of language used. Colloquialisms used. Just generally what we speak about.   P 6: Say for example you from another city and I’m from cape town and we come into the same company  and I say something which means absolutely nothing to you. and I say he’s from Manenberg. Now that is supposed to mean something to me, but it doesn’t mean anything to you and you sitting there and think ha? You feel excluded. So communication is one of the key reasons for making people feel excluded.   P 7: um, well it makes me feel included when it I know I can go and talk to my boss if I have any issues. When I am upset about something or happy about something or whatever the case it. Whatever I am feeling it makes you feel included if I know I can go an chat to them anytime or pick up the phone and speak to them.  P 8: Ya, if we don’t have communication that feeling or forming part, that oneness or togetherness would lack if we were not speaking to each other. it does affect inclusion.  P 9: I think we have open door policy. If someone has a problem with someone else they sort it out, very open communication in our team. That helps a lot. If someone has a problem with you then you sort it out and then it won’t be a problem and that counts a lot towards inclusion.  So the better the communication the better the inclusion!  P10: But I think communication with problems, we share problems, we share solutions. If someone has a problem they will send it out to all of us so you are included in the problem and finding a solution which is good, then they respect your knowledge and what you can bring to it.  P12: I feel more included because I am at liberty to come to you and walk into a senior managers office, but if I was still in a lower grade I wouldn’t because it would be purely based on work. There would be a vacuum between us. Now I can ask how is your son doing, are you still getting that new car? That’s my elaboration on that.   P12: sometimes via mocking and jokes, but if one can filter through what the issues is then it would have a positive effect on inclusion.   P13: Communication in the team is generally very good and again it feeds directly into inclusion for me. It’s gaining access to information. We are fortunate to have access to a lot of information and it is almost like that information empowers me to make more decisions and more important decisions for the business which makes me feel more included.   P14: Very good I would say (communication). Because of the level of communication it is quite good. It is good for inclusion.   P16: Communication makes people feel more included, if my boss says something happening, he calls me in, tells me I feel included.  P18: Communication is important, you need to communicate because if you don’t communicate you will feel a bit excluded, if your manager doesn’t communicate you will feel less included because then you don’t know what is going on. Communication is one of the main things. P19: More so (impact of communication on inclusion). Sometimes we don’t even have to talk about it everyone knows what has to be done.  P21: As I said it is the issue of Afrikaans, sometimes you are talking about something and people drift off into Afrikaans and if it is a particular topic or general information of things around you, decisions going to be taken, if it is said in Afrikaans then you have missed out. That is not 100%.  P21: I think we can, there is a lot of room for improvement. I always say to the guys on our team you know it doesn’t help for you to keep quiet and then when the alarm bells go off you start talking. If you need help you must ask for help.  P21: Positively. (relates to inclusion) We are getting there. It is good but not the best.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  254P22: In terms of, it has got better, it wasn’t always great. We have also had so many challenges, every time a new person comes in they look to those that have been to kind of model what is the right way to communicate but I think people speak openly, they speak their mind, they challenge, they say what they want to say. Open style of communication, you never have the sense that things are taboo.  P22: It gives you a positive experience.(communication and inclusion)  P23: Communication is pretty weak at the moment mostly because we don’t get together enough and it is email based. We have had poor meetings for quite a while other than a couple of different ones here and there. It affects my feeling of inclusion because I don’t feel drawn into the team and I don’t feel fiercely loyal to the team. I am loyal because it is the professional thing to do not because I am emotionally loyal to the team. I don’t feel the draw.   P24: Clear, no undermining, no perception, I am included. If any information is done it is set out, it is clear, it is concise, you are included so do the job.  P24: Yes. Not less information, but if the information isn’t clear. Information can be 2 lines but if it is clear and concise you are included.  P25: I sometimes feel there are things I want to say but for the sake of sparing other people’s feelings I don’t say it which could be a good thing, but if you look at it in that perspective, somebody looses, somebody feels excluded either the person who wanted to say the thing feels excluded or the people that didn’t receive it do you get what I am saying to you.  P25: So I think it can affect inclusion in the sense that some people are on a different levels of communication than others are which can make other people who aren’t on that level feel excluded. Sometimes I feel that because I am not able to say the things I want to say, I sometimes feel disempowered because I am thinking I am sitting on this and it is irritating but I have to keep quite because I have to spare that person’s feelings and whether it is in a public or private forum I would never say it so I go home and say it to my husband.   P26: the communication now at the moment is not what I am used to so there are few things where I am expected to know things but no one has informed me so I don’t feel included because everyone is trying to get it right that they are not looking at the bigger picture.  P27: If there is a problem if you are not just wanting to email they phone you, sort it out immediately so we communicate very effectively, there is never a sense of miscommunication, everything is clear.  P27: Well being part of the team if you are unable to communicate effectively to the team as a whole or individuals in the team then you will feel excluded because if you don’t get your message across then you are not part of that team anymore so that is a big difference.   P28: Definitely, if I wasn’t able to communicate efficiently with my manager* it would have b en a real problem. At certain times you need to go to them and say you don’t understand and if that wasn’t possible, if you don’t have that relationship you would have that feeling of exclusion so it definitely relates to inclusion.   P28: I get the information I need and what I am supposed to do also I am able to respond, so from my side it is fine.  P30: The more engaged you can be the more  by a certain person or people the more included you feel, the more interaction you have on a face to face conversation makes you feel more included.  P33: Communication can be one sided like top down communication with people then being too scared to answer back, comment.  P33: Personally for me I have relationships with all of them, personal relationships so in terms of my communication with them it is fine. There are certain members that I am only getting to know now but overall I am comfortable with the level so communication with the team.  P33: Yes. (it positively affects my inclusion)  P35: I think we don’t talk enough. People write emails and the other thing that could make people feel excluded is writing an email and then copying 500 people on it. Then it is still going on and on and it doesn’t need to, you could have just picked up the phone and in 2 minutes the issue could have been resolved  P36: in my older team was that there was quite a bit of skinnering and people talking behind others backs and I choose not to interact with that. When that communication happens it can lead to people being excluded but my experience of this team has been positive. So if the communication is positive and free flowing it definitely assists with inclusion.  P37: Again like I say the group that you belong to does play a huge extent not being biased or prejudice when saying that but here you talk the same language so communication we can talk about anything really and that does make you feel included more.   P38: information or involve you in certain projects they are running in the team obviously makes me feel more included.   P40: Whenever we mail we always add on all the other colleagues in the team, so it is always a 5 man email going up and down. Always included.  P41: It makes me happy that thing. Because we know sometimes what they are talking about in that meeting because they give us feedback.  P42: Yes, definitely. (I would feel less included if the communication was poor)  P43: Very open, very straightforward, very honest. On the level as well and I think because of that it sometimes would clash, people wouldn’t always, always be where someone doesn’t like that, but it is always addressed because of that openness, that would count positively towards inclusion.  Code: No relationship between communication and perception of inclusion P 5: Communication is happening and it is good. How it relates to inclusion, I don’t think there is a big relationship in my opinion. P11: That is difficult. I wouldn’t say it impacts (communication and inclusion). That is difficult.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  255P20: tell us in advance. But this doesn't affect my inclusion.  P32: Communication is not that good but it is getting there. Not strongly like how can I put it, not strongly identified. But we do communicate well with the guys, try to stress out our views amongst each other.  P32: I don’t think so. (communication affects inclusion)  P39: I feel excluded, but not from a personal perspective, the guys are used to fix things themselves.   Code: confidence   P12: That you don’t need to hide certain things, or you are not asked things from an inclusion point of few. It helps a lot that I did that because I feel included. The confidence to say that this is not the right thing.   Positively, I feel more included.  Code: Relationship between conflict and perception of inclusion  P 1: I kind of excluded her but only temporarily until she calmed down.  P 1: conflict if it comes to a positive outcome you would be more included with that person.  P 2: the consistency links to fairness, which would link to inclusion.  P 4: Yes, if there is conflict obviously there will be some sense of feeling not being excluded, conflict of ideas, conflict of personalities or of interest. Yes, conflict can also affect your inclusion.  P 4: One party in favour of it will feel included in making that particular point going forward but the other party will feel they are not part of it. Feel excluded.  P 5: How it relates to inclusion - it could affect it but I don’t think it would be a big thing.   P 6: If conflict is dealt with correctly, you feel very included. It is not about you’re wrong and I’m right and that’s how it is going to be. Then the next person is excluded. Then you are basically telling them their opinion means zero. And there is no real place for your view here. Where as if you tell them no, I appreciate your view, however this is what we need. I think if you respect people’s views, or they think you respect their views, or you listen to their views then they feel more included and they give better. If my view is respected and even in a conflict situation my view is acknowledged then I feel included in that group.   P 7: I actually wrote a letter to a senior manager and told him how I felt and he was actually very pleased that I wrote that letter for him to see because he knew that I could come and see him and tell him how I felt and what the issue was. And the manager actually ended apologising and to me and he said “I’m sorry that I spoke to you like that, I wasn’t even aware. I didn’t mean it and I didn’t even realise.” So the conflict was dealt with in a decent and realistic way and the outcome was achieved. Because it was dealt with in that way it made me feel more included. It wasn’t just put aside, the issue was resolved. So I feel that the way the conflict was handled made me feel included in the company.   P 8: You feel at that moment until it is resolved you feel less part of that unit or person or team. So it does affect inclusion. Yes, you feel less included.  P 9: plays a huge role in inclusion because basically the two don’t see eye to eye so they don’t include each other.  P12: conflict because I would be able to speak to the person. serious conflict is reduced if people feel included.   P13: I think when you are dealing with conflict directly it adds to my inclusion, but if you are not mentioning names and there is a hidden agenda it can lead to exclusion.  P14: Yes, conflict has a negative impact on my inclusion.  P16: No. Only if conflict is maybe one sided and resulting in an individual having a certain stereotype or perception against your direct report. The conflict could also hinder chances of you basically getting more involved, or getting included in business activities.  P21: I think while the decisions I took going forward with that case again were taken seriously and ya it was positive.(relationship to inclusion)   P23: I have sensed that because we haven’t been particularly close as a team, it hasn’t been not close, just hasn’t been particularly close like I would have liked, conflict is avoided and not worked through. We haven’t had high conflict. We have also had a manager who doesn’t like conflict and would move away from it. We haven’t had the healthy conflict, move through it, stronger result so probably the lack of conflict management and the lack of allowing conflict hasn’t helped my inclusion.  P24: Yes ( would feel excluded if I had conflict). Because conflict is a sign, it depends on if it is health conflict or because I can disagree and that could be a conflict. But we can agree to disagree because if my point isn’t then you must explain to me I don’t think you are right and these are the reasons why I don’t think it fits into what we are doing and it is healthy conflict. Saying you are stupid, you idiot, you are not doing what I asked you, that is a totally different concept. That is totally different and that can make me feel excluded.  P27: it will be positive conflict as everyone will giggle and say I can’t keep up with the pace or something like that and it is positive because it doesn’t bring the person down and that makes you feel included because we know what each other’s strengths and weaknesses are  University of Cape TownAppendix D  256P29: Conflict! That is not nice. We have a few issues again but we normally what we do is we go and chat about it and normally we sort it out without major issues. I must say we have issues but they are small, we can talk about it and solve it.  Not like we want to kill each other. The way to solve problems is also, will affect how people feel about inclusion.  P29: The relationship? I think it goes hand in hand, the more conflict there is the more the people will feel non included.  P30: Conflict was dealt with in a more aggressive approach than I would respond to, depends on the person some people like conflict, they like battling it out, they would walk away from it unscathed. If it was me personally I would tend to feel criticised or offended. Depends on what it was if I was at fault 100% I will take it, but I think if you feel attacked I would withdraw a bit and feel less happy with my space.   P32: I feel if there was more conflict and get a chance to resolve it I feel much more included.  P33: Well, if we are right in saying it is a whole culture thing, that maybe in a certain culture it is not right to confront your seniors or let things deal with themselves, we don’t want to fight, we know things aren’t right, we don’t want to discuss things, then it is definitely an exclusion thing, lets tackle our culture and say we have one culture but we also work here, how can we combine the culture.  P34: Not really because of trust. If you have trust you will never feel excluded because everyone else is open to each other.   P35: Ya.  Because depending on how the conflict is dealt with you might not be accepted anymore and you might be excluded from that group.   P36: People are very clear about their expectations and what needs to be done, so conflict as such I haven’t really seen. If there is not a sense of foreboding or conflict situation it helps people stay included, so makes it far more comfortable working environment.  P37: Conflict right now, I don’t like the way it is being dealt with, Like I say if it was a year ago my perception would be totally different but conflict right now is not being handled well by superiors. It is becoming more and more predominant that many people that I see can’t really handle conflict or they don’t know how to address conflict properly so they veer away from it and if you do allow that to happen to yourself you could exclude yourself. For me I am used to handling conflict so it wouldn’t affect me.  P38: At the worst of times (of conflict) I would probably have felt I wasn’t included, feel withdrawing, not part of that, whatever the situation was.   P38: I think what happens with that input will affect your feeling of inclusion or my feeling of inclusion. If it was brushed aside and not taken to heart, I would feel excluded.    P42: Definitely (there is a relationship between conflict and inclusion)  P43: There hasn’t been conflict, small issues would be addressed immediately there and then and move on. No one keeps stuff and doesn’t talk about it and then burst later, it is dealt with positively and so has a positive effect on inclusion.  Code: No relationship between conflict and perception of inclusion  P 5: Maybe an indirect affect on inclusion. I don’t see it as being a big contributor to feeling excluded.   P10: Wouldn’t say conflict I would say we are all strong individuals, we all have a lot of tenure so we all have strong opinions and we have all got our own opinions. Don’t know how it affects inclusion. I think we listen to each other, kind of tend to agree to disagree sometimes because we are all very much individuals. I don’t think we get enough time to discuss the conflict because our time together is short but I don’t know how it would affect inclusion.  P19: One day when we had a meeting and we had some discussion and I spoke to him and said if we don’t do this, can we do this and he said no. He said please behave in the meeting and I sort of walked out of the meeting and stuff like that. Then I feel. Then I spoke to him and said why I said that, you must understand our situation. Nothing will keep me down here. It is just words now but afterwards there is no bad feelings. It is just for now. Later I am fine. Not a big thing for me. It does not affect my inclusion. P20: There is no relationship there (between conflict and inclusion). I wouldn’t worry about it.    P22: Didn’t affect me at all.  P24:  Conflict and its impact on inclusion. I don’t know. I don’t see, because you can’t agree with someone all the time when you are included. You must be able to express your opinion and you must be able to have a debate and agree to disagree. Conflict has nothing to do with inclusion. But some people might feel that if there is a conflict situation that they are excluded not included but that is a state of emotion. If you know this is what I must do as part of my inclusion, it doesn’t matter if I am having conflict with you, the work can still go on.   P25: So I think in our team people are quite mature and so I don’t think conflict excludes.   P26: Conflict, myself personally, I don’t, because I am a straight forward person and have open communication with everybody, if there is a conflict, it is just sort of put on the table and I move on from there, so for myself personally it doesn’t have an impact on whether I am included or not.  P37: It would affect it if I couldn’t handle conflict.  P39: I don’t know I don’t think so (relationship with inclusion).  P41: It doesn’t relate to me.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  257Code: There is a relationship between contribution not valued and perception of inclusion.  P 2: I sat through the process and was not allowed to ask any questions, but he did ask me for feedback and I gave it   P 2: I suppose this would have been an incident where I felt that what I bring is not valued but it wasn’t where I couldn’t feel valued, it was about the skills, the knowledge and resources that I bring to the role wasn’t valued.   P 4: in my past, not at this company there was a circumstance where you go to a meeting where you find language is a problem with them speaking Afrikaans where I don’t know what they are saying. Diversity is not being appreciated there.   P 5: What makes work so interesting is that the fact that we are all so different.  P 5: That is what makes it so interesting from different places, learn a thing or two from each other. I for instance was working with ? for a long time and we learnt a lot from each other. He is a different generation for one and number two grew up in the whole struggle time which I don’t understand. He was trying to make me understand what he went through and I was trying to make him understand that look I don’t know anything about apartheid. I didn’t experience it. By the time I was big enough to experience it it was already gone, so you must move away from that apartheid times thinking and move on. We learnt a lot from each other. 1981 didn’t write matric or whatever. He says you guys are so fortunate because everything is there for you. If you don’t have what you need then it is a choice that you make.   P 5: I thought I was actually very glad I didn’t make that decision there and then. Said to him ok can we talk about it later, I am just going to find out for you. Thinking about things and realising that we are different. I know sometimes that my friends often tell me you don’t think about things you just say them so at work I try and be thoughtful about what I want to say. Having that mindset that this is someone else’s father. Because the whole cultural thing is a big thing. I have people reporting to me who have children probably as old as me. So sometimes the whole approach to things helps. Knowing that this is someone older than me and a sticky situation, so approaching it a different way might help. Would be different to the way I approach it with someone my age or younger. So I think that helps. Understanding individuals are individuals, we are not all picked from the same family. We have different backgrounds and different things happening.  P 5: I need to show that concern and care and how is she doing. I try and do small things.  You would say to me my mom is not doing well. Then you would think I had forgotten but three days later I say how is she doing. I think those things are very important because that is how I would like to be treated.   P 6: So if I am included from a group or excluded from a group doesn’t change that I am here to do something. I am here to excel. I’m here to exceed. And as long I keep my eye on that goal.   P 6: it doesn’t matter if someone else doesn’t like you. you like you. and if you like you I can look in the mirror and you can say you did well today then you are in the right place.  P 6: Exclusion and inclusion in a group specifically, I won’t say it doesn’t phase me, I mean everyone wants to be part of the group, but if I’m not, I still like me. If there is a problem with me then I must be honest enough to say, hey you know what, maybe you need to change or no, I am quite happy with still being here, and if I am not part of that group then I am not part that group.  P12: I am one of the few people that have to step out of a certain shoe and into a certain shoe. It is not good always, but I do it well. I’ve been with the company for a while and I’m going to speak to you frankly. I work hard at prospering at work because of the inclusion thing. That would be my focus point of conversation I think. Because I know I have immense knowledge and experience of what goes on. I’ve learnt a lot also, a strong point but it wouldn’t be my first point of conversation at home. I’ve got other loves, other passions that I would would rather be chatting about than that.  P16: I would say to a certain extent because we are aiming in a corporate environment, you want to grow in your career and once you start feeling less included, you tend to ask are you in the right place, in the right time, with the right people. After asking those questions you get to a point where you make a decision because of my values, I don’t think this is the right environment for me to be in considering certain facts in the environment. Whether do you stay and work on whatever makes you feel less included or do you try to progress further in life because you truly believe you have what it takes and you believe in yourself.  P16: Unfortunately this organisation is about the movement of white males. I don’t have a problem with people being appointment of roles for the colour of their skin because I have realised we need to emancipate our thinking, move forward. We need to look beyond the colour. People must be appointed by their ability to deliver.   P16: To a certain extent yes, I will be purely honest. I still think honestly speaking I am not a looser. There are certain factors in life you can fight and certain battles you just decide you don’t fight them. What you want in life is a very comfortable and peaceful life. Don’t want to be under pressure when you get home, honestly I truly believe this organisation is for white males.   P20: That used to because I don’t feel included anymore.  P24: No. I can because I can split it up into two things, I can say yes and no. It depends on the manager I had at the time, it wasn’t valued because of his management style. Now it is valued because, it is actually because of the management style and the person. That came back to your previous question, senior managers, the management style is of a certain nature, you can feel excluded, you change managers and you will find that the same position, the same work you were doing was cherished. So it depends on the line manager.  Code: There is a relationship between decision making and perception of inclusion.  P 2: I would rate them as moderate with a high sense of autonomy. And I think it makes me feel included from a team perspective but not necessarily from a company perspective  University of Cape TownAppendix D  258P 3: I feel more included because I have freedom to make my own decisions.   P 4: It makes you feel included because you are allowed to run your own show and make decisions based on what you think is right.   P 4: if you can’t make a decision you are getting told everytime, you don’t feel empowered.   P 4: If you don’t have any powers to make decision then you wont feel like you are being included, you are just here.  P 5: It feels, it relates to inclusion because I don’t think anyone would not like to be trusted (to make decisions).  P 5: Definitely relates. For me it goes together.  I feel like if I have made a decision and someone overrides it without making me aware or understand why, I just won’t understand that. Also leads to frustrations.   P 6: And how this relates to inclusion, exclusion, sometimes having to make decisions that are unpopular makes me excluded but generally if you make the right decision people understand if you explain it to them.  P 6: there is aspects of the job I know I know better than my manager or his boss in terms of I’m doing it. I’m hands on. I feel the sand in my hand. Sometimes a manager should put faith in his staff that he wants to do well, they want to succeed. I’m not always getting that. This makes me feel excluded, you feel your  opinions don’t matter and therefore I am not part of a group.   P 7: It makes me feel like I have a little bit of authority, which makes me feel included. That little bit of authority, it’s not much, but it helps.   P 8: The fact that my views and input, the fact that it is considered and I know I have an impact on the decision to some extent, that makes me feel included.  P10: I think the guys respect that so I think they probably include me more in decision making because I give them a straight forward answer.  P10: It does affect it, we went through quite a rough patch when they made a lot of changes as to how we did stuff and you felt a bit excluded then as in that power was taken away, it made it difficult to operate.   P10: No, not necessarily. I think if they include in your opinions in the change and take into consideration what you are saying the change can be good. I don’t think it makes you feel excluded, but the way they implement it can make you feel excluded.   P10: Well like I have said now a lot of the decisions are made at a central level. To a certain extent I do feel like we are excluded from those decisions. I don’t know what processes they have gone through before they have come to a decision, who they have included and who they haven’t. I think sometimes we are included and ask for information without knowing the bigger picture. It may give more meaning the answers and information you have to supply. From speaking from a higher position, no I don’t really fell included in their decision making. But that is my perception of it.   P11: I would like to think so, ya (there is a relationship between decision making and inclusion).  P13: Communication in the team is generally very good and again it feeds directly into inclusion for me. It’s gaining access to information. We are fortunate to have access to a lot of information and it is almost like that information empowers me to make more decisions and more important decisions for the business which makes me feel more included.   P14: To a certain extent yes (decision making is related to inclusion). There are times when I feel that the decision that are made are not always conducive to my job especially but I am conducive to change and if the company changes for the better then I will go with it.  P14: I would probably feel more included if I had more decision making power.  P18: Yes you will. Ya I think I would be excluded because then why are you there if you can’t make a decision for yourself. (the more decision making power you have, the more included you feel)  P20: I give the go ahead, I don’t need to speak to her, I just tell her later I did this and that so I feel included in that.  P21: For me it is also very important (decision making) because if you are in a decision making role whatever decision you make or whatever opinions you have are important and given that space to make them even if they result in a mistake, you have been given that space to execute whatever you had in mind and you having done that you can go back and look at could I have don’t it better, what are my other options, you explore what your possibilities could have been. Very important when you are trying to grow, helps you to grow, make decisions and look at the outcomes, if it was good, then we carry on, if there were problems then you look at it and if you need to ask for help you ask for help. It has an impact on inclusion.  P22: There are some managers that will put you through the training and give you the skills but do not give you the space in which to exercise them. The ones with good leadership skills allow you to do that. They give you the skills, they tell you what they expect, the trust you will deliver the output. How you get there is up to you. Those are attributes of good leaders. When you have, trust is pretty much part of being included. What I described to you as my experience has always been underpinned by trust because how else does it make it work. If you feel trusted you feel included, that has been my experience   P22: The sycophantic, perhaps too strong a term and I found that disempowering style because if you had a different point of view and you raise an issue it suddenly became your issue to sort out and you found that people tended to shut up after a while because if you raised a different point of view you suddenly got shouldered with doing that particular thing, like write a paper, write whatever rather than having that good debate. I found that disempowering because after a  while you learnt to shut up for your self preservation. Whereas what I have enjoyed in this region is that if there was an issue on the table everyone could contribute, the team would make a decision and you would find people would put their views on the table quite loudly.   P23: Not specifically (impact of inclusion on decision making), I have never felt restricted that because I am white or female or because I am a mom it has affected my ability to make decisions.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  259P25: I think it allows me the autonomy and the, it makes me feel that the decisions I make are important and it is not looked down upon because I am different or because I come from a different background or because I am female or younger, from that perspective it makes me feel as if my decision are respected and if I make a wrong decision I am allowed to say I made a wrong decision but I have learnt from it and lets move on, that is because of the manager I have.  P27: I don’t have much decision making power in my job but my opinion counts. I don’t have to make a decision but I can give my opinion and it might change that decision making the powers that be. It might influence that and that makes be feel included because my opinion does count and contributes towards what I do.  P27: Just that point at the authorisation level and there are lots of authorisation levels and it does make you feel excluded a little bit but I think I understand why there are so many steps so I would say it doesn’t make me feel that included but I understand why because I don’t think, I think it is higher than me because I am just an administrator*  P30: As far as inclusion goes if I could make a decision, you feel more empowered and feel better in your role.  I think it is where the boundaries are, if I couldn’t make a decision because not for a valid reason maybe then you feel disempowered because you can’t do what you want to do because you are waiting on somebody else.  So that becomes frustrating and you feel you can’t do your job properly.   P32: Ya there is a relationship because sometimes I feel included in the matter of decision making but within my job. Ya, I feel much included.  P32: So I was given the task of coming up with some strategies as to how the guys are going to work, so I have to make some decisions there, so and so is going to do this, this is how we are going to do that. The guys listen to me and I feel very much included.  P33: So while I have made some progress in earning that from him there is a still a gap and that is the part where I feel excluded (in decision making).   P33: Ya (it has made me feel excluded), but it has definitely improved like big time.   P35: Yes. (there is a relationship between decision making power and inclusion.)  P38: I think it does have a direct relation particularly when a decision is taken and it taken with ut out. I think obviously is you are not provided with the opportunity to input then I would personally feel excluded in that particular experience.  P39: I would say probably high because you are making decisions and people are making decisions based on your area of responsibility and you are not included in that it would be a problem ya.  P40: I speak for myself absolutely yes, I do. The more you are included the more you positive you feel, you know more about decisions being made.  P40: I think if you strike it right with senior management and they value your opinion they are going to listen to your comments and in terms of inclusion you will be included a lot more.  P42: Yes I think so (If was less involved in decision making I would feel less included) people are just do this and do that, there is no consultation, just tell you what to do.   P43: A little bit negatively. (relates to inclusion) P 9: Sometimes this makes me feel not included because I also have a voice and an opinion.   Code: There is no relationship between decision making and perception of inclusion.  P10: Difficult question because  I may make a decision based on a local need whereas someone may make a decision based on a regional or company need. Where I only see the small part of the picture. I might make a decision which they overrule. In that case it is not wrong, I don’t know if I would like more decision making. I feel quite comfortable with it now, my decisions are taken into account but then you need someone up there who will see the whole picture and make the right decision. I don’t feel less included because of my decision making.  P13: Um, actually I don’t know the relationship. I think I am quite empowered in my position to make decisions and I don’t know how it would relate to inclusion though.  P17: Something’s I think it is too much! Especially now with where I work there is only two of us. If  one of us is not there then…. There are certain decisions that I make, and if I  feel that I need that I need my managers approval first then I get hold of him. I don't see how this would relate to my feeling of inclusion though.  P24: There is no correlation I feel. No correlation.  P26: It is not that I can’t make those decisions, I do but I feel that there are certain people that are seeing with higher level of integrity because of their certain positions they hold whether they know about the job or not, or whether they have got that information from myself and then spoken to the powers that be. I wouldn’t say it has any relationship.  P29: No, not really. That doesn’t really make me feel like that (less included). I have a bit of decision making power but not as much as I would like. I don’t think that is direct link for me.   P36: No from what my kind of thought is about what I think inclusion is I don’t think it has an impact.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  260Code: development general code   P 5: That is exactly the reason I left my previous company because I felt we were all, we all went in as graduates in training and then after 6 months I felt so dropped, it just ended.  P 5: You are responsible for your own goals and own development.   Code: There is a relationship between development plan and perception of inclusion  P 3: It helps to feel more included. The opportunities are there but it is my choice.   P 5: I actually felt excluded now that you ask me. I don’t know if I would have thought about it like that at the time. I felt no one really cares, if they wanted a clerk why didn’t they just say so. Seriously, I thought this whole graduate in-training program is sold to you so nicely, this is what we are going to do, we are going to train you, we want a new generation of leaders and then they put you behind a desk with paper.  P 6: Not very good. I have been on two courses despite the fact that I asked for quite a few. And in terms of this I feel excluded. I have requested courses and either I get no feedback or I get told there isn’t time for you to go. Even though people in my same group have gone to those things. In that I feel excluded.   P 8: So the fact that I am, that my development that it is growing just in terms of, it impacts on my, you know like that, commitment or wanting to do more or go to the next level which is growth and it is also commitment.   Engagement, commitment.  Which obviously makes me feel included.  P 9: That someone else feels I have a future here, makes me feel inclusion.  P10: I think they try to develop. It is part of development is keeping people informed, the whole communication, not necessarily a training course so that I am up to speed on what is happening in my area. Based on the size it is difficult and does fall short sometimes. I think it is good, we could be included more.   P10: Yes, (there is a relationship between individual development and inclusion)  P12: my development over the last year as been very acute, and I had that relationship because other people and other parties, I could use those terms looking out for  me or driving that development from various departments. . I feel willing to learn. It has made me feel more included.   P13: A little bit yes. (excluded even though I have a development plan)  P14: Yes I am although sometimes I feel I need to do more self development but that comes with time I suppose.   P18: I am happy where I am, if I was younger I would probably have moved on. I think there is a relationship with inclusion.  P18: I mean if you have got a good relationship with your line manager and you sit down once a week and discuss, you always feel included. When can we have a one or one or you go to him. Have a cup of tea and discuss things. I do feel included in that.   P21: Ya, I think it is very important if as an employee if you feel your, if you articulate that you have problems here or like to develop yourself in a particular area and people consider that and if there is training available you are taken through that training or if someone can help you on a hands on basis, or guide you then that is great, that has been happening so I am happy about that. It makes me feel more included.  P23: So negatively. (impact of development on inclusion)  P24: And so development is there if I want to do it but it is up to me to want to start. Yes I am in a good space at this particular moment because I have closed all the gaps in my current position. We did the plan and I am quite comfortable.  P26: I think there is a relationship there (between development and inclusion) because it has made myself personally isolated. I would isolate myself like what I was saying before. I will just do what I have to do and get it done.   P28: I think the more you grow and experience the more you can participate and understand about the company. So the more you grow obviously the more included you feel because now you can relate to what that person is going through. If I take the first time I walked into the company I didn’t know what was going on as so obviously felt a bit excluded or isolated but it is up to you who much you are going to learn.  P30: Makes you feel part of the company(inclusion) and grow yourself within the organisation. You feel you have a longer road ahead, so feel even a bigger part of what you are today.  P32: Definitely I would if I didn’t have that. But as I said before you have to push to get there, don’t wait for someone else to get there. In that case of feeling less included if I wasn’t having development it depends on the person.  P32: So when he is busy in the office he gives me time to have practice on that matter that he is doing, his job in a way. By doing that to me he is trying to be there for me, he is actually there for me.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  261P32: I feel very much included.  P33: Just in terms of general development I haven’t felt excluded at all.  P34: Ya, I feel excluded because I can’t reach my individual goal.   P36: Um, ya, I think so. (relationship between individual development and inclusion)    P37: Definitely (a relationship between development and inclusion). The more knowledge you gain the more you can get yourself included in certain areas I feel.   P42: I think it does affect it, if you can discuss it and be told a realistic time frame you will feel included. You want to put your cards on the table and you must be able to be on the level to discuss it in x time so you feel you are working towards a goal and you know there are specific things you need to be competent for whatever position comes up and so I feel included.   P43: Very positively. (relates to my inclusion)  Code: There is no relationship between development and perception of inclusion.  P 2: I am not sure if my development plan impacts on my levels of being included.  P 7: I can’t say it affects my inclusion because I haven’t done anything about it. It doesn’t have any baring on my inclusion at the moment no.  P11: I wouldn’t say less (do you feel less included by not having a development plan?) it is just I think it is good for any person to know where they are heading.  P14: Not really. (more included if I felt developed)  P17: I think I do have a development plan but to put it into to practice at this point in time is a bit difficult for me. it doesn't relate to my inclusion.  P20: With my personal development I have done everything I set my goals to do because each and every time I must do my development everything else has been done. All my goals have been reached. It has made me feel more included.  P22: I don’t think there was a relationship at all.(between development and feeling of inclusion)  P24: There is no correlation. (development and inclusion)  P25: I don’t believe as an individual besides going on certain courses I have necessarily grown in leaps and bounds from a development perspective purely because this was a down move for me from where I was before but that doesn’t mean that I feel excluded because I know there have been umpteen attempts to get me to go on courses and I have said no I am sorry I am not interested, it hasn’t made me feel excluded in any way, if anything, I have excluded myself and there hasn’t been an attempt to exclude me.  P38: I personally felt I didn’t progress as steadily as I would have wanted to. I don’t think there is a direct relation to inclusion more than there is to just opportunities and I unfortunately was not presented, or couldn’t take advantage of the opportunities I had at the right time to develop my career.   P40: No not really (I don't feel less included because I need to be developed), but from a personal point of view there is a way to go.  Code: There is a relationship between empowerment and perception of inclusion  P 2: It probably may feel more included. I think what it would be is that the fact that I am empowered would make me feel that I am accountable for my role and responsible enough to be given the empowerment.   P 3: Ya, I think I do feel empowered to make decisions that are affecting my area and if I didn’t I would address it with my manager. It does help to feel included.  P 4: if you can’t make a decision you are getting told everytime, you don’t feel empowered.  P 5: Yes, definitely (relationship to empowerment).   P 6: The more empowered you are, the greater your feeling of inclusion. If I can speak the same language senior management speaks. Then I can sit in his company and feel comfortable.  If he talks about volume I know what he is talking about, when he speaks about production and sales targets I know what he is talking about. And if I don’t know what he is talking about then I am going to feel excluded.  P 7: My role does have quite a lot of empowerment and authority although I don’t use it to the maximum where I should, but ya, that’s. because he said to be more assertive, it did make me feel more included. Made me feel I can do this, I can do this, use it to your advantage.  P 8: I think the less empowered you feel in your position the lower the level of inclusion.  P 8: It does. I think the higher, like I feel empowered in my position, my job, what I do so it definitely impacts on my level of inclusion.  P 9: Sometimes I think in this business I don’t think females are empowered enough. I don’t see enough females managers in the company. I don’t feel empowered enough that I would get to that level. It is always men. It makes you feel excluded.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  262P10: I think mine are quite high here being on my own some. I am empowered to make decisions which affect me directly here. It doesn’t make you feel included because you are external to the team but from an organisational perspective it does.   P10: Because do you then feel they respect your ability to make decisions and to self manage. That is a bit of a contradiction because you are empowered to go and do your own thing yet you feel part of the bigger whole. It does make you feel included and accepted. They respect your decision making.   P11: Ya is affects my inclusion, obviously it puts more pressure on you because I mean everyone will leave me alone to do his job but if I had to do something wrong then obviously I will be taken up on that. Puts a lot more pressure on you.  P13: One word in there, power, hugely. For me, it is quite a strong correlation or relationship. Empowerment feeds indirectly into making me feel included. I almost don’t want to be left out of things. When you are given power you are given information and you are privy to things others don’t have access to, so it makes me feel part of the inner circle of trust.  It relates positively to inclusion.  P14: I feel very empowered. As I said I am accepted for who I am and I do feel empowered. this relates very good to my feeling of inclusion  P14: I feel more included because I am empowered.  P16: Also because I have been empowered. I have left that out of the equation. That is another thing. The most important thing is them being empowered.   P17: The job that I’m doing at the moment, has got all the necessary tools, the knowledge. I’m still learning actually, every day. this empowerment does affect my inclusion  P18: Good, ok my empowerment I am happy. I am always included.  P18: Yes you would feel less included if you were not empowered.  P21: I think it is great (makes me feel more included) because then there is that element of I am trusted, can make my own decisions. Also helps for me to consult depending on what decision it is just to bounce off ideas and make sure I am doing the right thing. P23: I supposed if I wasn’t empowered I would have wondered why so in that sense, yes. (I am more included)  P25: It is not an issue for me, I don’t feel disempowered. Not in this environment. Like I said earlier the only think that makes me feel less is that I am a working mom and that I make a big huw haw about it which sometimes maybe they request a meeting at 7 in the morning and I go I am sorry, I can’t be here at 7 in the morning. It sometimes does make me feel excluded because they look at me and say make a plan.  P26: Yes. (I do feel excluded here)  P30: I think very much so (empowerment relates to inclusion), if you feel you can’t do anything you become less proactive and less excited about what you are doing.  P32: I feel much more empowered and that affects the relationship of being much more included.  P32: Absolutely. I feel much more included.(because I am empowered)  P33: So again, probably says we are giving you the platform because we have faith in you which automatically eliminates any feelings of exclusion whereas if they didn’t give me the platform and didn’t empower me I would think they would clearly don’t see any potential in me and would say why. I have my platform.   P35: I think it is important to be empowered and the more empowered you are the more included you will feel. So yes, for example if you could make the decisions and you had the final say on something you would be more included than if you didn’t, and that relates back to doing the work  P39: Definitely has a relationship. Obviously what you are empowered to do allows you to include or exclude certain individual. Firstly yes it has a relation I don’t know how to put it.   P40: Usually empowered because of relationship with my boss and his boss. He allows me an open door policy with senior management which allows me to be included in comments, emails that sort of thing.   P42: If you feel empowered you definitely feel included.  P43: Yes. (I feel excluded here because I don't feel empowered)  Code: There is no relationship between empowerment and perception of inclusion  P 2: from my line manager there is high levels of empowerment and it makes me feel, I’m not sure if it makes me feel more included,  P12: up to a certain degree. it doesn't affect my feeling of inclusion.   P24: There is no correlation. Empowerment is you as a person. Inclusion isn’t you as a person, inclusion is bigger than that the way I see it. Like individual empowerment and inclusion, everything is inclusion, inclusion, inclusion but empowerment is up to you. If you want to go out there, the company gives me, if you want to empower yourself there are the tools, it is how you make use of the tools that is going to empower you. Inclusion can be a state of mind or it could be the value add that makes you inclusive, but it is nothing to do with empowerment.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  263P26: Not in my specific field, no (no relationship to inclusion). It sort of outweighs one another sometimes where your level of empowerment where you are the only person that perform this specific task or know it well. It gives you your own sense of personal achievement but within my specific field it doesn’t include you  P27: I don’t see a relationship actually.  P29: I think the empowerment levels is quite high but I don’t think it has anything to do with inclusion?  P37: It is quite fine it doesn’t affect me.  P38: Again, it just, if you are empowered to run with things you know how best to do, I think, I am not sure whether that just, I can’t see a direct correlation between the two. It does make me feel more empowered which is one particular feeling on its own. I am not seeing the link to inclusion though.   There is a relationship between engagement and perception of inclusion  P 1: I am very engaged and I think your engagement will tie in with your inclusion. It does. If you are committed, it all ties into everything, if you want to be committed, do the extra hours, you will feel included in everything.  P 2: I do think the level of engagement with my manager increases my level of feeling included in the company.   P 3: I would say that engagement is good. It certainly helps positively with inclusion.   P 4: I think it makes them feel excluded especially if they don’t understand the operation because they don’t think this guy is not interested in us, and ask how we are doing.  P 6: I feel very included in my work, I feel especially that there is no better feeling than if you got your crew, they know what to do, they do it well without you standing behind them having to say if you don’t then they become as committed you are. Even more so, infact they drive their part just as hard as you drive yours. It liberates you so much more than being a watchdog on jobs.   P 6: There is, definitely (a relationship between engagement and inclusion). You can be part of a group and never feel engaged. You still feel like an outsider. People will tell you I stand in a room filled with people and I still feel alone. That is because they are not being engaged by the group.  P 7: I think it is high, um I know my job pretty well and I very close to my job, he knows what I do on a daily basis and I know what he is doing on a daily basis. I’ve got a good understanding of what I need to do everyday, what my role involves. Because I have a good understanding of that is makes me feel included as well. Yes, there is a relationship between engagement and inclusion.  P12: It is a bit of a difficult question. I’ve had 6 line managers since I’ve started. One for 2 weeks, then another for a month, then another for a month, now this one but soon it will be a new manager again. But I am not afraid to ask. I am able to speak to my line managers fairly frankly and openly.  I am able to communicate with them all on the level. And obviously that very fact helps that you are included. That you don’t need to hide certain things, or you are not asked things from an inclusion point of few. It helps a lot that I did that because I feel included. The confidence to say that this is not the right thing.   Positively, I feel more included.  P13: My levels of engagement with my manager are incredibly high which has a positive effect on my inclusion. From my experience, when I was in another department I had a terrible relationship with my line manager and in terms of inclusion had the opposite effect to the way I feel now with my current line manager.  P13: My engagement with my work is probably moderate at the moment because I am trying to decide a way forward in my career and so in terms of inclusion it depends on what I am doing whether I am feeling included or not. If it is something to do with the team inclusion levels are high but if it is for the business it is not as high as it could be.   P14: Affects it quite well because wherever there is a problem I can go to my manager and say there is a problem. Open door policy, always been like that. This makes me feel more included.  P20: I am too engaged because I know what to do on a daily basis and I know what time I am going to be done and what I am going to be doing at this time and that makes me feel included  P21: It (engagement) can only result in a better relationship with the people you work with because you understand people better, you are comfortable within that space. It is great.  P23: Yes, in relation to him, yes, I felt excluded. There were some people in the team who had different relationship with him.   P23: I don’t know if it was their personalities or what. I felt in relation to them excluded because I didn’t have that engaged relationship with him.  P24: Sometimes I feel excluded because of the challenges I mentioned earlier on.  P27: Very included because the department as a whole I think we are a great community, we are very close with each other, we understand each other’s problems and it makes me feel included when your line manager understands your level also where you are, what problems you are having, makes you feel included having a strong line manager.  P29: The relationship between inclusion and my engagement. I think so ya, the thing is if you are not very involved, how can you be part of something. There is a link ya.   P32: I believe they would be more included if they are more engaged in the matter.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  264P34: Yes definitely. (relationship between engagement and inclusion)  P35: I am very involved with my work. I think with my manager I can go there and ask him whatever I need to and whenever I need to but he has got enough stuff of his own going on unfortunately and he is very stressed  P35: I probably would. (feel excluded if we weren't engaged)  P36: I think the good relationship definitely works to the positive, if there can be an open discussion.  P37: Definitely. It is a definite barrier if the relationship is not to the extent you want it to be where you can be open and transparent in all ways and have that open relationship with your manager. So then you  exclude yourself because of your own reasons, you would exclude yourself.   P38: It does good for my perception of inclusion because I have that consistent communication with my manager. I do feel I am being involved in decisions all the time.   P40: Very engaging all the time, we chat every day, almost like a husband and wife team we chat every day about personal stuff and work stuff so fantastic relationship. I am feeling very included there.   P41: Very well ya.(engagement relates to inclusion)   P42: Yes. I think so. (I would feel less included if I was less engaged) P43: Yes. (there is a relationship)  Code: There is no relationship between engagement and individual perception of inclusion.  P 2: Because the level of engagement with your work is low, does it make you feel less included? No, but it doesn’t make me feel more included.   P 5: It doesn’t (affect how included I feel). That is up to the individual. If you decide you want to sit in the corner and just do my thing then that is what you will do.  P 8: No. (I don't think that my level of engagement affects my inclusion)  P 9: I think I have grown a lot, learnt a lot. Am a very quick learner and enjoy a challenge. I definitely think my levels have increase from my old job to my new one, I have learnt a lot and just amazing how much information is out there and getting to know more about the business. Previously you work at this company but you don’t know anything else about it so ya, definitely my levels have increased a lot and that plays quite a bit with inclusion. Personally I also think it shouldn’t whether you are top level management or the pleb at the bottom you still contribute. Your levels shouldn’t depend on your inclusion. I don’t think there is a relationship between engagement and inclusion.  P10: In my personal circumstances I am fine with it (working in remote site away from the boss). I can work without having someone watch over me, I actually prefer it. I prefer to be independent. Give me something to do and I will do it. I don’t feel excluded because I don’t have someone sitting here watching me. As long as I know what I have to do and when it needs to be done by then I don’t feel excluded.  P10: Not with work, but with functions as I have said before. From a personal level I don’t go to all the functions, I don’t go to all the drinking and pub after work. From that extent you possibly could feel a bit excluded but for me that is not an issue. It doesn’t bother me if they exclude me from that. But I think it is an issue probably females, maybe generalising, females don’t always want to sit after work and drink with the guys. But I don’t feel excluded because of it.  P16: No, I don’t think there is a relationship (between engagement and inclusion) because now this is around what I actually do on a day to day basis. What I do on a day to day basis is I am actually fully accountable and responsible. I cannot easily blame for not including me except for myself.   P17: We get on quite well. Whatever she doesn’t know I know; and whatever I don’t know - she knows. We actually balance each other out. this doesn't affect my inclusion.   P18: I am comfortable in it (my feeling of inclusion). I am happy, have no problems.  Less engagement would not make me feel less included.  P19: I would say medium (engagement with my work). There is no relationship with inclusion for me.  P20: I don’t know because I empowered myself nobody said you must do this or that. I went to them and I want to learn this and they said you can do it in your spare time. I don’t think I would blame anyone. I don't think there is a relationship.  P25: I think in terms of work and levels of work, I am a bit disengaged at the moment. Not that I am not getting things done, I am just disengaged because I am bored. My level of engagement with my manager is fine, no issues there, I say what I need to say, I feel respected for that but sometimes I do know my manager, I can see how she cringes at some of the things I say but it is obviously like when I say things to her and she says, I can’t believe you said that! It doesn’t actually affect my feelings of inclusion or exclusion in any way.  P26: I come from a different background. My manager that I have now has been here 4 months so to me personally I don’t need to be included by him.  P26: No. (there is no relationship between my level of engagement and my inclusion)  University of Cape TownAppendix D  265P33: It hasn’t really affected it (my inclusion) because I am still giving what I need to give to work so there hasn’t been like a drastic change of not living up to what you are supposed to.   Code: There is a relationship between fairness and perception of inclusion  P 2: I do think there is a relationship between being treated fairly and being included  P 2: the consistency links to fairness, which would link to inclusion.  P 4: Yes, they feel like they are not included as such when those decisions are being made to a point where there was some resistance in cooperating when it comes to risk and safety stuff. They are thinking they are given a rope to hang themselves.   P 4: when there is a perception of fairness people feel included and when there isn’t, then they feel excluded.  P 5: If someone was treated unfairly do you think they would feel excluded.  Ya, sure  So there is a relationship? For sure.  P 6: it makes me feel excluded (being treated unfairly), that I am not part of a group, I am separate and should be treated separately. This excludes you from another group.   P 7: Yes, I do. Ya I think so, I think goes pretty much hand in hand. It is quite closely linked. I feel I am treated fairly.  P 8: Yes. I do feel I am treated fairly and that definitely makes me feel included.  P10: Yes, I think so. (there is a relationship between inclusion and fairness)  P10: When I say included I mean every one gets treated the same. So from an inclusion aspect, yes. What is good for one is good for the other. Compensation perspective we have always had an issue here with it from a fairness perspective, but I think they are doing something about it  P13: I’m going to answer yes, but lately there have been experiencing things which I am not sure are fair or not so I have been sitting with a struggle. If it relates to inclusion, I’m starting to recognise that the business has it’s own agenda. If you are in the inner circle you are fine, but if you are not in there you need to fight harder.   P13: I am getting the feedback that I am high potential and they are sure I can do the job reasonably well but I can’t get the job because I am not equity. So is that not fair. So in terms of inclusion I am fitting into the team but not into the great organisation because I am white basically.  P13: Well it kinda almost puts me in the outer circle, do you know what I mean? it does make me feel less included.   P16: Me being treated fairly all comes from the fact that I felt I wasn’t included. I cannot think of any other thing that was one of the most worrying factors in my career or my role here other than the fact that it had to do more with being included and been given, being empowered. I felt being empowered means you are included. So empowerment and inclusion have a direct partnership. Most of it had to do with me feeling with not being included.   P18: Yes, being treated fairly makes me feel more included just as being treated unfairly makes me feel excluded.   P19: Yes, it does make you feel less included but it depends on yourself. I come to work for my family.  P20: As soon as you feel you are treated fairly you feel included, only when there is something else is there a different story.  P21: It is great. (relationship between fairness and inclusion)  P26: Yes. (I feel less included because I am not treated fairly)  P27: It makes me feel more include because people know they can rely on me, they will ask me to do things. It is bad of me not to be able to say no sometimes but it has a great sense of inclusion when people ask me to do something because they know that I can do it. So its contributes positively towards inclusion.  P29: If you are not treated fairly you won’t feel accepted and you wont feel there is respect so ya.   P30: I was ready to go (when I saw the unfairness). Not entirely but I felt that my role and I wasn’t happy in it and I saw a different type of management coming in which doesn’t respond to my personality type which if I was in a role which I loved I would overcome that. But being in a role that I didn’t particular enjoy then have a management style which clashed with mine I didn’t feel happy or included.  P32: Mostly yes I would say I am treated fairly. I have lost that word now. Inclusion. When I am treated fairly I am included. When I am treated fairly I am included.  P32: Ya some of them ya there are other guys that don’t feel the same as I do, that don’t feel included, but personally I feel included on being treated fairly.  P34: My feeling of inclusion is in the team here, I will always feel included here because I am part of a group team. Our motto is to be the best. If you do something wrong in my eyes I will tell you but because our guys working with me is they are still living in the old times, University of Cape TownAppendix D  266they are scared to say something to each other. But I will tell him in front of everyone so we can feel part of the team so he can relate back to me if I do something wrong.   P35: Obviously if you are not treated fairly you wouldn’t want to belong and you would have feelings of resentment.  P37: Yes, there is a definite relationship with that. (inclusion and fairness)  P38: Well I think if one member in the team felt they weren’t being treated fairly you would feel that you are being excluded, or someone is being too harsh on you so that relates back to inclusion  P38: So the relationship is that the individual has to feel they are being treated fairly, if they don’t feel they are treated fairly they will feel that an individual may be harsh or they have not been given the same opportunities. Firstly they will feel they are not being included and secondly they will be more reluctant to actively include them selves in whatever is on the go. The person has to be comfortable within themselves and feel they are being treated at all times.   P40: Absolutely.(that fairness relates to inclusion) But that is a recent thing. We used to be very excluded.   P41: I feel less included, more than less included I imagine. Each and every time, if I make an example with the thing I have done.  P42: I think everyone wants to be treated fairly and when you feel you are treated fairly you feel included. I do feel I am treated fairly.    Code: There is no relationship between fairness and perception of inclusion  P 1: I don’t think it does relate, I don’t think fairness and inclusion relate to each other.  P 5: I don’t know. I don’t think they really go together (fairness and inclusion). It is just up to the individual to be mature about the situation. I haven’t seen a situation where someone was treated really unfairly because we are all treated the same. We are sort of consistent. When I took over people, the one thing I was told was be consistent.   P 9: Oh yes, I have a very good manager that supports me, he has also laid down the rules very clearly in the team. I will do the things if I have time, if they have to wait a bit them I tell them. but I don’t think it really makes a difference to my inclusion.  P12: I feel that I am treated fairly in general. How it relates to my inclusion, it is difficult to answer, I don’t know. Because I do feel included.  I am treated fairly, it has some degree of influence, not really much.   P17: I was very disappointed and I got over it (unfairness). It didn't make me feel excluded.  P21: No (I don't think there is a relationship between being treated fairly and inclusion). I think speaking generally you may be an outsider or not fit in within the group but when it comes to working in a team, people should be treated fairly regardless of whether I like you or I don’t like you or whether I feel you fit in or don’t fit in. There should be an equal treatment of all regardless of .. so not necessarily no.  P22: I am probably one of those strange individuals that would sa  very much of what happens to us we bring about ourselves so I don’t know.  P23: I have never been treated unfairly because I am female or because I am white, actually no there was one instance. Generally feeling I haven’t felt excluded. I did feel unfairly treated when I applied for a position that was targeted for equity only. But I understood the reasons but I still felt unfairly treated, my rational, my emotional response.   P23: I get the sense that I have been treated fairly because I have delivered what needed to be delivered, I don’t feel a link between inclusion and fairness. And maybe because I fit but I have felt because people trust me and because I deliver and I do what I say I am going to do people’s response to me is a fair response. So it has never had a link with inclusion or lack of inclusion.  P25: It is quite easy to exclude someone who if you look at the site for example people at the leadership team are mostly male, two females, from that perspective you can easily feel excluded because sometimes they will talk guy things, but it doesn’t bother me because I sometimes chirp in with them. If you are not the type of person to adapt to a situation then yes it would make you feel excluded when they do chirp and make fun and go on like boys go on but it doesn’t actually make me feel excluded.  P34: No. (relationship between fairness and inclusion)  Code: I identify with my team members and it affects perception of inclusion  P 2: I mean I do think identify with my team members and the example is that say team members that have kids and being able to talk about those kind of things does make me feel more included.   P 7: So no clicks, but there are a few that I identity with and can relate with and chat to on a daily basis even and that makes me feel included. I’ve got a few people that I identify with and relate to.   P 8: I think with the sense of belonging with this team I think it can improve. It is not great but it is OK, it can get better. I think if it is great then the level of inclusion would be better as well. Probably the same with the ability to identify with them.  P 9: How do they see me in a team? Honest and I am very hard working, I work to deadlines, if someone needs something they know they can rely on me. They are not scared to come and ask me, it makes me feel included.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  267P10: I do identify with them, we have a lot of the same problems getting solutions to the problems together does make me feel included because we are all facing the same issues. So I do identify with them and the issues they are going through.   P16: Within my scope or the boundaries of my responsibility, ya (I feel more included).   P18: If you don’t identify with people and you are sitting in one corner you will feel less included in the team. You will. You just want to get your way now or you want the day to be over that you can go or whatever.   P19: More I will explain to you why. (this impacts on my inclusion because...) Whenever we have a problem we solve it. Not a problem that we will go to management, we can talk about it and discuss it, not only from my point of view but from the other point of view too.  P21: (relates) Positively to inclusion.  P25: I do identify with my team members, we have similar issues and problems from a work perspective, I generally feel included, it is not an issues, we often bounce things off one another and it is oh ya remember I went through that same thing not so long ago and so no, it is not an issue.  P26: Yes. ( I feel excluded)  P26: I feel isolated. (impact on inclusion)  P27: If you are the only person then it makes you hard to feel included but if your team members are with you, it might not happen to your team members but they support you it definitely makes you feel included.    P28: Also comes down to knowing each other personally so you get accepted, not accepting someone from the work level but a more personal level so I think it does boil down to you feel included in that way if you can relate to them.  P29: Exactly ya. (even though I don't identify with them I still feel high inclusion)  P30: The better you can get on with people the more you enjoy the interaction with them and the more you feel a part of what you are doing. If you don’t really get on with them, you talk less to them, have less engagement and feel isolated from the team.  P30: Ya, more isolated, less included.  P32: I feel much more included. (because I identify with my team)  P36: Ya(it relates to my inclusion), again it makes me feel there is more to the work than just doing the work and then you feel that you are part of something bigger.  P38: I suppose we work in diverse environments. It (inclusion) helps me appreciate we are all individuals and we do all have the opportunity to input fairly and equally as well into certain things so it is good to see different people are awarded the same opportunity. Different people form different walks of life being awarded the same opportunities. That makes me feel that I do work in an environment that does include us.   P39: Yes (it influences inclusion) because you can pick up quickly by in terms of what they communicate.  P42: Yes definitely. (if I didn't identify with them I would feel less included)  P43: Yes. (I identify well with them and it relates well to my inclusion)  Code: There is no relationship between identifying with my team members and my perception of inclusion  P24: No. to identify with someone isn’t being inclusive it is empathise. You can sympathize with someone but that doesn’t mean they are included in your circle. Simple. That is called how can you say, courteousness, sense of a person. I can empathise if you are going through a bad patch but that doesn’t mean I will be included in everything you are doing.   P29: Not really. That is what makes it a unique situation. I don’t really identify with any of them but we have a very good relationship. We come from totally different backgrounds and cultures but we have very nice relationships. That is why I said when I first came here I thought it would be a bit difficult but absolutely not. The people are very nice. It comes with how you treat people, if you treat them, you don’t mind what race they are then they give you the same back.  Code: Diversity and inclusion in your individual goals?  P 3: No.  P 5: No.  There is a social system entrenched in our goals, in everyone’s goals. So maybe a part of it. There is an opportunity there.  P 7: Not at the moment, No. But it is in my mind though.   P 8: It should be  P 9: No, diversity and inclusion is not in my goals. University of Cape TownAppendix D  268P13: No, but it should be.   P18: To be honest, no.   P21: I must say it is not.  P22: No. I don’t think so.  P25: No. Besides the employee forums. No, they are actually, I can’t remember actually. I am sure there is one, yes there is one.  P26: No.  P27: I don’t have individual goals yet  P29: No, not really.   P30: No.  P32: I haven’t thought about it.  P35: No.  P36: No, it is not.  P37: I don’t think so. I don’t think we have discussed it.   P40: It is not written out in black and white but part of the way I live my life  P43: Ya, no, not in my individual goals.   Code: Yes, Diversity and Inclusion is in my individual goals  P 2: It is more in terms of the employee forum that would drive diversity and inclusion.  P 4: Yes.  P 5: You are responsible for your own goals and own development.  P 6: Yes, it is in our goals. I want to include as many people as possible.  P14: Yes.  P16: It is in my goals.   P19: Yes I would say yes.  P23: Yes.  P24: Yes, because your goals give you direction, give you value, give you a sense of purpose and that is what it is.  P24: Yes. In everything we do.  P39: I think yes, because what we have got is to ensure that everyone is on the same level.  P42: Yes.   P42: I think in our team in the team goals it is more like we should work towards cohesion and inclusion of everyone, part of being included. Not sure how to put it as a goal but there is something like that. Also trying to learn other people’s languages because that makes everyone feel included. People are interested in me as a person or a certain race or group. That effort.    Code: Access to information and information networks do not affect my perception of inclusion  P 5: It doesn’t (affect my inclusion). I don’t see they are related at all. I am one of those people that think if you want something badly enough you must just get it. I don’t make it someone else’s problem.  P12: No, No barring (information networks on my inclusion) because it wouldn’t have made me feel less or more if I did ya.   P23: I think my answer is no.  The only time I would have felt excluded would be where there were conversations that I wasn’t privy to because it was in the pub which goes back to what I said earlier. It wouldn’t be that people are trying to exclude me because I have never experienced that but they would have known sooner.  P23: No. It hasn't make me feel less included. (information sharing)  University of Cape TownAppendix D  269P25: No because I understand why certain people have access to certain information and other people don’t.  P25: No I don’t feel excluded and I know the exclusion that there is, is for a specific purpose.  P38: people in my position that operate out of some sites* do seem to have access to more information but I think that is just because there are less physical barriers. Not that I feel exclusion because of that, it is just a positional thing, if I was over there and you are running into people in the corridors I think it is easier to get information out of them because you have more of a relationship with them. I think they do have more accesses to information but I don’t feel excluded as a result of that. I understand the context of that.  Code: Access to information and information networks affect my perception of inclusion  P 1: I won’t have as much interaction and make people feel included but then again I have the info in my head so I have a lot of people asking me about stuff. That is cool.   P 2: for me I think that relates to fairness because if I felt that other people were getting different levels of information my perception of the fairness would alter my levels of inclusion.   P 4: It is positive (impact on inclusion) because whenever you need the information you can get it. If you had to ask me a certain number of anything, I think the turn around time would be 10 minutes.  P 4: if you didn't have that information then you would feel excluded in the sense that it would take longer to get anything going. Now because that information is at your finger tips it makes it quite easy.  P 6: Yes I do, I do (feel excluded from information networks). I um I feel distressed. First information does not get dissemined to me. I am not sure if this is because of shift work or because that’s why um I feel some of the information passes me by. I hear about it after the fact. This definitely makes me feel excluded.   P 7: I think a lack of this information would make me excluded because it is part of my role.   P 8: Yes I would have (felt less included if I did not have access to information).  P 9: There are 11 people in the same job as me, if one seems to find something new they send it to all the others, they share. So we feel very included amongst the people of same titles. Being included here in my site we are included in meetings on Tuesday which previously we weren’t so you never knew what your job was for, definitely more included with that.  P11: Well I am glad to have it (information), it helps me a lot so once again I am glad I have it.  P11: It is difficult to say less included (if I didn't have it) because obviously I can’t perform my work without it so if I didn’t have it I would be sitting there, not knowing what to do because all my stuff is run on email. So I would say yes it would make me feel less included.  P13: I think I have more access to information than other people in my same position and it gives me a very positive experience of inclusion, makes me feel like important and um kind of worthy of that information which is a positive.  P16: If there was restricted access to that type of information that differentiates me from my colleagues then I certainly would feel excluded.  Now that the platform if there and everyone can access the information freely then it is fine.   P20: It would make me feel excluded if I didn't have the information I need. If there is someone else in the dept who can have them, who has the same job title as me, so why can’t I.  P22: Not an easy question to answer. I would say maybe yes (I am more included because of my network).   P24: No, I sometimes think I get included more. I am being serious.   P26: I do yes (feel excluded because I don't have access to the information)  P27: so if I didn’t have the information I would definitely feel excluded because it is required, you need the information in order to do your daily job or speak about your company or discuss something.  P27: I have got more than enough information to feel included.   P29: Oh yes, definitely (you would feel excluded if you didn't have access to information) . Say for example some people that have access to internet and intranet or something and I don’t have it you would feel discriminated.   P32: Exactly I feel much more included now that I can get that information.  P37: Yes, definitely (I would feel less included if I had less information) Information is huge as far as I am concerned. The more information the more decisions you can do.   P37: Positional power, it is not really relevant here to a certain extent which is not always a good thing. The levels are very vague at the site* right now and positional power, actually you are right, there is, but then it goes again to the hierarchy that you were talking about in terms of making decisions and not being included in those levels of decisions. So ya it does affect. There it goes to  what information you receive from certain people at certain levels so it could affect my inclusion  P39: Ya, probably yes. If we are basing decisions on certain information received and you are not included then it could have that feeling. (of exclusion)  P40: We are excluded to a certain degree because we aren’t close enough to the hub of the business. University of Cape TownAppendix D  270P41: Ya it is related to inclusion. In some issues here, not each and every issue. There are some issues that are not transparent here  P42: But if it was a once off thing they probably asked that specific question and got a specific answer. So he becomes aware of it so I didn’t ask and so I don’t have the information. But if it is a couple of things I would feel excluded.  P43: Positively as well (to inclusion)  Code: Perception of managers and inclusion  P11: A manager is there to actually maintain a balance of work, obviously he has to throw weight around to get stuff done. If he isn’t hard on people then the people will do their own thing. They need to be hard.   P13: I think my relationship with my line manager and the team are the two things that make me feel most included.   P25: Style of management has a huge impact on the feeling of inclusion or exclusion.   P25: But autocratic in a shouting way, one can be autocratic and be nice about it, look I would like you to do this, this is how I want it done and do it by this date. But the way he has gone about it is do it and don’t ask any questions. So I think yes the people who aren’t performing are feeling the pressure but it is also puts a whole new flavour to the district. People are afraid to speak.  P25: if you speak out of turn you get a fine. I have never heard anything such crap in my life. I asked what do you mean, no you get a R20 fine if you ask a stupid question. So does that mean while I talk everyone else must be quiet - that sucks. We must engage one another not just sit there. That is the way he chooses to manage.   P25: there are individuals who have lots of potential and we are crushing it by the way we manage and we are excluding them. These people are waiting to run, that is all they want to do. The other side of it is the trust issues where we are typically a high trust organisation I think when the style of management changes the trust goes  P25: You have to start all over again, not good for the district to have all these changes. Now there is  new guy coming and people are apprehensive about this new guy and his style. I think some of the managers from a sales perspective are totally disengaged and so people are not coping and when people don’t cope they move on. People who have chooses leave.  It will be interesting times when the new boss comes.   P27: Different levels, my manager I am very open and honest, she can tell me what I need, I can tell her if it is too much work, I can give her comments or observations we are very open and honest with each other, it is a good thing. Sometimes I have a tendency to not be able to say no but she can sense that. She knows I must do this and this I can’t handle anything else she will do it herself or find someone else to do it. So she is very understanding. Fantastic boss I have.   P27: Very included because the department as a whole I think we are a great community, we are very close with each other, we understand each other’s problems and it makes me feel included when your line manager understands your level also where you are, what problems you are having, makes you feel included having a strong line manager.  Code: understanding the need for diversity and inclusion   P 1: my company makes you feel included make you feel like family but then they take your life and they really own it. The flip side to this is that we are not included, work is work and there is nothing other than work we come here 8 - 5   P 3: Yes, Um, you know we are all going trying to achieve common business goals and you want to work in an environment where everyone is respected for their views.   P 4: Depends on generation. Generation by generation you are used to a certain style so yes. 60% of organisational people will say they are willing to accommodate diversity and inclusion but I think there is still a long way to go. Still some elements where you can say we are not there yet.   P 5: Maybe we don’t hear about it often enough  P 5: For instances two weeks ago the HR manager came to us and spoke about the sexual harassment policy. Things like that are good. In every day life you forget about things like that even if you want to raise a concern, you don’t know where to start  P 5: Things like that are important, things that disappear in the bigger scheme of things that you keep reminded. Even if it is like a mail to say whatever once in a while so it is fresh in people’s minds. Not something we are totally ignoring. Highlighting in people’s minds because if you don’t hear anything about it you get the idea no one cares.    P 6: Absolutely (there is a genuine need for diversity and inclusion). I think that without diversity we are going not only backwards not just as a society, but I think we are going backwards as people. If you are not prepared to accept that there is so much you can learn from other cultures, people, other ways of thinking, other ways of speaking. So much you can learn. And If you close your eyes and want to go into a shell where it is just me and mine, it’s pointless you stagnate and you die. All living things must go forward.   P 7: Everyone should feel included regardless of what gender, age or race they are. So I think everyone should be given a fair opportunity and be given a chance to make their voices heard and make the right decisions and be involved with the company in every kind of way.I think that the company handles it well, my personal opinion. You can see it by looking around, there is a spectrum of ages, races, religion, cultures and it seems that everyone gets along and everyone is accepted.   P 8: Yes I think there will always be. Something that you will always have to work on, you can always take it to a higher level.  lets say this week something happens to a specific person or a team that makes them feel less included or impacts on their level of inclusion, so how University of Cape TownAppendix D  271they feel while that is happening versus two months ago or two months later. I am thinking there could be that differing levels. Always something that you constantly have to be working on to raise that level.   P 9: Yes, I think everyone must be represented, race, gender. That is why with the female, male ratio I feel a lot of females don’t feel that included in the company because the positions always go to males.   P11: I do think so. Obviously everyone wants to be part of the team, everyone wants to be included in the team, just to know you are part of something, one happy family.   P12: yes, definitely. because we live in a diverse country and each one has their own special ingredient to put into the put and together we make a nicer curry.   P13: At the moment in our business it’s going to be thrown to deaf ears because our business is so busy worrying about volumes that we missing the fact that we have issues with our people. I don’t think that diversity and inclusion is the only thing that will fall on deaf ears but it will be one of the stereotypical HR things that is not being rolled out by central office, but I do think it has it’s place?  P14: Yes, because we are all different and come from different cultures and backgrounds. We need to embrace each others cultures.   P16: On Fridays when I address my team and I actually ensure in my address that I preach respect for one another’s cultures, traditions, background. Just because a person who doesn’t have matric is less important than you who has a degree. You have people who are Muslim who are working in the same environment, those people mocked by others who are not Muslim, tackled on religion. Religion places a lot of division. It is very important for business to invest in diversity.  P17: I think in all companies there are people of different cultures and races and genders. I mean we can’t just have all Whites, or all Blacks or all Indians. It’s actually interesting. You can learn about people from different cultures.  P18: Maybe, I think you should have diversity.  P19: Not actually, there is enough. Whatever comes.   P20: Yes.  People need to be taught. This company has their own values, people need to follow that. We doesn’t say you must ill treat others. You must follow the norms and values of the company.  P21: Definitely. What a boring world it would be if we were all the same. Even in the work environment it brings colour, life, different personalities, understanding how different people will think or react to situations, I think you need different personalities even in the work that we do.   P22: I think you used the term diversity meaning A and inclusion meaning B. I don’t think the difference, I don’t think that people understand those things the way people understand those things. You talk about equity being a target kind of thing whereas inclusion is something bigger. I go back to what I said at the beginning I often have a problem with what people talk about they say equity. I say equity what, do you want to optimise it, maximise it, embrace it all of that kind of stuff. I go back to what I said previously, I think people need to take ownership, that is easier said than done. You have to go and make your space and it is easier said than done, you have to be tough and take ownership of making sure you belong.  P23: I think there is a turnover crisis at the moment it is in our area, but not only in our area. If you look at the people who are leaving and consistently over the years the people who have left because they didn’t fit properly. If we opened our eyes a bit wider as to how we could have accommodated those people they may have stayed. I think it is personality based often. So the manager’s relationship with the individual affects whether he fits or not  P24: We don’t need it, it is already in. It is surrounded by. But you definitely need it.  P24: I can go to the history in the past we weren’t included in a lot of things, now we are included, but to get along as people, not as colour, race creed, you need inclusion. Need diversity because if we all thought the same and did the same it would be boring. Inclusion and diversity makes us dynamic. In everything, not just work. Diversity and inclusion is just there.  P25: And people might feel excluded because of that and we have compartmentalised it like that so I think there is a need for us to recognise we are different and that within the working environment we need to tolerate those differences and respect them and not necessarily agree with in terms of their background, their upbringing, their culture believes. But I do think people don’t talk about it because they are afraid so everyone says it is oK.  P25: It is because we don’t want to go there, we turn a blind eye and say it isn’t an issue but it is an issue. Because people wont say that every year if they don’t feel that way. So I seriously believe that there is a need.  P26: Yes, I do because the majority of our day, life we are at work and it is not just weekdays, it is weekends so people talk about the balance but we are here most of the time. It needs to happen so that we can move freely, work passionately. Otherwise people get into this frame of mind, then people are not so accepting of change.   P27: Well, if there wasn’t included in diversity of modules or whatever things would get out of hand because people won’t listen to what you say or you would feel left out. Because you feel left out you may not do your job properly or you might misuse the company or lots of things could go wrong so it is definitely required. It makes a big difference in the company if you feel included. You grow faster.  P28: Definitely it boils down to being accepted and the more diversity you can grow from other people and what they bring to the plate, how you are diversity is important for a company especially if they are going global.   P29: No. I don’t see a need for that.  Diversity is good but for inclusion it is not necessary.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  272P29: Diversity I don’t feel you need a lot of different kind of people to be included.  I think it is not necessarily who the people is or where they come from it is basically how the different people or same type of people interact with each other in community or team. That is basically, I don’t think diversity has anything to do with it.   P30: I think looking at the history of the country there are a lot of old attitudes remaining about who should be where and I think it is a really great system to have in place where we all feel equal to each other. Not necessarily  directly, it is a very indirect process they have adopted. I don’t know how they have managed to do it so well. I haven’t worked in any other companies to be able to compare it to but I think we have a great group of diversified people here.  P31: I think there is. Inclusion more.  P32: I think I do feel like that. There is a genuine need.  P33: Absolutely, I am not saying absolutely in a bad way but in general we need to be more conscious of the diversity here. I wouldn’t say there is exclusion but inclusion should be a focus. All should be included in whatever way.   P34: I think we need that so we can have trust.  P35: I think it exists but I think it is important but there are little things like conflict that can make people feel excluded. I think people are discriminated against and that is why they are excluded.   P36: Ya, I think it is very important, the inclusion aspect is definitely important. People aren’t machines, we don’t operate in a vacuum so that people need to, some more than others, but there is a need to be part of a team or acceptance so without inclusion being deliberately done, I think it would be more difficult to have a happy engaging workforce. Diversity is also important because different people with different backgrounds, different upbringing, there are so many different ways to describe diversity but it means there are a lot of perspectives around issues and a lot of different ways of engaging and makes it, there is a lot more to learn more from each other, able to be more powerful if people are able to bring in different strengths.    P37: There is a huge need. If you can breach that gap of diversity it affects different things, it doesn’t affect the professional area of oneself, it affects your morals, your values, your emotions and those things. The good part then you would feel much more included and have a more preferably work experience.   P37: I don’t know where this is going to, hopefully it will add value to our lives. Yes, diversity is a fact of life and we need to keep driving it, we drove it for certain reasons a few years ago because of the way the country has changed so we felt we need to drive it from that but we have moved away from that. The dust has settled and the need has decreased in people’s minds but there is still a great divide over there and we must do whatever we can, we shouldn’t stop. Like I said we have stopped doing those interventions for whatever reasons and I think it is very necessary across the different levels, across the different diversities that people get to know the cultures and one another, it adds holistically to your experience.   P38: I suppose we work in diverse environments. It (inclusion) helps me appreciate we are all individuals and we do all have the opportunity to input fairly and equally as well into certain things so it is good to see different people are awarded the same opportunity. Different people form different walks of life being awarded the same opportunities. That makes me feel that I do work in an environment that does include us.   P38: Ya. Absolutely in every organisation needs diversity and inclusion.  P39: Again I think management has done everything to include the guys at shopfloor* but more of a perception from their side. They have been there for 30 yrs so it is very hard to change their perception.   P40: I still find and it is not when we, there is a divide between managers and floor workers. Now without elaborating too much because it is not part of the question but we still have some way to go on inclusion.  P40: The pace of life, the international demands placed on a company, the legal issues have changed the way we do business, you need to keep up with that. Back to the original questions that sometimes polarises people.  P42: we have gone backwards in terms of transforming.  P43: People need to feel accepted and respected in the work force. There should be fear or victimisation because of their colour, their age, their gender, they are here because they qualify to be here and they know what they are doing and they are respected for that. If for any reason they don’t know what they should be doing they need to be informed but without victimisation. It is very important.   Code: There is a relationship between organisation belonging and perception of inclusion  P 2: I think that if I didn’t feel that I belonged in the team my inclusion levels would be impacted.   P 2: my need is to belong to the team and I know that positional power will exist in the company but I don’t think it will impact me or my feeling of inclusion because my immediate need is to be included in the team.  P 3: We all work closely together and I think it is good to have that. I think it does affect inclusion.  P 6: I suppose if you don’t feel you belong you won’t feel included. If you don’t belong in a group don’t force yourself because you don’t want to stand alone. If you don’t belong, you don’t belong. Exclude yourself from the group. Let them think what they want.  P 7: So no clicks, but there are a few that I identity with and can relate with and chat to on a daily basis even and that makes me feel included. I’ve got a few people that I identify with and relate to.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  273P 8: I think with the sense of belonging with this team I think it can improve. It is not great but it is OK, it can get better. I think if it is great then the level of inclusion would be better as well.   Probably the same with the ability to identify with them.  P 9: Belonging also is around acceptance. I think we feel that we belong to, we have a nice tightened team. Not just colleagues. Personal relationship you are building with your colleagues to be friends. Belonging to a group makes you feel included.    P10: Ya (I would been excluded if I didn't belong to a team here) I think it would because then you wouldn’t really belong anyway, just float between here and nowhere  P10: I am included on the management team and get invited to all their events so I think they have gone a long way to making me feel included here.   P13: I think it is probably the number one thing that makes me feel the most inclusion is the positive relationship in the team.  P13: I think my relationship with my line manager and the team are the two things that make me feel most included.   P16: There is a strong correlation because if you feel you are not in touch or you don’t belong to a certain thing that might lead you to conclude you are not included and actually you are excluding yourself. You have felt you don’t belong to a certain environment. Once you start believing you truly belong to the environment, even your attitude towards your role chances completely and yes I think that makes you more of a participatory person. Definite relationship between org belonging and inclusion, a very strong one.    P17: Definitely, I belong and this does affect my inclusion.  P18: Yes I do think you would feel less included. Everybody is not the same, I think so.  You would feel not included, why don’t they include you. You don’t want to be included in everything but certain things.  P19: Yes, I do belong to my team. If I am not here my team will stop. I belong. Team player. This makes me more included.  P20: I am included because I belong to my team. We work together. I feeling included in my team and that I belong.   P21: Positive.(impact on inclusion)  P22: Well I think I belong in the team, I do so your sense of belonging is important. You have to have a sense of belonging.  P23: I feel a huge sense of belonging and feel included as me.  P23: it is a mediocre sense of belonging which makes me think whether I am there or not it is not yeah me the person is part of our team and lets value that. So ya, a lot. (it impacts inclusion)  P23: I don’t feel excluded by the individuals but I don’t feel included by the team. And I think it links back to a team as a unit gives off a whole new message to the sum of the individuals, as a unit it is different.   P26: Yes, I do. (feel less included)  P27: Yes it does, it gives you a sense of belonging because we are all striving towards our own goals and it makes you feel included.  P28: Now I feel a bit more accepted by the team, just the longer you are involved the more included you feel.  P29: Belonging goes hand in hand with inclusion. Belonging is basically if you don’t feel like you belong you are going to feel excluded.  P30: I think a team does mean you should be working together and sharing in your successes and challenges together so. I think we want to feel part of the whole and as a team if you feel you belong to the team you feel you are adding value to that team and their value and ultimate successes. Then you would feel more included. P32: we try to make it one big family and work very nicely with the guys so the sense of belonging it is good with the guys, I feel much more included.  P32: Ya I definitely think so. It would be less. (if there wasn't org belonging)  P33: I think I generally feel excluded like as I said before with my team here, the language factor has been a barrier before.  P35: I think by having a sense of belonging you do feel included.  P36: Helps me to feel part of the team.(impact on inclusion)  P37: Like I said I am self driven to a huge extent so I make sure my relationships are ok regardless of the perceptions or the feelings of others so it doesn’t affect inclusion for me but it could affect other people in general. You spend a lot of time at work and if those are relationships are not what you want them to be then it could impact you negatively.  P38: I think that with belonging comes the acceptance thing again. If this is where I feel I am supposed to do and this is where my input and skills are most valued, I would definitely feel more included or have the opportunity to feel more included.    P39: I think there is definitely a relationship and again for me it is a doubled edged knife when I am saying you have to attend so many other high level items that you don’t really get to be with your team.   P40: Because of the long term service if you know your stuff, ask me. Feel more included.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  274P42: That is important as well because if you feel part of the team you feel included, if part of the team you feel people respect you. Relates to others stuff we have talked about. You want to feel part of the boys, part of the team, you want to feel part of them. They want to belong to something.  P42: Yes. (it relates to my inclusion)  Code: There is no relationship between organisation belonging and perception of inclusion  P11: I wouldn’t say it affects me but nice to know that you are needed, that they think about you.  P12: not really affects it. it is neither positive or negative. I've got my family and friends and know who is important to me. we are a friendly bunch here at work so we get along fine.   P24: No. (org belonging does not affect inclusion)  P25: It doesn’t. (belonging affect inclusion)  Code: Relationship between personality and perception of inclusion  P 4: it relates to personality and you as a person what do you want to achieve. To me if you have the right personality you fit in well into a team. If you know where you want to go you also fit in well into it.  P10: For me that works for from a personal experience. I like to have work and I like my life. For others it is a problem.   P10: Other people accept me for who I am. Call a spade a spade, in some places it probably doesn’t go down very well. I am very much what you see is what you get. Within our team we know each other well enough now that if I say something I am not trying to be malicious, I am just very straightforward. That is me. I don’t believe in beating around the bush. Liked or not liked. Within the team it is fine.  P10: No, I don’t think it does. Important events I will attend, when I do go I do feel included and I do feel part of the team. They don’t make me feel less part of the team because I don’t go to all the functions.   P10: I have friends outside of work so for me to have less friends in work is not an issue. I have friends but from a social aspect it doesn’t phase me.   P10: Ya, for me it is not an issue, I am going to do the work to the best of my ability. I would rather he tell me that he is not happy with what I am doing than to pat me on the back all the time. I think for other people that is important. It is nice to have a thank you, well done every now and then, that does mean a lot, but it doesn’t make me work any less, or feel less engaged, or work any harder. But that is an individual thing. I think a lot of people are motivated than other people.  P12: I am one of the few people that have to step out of a certain shoe and into a certain shoe. It is not good always, but I do it well. I’ve been with the company for a while and I’m going to speak to you frankly. I work hard at prospering at work because of the inclusion thing. That would be my focus point of conversation I think. Because I know I have immense knowledge and experience of what goes on. I’ve learnt a lot also, a strong point but it wouldn’t be my first point of conversation at home. I’ve got other loves, other passions that I would would rather be chatting about than that.  P22: I suppose my personality has never allowed, has been such that I make people include me because I always believe what you allow you teach so I don’t allow people not to include me so I think I always feel included and if I didn’t I would go out of my way to make sure I was because I have that sort of personality.  P22: I wouldn’t allow anyone to treat me unfairly.  P22: You can either stand around and whine about it and that is not me or you can do what you have to do to actually change things and that is me, or you can leave  P22: I am probably one of those strange individuals that would say very much of what happens to us we bring about ourselves so I don’t know.  P22: I don’t know, to me I believe in a couple of things. I believe that people say if you come into organisations and you are forced to assimilate information, you are not forced to do anything  we are not forced to do anything. You need to know who you are, what your values are, where you draw the line and you need to engage people when things are over that line.  P22: I don’t mind if I didn’t hang out in a bar and party until 2am that doesn’t make me feel less included or excluded but that is because of self and who you are.  P22: I suppose I would be passionate about making tea if that was my job.   P26: It doesn’t really impact on it in that I am self assured. I don’t really bother too much about what others are thinking.  P30: I just am. You work with different personality types and be able to read them and probably adjust to certain types but if I am a loud, outgoing person who does things in a certain way I want to be that person all the time unless there is a time and place where it is not appropriate. Or whatever my work ethic is, I work hard, people know that about me and hopefully it will get me places.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  275P33: Um, you know and I am sure I have said this before, one of my mottos in life is you only obligation in your life is to be true to yourself and another one is you can’t please everyone so you have to please yourself. And where I feel excluded I just go on as long as I am being true to myself.   P33: I think it is mostly in decision making. Also certain people are not necessarily approachable and people are scared of them because of 1) their positions and 2) because of their positions and their personalities. People will just kind of sit and not talk to them.   P35: It also depends on your personality type so because I look at my staff and there are a lot of things that would make them feel excluded but then it does depend on their personality, then the other oakes some of them are more extravert, they go out and don’t care if someone didn’t talk to them whereas other people would stand in the corner.  P39: I prefer to work and spend the rest of the time at home.  P39: Probable various from person to person because for me I prefer to be on my own   P40: I am not a hero worshipper so if I don’t need to be included don’t waste my time or yours.  Code: there is a relationship between positional power and perception of inclusion  P 2: my need is to belong to the team and I know that positional power will exist in the company but I don’t think it will impact me or my feeling of inclusion because my immediate need is to be included in the team.  P 4: To me it is negative (positional power), it makes me feel not being included.  P 4: It does relate negatively to my inclusion, that period I was feeling that I am not able to progress in what I want to do. The person using the power is overpowering me in the sense that you are not going in the same direction. So negatively you feel not included.  P 4: If you do things with your own thinking, you feel like you want to come to work again tomorro  because you know you have some powers. If you don’t have any powers to make decision then you wont feel like you are being included, you are just here.  P 5: If it was abused it would affect inclusion. I haven’t had experience of that nature. As I said we try, I try for my team to feel as equal to each other as we all can.   P 6: Shout at people and hang out my window, swear at people then you as the person wielding that power will be excluded from the group. The group doesn’t want you. no one wants Hitler dispite the number of views he had.   P 8: I believe that, if I felt someone is feeling victimised or someone abusing their authority or powers or being on a higher level, it would make me feel less included. This is something I identify as a negative, or something I don’t like, again it is like you build up that divide of that feeling of being included.  P13: I think there is a hell of a lot of position power. Negative positional power. I think this business it plays too heavily on positional power. It impacts negatively for me on inclusion. I think if you are not in certain positions you are almost disempowered.  P16: Gets to a point when decision is taken your view is not considered because of your position.  Makes you feel excluded! P23: I do think people in power make decisions based on their intrinsic view of the world and I think that excludes people and goes back to what I was saying about their subconscious views.   P23: I think of a manager who I don’t think is giving his black managers a fair enough chance. His view was tainted before he started working with them. And his positional power allows him to do that. I don’t think he realises that the people that he is, people who are being targeted for poor performance. If they were white men it would be different, based on my experience. That manager subordinate relationship is powerful in your ability to performance manage people. That is an example where it has been exclusive or not inclusive.   P24: Yes (it does affect my inclusion). Do what I say, don’t do what I do. Person higher up the food chain or line manager who issues something and in that position might not necessarily go with your values but you do it anyway. It is not often but you know the triangle they speak about. You, your values and your outputs, sometimes they don’t speak to each other sometimes you are challenged with that.   P26: A lot. (positional power affects my perception of inclusion)   P27: So I don’t agree with positional power but if there was because I see that as very negative because it is like the power in the higher position will tramp over the person in the lower position because they are more powerful but if there was positional power that someone in a higher position was taking advantage I would say that wouldn’t make someone feel included, it would make you feel excluded because if you are trampled on you are definitely excluded not included.  P32: If a guy is trying to show off about his position I would feel less included in the matter because you won’t really take notice about his employees because he is so busy with his positional power but if he was using it in an appropriate way to get other guys involved, we know that he is our superior but he doesn’t have to be more about it. If you get the guys involved in the matter they have their ideas and views, knowing that you are their superior it won’t change but we have to also be more involved with other guys as well.  P32: I believe they would be more included if they are more engaged in the matter.   P33: We are not there yet. It hampers it.(my inclusion)  P36: If a senior manager* needs something done, it needs to be done now, so it bypasses the systems you have put in place to manage your time and inevitable it means another late night. Pretty much. Then it can be disempowered that there isn’t a respect for your own boundaries. Sometimes positional power does come into play and makes you feel you don’t have a say, just has to be done.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  276P37: Positional power, it is not really relevant here to a certain extent which is not always a good thing. The levels are very vague at the site* right now and positional power, actually you are right, there is, but then it goes again to the hierarchy that you were talking about in terms of making decisions and not being included in those levels of decisions. So ya it does affect. There it goes to  what information you receive from certain people at certain levels so it could affect my inclusion  P38: It affects my position of inclusion quite negatively when individuals do not abuse power but where positional power I think, decisions are made at certain levels that do have a direct impact on how you do your job and your input is not requested. That makes me as an individual in the organisation feel excluded particularly when it is individuals not working or do not have experience in your role who are then taking decisions on your behalf.  P40: It is directly link. (between positional power and inclusion)  P42: If one pulls a lot (of positional power) you feel less included.  Code: There is no relationship between positional power and perception of inclusion  P 7: No (I haven't experienced positional power), and it hasn’t impacted on my feeling of inclusion.  P 9: I must say most of the people here don’t use their positions. I think if you had to abuse that you could definitely feel more included in other circles or networks. (outside of the company) I don’t think any one here has used their power to their advantage. Using their position as a employee a lot of people can be included in a lot wider networks. Within the company no. there is no relationship I can see.  P12: it doesn't really affect my perception of inclusion  P14: I have not had any negative experience of positional power.  P17: I haven’t experienced that  P18: I don’t think it affects me.  P25: I don’t think it affects my feelings of inclusion I just think it is rude. I don’t think it is effective. I tend to loose all respect for them because for me it is not about where you are on the tree it is about who have your brought with you and who looks up to you for being in that position rather than I am the so and so and you will listen to me. I haven’t experienced personally people throwing their weight around. It hasn’t been an issue for me from an inclusion or exclusion perspective.  P29: Not really.(positional power doesn't affect perception of inclusion)  P30: I think there is a very good structure in place in terms of senior people interacting with those more junior to them. I don’t perceive a grand hierarchy where someone is out of reach of your being able to chat to them. I think it is good at this company*. I feel quite happy to talk to managers* whoever they may be.  I don’t feel there are barriers in place. P35: I don’t think anybody abuses their power and even in terms of I don’t think it mattered as to what your position was, everyone felt included   P39: I don’t think in our environment I haven’t experienced people using their positional powers to do anything. But in terms of inclusion I can’t think of anything specific. I can’t see inclusion in that regard.  Code: There is a relationship between recognition and individual perception of inclusion  P 2: I think there is a lot of recognition and that again impacts on that sense of purpose and heightens the sense of purpose. When there is more purpose I feel more included.    P 2: I think there is a lot of acknowledgement in the team particularly what you bring to the team. For example my manager would recognise what you bring to the team, that immediately makes you feel included, it boils down to recognition for what you bring.   P 3: It’s verbal, and I have received an award, and sitting down and getting a performance review. It helps my feeling of inclusion knowing you are performing well.  P 4: As I said in the beginning it is my personality, I am a free person, easy to relate to other people without being reserved or being judgemental. I am being recognised. That makes me feel included.  P 5: Yes (I am recognised). It makes me feel really included. You know negative or positive. Feedback for me is very important.  P 5: If you feel as my superior that this way is not a good idea, maybe we shouldn’t have done it like this, lets learn from the mistake and carry on. I appreciate that. Or if it is good and then that kind of feedback as well to boost my morale and drive, I appreciate that. If there was no honest feedback I would feel excluded. P 6: Yes, the recognition makes you feel more included. You start feeling like people look at your differently. This guy is capable of things, give him something to do. Ask him to do something. give him a call, send him an e-mail.   P 6: You start to feel that your work is really making a difference. Definitely feel more included. P 7: I got a note from one of the managers to say thanks for organising our admin requirements for a this project. We really appreciate your help. He put it in a nicely framed certificate. Just little things like that, you know, it made me feel very included and very appreciated in the business.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  277P 8: Feedback, I get feedback and I like feedback whether it is good or bad. Recognition if it is within the team or customers obviously from my manager, my team here and it definitely makes me feel good and included.  P 9: recognition makes me feel very included.  P12: Yes, very well, surprisingly yes. I just won an award so this is inclusion. it helps a lot, it gives you are warmer feeling   P14: Yes, definitely.(there is a relationship between recognition and inclusion)  P16: As a matter of fact I think there is a very strong relationship between recognition and inclusion. When people are recognised they tend to have a high level of drive and get more motivated to deliver to actually feel they are in the right space and moving in the right direction,  P16: It makes them feel more valued and also to deliver outstanding results that is why there is a strong relationship between inclusion and recognition.  P18: It makes you feel good. He gives you a pat on the back, he always comes and says you are doing a good job. He makes you feel good, you feel included, you are doing something.  P19: Well he is not always the bright guy but he will give you your due. It makes me feel more included.  P20: Because you won’t feel included if you don’t feel recognised.  P23: It has made me feel included in that my performance was rewarded. SO my input is high performance individual was acknowledged and awarded. That relationship is inclusive. You perform you get rewarded. I didn’t feel unincluded or unfairly treated.  P25: Recognition comes through thank yous and performance reviews and as a team we have been recognised for our work.  P26: Terrible because you feel as though what you do is taken for granted, like you are being used.(negative relationship to inclusion- makes me feel less included)  P27: It is a pat on the back and that makes you feel included because they are recognising what I am doing. Some of the people are going through, forgetting about my boss and coming straight to me so it makes me feel included in the sense that sometimes people come directly to me, they know that I can do that and that they can rely on me. I like the fact that people can rely on my for what they want.  P27: It (recognition) influences inclusion tremendously.  P27: if I did all of these things and no one  noticed, it is going to help the business but no one can see it, or somebody has used my information and got recognition for themselves, it makes a big difference because recognition makes you feel included.  P29: The more you are rewarded for what you do I think your, I am not sure if you would feel part of a team or more included. I am not sure if that is a huge difference in how you feel.  Maybe a little bit but not that much. To get reward is nice. P31: You are not included, you are needed. No, you are required, not included.   P35: Because when the feedback is positive then people are more receptive to you and let you feel part of the group. I would say there is a relationship (with inclusion).   P36: It makes me feel like what I am doing is recognised and worthwhile and definitely makes me feel included otherwise I am just sitting in a cubicle and grafting, to what end.   P37: It has a huge impact (on inclusion) because it affects your morale and motivation so you can withdraw to a certain extent and you feel it is unfair.   P42: Yes. (there is a relationship with inclusion)  P43: Very positively.(relates to inclusion)  Code: There is no relationship between recognition and perception of inclusion  P10: I think more recognition would make you feel more included, but it is not an issue from me.  P24: It doesn’t affect it. (my inclusion)  P28: Lesley Ann.rtf - 28:9 [No. (it doesn't relate to incl..]  (106:106)   (Super) Codes:  [Recognition X]  No. (it doesn't relate to inclusion) P38: It doesn’t (affect my inclusion) to be honest with you.   P40: Yes it does (positively affect my inclusion) because my manager* is very good on email he always puts out the rah rah so everyone hears about it and your reputation increases  Code: There is a relationship between respect and perception of inclusion P 3: Well feeling included helps you know, it’s good to feel that your opinion is respected.  P 4: they just welcome you with open arms then you feel you have been included, and they do that with respect, no back chat or resistance.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  278P 5: The fact that I am trusted in my work environment does make me feel included because I don’t feel I am second guessed all the time.  P 6: Religiously I feel excluded. I have very strong views about some things. There are certain days that I hold very dear. Those days are not necessarily respected by the company. Being forced to work on those days doesn’t make you feel respected.   P 6:  I feel respected from my subordinates up, I don’t necessarily feel respected the other way. My opinions are dismissed without having been looked at properly so sometimes some of the things I say are not considered valid or I perceive they are not considered valid. That kinda makes me feel excluded.  P 6: It is a natural reaction that people respect your opinion they respect you. you feel part of a group. You feel included.   P 6: If you feel respected in a group you generally feel more included.   P 6: If your opinion is heard and respected, you feel included.  P 6: I think if you respect people’s views, or they think you respect their views, or you listen to their views then they feel more included and they give better. If my view is respected and even in a conflict situation my view is acknowledged then I feel included in that group.   P 7: Yes, definitely (I feel respected). Um, well, you know I never feel like people give me commands. They will always ask me how you feel about this or will you assist with this. I’ll never feel it is a definite command. In that way I feel people respect me and the person I am. And I feel that sometimes people say things to me which you know if you talk to someone in the right way you can get a lot out of that person. I find that people in the site treat me in the right way. Talk to me in the wrong way and I will avoid you and do what I can to avoid the task. But if someone comes to asks me to assist or anything in the correct way then I’ll put in my full effort 110%. That way I feel that they are respecting me and by respecting me like that I feel included.   P 8: Well if I didn’t feel respected I would definitely feel excluded. That is important to me in terms of inclusion.    P10: Definitely I would because then I would be afraid to voice my opinions. If they didn’t include or respect me they would just disregard it. Where as now I think they do take what I am saying and put it in the pot.  P11: Yes I do (think I'm more included because I'm respected). Now me for instance, I will get phonecalls from employees at night, 10 at night on weekends,  can you help me with this event. Not just basically giving them stock I need to go and learn and help  P12: Definitely, there’s are relationship (respect and inclusion). for myself yes. If I wasn’t resp cted then I wouldn’t be included as by so much people. I think People must have a certain respect. It depends where the respect comes from. Some comes from knowledge of a subject, some people respect you because of your high integrity and some people look up to that but I would think they are directly related.   P12: Yes definitely, Ag it makes me feel good. Definitely I feel included because of that. My answers will seam into each other. The respect is born from once again the knowledge I have acquired in the company. Regarding what I do and the way I tackle tasks. I’m an easy person to include because I get along with most people. I get along with people well regardless of cultural values.   P13: If I am given attention I have the feeling of inclusion. Not necessarily to be the centre of attention, but definitely to be noticed and recognised. Along with that recognition is respect, so if for example I am giving a training course and I get positive feedback that makes me feel more included.   P14: Yes very much so. I actually feel good about my inclusion, I have never had any run ins with any of my colleagues.   P18: If you respect one another the day goes by better. That is the main thing if you have respect for each other. It makes me feel more included.  P19: Because the people I work with understand you and respect you. Makes you feel great to come to work and see that people care for you. this makes me feel more included.  P20: Ja, within my team I feel included but not in the organisation.  P20: In my team I feel included but I don’t know when I will feel included with the bigger picture.   P22: I don’t know, sometimes people come to my office knowing they are going to be bullied but they still come so it is like a sanity check, go and get it and be prepared for what you here. I do feel included in most parts of the business.  P23: I feel respected for what I bring as a professional and I feel respected in terms of the contribution. I make at work so I have never had to demand respect or command respect or go and seek it out, it has come so from that point of view I have felt included.  P23: Ja probably (more included as a result of being respected). I think it would be much harder to not have the respect.   P24: No, that is exactly what it is, I need the inclusion for the participation of people to work with me and that is where I question myself. What am I doing wrong that I am not getting this participation. But I must also step back and say what is on their agenda and what is key to them that is making me feel excluded. Because I have to be included.  P24: My outputs are not respected - I don’t get their cooperation. From that section of the work, yes I feel excluded.  P25: People could easily look at me and say because I am from a different background, the old boys scout thing, and one could easily have a chip on your shoulder because you are not white, I am going to be blunt, and then a female at this company*, one could easily have a chip on one’s shoulder and say that because you are not white and because you are not male people won’t respect you or include you, but I don’t feel that way. I don’t ever feel that because I am not white or because I am not white I am not included.  P25: I don’t think it affects my feelings of inclusion I just think it is rude. I don’t think it is effective. I tend to loose all respect for them because for me it is not about where you are on the tree it is about who have your brought with you and who looks up to you for being in University of Cape TownAppendix D  279that position rather than I am the so and so and you will listen to me. I haven’t experienced personally people throwing their weight around. It hasn’t been an issue for me from an inclusion or exclusion perspective.  P26: It makes one feel excluded.  P27: If I don’t feel respected I don’t think I would be included at all. Because it plays a big part, everyone at this site has respect for each other otherwise it would be an uncomfortable environment to work in and respect plays a big part and I am happy I have got the respect from my peers and everybody here.  P27: Contributes greatly  because if they don’t respect you, you wont feel included at all.   P28: Definitely (it relates to my inclusion). If I wasn’t respected I wouldn’t be here  P29: I think when you do feel respected that you feel that you are part of a team and that basically that makes you feel included. If you are not respected you will think maybe they don’t want to relate to you or whatever, you are not worth it. So respect is a major issues for me for inclusion.  P30: Ya, being respected, how respect contributes relates to inclusion, if you don’t think you are adding any value to the company that is probably because someone you work with makes you feel that way. You don’t feel valued and you don’t feel included, you don’t feel as if you necessarily want to contribute, it is harder to contribute well if you don’t think your contribution is valued.  P32: I think there is a good relationship (with inclusion) when I feel respected. It is good.   P33: Ya. Definitely (respect makes me feel more included)  P34: Yes. (there is a relationship between respect and inclusion)  P35: I think respect needs to be given and it is earned. I don’t have a problem with my team or any of the other people I act with but then again it is personality. Some people might be more vocal and it depends on the way they come across. I don’t think it affects whether you are included or excluded.   P36: Very directly (relates to inclusion), on the positive side you are involved in discussions and adding value on the negative side you constantly to defend your position and very much feel like an outsider to have to try and justify what you are doing.  P37: It does lessen the feeling of inclusion, you don’t blame people for that, everyon  has got their lives. Things have changed drastically in terms of the way we used to be a few years ago where people had more time for things so the hustle and bustle and they don’t normally have time for relationships. That would impact on inclusion as well.  P40: Yes, it does now (relate positively to my inclusion). It used to be a negative feeling but very much a positive feeling now.  P41: Yes (respect makes me feel included) my manager*, he used to talk to us. When he request us to do something. He doesn’t have harsh words, he just says after you have finished this you must do that and then we used to have one on ones with our supervisor.  P42: It makes me feel good, respected, definitely, feel part of a team.  P42: It makes me feel more included.  P43: I think it (respect) counts a lot to my feeling of inclusion because if people don’t respect you they will isolate you.  Code: There is no relationship between respect and perception of inclusion  P21: No. It doesn't. (respect does not influence inclusion)  P39: Ya. There can’t be really (be a link between respect and inclusion) because we get excluded very quickly or shunned very quickly based on a decision we make so you have to explain it and get the guys behind to understand that they all understand the way you are thinking.  Code: There is a relationship between stereotypes and prejudice and perception of inclusion   P 3: Yes,  I do feel less included because of stereotypes. I haven’t heard it in my department, but if it was an everyday thing, I think to exclude, even though I myself have not been excluded but for anyone I am working with it will not create a harmonious environment.   P 6: Yes, (It does affect inclusion) why is it so hard for people to say I don’t like to be part of that group . it shouldn’t always be a racist thing or a gender thing. You should be able to say I don’t like that thing.   P 8: when stereotypes exist, people feel less included.  P16: Ya, they do feel excluded.  P26: Yes. (it makes me feel excluded)  P29: Very major. If you feel alone, I have talked about it, you don’t want to feel singled out. Not a good thing.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  280P33: Absolutely (sterotypes influence my inclusion). I am a person who is often stereotyped, totally. People often box me until they go oh, actually she is not. One they box you they either include you or exclude you, more often exclude you until they get their real view and go oh were wrong.  P34: Obviously I feel excluded because I wasn’t part of the decision.  P38: I don’t know whether the guys who work in one area* feel that they are being excluded from the other* or vice versa I don’t know. I have noticed that and I have noticed there is very little information sharing between the two. I don’t know whether they do feel there is exclusion as a result of that but I think that is one example that could definitely lead to exclusion  P39: Yes. (I think there is a relationship with inclusion)  P42: Ya, I think it will affect me (my inclusion). It would affect anyone, if there is a perceived idea about you, you feel you have to work harder and you always look and ask people and see people who are recognising your work. You will perform as you should be performing you don’t feel as though you are trying to prove something to anyone. I hope I am answering your question.  P43: Yes. (stereotypes influence inclusion negatively)  Code: there is no relationship between stereotypes and prejudice and perception of inclusion  P 5: No, not really (It doesn't affect my inclusion). I haven’t seen or experienced or heard of anything like that. (stereotypes and prejudice) P 9: Stereotyping is a big thing. I don’t know how it would affect inclusion but there is stereotyping out there. With meetings, a time is a time and everyone makes a joke about African time but it is true. If there is a set time then everyone must be there, there is no other time, you waste other people’s time. Stereotyping could be a small factor in inclusion because if you know someone is going to be late all the time you may not even ask them to be included in the task or anything.   P10: I haven’t had an experience of it. Everyone brings their own level of prejudice into everything. I think this company is quite good, we tend to see people as people, or we try. I think maybe if someone is prejudiced against they may not feel included but in that way it will affect included but I don’t feel it affects me.  P13: It didn’t affect my feeling of inclusion then but I can understand how for someone else it might. You have to be moulded in a certain way in order to move into that position. It is quite frustrating when the business decides before hand what the profile of that position must be.   P17: I think in all companies you have that, there whatever policies you have, policies is one thing and being on the floor and experiencing is a is different thing. It’s like filling in a form. When you fill in a form there is no prejudice or racism or anything, there’s no this, there’s no that… but on the floor it is different. But it doesn’t bother me. it doesn't affect my inclusion.  P19: No, his racism did not affect my inclusion.  P19: It doesn’t really affect me.  P20: No, it doesn’t affect my feeling of inclusion. I wouldn’t be where I am today if I listened to all those things.  P21: I don’t let it affect me at all because I know my worth and I am here to work and I will work.   P23: Yes so other people’s stereotypes haven’t affected me as an individual. I think it is probably different for other people.  P24: It doesn’t affect me (my inclusion).  P25: So it doesn’t really affect my inclusion but it could if I was of a state of mind where I wondered what he was thinking because then I would naturally say what I was thinking.   P32: Not strongly. (impact on inclusion)  P40: No, I haven’t been affected by it at all. I think it is still there under the duvet cover.  P40: It doesn’t impact on my inclusion at work at all.   Code: general comments around stereotypes   P 1: No matter what they guy does, he can out perform any white rep but they (the customer) wont give him that chance because he is black. Blatant racism.  P 6: Stereotypes is a silly thing in terms of the more included you are in a group, the less stereotypes you are thinking.   P 6: I think stereotypes are an excuse for how you treat people.  P 6: Yes, I exclude someone on what I want to, and I use a stereotype as an excuse  P 6: Don’t use stereotypes, he’s short or he’s black. Say I don’t like that person’s personality and I choose not be in a group with you. so he makes choices I don’t like. It is an issue between me and him.   P 7: a manager who was here sometimes called me a dumb blood. If I did something silly then he would say hey you dumb blond. I would always take it as a joke but sometimes it would actually make you do silly things even though your’re not or do silly things. Even through University of Cape TownAppendix D  281you know that you are not a dumb blond but because they say that it is like a stigma in the back of my brain. I always used to never go over my head by maybe small things like that, that could, that stereotype of being a dumb blond but I never took it too seriously. It was never a bit issue in my life, did not affect my role. It didn’t make me feel less included because I did not take it to heart.   P 8: I was thinking now what we spoke about the fit, just for example doing interviews and you have a specific type in mind that you are looking for. That is stereotyping already, it could even be a bit of prejudice as well. How it impacts on inclusion, obviously we are not appointing only a specific type but if the majority are a specific type and the others are not then the smaller group could feel less included if there is a focus on that specific type.  P11: No haven’t experienced it. (stereotypes and prejudice)  P12: people still get categorised into a box. People talk about 'them'. I found it hurtful but I have to tolerate it. we have come a long way in terms of diversity, If I look at it now and I look at it when we started, and the type of person we recruited used to be the same, but now we've got all colour in the sense there is more flavour.   P12: I still feel that people are put into boxes. everyone is but in boxes. it doesn't affect my inclusion negatively, but ya, because of my culture, cape coloured I am part of the majority as I live in the cape.   P13: A typical stereotype is that if you are creative, non analytical type you should go into sales and if you are analytical type you should go into ops.  P16: Yes. I am trying to think of a situation where but I don’t want to be judgemental on people, some people do things without realising this reflects how prejudiced are they to a certain race. Comes back to there has been situations where there are serious racial challenges between myself, my boss and Mark*. To an extent that you see in his interactions, for instance you tend to conclude that there is a belief that certain race is more inferior than a certain race.  P17: We all job a job to do. And my job is very important to me so do whatever you want to do, and I’ll be here. Racism and prejudiced and all the other nonsense that goes with that… doesn’t bother me  P17: If there was more colour in our environment, it would be a bit more interesting.  P18: I don’t know. Maybe there is but I don’t know. I don’t take notice of things like that.  P19: That is supposed to be something of the past. This specific guy he is going on and doing his own thing, he was the only guy. I don’t know if he had something against some people but I think he is more of a racist.   P20: You feel negative about them but at the end of the day you are here to do your job and not please anyone else by your boss or to do the right thing. So must just carry on with life and the job you are doing.   P21: I think that it depends on the individual how you choose to react and that is not to say people are racist. But I think you get this sort of unsaid vibe of black people are lazy. And they are somehow treated differently.   P23: Hugely. I think there are huge stereotypes and prejudices in my own life based on where I was raised and in many other people of all race groups and both genders. And I think we are all in this business good at working hard against those stereotypes but I think few of us recognise that the internal subconscious default position is still very strong stereotyped and biased. I think we like to think it is not there. So when we are in a group of all white people or all black people we can drop the mask and be rude about another group because that is what our default is. It is very strong, and we are not actively unpack it. It actually change someone’s subconscious make up it is huge work. I find myself still showing prejudice, I never talk about it or act on it but still in my mind. I can’t believe I am alone in that  P23: I don’t think we are able to be truly inclusive until we understand what we really think about somebody so as a white person, employing a potentially black administrator. My stereotype deep down in my psyche says black people are poor administrators and are disorganised and white are better educated and better organised. Typical white secretary stereotype, better. So I have to actively work against when I am looking at CVs and actively think that I need to break that down. Any manager employing people have that stereotype all the time which they have to challenge in various ways.   P23: I think when I think of myself as a female in this environment people don’t discriminate against me because I am female so they will never not invite me for a drink or not give me the promotion. So they will not take things away from me but at the same time they won’t give me more than the norm. So the norm is generally speaking white male culture, I am not excluded from that so those stereotypes haven’t impacted on me as a white female. But people haven’t moved closer to accommodate what I really need which is what I spoke about earlier.   P24: Ya, I felt it in the work environment (stereotypes and prejudice).  P24: I actually feel it but not in my environment. I felt it already.   P25: Stereotypes around age and being a female in the sense that when you are younger people think you know less and I think you are generally like on the same level they are. When you are female people also look at you and think you know less because you are a woman and you weren’t socialised the way I was socialised and therefore you are not street smart and you are not this or that so.  P25: I think like with this one manager he often says come on you woman, what is wrong with you woman and I often say to him it is not a woman thing, it is just a thing. Don’t put us in a box just because we are woman. And he always laughs but it does affect the way you think about the way they think. You become very mindful in interactions because you are wondering what they are thinking, oh she is a woman, do you know what I am saying. So it does filter an engagement.  P26: I think that it does affect it quite a lot. I do feel that because of certain race other people are more sort of taken seriously and gender, not just race, gender as well.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  282P30: I think this company* is very good at recognising diversity and making everyone feel as equal as each other as a general corporate culture. P34: I think it does exist. You can see it but it is also hidden away. It is not actually open up there but you can see something isn’t right.  P36: No, also I haven’t experienced any kind of stereotypes or prejudice around my work experience.  P37: It could affect to a large extent (stereotypes and prejudice affecting inclusion). But again I would address it I wouldn’t tolerate it.  P42: Stereotypes, people in general do have stereotypes. It is probably that we learn from our parents or people before it but it takes a special person to start looking beyond the stereotypes, but people have stereotypes in general that is my definite opinion. I am sure most people will agree with me. You may have the stereotype that black people are incompetent and you will find that a section of people within the black people so there is that perception that blacks need to work harder to prove themselves, that is the perception.   Code: systems and processes that drive diversity and inclusion   P 1: the social systems we have in place now, Team meeting outside of work where we are not allowed to talk about work once a week. That definitely works, makes you feel included.  P 1: We don’t want to come into the office on a Saturday,  P 2: I don’t think it is explicitly or overtly driven  P 2: Apart from the diversity and inclusion workshops and the Employment Equity Committee I haven’t noticed anything more done on an overt level, so people I don’t think are driven by it.   P 4: I think with the equipment processes, for example your equity targets, that is what is trying to balance number of people in terms of colour. That will affect diversity, cultures and whatever. In terms of inclusion I think we try very much in terms of social events, everyone gets invited. We leave it up to the person whether they want to go or not. Trying to include everyone.   P 4: We need to look at events that appeal to them. Like again, to me I want to encourage that, again doing this for a certain group, and then that for a certain group, dividing the people so I think we need to look at things that make them feel comfortable. Age is a factor in a different way.  P 5: For instances two weeks ago the HR manager came to us and spoke about the sexual harassment policy.   P 5: Nothing comes to my mind.  Look we had a family day for everyone to be there but which helps inclusion. But in terms of talking about it, maybe there are more ways than just talking about it. We are all so diverse. All in one room, having fun and everyone is there with their families and we try and understand where we come from. Talking about it on a regular basis, once a quarter, we are not doing enough about it.   P 6: We have very nice processes in terms of performance management. It is brilliant if It’s used right. If it is not used as a tool to smack people around and not choke the performance rating out of you that I want to give you then it is a nice talking forum where both the process driver and recipient where both people feel open and honest.  P 7: Well I’m sure we have a racial background of everyone. The company needs to be aligned with the employment equity act. I’m sure they have to supply reports to specified parties. So in that way they have to abide by it.   P 8: We go through the employee forum and then our senior manager's brief, all opportunities to communicate, not just the managers telling us what’s, it is a meeting place where people get together and the communication, that on its own can have a big impact on inclusion.   P 9: To drive, the only thing I am aware of is the recruitment employment that drives. I think HR are given targets, they are the only one that drives that.  P10: They have an employee forum. I have never been involved in it. I think we go a long way into taking people’s opinions into consideration. I think management here, they do walk around, they do chat to individuals.  P10: the senior manager is going through an awesome program at the moment which is quite an undertaking. I think he is going a long way to make people feel important, to make people feel that their opinions are heard. I think a lot of the time it is nice to have opinions and feelings but in an organisation you have to make the best financial sound decision. P11: I have no idea. A difficult question.   P12: we have induction when new employees come in. we have equity targets which we try to exceed and we look at it during our selection process. there is recognition that this type of person adds value in a specific team environment.  P13: I think performance management is the foundation which controls the manager employee relationship. The line manager plays an important relationship in the employees feeling of inclusion in your team. Also employment equity forums are another way. There is a history that these individuals are less included through, but I suppose other committees like this- in a decision making position would impact on inclusion.  P14: I am not sure as to what processes but I do know that the company is very set on the BBBEE profile whatever the case might be. To me it is a good thing.   P16: I cannot think of anything this company does.  P17: I’m sure there is a policy  P18: I mean the teams here do, maybe their teams they go out, have fun, bring the team together. Team building sessions.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  283It drives inclusion. P19: I really don’t know.  P21: Systems, I think even the recruitment drive, I think you give everyone a chance, when you are taking everyone in for interviews. The learnership program is also very good. It not only allows people from disadvantaged backgrounds to come in but you also give them tools, the course we give them, the maths, so that they can also develop themselves. You give them exposure to the trade, to the rest of the sales team. It is very good. Even things like the different functions we have here, where everyone comes together, lets go off and just be people.   P22: I think it is more often the things that are not consciously seen as driving diversity and equity that actually get the job done. I think the mistake we often make is that this is an equity program, which often suggests that what we are doing in that program is often different to what we do day to day. That is the mistake we make. If you make a conscious effort to treat people as people we would go a lot further. Don’t know what people hope to gain when they have cultural days and today is Indian culture and tomorrow is whatever. But I often think that just shows the difference where we need to find how we are similar not how we are different. We have a lot more similar things. Understand where we are different but focus on what we have in common.  P23: equity head count  P23: The Employment Equity Committee would be a process but they are supporting the targets, not more than that.   P23: There is zero space for disability at the moment, not because people are nasty or don’t want to facilitate bringing disabled people in but they are so pushed, no body is expecting them to prioritise so they don’t.  P24: Various things from a work point of view, Employment Equity Committee, not up to them it is up to me to drive it. If I am unhappy about something and if it is not talking to me, I must raise my concerns or what I am unhappy with.  P25: I mean with this whole social systems now I think that definitely potential could drive diversity and inclusion.  P25: I think other processes like performance reviews, goal setting exercises, all processes that drive inclusion and a sense of belonging, we don’t capitalise on those opportunities any longer. They are good systems but we don’t use them enough to highlight that we are different and yet we can get along and work together.   P26: Nothing.   P27: I actually don’t know of anything,  P28: I definitely think employment equity and as far as I know ee is the only system we follow.  P29: I don’t really know, ask HR.  P31: Haven’t a clue.   P33: What are we doing? I don’t know, not much  P34: I would say to respect one another and for the managers to come down to the floor.  P35: We are supposed to do that when we were supposed to talk about the different religious holidays and then we didn’t do it. I don’t believe there is any system or process. I think the culture is like that where people are caring and open and make you feel welcome. I can’t think of an actual system or process that is there.  Maybe it helps to go on induction and all of those kinds of things.   P36: I think that there are a number of surveys that happen around questions, perceptions of inclusion, is there inclusion, I think I filled one out not so long ago. I have been part of a forum where questions around inclusion have been raised. I think through the hiring process I know there is a very strong, obviously the BBB EE. I know there is a strong focus on that, that fact that certain positions are equity bonded obviously shows that there is a huge importance placed on ensuring diversity exists.   P37: There is not many right now unfortunately. It has faded over the past few years where you have had lots of interventions in terms of different types of meetings. You have had more get together, more opportunities to interact, more interaction from HR side in terms of crossing the bridge so to speak, in terms of interaction with different levels. We have geared away from that for some reason. Is has having a very negative impact in terms of myself and people that I know as well. That interaction isn’t there as it used to be. P38: a lot teams are developing social systems  P38: This Company* is quite serious about employment equity I am not sure how the figures are looking from that regard  P39: I am planning one for Sunday to have a chat and have some drinks and socialise. We miss them. You see the guys to say hello but never get to chat so I think it is important to have a break away.  P39: I know the employee forum has started now so that is there.  P39: the manager’s briefs, everyone is invited, they want everyone to attend.   P42: I think our employment requirements also, when we advertise positions and clearly state we need a specific candidate for it.  Code: Things that drive exclusion   P 1: We don’t have any team meetings with two teams, we don’t do anything social with the other sales teams.   P 1: Bit of loneliness. University of Cape TownAppendix D  284P 2: I think tenure due to various things that have possibly happened before the time that I got here that I wouldn’t be able to make reference to P 2: My approach is either you need to fit in or if it doesn’t work for you you need to deal with it.  P 2: As opposed to feeling like the company needs to make me feel included.  P 4: decision making is not inclusive  P 6: Religiously I feel excluded. I have very strong views about some things. There are certain days that I hold very dear. Those days are not necessarily respected by the company. Being forced to work on those days doesn’t make you feel respected.   P 6: I feel for the Muslims that are in our group.  P 6: their religious days are not considered so I feel excluded on their behalf man. They have to put in a day’s leave (Muslims on their religious occasions).   P 6: They have to put in a day’s leave (Muslims on their religious occasions). They have to do extra to be in the company. And that kind of makes me feel excluded on their behalf in terms of an absolutely non racial thing, people in admin, they may say it is a perception, but I think they have a higher perception of themselves. Because it is white collar work they kind of make you feel not welcome in their space. That’s what makes me feel excluded.   P 8: I would feel excluded if I don’t have structured goals or if I am uncertain about my role.   P 8:  I would feel excluded if I had to be independent, on my own all the time. Like for example our team meetings, where you get together and everyone’s input and views or maybe what I am doing in my area, where all of that is put together. It kind of creates that sense of bringing your part, or contribution to the team. I don’t like to work independently. Important to me to have that ongoing contact and engagement with people, different forums, team meetings  P 9: I was doing work but never invited to anything. It was like do all the schlep work at the office but after 4 no one knows you exist,   P10: From a time aspect when they have a lot of after hours functions and they expect you to attend. If you don’t attend you are frowned upon but is not always easy to attend.   P10: Speaking from a personal aspect to me it is a male dominated environment and a lot of the guys have wives who don’t work or who are still at home with their kids and they don’t understand that if you are having a meeting and it goes on until six and you need to leave at 4 to go and do something and for them what is the problem, they don’t have those pressures on them. That is the only thing really, the functions you are expected to attend.  P10: No, I don’t think it does. Important events I will attend, when I do go I do feel included and I do feel part of the team. They don’t make me feel less part of the team because I don’t go to all the functions.   P11: I don’t feel excluded because on a day to day basis I am involved with all the sales teams, the sales managers, every time I need to know something they are always available for me, so I wouldn’t say there is something I feel excluded in.  P12: Top thing would be lack of self confidence sometimes. Pre build perception, which would be not thinking that I should be interacting people at a certain grade, but this is a people perception from my side. There are definite structures of hierarchy, and you cannot go and tap the MD on his shoulder. This comes with experience and with years being at the company. For myself it is easier because I have been here for 5 years, but take someone that has just joined the company for example, he might take a bit longer because he doesn’t know people and positions for example. The think that most of the stuff that excludes you the most is one’s own view and opinion and your ability to overcome that.  P13: when for example someone in the team will send an sms to 3 people in the team but I am not one of them then I feel excluded or when I am overlooked for something I have done I feel excluded and probably like the general feel of something being organised and I am not the central part of that of something happening. Not invited for whatever reason.  P14: I would say that functions and stuff like that although we are always invited, I choose not to attend for some reason or other. For me it is more the younger crowd. But I suppose if I want to go I can go because I am always invited to promotions.  P16: So not being recognised,  P16: not having decision making  P16: I think more of where do I fit in going forward in terms of my career ambitions and what plans does the business have for me in, for me to realise growth in my chosen career.   P19: I think if I say excluded most probably myself, not fitting in.   P19: what makes me not fit in is having different opinions that you want to say that people don’t understand that makes you angry.  P20: I have won two awards since I have been here in 2006 and 2007, but that doesn’t mean, that is my team voting for me. I don’t know who votes for me and what the criteria are but I just see the awards and I really appreciate that but I don’t know whether it is the supervisor or who but they have no way of talking to us, they treat us like kids.  P20: The way they talk to us is no respect. Everyone is feeling it.   P20: we don’t know what is going on in the company like launches  P20: Most of the time we don’t feel included at all. I don’t at this point in time.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  285P20: Sometimes I feel recognised but there are those negative things that put you off. You know about what they say if all the good things get lost if there is only one thing that is done incorrectly and then you forget. If someone does something wrong, you forget all the good things that have been done before. Something like that. I haven’t done anything wrong, but when you feel negative you feel these people don’t appreciate what I have done.   P21: Afrikaans. I don’t speak it but you find people tend to drift into Afrikaans in meetings and you occasionally have to remind them and for me a lot of things go over your head especially when we are talking shop.   P21: Also been an outsider, having come into the organisation, a lot of people in the depot have either moved up or shifted, they know what is going on. Some people tend to forget to keep me in the loop of what the history was. You continuously have to ask what was the history to that.   P22: Sometimes you have to be pragmatic and do things for your own self preservation. But I have never felt excluded from decisions or activities where I should have been included.   P23: People making decisions in the pub. I like to go to the pub but can’t always because I have family commitments so people who choose not to have commitments after work who can discuss things in the pub. I think it is similar to discussing things on the golf course. That in a covert way makes me feel excluded.   P23: Having children makes me feel excluded because in this environment I don’t think it is cool to have children and want to spend time with them.   P23: And probably being outspoken, being a controversial person makes me feel excluded. People have referred to me as the shop steward because I challenge things, so that makes me feel excluded where my different view are not popular.   P24: Nothing. Just the changes that were happing around the site we were scattered all around the place so you know that wasn’t very conducive but now we are in a central point again.  P25: I don’t know that I felt excluded actually.  P26: It’s not really that you can pin point but there are certain levels of hierarchy at the site with some line managers or certain levels of jobs around here you would found certain people around here know things that you don’t know which you are expected to know.  P26: In terms of race, most of our sales guys, majority of the white people there  P27: I think maybe here at this site a bit excluded because I am a lower grade than a lot of people here.  P29: Basically if you are getting the same type of thing all the time and you don’t get developed, some people always get chances in life and the work place, they will go on courses, opportunities and maybe one person won’t get the same chances. That makes you feel excluded from the rest.  P29: Maybe if you work in a place where only men or woman or only white or coloured, that I think, if the other people don’t make you feel at home you will feel you are the only one with all the rest, that would make you feel excluded.  P31: because he never shared, nothing ever came my way  P31: You never knew where you stood with him if it was good or bad  P33: The first thing that makes me feel excluded in this particular depot is the language. A lot of people speak Afrikaans, I have addressed it before when we are sitting in meetings, it doesn’t surprise me when some switches to Afrikaans and I loose track. I don’t know if there is anything else that makes me feel excluded other than that.   P33: What was interesting at conference was that they were watching the little boys that they recruit, like this little youngster coming into the company that they are taking under their wings and this is how you feed into, I have never been bothered by it but because I was interviewing someone I was thinking about it. I saw little boys being recruited to become the future old boys.    P33: What do I have to add, um, my one concern and maybe I am just looking at diversity from one aspect and that is looking from an employment equity point of view is just thatwe have had so many white appointments, I am looking at diversity just from a race point of view. And for a company where we are trying to drive, and I understand the market, I think we are totally just like doing the opposite or what we are trying to do  P34: We the people work on the floor we don’t get recognised by the company, it is only the managers recognised.  P34: I would say I don’t feel much included.  P34: Ya, very much excluded. I am here 7 days a week so my personal life is here, more here than at home. If something is wrong at home and I speak to him about it, it should be closed, he shouldn’t then go and run to someone else to go and ask.   P34: Very much excluded.   P35: I had to tell my boss, please can I have some time off it was a Religious holiday  P35: Something like that where it was, for example the other day was Jewish New Year, we all read about it, I sms my friends with a proper greeting who are Jewish so you have to be aware of things and for me that nobody was aware, not that I took it personally but it is just because I, and I know it is wrong that because I do something expect other people to do it, but I would take the time to remember when it was your special day.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  286P35: It also depends on your personality type so because I look at my staff and there are a lot of things that would make them feel excluded but then it does depend on their personality, then the other oakes some of them are more extravert, they go out and don’t care if someone didn’t talk to them whereas other people would stand in the corner.  P37: Grade level which only allows intervention at certain levels and then you are privy to certain information even though sometimes it does affect you.   P37: Obscure transparency makes you feel excluded.  P38: information is only available to a certain number of people.   P39: The constant thing here* is that the guys say they never feel included but when they are invited they never go so you can’t say I am excluded because I don’t want to go, take a part of that on yourself.  P40: Decisions made at senior level that impact on me but there is no consultation.  P41: The decisions that sometimes are taken, we are not included, mainly the guys in a lower guys.   P41: you are not acknowledged.   P41: We don’t need any promotion because we know we won’t get promoted.    Code: Things that drive inclusion   P 1: when we have promotions in the reps, we always get invited, that makes me feel included  P 1: we get invited to all the things that happen in the District, people in ops who have farewells  P 2: I definitely think it comes from the team and like the team leader, the line manager  P 2: I think just the nature of the individual in the team  P 2: The little things like having lunch together, asking if you want to go out together for lunch, those kind of things  P 2: don’t think it is anything particular that they do, it is more about me making sure that I am in touch with them and their needs to make sure I know when I needed for their needs.  P 2: Then can I be a part of it, how can I be involved, and then by the fact it will be this date, that date I can join, that’s, ya but it’s a different level of inclusion because it is more for business need not for personal need.  P 2: Where as for the team it is more a personal level of feeling included.   P 2: I feel a lot has to do with fairness,  P 2: A lot of the situations I have seen has been due to fairness and perception of fairness.   P 3: normally we would have more frequent meetings and decision making affecting our level of the department.  P 3: Certainly the GM’s update when they happened.   P 3: That makes you feel included in being aware in what’s planned. So the information and communication.  P 3: I think it just in a meeting, you feel that you are being heard  P 4: sense of belonging and respect in the work place generally from either top management to those who report to you  P 4: to be happy in work environment.  P 4: Flexi in terms of asking to come late, or leave early, flexi hours very much comfortable.   P 5: First thing the environment of people care for you, not just here to do a job. That is the primary thing, that is the reason we are here to earn a living and do a job but the feeling of people care for me, not just about me being here 8 hrs a day.  P 5: One thing I look for, I want to be part of the family. Caring is very important because I spend a lot of my time at work. I am their colleague but there is some sort of care going on here.  P 5: When I am at work I love my job, love my colleagues. I am always there. Sometimes a personality thing, not one to sit in corner and not get recognised. When I am in a room I want people to know I am there.  P 6: I feel included in terms of the fact that we all speak together, all speak to each other.   P 6: It is very seldom that you find a group standing speaking and when you come into the group they continue speaking the language or dialect of their choice. They don’t change the language to fit the group as a whole. That makes me feel included. The fact that the group is as close as it is. We share food, stories of our lives, that makes me feel very included.   P 7: I would say the social gathering of employees like braais or we’ll go out for a few drinks  University of Cape TownAppendix D  287P 7: Also being included on e-mails  P 8: OK if I say engagement in general with employees, colleagues, where there is that whether there is a meeting, talking, engaging, that makes me feel included.   P 8: feeling part of a team, sharing with another person from my company  P 8: I think being, most importantly that I am adding value. That is probably the most important thing for me. What we spoke about, doing something important, impacting positively on my team. Knowing that you are always contributing positively. I think just feeling valued. Feeling important. Adding that value, when you do that, when someone praises or gives recognition, that feeling of being valued, that you are whatever the contribution is valued by the business.  P 9: being a team basically I feel included there, when it comes to meetings, social events, even team based and even the other day I felt included when the sales teams invited me to one of their promotions.  P10: I think the program they have put in place with the work hours, the flexi time, a very nice idea. I do make use of the flexi time to an extent, that does help me although it is not always easy in line with  business  P10: Don’t know if it counts but having a line manager who understand that having a child makes things a bit more awkward and need a bit more lea way. That helps me to be included.  P11: Firstly I would say just basically the people here, they make you feel welcome, like one big family. Everyone knows what they need to do and the environment is so well set up and you know what to do, you are part of a team.  P12: Involvement from my peers on those grade, when I started being this new grade, it was a little akward specially at management level coming from where I was.  P12: I got a lot of encouragement from the guys especially one particular senior manager.  P12: I have had opportunities to interact with people from other Districts that are in a similar position. So there was definitely inclusion there.   P13: attention from my boss and attention from my team actually  P13: praise for good work done  P13: I think general requests from you know example if someone from another team makes coffee and offer to make me coffee.  P14: the environment here, we are like one big family here.   P14: The managers are always there for you, open door policy with you and I have been here for 8 years with the company and but I have never felt that this is not the place for me. I feel quite comfortable here.  P16: recognition, being recognised for what I am capable of doing  P16: Being in a position that allows me to make decisions that influence change in the environment.  P16: The third is more feedback on what the direction the business is taking and more around the transparency around feedback in what the business is going for, its objectives, what is my role within the business, going forward.  P16: I think more of where do I fit in going forward in terms of my career ambitions and what plans does the business have for me in, for me to realise growth in my chosen career.   P17: about colour or gender, we get included  P17: secondly I’ve been here a long time so I get included in just about everything    P18: if you are approachable you can be included.  P18: attitude and your personality  P19: First of all I would say team work. Everybody comes from different background. Come to work, go, see different things, understand different people.   P21: I think having my opinion taken seriously, being given the opportunity to voice my opinion is very important  P21: even if there are conflicting ideas or believes one’s opinion is respected.  P22: I suppose my personality has never allowed, has been such that I make people include me because I always believe what you allow you teach so I don’t allow people not to include me so I think I always feel included and if I didn’t I would go out of my way to make sure I was because I have that sort of personality.  P23: I think they would be having people take an interest in me as a complete person and not just an employee. People acknowledging that I come to work as a woman and not as a person who fits into a man’s world or a woman trying to fit into a man’s world and related to that is time, that people spend the time to ask about me, the person as opposed to just the worker in me.   P23: I was watching a man and his friend taking pictures of each other, they were two black men and it reminded me of a number of other incidents recently, they were foreign and I didn’t know they were foreign because they were speaking any language, they didn’t look foreign but the acted foreign and what was so clear is as a black man in this country for foreign, they have a different level of confidence University of Cape TownAppendix D  288than the black men or women than natural South Africans and a more superior level of confidence and it made me think to what extent black people in this country have not been able to stand up with confidence for 100 different reasons but it was so obvious and so evidence and so sad. Whether a Kenyan, Malawian or Egyptian, it is so clear to me that they come with a respect for the whole person as an individual, as a man and able to express that without talking but just in their being. A South African black person can’t come anywhere near to that because of whatever, oppression or the education or the sense of self or confidence and that spoke to me about inclusion. Those individuals who are not able to express that confidence don’t yet feel included, or respected or able to stand up on their own. It as very sad, but it struck me a lot recently. You must look out for it, I don’t know if it just through my eyes as a white person.  P24: support from the emotional side being included  P24: inclusion in meetings my work contribution  P24: my physical outputs in meetings makes me feel included and making me see part of the bigger picture.   P24: I am included in that meeting, I have a slot and I must present and if I present nonsense I will get whipped. So that is inclusion.  P24: Diversity and inclusion is a state of mind. If you have insecurity you will feel a certain way, if you are not empowered you will feel a certain way. Sometimes it is a lack of empowerment that people feel excluded or not part of the bigger picture and that is where - start looking at yourself first.   P25: Communication  P25: lack of comparison between different people  P25: indoor policy  P26: we have certain meetings that I partake in which makes me feel included  P26: certain social events at the site as well that makes me feel included.  P27: I am permanent now so I do feel included because when you a temp you don’t get what the permanent staff do. So I feel included now that I am permanent, that is a big point.   P27: in meetings I am included in meetings, people ask me for feedback which makes me feel included. Makes me feel my opinion counts.   P27: Something like a swipe card makes you feel included and I have a swipe card. I can’t think of anything else.  P28: included in whatever is happening, meetings, social events  P28: everybody has got your back, and that really hits me. I was struggling with my licence and Mark* he helped me  P28: My  manager also, it makes me part of  a team, also feel included.  P29: Yes, fairness. Otherwise you will feel like what is going on this guy is pushing me into a corner because I am a different race.   P30: if there is a function everyone is invited. From a social interaction side there is big interaction. I have never been slighted because I am a female there is complete inclusion around whether you are male or female and I feel very included.  P31: I was included in that which is nice for a change, makes me feel I am part of the team previously I was an appendage when needed it was there  P31: he is much more vocal, happy to throw his toys, very happy to throw his toys but you know where you stand with him, He will come and say this is what I want done let’s do it, let’s talk about it.   P32: I would say the development, I feel included in the development, the fact that I also push myself to be developed.  P32: When I do that I get feedback from my superiors P32: To the views which I bring sometimes I also feel included in that, they listen to my views.   P33: I think a sense of camaraderie with the people I work with  P34: The guys I work with, they are the only guys that recognise me as being part of the team. But upwards, I don’t really count. I am just here to do a job.  P35: the environment that people are caring and they do stop and chat and yes I do know that whilst no one is going to do your work for you sometimes when you chat to someone else they can offer you a solution.  P36: types of engagement I have with the other people in the department so people taking the time to take a few minutes, have a cup of coffee, have lunch, so people make a lot of effort in the department to spend time and be together.  P36: I think increasingly being consulted on a lot of the stuff I am doing, being asked for my opinion as supposed to just producing the report, but being asked what it all means.  P37: Systems that are common, then the interventions in terms of training that makes me included to a certain extent.   P37: Certain meetings which requires my levels of intervention, that is inclusive.  P37: The relationships with the people that are here makes me feel included in terms of the atmosphere that is here. University of Cape TownAppendix D  289P38: I think the amount of integration that has been forced on us in the last year, a very good thing.  P38: When the business does take effort to get opinions out of us on certain matters when they do ask us to conduct certain surveys that we do, that makes me feel included because that is me objectively and honestly providing feedback to the business on some of the things they may have implemented. Makes me feel I don’t just work for the company but I contribute to the company and they take my opinion seriously.  P38: I think just having your managers and your colleagues and the general staff taking a personal interest in you. I have noticed at this site* that does happen a lot, every morning they ask how you are, what is going on in your life. That makes me feel included because we are all individual, all human beings as well and we need to connect.   P39: I would say firstly the guys open up to you, generally having chats , you can pick up if the guys trust you by what they are saying to you.  P39: Probable various from person to person because for me I prefer to be on my own but again if you go into the manager brief when other departments are there, it is how you include yourself. Because if you sit around one side and say no one is going to talk to me then no one will talk to you. So you need to contribute as well, that plays a big role.  P40: Involvement, ask my opinion by my manager  P40: to be included in meetings that are not necessarily orientated in my area of work*  P40: I think it is nice the staff ask you your opinion on things, not necessarily work related but also personally related.  P41: we talk and share our views and sometimes   P42: think decision making and my values, my input is valued  P42: given some carte blanch in the areas I am good at.  P43: I feel everyone is being treated fairly  P43: or personally I feel as I am treated equally  P43: don’t feel I am being undermined because of race or gender.  P43: I am not sure if it is because I am management level, everyone seems to be supportive and understanding towards one another.  P43: That support that you get from your peers.  P43: That respect and open communication and people are very straight forward.  Code: Relationship between trust and perception of inclusion  P 1: I don’t exclude her from anything even though I don’t trust her.  P 3: Yes, my levels of trust reflects positively on my inclusion.  P 4: Yes there is a strong relationship between trust and inclusion, if you don’t trust me you are not going to include me.  P 4: If you trust me to a certain extent you will include me to a certain extent. If you fully trust me you will fully include me in whatever is happening.  P 5: The fact that I am trusted in my work environment does make me feel included because I don’t feel I am second guessed all the time. P 5: there is a gap especially between management and some of our people who work here where the employees don’t trust what is being said. There is a feeling of I am going to be nailed for things and it actually leads to people feeling not included.  P 5: There is no trust. If I say to you this and this happens and it doesn’t matter how much I can convince you but if you don’t trust me it won’t work. And I have seen that and the guys feel excluded.   P 6: In terms of inclusion, if you feel trusted you feel included. If you feel I like this oak, if he feels you feel you trust him, then he’ll feel more included.  P 7: Um, well some of the things I deal with is very confidential between the HR manager and myself. She knows that she can trust me 100% with that information. I’ll never go disclosing that to anyone. When I go chat to her it is confidential as well. Between me and my boss as well. Some of the things are confidential and I keep it confidential. Because they trust me with this information it makes me feel included.   P 9: I think it plays an important role, definitely, if someone can’t trust me they wont include me in whether it is personal or work, if they can’t trust you to meet deadline it will make a huge difference with inclusion.  P10: I think it is very important. Trust is earned. A lot of people just expect you to trust them. I think if you trust the people and you know the people trust you, you will feel a lot more included and part of that team. That relationship will be much better. Trust is important.   P11: Highly because for me because when a manager phones me and asks me how is something working, can you give me feedback on it or so forth, I explain to guys on a higher level than myself makes you feel good.   University of Cape TownAppendix D  290P12: Definitely (the level of trust impacts on your level of inclusion). And it is not purely work related. People open up to you, speak more frankly to you, honestly, they give you more transparent or genuine feedback other than the diplomatic answer.   P13: We are all very honest with each other and because I am sharing that level with a whole bunch of other people the relationship to inclusion is very high.  P14: Yes I feel more included because of the trust relationship.  P16: If a person trusts you will be able to deliver, it builds your confidence. Also the issue of confidence building takes a lot to affect inclusion. There is a relationship.  P16: when a person trusts you, you tend to feel more included.  P18: Yes, I do. (there is a relationship between trust and inclusion)  P19: Yes, it does, makes me feel more included.   P20: It makes me feel included because I know my team is there for me even if I am not there.  P21: Generally in terms of trust in the office, I think people are pretty open, not on a personal level but generally things to do with work, if they feel things should be done another way people are always willing to share and people are always willing to help. If you look at inclusion in that respect, yes.  P21: If we trust each other, we are sharing information and guiding each other as we go along, very important.  P22: There are some managers that will put you through the training and give you the skills but do not give you the space in which to exercise them. The ones with good leadership skills allow you to do that. They give you the skills, they tell you what they expect, the trust you will deliver the output. How you get there is up to you. Those are attributes of good leaders. When you have, trust is pretty much part of being included. What I described to you as my experience has always been underpinned by trust because how else does it make it work. If you feel trusted you feel included, that has been my experience   P22: Trust plays a large role in making you feel included.  P22: Because I knew that he trusted me I would go out of my way not to loose it. I think that was quite clever. Lots of freedom but underpinned by trust. I would have been very upset with myself if I ever lost his trust and I don’t think I did, certainly not in the time he was here.  P22: Hugely (it affects my inclusion). If I was never called in for advice I think I would have felt excluded but then I wouldn’t have been here as long as I have.  P23: I get a sense in the last 6 months there has been a high level of trust and it has contributed to making me feel included so there has been a very strong relationship there.   P24: When it comes to my team, not my team, us, because I can’t work without them, it was totally open, everyone was included, everyone had a clear sense of what they were contribution.   P24: No, you just feel valued less if the trust level is lower.  P24: Yes. (higher the trust the higher the level of inclusion)  P26: No, it does.(impact on my feeling of inclusion)  P27: I would say if you don’t trust your peers you can’t feel included because if you don’t trust someone there is something scratching in the background, something not right there. You can’t trust if things are being help back and if things are being held back you wont trust so you have to definitely trust to feel included.  P29: Trust is a major part of being in a work team. Without trust there can’t be a relationship. That is definitely part of it (inclusion). P30: Very much so, if there is any disharmony people feel isolated and we all like a sense of unity there is not that.  P32: I definitely think so, if we involved ourselves more in the matter of trust we would feel more included.  P36: I suppose it makes me also be able to trust the group so if there is no reason for me to question people’s motives then I have to trust in their decisions and the things they do and then there is a mutual respect that builds, I feel included as part of whatever group or process is there.   P36: Ya, as mentioned before there is definitely a strong relationship between the two. If you can’t trust the people you are working with you don’t feel a team so there is no inclusion.  P37: that is quite an issue with many staff members right now, where trust is concerned, again it affects you negatively if trust is lacking. You could perceive it to be that ways that you are excluded from certain things you would normally be privy to.    P38I think if ever there was a time when individuals were not trusting of each other I think they would be less likely to source information form them so whoever is not being trusted and have an opportunity to input would definitely feel excluded because you are not getting an opportunity to feed in as much information as you would like to. I definitely would feel excluded if I was in that situation, fortunately I am not in that position though.  P39: I would say it does impact (inclusion), obviously if you do trust you would be more forthcoming with certain things and if you don’t  it would have an impact.   P40: It has made me feel very included (having a sound trust relationship) University of Cape TownAppendix D  291P42: if there is high levels of trust you would feel more included and if there is low level of trust you feel less included.  P43: there is strong trust between myself and my team and myself and the line managers in the region. That impacts very positively on inclusion.  Code: Unique difference driving inclusion   P 2: I think there is a lot of acknowledgement in the team particularly what you bring to the team  P 2: in terms of feeling valued, being given a fair chance to voice my opinion, voice my suggestions.   P 3: I’m probably quieter than most, but just being given the opportunity to express myself.   P 4: My personality  P 4: the decision I make, he is supportive  P 5: Look as I said I am not very quiet. I speak my mind and people respect me for that.  P 5: I think about what I am going to say, I say what I want to say and I substantiate what I say. People respect me for that.  P 6: I must say that the feedback we get in the performance management feedback I get a lot of very positive things.  P 7: some people might look as a bit of an agony aunt and they moan and groan but I will always be a listening ear for them. People really appreciate that.  P 7: um, it definitely makes me feel more included (when my unique difference is valued). They see me as one of the company, they acknowledge me, don’t just see me as a employee, they acknowledge me as part of the company and that I play an important role.  P 8: Well, that feeling that you can add value to someone specific or team, it makes me feel like I am contributing, people will come to me for specific issues, where they need support.  P 9: If it wasn’t for me they wouldn’t have a clue where they are. Being included in meetings, I partake in that. I also have a role to play as well as them.  P 9: So I feel more included now that there is role clarity.  P10: Our team knows each other well and we all understand that we have our priorities and we are very within the team, the diversity with the backgrounds, it is big, so we all have our different needs. The team is fine, we don’t have issues within the team. We accept if you need to do something go and do it. If we clash, it is discussed and we all bring our own points of view which can only add to it. But it doesn’t cause friction within the team.  P11: proactive, use my initiative to do things better.  P12: I think my opinions are respected partly to due with what you no said my unique difference but more to do with my experience. That experience, where I have worked, my culture, background, where I am from, that I was able to work in certain markets, so I think my opinion get opinions because I have done a good job there and could relate honest feedback relating those markets, so a senior manager would respect my opinion because I have proven that I know what I am talking about.   P12: What I think is my unique difference is that I can relate to guy on the corner that is standing there with his pants hanging down that is one of our customers, and relate it back to our business in a proper way.   P13: My contribution is recognised a lot through my line manager if I am recognised for something over and above what I am doing or if any achievements are recognised by people other than my line manager like my team. P14: They value my straight forwardness, I am to the point. They know exactly how I feel about things.   P16: I think that is kind of I wouldn’t say difficult question to answer but the fact that I have mentioned that not being recognised makes me feel excluded it means that I haven’t got to a point whereby I have actually felt the business really recognises me for what I do.   P19: Because I am productive.  P19: More included. Like I said like you said excluded, then it is totally up to me.   P21: I have listened to a lot of concerns my team has. I may not have all the answers but I think people just want to vent out their frustrations. I have given them an opportunity and being an outsider I was able to share my point of view so that they could see things in a different light. I always try to motivate people to look at it from another perspective.   P21: Because there is always that sense of us and them. I think it is all us, we work for the same company, have the same goal. Trying to what word can I use, just to make my team understand we are routing for the same team, it is not a war, not an us and them, not an internal war.  P21: Within my team? Yes. (It has made me feel more included)  P22: you have to own your space, if you don’t own your space other people will determine what it will be so you have to go out and owned your space and I think I have owned my space to a certain degree and it comes about as a result of a couple of things.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  292P22: I have made a deliberate effort to understand the business, and the external environment and that is a unique space and I have gone out of my way to own that.   P22: The second thing is it is my personality to be forthright, in my personality to speak what I want to say with out fear of retribution, you have got to say what you need to say without fear or favour, that is the term so I think it is in the nature of my personality.   P22: As I go back to what I am saying, a lot is a result of the leadership style we have enjoyed because you can have a leader who is, not easy to be the conscience or minority voice and so if one is that, if that is your personality or role, if the leadership doesn’t make a conscious effort or it is not part of the way things are in the organisation it can and then if you add to that my race and my gender you could have felt excluded. So I would say it is pretty much a mixture of own personality and leadership style, it could have been different.  P23: The woman in my team recognise it because I fit in. In my other team , I think it is recognised but I don’t think it is valued. It is recognised because I bring my differences to work, being who I am, a woman with a family. I don’t think it is valued as me because people don’t talk about it, not a point of discussion.  P23: I have to work hard to fit in. I have to work against what is natural to me and it is fine.   P23: I manage it fine although it doesn’t allow me to be who I am as a woman, it limits that, it restricts the whole person. That is from a gender point of view.  P23: From a face point of view the dominant culture is a white culture so I fit into that though I am very aware of where people don’t fit in and I am sensitive to that. I am almost paranoid when I see a new black person coming into the team and people stereotypes are naturally imposed on that person and I worry, I try and counter act that but I am very aware of it. I probably over whatever, over compensate for that.  P23: I enjoy the fact that I am dealing with professional people of all race groups  P23: I enjoy the fact that I am dealing with professional people of all race groups. I grew up in a very white dominated culture where everyone I interacted with in another race group was subordinate to me whether it was the gardener, char, postman, that was my experience of people who were not white So I actually value enormously working with professional who are not white because it helps to change my mindset which is very racist. My default position is racist because all my formative years had a racist tone. So that impacts on my view of inclusion, another huge value for me that we have a mixture and I am just one of the differences. I feel included because I am different and everyone else is different.  P24: What is so nice about this, how I know I am included in everything because there were clear lines drawn at the beginning of the year, this is what I will be doing, direction was given, specific targets everything we always thought of. We had our goals and if you follow that you know that the information that you are gathering and analysing is being disseminated. That is why you are included in everything.  P25: People realise that I don’t eat, sleep this company, I actually go home and have a life. People respect that and that is who I get recognised.   P25: In some ways I feel excluded because I am like that. Because some people here eat, live, breathe, sleep this company where there are quite a few that don’t but not everyone else is brave enough to say that this isn’t the bee all and end all of my existence so I think because I am respected for that I also feel excluded for that.  P25: How does it relate to my inclusion, it is difficult to say that besides that people respect that person that I am I do feel kind of excluded because I don’t go to social gatherings, I never went to 'the boss's farewell and I got looked at funny so I felt excluded.  P26: It does make me feel more included because some people don’t really know how to approach other people. I break that for myself and the odd hello, how are you, works for me.  P29: Because I am different to them they kind of respect me and we get along really well. I don’t know exactly why but I did a kind of different perspective out of the guys. I don’t know if it is because I am white but I have never got I don’t want to work with you because you are different.   P29: Ya, definitely ya.   P31: Well it didn’t, it really made me feel like an outsider P31: Yes I suppose it did to a degree because no matter how much you give if you don’t get anything back why must you carry on giving. It is a waste of effort eventually so you just shrug it off.  P33: I am trying to think. I think probably similar to what I said, people have come to know me for the individual that I am and they respect that. Be whatever aspect of my life I bring to work, I have presented the whole Me* to the work place and the people I would like to have accept that have accepted it, it makes it easier to work with.  P36: I operate with a high level of integrity  P36: People appreciate my honesty and the way I engage with them.  P36: Well I suppose if people feel they can relate and trust you then they would be more inclined to include you in whatever be it work or social engagements. So that contributes to it. (inclusion)  P37: I know the systems well and I have been specialising in my field which has helped me to assist others.   P37: Yes, definitely it makes a difference. (I am more included)  P38: I have operated in a couple of departments in my time here and I think I have been here so long that they do value that input that I bring.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  293P38: Well when someone comes to you and asks you for advice and they are actively pulling you in wanting to get you involved, it automatically makes you feel included, you feel a part of what is going on so I think that for me is a major plus.  P40: I have been here for 300 years so I know the systems, the business, the process.  P40: Also my personality, fairly outgoing. I know a lot of the processes so people tend to ask me my opinion.  P42: Yes, definitely. (feeling valued definitely affects my feeling of inclusion)  P43: I think to encourage people to be themselves it brings the best from the people. If you have to pretend to be something else then you even fake everything even being included because you want to make people happy about this or that. So I think just being yourself.  Code: Relationship between victimisation and perception of inclusion   P 2: Um, I haven’t experienced victimisation in my team or in the company personally. I’ve seen it sort of ya, I also think that in the instances where I have seen it, because victimisation is quite strong. Is a strong action. Is there is different question for bullying. Where I have seen it and it hasn’t happened to me personally, I can understand why someone would feel less included but I haven’t experienced it personally.   P 4: I think there is a correlation between the two (victimisation and inclusion) in the sense that if you are a victim of victimisation you will end up not feeling part of the team. Sadly this morning we had a one on one with he is contemplating resigning because he feels he is not being included in the team. So he is being victimised. So they talk to each other. If you are being victimised you are not part of the team, people don’t want you.  P 5: I think there is a few people who feel they are being victimised around our site*. The crazy thing I don’t understand is that the same rules that apply to them apply to the rest of us but for some reason there is the feeling of it applies more to them than anyone else. Again maybe comes to the maturity of how you handle certain situations. Also leads to exclusion because they are victimised.  P 5: Ya, definitely (there is a relationship between victimisation and inclusion)  P 6: I think victimisation plays an important part in exclusion.   P 6: Victimisation to me is a very funny term because for you to victimise someone you must hold up one rule for everyone else and one rule against that person. If that is happening the person is not necessarily excluded from the group, but he is being. Victimisation comes a person of authority you or a person on an equal level victimising you. people below you cannot victimise you because you can put a stop to it. You get rid of that person or that group. For you to be victimised you have to let it happen in my opinion. You have to, if I’m being a victim. I either allow it, say I’m fine. At this point in time I don’t mind taking the abuse or I’ll say no no no no. what is it that I can do to put a stop to this, and then you deal with that, but you can’t remain a victim. That’s your choice. So in terms of how you feel excluded, you definitely feel more and more excluded because you are victimised.   P 7: I was really trying and putting my effort into it but it wasn’t good enough you know. Um, and that also made me feel a bit excluded from the company because then you realise its business and nobody is your friend in business.   P 7: In one way I did feel a bit victimised, and ah excluded from the company but in every bad there is a good and I took the good side and I’ve actually never been happier.  P 8: I believe that, if I felt someone is feeling victimised or someone abusing their authority or powers or being on a higher level, it would make me feel less included. This is something I identify as a negative, or something I don’t like, again it is like you build up that divide of that feeling of being included.  P 8: Yes. If you feel victimised, it also depends. I don’t know, I need to think about that. If you have been, I think you would feel less included.  P10: The perception that I get is that people do still feel victimised. That doesn’t matter how far people are still afraid to speak their minds. The fact that you have to say it is anonymous and no one is going to hear about it (names are not going to be disclosed in the company) and things like that just points me to the fact that people are still worried that their opinions will not be taken at face value, that there is always going to be something into it. So I still worry that people are going to, still think they are going to be victimised if they are open. Which might stop their voice and opinion of feeling included in decision making. I don’t know how valid it is and have never had an experience of it. You do hear people say “I am not going to say anything because people are going to hear about it”. That survey that we do (diversity and inclusion survey), to me the fact that that is confidential it shouldn’t have to be. You have an opinion, you are asked for it, you should be able to give it without worrying. I would be quite happy to put my name on it and say these are my opinions.   P13: Okay, I was a direct victim of victimisation. It related negatively to my feeling of inclusion and because it was victimisation with my line manager who is very powerful in the business and has quite a lot of clout with what goes on in the business. Fortunately it did not affect my career moves into my current role. I don’t know the impact its going forward but then I didn’t feel included at all, it was a pretty horrible experience.   P16: Certainly there has been a relationship between this victimisation and my experience of inclusion.  P18: Yes I think you will. (feel less included if you were victimised) But if you are victimised you must speak up, if you don’t like something say it. Then sort it out.  P26: Yes, it does make me feel less included, you are only there to do the dirty work to speak and yet you are doing it for everybody and you know certain aspects of the business that other people know but you are not recognised for that you are just there to do the dirty work so that everybody else is sorted out.  P32: If they were victimised they would feel less included.  University of Cape TownAppendix D  294P33: It would, ya. (impact on inclusion)  P38: I have had my own particular experiences with victimisation although I am not living in that right now fortunately. Obviously if you feel victimised you feel you are being treated unfairly, someone is being too harsh, most likely a manager and naturally you would then feel excluded because you are not being treated on par with the rest of the team.   P42: I haven’t seen any level of victimisation but I assume if you have been a victim of victimisation you would probably not perform or try and exclude yourself even more than being excluded.   Code: No relationship between victimisation and perception of inclusion  P10: I don’t think it really affects feeling included (victimisation). I think it affects them giving their opinion about certain things, but don’t think it makes them feel less included.  P23: Not personally. I am a challenger. So it hasn't make me feel excluded.   P25: I don’t think it affects my inclusion because it hasn’t deterred me from saying with I think. But I think from the other’s persons perspective it is difficult because they don’t know what I know  if you know what I mean. They don’t know that they can’t be victimised and if they are victimised that they could actually take you know what I mean and even though I say that to them they are still afraid  because they don’t believe it. I don’t think it will affect my inclusion because I know if anyone ever tried to victimise me I am not just going to lie down and take it because I have rights and I will exercise those rights.  P39: So it doesn’t really make a difference.  P40: No. (victimisation does not affect my inclusion)  Code: Relationship between your view and opinion being valued and perception of  inclusion  P 4: Maybe there is an opportunity to think about what we can do to make everyone feel included. Not so much about an intervention but giving that individual what they need on a day to day basis. That is quite clear to me just from the survey and from the interviews I have done so, it is about each individual, person by person and what you can do to make them each feel included. Sometimes about things, every single person says it is about respect and dignity, about fairness, about manager listening to me and caring about me as a person. Those are the key things. If you can create a culture where those things are enabled we will have more inclusion.  P 6: In our environment the views are not inclusive. There are a few guys that are speakers and whether they represent the view of the majority is still debatable in my opinion. Just because they speak the loudest or the most doesn’t necessarily mean they speak for everybody.  P 6: If your opinion is heard and respected, you feel included.  P 7: I’m actually involved in meetings and I get to learn from them and ya, that makes me feel included.    P 8: Knowing that if you have a different idea or thought and the fact we have put it out there, it obviously means there is a better level of inclusion, if it was not the case you wouldn’t just put your different views or ideas on the table. So it impacts on inclusion in the sense that if there is none of that, if it doesn’t happen where we feel comfortable to put those ideas forward the fact that you can’t put it out there, will make you feel like holding back, like you are not really giving your truth or what you really think. Almost like put a barrier up that divides you from what is out there or the team or whate er the discussion is.  P 9: it makes you feel included because you have a contribution.  P10: Definitely I would because then I would be afraid to voice my opinions. If they didn’t include or respect me they would just disregard it. Where as now I think they do take what I am saying and put it in the pot. P12: you do feel more included if they ask for your opinion and take it seriously.   P13: My point of view is not discarded. It is heard and can change other people’s perceptions. It has fed very well into inclusion.  P20: Views and opinions are not solicited, you have to force people to speak up. this makes people feel less included.  P21: It relates positively.(to our inclusion)  P22: I never felt that, but I think that is probably because of the type of leadership we have enjoyed in the here where I think because of style of the GM he always made a conscious effort to go around the table and make sure everyone’s view are included, even the minority views.   P29: It is very important everyone gets to chance to say what they want to say. If you only ask one or two they will feel included but the rest will feel what is going on here. Basically it is fairness again, every one must get the same opportunities.    P32: are being heard by our bosses and taken care of, some of them aren’t. Bound to happen that way. I feel less included in that matter because it is not strongly related to the situation. They always want to be the ones to come up with ideas and opinions. So in that matter I don’t feel much included, as a team.   ",

    "abstract": "Includes bibliographical references (p. 191-218).A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies was used to answer the following three questions: 1) What is the effect of demographic variables on diversity and inclusion? 2) Is there a relationship between diversity, inclusion and performance in corporate workplaces? 3) What are the components that drive diversity and inclusion in a corporate workplace in South Africa? The research was conducted in a division of a multinational corporation in South Africa. The quantitative analysis was run using the\n\tInclusionIndex(R) survey to get a measurement of diversity and inclusion in the organisation. The qualitative methodology included semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Questions one and two were tested empirically using a combination of analysis of variance and structured equation modelling. Question three was answered using the consolidated findings of the quantitative and qualitative components of the InclusionIndex survey, the semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and insights from related literature",
