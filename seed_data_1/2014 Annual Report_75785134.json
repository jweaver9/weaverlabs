We use the knowledge we have gained over nearly 30 years in the field—along with the trust we have earned from those who work on the ground and those who work at the level of policy—to bring together actions, ideas, and resources.We look for women and men who share a common vision, and connect them to each other. We build bridges between silos of interest, thought, expertise, and effort. We create common spaces where ideas can be exchanged, innovations tried, and progress accelerated.And we join in the collaboration, knowing that success depends not on the abilities of one person or one organization but on the ability of many to work together toward common goals. It’s something that workers, leaders, pragmatists, and visionaries in every field have always known. We’re stronger together.K. SUJATAPRESIDENT/CEOWENDY MANNINGBOARD CHAIRYoung Women’s Giving Council + Polished Pebbles3DETERMINATION + ENERGYGiving Councils link grassroots organizations to funding and the Foundation to new issues, new leaders, and new ideas.Five years ago, Kelly Fair stepped away from corporate success to focus on a different part of the American dream. She wanted to open doors for young women from the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Chicago’s South Side, and to do it, she needed to find a group of women who had made it themselves and were willing to reach back and help a new generation. “We all have answers,” Fair says with conviction. “We can all have an impact on young people. We just need to activate that capacity.”Polished Pebbles does just that. Since its founding, it has paired nearly 1,000 girls with about 400 mentors and volunteers, the kind of strong, smart women who motivated and guided Fair herself when she was a young teen. The program’s hook is to give girls a close-up look at the workplace, from high-end retailers such as Bloomingdales to high-profile corporations such as Blue Cross Blue Shield. “There was one girl in the program who would never get to school before 9 or 9:30, if she came at all,” says Fair. “Well, the day we took them to Microsoft, she was there at 7:45. “Kids want to be successful, and they get that you have to be employed to get there. Through job shadowing, we get kids’ buy-in. They begin to understand why it’s important to work on how they present themselves, their verbal and nonverbal communication.” Fair’s mission, as well as her approach, struck a chord with Dawn Reese, who co-chairs CFW’s Young Women’s Giving Council. “Young minority women find it difficult gaining access to professional mentors. Seasoned guidance can be the difference between healthy decisions and ones that might result in unforgiving career setbacks. Polished Pebbles serves as facilitator to introduce and cultivate relationships.” “The Young Women’s Giving Council understands the importance of organizations like these and strives to foster impactful relationships for our community. Our job is to identify organizations making a difference and support them to the extent that we can.” Reese and her peers may have been first to spot Fair’s work, but they won’t be the last. In October, Polished Pebbles was selected by University of Chicago’s Community Programs Accelerator, which moves promising organizations up the ladder and to the next stage in their growth.5Since its founding, Polished Pebbles has paired nearly 1,000 girls with about 400 mentors and volunteers.Alphawood Foundation CFW+7KNOWLEDGE + WISDOMWhen foundations share knowledge and work together, we can dream bigger, work faster, and achieve more.“It’s not enough to advocate for more money for domestic violence. Wehave to be open and adaptive to change—reframing the issues, finding other vehicles to move the work forward. And one of those other vehicles may be to collaborate with others.”Like program officers across the country, Agnes Meneses, of Chicago’s Alphawood Foundation, encourages partnerships that can enhance grantees’ operations and increase their effectiveness. What sets Meneses—and the foundation she represents—apart is that they are not afraid to follow their own advice.Alphawood has been participating in Chicago Foundation for Women’s quarterly meetings for domestic violence program funders for several years. More recently, it joined forces with CFW to launch a cross-sector collaboration to bring the issue of domestic violence to the forefront with other stakeholders, including health care advocacy organizations, and to explore new funding opportunities to support survivors under the Affordable Care Act.CFW“Both managed care and Medicaid may yield income for domestic violence services, especially counseling and screening,” says CFW president and CEO K. Sujata. “Our work is still in the early stages, but by collaborating together at the level of policy, we have the potential to bring new dollars into the mix.”Funders often keep an eye on changes in the field and how others’ grantmaking complements or overlaps with their own. But in 2013, Alphawood decided to go one step further. It decided to take a closer look at its own domestic violence portfolio through the eyes of Chicago Foundation for Women.“We want to become better at supporting the work of our grantees,” says Meneses. “We were looking for a different set of perspectives, not just on our grantees but on the field as a whole. CFW was a logical choice. ”For Alphawood, the goal of the ongoing partnership is to gain useful insights and identify potential synergies, not to make wholesale changes 9As generalists, we see how those areas—housing, workforce, health, social justice—intersect with domestic violence and the need for a more collective approach to support survivors.to program funding. To that end, CFW is now reviewing Alphawood’s docket of grant applications and conducting site visits. As part of the initial engagement, CFW staff also prepared a formal scan of the sector, overall: public and private funding, existing services, unmet needs and challenges, and potential opportunities. Alphawood’s 15 domestic violence grantee organizations can benefit from the partnership, as well. All 15 now have access to CFW’s capacity building services, such as boot camp and advocacy training, along with an opportunity to make connections with agencies outside their sector.“We fund in a range of issue areas,” says Meneses. “As generalists, we see how those areas—housing, workforce, health, social justice—intersect with domestic violence and the need for a more collective approach to support survivors. Part of what we hope to do is to help grantees take a step back and see that bigger picture, too, then bring back those insights to their organizations.” CLAIM CGLA+11DEPTH + BREADTHThe Enterprise Fund gives organizations doing good work the support they need to explore the options for restructuring or collaboration. When Chicago Legal Advocacy for Incarcerated Mothers (CLAIM)— a small agency with an outsize reputation in the field—found itself struggling to manage the day-to-day business of being a nonprofit, its board made an unusual decision. With support from Chicago Foundation for Women’s Enterprise Fund, the independent 501(c)(3) became part of Cabrini Green Legal Aid (CGLA).CLAIM and CGLA’s missions were complementary. The cultural “fit” seemed right; the two agencies had long known and respected each other’s work. And everyone realized that in the long run, the merger would save costs, money that could be better employed providing services.Few suspected that in the short run—the very short run, as it happens—the merger would also save lives.“Noel,” a mother of six, had contacted CLAIM a few days before she was due to be released from prison. She knew that the Illinois Department of Corrections website would list her address when she was released. Now, she was afraid that her husband would use that information to find her and kill her. He had been convicted of sexually assaulting her, and of home invasion with unlawful restraint. He had molested their 13-year-old daughter. Over and over, he had made it clear that she and the children “belonged” to him. And in just 10 days, he would know where to find them.On its own, CLAIM might have been powerless to help. One by one, representatives from corrections, the office of the attorney general, and the governor’s office insisted that their “hands were tied.” As part of CGLA, however, CLAIM had a new reserve of assets to tap: longstanding contacts at Chicago’s most powerful law firms. A call was made, and the very next day two pro bono attorneys from Dentons began drafting a federal injunction. On July 2, the day after the merger between CGLA and CLAIM became official, IDOC agreed to withhold Noel’s address.“CLAIM has really opened our eyes to the effects that involvement with the criminal justice system has on a woman’s life and on the life of her children,” says CGLA executive director Gretchen Slusser. “So we couldn’t be more pleased with the way things are turning out, in terms of the success that we’re seeing. “We’re continuing our advocacy work, but at the same time we are giving more women the opportunity to connect with an attorney, particularly in central Illinois, and we can offer more direct representation in court.” “The net result is this: vulnerable families—women and their children—are getting more of the resources they need to make it through.” BVulnerable women and their children are getting more of the resources they need to make it through.PHILANTHROPY THAT WORKS24,799  FEMALE3,978  MALEOUR GRANTMAKING  IN 2014 HAS DIRECTLY IMPACTED AN ESTIMATED2014 CHICAGO FOUNDATION  FOR WOMEN GRANTED OUT$2,113,731      99ORGANIZATIONSGRANTSTO SUPPORTIN FYISSUE AREAS3150FOR HEALTH VIOLENCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT23% 26% 51%28,819$24MILLION3,000 GRANTS TOTALINGSINCE 1985 WE HAVE GIVEN MORE THAN42 GENDER NON-CONFORMINGWOMEN  + GIRLS1591812x355100=$94,750New investors in women and girls created100 women enriched to be philanthropists granted $94,7501189512 CFW grantees mobilized more than 355 community members to advocate for 26 policy effortsCommittee volunteers, including staff and boardnumber of Women Leadership Initiative participants over the year in Core Concepts, Women of Color Collaborative,  Advocacy academy and Board Boot CampJoin us and invest in women and girls–put your time, talent, and treasure where it is most needed and has the greatest potential return. 17We are stronger together.WWW.CFW.ORG/DONATEDONOR LISTINDIVIDUAL DONORS$100,000+Lucia Woods LindleyThe Estate of Norris “Mike” Love$20,000-$99,999Marjorie Craig BentonJames and Brenda GruseckiGinny HoltNancy Juda and Jens BraschMarcena W.
