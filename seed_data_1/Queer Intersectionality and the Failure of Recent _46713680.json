Transforming the Legal Landscape of Queer Lives ............................................................................. 120 Amidst the juridical heterosexisml of our legal system, the few successful lesbian and gay cases stand out as brilliant, hopeful harbingers of the future. With good cause, lesbian and gay people have hailed state cases that indicate Bowers v. Hardwick2 has not contaminated all American courts.3 Although termed \"victories\" for the lesbian and gay community, several recent New York cases exclude many queer4 legal needs. Four cases, Braschi v. Stahl as so^.,^ In the Matter of the Adoption of Evan,6 M.A.B. v. R.B.7 and Thomas S. v. Robin Y.,8 embody the law's 1.

State cases also hold great importance for lesbian and gay rights litigation since the Reagan-Bush administration's federal judicial appointments have reduced the possibility of succession federal courts.

This essay will question the value of these decisions as victories for our community. Queer identity fundamentally intersects with other marginal identities of individuals and communities and serves as the central theoretical basis for my critique of these cases. Creating queer coinmunities with widely varying legal needs specific to various classes, races, gender and sexual identifications. Given the breadth of marginal identities, an analysis of these cases will demonstrate the value of these cases to certain queers over others. While recognizing the progressive aspects of these cases, the narrowness of these lesbian and gay \"victories\" puts their status into question. The intersectionality of class, race, sexual practice and gender preference and an implicit interrogation of the value of law in social change inform this critique. The marginalizing and essentializing tendencies of litigation reveal it to be a flawed technique for change for queer communities. Reliance on litigation for the direction of the movement is dangerous because these essentializing and marginalizing aspects of litigation have the potential to further divide and weaken queer political strength. Litigation should follow strategy, not define it. Part I of this essay will introduce the queer theories underlying my critique and will outline the discrete positioning of lesbian and gay identity and community10 which labels these cases \"victories.\" The intersectionality of queer identity is the key blind spot in the litigation model. The queer continuum, a re-conceptualization of Adrienne Rich's lesbian continuum, delineates the spectrum of queer identity. Part I1 will explore the facts, issues and holdings of these four cases. My examination of these cases will reveal how they grant some rights to \"but- 9. \"Cases from within the community often center on the very issues heterosexuals take for granted.

In addition to the post-Harmvick importance of state cases, the visibility of New york's lesbian and gay community, perhaps the world's largest, also makes these cases so prominent. 10. I use the phrase \"lesbian and gay\" here in some opposition to \"queer\" because of the relatively legitimized nature of the ''lesbian and gay\" community. Common usage of related terms is also informative. See, e.g., Lea Delaria, Address at the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Rights (April 25, 1993) (stating 'What's the difference between a lesbian and a dyke? Thirty thousand dollars a year!\") I also use the word \"community\" rather than \"communities\" because the discrete notion of lesbian and gay identity also posits a discrete lesbian and gay community rather than multiple communities. Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev. Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 85 1994 86 LAW & SEXUALITY [Vol. 4 fory' queers, who, \"but-for\" their being lesbian or gay, would be \"perfect citizens.\"ll I will discuss how the rules and applications of these cases either exclude some queer communities or address issues irrelevant to other communities. The communities whose interest I specifically address are poor queers, queers of color, sexual subversives, and gender subversive queers. These limitations should figure prominently in the consideration of litigation's role in queer activism. In Part Ill, I conclude by outlining the implications of this critique for the relationship between queer communities and litigation. In this section, I will first establish that queer identity intersects with sex, race, class, sexual practice and gender preference. A queer legal program should account for this multiplicity. Adrienne Rich's lesbian continuum broadens our notion of community, providing the basis for a queer critique of these cases and for political action respecting difference. Finally, I critique a discrete notion of lesbian and gay identity promulgated by litigation that ignores the intersectionality of queer identity. A. \"Queer\" as a Category The term \"queer\" often engenders controversy, perhaps owing to the radical nature of those who most notably brought it into use in the lesbian and gay communities, ACT-UP12 and Queer Nation.13 Its 1 1.

Indeed, ACT-UP revived the radicalism of lesbian and gay communities that has led to the exploration of more radical identities such as \"queer.\" \"What we are seeing among the young who make up ACT UP is once again gay men and lesbian women acting in concert, welcoming and appreciating each other's differentness, and also welcoming minority people. Beyond that change in personnel, what ACT UP has discovered in the process of struggle is the full extent of entrenched privilege which characterizes our society . . . Because of those insights gathered during ACT UP'S struggles, I think we may yet see the birth of a new gay movement which is once more radically oriented.\" Martin Duberman, Historian, Address to Ceremony Inaugurating Lesbian and Gay Pride and History Month in New York City, June 1, 1989, in DOUGLAS CRIVP with ADAM ROLSTON, AIDS D ~ O G W H I C S  (1990).

Its historically negative meaning calls into question the accuracy of categories themselves by complicating the signs of positive and negative identification. \"The minute you say 'queer' you are necessarily calling into question exactly what you mean when you say it.\"l5 \"Queer\" as a political category avoids the essentialist meaning often presumed by the terms \"lesbian and gay.\"l6 This essentialism has been much criticized by academics and legal scholars as both inaccurate17 and destructive.18 Normative categories must be context-driven in order to hold any meaning. \"Queer,\" unlike \"lesbian and gay\" does not merely describe sexual practices, but a destabilization of heterosexual hegemony.19 \"llr]he term 'queer' in its openness . . . suggests the truly polyrnorphous nature of our difference, of difference within the lesbian and gay community . . .

Queer Intersectionality A lot of times when you're black and gay, you don't know whether the discrimination is due to your blackness or your gayness.21 Bell Hooks, in Ain't I A Woman?, denounced the white women's movement for universalizing white notions of c'woman,\" thereby erasing the existence of black women.22 Similarly, discussing the parties in these cases as lesbian or gay without specifying other aspects of their social position implies that they occupy a universal position. The effect of these false universals is to erase other queers and to ignore their very different experiences. Black women face discrimination both as Blacks and as women. They also face discrimination specific to their subject position, which cannot be analyzed merely from a \"Black\" perspective or from a \"woman's\" perspective. Kimberle Crenshaw describes this collision of identities and discriminations: Black women are sometimes excluded from feminist theory and antiracist policy discourse because both are predicated on a discrete set of experiences that often does not accurately reflect the interaction of race and gender. These problems of exclusion cannot be solved simply by including Black women within an already established analytical structure. Because the intersectional experience is greater than the sum of racism and sexism, any analysis that does not take intersectionality into account cannot sufficiently address the particular manner in which Black women are subordinated. Thus, for feminist theory and antiracist policy discourse to embrace the experiences and concerns of Black women, the entire framework that has been used as a basis for \"translating women's experience\" 21. Ronald Prince, quoted in Lena Williams, Blacks Rejecting Gay Rights As a Battle Equal to Theirs, N.Y.

The multiplicity of the discrimination that queers face is thus greater than anti-lesbian and anti-gay discrimination. Queer identity implicates opposition to these discriminations: \"Being queer . . . means everyday fighting oppression; homophobia, racism, misogyny, the bigotry of religious hypocrites and our own self-hatred.-25 Just as feminist q d  antiracist agendas fail Black women by centering on femaleness or Blackness, so the liberal lesbian and gay position fails by identifying the community solely on same-sex p m e r  choice, ignoring the class, race, ethnicity, sexual and gender identity diversity of the queer community. Since \"the homophobia 23. Kimberle Crenshaw, Dernarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex. A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics, 1989 U. CM. LEGALE 139,140. Crenshaw describes the b i d  Black women face by liberation movements: \"Black women are regarded either as too much like women or Blacks and the compounded nature of their experience is absorbed into the collective experiences of eithergroup or as too different, in which case Black women's Blackness or femaleness sometimes has placed their needs and perspectives at the margin of the feminist and Black liberationist agendas . . . . While it could be argued that this failure represents an absence of political will to include Black women, I believe that it reflects an uncritical and disturbiig acceptance of dominant ways of thinking about discrimination.\" Id at 150. Though I quote extensively from this brilliant piece of legal scholarship, a closer familiarity with Crenshaw's argument would certainly enrich an understanding of my argument 24. My calculation here that most queers are intersectional is based on an assumption of parity between lesbians and gays. Various studies provide contrary evidence to this assumption. See, e.g., ALFRED C. KNY ET AL, SEX BEHAVIOR IN THE HUMAN (1948); ALFRED C. WEY, SEXBEHAMORINTHEHUMANF~AE (1953). However, given the problematic essentialist bases for such statistics, I prefer to rely on my experience which indicates some degree of parity between lesbians and gays. I also cannot ignore differences between lesbians and gays that might impact on such perceptions. Manuel Castells, urban geographer states: \"Lesbians, unlike gay men, tend not to concentrate in a given territory, but establish social and interpersonal networks.\" MANUEL CASIEI~S, 'I& CrrY AND THE GRASSROOTS: A ( 3 0 s - C U L m  THEORY OF URBAN S m M o m m m  140 (1983). 25. ANONYMOUS QUEERS, QUEERS READ THIS (1990) reprinted in Rubenstein, supra note 13. Anonymous Queers further describes queer identity: \"Being queer means leading a different sort of life. It's not about the mainstream, profit margins, patriotism, patriarchy, or beiig assimilated. It's not about executive directors, privilege and elitism. It's about being on the margins, defining ourselves; it's about gender-fuck and' secrets, what's beneath the belt and deep inside the heart; it's about the night. Being queer is \"grass roots\" because we know that everyone of us, every body, every cunt, every heart, and ass and dick is a world of pleasure waiting to be explored. Everyone of us is a world of infinite possibility.\" Id at 46. Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev.

Focusing on the intersectionality of queer identity might permit lesbian and gay legal strategists to address lesbian and gay legal issues without ignoring the unique way in which women, people of color, poor people, sexually subversive people, cross-gendered people and others face anti-queer discrimination. Attention to these intersectionalities may help provide the largely white, middle-class lesbian and gay legal community with the perspective to litigate for a far broader sense of community. C. The Queer Continuum Intersectionality's inclusion of specific identity differences raises inherently personal issues. Social change should reflect the queer politicization of personal identities. The lesbian continuum, which comprises \"the multitude of identities which constitute lesbian existence,\"\" helps reconceptualize the queer continuum. \"Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life.\"28 Compulsory heterosexuality, the system which forces women to define themselves in relation to men and erases lesbian existence, is a \"political in~titution.\"~g Through compulsory heterosexuality, men dictate women's (heter0)sexuality and thus prevent them from centering their expression in womanhood. The lesbian continuum is the range of women's resistance to compulsory heterosexuality. The queer continuum is thus the range of sexual identities which subvert compulsory heterosexuality. Rather than focus on women's resistance as does the lesbian continuum, the queer continuum centers on the resistance of people of all sexes. However, several similarities between the queer continuum and the lesbian continuum provide a useful comparison. 26.

Inclusion The queer continuum includes a wide range of people who resist compulsory heterosexuality. My goal in using Rich's model is to expand queer identity to many people. Not just lesbian and gay people belong to the queer continuum; it includes all sexual minorities. Many of us are dykes, fags, bisexuals, radical feminists and other subversive heterosexuals, transvestites, transsexuals, poor queers, Black queers, Asian-American queers, Latino queers, homos, drag queens, leather queens and dykes, muscle queens, lipstick lesbians, .bull dykes, gay women, etc. The vast intersectionality and diversity of queer identities all situate along the queer continuum; extending to those who do not identify with it. 2. Identification The lesbian continuum includes women who behave homosocially but do not identify themselves as lesbians. The queer continuum also describes people who do not identify as queer but nonetheless subvert traditional gender and sexual identities.30 The breadth of queer existence, like lesbian existence, draws on resistant acts and not exclusively on self-identification. Thus, even some of the men who have tearoom sex, who might loathe the word \"queer\" and even \"gay,\"31 are queer because they commit acts of sexual subversion against compulsory heterosexuality. Thus, even the demonic Roy Cohn32 and J. 30. Radical scholars, like radical activists, initially saw \"queer\" as a word which could describe women and men, whites and people of color, muscle boys and drag queens. However, I recognize that many women and people of color feel \"queer\" erases their more intersectional identities as \"gay\" did and do not identify as such. However, I have found no word which replaces the theoretical value of \"queer\" in applying subversion to a broad spectrum of identities. > 31. Loathing lesbian or gay identity is not necessarily a condition of being closeted. See, cf: Mark A. Fajer, Can Two Real Men Eat Quiche Together?

Nonerasure and Intersectionality Facially, intersectionality and the queer continuum contradict one another. While intersectionality focuses on difference, the unity of a continuum might imply the erasure of difference. However, variation is a fundamental part of the continuum: otherwise it would be entirely unitary. Political unity through the respect of difference, a fundamental strategy for subordinated communities; might be furthered by combining these two concepts, by building on Rich's continuum precisely to avoid collapsing different queer communities into a unitary queer identity. \"To equate lesbian existence with male homosexuality because each is stigmatized is to erase female reality once again.\"34 The queer continuum's intersectional focus ideally includes the specific needs of various communities. However, \"[tlhe risk is that queer theoretical work will mirror queer doctrinal work in perpetuating the invisibility of lesbians.\"35 Respecting intersectionality within the continuum might avoid perpetuating this invisibility. Although many different types of people are queer, their queerness does not erase their singularity. The queer continuum invokes a broad community encompassing a multiplicity of identities. It permits us to envision this community without erasing the intersectionality of separate identities. The recognition of difference often leaves little space for broad political action. But the queer continuum, connecting the personal to the political, permits queer intersectionality to surpass the level of difference into a potential program for change. 33.

Empowerment The queer continuum unites a broad range of disempowered communities, surpassing the \"lesbian and gay\" community's relatively limited political reach. By including occasionally subversive people and people who face intersectional discrimination, the queer continuum def~nes .broad resistance to compulsory heterosexuality. This political constitution of many subversive identities may broaden notions of community in an empowering way. Respecting other intersecting identities would help create the trust necessary for alliances with other subordinate groups. It is through the lens of this broad-based community that I will analyze lesbian and gay rights litigation. D. Litigation and the Limits of Liberalism Courts recognize targets of discrimination solely on the basis of belonging to a specific protected class. As Professor Crenshaw asserts: \"Because the scope of antidiscrimination law is so limited, sex iind race discrimination have come to be defined in terms of the experiences of those who are privileged but for their racial or sexual characteristics.\"36 In her discussion of DeGrqffenreid v. General Motors?7 she exposes a federal district court's inability to perceive intersectional discrimination: \"Under this view, black women are protected only to the extent that their experiences coincide with those of either of the two groups plack men and white women].\"38 Similarly, courts considering lesbian and gay issues only look at the issue of sexual orientation.39 To fulfjll the requirements of the court, lesbian and gay litigation requires a client who, but for that trait, would not have fallen victim to discrimination. Indeed, Ruthann Robson has coined the term \"but-for queef' as someone who, \"but for'' their being queer, would be perfect30 \"But-for queers\" constitute the ideal parties to a test case, because someone facing more than just sexual orientation discrimination might confuse the issue before the court. \"But-for\" queer litigants permit the courts to focus on 36.

The widely used term \"sexual orientation\" implies sexuality to be a fixed identity, a notion contested by many sexual subversives in the queer community. For them, the term \"sexual preference,\" while outdated, might more accurately express the fluidity of sexualities. 40. Robson, supra note 11. Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev.

Courts thereby follow other juridical norms that exclude on the basis of class, sex, race, sexual practice and gender performance. While \"other\" queers may benefit from such litigation, their exclusion from lesbian and gay litigation means that intersectional discrimination is not addressed by that litigation. p]he measure of a just society is not how it treats people who look like Ozzie and Hamet.

Washington-by Way of Stonewall, N.Y. TIMES, Apr. 27, 1993, at ,420. Because this editorial, responding to the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, so eloquently defends the position I take up in this essay, I quote the full text: The modem gay rights movement started a quarter of a century ago, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a cross-dressers' bar in Greenwich Village. The incident led to three days of civil disobedience, much of it by men in drag. Stonewall convinced gay men and lesbians that they were under attack and that they needed to organize for political action and demonstrations, like the one last weekend in Washington. This march was Ozzie and Haniet compared with the Stonewall days or even with the annual gay pride parade in New York. As The Los Angeles Times's Bettina Boxall wrote: \"They wanted to show to America that they were 'regular' people, the kind that live next door, go to work every day, and pay their taxes.\" While the march included the exotic-some bare-breasted women, transvestites and people clad in leather gear-for the most part, the demonstrators were conventional, orderly, and well behaved.\" \"Ordinary\" and 'The People Next Door\" were mantras of the weekend, as though the right of full citizenship depends on how one chooses to dress. It doesn't. And it's a dangerous idea The fixation on \"normalcy\" is understandable given how gay Americans have been demonized in recent years. But the measure of a just society is not how it treats people who look like Ozzie and Haniet. That's the easy part. A just society must offer the same full citizenship to the flamboyant dressers in last weekend's parade as it does to those who looked \"just like the people next door.\" Id.

Queer Legal Nee& Awareness of queer intersectionality should reshape our conception of queer legal needs. The focus of lesbian and gay legal needs, the extension of rights to people without regard to sexual orientation, does not necessarily answer queer legal needs. Intersectional queers might face exclusion by other forces in the law, such as classism, sexism, or racism. Their legal priorities might differ from those of \"but- for\" queers. Poor queers might not find inclusion by courts looking at education, profession, and property in evaluating their claims. Their access to litigation is itself limited. Their ability to conceal behavior rejected by the courts is reduced32 Economic inequality leaves many queers of color facing this same classism. In addition, their family structures and cultural attitudes about homosexuality often differ from those of white people. Furthermore, queers of color might define their queerness differently from white people and from each other33 Since manifestations of homophobia and heterosexism are culturally contingent, . remedies countering white heterosexism might not address this discrimination. Courts relying on traditional sexual and gender norms might deny sexual and gender subversive litigants and ignore their priorities. Their priorities in the recognition of relationships by courts may diier as well. These queer legal needs therefore find little relief in the courts. This treatment by the courts cannot be entirely disassociated 42. See, erg., White v. Thompson 569 So. 2d 1181 (Miss. 1990), in which a lesbian mother's use of marijuana was cited by the courts in declaring her neglectful. Had she and her lover been able to afford more than a trailer home, their privacy might have prevented the court from attaining such information. For a more extensive discussion of this case, see infra note 102 and accompanying text 43.

Lesbian and Gay \"Victories \" Because my critique of each of the following \"lesbian and gay legal victories7' is necessarily based on multiple perspectives which often merge, I will summarize the cases before criticizing them. 1. Braschi v. Stahl Assocs. Co. Braschi is perhaps the most prominent case in New York dealing with lesbian and gay issues, partly because it was the first case in which New York's highest court recognized lesbian and gay relationships.47 Upon the death of tenant Leslie Blanchard, Stahl Associates tried to evict his lover, Miguel Braschi. Rent control laws, designed to protect tenants from exorbitant rents, have non-eviction provisions for co-habiting family members. Braschi sued to inherit the rent-controlled tenancy, presenting 44.

See generally, e.g., Ess~x HEMP=, CERFMOMES: PROSE AND POW (1992); Robert F. Reid Phan; supra note 44. 46. Some may claim that these interests are separate from distinctly queer interests. As I point out in my discussion of Queer categories, my purpose is specifically to call into question the notion that \"queer\" or \"lesbian and gay\" legal needs are distinct from those of other marginalized P\"-'PS. 47. Indeed, the front page of THE NEW YORK 'hm proclaimed the victory, the first time since Hardwick that coverage of a lesbian and gay rights case graced its cover. See Phillip S. Gutis, New York Court Dejines Family to Include Homosexuals, N.Y. l ' h ~ s ,  July 7, 1991, at Al. William B. Rubenstein, of the American Civil Liberties Union Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, who argued the case before the Court of Appeals, stated: 'Today's decision is a ground-breaking victory for lesbians and gay men.. . It marks the most important single step forward in American law towards legal recognition of lesbian and gay relationships.\" Id \"We heralded Braschi as a tremendous breakthrough, not only because the Court of Appeals recognized a gay or lesbian couple as family, but also because of its ground-breaking language dismissing genetic history and fictitious legal distinctions as the only basis on which families may be defined.\" Paula Ettelbrick, June 1993 L E ~  TO THE LESBIAN/GAY L.

The Cow of Appeals approved several criteria for a same-sex couple to be considered \"family\" for rent control purposes38 For tenancy inheritance, cohabitation was the most fundamental requirement. The Court put forth the following factors as other indicators of a relationship deserving the protection of the non-eviction clause: \"exclusivity and longevity of the relationship, the level of emotional and financial commitment, the manner in which the parties have conducted their everyday lives and held themselves out to society, and the reliance placed upon one another for daily family services.\"49 Despite the specificity of these factors, they are merely indicators, not requirements of proving a relationship to be sufficiently family-like.50 Having established the indicators for an appropriate test, the Court evaluated the BraschiBlanchard couple. Various aspects of their lives so closely mirrored the criteria that one suspects the test was designed to fit the couple.51 After evaluating the Braschi-Blanchard couple's relationship, the Court granted Braschi noneviction protection and tenancy inheritance, finding him to have been one of \"two adult lifetime partners whose relationship is long term and characterized by an emotional and financial commitment and interdependence.\"52 2. In the Matter of the Adoption of Evan In the Matter of the Adoption of Evan was also hailed as an important victory for the lesbian and gay community.53 It was the first 48. The court arrived at this interpretation of the rent control law using common definitions of family from Webster's Dictionary and Ballantine's and Black's Law Dictionaries. Braschi v.

Diane F. and Valerie C. had been in a committed long term relationship since 1978. In 1985, they decided to have a child, and Valerie was artificially inseminated with a friend's sperm.54 Since Evan's birth, Valerie and Diane had shared all parenting responsibilities. In 1991, Diane petitioned to adopt Evan.55 The court employed two family law tests to decide the case, the best interests test and the nexus test. The best interest test determines which available option would be in the child's best interest. While noting financial and emotional reasons favoring the adoption, the court clearly viewed the legitimization of Evan's family as primary. \"As he matures, his connection with two involved, loving parents will not be a relationship seen as outside the law, but one sustained by the ongoing, legal recognition of an approved, court- ordered adoption.\"56 The court then employed the second test, the nexus test, set forth in New York in Guinan v. Guinan?7 in which the homosexuality of a parent becomes relevant only when it adversely affects the welfare of the child.

R.B. is a 1986 case in which a gay father gained custody of his son.61 The parties married in 1970, separated after the husband came out to his wife in 1978, and divorced in 1984.62 The mother received custody of the three children despite her failing health, though the order required her to reside in the state. When M.A.B., the mother, applied to the court to permit her to relocate to Florida with the children, R.B., the father, cross-motioned for custody of the oldest child, B., and to oppose his ex-wife's move to Florida with the two other children.63 B., a \"poor school citizen,\" had failed and cut many classes, engaged in fights, \"mooned\" his class, and had stolen money from his mother to buy marijuana and alcohol.64 When B. moved in with his father, .his behavior improved according to his teachers and principal.65 The court employed the best interests test, and determined that R.B.'s stability and close contact with school officials had a positive effect on B.66 Furthermore, the court determined that M.A.B.'s illness67 rendered her incapable of raising B. Living with her elderly parents because of her illness, her application to move was viewed as tantamount to awarding custodial responsibility to her parents.68 Petition of Roberta Achtenberg [Cal.Super.Ct., San Francisco Co.

[They] rejected the request, and cut off contact between Mr. Steel and the child.\"82 The Family Court found that establishing paternity, even if it were biologically accurate, would be inequitable so long after birth.83 Family Court Judge Kaufmann's best interests analysis found that to Ry, Steel had been no closer than other family friends; he was an outsider attacking her family's security.84 Determining the contact between Steel and Ry not significant enough to declare him a parent,85 the Family Court denied the petition to establish paternity and visitation rights. Overturning this ruling, the Appellate Division found that Steel's contact with the child as her biological father required an order of filiation be granted.86 Although this case has divided lesbian and gay legal activists,87 the ensuing debate has infused the reception of this case with a rare but useful critical discussion. This critical discussion prevents this case from receiving the Braschi-like victory reception. The conflicting holdings of the New York County Family Court and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court point to the complexity of the use of the word \"victory\" in this case.

Responding to his success at the Appellate level, Steel told The New York Times: \"It's so satisfying after all these years of struggle to maintain this relationship to see a court recognize the diverse nature of our families and honor the different relationships we create.\"gl The essentialist notion that lesbian and gay communities need on alternative family structure reduces the viability of differing, even opposing, queer relationships. In this case, the adversarial nature of the law requires adherence to one or another competing vision of \"lesbian and gay'' relationships. Recognition of the law's limitations in meeting queer needs might permit queer legal activists to avoid feuding over such a construct. As Justice Betty Weinberg Ellerin noted in her Appellate Division dissent, objective legal rules have limited application to \"the complexity of human relationships that permeate this case and the millions of households that maintain alternate family life styles.\"92 C.

In this manner, the courts create rules from these facts that reflect a lifestyle which many queers cannot or do not wish to live. Viewing these cases as unproblematic victories presumes lesbian and gay identity to be fixed. In this section, I will analyze the cases from the perspectives of various queer communities excluded by social position or subversive identity. After describing the first and broadest exclusion relating to class, I will examine limits relating to queers of color, and sexual and gender subversives.94 I will thus explore several limitations from different queer perspectives:95 1) how the facts in these cases may restrict future application, 2) how the fruits of legal victory are inaccessible to some queers, and 3) how some queers may not want access to the legal institutions of marriage and family. 1. Poor Queers As in other areas of the law,96 poor people face a great deal of exclusion in lesbian and gay rights litigation. In Braschi, the Court of Appeals indicated financial interdependence to be one criterion for its determination that the couple merited rent control protection. To determine financial commitment, the court examined several aspects of the lives of the BlanchardBraschi couple. They shared safe deposit boxes, joint savings and checking accounts, joint credit cards, and even 93. Crenshaw, supra note23, at 152. 94. While I address these categories, the broadness of the queer continuum opens up many possible queer critiques of the law or these cases. See, e.g., Harper, supra note 15. 95. As a white, middle-class gay man, I cannot speak from a position of classist or racist subordination. Subverting norms of sexual practice and gender performance, as well as my activism and studies constitute the principal experience which grounds this article's critique. 96. See, e.g., San Antonio Indep. School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 41 1 U.S. 1 (1973) (finding that poor residents of San Antonio did not have an equal protection claim for school funding because, \"the 'poor' cannot be identified or defined in customary equal protection terms. . . .\" Id at 19.

Yet the reality of most lesbians is that they do not live in Braschi-like comfort with a rent controlled apartment on the Upper East Side, sharing the keys to their safe deposit boxes.. .\"99 Women's generally lower pay and the double burden lesbian couples face in this respectloo emphasize the veracity of this assertion. However, the lesbians of Evan and Thomas S. v. Robin Y. escape the double-bind of lesbian poverty. Their class positions figure quite prominently in both trial level decisions. Surrogate Preminger pronounced the class position of Evan's mothers in the fist paragraph of facts: \"Diane, age 39, is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics and an attending physician at a respected teaching hospital. Valerie, age 40, holds a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and teaches at a highly regarded private school.\"l0l The importance of finances in the application of the best interest test may limit the breadth of this victory. An important reason for granting the adoption was that Evan would receive inheritance and medical and educational benefits from Diane and her family. Poor queers might not satisfy a court relying on such material comfort to grant the adoption. Young and Russo are, according to the opinion, in a similarly grand financial position. Professionally, both mothers as well as the sperm donor are successful attomeys.102 Young owns and manages the Manhattan apartment building in which her family lives,l03 and the couple jointly owns a home in upstate New York.

These cases' facts and holdings exclude poor queers in other ways. Most fundamentally, litigation requires financial resources. In Evan, the mothers chose to spend the money needed to formalize her adoption. While in Brhchi, M.A.B., and Thomas S., the victorious lesbian or gay parties did not commence the action, they had the means to hire a lawyer to defend their cases successfully. Poor queers most likely could not even afford to defend against Thomas S., much less to succeed in part by the graces of Manhattan property, professional privilege, and private education. Beyond litigation itself, poor queers generally do not have the money to share the financial securities that might serve as evidence in a proceeding following Braschi's rule. Many queers are not professionals, as are Young, Valerie and Diane. Few queers have mothers who could pay the Manhattan private school tuition for their children. And even fewer queers have the employment benefits that Surrogate Prerninger cites in permitting Diane to adopt. The poverty of the plaintiff in White v.

Ms. White lost custody of her children to her ex-husband's parents because she was \"unfit, morally and otherwise . . . \"106 to raise the children. She and her lover, Phyllis Hasberger, lived together in a trailer with their children.107 Because White received no child support from her alcoholic ex-husband, she worked late hours in a convenience store to support her children, leaving the children unsupervised in the morning while she slept.108 Had she sufficient resources, she would have been able to pay for a more effective defense and a baby-sitter to prevent accusations of \"neglect.\" Although the rules in Braschi, Evan, and Thomas S. do not specifically require wealth, class may play a role in interpreting these rules, excluding many queers.

Queers of Color Queers of color are not mentioned in the cases, with Miguel Braschi the only possible exception, his first name suggesting a possible Latino heritage. Although race doesn't appear as explicitly relevant in these decisions, its absence indicates a notion of universality that implies whiteness. What is relevant is that the facts of these cases indicate technologies and living situations which, because of economic and social racism and cultural differences, are not often available to many people of color.'09 Given the cultural contingency of relationships, responding to Black and Latino heterosexual family structures110 might lead queers of color to relationship structures different from those of white queers. According to Crenshaw, the use of race-objective tones often indicates an exclusion of people of color. \"The authoritative universal voice [is] usually white male subjectivity masquerading as non-racial, non- gendered objectivity . . . .\"I1 One of the effects of \"race-neutral\" lesbian and gay identities and legal needs is the construction of \"lesbians and gays\" as white.l12 The intersection of race and sexuality also does not appear in these cases.

Coming out of the closet to confront sexual oppression has not necessarily given white males the motivation or insight to transcend their racist conditioning. This failure (or reluctance) to transcend is costing the gay and lesbian community the opportunity to become a powerful force for creating real social changes that reach beyond issues of sexuality. It has fostered much of the distrust that permeates the relations between the Black and white communities. And finally, it erodes the possibility of forming meaningful, powerful coalitions.113 The whiteness of these cases and of much lesbian and gay legal work furthers the racism within our communities. And, as Hemphill points out, the exclusion of Black queers and other queers of color114 prevents the forming of coalitions which might create significant social change. 3.

Sexual subversives are those who explore and celebrate their sexualities. In addition to those who do not choose lengthy relationships, monogamy, or marriage for various reasons, many queers explore radical forms of sexuality: public sex (parks, tearooms, \"adult bookstores,\" backrooms), anonymous sex, group sex, promiscuity, sado-masochism, and role-playing.ll7 Michel Foucault described queer sexual liberation: \"[A] whole new art of sexual practice develops which tries to explore all the internal possibilities of sexual conduct. You find emerging in places like San Francisco and New York what might be called laboratories of sexual experimentation.\"ll8 Many queers do not have or seek to have lengthy relationships. Some queers do not even couple, or do so in ways which would be unrecognizable to these courts. Although some queer couples are monogamous, many view monogamy as a fundamental obstacle to sexual liberation. \"Gay male promiscuity should be seen . . . as a positive model of how sexual pleasures might be pursued by and granted to everyone if those pleasures were not confined within the narrow limits of institutionalized sexuality.\"llg These courts attempt to determine the presence of emotional ties by using indicia presupposing a 116.

Three aspects of coupling are addressed in these cases: exclusivity, longevity, and similarity to a marital lifestyle. They also look at the parents' sexuality to determine the quality of their parenthood. I will clarify the language of the courts regarding these issues before exploring the impact on sexual subversives. a. Monogamy Courts rely on monogamy as the strongest and most unique indicator of stability. In all four decisions, the courts refer to the duration of the relationship. Both lesbian couples were together fourteen years at the time of the respective decisions.121 The BraschiBlanchard couple had been together for ten years,l22 and the R.B. couple for eight years.123 Although the criteria in Braschi are to be regarded as but part of a totality, this totality requires an assimilationist sexual behavior of lesbians and gays, one which compromises the lesbian and gay challenge to established sexual and romantic structures. In Braschi, M.A.B., and Thomas S., the \"exclusivity,\" or monogamy, of the relationship is given a central role in demonstrating commitment.124 The Braschi court establishes exclusivity as a criteria to test a relationship for rent control protection.125 \"Exclusivity\" also appeared to motivate the Family Court's decision to respect the validity of Young's and Russo's relationship. \"Respondent Robin Y[oung] and Sandra R[usso] met in 1979. They established and have maintained to this day an exclusive lesbian relati~nship.\"~~~ Two of the decisions go so far as to refer to the couples in terms of marriage: \"They (Braschi and Blanchard) regarded one another, and were regarded by friends and 120. But see Picon v. O.D.C. Assocs., No. 22894186 (Sup. Ct.

A widow(er) of a rent control tenant would not have to prove monogamy or intermingled finances to keep the apartment under rent control laws.129 Heterosexual fathers do not have to be \"discreet\"130 enough to survive the nexus test in order to gain custody. Thus, even for those queers who do seek marriage and family rights similar to heterosexuals,l31 Braschi and M.A.B. set up rules which require a far higher standard for lesbians and gays than exists for heterosexuals.132 b. Marriage The ever-lurking paradigm of marriage in these cases cannot be overlooked.133 Paula Ettelbrick writes: \"Steeped in a patriarchal system 127. 543 N.E.2d at 55. 128. 583 N.Y.S.2d at 999. 129.

This critique was posited by a letter writer to the New York Times shortly after the publication of the decision. 'This test, to which many lesbian, gay, and unmarried heterosexual relationships do not conform, is the weakness of the decision. The requirement that all unmarried couples meet the Braschi test, modeled after traditional marriage, will open the door for courts to challenge the validity of relationships case by case. By contrast, it confers benefits on married heterosexual couples, whether or not they would meet the test.\" Victoria C. Metaxas, N.Y. TnvIEs, Jul. 18,1989, at ,420. 133.

Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 111 1994 even the slightest expression of overt homosexual behavior would not be viewed favorably by the court.139 Susie Bright, a radical lesbian sex activist and writer,l40 would be unable to prove to the courts that her open lesbian sexuality has no \"adverse effect\" on her children. No family court in the face of a paternity claim would respect her lesbian motherhood. Sexual subversives would be excluded from access to the rights obtained in these cases. More important is that the liberation embodied in their sexual practices directly challenges the privilege accorded to the concept of \"family rights.\"I4l One commentator criticizes the Family Court's holding in Thomas S. v. Robin Y. as \"a decision that strikes a blow against alternative family structures. . . . Lesbians, and anyone in a non- traditional family should be wary of the subtext: lesbian parents have rights only to the extent that their relationship exactly duplicates the traditional heterosexual two-parent model-two kids, two parents, living together, one works, one stays home, private school, dog and all.\"142 Thus, queers are wary of the family's power to domesticate the marginal parts of their lives. Ruthann Robson theorizes this critique, \"klesbian resistance to the family should become more elemental: resistance to being either included or excluded, resistance to the power of the category of family within legal theory and legal practice to define, redefine, sanction, and appropriate lesbian existence.\"l43 Many queers practice promiscuity as sexual revolution, and for them the criteria of longevity, exclusivity, and marital reputation seem 139. While in M.A.B., the court enforces the secrecy of homosexuality, in Braschi, the court requires such openness, citing their families', superintendent's and doormen's knowledge of their relationship as evidence of their being a couple. While some closeted persons could not provide such proof, the New York County Civil Court found, in a rent-control tenancy inheritance case, that the couple's not being open with their families did not preclude inheritance.

While this dichotomy is obviously not quite absolute, the legal goals of sexual liberationists would look very different from those of Evan, Thomas S. and M.A.B. While BraschiBlanchard, R.B. and his lover, Young/Russo, and DianeNalerie should be permitted to form relationships as they wish, many queers do not wish to engage in such long-term relationships. Looking beyond heterosexual constructs, the law ~ could better respond to sexually subversive queer needs. The consideration of commitment and stability, necessary concepts for rent control and parenting, might, for example, include three-partner and other relationships. A new vision of parenting might also permit further recognition of queer farnilie~.l~ It also might ignore experimental sexualities, promiscuity, and other forms of sexual liberation when they have little bearing on a person's qualifications for parenting or tenancy inheritance. 4. Gender Subversives Subversive gender roles also seem excluded by the language of these cases. Fem queer boys, butch dykes, transvestites, drag queens, and transsexuals all subvert compulsory heterosexual roles.145 The few descriptions in these cases indicate that the parties perfam traditional gender roles. The application of the nexus test in both M.A.B. and Evan indicates that traditional gender performance is a requirement for a favorable decision. In M.A.B. v. R.B., the first characteristic the court used to weigh this test was the father's \"straight-acting7' behavior: \"The father's behavior has been discreet, not flamboyant.\"l46 To engage in the 144.

The positive reception of traditional gender performance by these courts indicates that nontraditional gender identities would fail the best interests and nexus tests. Regardless of access, many queers believe that gender performance should not be restricted by biology, and that such gender subversion is a necessary component of their queer identity.151 Thus, these cases, in failing to meet the needs or follow the goals of various queer communities, cannot be considered clear victories. The limitations of these victories parallel inequalities within the lesbian and gay community. Queer intersectionality and the queer continuum together as a framework might surpass these divisions which limit the revolutionary potential of queer identity.

The Braschi test, as well as the nexus test, empower only \"but- for\" queers with the ability to survive these tests. While the best interests test is more flexible in nature and application, it is nonetheless applied in a manner which precludes the success of many queer litigants. Even beyond the rules, the construction of lesbian and gay identity in these cases can inform the relationship of queer communities with the law. In this section, I will briefly explore the possible roles litigation may play in queer movements. As I have demonstrated in the above critique, litigation can be essentialize and marginalize queers. Based on this critique, I would like to situate litigation within political action. Because of the problems posed by litigation, and because most in our movements are not lawyers, litigation should not be the central focus for change. Rather a \"plurality of resistances\"l53 which encompasses three visions of the relation between queer communities and the law, would more accurately serve the queer continuum. Progressive movements have shown a tendency to rely on law reform and litigation generally as the principal vehicle for change.154 However, it is clear that pinning our hopes on litigation will not provide broad change on queer issues. Indeed, as these cases show, the danger in allowing litigation to defme our political goals is the further division of our community into \"but-for\" queers and intersectional queers. Queer intersectionality and the queer continuum call not for a unitary strategy centered on litigation but for a plurality of resistances: There is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the 153.

Instead there is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case; resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted rampant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise, interested or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist in the strategic field of power relations.155 Although litigation does not, as these cases demonstrate, mirror the breadth of queer communities, it is a tactic which may form part of the plurality of resistances. Other resistances include the mere commission of subversive acts that violate compulsory heterosexuality, such as public sex or multiple parenting. And, finally, the time-honored taking to the streets serves as a major form of resistance. Within the plurality of resistances there are three identifiable views of litigation's role in queer movements: continuing litigation strategies; working for the transformation of legal institutions, and looking for alternatives to litigation. These perspectives correspond to three theories of law: law as change, as subversion and as co-optation. A. Change The first perspective is that despite the exclusions in these cases, legal reform is a viable route for queer cornrnunities.156 This perspective sees working within the law as essential for progress. This liberal faith in the fairness of the law would seek to eradicate discrimination through applying the law in an objective, non-discriminatory fashion. Justice 155. FOUCAULT, supra note 16, at 95-96. Foucault's ground breaking work on sexuality and on social constructionism contributes immensely to theories of resistance. Bur cf:, RICHARD Mom, The Thing of It Is: Some Problems with Modek for the Social Construction of Homosexuality, in GAY IDEAS: OUTING AND OTHER CONIROVERSIES 221 (1992), in which Mohr, conflating various forms of critical theory, argues against notions of social construction of \"gay\" identity. Mohr further argues that without a liberal humanist notion of gay identity, there can be no concept of oppression, and thus no claim that rights have been violated. Id. at 4-5. Although I disagree with his exclusively liberal project, his exploration of liberalist philosophy and \"gay\" rights provides some clear arguments that I believe rhetorically useful. See RICHARD MOHR, GAYS/JUS~CE (1988). 156. But cf: BRUCE BAWER, A PLACE AT THE TABLE: THE GAY INDIVIDUAL IN AMEFUCAN SOCIEIY (1993) (arguing that lesbian and gay people should emphasize assimilationist aspects of the community to attain rights: \"Rather than concentrate on correcting the grotesque public image of gay life and on working to enable gays to live responsibly under the protection of the law, many radical gay activists perpetuate at every turn the widespread view of homosexuals as freaks, outlaws, sex addicts, and sexual exhibitionists.\") Id at 28-29. Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev. Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 116 1994 19941 QUEER IN'TERSEClTlONALJlY 117 Ellerin stated in The Matter of 27zomas S.: \"If  the child's best interests are to be the touchstone of the analysis, the attempts by the parties to argue the equities of their own respective personal positions are not germane.\"l57 Especially in family law situations, individuals will bring cases according to their personal needs, even when they conflict with political goals, rendering legal strategizing a far more complex endeavor.158 Yet the pursuit of political strategies could not deny individuals recourse to the law. Local family law cases might not attract the attention of the most talented lawyers in the cornmunity,l59 especially since all local decisions on family matters could hardly be monitored by national groups. As Thomas S. v. Robin Y. demonstrates, lesbian and gay litigation might be a difficult path toward reform, regardless of intersectionality. As I argued above, litigation as a route to change is flawed in that some queer communities will be have to wait until broader, protected categories subsume their own. The choice of continuing a litigation- based strategy may, however, even given this critique, be a cynical but necessary one. Perhaps all litigation strategies are conservative in this manner, and to use the law, we need to engage in some exclusion to accomplish the legitimization of our communities. To speed the legal legitimization of other queers through broader categories queer legal activists might attempt a successful application of these precedent-setting cases to different queer issues.160 Queer 157. Matter of Thomas S., N.Y.L.J., Nov. 21,1994, at B1, B2 (Ellerin, J., dissenting). 158. Interview with Susan P. Sturm, Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, March 4,1994. 159. The Sharon Bottoms case is a good example of a&s problems affecting the national movement Ms. Bottoms lost custody to her mother primarily based on her being a lesbian. The only point at which national counsel came into the case was after the trial judge's decision was rendered, leaving Ms. Bottoms a difficult appeal as her only recourse. See, e.g., B. Drummond Ayres, Jr., Gay Woman Loses Custody of Her Son to Her Mother, N.Y. m, Sept. 8, 1993, at A16. 160. See, e.g., Sturm, supra note 3 (\"Political conservatism does not fully account for the decline of the test case model of law reform [in corrections litigation]. To some extent, the decline in the model's significance is a natural development in the life cycle of social change and litigation.\"). Similarly, in lesbian and gay rights litigation, the movement now might be towatd establishing precedent, later to be extended, at which time the test case model would decline in importance. However, Braschrs precedential value is limited, as demonstrated by the New York Court of Appeals when it refused to apply Braschi to a visitation rights case in In the Matter of Allison D. v. Virginia M., 572 N.E.2d 27 (N.Y. 1991). See also Kevin Sack, Lesbian Loses a Ruling on Parent's Rights, N.Y. TIMES, May 3,1991, atB1. Paula Ettelbrick, who argued the case Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev. Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 117 1994 118 LAW & SEXUALITY [Vol. 4 communities with access to legal services could provide them for those who do not.161 Increased communication among queer legal groups and other queer groups might also contribute to effective reform. Another possibility for reform is through legislation. Although legislatures have been slow to approve lesbian and gay rights measures, political empowerment through voting might permit queer communities to achieve legislative change.162 Much contemporary debate concerns the balancing of demands for heterosexual privilege such as marriage with the feminist and sexual subversive ethics. Prioritization of marriage rights might be tactically wise and even necessary, but an informed choice requires overt awareness of the costs. Thus, while a strategy centered around litigation will invariably limit and exclude, it may be a necessary choice which can be adjusted to better meet the legal needs of all queer communities. B. Subversion The second perspective of the law centers on the potential for queers to subvert the legal institutions which exclude us through the law. The trajectory of such a transformation might be: exclusion > litigation > inclusion > transformation = subversion. By transforming legal institutions fiom inside them, queers might be able to subvert legal hierarchies. Nan Hunter puts forth this argument regarding marriage: \"What is most unsettling to the status quo about the legalization of lesbian and gay marriage is its potential to expose and denaturalize the historical construction of gender at the heart of marriage . . . p]he impact [of lesbian and gay marriage] will be to dismantle the legal structure of before the Court of Appeals, commented: \"It's a fairly major setback for the gay and lesbian rights movement because it says that society does not recognize our relationships.\" Id \"Ettelbrick . . . said lesbians placed particular significance on the decision because there are, by her organization's estimate, about 10,000 children in the United States being reared by lesbians who conceived through donor insemination.\" Id For more discussion of this case, see Leonard G. Florescue, A Trio of Children's Rights Cases, N.Y.L.J., June 5 ,  1991, at 3; Gary Spencer, Mother's Lesbian Parmer Denied Visitation Rights, N.Y.L.J., May 3,1991, at 1. 161. One example of such an effort is the LeGal clinic, sponsored by the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York, which provides free legal advice weekly at the Lesbian and Gay Community Center in New York. 162. I explore lesbian and gay voting rights in my forthcoming article, Geographically Sexual?: Representing Lesbian and Gay Interests Through Propomrtlonal Representation, in which I argue that the geographically based districting systems divide lesbian and gay communities that might, under a proportional system, comprise a formidable voting bloc in a proportional system. Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev. Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 118 1994 19941 QUEER INTERSECTIONXUY 119 gender in every maniage.\"l63 Thus, once accepted within a legal institution considered by many queers to be oppressive, we might transform the oppression out of the institution. One critique of this notion of change is that the process of gaining access to an institution such as maniage might require assimilationist rhetoric that would undermine our subversive potential once inside the institution.164 Thus, while transformation remains a potential strategy, it too may pose problems for the achievement of the goals of queer communities. C. Co-optation The third perspective is that a litigation-centered strategy forestalls the possibility of more radical change for queer communities. This notion of co-optation relies on a vision of law as inherently inegalitarian: \"CW]e must break free of the theoretical privilege of law and sovereignty, if we wish to analyze power within the concrete and historical framework of its operation. We must construct an analytics of power that no longer takes law as a model and a code.\"165 This vision led Critical Legal Studies (CLS)l66 theorists to criticize rights:l67 , mhe  American political system has enormous capacity to absorb and co-opt seemingly radical demands for change; to truncate the i-ange of political discourse to fit the boundaries of arguments for individualized, atomized entitlements, and ultimately, to legitimate hierarchies of 163. Hunter, supra note 133, at 18-19. 164. See generally, Polikoff, supra note 133. 165. Foucault, supra note 16, at 90. 166. For an excellent summary of the origins, accomplishments and failings of CLS, see Joan C. Williams, Critical Legal Studies: The Death of Transcendence and the Rise of the New Langdells, 62 N.Y.U. L. REV. 429. 167. For the definitive CLS critique of right., see Mark lhshnet, An Essay on Rights, 62 TEsAs L. REV. 1363 (1984). Notwithstanding the considerable contributions of CLS, their work is not unproblematic, especially from a minority perspective. Because this essay focuses on queer intersectional empowerment, I owe a great deal of my perspective on these issues to some Critical Race Theory scholars who have so effectively redirected critical energy toward minority perspectives. See eg., PATRICIA J.  WW, THE ALCHEMY OF RACE AND RIGHIS (1991); Mari J. Matsuda, Looking to the Bottom Critical Legal Studies and Reparations, 22 HARV. C.R.C.L. L. REV. 323 (1987) (arguing that CLS is an important intellectual development requiring the attention of people of color and that CLS can be enriched by incorporating the experience of \"the bottom\"); Patricia J. Williams, Alchemical Notes: Reconstructing Ideals from Deconstructed Rights, 22 HARV. C.RCL L. REV. 401 (1987) (discussing Black responses to the CLS rights critique). Heinonline - -  4 Law & Sexuality: Rev. Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 119 1994 power, which rights claims can amend but never overturn. '68 Indeed, these cases and their inherent limitations can be viewed as a co- opting of radical demands to prevent a broader subversion of the current heterosexist order. The court thus functions in Braschi not to create a first step to further rights, but to inoculate the system against the threat queer politics poses. Roland Barthes describes this in Mythologies: \"One immunizes the contents of the collective imagination by means of a small innoculation of acknowledged evil; one thus protects it against the risk of generalized subversion.\"l69 In granting limited rights to the acknowledged evil of \"but-for\" queer relationships, the courts in these cases protect the legal system against the broad fundamental change of queer politics. Recognizing the relationships of some queers, the law absorbs the threat of a queer revolution of human relationships. Litigation also prioritizes the conformist  pa^& of the queer continuum. Braschi might be easily said to function in this manner. Rent control statutes are an interesting site for the law, to first recognize lesbian and gay partnerships in a context where legislative intent required the implementation of a very strict test to prevent widespread abuse. The use of such a strict test to first recognize lesbian and gay couples indicates its conservative effect. Overtly, the court creates this strict test to prevent fraud by \"roommates\" but the strictness of the test enforces compulsory heterosexuality on couples. Frequent challenges to tenancy inheritance certainly influenced the Braschi court to limit sharply which individuals qualify as \"fa1nily.'~170 Although its recognition of lesbian and gay relationships is impressive, the criteria for a gay or lesbian couple are far more specific and numerous than for a heterosexual couple, who could marry. In this sense, the law, in recognizing but-for queer relationships, innoculates itself against the broader queer menace to compulsory heterosexuality. D. Transforming the Legal Landscape of Queer Lives To quote one gay legal activist: \"Does everyone who participates in an institution, whether it be the National Lesbian and Gay Task Force 168. Hunter, supra note 133, at 27. I would like to note that Professor Hunter here is describing CLS scholars, not her own work. 169. ROLAND BARTHES, MYTHOLOGIES 150 (Annette Lavers trans. 1972). 170.

Lesbian & Gay Legal Issues 120 1994 19941 QUEER R V T E R S E ~ O N ~  121 or the practice of law, become co-opted and incapable of proposing or achieving reform?\"71 In removing rights litigation from strategies for change, the co-optation perspective thus seems to promote a strictly dichotomized theory of resistance: Either there is change or there is not. But \"[ilt is not all or nothing.\"l72 Legal tactics, however, seen as part of a plurality of resistances, might begin to reflect the multiplicity of queer communities. Mari Matsuda discusses a similarly broad vision of change: An effort to create a united front can be built upon three considerations. First is the recognition that many approaches to a single problem may eventually get us where we want to go, and that stubborn rigidity in method will block coalition-building. Dr. King saw this when he said, \"Anyone who starts out with the conviction that the road to racial justice is only one lane wide will inevitably create a traffic jam and make the journey infinitely longer.\" Second, there is the more basic fact of our common goal: the transformation of an unjust into a just world. This transformative vision can bind us together even as our theoretical differences keep us apart. Third, the duality of liberal versus radical programs for change may be a false one. The liberal vision as developed from the bottom may in fact be one of radical social change.173 Although litigation may not be the principal focus of our efforts, contextually it might be useful in pursuing our political goals. Litigation cannot provide the complete expansion of rights some expect. But it can reform, empower, and raise'awareness. Queers can work for change and subversion while being aware of the danger of co-optation by the law. The desirability of multi-faceted discourse and tactics is one reason why it is fortunate that we have different people in different positions: street and . community activists, lobbyists, organizers, and academics . . . in 171.

The queer continuum, a re-conceptualization of Adrienne Rich\\u27s lesbian continuum, delineates the spectrum of queer identity. Part II will explore the facts, issues and holdings of these four cases. My examination of these cases will reveal how they grant some rights to “but-for” queers, who, “but-for” their being lesbian or gay, would be “perfect citizens.” I will discuss how the rules and applications of these cases either exclude some queer communities or address issues irrelevant to other communities. The communities whose interest I specifically address are poor queers, queers of color, sexual subversives, and gender subversive queers. These limitations should figure prominently in the consideration of litigation\\u27s role in queer activism. In Part III, I conclude by outlining the implications of this critique for the relationship between queer communities and litigation",
