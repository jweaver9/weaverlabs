The minority stress theory posits that sexual and gender minoritiesare at a particular risk for stress due to stigma and discrimination at the structural, interpersonal,and individual levels. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate andcompare the sexual satisfaction between lesbian (LW) and heterosexual (HSW) cisgender women.Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched the PubMed, Scopus,Science Direct, Websci, Proquest, and Wiley online databases from 1 January 2013 to 10 March 2023to identify the published observational studies on sexual satisfaction in women according to theirsexual orientation. The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the JBI critical appraisalchecklist for the analytical cross-sectional studies. Results: A total of 11 studies and 44,939 womenwere included. LW reported having orgasms during a sexual relationship more frequently thanHSW, OR = 1.98 (95% CI 1.73, 2.27). In the same direction, the frequency of women reporting “noor rarely” for having orgasms during their sexual relationships was significantly lower in the LWthan the HSW, OR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.45, 0.66). The percentage of the LW who reported having sexualintercourse at least once a week was significantly lower than that of the HSW, OR = 0.57 for LW(95% CI 0.49, 0.67). Conclusions: Our review showed that cisgender lesbian women reached or-gasm during sexual relations more often than cisgender heterosexual women. These findings haveimplications for gender and sexual minority health and healthcare optimization.Keywords: sexual and gender minority; sexual satisfaction; lesbian women; meta-analysis1. Background and RationalThe minority stress theory posits that sexual and gender minorities are at a particularrisk for stress due to stigma and discrimination at the structural, interpersonal, and indi-vidual levels [1]. This stress, in turn, elevates the risk of adverse health outcomes acrossseveral domains, including sexual satisfaction.Many studies have pointed out that sexual minorities experience significant healthdisparities [2–4]. These differences are associated with a model of intersectionality thatincludes social, biological, and economic components [5]. Despite this multidimensionality,the differences described focus primarily on mental health [6,7], sexually transmittedinfections and diseases, body image changes, and eating disorders [8,9]; however, sexualwell-being, despite its importance, is not usually taken into account in these analyses.Sexual satisfaction is a complex, multidimensional, and broad concept that includes in-dividual, relational, and contextual dimensions [10] and is conceptualized as a sexual rightby the World Health Organization [11] and the World Association for Sexual Health [12–14].According to Meston and Trapnell, 2005 [15], sexual satisfaction in women is described as amultifaceted construct that includes relational dimensions such as compatibility betweenHealthcare 2023, 11, 1680. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11121680 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcareHealthcare 2023, 11, 1680 2 of 13partners, communication patterns, and the absence of relational concerns, as well as in-dividual dimensions such as feelings of contentment and satisfaction with one’s sex life,and the absence of personal distress and concerns. Although sexual satisfaction is oftenperceived as the opposite of sexual distress, both constructs appear to have a more complexunderstanding, with sexual satisfaction being partially independent of sexual distress andbeing unable to be measured by an absence of sexual distress [16].According to Pascoal et al. [10], the heterosexual lay definitions of sexual satisfactioninclude two core dimensions related to sexual well-being at the personal level, and dyadicand relational processes. The individual component includes positive dimensions suchas reaching orgasm, experiencing sexual arousal, pleasure, and positive effect, while thedyadic component includes the frequency of sexual activity, intimacy, romantic feelings,and their expression. In contrast, the lay definition of sexual satisfaction among sexualminorities, which includes women in lesbian partnerships, involves these individual anddyadic components, as well as social discourses about sexual orientation [17]. The greatestsimilarity between the heterosexual and lesbian definitions of sexual satisfaction is positiveattitudes toward sexuality and pleasure, rather than a simple absence of sexual difficulties.Human sexuality is a natural and important part of peoples’ lives and well-being. Theunderlying interactions affecting sexual satisfaction are complex, and sexual orientationdifferences partly remain to be identified, as well as explained [18].Our aim with this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate and comparethe sexual satisfaction between lesbian (LW) and heterosexual (HSW) cisgender women.2. Methodology2.1. Study DesignThe PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [19] and recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook were followed [20]. Therewere no requirements for an ethical review of this work, because no human participantswere involved.2.2. Search StrategyWe searched the PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Websci, Proquest, and Wiley onlinedatabases from 1 January 2013 to 10 March 2023 to identify the published observationalstudies on sexual satisfaction in women according to their sexual orientation.The search strategy used in PubMed is described below. The strategy was modifiedaccordingly for its use in the other databases.((“homosexuality, female” [MeSH Terms] OR (“homosexuality” [All Fields] AND“female” [All Fields]) OR “female homosexuality” [All Fields] OR “lesbianism” [All Fields]OR “sexual and gender minorities” [MeSH Terms] OR (“sexual” [All Fields] AND “gender”[All Fields] AND “minorities” [All Fields]) OR “sexual and gender minorities” [All Fields]OR “lesbian” [All Fields] OR “lesbians” [All Fields] OR “lgbt*” [All Fields]) AND (“orgasm”[MeSH Terms] OR “orgasm” [All Fields] OR (‘sexual” [All Fields] AND “satisfaction”[All Fields]) OR “sexual satisfaction” [All Fields]) AND (“femal” [All Fields] OR “fe-male” [MeSH Terms] OR “female” [All Fields] OR “females” [All Fields] OR “females”[All Fields] OR “femals” [All Fields] OR (“womans” [All Fields] OR “women” [MeSHTerms] OR “women” [All Fields] OR “woman” [All Fields] OR “womens” [All Fields]OR “womens” [All Fields]) OR (“womans” [All Fields] OR “women” [MeSH Terms] OR“women” [All Fields] OR “woman” [All Fields] OR “womens” [All Fields] OR “womens”[All Fields]))) AND (y_10[Filter])There were no publication status and language restrictions on selecting the studies.2.3. Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaThe inclusion criteria were: 1. studies of a cross-sectional, observational type (in-cluding cross-sectional analyses of longitudinal studies); 2. participants: >18 years old;heterosexual and lesbian cisgender women; 3. comparison group/condition of interest:Healthcare 2023, 11, 1680 3 of 13sexual orientation (heterosexual versus lesbian); 4. primary outcome: sexual satisfaction–orgasm frequency; 5. secondary outcomes: the frequency of sexual intercourse and arousaldifficulties; and 6. settings: community. The exclusion criteria were: 1. studies exclusivelyfocused on transgender or nonbinary subjects; 2. global outcomes for lesbian and bisexualsubjects; and 3. experimental studies.2.4. Screening and Data ExtractionAn initial screening of the titles was conducted by (AM) based on the inclusion criteria.Duplicates and studies clearly not associated with the review objectives were excluded.Then, the abstracts were independently screed by two reviewers (AM and EC) based onthe above-established criteria. The relevant studies and those in which the abstract raiseddoubts had their full texts independently evaluated by the two reviewers.All disagreements were solved by consensus.The following data were then extracted from the included studies: the first author,publication year, country, study design, sample size, study population details, outcomes,results, and authors’ main conclusions.Sexual satisfaction was evaluated through various parameters, which included thefrequency with which the women reached orgasm in a sexual relationship, the degreeof difficulty in becoming aroused, pain during or after sex, a lack of interest in sex, thefrequency of sexual activity, and global sexual satisfaction.2.5. Risk of Bias AssessmentTwo reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in the selected studies usingthe JBI critical appraisal checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies [21]. This toolused eight criteria to evaluate the overall methodological quality of a study. The criteriaincluded: the sample inclusion criteria; a description of the subjects and settings; a valid andreliable measure of exposure; an objective and standard measure of condition; identifyingconfounding factors; strategies for dealing with confounding factors; a valid and reliablemeasure of outcome; and an appropriate statistical analysis. Disagreements were resolvedthrough discussion.2.6. Meta-AnalysisThe RevMan 5.4.1 (The Cochrane Collaboration) online software was used. Compa-rable data from studies with similar populations and outcomes were pooled using forestplots. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous data wasused as the effect measure. The statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies wasmeasured by using I2 in each analysis and a 5% significance level. The random effect modelwas selected for the analysis carried out, because the true effect sizes underlying all thestudies were stochastic.A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results byexcluding individual studies for each forest plot.3.

DiscussionOur data included eleven studies and a total of 2294 LW and 42,645 HSW. The resultswere relatively homogeneous and showed that the percentage of LW who reported to haveorgasms during all or most of their sexual relations was almost two times higher thanthat of HSW. The percentage reporting never or almost never reaching orgasm was higheramong HSW. At the same time, LW reported a lower frequency of sexual activity.In recent decades, the assessment of sexual satisfaction has gained importance andbeen included in health and well-being indicators. In 2002, the WHO [11], in collaborationwith the WAS, highlighted the importance of sexual health, including key factors such asinformation and sexual pleasure.Women’s sexuality, particularly heterosexual women’s sexuality, and predictors ofsexual satisfaction are well documented in the literature, with an emphasis on distinctivefeatures such as relational, psychological, and biological dimensions, above and beyondsexual function [32–34]. While sexual satisfaction is defined differently by many authors,there are also similarities among most studies. The evaluation of the frequency of orgasmis a relatively simple and transversal measure, although it depends on the self-evaluationand perception of each person.A discrepancy between sexual satisfaction levels and the frequency of sexual activitywas found [35], suggesting that women’s sexual satisfaction is multidetermined. Distinctivefactors were identified as promoters of sexual satisfaction, such as communication patterns,the quality of a relationship, and sexual compatibility, whereas other factors were describedas sexual satisfaction attenuators, such as sexual disorders and discrepancies in sexualdesire levels [36].A review published in 2021 [33] analyzed the predictors of sexual satisfaction inheterosexual women and included a total of 204 studies. Of the variables analyzed bythe authors, the following were highlighted as being correlated with women’s sexualsatisfaction: body image, mental health, physical health, orgasm frequency, relationshipsatisfaction, sexual communication, sexual desire, sexual frequency, sexual functioning,and sexual practices/variety. The authors of this review noted that the methods used toclassify sexual satisfaction were highly heterogeneous across the studies and that there werepossibly relevant variables that were only considered in a minority of studies, althoughHealthcare 2023, 11, 1680 10 of 13they seemed to correlate with female sexual satisfaction, such as: sexual openness or sexualthoughts/fantasies.Data on the predictors of LW’s sexual satisfaction have been overlooked, consideringthat most studies of women’s sexual satisfaction and its predictors have been conductedwith HSW, leading to a gap in the literature on understanding LW’s sexual satisfaction.A study about midlife women [37] revealed that their sexual satisfaction was partiallydetermined by sexual function and enhanced relational, psychological, and biologicaldimensions, such as relationship adjustment, psychological well-being, and menopausalsymptoms, but was not determined by sexual orientation [38].In another study [39] that evaluated HSW, LW, and bisexual women, an absence ofdepressive symptoms, satisfaction in an intimate relationship, better sexual functioninglevels, and perceived social support positively predicted sexual satisfaction. Among LW,experiencing internalized homonegativity was also a significant and negative predictor oftheir sexual satisfaction. A more recent study found evidence that internalized homonega-tivity does not contribute to lesbian women’s sexual satisfaction, whereas identity pridepositively contributes to lesbian women’s sexual satisfaction [40].The results of our review are in accordance with several studies that have indicatedthat LW tend to report higher levels of sexual functioning compared to HSW [41–43], andmore specifically, that LW report better orgasmic function.In a study on Dutch college women, LW were also much more likely to experienceorgasms during sexual activity with a female partner than HSW [44]. In this study, thelikelihood of orgasm was strongly related to receiving glans clitoral stimulation: lesbianwomen were less likely to receive vaginal stimulation during lovemaking than women inmixed-gender relationships, but those who did were significantly more likely to experienceorgasm from it [45].Possible justifications for the current findings may be related to the different sexualstimulation observed in LW and HSW and the possibility that LW engage in sexual activityand stimulation that facilitate reaching orgasm.One controversial question about LW’s sexual lives is whether they have sexualrelations less frequently than HSW [46]. In our review, the frequency of sexual intercourse,evaluated in four studies involving 5339 women, showed a statistically significant differencebetween lesbian and heterosexual women, with an odds ratio of 0.57 for LW, meaning thatthe percentage who reported to have sexual intercourse more than once a week was almosthalf of that for HSW.One of the problems related to the estimation of sexual satisfaction is that, often, thefrequency of sexual intercourse is only considered. Compared to HSW, LW were morelikely to usually receive oral sex, to use sex toys, to have sex for longer than 30 min, andengage in gentle kissing, having a broader set of behaviors included their definition ofhaving sex [47–50].This review has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. First, theremay be publications that were not indexed on the databases searched, and some relevantarticles may not have been found. Second, as previously mentioned, the definition of sexualactivity and satisfaction could be heterogeneous, as well as the study’s methodology.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, our review showed that LW achieved orgasm during a sexual interactionmore often than HSW. At the same time, LW reported less frequent sexual intercourse whencompared to HSW. The percentage of women reporting arousal difficulties did not differaccording to their sexual orientation.It is critical to understand that sexual satisfaction differs according to sexual orientationand to try to understand which factors are associated with a higher satisfaction, especiallyin minority groups that have been overlooked compared to cisgender, heterosexual people.These findings have implications for gender and sexual minority health andhealthcare optimization.Healthcare 2023, 11, 1680 11 of 13Author Contributions: A.M.: Conceptualization, methodology, data analysis, writing; E.C.: concep-tualization, data analysis, writing; M.P.: conceptualization, writing.

    "abstract": "Background: Sexual satisfaction is a complex, multifaceted, and broad concept that is influenced by several factors. The minority stress theory posits that sexual and gender minorities are at a particular risk for stress due to stigma and discrimination at the structural, interpersonal, and individual levels. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate and compare the sexual satisfaction between lesbian (LW) and heterosexual (HSW) cisgender women. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Websci, Proquest, and Wiley online databases from 1 January 2013 to 10 March 2023 to identify the published observational studies on sexual satisfaction in women according to their sexual orientation. The risk of bias in the selected studies was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal checklist for the analytical cross-sectional studies. Results: A total of 11 studies and 44,939 women were included. LW reported having orgasms during a sexual relationship more frequently than HSW, OR = 1.98 (95% CI 1.73, 2.27). In the same direction, the frequency of women reporting “no or rarely” for having orgasms during their sexual relationships was significantly lower in the LW than the HSW, OR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.45, 0.66). The percentage of the LW who reported having sexual intercourse at least once a week was significantly lower than that of the HSW, OR = 0.57 for LW (95% CI 0.49, 0.67). Conclusions: Our review showed that cisgender lesbian women reached orgasm during sexual relations more often than cisgender heterosexual women. These findings have implications for gender and sexual minority health and healthcare optimization.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio",
