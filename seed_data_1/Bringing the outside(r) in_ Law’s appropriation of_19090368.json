Drawing on workfrom geographical, feminist and critical race approaches to property, I put forward an understanding ofproperty as a relation of  belonging ‘held up’ by space. Building on this understanding, I argue that identitycan operate as property in the same way that land and material objects can, and that law appropriatessubversive identities by bringing them into its hegemonic space of  recognition and regulation. Law’s appropriations have a range of  effects on both the individual subjects directly involved in legalproceedings and the broader spaces in and through which those subjects forge their identities. Specifically thisarticle explores the appropriation of  gay and lesbian identities in the context of  immigration law, and ofaboriginal identities in the context of  Australia’s Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act2007 (Cth) (NTNERA).This article proposes that law appropriates subversive identities by bringing ‘outsiders’into hegemonic spaces of  belonging. It focuses on the appropriation of  lesbianidentities in the contexts of  British refugee law and on aboriginal identities in the contextof  Australia’s NTNERA respectively. The process of  appropriation involves subversiveidentities, which are defined in part through their positioning outside or on the margins oflaw, being brought into spaces of  legal recognition and regulation, with a wide range ofeffects. This article draws on geographical, feminist and critical race approaches to propertyto focus on the spatial effects of  such appropriations. The first part of  the article exploresthe conceptual links between property, identity and spatiality to put forward anunderstanding of  property as a spatially contingent relation of  belonging, and ofappropriation as a spatial process. The latter part of  the article builds on this understandingof  property and appropriation through empirical studies. Through these explorations of  theconceptual and the empirical, the article argues that law’s appropriations of  subversiveidentities reshape conceptual, social and physical spaces of  belonging. Because space isdynamic, this reshaping is not necessarily fixed or permanent; outsiders continue to buildand maintain their own spaces outside the law.1 Lecturer in Law.

All errorsare mine alone.Property, identity and belonging in spaceTo appropriate is to take someone else’s property and make it your own. Despite an extensivebody of  philosophical and legal literature on its meaning, property is still difficult to define.The adjectival meaning of  appropriate – ‘suitable or proper’ – is not an etymologicalcoincidence. As I have discussed elsewhere,2 the understanding of  property as a suitable orproper part or extension of  the subject has a long history in Western philosophy, mostprominently through the work of  John Locke and Georg Hegel. For Locke, property is aninherent, essential part of  the subject (the body’s labour) and a constructed extension of  it(the land upon which the body labours).3 For Hegel, subjectivity can only be achievedthrough the process of  appropriation; the subject must acquire property in the process ofbecoming fully human. Whereas Locke’s subject enters the world already possessing propertyin his own labour, Hegel’s subject must achieve property through his relations with theexternal world.4 Locke and Hegel have in common their definition of  property as somethingthat is an essential part or extension of  the proper subject (as well as an assumption thatneither women nor non-white races can be proper subjects).Debates over what counts as property continue to be prominent across a range ofpolitical contexts because property is still widely understood and enforced as a particularlyformidable right. Although many legal theorists have pointed out the social constructednessof  property5 – persuasively arguing that it comprises ‘no more than socially constitutedfact’6 – most nonetheless still understand property as operating to give the subjectsomething fixed, permanent and incapable of  being legally interfered with by others.Although Gray’s argument that property is ‘an illusion’ is an insightful and persuasive one,property is nonetheless an illusion with very material effects. Most significantly, propertygives the subject the power to exclude.7 Such exclusion has material effects ranging fromurban homelessness to indigenous dispossession. Citing these effects and discussing theultimate power of  forced eviction that private property rights entail, Nicholas Blomleyargues that property produces geographies of  violence.8 While Locke theorised property interms of  a person’s relationship with a thing (land), modern property theorists have madea point of  highlighting that ‘dominium [private power] over things is also imperium[political power] over our fellow human beings’.9 Property entails significant social power –it is not just an extension of  the subject, but also a relationship between subjects.Building on and taking further these understandings of  property as a socially powerfulright of  exclusion, Cheryl Harris, in her influential 1993 piece, argues that whiteness isproperty. Writing in the Unites States context but drawing on histories and argumentsapplicable to other Anglo-European states, Harris outlines how property rights are rootedin racial domination to the extent that whiteness is a form of  property.10 Slavery andNorthern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)3002 S Keenan, ‘Subversive Property: Reshaping Malleable Spaces of  Belonging’ (2010) 19 Social and Legal Studies423.3 M Cohen and C B Macpherson, ‘Property and Sovereignty’ in C B Macpherson (ed), Property: Mainstream andCritical Perspectives (University of  Toronto Press 1978).4 G W F Hegel, Elements of  the Philosophy of  Right (CUP 1991).5 K Gray, ‘Property in Thin Air’ (1991) 50 Cambridge Law Journal 252.6 K Gray, ‘The Legal Order of  the Queue’ (paper presented at Techniques of  Ownership: Artifacts,Inscriptions, Practices, London School of  Economics, 20 July 2007).7 J E Penner, The Idea of  Property in Law (Clarendon Press 1997); Cohen and Macpherson (n 3).8 N Blomley, ‘Law, Property, and the Geography of  Violence: The Frontier, the Survey and the Grid’ (2003) 93Annals of  the Association of  American Geographers 121.9 Cohen and Macpherson (n 3).10 C I Harris, ‘Whiteness as Property’ (1993) 106 Harvard Law Review 1707.colonial conquest – practices implemented by force and enshrined in law – establishedwhiteness as a prerequisite to the exercise of  enforceable property rights.11 (This is not tosay that all white people owned property, but that whiteness was one prerequisite to beingable to own property.) From the mid-1600s onwards, whiteness was established in the USas a protected legal category which gave white subjects a wide range of  social benefits, andfrom which non-white subjects were excluded. And, while slavery and conquest are nolonger legal practices,12 by essentially maintaining the status quo of  a socio-economicsystem entrenched in racial inequality, law continues to recognise the settled expectations ofwhite people that have been built on the benefits and privileges of  white supremacy.13Harris sees whiteness as a property right which is exercised whenever a white person takesadvantage of  the privileges accorded to white people simply by virtue of  their whiteness.14These privileges are vast and complex.15 Harris suggests affirmative action as a means toundermine the property interest in whiteness because this would aim to effectively diminishthe exclusiveness of  white privilege.16 According to this argument, property is both anessential part of  the subject (one’s race) and an important relationship between subjects(whiteness gives tangible privileges over non-whites).Other feminist legal theorists have also explored the idea that particular identitycharacteristics can function as property. Drawing on Harris’s work and on feministunderstandings of  the relational nature of  identity, Margaret Davies troubles the distinctionbetween ‘having’ and ‘being’ in regards to masculinity.17 Because having and being are soculturally interwoven, Davies argues, ‘any question of  “being” must bring with it – at somelevel – a question of  “having”’.18 Failure to notice the interdependence of  these ideas, sheargues, may ‘lead to the re-stereotyping or re-freezing of  the identities which are otherwisesubject to transgression’.19 Making the case for a queer theory of  property, Davies isarguing for a conceptual linkage between identity (often understood as fixed and essential)and ownership (often understood as transferable and impermanent). Such linkage mightallow for a de-essentialised understanding of  both property and identity, and thus for asubversion of  the rigid ‘sameness and otherness’ which essentialised understandingsengender. As will be discussed further below, Davina Cooper has questioned the distinctionbetween ownership and membership in her work on property.What these feminist and critical race scholars have in common is their argument that, aswell as offering increased access to property, belonging to particular social groups can alsoitself  constitute property. This argument is in many ways consistent with the Lockean andHegelian understanding of  property as an essential part of  the proper subject. But whereasthese classical philosophical formulations begin with an assumed separation between thesubject and that outside it and understand property as a relation between them, the criticaltheorists discussed above challenge (either implicitly or explicitly) that assumed separation.Bringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities11 Harris (n 10) 1718–24.12 That is, slavery and conquest are no longer legal in their traditional forms. Many would argue that conquestcontinues in other forms today, particularly in ‘postcolonial’ settler states, and that certain contemporaryracialised labour practices amount to slavery.13 Harris (n 10) 1731.14 Ibid 1734.15 P McIntosh, White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack (Wellesly College Working Paper No 189 1989).16 Harris (n 10) 1785.17 M Davies, ‘Queer Property, Queer Persons: Self-Ownership and Beyond’ (1998) 8 Social and Legal Studies327.18 Ibid 343.19 Ibid.301If  having is inextricably linked to being, if  whiteness and other identity characteristics areproperty, then the subject is always already connected to that which is outside it. Theseunderstandings of  property thus require a shift in focus away from the subject and onto thebroader spaces, relations and networks that constitute property. This shift in focus does notimply that the subject becomes irrelevant or disappears from view, but rather that itbecomes part of  a fuller picture of  factors to be considered.One such factor is belonging, which is in many ways the inverse of  exclusion – thesubject can exclude the world from her object because that object belongs to her. As wellas property ownership, belonging can signify membership of  a community, a relationship toplace, and/or a behaviour or identity that ‘fits’, or is ‘at home’.20 Nira Yuval-Davis describesbelonging as being about emotional attachment, about feeling safe and/or ‘at home’.21Emily Grabham writes that belonging ‘refers to the location of  an object or person in its“proper place” (“the book belongs on the shelf  over there” or “you belong in the UK”)’.22Belonging thus connotes a sense of  propriety, of  the proper. To belong is to fit smoothly,or without trouble, into either a conceptual category or a material position. It is necessarilya relational term; an object/subject/practice/part that belongs cannot exist in a vacuum, itmust belong to or with something else.Cooper used belonging as a way to understand the overlap between property asownership and property as membership in her study of  property practices at SummerhillSchool, an alternative school where children choose whether or not to attend class andwhere rule-making and dispute resolution involve the school body as a whole (both teachersand children).23 Cooper found that property practices at Summerhill were constituted by alegally pluralist regime of  institutional recognition,24 with understandings andperformances of  property being shaped by official state practices, a range of  formal andinformal school acts. Cooper describes property practices at Summerhill as involving anumber of  intersecting dimensions, of  which belonging is the most important.25 Cooperconsiders belonging in two ways: firstly, the relationship whereby an object, space, or rightsover it belong to a subject (‘subject–object’); and, secondly, the constitutive relationship ofpart to whole whereby attributes, qualities or characteristics belong to a thing or a subject(‘part–whole’).26 Both types of  belonging implicate social relations and networks thatextend beyond the immediate subject and object of  property; property is insteadunderstood as ‘a set of  networked relations in which the subject is embedded’.27‘Holding-up’ and different kinds of propertyCooper’s analysis of  property is spatial in that it focuses on the networks in which thesubject is embedded rather than primarily on the subject herself. Networks are necessarilyspatial; as particular arrangements of  intersecting forces or things that necessarily extendbeyond the subject, different networks (whether they be social, conceptual or physical)Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)20 D Cooper, Governing Out of  Order: Space, Law and the Politics of  Belonging (Rivers Oram Press 1998).21 N Yuval-Davis, K Kannabiran and U M Vieten ‘Introduction’ in N Yuval-Davis, K Kannabiran and U M Vieten (eds), The Situated Politics of  Belonging (Sage Publications 2006).22 E Grabham, ‘“Flagging” the Skin: Corporeal Nationalism and the Properties of  Belonging’ (2009) 15 Bodyand Society 63.23 D Cooper, ‘Opening up Ownership: Community Belonging, Belongings, and the Productive Life of  Property’(2007) 32 Law and Social Inquiry 625.24 Ibid.25 Ibid 628.26 Ibid 629.27 Ibid 636.302constitute the reference systems through which we locate ourselves in the world.Geographer Doreen Massey argues that instead of  thinking of  places as areas withboundaries around, it is more useful and accurate to imagine them as articulated momentsin networks of  social relations and understandings28 (my emphasis). In order to constituteproperty, I have argued elsewhere that the set of  networked relations to which Cooperrefers must not only include one of  belonging between either subject and object or part andwhole, but also be structured in such a way that that relation of  belonging is conceptually,socially and physically supported or ‘held up’.29 That is, the set of  networked relations thatCooper describes must form a space that holds up the relation of  belonging.As has been argued by Massey and other geographers, all spaces are produced by amultiplicity of  different, dynamic forces – space is physical, social, conceptual and,importantly, active. Put simply, relations of  belonging are held up when the wider socialprocesses, structures and networks that constitute space give force to those relations. By thisI mean that they are recognised, accepted and supported in ways that have a range of  effectsand consequences. For example, heterosexual relations tend to be held up by space in amultitude of  ways that homosexual relations are not (through institutional means such asmarriage and parenting rights, through social validation such as accepting, supporting andcelebrating couples who hold hands or kiss in public, through positive media representation,through the availability of  appropriate sex education and safe sex materials, etc.). Thisholding up by space of  a relation of  belonging is more than the act of  state recognition,which is associated with liberal identity politics, and which has been specifically critiqued forits predetermination of  the bounds of  the propertied subject, particularly in colonialcontexts.30 While recognition, as Brenna Bhandar argues, ‘fails to escape the violenceinherent in colonial spatial and temporal orders’,31 the concept of  holding-up is directlyconcerned with these orders.The understanding of  belonging as between part and whole (the second in whichCooper considers belonging) is something of  a departure from traditional and legalunderstandings of  property, but resonates strongly with Harris’s analysis of  whiteness asproperty. Using the analysis of  part–whole belonging, whiteness can be understood asproperty because the property holder is embedded in certain social relations and networksof  belonging. A white person can enjoy the privileges of  whiteness because he or shebelongs to the various social relations and networks that constitute whiteness. Associologists such as Ruth Frankenberg have shown, those relations and networks arecomplex and far-reaching. Whiteness, like all identity categories, is socially constructedthrough historically specific fusions of  political, economic and other forces.32 Whiteness inturn ‘constructs daily practices and worldviews in complex relations with material life’.33That is, whiteness is productive of  subjectivities. So while whiteness can be understood asbelonging to the white subject as Harris argues (whiteness as property in the sense ofsubject–object belonging), the white subject also belongs to the complex relations andnetworks that form whiteness (whiteness as property in the sense of  part–whole belonging).This analysis suggests that, in order to understand the varied social powers of  property,Bringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities 30328 D Massey ‘Power-geometry and a Progressive Sense of  Place’ in B Curtis, T Putnam, G Robertson, L Ticknerand J Bird (eds), Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change (Routledge 1993).29 Keenan (n 2).30 B Bhandar, ‘Plasticity and Post-Colonial Recognition: “Owning, Knowing and Being”’ (2011) 22 Law andCritique 227.31 Ibid 228.32 R Frankenberg, The Social Construction of  Whiteness: White Women, Race Matters (Routledge 1993).33 Ibid.both subject–object and part–whole belonging must be considered. In policy terms, thisanalysis means that, if  the normative goal is to challenge the way whiteness (or anotheridentity category) operates as a structure of  exploitation and oppression, then it is therelations and networks that form whiteness which must be changed rather than theindividual subjects who belong to those relations and networks.Law’s appropriations of subversive identitiesWhat does this understanding of  property mean for law? On one level, understandingproperty as a relationship of  belonging held up by space demonstrates that property is notdefined by law alone. Cooper’s study showed that property at Summerhill was constitutedthrough a range of  social norms, rules and relations rather than through law alone. Onanother level, understanding property as a relationship of  belonging held up by space alsoreveals the spatiality of  the state co-optation of  identity politics, which I will argue belowcan be usefully understood as law’s appropriations of  subversive identities. Both insightsoffer a way of  understanding the political effects of  law that is different from the insightsof  socio-legal work that takes individual legal subjects – or the similarly grouped subjectsof  liberal identity politics – as the focus of  its analysis. Widening the lens of  analysis outfrom the subject and onto the spaces of  belonging in which the subject exists (and, as willbe argued below, through which the subject is constituted) brings into view physical, socialand conceptual effects of  law that tend to be overlooked in socio-legal approaches and inother analyses that focus on the subject (or on groups of  subjects). Bringing thisunderstanding of  property to law shows how politics of  co-optation are not just about theco-optation of  individual subjects or groups, but also about shifting the space in whichthose subjects or groups were able to emerge as a potentially subversive force.There is now an expansive critical literature on the ways in which the state and otherinstitutions have co-opted different kinds of  identity politics. Identity politics is a broadterm that encompasses a range of  causes based on the shared experiences of  injustice ofmembers of  particular social groups.34 Identity politics were essential to the civil rightsmovement in the United States, to the attainment of  equal legal rights for women, and tomany other hugely significant social changes over the past century. In recent decades,however, there has been increasing criticism of  identity politics and a decided theoreticalshift away from them.35 One of  the main critiques is that identity categories, such as‘woman’, ‘black’ and ‘gay’, are social constructs that do not have natural or universalmeanings. To take the first example, Simone de Beauvoir’s now classic assertion that ‘one isnot born, but rather becomes, a woman’36 has been definitively confirmed by successivegenerations of  feminist writers who have debunked ideas that women can be definedthrough their genitalia, appearance or sexual preference, and explored the multiple ways inwhich women (and men) learn to perform their genders.37 It is thus unclear who is insideand outside any particular category, and those who do fall inside the categories will notnecessarily have a strong base of  shared experience.38 There has also been critique of  thescale of  change that identity politics is capable of  producing. The elements of  identitypolitics that have gained most traction in mainstream political praxis are liberal campaignsNorthern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)30434 C Heyes ‘Identity Politics’ in Edward N Zalta (ed), Stanford Encyclopedia of  Philosophy (Plato 2009).35 M Lloyd, Beyond Identity Politics: Feminism, Power and Politics (Sage Publications 2005); J Anner, Beyond IdentityPolitics: Emerging Social Justice Movements in Communities of  Color (South End Press 1996).36 S de Beauvoir, The Second Sex (Alfred A Knopf  2010) 267.37 See, for example, J Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of  Identity (Routledge 1990); B Hooks, Ain’tI a Woman? Black Women and Feminism (Pluto Press 1990).38 E Kosofsky Sedgwick, Epistemology of  the Closet (University of  California Press 1990); Butler (n 37); Hooks(n 37).that have as their goal the improvement of  conditions and the extension of  rights for thatparticular identity category, rather than the broader goal of  shifting the very systems thatproduce identity categories and their differential conditions. As Wendy Brown argues:politicised identities generated out of  liberal, disciplinary societies, insofar as theyare premised on exclusion from a universal ideal, require that ideal as well as theirexclusion from it, for their own perpetuity as identities.39That is, liberal identity politics aims at inclusion within a system rather than at systemic change.Related to, and in some cases as part of  this critique of  identity politics, is a specificcritique of  law’s co-optation of  such politics. There have, for example, been critiques ofrace politics in the US in the post-civil-rights era, pointing to the de-radicalisation of  theBlack movement and arguing that the achievement of  formal legal equality gives the illusionof  substantive equality. The reality of  substantive inequality along the lines of  race persistsand is covered up and thus to an extent protected by law.40 The recognition of  indigenousland rights in the courts of  settler colonial states such as Australia and Canada has also beencritiqued for its ultimate re-inscription of  colonial power over indigenous difference andresistance.41 The passage of  hate crime laws to ‘protect’ women, sexual and racial minoritieshas come under considerable critique for its reliance on and bolstering of  the deeply racistand sexist prison industrial complex.42 And even relatively conservative feminist voices havepointed out that ‘gender mainstreaming’ in international law has allowed claims to equalityto be tamed and de-radicalised.43 By including and ostensibly protecting particulararticulated interests of  a range of  marginalised identity groups, law improves the situationsof  only the most privileged of  such groups while ignoring the most oppressed andpreserving the overarching systems that produce such oppression and marginalisation.Thinking spatially: co-optation as appropriationFrom a spatial perspective, law’s co-optation of  identity politics can be understood asoccurring in part due to an implicit construction of  space as static, closed and singular. Thisimplicit understanding is prevalent in Western philosophy44 and is shared by law and by theelements of  identity politics that come to be co-opted. Legal geographers have consistentlycritiqued law for its assumption that space is the static, neutral backdrop to legal action.45Similarly, liberal identity politics (which tend to be the elements of  identity politics that areco-opted by law) have been critiqued for being ‘single axis’,46 disconnected from grassrootsstruggles and lacking in genuine intersectionality (that is, lacking in an understanding of  theBringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities39 W Brown, ‘Wounded Attachments’ (1993) 21 Political Theory 390.40 R C Smith, We Have No Leaders: African Americans in the Post-civil Rights Era (State University of  New York Press1996).41 I Watson, ‘Buried Alive’ (2002) 13 Law and Critique 253; S Motha, ‘Mabo: Encountering the Epistemic Limitof  the Recognition of  Difference’ (1998) 7 Griffith Law Review 79; F L Korsmo, ‘Claiming Memory in BritishColumbia: Aboriginal Rights and the State’ (1996) 20 American Indian Culture and Research Journal 71.42 D Spade, Normal Life: Administrative Violence, Critical Trans Politics, and the Limits of  Law (South End Press 2011);A Smith, ‘Unmasking the State: Racial/Gender Terror and Hate Crimes’ (2007) 26 Australian Feminist LawJournal 47–57.43 H Charlesworth, ‘Not Waving but Drowning: Gender Mainstreaming and Human Rights in the UnitedNations’ (2005) 18 Harvard Human Rights Journal 1.44 D Massey, For Space (Sage Publications 2006).45 N K Blomley and J C Bakan, ‘Spacing Out: Towards a Critical Geography of  Law’ (1992) 30 Osgoode HallLaw Journal 661.46 K Crenshaw, ‘Demarginalizing the Intersection of  Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique ofAntidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics’ (1989) University of  Chicago LegalForum 139.305complex ways in which different systems of  oppression, such as class, race and gender,intersect to form the conditions of  people’s lives).47One effect of  this construction of  space as static, closed and singular is that time isenvisaged as an interconnected, homogeneous configuration of  movement from onemoment to the next – time as a singular universal trajectory of  becoming, which operatesover smooth, static, ideologically closed space.48 These understandings of  time and spacein turn support a view of  history and ‘development’ as an inevitable march towards acommon goal. As Massey puts it, ‘coexisting heterogeneity is rendered as (reduced to)place in the historical queue’, and difference is neatly packed into bounded spaces anddismissed to the past, which is implicitly understood as singular – as our past.49 Thusmigrants from ‘developing’ countries are seen as arriving not only from the peripheries, butalso from the past.50 This understanding of  space and time similarly supports anunderstanding of  development and globalisation as an inevitable temporal sequence –poor nation states and those in early stages of  capitalism are understood as ‘catching up’rather than as being involved in current practices and relations of  increasing inequality andoppression.51 Single-axis identity politics also tend to construct identity groups as needingto catch up with the majority, that is, to be included in a political and legal space that is‘advanced’ and ‘modern’.52Relegating spatial difference to temporal sequence means constructing as inevitableboth the present and the future for those who are ‘behind’ in the queue, because thesingular, linear temporal trajectory is already determined. Similarly, relegating identitydifference to a need for inclusion into a pre-existing political space means constructing asinevitable the dominance of  that pre-existing space. Understanding space as active andmultiplicitous rather than static and singular enables an analysis of  law’s co-optation ofsubversive identities that escapes the inevitability of  the dominance of  law’s space. Such co-optations are not just about bringing individual subjects or groups inside a dominant space,but also about shifting the space in which such individuals and groups are embedded. Theseco-optations are thus not just a matter of  bringing outsiders in, but about reshaping andreducing the outside. Such reshaping and reduction affects what relations of  belonging will beheld up in the future. These processes are not simply co-optations of  groups and individualsbut appropriations of  subversive identities and corresponding reshapings of  the spaces thatonce held them up. Yet, because space is active and multiplicitous, such appropriations arenever fixed or complete; reshaping is an ongoing process, as is resistance to law’sappropriations.

The Convention Relating to the Statusof  Refugees 195154 was drawn up in the post-Second World War era as part of  a suite ofnew international legal instruments based on liberal notions of  human rights and equality.55State signatories to the Convention are obliged to provide protection for individual subjectswho have successfully fled their home state and are unable or unwilling to return due to a‘well-founded fear of  being persecuted for reasons of  race, religion, nationality,membership of  a particular social group or political opinion’ (Article 1 as amended by the1967 Protocol). It is now an accepted tenet of  refugee law in particular states includingAustralia, Britain and Canada that sexual orientation and gender identity can constitute a‘particular social group’ within the meaning of  the Convention56 and that, accordingly,individuals who leave their home countries because they have a well-founded fear ofsexuality-based persecution should not be forced to return there.57While there has been research published on the legal position of  queer asylum seekersand the particular difficulties they face in the refugee determination process,58 and on theBringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities53 B Keenan, ‘Milestone Victory for Gay Refugees’ The Guardian (London, 7 July 2010)<www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/jul/07/supreme-court-gay-refugees-right-to-asylum> accessed 5 December 2011; N Miles, No Going Back: Lesbian and Gay People and the Asylum System(Stonewall 2010).54 189 UNTS 150 (entered into force 22 April 1954).55 J Fitzpatrick, ‘Revitalizing the Refugee Convention’ (1996) 9 Harvard Human Rights Journal 229, 231.56 Article 1A (2) of  the Convention defines a refugee as any person who ‘owing to well-founded fear of  beingpersecuted for reasons of  race, religion, nationality, membership of  a particular social group or politicalopinion, is outside the country of  his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to availhimself  of  the protection of  that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country ofhis former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it’; Article 33(1) states:‘No contracting state shall expel or return (refouler) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers ofterritories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of  his race, religion, nationality,membership of  a particular social group or political opinion.’57 In the Australian context this was first judicially confirmed in Applicant A v MIEA (1997) 190 CLR 225; in theCanadian context in Ward v Attorney-General (Canada) (1993) 2 SCR 689; in the United Kingdom in Islam vSecretary of  State for the Home Department Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex p Shah, R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal,ex p Shah [1999] UKHL 20, [1999] 2 AC 629; and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees hashad the policy that ‘persons facing attack, inhumane treatment, or serious discrimination because of  theirhomosexuality, and whose governments are unable or unwilling to protect them, should be recognised asrefugees’ since 1996: see K L Walker, ‘Sexuality and Refugee Status in Australia’ (2000) 12(2) InternationalJournal of  Refugee Law 175.58 For example, Walker (n 57); C F Stychin, ‘“A Stranger to its Laws”: Sovereign Bodies, Global Sexualities, andTransnational Citizens’ (2000) 27(4) Journal of  Law and Society 601; D McGhee, ‘Accessing Homosexuality:Truth, Evidence and the Legal Practices for Determining Refugee Status – The Case of  Ioan Vraciu’ (2000)6(1) Body and Society 29; J Millbank, ‘Gender, Visibility and Public Space in Refugee Claims on the Basis ofSexual Orientation’ (2002–2003) 1(3) Seattle Journal of  Social Justice 725; J Millbank, ‘A Preoccupation withPerversion: The British Response to Refugee Claims on the Basis of  Sexual Orientation, 1989–2003’ (2005)14(1) Social and Legal Studies 115.307problems facing women claiming refugee status,59 this research has remained largely withinthe framework of  single-axis identity and recognition rather than positing a broader critiqueof  the system itself. Despite the abolition of  the discretion requirement, refugee lawcontinues to require the performance of  a very particular sexuality for asylum to be granted.As will be discussed in this section, that sexuality is overwhelmingly based on Westerncommercial understandings of  gay men. Building on the conceptual discussion above, thissection shows how refugee law can be understood as appropriating the potentiallysubversive property of  the queer woman asylum seeker. The asylum seeker’s property in thiscontext is her identity, her part–whole belonging. She is persecuted in her home statebecause of  her queer sexuality and non-normative gender performance. In travelling to thereceiving state, she has the potential to produce subversive property there – by asserting thather queer sexuality and non-normative gender performance should be held up in thereceiving state. However, the asylum seeker must perform her identity in a very particularway. The same properties that made her subversive, disruptive, even inflammatory in herhome state must be shown to be properties that make her a worthy citizen in the receivingstate. In demanding proof  of  a particular lesbian identity legible to a Western court, thereceiving state requires the asylum seeker to shift the way she performs her identity, whilepositioning itself  as a haven of  salvation and generosity. Many refugee lobby groups alsoadopt these saviour discourses, bolstering neocolonial ideas about sending and receivingstates.60 Through this legal process the receiving state appropriates the asylum seeker’spotentially subversive property and uses it as means by which to further develop its ownspace of  belonging.For an applicant to prove her sexuality, she must give details such as when she firstthought she was a lesbian, all of  the intimate relationships and feelings she has had with andfor other women, how she managed to hide those feelings and relationships and whathappened to her as a consequence if  she did not manage to do so, along with anything elsethat the decision maker hearing the case thinks is relevant to authenticating her lesbianidentity. Although queer asylum seekers still assert agency in the courtroom, acting tacticallyin the face of  overwhelming legal formulism,61 refugee law ultimately requires ‘real lesbians’to either be participants in the pink economy and publicly perform their sexuality like gaymen, or alternatively to be caring maternal women whose sexuality is an almost invisiblepart of  their identity.62 For example, a Mongolian woman seeking asylum in Australia onthe basis of  sexuality persecution was asked by the Refugee Review Tribunal to gives namesand addresses of  ‘gay locations’ in both Mongolia and Australia, and to disclose whethershe had yet acquired a local woman lover in Sydney.63 The tribunal then asserted thatconditions for gays and lesbians in Mongolia had been improving in recent years, citing asauthority the Spartacus Guide, a commercial travel guide aimed at Western gay menNorthern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)59 For example, J Greatbatch, ‘The Gender Difference: Feminist Critiques of  Refugee Discourse’ (1989) 1(4)International Journal of  Refugee Law 518; A B Johnsson, ‘The International Protection of  Women Refugees:A Summary of  Principal Problems and Issues’ (1989) 1(2) International Journal of  Refugee Law 221.60 P Tatchell, ‘Gay Asylum Reform Proposals’ (Gays Without Borders 2008) <http://gayswithoutborders.wordpress.com/peter-tatchell-gay-asylum-reform-proposals/> accessed 20 September 2011; ‘Prossy KakoozaMust Stay!’ (Facebook) <www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=15442634010> accessed 10 September 2011.61 T A M Johnson, ‘On Silence, Sexuality and Skeletons: Reconceptualizing Narrative in Asylum Hearings’ (2011)20 Social and Legal Studies 57.62 S Keenan, ‘Safe Spaces for Dykes in Danger?

In a Canadian case, a Russian woman seeking asylum tried to usereceipts from the Toronto gay village to prove her lesbian sexuality.64 The Immigration andRefugee Board took issue with the fact that only some of  the receipts were for transactionspaid by debit and or credit card, and that only some ‘had an air-miles card number on them’.The board found that her inability to show with certainty that the payments were madedirectly by her meant that she did not make any of  the payments herself, and that, ‘on abalance of  probabilities’, she was not really a lesbian.These cases demonstrate that women claiming asylum on the basis of  sexualitypersecution must prove that they fit into a particular Western lesbian identity category thatis constructed as universal. In terms of  part–whole belonging, refugee law produces alesbianism ‘whole’ of  which applicants must prove they are a part. In so doing it also(re)produces a space of  belonging that holds up one particular way of  being a queer woman.Apart from the obvious problems with assuming that asylum seekers will be financially ableto make ‘gay purchases’, practically able to name ‘gay locations’, and culturally able to makesocial connections as soon as they arrive, the requirement that these women perform theirsexuality in this commercial, public way also ignores the reality that the asylum-seekingsubject has by definition come from a space where her queer sexuality was not held up,indeed, where it was unsafe for her to publicly show her sexuality. Refugee law’s requirementof  the performance of  this particular lesbian sexuality not only accounts, to some extent, forthe relative invisibility of  women (compared to men) making claims for asylum on the basisof  sexuality,65 but also dictates and thereby reproduces a mode of  being lesbian that fits withstate interests in consumerist economics and easily definable and visible minoritycommunities. Overt queer sexuality, the very aspect of  identity that made the subjectsubversive and put her at risk in her home state, is made into a normative property definedby courts using commercial, masculine standards. Such cases also demonstrate the overlapbetween property as part–whole and subject–object belonging, for, to have her (part–whole)lesbian identity held up, the applicant must own particular objects and move in or ‘master’social and physical space in a particular way (subject–object belonging). In requiring theasylum seeker to behave and consume in particular ways, refugee law shifts the asylumseeker’s queer sexuality from being a property that unsettled and was potentially subversiveof  the (sending) state to one that bolsters the broad agenda of  the (receiving) state.By requiring queer women asylum seekers to perform this particular version of  lesbianidentity, refugee law takes what was the subversive property of  the asylum seeker andreorients it such that it becomes part of  the property of  the receiving state. While theasylum seeker’s sexuality unsettled the space from which she came – unsettled that space tothe point where she could not safely remain there – refugee law requires her to perform hersexuality in a way that reinforces the hegemonic space of  belonging of  the receiving state.While this performance fits with and strengthens the growing space of  ‘homonationalist’belonging,66 the asylum seeker can be left isolated within refugee communities.67 The spaceof  belonging produced by court decisions on asylum claims made by women on the basisof  sexuality persecution is one in which the nation state is solidly shaped with clearlydelineated physical boundaries. Refugee law proceeds on the basis that a subject eitherbelongs or does not, and that belonging is determined by law alone. Indeed, the lesbianBringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities64 X(Re) (25 March 2008).65 This has been noted elsewhere: J Millbank, ‘Gender, Sex and Visibility in Refugee Claims on the Basis ofSexual Orientation’ (2003) 18 Georgetown Immigration Law Journal 66 J K Puar, Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times (Duke University Press 2007).67 A de Jong, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Refugees and Asylum Seekers (The Information Centreabout Asylum and Refugees in the UK September 2003).309subject produced by refugee law functions in a similar way to the figure of  the woman insome human rights discourses, as has been critiqued by Inderpal Grewal and others68 – asobjects of  charity capable of  being saved from their own state’s repressive regimes andconverted to sexual citizenship, which can be done through consumerism. Refugee lawappropriates the subversive property of  the lesbian asylum seeker and produces a space thatholds up particular racialised, gendered and sexualised identities.One circumstance that is never taken into consideration by receiving courts andtribunals is the effect that their decision about the particular applicant before them will haveon the space she leaves behind. Of  course, the very structure of  refugee law prevents thistype of  consideration from being taken into account – the Refugee Convention isconcerned with individual ‘human beings’ enjoying ‘fundamental rights and freedoms’, andwith ‘the problem of  refugees’ not becoming ‘a cause of  tension between states’.69 It is notconcerned with the complex forces and power structures that have caused the sending stateto be a dangerous place for queer women, or with the future of  those ‘outside’ spaces. Yet,the operation of  refugee law has broad spatial effects – by enabling the permanentdeparture of  dissident queer subjects on the condition that those subjects present theirhome states as uniformly and impossibly homophobic, refugee law leaves undisturbed andeven bolstered, the gendered and heteronormative networks of  belonging that make thatspace unlivable for queer women. The important work of  local groups’ resistance tohomophobia and sexism must necessarily be deemed inadequate by the courts of  thereceiving state in order to construct the sending state as a uniformly and impossiblyunlivable space for queer women. Yet, in reality, such groups continue to work to producespaces that do hold up queer relations of  belonging, with such spaces often beingstrategically out of  the view and reach of  law, and outside the understanding of  Western‘experts’.70 Although a positive refugee decision makes a significant and welcome differencein the lives of  the individual applicant, it leaves unquestioned the spaces of  belonging thatcause queer women to move in the first place. Refugee law appropriates the subversiveproperty of  the lesbian asylum seeker and produces spaces that hold up particular racialised,gendered and sexualised identities.Property law’s appropriation of ‘the subversive aboriginal person’Moving now from a socio-legal area generally framed in terms of  international migrationand mobility to one generally framed in terms of  domestic relations and stasis, this sectionexamines law’s appropriation of  subversive identities in the context of  indigenous landrights. It is already fairly well established that the law of  settler colonial states facilitateslegitimises and relies upon the appropriation of  indigenous land and mineral resources.71Patrick Wolfe and others argue that settler colonialism has as its goal the elimination of  thenative, and this argument certainly holds weight when considered in light of  the ongoingpolicies of  punishment, control and removal of  indigenous people that are prevalent insettler colonial states.72 With the advent of  the non-profit industrial complex and its focusNorthern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)68 Grewal (n 52).69 Preamble.70 See, for example, the diverse work in S Ekine and H Abbas, Queer African Reader (Fahamu Books andPambazuka Press 2012).71 I Watson, ‘Illusionists and Hunters: Being Aboriginal in this Occupied Space’ (2005) 22 Australian FeministLaw Journal 15; A Moreton-Robinson, ‘The Possessive Logic of  Patriarchal White Sovereignty: The HighCourt and the Yorta Yorta Decision’ (2004) 3 borderlands ejournal; C Notzke, Aboriginal Peoples and NaturalResources in Canada (Captus University Publications 1994).72 P Wolfe, ‘Settler Colonialism and the Elimination of  the Native’ (2006) 8 Journal of  Genocide Research 387.3104n human rights,73 along with UN concern for the treatment of  indigenous peoples,74 statelaws aimed at the actual physical or cultural genocide of  indigenous peoples are untenable.However, focusing on the Australian government’s recent legislation enabling thecompulsory acquisition of  leases of  aboriginal land in the Northern Territory, I argue in thissection that law instead functions to appropriate subversive aboriginal identities. Thisprocess includes the appropriation of  aboriginal culture, but extends further. Aboriginalidentities are appropriated through the reshaping of  aboriginal spaces of  belonging. Whatis at stake in these leases is more than the land over which the leases are sought – it is alsothe social and cultural characteristics of  the communities that live on the land. Theresistance to the leases and the insistent claim of  aboriginal communities that ‘we are notmoving’ goes beyond an insistence on staying in the same physical place and extends to aninsistence that that place remains a space of  aboriginal belonging.The Northern Territory ‘intervention’ is the name used to describe the set of  policiesintroduced by the Australian Commonwealth government in August 2007. The interventionwas primarily enabled by the NTNERA. The Act followed a report by the NorthernTerritory government entitled Little Children are Sacred, which contained allegations ofwidespread child sex abuse in remote aboriginal communities in the territory.75 TheNorthern Territory is commonly regarded as the ‘most aboriginal’ area of  Australia becauseit has the highest aboriginal proportion of  its population of  any Australian jurisdiction (over30 per cent compared to the next highest 3.8 per cent),76 the highest number of  native titleland claims,77 and is the site of  the first and most significant aboriginal land rightslegislation in Australia (around 45 per cent of  the area of  the Northern Territory is nowaboriginal – owned under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth)(Land Rights Act), which is higher than in any other jurisdiction).78 Unlike the rest ofAustralia, the remote aboriginal communities of  the Northern Territory are areas wherewhite Australians may feel out of  place.The Northern Territory is one of  two mainland Australian territories, the other beingthe small area around the federal capital of  Canberra, and, although the territories are nowself-governing, they are still subject to having their laws overridden by the Commonwealthgovernment – a level of  intrusion from which the Australian states are immune. ThisCommonwealth power to override territory laws is enabled by s 122 of  the AustralianConstitution. Drawing on this power, the Commonwealth government announced on21 June 2007 that the levels of  child sex abuse in the Northern Territory’s aboriginalcommunities had become a national emergency to which the Northern Territorygovernment had failed to adequately respond. As such, the Commonwealth governmentwas to immediately pass emergency response legislation.Bringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities73 A Smith, ‘Introduction: The Revolution Will not be Funded’ in Incite!

These measures apply to ‘prescribed areas’ of  the Northern Territory,which are defined in the Act as all aboriginal land,79 as well as any other area declared bythe relevant minister, with the exact co-ordinates for the prescribed areas listed in a scheduleto the Act.80 All prescribed areas are those of  aboriginal communities.81 The NTNERAmeasures applicable in the prescribed areas include: a total ban on the possession andconsumption of  alcohol;82 compulsory income management for all welfare recipients;83compulsory installation of  anti-pornography filters on all public computers as well asobligatory record-keeping of  all computer users;84 cutting back of  the permit system forentry onto aboriginal land;85 federal government takeover of  local services and communitystores as well as a ministerial power to suspend all elected councillors;86 a ban on NorthernTerritory courts from taking customary law into account when dealing with bail applicationsand sentencing;87 and compulsory rent-free five-year leases of  aboriginal land to the federalgovernment.88 The NTNERA made itself  exempt from Australia’s Racial DiscriminationAct 1975 (Cth).89In terms of  aboriginal resistance to the intervention, the compulsory leases were thefocus of  anti-intervention campaigns, at least in the legal arena. Notably, traditional ownerReggie Wurridjal brought a High Court challenge against the Commonwealth government,claiming that the lease of  the Maningrida land on which he lived amounted to an unjustcompulsory acquisition of  property, contrary to s 51(xxxi) of  the Constitution. Along withother aboriginal elders, Wurridjal was recognised under the Land Rights Act as a traditionalowner of  the land in question. Like all land under the Act, the fee simple title is held by anAboriginal Land Trust for the benefit of  the relevant aboriginal people. The township ofManingrida was established as an instrument of  government policy in 1957.90 While manyaboriginal people have moved to the township of  Maningrida itself, many also continue tolive in outstations on the region, of  which there are over 30.91 The Bawinanga AboriginalCorporation operates a large and successful aboriginal employment scheme whereby thoseliving on the Maningrida outstations are paid to maintain them.92 Due to the relatively shorthistory of  white settlement and the relatively well-resourced support of  outstation living,aboriginal residents’ relationship with land in the Maningrida region is stronger than inother parts of  Australia and is also robustly defended in the face of  encroaching whitegovernance. In a long and complex decision, the High Court found that the compulsorylease of  the Maningrida area did not effect any acquisition of  property from WurridjalNorthern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)79 That is, land held on trust under the Land Rights Act.80 NTNERA, s 4.81 Based on a search of  all legislative instruments passed under NTNERA as at 15 February 2011.82 NTNERA, s 12.83 Ibid s 126.84 Ibid pt 3.85 Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Northern TerritoryEmergency Response and Other Measures) Act 2007, (Cth) sch 4.86 NTNERA, pt 5, division 4; pt 7.87 Ibid ss 90, 91.88 Ibid pt 4, division 1.89 Ibid s 132.90 J C Altman, Fresh Water in the Maningrida Region’s Hybrid Economy: Intercultural Contestation over Values and PropertyRights (CAEPR Australian National University Working Paper No 46 2008) 1.91 Ibid.92 ‘History’ (Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation, Darwin 2007) <www.bawinanga.com.au/meetbac/history.htm> accessed 1 March 2011.312himself, and that, although the leases did acquire property from the Land Trust, thatacquisition was on just terms.93From a property law perspective, the leases were unusual in many respects but notablyin that, although they granted the Commonwealth ‘exclusive possession and quietenjoyment of  the land while the lease is in force’,94 the Commonwealth never sought toenforce this right. Government officials made a point of  publicly insisting that the leasesdid not amount to a land grab.95 Indeed, then Prime Minister John Howard said, in reactionto land grab allegations, that ‘we’re offering a guarantee that we’re not taking anything fromanybody. We’re trying to give things back.’96 The question then is what was the governmenttaking, or at least trying to take, through these compulsory leases. The government assertedthat the leases ‘help to expand opportunities for business investment such as farming,tourism and retail businesses and home ownership’ and ‘offer opportunity for economicdevelopment and better housing and infrastructure’ for the benefit of  the existing aboriginalcommunities.97 In terms of  better housing and infrastructure, part of  the government’sargument for why it needed leases of  the land was that having long leases meant that itwould not have to go through bureaucratic approval processes in order to make repairs onhouses and impose maintenance conditions on individual renters.98 The minister stated thatthe leases would also allow the government to promote private home-ownership inaboriginal communities rather than the communal title under which almost all aboriginalland is currently held.99Anti-intervention campaigners pointed out that, contrary to the Commonwealth’s statedobjectives, housing for aboriginal people in the prescribed areas did not improve under theintervention leases, and any economic development has been negligible.100 However, whileactivists were understandably sceptical that the government control of  housing enabled bythe leases would come to mean ‘higher rents, more restrictive tenancy conditions and easiereviction’,101 there was no clear evidence that the Commonwealth used its leases to directlypush residents out of  their homes.102 The Commonwealth government’s rationale for thefive-year leases shifted over time and was generally ambiguous.103 Paddy Gibson argues thatthe leases were an attack on the gains won in the aboriginal land rights struggle, namelyBringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities93 Wurridjal v The Commonwealth of  Australia [2009] HCA 2.94 NTNERA, s 35(1).95 ‘QC Rejects NT Land Grab Fears’ (ABC News, Sydney 17 July 2007) <www.abc.net.au/news/2007–07–11/qc-rejects-nt-land-grab-fears/96634> accessed 3 December 2011.96 P Karvelas and S Parnell, ‘Communal Land up for Grabs’, The Australian (Sydney 30 June 2007)<www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/communal-land-up-for-grabs/story-e6frg6nf-1111113856963>accessed 24 August 2011.97 J Macklin, ‘Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory’ (Australian Government Discussion Paper June 2011)13 and 22.98 Karvelas and Parnell (n 96).99 Ibid.

The fact that the leases seemedfrom the start to be mainly symbolic (because the government made clear its lack ofintention to take up its right to exclusive possession) and yet have been the most contestedaspect of  the intervention suggests that the government was still ‘taking’ something; thatthere was a materiality to the ‘symbolic’ property being acquired.The property being acquired or ‘taken’ through the compulsory leases was aboriginal,not just in terms of  the type of  legal title the land was held under, the identity of  theclaimants or the majority racial group living on the land, but also in terms of  the broader,contested space of  belonging of  post-contact Australia. What was being appropriatedthrough the intervention leases was not so much the right to exclusive possession of  theland in the prescribed areas, as it was the holding up of  aboriginal identities in those spaces.A group of  aboriginal activists called the Prescribed Area Peoples’ Alliance released astatement following a meeting in June 2009 stating, that the intervention measures ‘arepushing us into a corner. That will mean they will take away everything we belong to . . . Ifpeople are forced to leave off  homelands they will lose everything, their identity.’105 Thisreference to aboriginal identity, and to ‘everything we belong to’ (emphasis added)demonstrates the part–whole belonging that is at stake here – although the lease in questionin Wurridjal v The Commonwealth clearly involved a change in which subject the objectbelonged to, what was more important to the aboriginal people affected by the leases wasthe threatened change in the whole (culture) of  which they were a part. The space ofbelonging produced by property in the leases affects both the control of  the land and thesubjectivities of  those who live on it. The appropriation of  aboriginal identity through thereshaping of  spaces of  aboriginal belonging was at stake.The term ‘homelands’ is instructive, as is the spatial reference to being ‘pushed into acorner’. Although various definitions exist, the key characteristics of  homelands are thatthey are aboriginal-initiated, permanent communities that are distant from non-aboriginalsettlements both cartographically and culturally.106 Beyond its geographical meaning, theidea of  homelands captures something of  the spatial understanding of  property, thesubject–object and part–whole belonging, the importance of  land and the importance ofhome and the connection between them. Homelands are spaces of  aboriginal belongingwhere being aboriginal is held up. Because they are not just a set of  physical places butrather a space of  aboriginal belonging, the homelands can be depleted both physically andculturally – by being forced to move from one location to another and also by having theirdistinctive characteristics maligned or dissolved. At the same time though, the homelandsare a space that cannot be annihilated by compulsory leases or bulldozers alone. Like allspaces, the homelands are not frozen in time, but will shift and adapt from moment tomoment, and across physical locations.The homelands are a kind of  subversive property in that the relation of  belongingbetween aboriginal people and their land and culture – a relation that is out of  placeaccording to dominant Australian understandings of  what and who belong where – is heldup in the homelands.

Ampilatwatja is a community of  the Alyawarr people and land.107 In June2009 the people of  the Ampilatwatja community, supported by several Australian tradeunions, walked off  their town site in protest against the intervention, and started buildingnew accommodation and infrastructure on a site 3km away, just outside the boundaries ofthe intervention’s ‘prescribed areas’.108 Despite its physical move, the Ampilatwatjacommunity retained its space of  belonging, which is no doubt altered from what it was atthe last site but is still a space where aboriginal bodies and cultural practices belong.Spokespeople from the walk-off  site have emphasised their rejection of  the government’sregime, their spiritual connection to the land and intention to live under their own customsand laws forever.109 Walk-off  spokespeople have, for example, stated to the governmentthat ‘we’re never ever going to go back to that community to live under your controls andmeasures’;110 and that their action of  walking outside the borders of  the prescribed areas:leads us not to Canberra but to Country, not to further assimilation throughdependency but to a continuing way of  life, not to western law but to our own,not to hand fed scraps and the confines and indignities of  the ration mentalityand manufactured ‘real economies’ but to self  reliance, learning by doing anddirect responsibility for self, Family and the coming generations.111The Ampilatwatja people’s location and declaration that they will not be moving unsettledthe Commonwealth government112 and created ripples of  media attention.113 Theirs is aclaim to property, not just in the sense that the land which they have moved to belongs tothem, but also in the sense that as a community they are part of  an aboriginal culturedistinct from the dominant non-aboriginal cultures of  wider Australia. It is a claim that theirspace of  belonging should prevail, that their relation of  belonging to their land and cultureshould be held up. Whereas the Wurridjal v The Commonwealth case challenged thegovernment’s power to take property in aboriginal land, the walk-off  literally moved awayfrom the law and took the community’s aboriginal space of  belonging with it.Conclusion: law’s appropriations and the spatiality of identityThe socio-legal issues of  sexuality-based asylum claims and of  compulsory leases ofaboriginal land in Australia have in common a contestation over property – both involvedattempts to assert that particular relations of  belonging should be held up in particularBringing the outside(r) in: law’s appropriation of subversive identities107 ‘Ampilatwatja’ (Barkly Shire Council) <www.barkly.nt.gov.au/our-communities/ampilatwatja/> accessed12 December 2011.108 ‘About’ (Intervention Walkoff ’s Blog, Alice Springs 23 July 2009) <http://interventionwalkoff.wordpress.com/about> accessed 23 March 2010; J Dheerasekara, ‘Back to Country: Alyawarr Resistance’(Alice Springs 2009) <http://vimeo.com/12577970> accessed 12 December 2011.109 ‘Ampilatwatja Walkoff  – Aboriginal Australia Today’ (The Juice Media 25 October 2009)<www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nJKEl9asqQ&feature=related> accessed 12 December 2011.110 R Downs, ‘NT Aboriginal Leaders Condemn Intervention, Housing Program Failure’ (Sydney 7 October2009) <http://interventionwalkoff.wordpress.com/media-releases/> accessed 12 December 2011.111 J Hartley, ‘Message from John Hartley’ (Northern Territory 2010) <http://interventionwalkoff.wordpress.com/statements/> accessed 12 December 2011.112 The minister has not released an official statement on the walk-off  but is clearly aware of  its presence.

In regards to the leases, that contestation was over whether aboriginal or Anglo-Australian spaces of  belonging would be dominant in the remote communities of  theNorthern Territory. In regards to the cases of  women claiming asylum on the basis ofsexuality persecution, that contestation was over what kinds of  sexualities will be held up andafforded a space within the receiving state. Whereas the Australian cases involved assertionsof  subversive (aboriginal) property and the refugee cases involved the reorientation of  whatwas a subversive (queer) property, both sets of  cases demonstrate the significant, pervasivesocial power of  property – its production as well as requirement of  particular spaces ofbelonging. These studies show the complexity of  the relationship between property,identity, belonging and space. Law appropriates subversive identities by reshaping the spacesthat hold up those identities. The spatial understanding of  property as belonging putforward in this article can be used to illuminate the ways in which law appropriatessubversive identities, which operate as property on both subject–object and part–wholelevels. However, while law appropriates, resistance continues on the outside, through thebuilding and maintenance of  spaces that hold up subversive relations of  belonging.Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly 64(3)316",

    "abstract": "This article explores some of the ways in which law appropriates subversive identities. Drawing on work from geographical, feminist and critical race approaches to property, I put forward an understanding of property as a relation of belonging ‘held up’ by space. Building on this understanding, I argue that identity can operate as property in the same way that land and material objects can, and that law appropriates subversive identities by bringing them into its hegemonic space of recognition and regulation. Law’s appropriations have a range of effects on both the individual subjects directly involved in legal proceedings and the broader spaces in and through which those subjects forge their identities. Specifically this article explores the appropriation of gay and lesbian identities in the context of immigration law, and of aboriginal identities in the context of Australia’s Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007 (Cth) (NTNERA)",
