Wade Threatens to Destabilize the LGBTQ+ Legal Landscape Today Dane Brody Chanove* For the first time in nearly thirty years, in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the United States Supreme Court was asked, again, to overturn its landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade finding a constitutional right to an abortion. And with three new Trump appointees and a 6-3 conservative majority, it was finally able to do just that. The Court’s decision in Dobbs has called into question not just the safety of abortion but of other constitutional rights grounded in similar tradition and legal doctrine. This Note considers the effects that the Dobb’s decision could have on LGBTQ+ rights in particular and proceeds in four parts. Part I analyzes the cultural similarities underlying the issues of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Part II surveys the current Court’s attitude toward abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as its attitude toward the doctrine of stare decisis. Part III analyzes the analogous legal doctrines utilized by the majorities in landmark abortion and LGBTQ+ rights cases. Part IV considers the effects that the overruling of Roe could have on existing LGBTQ+ precedent today and suggests that—to the extent those precedents are put at risk—modern practitioners going before the Court should seek to actively decouple these issues in the eyes of the Justices.    * J.D.

Although nothing is certain, no one should doubt that a decision overturning Roe v. Wade would be the constitutional equivalent of a very large butterfly.”1 INTRODUCTION On December 1, 2021, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the matter of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.2 The case involved the constitutionality of Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act,3 a 2018 law banning abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. The question presented to the Court was “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”4 On June 24, 2022, the Court responded with a resounding “No,” holding that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and expressly overturning its landmark rulings in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which found that women have a constitutional right to abortion prior to fetal viability.5 In choosing to hear Dobbs, the United States Supreme Court “put Roe on the docket,”6 with many correctly positing that it would be overturned.7 Concerns  1.

Almost immediately after the Court announced its intent to hear the case, legal and political commentators began to question the continued viability of established LGBTQ+ precedent in the face of a Court willing to square against Roe.8 Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned during oral argument of the potential for challenges to LGBTQ+ rights cases if the Court were to overturn Roe.9 But why is this? On their face, abortion and LGBTQ+ rights embody two separate and distinct issues. Indeed, diverging public opinion on the two has led even some religious commentators to claim that these classic “values” issues have been decoupled.10 Assertions like this, however, while representative of the current cultural climate outside of the Court, have yet to permeate the walls of an institution made up entirely of Justices from a different generational zeitgeist—one that has historically viewed issues of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights in tandem.11 These assertions thus conflate “popular opinion” with the opinion of the Court12 and overlook the extent to which abortion and LGBTQ+ precedent inform one another under the Court’s present jurisprudence.

Given that the nomination of Supreme Court Justices is perhaps the purest form of party politics, it seems fair to posit that the opinion of the Court would lag behind that of the public. 12. The same ethos demanding insulation of the Court from public opinion calling for the restriction of certain constitutional rights would also seem to insulate it from public opinion calling for those same rights ’ expansion.

I. CULTURAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ABORTION AND LGBTQ+ RIGHTS In 1991, sociologist James Davison Hunter popularized the term “culture wars” to describe the conflicts over the so-called values issues that have increasingly engendered political debate in contemporary America.17 These include issues regarding the family, art, education, law, and politics.18 And while it would be a mistake to say that any one issue “is the beginning and end of the contemporary culture war,”19 the term has perhaps most often been understood to denote the conflicts over abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.20 Cultural and sociological research placing the two rights, and the social movements that gave rise to each, in concert with one another is rich and extensive,21 and the numerous similarities and differences that exist between the two cannot be addressed in a Note of this scope. Rather, this Part limits its discussion to those similarities underlying abortion and LGBTQ+ rights that are most determinative in leading to the coupling of the two issues in popular parlance. Perhaps the most fundamental similarity between the two, both abortion and LGBTQ+ rights “challenge deeply held social norms about gender and sexuality,”22  13. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). 14. See Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015). 15. See Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). 16. This Note limits its discussion of stare decisis to “horizontal” stare decisis (that is, whether, and under what circumstances, the Court should overrule itself). This is contrasted with “vertical” stare decisis, whereby a lower court is obligated to follow the precedent of a higher court. 17.

Indeed, speaking of sexual relations between same-sex couples, former Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Warren Burger wrote, “Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian [sic] moral and ethical standards.”24 This type of religious opposition to the two issues, grounded in biblical doctrine, is perhaps best exemplified in the Manhattan Declaration, released in 2009 by Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and Evangelical Christian leaders, to affirm support for “the sanctity of human life, the dignity of marriage as a union of husband and wife, and the freedom of conscience and religion.”25 The document states broadly that: we will not comply with any edict that purports to compel our institutions to participate in abortions . . . nor will we bend to any rule purporting to force us to bless immoral sexual partnerships, treat them as marriages or the equivalent, or refrain from proclaiming the truth, as we know it, about morality and immorality and marriage and the family.26 It is within this conceptualization of morality—one informed by religion and which has historically viewed abortion and LGBTQ+ rights as immoral counterparts—that popular attitudes toward the two issues have been framed. While abortion and LGBTQ+ rights possess this foundational commonality, it is important to acknowledge some of the key differences between the two that would, at least on their face, lend support to contentions that LGBTQ+ rights can be sufficiently distinguished from abortion, so as to be immunized from reversal despite the current Court’s decision to overturn Roe. Perhaps the most oft cited distinction between abortion and LGBTQ+ rights today is the varying levels of public support for each. While public opinion behind abortion has stayed relatively constant, public opinion in support of LGBTQ+ rights has grown dramatically in recent years.27 Trust in public opinion polls as reliable indicators of the safety of LGBTQ+ rights, however, may ultimately be misplaced.28 The annual number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills filed across state legislatures has skyrocketed from forty-one bills in 2018 to 238 bills in less than three months of 2022.29 As of the time of the  23.

In a 2020 segment on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson called the concept of a transgender child “grotesque”33 and said that supportive parents are “abusing their children.”34 Appearing to heed this call, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, less than two years later, issued a directive to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, ordering the agency to investigate instances of gender-affirming health care for transgender minors as “child abuse.”35 Actions like these, as well as others recently taken by democratically elected officials purporting to espouse the beliefs of a majority of their state,36 run counter to the assertion that public opinion so  30.

Whatever differences exist between the two that would support the contention that LGBTQ+ rights have been—or, more properly, should be—removed from today’s modern conceptualization of the “culture wars,” and thus decoupled from issues involving abortion, opponents of LGBTQ+ rights on the Court have expressly grounded their opposition in the understanding that no such decoupling has occurred.43  37.

The majority in Dobbs appears to adopt this very view. See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., 597 U.S. ___, 71 (2022) (“ [R]ights regarding contraception and same-sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey termed ‘potential life.’ ”). 40. Goldberg, supra note 21, at 25. 41. Id. 42. To the extent that this view could still be rebutted on the grounds that both abortion and LGBTQ+ rights find legal support based in substantive due process, see infra Part III, so that a person cannot support one while opposing the other, “ support for [LGBTQ+ rights] goes far beyond constitutional exegesis: It is entirely possible to support [LGBTQ+ rights] in principle without believing that the [C]onstitution commands its legalization nationwide.” Stern, supra note 39. 43.

In her acceptance speech following her nomination to the United States Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a former clerk for the late Justice Antonin Scalia, described her approach to the law in a single sentence: “A judge must apply the law as written.”50 Adherence to this brand of judicial interpretation, known as “textualism” or “originalism,” presents unique challenges with regards to stare decisis. Justice Barrett, in her own words, has acknowledged the “tension between stare decisis and originalism,”51 admitting that “[J]ustices who subscribe to text-based theories are more likely than others to encounter conflict between precedent and jurisprudential commitment.”52 When such a conflict occurs, according to Justice Barrett, a Justice’s literal interpretation of the text should prevail.53 It is perhaps for this reason that Justice Barrett has argued that “a more relaxed form of constitutional stare decisis”54—that is, one that makes it easier for Justices to “reject[ ] a predecessor majority’s methodological approach in favor of their own”55—is “both inevitable and probably desirable.”56 Providing us with a clue as to the types of cases she would consider to be beyond reproach, Justice Barrett, in a Texas Law Review article published in 2013, cited to a list of cases commonly regarded as “super precedents” by legal academics and scholars. These are decisions that are “so woven in the fabric of law”57 that “no serious person would propose to undo [them] even if they are wrong.”58 Noticeably absent from this list is Roe v.

Wade.”69 Like Justice Barrett, Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh subscribe to Justice Scalia’s particular brand of originalism.70 Since joining the Court, each Justice voted twice in abortion cases prior to Dobbs—both times in favor of restrictions. In 2020, each Justice dissented in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo,71 a case striking down a Louisiana abortion law that would have forced all but one of the state’s abortion providers to close,72 and in 2021, they voted with the majority to allow S.B. 8 to take effect.73 Justice Kavanaugh ruled on only one other case involving abortion as a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In that case, Garza v. Hargan,74 Justice Kavanaugh, sitting on a panel of three judges, ruled that blocking an undocumented immigrant held in federal custody from receiving an abortion and forcing her to continue her pregnancy for multiple more weeks until such time as she was able to obtain a sponsor, did not unduly burden the woman’s right to an abortion under existing precedent.75 The argument can certainly be made that cases like this, which involved nuanced and unique circumstances, while implicating Roe, were not targeted at its central holding. Indeed, in his dissent to the court’s decision upon rehearing to overturn his initial ruling, Justice Kavanaugh takes care to note that “all parties to this case recognize  68.

Casey are precedents we must follow.”76 And while words like these, upon first glance, would have seemed to quell any suggestion that Roe was at risk, the Dobbs decision ultimately revealed them for what they truly were: mere platitudes, rather than any kind of sincere acknowledgment of, or reverence toward, established precedent. Showing his hand, Justice Kavanaugh, during oral argument in Dobbs, presented a list of cases in which the Court overturned long-held precedents and asked counsel for Jackson Women’s Health Organization why the “right answer,” with regards to Roe and Casey, was not to “return to the position of neutrality . . . and not stick with those precedents in the same way that all those other cases didn’t?”77 This suggestion that the Court ignore its longstanding abortion precedent stands in stark contrast with Justice Kavanaugh’s statement in Garza and suggests that Justice Kavanaugh had no intention of being constrained by the Court’s past rulings in Roe and Casey. The attitudes of the remaining conservative Justices toward abortion and stare decisis fare no better. Justice Thomas, the Court’s longest-serving and most conservative78 Justice, has expressed his philosophy regarding stare decisis as follows: “When faced with demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.”79 One such example of “demonstrably erroneous” precedent, according to Justice Thomas, is the Court’s rulings on abortion.80 Justice Thomas voted to overturn Roe in 1992, in his first term on the Court, when he dissented in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,81 and he continues to maintain that the Court’s abortion jurisprudence is “grievously wrong.”82 His closest ideological counterpart on the Court, Justice Alito, has expressed similar views towards abortion. In a 1985 application to become deputy assistant to U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, III, Justice Alito made reference to certain “legal positions in which [he] personally believe[s] very strongly,”83 one of which being that “the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion.”84 While insisting that he  76.

In 2007, the Chief Justice joined the majority in Gonzales v. Carhart,87 which upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.88 While joining with the liberal justices to author a concurring opinion in June Medical Services,89 Chief Justice Roberts dissented in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt 90 just four years earlier, voting to uphold a nearly identical Texas abortion law. The Chief Justice made clear in his concurrence in June Medical Services that he continued to disagree with the majority’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health, but that under the principle of stare decisis, the cases should be treated alike.91 B. LGBTQ+ Rights In addition to his promise to nominate “pro-life” Justices to the Court, President Trump also stated that he would “strongly consider” nominating Justices who would reverse Obergefell v. Hodges.92 That case, which found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,93 was decided by a narrow 5-4 ruling, with Justice Kennedy casting the deciding vote. While the Court’s opinion represented a victory for LGBTQ+ rights advocates, the thin margin on which it was decided serves as a stark reminder that the Court’s attitude towards such rights is anything but unanimous. Following Justice Kennedy’s retirement, today’s Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has a new median Justice in the form of Justice Kavanaugh.94 A former clerk for Justice Kennedy, Justice Kavanaugh is more conservative than his “median Justice” predecessor.95 Prior to his time on the Supreme Court, very little was known about Justice Kavanaugh’s attitude toward LGBTQ+ rights.  85.

Circuit, Justice Kavanaugh never ruled on or wrote about legal issues related to LGBTQ+ people.96 Since his appointment to the Supreme Court, however, he has heard two cases involving LGBTQ+ rights. The first, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia,97 involved a Catholic foster care agency that refused to certify same-sex couples as foster parents. While Justice Kavanaugh voted to allow this practice by the foster care agency to continue, the decision was unanimous—based on a procedural quirk in the city’s contract with the foster care agency.98 Thus, Fulton’s use as a litmus test for attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues is limited. The second case, Bostock v. Clayton County,99 is more informative. In that case, the Court held that an employer who fires an individual based on their sexual orientation or gender identity violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.100 Justice Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that Title VII’s prohibition on discrimination “because of . . . sex” does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, or by extension, transgender status.101 Justice Gorsuch, another former Kennedy clerk, also departs from his mentor’s judicial philosophy and constitutional jurisprudence. A staunch originalist,102 it is somewhat perplexing that Justice Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in Bostock103—there is no reference to sexual orientation or gender identity in the text of the statute itself.104 However, in extending workplace protections to LGBTQ+ persons, “the Court was performing an act of statutory interpretation, a very different issue than interpreting the Constitution to find a constitutional right to marriage equality”105 or other LGBTQ+ rights. Indeed, just three years earlier, Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, dissented in Pavan v. Smith,106 which found that a state law that precludes same-sex couples from having both spouses’ names on a birth certificate violates the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause under Obergefell.107 Justice Gorsuch has written in the past that  96.

The city failed to grant the foster care agency an exemption. The Court ruled that non-discrimination laws apply to taxpayer-funded child services so long as they are enforced neutrally but determined that the city’ s law was not neutral. In framing the ruling this way, the Court was able to avoid discussion of sexual orientation specifically, focusing instead on procedure. See id. at 1877–81. 99. 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). 100.

In 2015, Justice Barrett signed on to a letter defining marriage as the “indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman,”110 and during a 2016 talk at Jacksonville University Public Policy Institute, Justice Barrett questioned whether the Supreme Court should have taken up Obergefell at all.111 These sentiments, made within just a year and a half of the Obergefell decision, “can only be understood as a rejection of the equal legal status of LGBTQ couples, and a warning shot with respect to the legitimacy that [Justice Barrett] would afford that decision.”112 Apparently foreshadowing the lack of precedential value Justice Barrett would assign to Obergefell and its progeny, Justice Barrett, when confronted with Obergefell’s exclusion from the list of so-called “superprecedents” during her confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, again declined to characterize any of the landmark LGBTQ+ rights decisions as such.113 Justice Barrett’s attitude towards LGBTQ+ issues in the Court is not limited to gay marriage and matters of constitutional interpretation. Speaking on the Court’s decision to take up the case of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G.,114 involving a New Jersey school board’s transgender bathroom ban, Justice Barrett called the interpretation of Title IX’s prohibition on discrimination based on sex as including gender identity a “strain [on] the text of the statute.”115 While falling somewhere near the ideological middle of the current Court,116 “[Chief Justice] Roberts is no centrist conservative with a record of joining the left  108.

In 2013, Chief Justice Roberts dissented in United States v. Windsor.118 There, the Court struck down a key provision in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which federally defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman and, in so doing, formally recognized same-sex marriages at the federal level.119 Two years later, when the Court was once again asked to confront the issue of marriage equality—this time with regards to whether individual states must recognize and license same-sex marriages—Chief Justice Roberts again dissented, calling the Obergefell decision “deeply disheartening”120 and stating that the Constitution “had nothing to do with it.”121 Especially revealing, the Chief Justice read a summary of his twenty-nine page dissent out loud from the bench—the first and only time he has taken such a step in his nearly two decades on the Court.122 In perhaps the most brazen demonstration of anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment on the Court today, Justices Thomas and Alito, both of whom dissented in the Obergefell decision, issued a statement renewing their criticism of the landmark opinion and calling for its reversal following the Court’s denial of certiorari in a case brought by Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue a marriage license for same-sex couples.123 In the statement, Justice Thomas, writing for himself and Justice Alito, lambasted the Court for “undemocratically”124 reading a “novel constitutional right”125 into the Fourteenth Amendment, “even though that right is found nowhere in the text.”126 Justice Thomas stated that “Obergefell enables courts and governments to brand religious adherents who believe that marriage is between one man and one woman as bigots”127 and characterized the Kim Davis case as a “stark reminder”128 of the “ruinous consequences”129 of Obergefell. While ultimately agreeing with the Court’s decision not to take up the case, Justice Thomas urged that “the Court has created a problem that only it can fix”130 and appeared to call on anti-LGBTQ+ rights groups to bring a case to the  117.

Justice Alito echoed this sentiment in a talk given to conservative group The Federalist Society.132 Both Justices have been stalwart opponents of the Court’s LGBTQ+ jurisprudence, dissenting in every major LGBTQ+ case to go before the Court during their respective times on the bench, with Justice Thomas even dissenting in Lawrence v. Texas,133 the 2003 decision guaranteeing same-sex couples a right so basic and fundamental as the right to physical intimacy.134 III. LEGAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ABORTION AND LGBTQ+ RIGHTS The Court’s LGBTQ+ rights jurisprudence is “built on the foundation of Roe and Casey and the [C]ourt’s other reproductive rights cases.”135 This is because both lines of cases derive their authority from the doctrine of substantive due process. Substantive due process asks the question of whether the government’s deprivation of a person’s life, liberty, or property is justified by a sufficient purpose.136 If a right is deemed fundamental under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment, the government must meet strict scrutiny in order to show a substantive justification that is adequate.137 Courts are thus able to “use substantive due process to safeguard rights that are not otherwise enumerated in the [C]onstitution.”138 Falling within this category of rights not explicitly safeguarded in the Constitution are those involving abortion and LGBTQ+ issues. In Roe v. Wade,139 the Court expressly declared that the right to privacy is guaranteed under the liberty of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment140 and that this right “is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.”141 As such, a statute “that excepts from criminality only a life-saving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to her pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”142 The Court reaffirmed the central holding of Roe in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern  131.

Casey,143 reiterating that “[c]onsitutional protection of the woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment”144 and that “[i]f the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of an individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.”145 More generally, the Court held that “[t]hese matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.”146 Citing this passage from Casey in Lawrence v. Texas,147 the Court went on to find that the right of privacy also protects an individual’s choice to engage in same-sex sex, declaring that “individual decisions by [two adults], concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of ‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”148 And while Lawrence “[did] not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter,”149 the Court eventually took that step in Obergefell v. Hodges,150 holding that “the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment couples of the same sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty.”151 What is particularly noteworthy about the connection between the Court’s abortion and LGBTQ+ jurisprudence is that it is the very thing that links the two lines of cases that makes them so vulnerable to attack by the Court’s current majority. The idea that the Due Process Clause has more than a procedural component has been the source of much controversy,152 facing historic opposition from originalist Justices “who believe there is no such thing as substantive due process”153 and “take the position that fundamental rights are limited to those liberties explicitly stated in the text or clearly intended by the framers.”154 Perhaps the most fervent opponent of substantive due process, Justice Scalia, during his time  143. 505 U.S. 833, 845–46 (1992) (“After considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v.

One of the country’s preeminent scholars on constitutional law, Erwin Chemerinsky explains: This way of defining liberty interests shows that virtually no rights [are] protected under substantive due process, because if a right was already protected, there would be no reason to have the Court do it. The fact that the right is not protected shows there is no tradition of protecting the right stated at the most specific level of abstraction.161 Justice Scalia’s approach to substantive due process, then, can more accurately be viewed as akin to judicial sabotage—attempting to leave the doctrine wholly intact, but dead in the water. And given President Trump’s promise to nominate Justices to the Court who are “in the mold of Justice Scalia,”162 it is hard to imagine that the Court’s three newest members do not share the late Justice’s sentiment.

EFFECT OF OVERRULING ROE ON LGBTQ+ PRECEDENT Given the current Court’s attitude toward abortion, its demonstrated hostility towards substantive due process, and each Justice in the majority’s expressed willingness to break from established precedent, it is not particularly surprising that an overruling decision occurred.176 That the decision took the form of a single, wholesale reversal of Roe, however—as opposed to a slow, incremental dismantling of the Court’s abortion jurisprudence—does suggest cause for heightened concern. Prior to the Court’s publishing of its final decision, legal commentators had warned that “[e]ven if a Supreme Court decision overruling Roe were initially written in the most modest possible terms . . . it would still be hasty and misleading to conclude that the decision would have no effect on constitutional jurisprudence protecting fundamental rights outside the sphere of abortion rights.”177 The Court’s outright reversal of Roe seems to signal a brazen majority, unaverse to brash decisions and the acceleration of the ultraconservative brand of Republicanism advocated by Trump and his constituents. And while the majority in Dobbs purports to make clear that “[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,”178 Justice Thomas’s concurrence explicitly calls for the use of Dobbs as a foundation to “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including . . . Lawrence and Obergefell.”179 The decision to overturn Roe—and by extension, Casey—implicates existing LGBTQ+ caselaw both directly and indirectly. In Lawrence, the Court cited extensively to Casey in finding a right to same-sex sex under the liberty of the Due Process Clause.180 The majority’s reliance on the Court’s abortion jurisprudence to  persuading one’ s fellow citizens is one thing, and imposing one’ s views in absence of democratic majority will is something else. .  .  .  What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action, and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand-new ‘constitutional right ’ by a Court that is impatient of democratic change.”); Obergefell v.

One response, at least with regard to Obergefell, is that Justice Kennedy’s fusing of substantive due process and equal protection immunizes the case from overruling, even in the face of the Court’s decision to overturn Roe.185 The novelty of this combination, however, and its effectiveness in sufficiently distinguishing Obergefell, appear to be overstated. While ultimately grounding its decision in substantive due process, “the Casey decision has strong notes of equal protection throughout its discussion.”186 Indeed, Erwin Chemerinsky has written that “the Court, for the first time [in Casey], found abortion rights under equal protection.”187 Thus, while Obergefell certainly makes explicit what the Court’s abortion jurisprudence had, up until that point, “merely hinted at,”188 the equality element is still present. It seems reasonable to posit, then, that—given the ease with which the Court overturned Roe and Casey—it would have no problem ignoring Justice Kennedy’s equal protection argument in Obergefell. Indeed, Chief Justice Roberts says as much in his dissent, claiming that Justice Kennedy’s finding of a synergy between the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause based on the fact that “some precedents relying on one Clause have also relied on the other” does not “seriously engage with [the equal protection] claim.”189 More broadly, the decision to overrule Roe and Casey represents a departure by the Court from its approach to stare decisis generally—what at least one legal commentator has dubbed the “liberty thesis.”190 Under this approach, a prior decision that takes an expansive view of constitutionally based liberty rights is much  181.

In Casey, the Court laid out four criteria that the Court should consider when deciding whether to overturn established precedent: (1) whether the prior decision has proven unworkable; (2) whether the rule has engendered a “kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling”; (3) whether later cases have undermined the doctrinal basis so that it remains “no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine”; and (4) “whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification.”193 And, while the stare decisis analysis of Roe in Casey is plausible, it is “not overwhelmingly convincing.”194 That the Casey Court ruled to uphold Roe, then, in spite of this weak stare decisis argument, provides a “direct suggestion[ ] that liberty was used as a component of its stare decisis analysis.”195 The decision to overturn Roe suggests that the Court has removed liberty from its stare decisis analysis. With the proposed contraction of a recognized liberty interest no longer effectively triggering a presumption against overruling—and with Justices like Amy Coney Barrett already advocating for a form of stare decisis more relaxed than the test set out in Casey196—it would seem that the Court’s current conservative supermajority would have no problem paring back existing LGBTQ+ rights, even in the face of conflicting precedent. Counteracting the effects that the overruling decision of Roe could have on LGBTQ+ precedent will require practitioners going before the Court to shift from a legal strategy that has, for years, focused on drawing out the similarities between abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, to one that places nearly exclusive emphasis on their differences. What form that emphasis must take was largely dependent on how the Court chose to pare back Roe and its progeny. Had the Court opted to keep Roe and Casey intact and instead lower the cut-off for viability—as Chief Justice Roberts seemed to insinuate during oral argument in Dobbs197—LGBTQ+ practitioners would have wanted to appeal directly to the purported distinction, discussed in Part I of this Note, that abortion implicates the sanctity of life in a way that LGBTQ+  191. Id. at 1138. This approach was alluded to in Dobbs, both during oral argument as well as in amicus briefs filed with the Court. See Transcript of Oral Argument, supra note 9, at 85 (U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392 (U.S. argued Dec. 1, 2021) (“Even when the Court has reconsidered its constitutional rulings, it rarely–if ever–overrules precedent to take away previously recognized individual rights .  .  .

Ultimately, however, given the Justices’ decision to reverse Roe and Casey outright, practitioners will want to emphasize differences that distinguish the substantive due process analysis between the two—for example, by pointing to what many opponents of abortion consider to be Roe and Casey’s relatively weak reliance argument198 compared with that created by LGBTQ+ rights cases.199 On its face, the disentanglement of abortion and LGBTQ+ issues provides LGBTQ+ rights practitioners with a viable litigation strategy following Roe’s reversal. But even more than that, distinguishing LGBTQ+ rights from abortion serves to remove LGBTQ+ rights from today’s conceptualization of the culture wars. By viewing LGBTQ+ rights in isolation from abortion, the purported “morality” that placed LGBTQ+ issues within the purview of the culture wars to begin with can be seen for what it truly is: nothing more than recoded normative religiosity.200 And while this means of framing morality, based in religion, may be permissible for individual citizens, it is unacceptable in a body bound by the Constitution to be a neutral arbiter of the law and prohibited from running afoul of the Establishment Clause. CONCLUSION The case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization201 reverses nearly fifty years of precedent and represents one of the only times in American history that the Supreme Court has taken away a fundamental right.202 While Dobbs  198. See, e.g., Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. at 956–57 (1992) (Rehnquist, C.J., with whom White, J., Scalia, J., and Thomas, J., join, concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The joint opinion thus turns to what can only be described as an unconventional—and unconvincing—notion of reliance, a view based on the surmise that the availability of abortion since Roe has led to ‘ two decades of economic and social developments ’ that would be undercut if the error of Roe were recognized. The joint opinion’ s assertion of this fact is undeveloped and totally conclusory. In fact, one cannot be sure to what economic and social developments the opinion is referring. Surely it is dubious to suggest that women have reached their ‘places in society ’ in reliance upon Roe, rather than as a result of their determination to obtain higher education and compete with men in the job market, and of society’ s increasing recognition of their ability to fill positions that were previously thought to be reserved only for men.” (internal citations omitted)). 199. The majority implies as much in the Dobbs opinion itself. See Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 597 U. S. ____, 71–72 (2022) (“Each precedent is subject to its own stare decisis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance and workability are different for these cases than for our abortion jurisprudence.”). A more convincing argument can be made, for example, regarding the interests conferred upon same-sex couples who are already married in reliance on Obergefell. These include rights of inheritance, custody, pensions, tax status, and much more. 200. Indeed, while there are many who believe that the legality of gay marriage should be left to the states, few would say the same of interracial marriage. The only thing reconciling this seemingly contradictory view, is the religious edict that marriage be between “a man and a woman.” 201. No. 19-1392 (U.S. argued Dec. 1, 2021). 202. As Christopher M. Richardson pointed out in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times, after the Dobbs decision ended federal protections for abortion, some high-profile responses suggested the ruling marked the “ first time” the Supreme Court rescinded an established fundamental right. However, this is not accurate. During Reconstruction and the end of the Nineteenth Century, Black Americans gained, then lost, basic rights at the hands of the Supreme Court by way of the Civil Rights Cases. Christopher M. Richardson, OpEd: Dobbs Isn’t the First Time the Supreme Court Took Away Key Rights, L.A. TIMES ( July 15, 2022, 3:00 AM), https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-07-15/supreme-court-abortion-civil-rights [perma.cc/H7RE-DN27]. First to Print_Brody Chanove.docx (Do Not Delete) 4/14/23  9:38 AM 2023] A TOUGH ROE TO HOE 1065 represents a direct affront to the Court’s longstanding abortion jurisprudence, the potential effects of the ruling are not limited to reproductive rights. The decision in the case signals a willingness by the Court’s new conservative supermajority, emboldened by the recent appointments of three Trump-nominees, to challenge precedent previously considered to be largely out of reach. Especially vulnerable, given the cultural and legal similarities to abortion, is the Court’s LGBTQ+ rights jurisprudence.203 Dobbs thus threatens to be the proverbial thread the Court has been waiting to pull in order to unravel protections established in landmark cases like Lawrence v. Texas204 and Obergefell v. Hodges.205 To stop this from happening, practitioners going before the Court must change course, making a concerted effort to distinguish LGBTQ+ issues from those involving abortion and ultimately ensure that any Justice hoping to wind back the clock on LGBTQ+ rights has a tough row to hoe.    203. Given Congress’ s passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, Pub. L. No. 117-228 (2022), in response to the Court’ s ruling in Dobbs, there will be those tempted to dismiss this argument as moot. And while statutory protections for gay marriage are certainly a significant step in the right direction, they are by no means as robust a protection as a constitutionally enshrined right to the same. Indeed, one need only look to the fate of the antithetical Defense of Marriage Act, Pub. L. No. 104-199, 110 Stat. 2419 (1996) to see this play out. 204. 539 U.S. 558 (2003). 205. 576 U.S. 644 (2015).

    "abstract": "For the first time in nearly thirty years, in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the United States Supreme Court was asked, again, to overturn its landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade finding a constitutional right to an abortion. And with three new Trump appointees and a 6-3 conservative majority, it was finally able to do just that. The Court’s decision in Dobbs has called into question not just the safety of abortion but of other constitutional rights grounded in similar tradition and legal doctrine. This Note considers the effects that the Dobbs decision could have on LGBTQ+ rights in particular and proceeds in four parts. Part I analyzes the cultural similarities underlying the issues of abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Part II surveys the current Court’s attitude toward abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as its attitude toward the doctrine of stare decisis. Part III analyzes the analogous legal doctrines utilized by the majorities in landmark abortion and LGBTQ+ rights cases. Part IV considers the effects that the overruling of Roe could have on existing LGBTQ+ precedent today and suggests that—to the extent those precedents are put at risk—modern practitioners going before the Court should seek to actively decouple these issues in the eyes of the Justices",
