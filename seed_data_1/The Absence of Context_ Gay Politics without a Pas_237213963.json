Its volumes are scarcely stockedin large warehouse bookstores—and certainly not in the actual history sectionthat is dominated by books about war. Most U.S. history textbooks are deemedcomplete with a passing reference to Stonewall. Our own contemporary politicalmovement for LGBTQ rights and equality has shown little interest in or need forknowledge of our community’s history. Even feminist and queer academic spaceshave taken an anti-historical turn; fields that count significant numbers ofhistorians among their founders (such as women and gender studies or lesbianand gay studies) have become decidedly presentist. Just because the history of ourcommunities, identities, and organizations is marginalized, however, does notdiminish its significance.The fact that Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way” has become a gay anthem of sortsis not surprising. It affirms those who are being harassed by their families orreligion to “change” their sexual orientation or gender identity. Those over theage of forty can enjoy pop culture’s open embrace after decades of publicgay-bashing disguised as political discourse. Although many (but by no meansall) LGBTQ people believe they didn’t “choose” to be gay, our simplisticcelebration of this concept comes at a price. The idea of being “born this way”essentializes our often fraught and bumpy individual experiences of coming toterms with our sexual and/or gender identities while dehistoricizing queernessentirely. The concept actually eclipses the need for critical examination of gays asCopyright © 2014 Michigan State University.

It was, however, a perfect anthem for the same-sex marriagecampaign.The 2008 passage of Proposition 8 triggered collective outrage and fueled themost widespread national protests for gay rights since record numbers of peopletook to the streets to protest the violent murder of Matthew Shepard in 1998. Itmay seem like ancient history in the wake of the 2013U.S. Supreme Court rulingdeclaring the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, but the backlash repre-sented by the 2008 election-day passage of Proposition 8 overturning same-sexmarriage rights in California motivated a new generation of activists to advocatefor lesbian and gay equality and take to the streets. Immediately following thisevent, Join the Impact became the central organizing vehicle for nationwideprotests.1 At a rally in New Haven, Connecticut, over 300 people gathered andmarched. Nearly three dozen students from my campus, Connecticut College,woke up early that Saturday morning and drove to New Haven to join thenationwide effort. They brought handmade signs. One of them took over themicrophone and inspired the crowd with a brief speech before leading the chant,“Yes to Love.”Young people spoke with passion and anger, moved by the conviction thatfighting for the right of lesbians and gays tomarry is, as one of them toldme, “ourgeneration’s civil rightsmovement.” The focus on same-sexmarriage as the singlemost significant gay rights issue of our time and the shallow, polemical, andahistorical debates that framed it, however, signal not how far we have come butrather how systemic and powerful heteronormativity really is.This rally was a turning point for me as a queer feminist historian and activistwhowas ambivalent about the same-sexmarriagemovement, especially as it grewto overshadow other queer organizing. My involvement with student activistsfired up about same-sex marriage forced me to face the fact that I was disap-pointed, annoyed, and a little lost. How couldmy community be consumedwithsomething that I understood feminism and gay liberation to be against? Incertain political and scholarly circles, there was a feeling of anguish over thefading potency of feminism in public discourse and the increasing conformityand depoliticization of the gay community.The privileging of marriage has real consequences. It stigmatizes and threatensto further marginalize the most fabulous, polyamorous, free-loving, sex-loving,and gender-nonconforming segments of our community.2 Social stigma is onething—legal stigma yet another. Legalizing same-sex marriage rather than work-ing for legal rights to extend to a broader range of family, friends, and kin furtherreinforces discrimination against the unmarried. A 2004 survey by the U.S.General Accounting Office found 1,138 rights granted to married couples.3 Right116 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.now, marriage law perpetuates extensive institutional discrimination against theunmarried of all sexes, genders, and sexual orientations.When I said I was against same-sex marriage, my students looked at me as if Ihad three heads. But I came to this after two decades of reading and thinkingabout the history of women’s rights, gender roles, feminism, and patriarchy.Their total nonrecognition of my position required me to further understandand explain it myself. I am not technically opposed to same-sex couples beingafforded the same legal and social recognition as opposite-sex couples, of course.But as Judith Butler writes, “Politics . . . demands that we take a stand for oragainst same-sex marriage; but critical reflection, which is surely part of anyseriously normative political philosophy and practice, demands that we ask whyand how this has become the question.”4 And therein lay the source of myfrustration—my inability to understand how and why marriage rights came todefinemy community. I turned to important scholarship by historians and queerstudies scholars to help unpack this narrative, including work on homonorma-tivity and homonationalism as well as John D’Emilio’s powerful exposé of theconsequences of the marriage campaign’s numerous defeats.5Most conversations about same-sexmarriage in the national media completelyskip over this point: How and why have marriage rights become the question oflesbian and gay equality? Another way to answer this is to look back to the historyof the queer civil rights movement of the past fifty years.6 Rachel Maddow is oneof the few national figures to pursue this line of inquiry.7 Before interviewing thefamous cocounselors Ted Oslon and David Boies representing the plaintiffs inthe California case, Maddow provided just this context for her viewers, notingthat within the gay community in the 1990s, same-sex marriage was actually seenas themost conservative direction for themovement to go.8 Just this small nuggetof history provided invaluable historical and political context as an interestinglead-in to her story about the trial. Many of us who identified with the moreprogressive feminist wing of the movement are still surprised by this conservativeturn. An increasingly marginalized group of scholars and activists within theLGBTQ community stand against the same-sex marriage agenda for bothideological and practical reasons, including feminist or Marxist critiques of thegovernment regulation of private life and the belief that our activist money andenergywould be better spent addressing the needs of themostmarginalizedmembersof our community: transgender people, young people, the elderly, and thosesuffering from race and class oppression. Community engagement and mediacoverage of the same-sex marriage campaign has left little room for theseperspectives, though this is beginning to shift since the overturn of DOMA in2013.9The Absence of Context ) 117This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.Historians of the modern queer movement will one day mark the rise of themarriage campaign as a pivotal turning point for our communities whoseconsequences we cannot yet foresee. But the movement for same-sex marriagerights was not inevitable.Marriage is but one proposed solution to a particular setof indignities, many of which will persist for LGBTQ couples and individualseven if same-sex marriage is legalized in every state. History proves wrong theessentialist arguments that definemarriage as a “timeless” institution necessitatedby reproduction, religion, and biological determinism. Highlighting the historyof the institution of marriage to provide historical perspective on the currentnational debate is one important piece of the puzzle. This can be seen in work byNancy Cott, Peggy Pascoe, Stephanie Coontz, and George Chauncey, amongothers. As historians, however, we must connect the history of marriage to largersocial movements.This contemporary neglect of LGBTQmovement history is neither our legacynor our destiny. Some of the most provocative and visible grassroots efforts haveclaimed movement predecessors as their inspiration—and justification. Con-sider the manifesto written by Queer Nation in 1990 in response to the conser-vatism of national (and LGBTQ) politics. As Simon Hall has argued, QueerNation laid claim to the legacy of one of the movement’s early organizations—the New York Gay Liberation Front, which openly challenged racism, sexism,and imperialism. The Queer Nation manifesto stated, “Being queer is not abouta right to privacy; it is about the freedom to be public, to just be who we are. Itmeans everyday fighting oppression; homophobia, racism,misogyny, the bigotryof religious hypocrites and our own self-hatred.”10 The inability of an assimila-tionist strategy to bring about real structural change to American society wasobvious to both groups. But historical precedent could as likely inspire conser-vative approaches to activism as well. Think of the early public protests by theEastCoastHomophileOrganizations outside of IndependenceHall inPhiladelphia,known as the “Annual Reminder.” Marchers dressed in their gender-conformingSunday best in orderly and quiet procession to appeal to respectability, hoping toimpress passersby with the idea that lesbians and gay men were regular, non-threatening, and just like everyone else. The tension between radical intersec-tional organizing and conservative single-issue strategies are deeply wound intothe core of the movement’s history.11The absence of knowledge about this history has shaped a very presentist andcentrist analysis of the same-sex marriage movement. In organizing rallies,collecting signatures, raising money, and recruiting supporters, the idea ofstopping to read some history books and discuss the long-ago past might seemabsurd. And yet time and again, in conversation with experienced activists and118 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.young people alike, I couldn’t help but think how much knowledge of the pastwould enrich their organizing, coalition building, decision-making, and strategicthinking in the present. Our community desperately needed to be more engagedwith our histories—and historians.In January 2010, the newly invigorated same-sex marriage movement madehistory when it collided with the largest organization of professional historians.12The American Historical Association’s annual meeting was held in the Man-chester Grand Hyatt, a hotel that was being boycotted by the LGBTQ and laborcommunities in San Diego for its owner’s role in financing the movement forProposition 8 in addition to a number of workers-rights issues. A wide range ofgroups were behind the boycott including The San Diego LGBT Center, SanDiego Equality Campaign, Californians Against Hate, San Diego Alliance forMarriage Equality, Marriage Equality USA-San Diego, Sleep With the RightPeople-Southern California, Equality California, Courage Campaign, UNITEHERE International Union, and the San Diego County Labor Council. Thesegroups were committed to enforcing the boycott, which included not staying inthe hotel, patronizing the businesses inside, or even entering the building. Thegroups occasionally organized rallies outside and hosted one on Saturday after-noon during the AHA annual meeting, drawing the participation of a few dozenhistorians.13The AHA determined it would lose nearly $800,000 (a $611,000 cancellationfee and $180,000 in lost negotiated concessions)14 and potentially bankrupt theorganization if it relocated. The AHA decided to host a mini-conference withinthe conference on same-sex marriage to show it took the issue of discriminationagainst LGBTQ people seriously and would make space for people to engagescholarship on related topics.15 Still, the decision to keep the conference in a hotelowned by a prominent funder of anti-gay initiatives was devastating for manyLGBTQ historians, particularly those from California who lived through thevicious campaign. Craig Lofton described the political climate in Californialeading up to the Prop 8 vote, “It was a perpetual gay-bashing that lasted formonths, amplified by the media and bolstered by state authorities.” Hundreds ofanti-gay signs were illegally posted on public property near his home in LongBeach. Law enforcement and local government officials refused to have themremoved, despite their violation of election laws. Lofton wrote about the blitz ofhatred, “This is in addition to the hateful, vicious, mean-spirited, bigoted liesabout gay people being run constantly on TV ads and in quotes everyday in ournewspaper.” For Lofton and others, the criticism embedded in the campaignover same-sex marriage rights in California was both violent and personal; theAHA’s compromise plan—to issue statements disapproving of Manchester’sThe Absence of Context ) 119This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.bigotry while conducting business as usual—was not enough. Lofton wrote,“And now, despite the panels and pretense of happy resolution by the AHA . . .thousands of AHA members will be staying at that hotel, buying coffee andmuffins and bagels, buying their newspapers, etc. I cannot accept this. Thewounds from Prop 8 heal slowly. The AHA’s compromise is pragmatic butmorally unacceptable to me.”16 Many powerful and important voices of activistsand academics from near and far were absent from the panels and conversationsthat weekend because they chose to stand with integrity and conviction for theprincipal of justice and equality.Those of us in attendance were torn between our professional interests andresponsibilities, the desire to put our political convictions into practice, and thepersonal compulsion to stand up for our own dignity as queer people, the targetsof hatred and bigotry. Some historians attended the conference but stood insolidarity with the boycott, refusing to enter the Hyatt under any circumstances,even for panels, registration, business meetings, or the book exhibit. This was theposition adopted by then chair of the Committee on LGBT History, Ian Lekus.Although admiring the decision and conviction of both Ian and Craig, I chose toattend and participate for two reasons: First, local activists were not clear orconstructive in communicating with us in the year leading up to the meeting. Anumber of LGBTQ historians reached out to Cleve Jones, one of the chieforganizers, far in advance to discuss strategy. Marc Stein, member of the TaskForce on LGBTQHistorians, was one of several who received no response. Steinlater said, “Here there was a group of queer historians who wanted to ally withqueer labor to figure out how to deal with the situation, and our efforts were justignored until it was too late, pragmatically, to push for alternatives. And then wewere denounced publicly. I lost respect for Cleve Jones in that context.”17 I wasnot comfortable pulling out in protest when the details of the local developmentsand the terms of the boycott were so unclear. Second, as a board member of theCommittee on LGBTHistory at the time, I felt compelled to be present and helpnavigate the potential conflicts between local LGBTQ activists (my people) andprofessional historians in attendance (my colleagues). The Governing Board ofCommittee on LGBT History worked hard in the months prior to draft aposition statement for the meeting that we circulated to our membership as wellas to the leadership of the AHA. Queer historians were largely left in the darkabout the plans of local queer organizers while the AHA leadership made somequestionable decisions and ignored the best advice of both the Committee onLGBT History and the LGBTQ Historians Task Force.18The AHA decided to address the boycott of theManchester Hyatt by creatinga special mini-conference within the annual meeting on the history of same-sex120 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.marriage. This perspective served to highlight the different ways that marriagelaws have been used throughout history to sanctify some partnerships anddelegitimize others. Some historians complained that the mini-conference onsame-sex marriage was evidence of pandering to the gay agenda and giving gayhistory “special” consideration. But our treatment as LGBTQ historians was“special” for all the wrong reasons. The AHAmishandled the mini-conference inmany ways. They denied our request that the mini-conference sessions be movedout of the Hyatt so no one would have to violate the boycott to attend. This putthe entire set of special sessions out of reach of those who might most benefitfrom the knowledge—local activists fighting the discriminatory law and princi-pled LGBTQhistorians. The plaintiffs in Perry v. Schwarzenager, challenging theconstitutionality of Proposition 8 in federal court, knew that history was a greatweapon and called several historians of marriage to testify to the institution’sdynamic and changing dimensions. This great opportunity for creating a pow-erful conference was lost.The AHA ignored the organizing efforts of Committee on LGBT History,which issued an informative and thoughtful press release about the situationmonths in advance to help inform attendees of the situation. The AHA did notpass on our information, nor did they communicate in advance with meetingregistrants about the boycott or options available for changing their roomreservations. If you were not actively engaged in gay political activism, youmighthave no idea there was a boycott or a controversy. Even worse, at a late hour, theAHA sent an official communication out ONLY to those who were presentingon panels in the mini-conference, as if they were the only people who need bebothered. But worst of all, they employed a bizarre authoritarian approach toinformation and security at the conference itself. First, they had multiple guardsstationed in the rooms during mini-conference sessions. This was terrifying andbaffling. I have never felt so unsafe or nervous at an academic conference. Iwondered who decided this was the price we had to pay for sharing the history ofour community. I wondered who they were trying to protect from whom.Was Ito be protected or constrained? There were no answers, just guards and “talkingpoint” fact sheets for chairs to defend the organization against the potentialprotesters who never materialized. Why? Because they were boycotting thehotel!!!! All the security measures did was remind me how hostile the professionhas been to the field of LGBTQ history—and by extension, our communitiesand lives.One of the reasons that most people know very little about gay history is thatthe historical profession has been very slow to recognize LGBTQ history asimportant, relevant, or even legitimate. The groundbreaking collection of doc-The Absence of Context ) 121This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.uments in Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A. (1978) wascompiled by a self-taught researcher, JonathanNedKatz. JohnD’Emilio’s SexualPolitics Sexual Communities: The Making of a Homosexual Minority in the UnitedStates, 1940–1970 (1983) was a rare monograph penned by a professionalhistorian and published before 1990. Another founding father of the field,Martin Duberman, coedited (with Martha Vicinus and George Chauncey) theseminal Hidden from History: Reclaiming the Gay and Lesbian Past in 1990. Hismonograph Stonewall followed in 1993. The historical profession itself wasexplicitly hostile to serious analysis of lesbian and gay history for so long thatmany of the earliest works in the field were published by journalists and scholarstrained in other fields, chiefly literary criticism and anthropology.Odd Girls andTwilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America by LillianFaderman; Making History: The Struggle for Gay and Lesbian Equal Rights,1945–1990: An Oral History by Eric Marcus; Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold:The History of a Lesbian Community by Madeline Davis and Elizabeth Kennedy;and Esther Newton’s Cherry Grove, Fire Island: Sixty Years in America’s First Gayand Lesbian Town are a few examples.19The LGBTQ community has created many of our own archives, recognizingthat if we did not preserve the documents, lives, and histories of ourselves, that noone would. Major collections can be found in San Francisco, Los Angeles,Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York, but dozens of other cities, including SanDiego, have rich and diverse holdings as well. The LesbianHerstory Archives wasborn out of a lesbian-feminist consciousness-raising group in 1974 and made itshome in the apartment of Joan Nestle for nearly twenty years. The statement ofpurpose reflects the distrust they felt towards “patriarchal historians” whocontrolled the past: “The Lesbian Herstory Archives exists to gather and preserverecords of Lesbian lives and activities so that future generations will have readyaccess to materials relevant to their lives. The process of gathering this materialwill uncover and collect our herstory denied to us previously by patriarchalhistorians in the interests of the culture which they serve.”20 The ongoingcommitment to alphabetizing their library books by first name rather thansurname is a statement against patriarchal naming practices and reflects feministvalues popular in the 1970s.Community history projects have popped up across the country as well. TheBoston History Project was established in 1980 and notes the challenges ofpreserving community history in its mission statement, “Since the documenta-tion of the gay and lesbian experience is fragmentary and scattered, it hasremained largely inaccessible to researchers, educators, the general public, andeven the gay community itself. Through its mission, BHP seeks to provide an122 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.accurate portrayal of the contributions our community has made to the political,cultural and economic life of the region.”21 The GLBTHistorical Society of SanFrancisco was founded in 1980 and sponsors the GLBT History Museum, the“first full-scale, stand-alone museum of its kind” in the United States.22My ownlove of history was stoked in the 1990s in the one-room library/archives of thePhiladelphia gay community center then known as Penguin Place and run byvolunteer Steven Capsuto, now greatly expanded and named the John J.Wilcox,Jr. LGBT Archives in the William Way LGBT Community Center.23In the past twenty years, an increasing number of queer scholar/activists havebeen trained as professional historians and are documenting our past. Theexplosion of original monographs in LGBTQ history has coincided with theincreasing acceptance of LGBTQ studies as a legitimate field of scholarlyengagement and widespread student interest in sexuality studies. Some of theseworks include John Howard’s Men Like That, Marc Stein’s City of Sisterly andBrotherly Loves, Karen Krahulik’s Provincetown, Nan Boyd’s Wide Open Town,Marcia Gallo’s Different Daughters, David Johnson’s The Lavender Scare, andMartin Meeker’s Contacts Desired. More recent books include TransgenderHistory by Susan Stryker, Bohemian L.A. byDaniel Hurewitz, Pre-Gay L.A. by C.Todd White, Infectious Ideas by Jennifer Brier, Not in this Family by HeatherMurray, and Radical Relations by Daniel Winunwe Rivers.24 This list does notinclude the many books more properly categorized as histories of sexuality ratherthan LGBTQ community studies.This surge in publications has resulted in the creation of a “usable past”—abody of work in LGBTQmovement history, which is not, as some people say, anarrow subspecialty within twentieth-century U.S. political history. Rather,histories of the LGBTQmovement and our communitiesmore generally provideEXACTLY the kind depth and breadth of information one needs to develop anuanced understanding of one of the most hotly debated social and legal issues ofour day—the role and status of LGBTQ people in American society. Historianshave several important contributions to make to these contemporary debates—and people have much to learn from the study of LGBTQ history. Young peopleunderstand this. Years ago, I offered the first course in my history departmentexplicitly on LGBTQ history and it filled to capacity overnight. On our smallcampus, no more than a handful of students in the course openly identified asmembers of the LGBTQ community. Puzzled by student interest in the subject,over the course of the semester it became clear to me: For the past twentyyears—longer than some of them have been alive—the rights of LGBTQ peopleto live and work and love have been hotly contested in the national, state, andlocal political arenas. They want to know why. It is our job to teach them.The Absence of Context ) 123This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.The anti-gay right in this country has made it a common practice to reframecalls for an end to discrimination against LGBTQ people as a demand for“special rights” and aims to cultivate fear in others about how special rights for thegays will result in some kind of loss for themselves. Although evidence of thediscrimination, intimidation, and isolation faced by LGBTQ people in this countryhas been widely documented and is readily available in any number of media orscholarly sources for anyone to access, the rhetoric of “special rights” carries a greatdeal of weight in the popular imagination. In fact, LGBTQhistory is one of themostmarginalized specialties in the profession. Marc Stein, former chair of CLGBTH,documented this professional marginalization extensively in his 2001 report, whichwas published in Perspectives and can be accessed at the AHAWebsite.25Historians are a diverse and motley crew. Although the AHA’s OfficialStatement on Standards of Professional Conduct advocates a nondiscriminationpolicy that includes sexual orientation, this by no means signifies that all or evenmost historians support same-sex marriage or even LGBTQ civil rights moregenerally.26 Intellectual freedom in deciding what to teach in our courses issomething both prized and hotly contested in the profession. Each semester, aswe build our courses, we face the challenge of deciding what topics and texts areso important that we must include them. We debate with ourselves and ourcolleagues about the value in assigning “classic” and “seminal” works of historyverses the newest and most cutting edge studies that may not stand the test oftime. We struggle with defining what the “narrative” of our course will be—andwhich arguments and ideas we will use to disrupt it.This is one of the places where LGBTQ history gets lost. LGBTQ history—even for historians who are generally supportive of LGBTQ civil rights—becomes a “special” issue and if they make time or space for the “special” issue,some other beloved book or article or topic will be lost. Others might readLGBTQ history on their own but can’t justify dedicating an entire week of theirsyllabus to the study of a group of people that is so small—somarginal to history.Still others worry about the reception of students, the gaze of department chairsor tenure committees. These examples may capture only a few of the reasons whyhistorians neglect to teach LGBTQ history in their courses. My main point hereis to reframe this dynamic, just as gay activists continually reframe the narrativeof “special” rights to highlight the reality of our discrimination. Occasionalrecognition of a book, such as that enjoyed by George Chauncey’s seminal workGay New York, which was widely assigned in graduate seminars for years, signalstokenism and has not resulted in widespread reconceptualization of the period.27Any textbook or survey course in U.S. political, urban, women’s, or generalhistory that neglects the LGBTQ community is presenting historical fiction. In124 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.the newest edition of a widely taught thousand-page U.S. history textbook, Ifound that gay life and community was covered in less than one page. Oneparagraph covered the early part of the twentieth century and one paragraphcovered the modern gay rights movement. This minimal inclusion is progress—and for many young people, the only introduction to LGBTQ history they willever have. Historian Vickie Eaklor did an exhaustive study of the representationof LGBTQ history in U.S. history textbooks aimed at the college market.Although in 1991, she found only two of twenty-three books had more than oneshort paragraph on the subject, this dramatically improved in 2004. WhenEaklor redid this study, eleven of twenty-seven volumes earned an “A/A-“ in herevaluation system, which meant ”more detail on basics and/or more than1960s–90s and/ormore than two columns/one page.”28Although coverage of gaymen increased, chiefly through introduction of discussion about AIDS, repre-sentation of lesbians and transgender people was negligible. It should clear,however, that Eaklor set the bar rather low for these studies. One could easilymake the case that five-percent of each volume be dedicated to LGBTQ issues,based on a conservative estimate of our proportion of the population. By thisbarometer, fifty pages of a one thousand-page textbook would reasonably coverour lives. This absence is a pervasive and blatant form of systemic discrimination.But there is hope—and movement. A new U.S. history survey textbook, Explor-ing American Histories by Nancy Hewitt and Steve Lawson, contains a remark-able amount coverage including twelve distinct aspects of our history, thoughstill nowhere near five-percent of the volume.29Widespread ignorance about the history and diversity of LGBTQ people andcommunities still stands as a significant obstacle in the movement for freedomand equality. The popular and timely historical website, History News Network,uses the tag line, “Because the Past, is the Present, and the Future too.”We knowall too well that the denial and silencing of our past serves to marginalize andoppress us in the present. Although anti-gay right wing forces may actively workto deny the availability of such information, even those who support and defendthe dignity of gay people, even liberals, and even our allies fall prey to thisinsidious form of homophobia. Former Committee on LGBT History chairKaren Krahulik recently noted how otherwise educated and informed peopleknow little about LGBTQ history. “It is unheard of,” she remarked, “for an issueto be so hotly contested in American politics without a corresponding rush tolearn about its history.”30 This marginalization of LGBTQ history within thehistorical profession, however, is out of step with student interest in the subject.Many of us teaching courses in the history of sexuality or LGBTQ history reportthem being filled year after year, at both the graduate and undergraduate level.The Absence of Context ) 125This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.We must continue to teach these courses regularly and work to make themmainstays of history department curriculum in schools large and small.The erasure of LGBTQ experience from most of history, the resistance ofteachers and professors to teaching our history, and the widespread belief that thehistories of our lives and communities are minor, marginal, and irrelevant to thestory of U.S. history are blatant acts of hostility and oppression. As instructors ofU.S. history at diverse institutions across the country and even around the world,we are poised to change that. When I was an undergraduate history major, Ilooked to social justice movements of the past to better understand the culturewars of the 1990s. Historical studies about the women’s movements and theAfrican-American civil rights movement were readily available and provided mewith a much deeper understanding of the issues, positions, and people involvedin national debates over welfare, abortion, prisons, and immigration. It inspiredin me a love of the past, not as a static record of events but as a livingdocumentation of experiences and struggles which continued to shape peoples’lives—including my own—in the present.The fight for same-sex marriage rights rages on, though less urgently for thoseof us living in states where it has been legalized. Standing with hundreds ofmostly young people in New Haven that day did not assuage my own ambiva-lence about same-sex marriage. Although inspired by their enthusiasm andconviction, I wondered why they weren’t as passionate about fighting fortransgender rights, employment nondiscrimination laws, or against the physicaland rhetorical violence so many of us face every day. I couldn’t help but wonderwhat they would think of the marriage movement if they studied the activism ofMattachine Society or Daughters of Bilitis; if they studied the sexual revolutionthat gave rise to both women’s and gay liberation.I wonder if Barney Frank and the legions of gay assistants, activists, andlobbyists who decided to exclude transgender people from Employment Non-Discrimination Act would have made the same decision if they really studied thehistory of the Stonewall Riots or watched Susan Stryker’s path-breaking docu-mentary, Screaming Queens: The Riot at Comptons Cafeteria. I wish our commu-nity really reflected on the major role transgender and working-class peopleplayed in some of our movement’s most important moments. I wonder if theeditors of the Advocate who ran the cover story “Gay is the New Black” mighthave thought differently if they read about the vibrant African-American com-munities featured in George Chauncey’s Gay New York. These are just a fewexamples of how knowledge of the past might inform a more thoughtful,inclusive, and even radical present. Thankfully, it’s not too late to do something.126 ( Jen ManionThis work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.Academics and activists alike can do much to challenge widespread ignoranceof the LGBTQ past. For those teaching college right now, it is very easy.Knowledge is power. Teaching LGBTQ history in your classes does not makeyou a gay activist. Recognizing LGBTQhistory as central to the narrative of U.S.history rather than marginal, incorporating it into courses in a thoughtful way,committing yourself to reading at least one new LGBTQ history monographeach year, supporting junior colleagues who teach LGBTQ content, and takingjob candidates with LGBTQ themed dissertations seriously as general scholarsare all powerful steps you can take to stand against the longstanding marginal-ization and suppression of the gay past. High-school and middle-school teachersgenerally have greater constraints than college faculty but have much to offer ifthey can incorporate LGBTQ history into their courses and class projects. Ourstudents are ready. So start now, insuring that future generations will have theinformation they need to make sense of struggles of their times.LGBTQ history is an easy way to do important work that engages students,scholars, and activists. On my campus, I coordinated a “Know Your Hirstory”campaign. Given the use of “hir” as a gender neutral pronoun in the transgendercommunity, the “hirstory” campaign is meant to be decidedly trans inclusivewhile also spinning off of traditional “history” and lesbian/feminist calls for“herstory.”We called it “a gender inclusive study of the past.” The first project ofthis campaign was done in conjunction with the college library and involved twocomponents: a display of favorite LGBTQ themed books by faculty, staff, andstudent leaders on campus along with profiles of those people and a list of theirrecommendations.31 The second component was a banner and bookmark meantto draw attention to the campaign and give people something to take away withthem. Working with a student design team, we came up with graphics that useda black background, white lettering, and pink triangles to teach about the historyof Nazi persecution of gays during the Holocaust as well as how ACT UPappropriated the symbol for their activism. The campaign worked—students,faculty, and staff are hungry for more.As with the first generation of LGBTQ historians, the activist community is notsitting around waiting for academics to create a usable past. The internet, digitaltechnologies, and social media have all made this easier as artists, writers, activists,archivists, public intellectuals, and historians have created a virtual explosion of queerhistory in the recent past. A notable but not exhaustive list of these projects includes:The ACT UP Oral History Project, which offers video text of interviews withmembers of ACT UP New York, who were on the front lines in the fight againstwidespread public and government indifference to theHIV/AIDS crisis.Gay historypioneer Jonathan Ned Katz founded OUT history to be the “go to” place for queerThe Absence of Context ) 127This work originally appeared in QED: A Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, 1.2, Summer 2014, published by Michigan State University Press.history online.32 The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History has taken the creativequeer community by storm in expanding the notion of historical subjects andrepresentations.33 The Queer Newark Oral History Project is community basedand directed.34 These projects are just the tip of the iceberg.More andmoremainstreammuseums, libraries, and archives are curating exhibitsin LGBTQhistory as well. Two examples on opposite sides of the country had theiropening nights on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2014. TheMuseum ofHistory andIndustry in Seattle, Washington, hosted an exhibit called “Revealing Queer” toexplore how the community has “grown, changed, becomemore visible, andworkedtoward equality” in the Puget Sound region.35 The Library Company of Philadel-phia—America’s first lending library, which was founded by Benjamin Frank-lin—curated an exhibit from its vast collection called “That’s So Gay: OutingEarly America” and features an online component as well.36History can also seem like a safe way for others to learn about our community.My own current research project on transgender histories of the eighteenth andnineteenth centuries is an accessible way for people to think critically about thegender binary, crossing, passing, binding, language, and pronouns. It engages anumber of issues pressing to the transgender community today and allows peopleto learn about these issues without burdening individual transgender people withtheir questions.37 Just because learning this way seems safe to those new to ourcommunities does not make its impact any less powerful.The widespread ignorance about the history and diversity of LGBTQ peoplestands as the single most significant obstacle to our liberation, justice, andequality. Although anti-gay right wing forces actively work to suppress suchinformation, even those who support and defend the dignity of LGBTQ people(even liberals) fall prey to this insidious form of homophobia and transphobia.LGBTQ history is one powerful tool to use as we try to shift the terms of publicdiscourse, incorporating lessons from the past so we may move beyond ourhistoric limitations in imagining a queer future worth living.NOTES1.
