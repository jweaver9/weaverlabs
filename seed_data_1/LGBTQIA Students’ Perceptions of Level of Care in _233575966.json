In this study, 48 LGBTQIA students completed a survey \nto ascertain their perceptions on whether or not the college counseling center was a safe place to \ndiscuss issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity.  Results showed that LGBTQIA \ndid believe the counseling center was a safe place to discuss issues related to sexual orientation \nand gender identity but also identified that additional resources and counselor education on \nLGBTQIA issues could be help improve the LGBTQIA students’ perception of level of care at \nthe counseling center. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 3 \nLiterature Review \nIndividuals who have a sexual or gender minority status are at an elevated risk for mental \nhealth issues (Cochran & Mays, 2009; Mental Health America, 2016; Sabin, Riskind, & Nosek, \n2015; Sherriff, Hamilton, Wigmore, & Giambrone, 2011).  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, \nqueer or questioning, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) individuals are particularly vulnerable to \nincreased rates of mental health issues (Kelleher, 2009; MHA, 2016; Moe, Finnerty, Sparkman, \n& Yates, 2015; Sherriff et al., 2011).  Mental health issues include substance use, suicide, \ninterpersonal violence, and mental disorders including depression and anxiety (Kelleher, 2009; \nMHA, 2016; Moe, Finnerty, Sparkman, & Yates, 2015; Sherriff et al., 2011).  LGBTQIA \nindividuals seek mental health treatment at higher rates than Non-LGBTQIA individuals; \ntherefore, it is important that mental health professionals are informed of effective ways to work \nwith this population of people (Bieschke, McClanahan, Tozer, Grzegorek, & Park, 2000; \nBurckell & Goldfried, 2006; Panchankis & Goldfried, 2004).  \nWhen researching the prevalence of mental health issues and the percentage of \nLGBTQIA individuals who seek mental health treatment, in relation to college students, this \nwriter was not able to find adequate research.  There is a gap in the research about the counseling \nexperiences of LGBTQIA people and whether or not they feel comfortable discussing issues \nrelated to their sexual orientations or gender identities at college counseling centers.  Due to \nlimited research on this topic, this literature review will include information on LGBTQIA \nindividuals from various settings, geographical locations, and age ranges. When discussing the \nstudies used for this literature review, it is important to note that some groups of individuals \ncomprising the LGBTQIA population have been studied more than others.  For example, \nresearch is lacking in regards to the clinical issues and mental health needs of intersex (Jones, \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 4 \n2016; Leidolf, Curran, Bradford, & Bradford, 2008) and asexual individuals (Carrigan, 2011; \nMacInnis & Hodson, 2012; Pinto, 2014) so there may be sections of the literature review where \nthese populations have limited research presented.  Much of the past research has focused on \ncounselors’ perceptions of being prepared to work with LGBTQIA clients and not the experience \nof LGBTQIA individuals.  This writer believes it is important to examine the experience of the \nclients to make sure their needs are being met.    \nThe studies in this literature review focus on helping professionals from multiple \ndisciplines, including mental health counselors, social workers, and psychologists.  The various \nstudies discuss clinical issues specifically related to LGBTQIA individuals and identify effective \ntreatment strategies for working with LGBTQIA individuals.   This literature review will provide \nbackground information which will help anchor my research questions. The literature review will \nbegin by examining the prevalence and development of mental health issues for LGBTQIA \nindividuals, the historical treatment of this population, and helping professionals’ education of \nLGBTQIA issues. Next, the current standard of care for working with LGBTQIA individuals \nwill be discussed before a discussion of treatment strategies that have been found effective for \nworking with this population.  \nTerminology and Fluidity of LGBTQIA \nLGBTQIA is a blanket term used to describe the individual groups that compose the \ncollective population of people.  The different groups represent diverse people, and this writer \nrecognizes that the needs and issues facing each of these groups can be diverse. This writer also \nacknowledges that LGBTQIA does not thoroughly cover all sexual and gender identities. \n Throughout this paper, variations of LGBTQIA (LG, LGB, GLB, LGBA, LGBT, LGBTQ) will \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 5 \nbe used to represent the particular population being represented in specific research articles that \nwere reviewed.   \n    To ensure understanding of the terms in this paper, terms that will be used throughout the \npaper will be defined.  Sexual orientation/identity refers to the sex that people are emotionally, \nphysically, and intimately attracted to (American Psychological Association, 2012).  Gender \nidentity refers to one’s sense of self as male, female, or transgender (APA, 2012). Goodrich and \nLuke (2015) provided definitions of different sexual orientations and gender identities that will \nbe used throughout this paper.  Lesbians (L) are women who are emotionally, physically, and \nintimately attracted to other women; Gay (G) men are men who are emotionally, physically, and \nintimately attracted to other men; and Bisexuals (B) are men or women who are emotionally, \nphysically, and intimately attracted to both men and women (Goodrich & Luke, 2015).   \nTransgender (T) individuals are people whose gender identities do not match the sex they \nwere assigned at birth; and Questioning (Q) individuals are exploring their sexual orientation and \nmay be unsure or questioning the label that best fits their sexual orientation (Goodrich & Luke, \n2015).  Goodrich and Luke (2015) define Queer (Q) individuals as individuals who may not want \nto describe themselves using the aforementioned sexual orientation labels; Intersex (I) \nindividuals as individuals who are born with the reproductive organs and sexual anatomy that \ndoes not fit typical definitions of male or female; and Asexual (A) individuals as individuals who \nlack sexual attraction or interest in sex.  Now that terminology that will be used throughout the \npaper has been defined, the following section will discuss some of the specific mental health \nissues of LGBTQIA individuals. \nMental Health Issues of LGBTQIA Individuals \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 6 \nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI, 2015) reported that LGBTQ individuals \nare three times more likely than others to experience mental health issues.  According to NAMI \n(2015) and Mental Health America (MHA, 2016), an estimated 20-30% of LGBTQ individuals \nuse substances, and 25% of LGBT individuals use alcohol, compared to 9% and 5-10% of the \ngeneral population.  LGBT youth are four times as likely to attempt suicide, experience suicidal \nthoughts, and engage in self-harm when compared to heterosexual youth (MHA, 2016).  Thirty-\neight to sixty-five percent of transgender individuals are reported to experience suicidal ideation \n(MHA, 2016).  Depression, low self-esteem, and substance use are disproportionately high for \nthe Transgender population when compared to other groups in the LGBTQIA population \n(O’Hara, Dispenza, Brack, & Blood, 2013).  When looking at these statistics, it is important also \nto consider that many individuals may not openly identify as being an LGBTQIA individual, \nwhich means these numbers are most likely an underrepresentation for this population. \nMental Health of College Students \n    According to Wright and McKinley (2011), LGBT college students are at a greater risk to \nexperience harassment, violence, homophobia, intolerance, discrimination, and marginalization \nbecause of their sexual orientation and gender identities when compared to Non-LGBT students. \n Rankin (2003) conducted a study of 14 college campuses and found that 36% of the \nundergraduate students who participated in the study had experienced harassment within the past \nyear, 38% had been pressured to hide their sexual orientation or gender identity, 20% were \nconcerned for their personal safety, and 51% chose to suppress their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity to avoid any perceived persecution.  The mental health of LGBT students can be \nnegatively impacted by the treatment they receive on campus and can result in academic \nunderachievement and low campus participation (Wright & McKinley, 2011).  Lennon and \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 7 \nMistler (2010) stated that transgender students often feel less connected to campus culture and \nare more likely not to graduate when compared to Non-Transgender students.  Jones (2016) \nconducted a study to research the needs of intersex students and found that 42% of the \nparticipants who responded reported they had thought about self-harm, 26% had engaged in self-\nharming behaviors, 60% had thought about suicide, and 19% had attempted suicide based on \nissues related to their experiences of being an intersex individual.  With high rates of mental \nhealth issues for this population, it is necessary to explore the development and origin of many of \nthese mental health issues. \nDevelopment of Mental Health Issues  \nThe Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2016) posited that LGBT \nindividuals experience mental health difficulties as a result of societal stigma, discrimination, \nand denial of human rights.  Discrimination of LGBTQ individuals has also been linked to \nLGBTQ individuals isolating themselves from friends, family, and community services (Sherriff \net al., 2011).  Isarael, Gorcheva, Burnes, and Walther (2008) suggested that experiences of social \nstigma and discrimination, deficits in social support, and experiences of heterosexism contribute \nto increased rates of psychological problems in sexual minority individuals.  Meyer (2003) \nposited that LGBT individuals experience high levels of minority stress as a result of experiences \nof prejudice, expectations of rejection, the need for concealing their identities, and internalized \nhomophobia.  Kelleher’s (2009) study also supported the concept that minority stressors were \nshown to significantly predict negative mental health outcomes for LGBTQ individuals.   \nCochran and Mays (2009) found evidence that high levels of sexual minority related \nstigma were associated with increased risks for distress, depression, and anxiety disorders. \n Victor and Nel (2016) conducted a study of sexual minority individuals’ experiences of \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 8 \ncounseling and reported that, internationally, there is a consensus that prejudice and \ndiscrimination have adverse effects on LGB individuals.  In addition to the issues previously \ndiscussed, Victor and Nel (2016) state that LGB individuals may experience fragmented \nidentities, living a double life, social isolation, rejection, powerlessness, and violence.  Gender, \nrace, socioeconomic status, employment status, education level, and familial resistance may also \nhave negative impacts on mental health and should be considered when working with LGB \nindividuals (Victor & Nel, 2016).        \nO’Hara et al. (2013) suggested transgender individuals face numerous challenges of \noppression, invisibility, lack of legal protection, and confusion regarding transgender identities, \nwhich can lead to high rates of mental health issues.  Jones’ (2016) study of intersex individuals \nfound that 34% of the participants who responded reported having overall negative experiences \nof their education.  Forty-three percent of the respondents reported having been bullied during \ntheir educational experiences based on being an intersex individual.  Bullying varied from verbal \nassault to physical violence by both students and staff.  Leidolf et al.’s. (2008) study of mental \nhealth and support systems for intersex individuals found that as intersex children matured they \nwere likely to experience psychological stress due to confusion about their gender identities, \nemotional distress from the medical treatments they experienced, and lack of disclosure the \nindividuals received from their parents in regards to being an intersex individual.   \nIntersex individuals may also experience mental health issues related to the medical \ncondition of being intersex.  Slijper, Drop, Molenaar, & Sabine (1998) conducted a study on the \nlong-term psychological evaluations of intersex children and found that 39% of the 59 \nparticipants experienced psychological distress despite having sex reassignment surgeries.  This \nstudy suggested that issues related to one’s gender identity can have negative impacts on the \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 9 \nmental health of the individual and discussed how sex reassignment surgery does not always \nalleviate mental health issues related to gender role behavior.  Slijper et al.’s. (1998) study \nsuggested that early counseling appeared to have a positive effect on decreasing mental health \nissues for intersex individuals.   \nAsexuality is the most under-researched and misunderstood sexual minority populations \n(Carrigan, 2011; Pinto, 2014).  Although there are few statistics available on the prevalence of \nmental health issues for asexual individuals, research has helped shed light on issues commonly \nfaced by asexual individuals.  Stigma, mockery, and harassment about being an asexual \nindividual are issues faced by this population by both dominant and other sexual minority \npopulations (MacInnis & Hodson, 2012).   MacInnis and Hodson (2012) conducted a study that \nfound that asexual individuals were more likely to experience prejudice than other sexual \nminority populations, especially when considering the bias and prejudice between members of \nthe LGBQA population.  Pinto (2014) identified stress related to identity development of asexual \nindividuals as being a factor related to mental health issues for this population.  Research \nsuggests that one in 10 persons who identify as asexual will experience identity-related issues \nwhich will effect their mental health (Pinto, 2014).   \nThe chronic stress experienced by sexual and gender minority individuals may be linked \nto higher rates of mental health services utilization when compared to sexual and gender majority \nindividuals (Bieschke, McClanahan, Tozer, Grzegorek, & Park, 2000; Burckell & Goldfried, \n2006; Panchankis & Goldfried, 2004).  Researchers Grella, Cochran, Greenwell, and Mays \n(2011) found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals were twice as likely to seek mental \nhealth treatment compared to their heterosexual counterparts.  The researchers collected data on \n2,074 individuals and found that 48.5% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual participants reported \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 10 \nreceiving treatment in the past twelve months compared to 22.5% of heterosexual participants \n(Grella et al., 2009).   \nSexual and gender minority individuals may be resistant to seeking mental health services \nbecause of past experiences of discrimination and stigmatization from medical and mental health \nsystems.  When working with LGBTQIA individuals, it is important to be cognizant of the \nhistorical treatment of this population.  Counselors are in a unique position to serve as allies and \nadvocates to the LGBTQ population by providing culturally sensitive services when working \nwith LGBTQ clients (Troutman & Packer-Williams, 2014).      \nHistorical Treatment of LGBTQIA Individuals \n    LGB individuals have been historically subjected to inadequate and psychologically \nharmful mental health treatment (Burckell & Goldfried, 2006).  It was not until 1973 that \nhomosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \n(DSM) as a mental health disorder (Bennett & Douglas, 2013; Johnson, 2012).  Shidlo and \nSchroeder (2002) conducted a study of 202 sexual minority individuals and concluded that the \nvast majority of individuals reported lasting harm from the therapy, including increased negative \nperceptions of homosexuality and depressed moods.  Asexuality has historically been viewed as \na pathological symptom or a pathology itself (MacInnis & Hodson, 2012), and is still in the \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychological Association, \n2013) as a mental health disorder for men and women (Pinto 2014).  Although asexuality is more \noperationalized as a category of sexual orientation within the normal range of sexual functioning \n(MacInnis & Hodson, 2012), it is still important for mental health professionals to remember that \nnot all instances of a lack of sexual desire or sexual contact are related to pathology (Pinto, \n2014).   \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 11 \nIndividuals struggling with gender identity issues have also experienced negative \nexperiences with the medical and mental health professions.  Transgender individuals have \nexperienced misunderstanding, mistreatment, and marginalization from mental health \nprofessionals (O’Hara et al., 2013).  O’Hara et al. (2013) reported that many mental health \ntextbooks, diagnostic assessments, research perspectives, and counseling interventions still \nconsider transgender individuals to be mentally ill or pathological.  Medical and mental health \nprofessionals have typically been viewed as gatekeepers and regulators of the gender transition \nprocess, which has caused some distrust and suspicion from transgender individuals because \nbeing transgender has been historically pathologized (Carrol, Gilroy, & Ryan, 2002).  Being \nintersex has historically been addressed from more of a medical perspective than a mental health \nperspective, which results in many intersex individuals not receiving adequate mental health \ntreatment (Leidolf et al., 2008).  Leidolf et al.’s. (2008) conducted a study of pediatric medical \nprograms that provide support for intersex individuals and found that 69% of the programs in the \nstudy offered mental health support, but only 19% of the families received support during the \ndiagnosis, and only 15% of the intersex patients received support after diagnosis.      \n    Although social changes have led to increased acceptance of LGBTQIA individuals (Moe \net al., 2015), the stigma associated with being an LGBTQIA person may still prevent some \nindividuals from disclosing their sexual orientations or gender identities to their mental health \nproviders (Sabin, Riskind, & Nosek, 2015; Jones, 2016).  Sherriff et al. (2011), suggest that \nLGBTQ individuals may fail to access mental health services because of negative experiences of \ndiscrimination from mental health professionals in the past.  In addition to the historical negative \ntreatment of LGBTQIA individuals, research has also suggested that mental health professionals \nmay not always feel adequately prepared to deal with issues related to sexual orientation and \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 12 \ngender identity (Jones, 2016; O’Hara et al., 2013; Owen-Pugh & Baines, 2014; Sherriff et al., \n2011, Troutman & Packer-Williams, 2014), which can hinder the treatment of this population.   \nHelping Professionals’ Education on LGBTQIA Issues \nHistorically, most behavioral health graduate level programs have not included a \ncomprehensive curriculum of educational information on LGBT issues (Johnson, 2012; Owen-\nPugh & Baines, 2014; Walker & Prince, 2010). Burckell and Goldfried (2006) investigated \ntherapist qualities preferred by sexual minority individuals.  They found that a significant portion \nof the mental health professionals in the study, reported that their graduate training programs did \nnot educate them about sexual minority issues and stated that they often feel unprepared to work \nwith sexual minority clients.   \nAlessi (2013) referenced a study on LGBT issues in social work and reported that only \n41% of the social work program directors thought their programs trained students “slightly well” \nto “not at all well” about working competently with LGBT individuals.  Comparable data to \nCounselor Education Programs was not found in the research.  However, a study done by Owen-\nPugh and Baines (2014) suggested that time constraints on counselor training programs may \nrequire the programs to discuss issues of diversity in more general terms rather than focusing on \nspecific groups.    \nSince the 1970’s the treatment of LGB individuals has significantly increased, but there is \nstill little empirical research on what constitutes effective psychotherapy when working with \nLGB individuals (Johnson, 2012).  Although issues related to gender identity are becoming more \npublicized, there is little educational research and training guidelines to address working with \ntransgender Carroll et al., 2002), intersex (Jones, 2016; Leidolf et al., 2008), and asexual \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 13 \nindividuals (Pinto, 2014).  The following section will discuss the current standard of care and \ncounselor competencies that are expected when working with LGBTQIA individuals.   \nCurrent Standard of Care \nAccording to the American Psychological Association Task Force (2009), the current \nstandard of care when working with gender and sexually diverse clients are to adopt an open and \naffirming approach.  Implementation of the standard of care mentioned above is practiced and \nsupported by creating safe and affirming environments where sexual and gender minority clients \ncan explore their gender and diverse sexuality needs (Moe et al., 2015).    \nAn Affirmative Approach to Counseling \nAn affirmative approach to working with sexual minority clients assumes that LGB \nindividuals have the internal resources to handle their problems and postulates that it is important \nfor clinicians to acknowledge the influence society, discrimination, and significant others have \non LGB individuals (Victor & Nel, 2016).  For sexual minority individuals, an affirmative \napproach recognizes and seeks to understand the effects discrimination, rejection, concealment \nof identity, and internalized homophobia have had on the individual’s development (Meyer, \n2003).  When working with an LGB individual from an affirmative approach, the mental health \nprofessional should encourage clients to establish a support system, help clients become aware of \nhow oppression has affected them, desensitize the shame and guilt around being an LGB \nindividual, and allow clients to express their anger in response to being oppressed (Pachankis & \nGoldfried, 2013).  Lebolt’s (1999) phenomenological study confirmed that an affirmative \napproach to counseling sexual minority clients helps counteract societal influences of \nhomophobia on an individual’s development as well as provides a way of healing familial and \nsocietal wounds and developing a stronger sense of self.   \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 14 \nAn affirming approach with transgender clients has been found to alleviate the shame, \nisolation, and secrecy that occur when a person tries to pass for the desired gender (Carrol, \nGilroy, & Ryan, 2002).  A trans-affirmative approach to counseling affirms transgender persons, \neducates others on transgender issues, and advocates for political, social, and economic rights of \nthis population (Carrol et al., 2002).  Carrol et al. (2002) believe that it is essential that helping \nprofessionals have adequate knowledge about local, regional, and national support networks so \nthat they can connect transgender clients with a support network.  Israel et al. (2008), state that \nsafe access to qualified, competent, and affirming counselors is a major factor in meeting the \nwellness, developmental, and mental health needs of sexual and gender minority clients.   \nCounselor Competencies \nMultiple disciplines of helping professionals have created guidelines and competencies \nfor mental health counselors, social workers, and psychologists to follow when working with \nLGBTQIA individuals.  The Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues in \nCounseling (ALGBTIC), an American Counseling Association (ACA) division, has created a set \nof competencies for working with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, and \nAlly Individuals (Association for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Issues in Counseling, \n2013) as well as a set of competencies for working with Transgender individuals (American \nCounseling Association, 2010).   The American Psychological Association (2012) also created \nguidelines for psychological practice with Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual clients to help provide a \nframework for the treatment of LGB individuals receiving mental health treatment from \npsychologists. \nALGBTIC created a set of competencies to help counseling professionals to create safe, \nsupportive, and caring relationships with LGBQIQA clients, groups, and members of the \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 15 \ncommunity (ALGBTIC LGBQQIA Competencies Taskforce, 2013).  The goal of the set of \ncompetencies is to help LGBQIQA clients, groups, and communities to foster self-acceptance as \nwell as increase personal, social, emotional, and relational development (ALGBTIC LGBQQIA \nCompetencies Taskforce, 2013).  The American Counseling Association published a set of \ncompetencies for professional counselors to abide by when working with transgender \nindividuals.  Similar to the competencies for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Queer, Questioning, \nIntersex, and Ally Individuals, this set of competencies is based on a wellness, resilience, and \nstrength based approach (ACA, 2010).  The American Psychological Association developed a set \nof guidelines to help guide psychologists when working with sexual minority clients.  The set of \nguidelines provides a frame of reference for the treatment of sexual minority individuals as well \nessential information in the areas of assessment, intervention, identity, relationships, diversity, \neducation, training, and research (APA, 2012).  Each guideline provides the rationale behind the \nguideline as well as how psychologists can apply the guideline to their practices.   \nThe three sets of competencies and guidelines just discussed aim to help improve the \neffectiveness of mental health professionals working with the LGBQTIA population.  The \ncompetencies strive to increase mental health professionals’ self-awareness of biases and how \nthose biases may affect the work the professional does with an LGBTQIA client.  The \ncompetencies also increase knowledge of issues faced by LGBTQIA individuals and how those \nissues may be affecting the clients being served.   \nIdentity Development Issues in LGBTQIA Individuals \nMany issues LGBTQIA clients present in counseling will be similar to Non-LGBTQIA \nclients; however, there are some issues that are unique to being part of a minority population. \nBeing knowledgeable about a sexual or gender minority individual’s identity development will \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 16 \nhelp clinicians better understand the LGBTQIA individual’s experience and how their \ndevelopment may be influencing the individual’s presenting issues.   \nPachankis and Goldfried (2013) describe identity development as the sexual minority \nindividual’s process of acquiring an LGB identity and the additional lifelong efforts required to \nmaintain a positive identity as a sexual minority individual.  No matter what stage of identity \ndevelopment the individual is in, it is unique to the individual, and each may experience the stage \ndifferently (Johnson, 2013).  Lev (2007) reminds mental health professionals that it is important \nfor the individual’s experience to be normalized as the individual becomes aware and \nacknowledges their sexual or gender identities.  When working with transgender individuals, it is \nimportant to remember that the gender identity of the individual does not match their assigned \nbirth gender and the individual may not conform to the binary classification of male and female \n(Lennon & Mistler, 2010).   \nAllowing the client to label their sexual or gender identities can help prevent mental \nhealth professionals from inappropriately labeling the individual and allow for disclosure when \nthe person is ready (Moe et al., 2015).  Empowering LGBTQIA individuals to navigate their \ndisclosures of identity development is considered a best practice in counseling (ALGBTIC, \n2010).  Deciding whether or not to disclose their sexual or gender identities and with whom is an \nimportant decision for LGBTQIA individuals. It is important for mental health professionals to \nhelp their clients to assess who the client feels safe disclosing to and when is the appropriate time \n(Pachankis & Goldfried, 2013). \nCounselor awareness of issues related to identity development can help counselors to \nprovide affirmative counseling when working with LGBTQIA individuals.  In addition to \ncounselor knowledge about LGBTQIA specific issues, research has shown that there are certain \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 17 \ncharacteristics of the counselor and therapeutic relationship that help create a safe environment \nfor LGBTQIA individuals to discuss issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in \ncounseling.                               \nCounselor and Therapeutic Relationship Characteristics \nStudies have shown that counselor characteristics and factors related to the therapeutic \nrelationship have a strong impact on the level of satisfaction LGBTIQA individuals experience \nin counseling (Bennett & Douglas, 2013; Burckell & Goldfried, 2006; Camarena & Rutter, 2015; \nIsrael et al., 2008; Lebolt, 1999; Victor & Nel, 2016).  Lebolt (1999) conducted a \nphenomenological study that identified personal and professional characteristics of therapists that \nled to affirmative counseling of LGB individuals.  Personal qualities of the therapist that led to \npositive experiences of LGB clients included, the therapist being authentic, comfortable with \nthemselves, kind, sensitive, concerned, and friendly (Lebolt, 1999).  Professional qualities of the \ntherapist include the therapist being nonjudgmental, open, accepting, curious, emotionally \nsupportive, and validating of the LGB individual’s experiences (Lebolt, 1999).  In regards to \nspecific issues faced by LGB individuals, Lebolt (1999) identified several things therapists did \nthat LGB individuals found helpful in the counseling relationship.  Counselors who were \naccepting of the LGB person, who affirmed the individual’s need for non-heterosexual \nrelationships, who appeared comfortable with sexuality in general, who normalized the \nindividual’s experiences, and who facilitated the individual’s coming out process were found to \nbe desired by LGB individuals (Lebolt, 1999).   \nVictor and Nel (2016) conducted in-depth interviews with 15 LGB individuals and \nidentified factors that led to either positive or negative experiences in counseling.  Positive \nexperiences in counseling were attributed to both counselor qualities and affirmation of the \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 18 \nindividual’s sexual orientation.  Positive qualities of the counselor included total acceptance \nfrom the counselor, the counselor being non-judgmental, the counselor being a good listener, and \nthe counselor providing unconditional positive regard for the client (Victor & Nel, 2016).  In \nrelation to the counselor’s affirmation of the individual's sexual orientation, positive experiences \nof the client were represented when counselors normalized same-sex attractions, feelings, and \nbehaviors; when counselors addressed internalized homophobia; when counselors accepted a \ncurious stance; and when counselors accepted sexual orientation as only one aspect of the \ntherapeutic experience (Victor & Nel, 2016).   \nNegative experiences with counseling were attributed to times when counselors viewed \nthe client’s sexual orientation as abnormal; viewed sexual orientation as a dichotomy rather than \naffirming the fluidity of sexuality; supported heterosexist and myths about LGB individuals; \nfailed to realize that LGB youth face different developmental issues that Non-LGB youth; and \nviewed the individual’s presenting issues as always being related to the individual’s sexual \norientation (Victor & Nel, 2016).   \nIsrael et al. (2008) conducted a study to identify helpful and unhelpful therapy \nexperiences of LGBT individuals and reported qualities of the therapeutic relationship and \ntherapeutic interventions that LGBT individuals found effective in counseling.  Qualities of the \ntherapist and therapeutic relationship that led to positive experiences of counseling included the \nclient perceiving the therapist as being warm, respectful, trustworthy, and caring; the therapist \nbeing knowledgeable and affirming of the client’s sexual orientation and/or gender identity; and \nthe therapist respecting the client’s right to decide when and who to come out to (Israel et al., \n2008).   \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 19 \nTherapeutic interventions that were found helpful included interventions that were \nstructured; interventions that helped clients to gain insight, alleviate symptoms, and identify \ncoping skills; and interventions that only addressed sexual orientation and gender identity issues \nwhen they were relevant to the client’s presenting issue (Israel et al., 2008).  Unhelpful situations \nin counseling included times when clients perceived the therapist as being cold, disrespectful, \nuncaring, and disengaged; times when therapists imposed their values, judgments, or decision on \nclients; and times when therapists focused on sexual orientation and gender identity issues when \nthey were not relevant to the client’s presenting issue (Israel et al., 2008). \nBurckell and Goldfried (2006) conducted a study to investigate the therapist \ncharacteristics that sexual minority clients felt were important about the presenting issue being \nrelated to sexual orientation.  The study included 42 non-heterosexual adults and used a \nquestionnaire and Q- Card Sort to obtain information from the participants.  Therapist \ncharacteristics that were identified as essential to effective counseling included the therapist \nhaving knowledge about sexual orientation, the therapist being LGB affirming, and the \ntherapist’s ability to create a therapeutic alliance with the client (Burckell & Goldfried, 2006). \n Therapist characteristics that were found ineffective when working with LGB individuals \nincluded the therapist’s lack of understanding of LGB individuals and issues, the therapist's \noveremphasis on the individual’s sexual orientation, and the therapist’s use of heterocentric \nlanguage (Burckell & Goldfried, 2006). \nThe literature review provided the background to anchor the following research \nquestions: 1.  Are LGBTQIA students attending counseling specifically to discuss issues related \nto sexual orientation and gender identity?  2.  How comfortable are LGBTQIA students \ndiscussing issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in counseling?  3. What factors \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 20 \ncontributed to LGBTQIA students being willing to discuss issues related to sexual orientation \nand gender identity in counseling?  4.  What factors hindered LGBTQIA students from \ndiscussing issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in counseling?  To ensure \ncommon terminology is understood in this literature review, the following section will discuss \nfrequently used terms relating to sexual orientation, gender identity, and the LGBTQIA \npopulation. \nMethod \nParticipants \nParticipants in this study were college students who attended college at a state university \nin Upstate New York.  Participants had completed at least one appointment at the college \ncounseling center between the Fall of 2015 and February 2017.  Eighty-six students started the \nsurvey but only 61 completed the survey.  Of the 61 surveys completed, 13 surveys were \nexcluded from the study because the participants identified as being straight and cisgender.  Of \nthe remaining 48 participants in the study, the participants’ sexual orientations and gender \nidentities were as follows: \n \nSexual Orientation/Gender Identity Number of Participants \nLesbian/Female 8 \nLesbian/Gender Fluid 1 \nLesbian/Trans Female 1 \nGay/Male 7 \nGay/Female 1 \nGay/Trans Male 1 \nBisexual/Female 12 \nBisexual/Male 2 \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 21 \nBisexual/Questioning 1 \nQueer/Other (Nadleehi- 2 Spirited) 1 \nAsexual/Gender Fluid 1 \nAsexual/Male 1 \nPansexual/Female 1 \nPansexual/Trans Male 1 \nOther (unspecified)/Male 1 \n2 or more sexual orientations or gender identities 8 \n \nMaterials \nThe researcher for this study created a survey based on the research questions and \nresearch found in the literature review.  The survey consisted of 13 questions that inquired about \nthe students’ perceptions of whether or not the Counseling Center is a safe place to discuss \nsexual orientation and gender identity issues and the factors that contributed to these perceptions. \n The format of the survey consisted of 12 questions that asked the participant to select the \nanswers that related to their experiences or beliefs and one open-ended question that asked for \nsuggestions to help make the Counseling Center a more comfortable and safe place to discuss \nissues related to sexual orientation and gender identity. \nProcedure \nThe Hazen Counseling Center provided an email list of 1,164 students who had \nappointments between August 2015 and February 2017, and sent out the description of the study \nand link to the survey on the researcher’s behalf. The surveys were completed using the Qualtrics \nSoftware provided by The College at Brockport.  Participants were asked to complete the survey \nwithin one week.  A reminder email was sent to participants who had not completed the survey \none week and three weeks after the original email was sent.  Participants were advised that they \ncould skip any question they wanted to and also could choose not to participate in the study at \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 22 \nany time.  After 30 days, the survey was closed and the researcher received the data from the \nsurvey through Qualtrics. \nResults \n Thirty days after the initial email was sent out to participants, the survey was closed and the \nresults were calculated using the Qualtrics software.  Qualtrics provided descriptive statistics for the \nLikert scale questions and percentages for questions where participants could select more than one option. \n The researcher used thematic coding to identify the results from the one open ended question in the \nsurvey.  The survey results are as follows: \nLikert Scale Questions \nThe survey include the following four Likert scale statements: \n1. “Issues related to my sexual orientation and/or gender identity brought me to seek counseling at \nThe Hazen Counseling Center.” \n2. “I believe the Counseling Center is a safe place to discuss issues related to my sexual orientation \nand/or gender identity.” \n3. “My counselor openly discussed issues about sexual orientation and/or gender identity.” \n4. “My counselor did not assume that issues related to my sexual orientation and/or gender identity \nwere the reason for me seeking counseling.” \nThe descriptive statistics analysis of the four Likert scale statements are demonstrated in Table 1. \n N Mean Std.

Counselor characteristics of \nbeing non-judgmental and empathic were cited as the most prevalent factors that contributed to \nparticipants feeling safe to discuss these issues. More than half of the participants believed that the \ncounselors were knowledgeable about sexual orientation and gender identity issues.  Counselors \nacknowledging and discussing the issues of heterosexism, internalized homophobia, and the effects of \nbeing an oppressed population were among the factors that were least reported by participants.   \nParticipants who did not feel safe discussing these issues attributed it to counselors imposing their \npersonal values and judgments; counselors not understanding how sexual orientation and gender identity \nimpacts the individual’s relationships; counselors not being able to make suitable referrals and \nrecommendations; and counselors assuming that the individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity was \nthe reason for counseling. \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 26 \n Participants reported that they would like more resources to be made available by the counseling \ncenter in regards to issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity.  Resources for LGBTQIA \nstudents on the counseling center website was identified as the most desired resource, followed by, group \ncounseling and psychoeducational programs on sexual orientation and gender identity.  A support group \nfor sexual orientation issues was found to be the most desired group identified for group counseling. \nAlthough participants stated that they would like to have group counseling made available for issues \nrelated to sexual orientation and gender identity, less than half who responded reported that they would \nattend the group counseling.   \nOpen-ended Question \n Seven participants responded to the open ended question, “What suggestions, if any, do you have \nfor the Counseling Center to make it a more comfortable and safe place to discuss issues related to your \nsexual orientation or gender identity.”  From the seven response, two prominent themes were derived \nusing thematic coding:  Education/Training of Counselors and Resources for LGBTQIA students. \n Education/Training of Counselors.  Participants reported they believe counselors at the \nCounseling Center should be educated on the different types of identity, specifically in relation to gender. \n Participants described that there are many identities in which a person may identify and some are less \nknown than others, but it is important for the counselors to be aware of the variations so that they can \nadequately help the student.  It was suggested that counselors “openly and honestly discuss together \nand/or with a profession their own inquiries and biases when working with an individual who wishes to \ndiscuss their sexual identity and/or gender identity.”   \n Resources.  Participants stated that they would like to see more resources for LGBTQIA students \nmade available by the Counseling Center.  Resources included, “having openly gay counselors,” “having \nposters or information pamphlets about different identities,” and “finding resources to help me transition, \nbeyond pointing me to people I literally cannot afford to see.”  The resources that were identified by \nparticipants appeared to be more related to issues of gender identity than sexual orientation, which also \nwas reflected in the education/training of counselors previously discussed.   \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 27 \nDiscussion \n The results from this study reflect the concepts identified in the literature review about \nwhat makes an LGBTQIA individual feel safe or unsafe to discuss issues related to sexual \norientation and gender identity in a counseling session.  Factors related to the therapeutic \nrelationship and counselor attributes were among the greatest reasons participants reported \nfeeling comfortable discussing these issues in counseling.  As supported in the literature, \nparticipants who believed counselors were knowledgeable and affirming of issues related to \nsexual orientation and gender identity were more likely to experience the counseling experience \nas a safe place to discuss these issues.  Counseling experiences where the LGBTQIA individual \nfelt that the counselor did not understand sexual orientation or gender identity issues and how \nthey impact the individual were seen as unhelpful. \nOverall, LGBTQIA students perceived the counseling center as a safe place to discuss \nissues related to sexual orientation and gender identity.  Counselor characteristics of being \nnonjudgmental and empathic were among the highest reasons LGBTQIA students felt safe \ndiscussing issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity at the counseling center.  \nFactors that were identified as hindering an LGBTQIA person from discussing issues related to \nsexual orientation and gender identity included, counselors not understanding how an LGBTQIA \nindividual’s sexual orientation or gender identity impacts that person’s relationships, lack of \nresources to refer LGBTQIA students to, and counselors not being informed about specific \nsexual and gender identities.  Participants also identified that they would like to see more \nresources made available through the counseling center website. \nThis study had several limitations that should be considered.  One limitation of this study \nwas that it only covered the time period between Fall 2015 and February 2017.  Any LGBTQIA \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 28 \nstudents who visited the Counseling Center prior to that time period were not included in the \nstudy.  Limiting the time period for the selection process limited the amount of potential \nparticipants in the study.  Another limitation of this study was the sensitive nature of the study \nmay have caused some people not to participate.  The researcher tried to minimize this limitation \nby making the survey anonymous but there is still the possibility that LGBTQIA individuals \nchose not to participate in the study because they did not want to identify their sexual orientation \nor gender identity.   \nBased on the current study, there are several implications for counselors.  First, the study \nshows a need for counseling professionals to be educated on issues related to sexual orientation \nand gender identity.  Counselors should be educated on all forms of sexual orientation and \ngender identity, even ones that are less commonly discussed in literature.  Secondly, counselors \nshould openly discuss issues related to heteronormativity, internalized homophobia, and the \neffects of being an oppressed minority with an LGBTQIA individual during counseling.  Thirdly, \ncounselors should be knowledgeable about the campus and community resources that are \navailable for LGBTQIA so that they can make appropriate referrals and recommendations when \nnecessary.   \n Based on the data collected in this study, the researcher recommends that the counseling \ncenter consider the following:  \n Add LGBTQIA resources on the counseling center website \n Continue to offer SafeZone trainings to professional counseling staff \n Establish a partnership with Sexual Orientations United for Liberations (SOUL)  \n Conduct campus outreach to inform students about the services available for LGBTQIA \nstudents \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 29 \n Offer group counseling in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity issues \n Establish connection in the community for referrals and outreach opportunities \nFuture research should expand on the current research and evaluate the efficacy of any \nchanges implemented in the counseling center from the aforementioned suggestions.  The study \nhas shown that although LGBTQIA students do believe the college counseling center is a safe \nplace to discuss issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity, there are opportunities \nfor the college to provide more resources and educational training to the professional counseling \nstaff.  Future research may also want to look at the perspectives of the counseling professionals \nto see what their perceptions are on the level of care they provide to LGBTQIA students in \nregards to sexual orientation and gender identity issues.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLGBTQIA STUDENTS’ PERCEPTIONS OF CARE 30 \n \n \nAppendix A \n \nSurvey \n \nPlease indicate the sexual orientation that you most closely identify with. \n Lesbian \n Gay \n Bisexual \n Queer \n Questioning \n Asexual \n Straight \n Pansexual \n Other ____________________ \n \nPlease indicate the gender identity that you most closely identify with. \n Male \n Female \n Trans Male \n Trans Female \n Bigender \n Intersex \n Gender Queer \n Gender Fluid \n Questioning \n Other ____________________ \n \nPlease indicate the response that best describes your thoughts or experiences.

In this study, 48 LGBTQIA students completed a survey to ascertain their perceptions on whether or not the college counseling center was a safe place to discuss issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Results showed that LGBTQIA did believe the counseling center was a safe place to discuss issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity but also identified that additional resources and counselor education on LGBTQIA issues could be help improve the LGBTQIA students’ perception of level of care at the counseling center",
