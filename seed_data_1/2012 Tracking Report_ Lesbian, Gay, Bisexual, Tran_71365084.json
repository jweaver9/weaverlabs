This 11th annual edition of the tracking report captures data on  4,068 grants awarded by 399 foundations, making it the most comprehensive assessment of lGBTQ funding.This year, foundation funding of lGBTQ issues totaled $121.4 million, a slight decrease from the 2011 total of $123  million. Much of this slight decrease, however, is due to short-term factors such as foundation transitions and the  funding cycles of re-granting initiatives. Generally, funding for lGBTQ issues was largely stable in 2012, a likely  temporary pause in its overall trajectory of rapid expansion in recent years. As in previous years, lGBTQ funding  is barely one quarter of one percent of all foundation funding. In this year's report, we have re-vamped the substance and format of our analysis to maximize its usefulness for our  members, for the wider philanthropic field, and for the lGBTQ movement. A few of the highlights of the new model:•\t \tWe\thave\tprovided\tseparate\tsections\ton\tdomestic\tand\tinternational\tgrantmaking,\texploring\teach\tof\tthese\t distinct areas of funding in greater depth.•\t \tWithin\tboth\tdomestic\tand\tinternational\tgrantmaking,\twe\thave\tprovided\ta\tbreakdown\tof\tfunding\tby\t geographic region. •\t \tWe\thave\talso\tpresented\ta\tmore\tdetailed\tpicture\tof\tLGBTQ\tfunding\tby\tcommunity\tfoundations,\t corporate funders, private foundations, and public funders. •\t \tFor\tmost\tof\tthe\tdata,\twe\thave\tpresented\t2012\tfigures\tside-by-side\twith\tthose\tfrom\t2011,\tto\tfacilitate\t year-to-year comparison.Moreover, we have also sought to present the data in a visual and compelling manner that is easy to absorb  and understand.I hope this report in its new incarnation will be useful to funders, nonprofit leaders, and other stakeholders in  identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities for lGBTQ grantmaking. It also provides an invaluable tool for assessing  our progress in our own mission of expanding the scale and impact of lGBTQ funding. Keep watching throughout  2014 for more new reports and resources providing the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and relevant information  on lGBTQ philanthropy.

This is roughly a one percent decrease from 2011, when  we identified $123 million in grants for lGBTQ issues. Foundations also granted an additional $12.7 million to public foundations and other intermediaries for the purposes of re-granting to lGBTQ communities — more than double the $5.5 million awarded for re-granting in 2011. with re-granting  dollars included, lGBTQ grantmaking totaled $134 million, a record high. we generally exclude these dollars from our analysis to avoid double-counting. However, dollars awarded through intermediaries are not necessarily re-granted in  the same calendar year. Given the high dollar amount awarded for re-granting in 2012, some of the modest decrease  in total lGBTQ grants may be more due to the cyclical nature of re-granting initiatives than to any substantive decline. In addition, the Arcus Foundation, one of the top lGBTQ funders, conducted a strategic review in 2012 that led to the launch of a new lGBTQ strategy in early 2013. Although Arcus’s lGBTQ grantmaking has since returned to its previous  run rate, transition to the new strategy resulted in an $8-million decrease in that foundation’s lGBT grantmaking in 2012, significantly reducing the overall total in comparison to 2011. Arcus’s 2013 lGBTQ grantmaking is currently on track  to achieve its previous level of about $16 million. This further indicates that this year’s slight decrease in total dollars  is an aberration. However, it also demonstrates the vulnerable position of lGBTQ funding, which remains highly  sensitive to any fluctuations in the handful of top funders that provide the lion’s share of foundation support for  lGBTQ communities.Generally, the level of lGBTQ funding was stable in 2012, a likely temporary pause in its broader trajectory of growth. 30,000,00060,000,00090,000,000120,000,000150,000,0002003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012lGBTQ Funding, 2003-20122003 $32,128,895 2004 $48,772,174 2005 $58,269,914 2006 $71,336,251 2007 $80,295,279 2008  $116,181,019 2009 $96,533,298 2010 $96,829,756 2011 $123,012,4232012 $121,412,4902012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations62003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012$10.0$20.0$30.0$40.0$50.0$60.0LGBTQ foundation funding has risen rapidly in the past ten years, nearly quadrupling from $32 million in 2003 to its current level. This growth has been more sporadic and less dramatic since 2009, when the effects of the Great Recession lowered  foundation grantmaking overall. Nevertheless, the growth of LGBTQ funding has far outpaced the growth of foundation  funding generally, which has increased by about two-thirds in the past decade. Despite the growth of funding for LGBTQ issues, it remains a tiny fraction of all foundation funding — about 0.24 percent  of the $50.9 billion total that the Foundation Center estimates was awarded by foundations in 2012.

Support from private foundations was split roughly  evenly between foundations founded by lesbian and gay donors and those founded by non-LGBT-identified donors.  Nearly all funder categories increased their support of LGBTQ issues between 2011 and 2012. Particularly significant  increases are notable from anonymous funders (a 30 percent increase), LGBTQ public foundations (a 29 percent increase),  and corporations (a 27 percent increase). Non-LGBTQ private foundations also modestly increased their collective funding  of LGBTQ issues, by $2.3 million or seven percent. There were only two types of funders that decreased their overall funding of LGBTQ issues between 2011 and 2012: lesbian and gay private foundations, which was almost entirely due to the temporary dip in funding from one of the top funders;  and community foundations, which saw a modest decrease of less than $400,000.Excluding dollars awarded by anonymous funders, approximately 36 percent of 2012 dollars ($48 million) for LGBTQ issues were driven by LGBTQ donors themselves, either through lesbian and gay private foundations or LGBTQ public foundations. This is down slightly from 2011, when LGBTQ funders provided 42 percent of support for LGBTQ issues.Sources of lGBTQ Grant Dollars by Funder Type15% Anonymous Funders  ($20,395,810) 4% Community Foundations  ($5,498,826)7% Corporations  ($8,994,372)26% Non-lGBTQ  Private Foundations  ($35,385,402 )25% lesbian & Gay  Private Foundations  ($33,051,913)11% lGBTQ Public Foundations  ($14,920,707)12% Other Public Foundations  (15,834,128)TOTAl ($134,081,158)12% Anonymous Funders ($15,685,000) 5% Community Foundations ($5,871,673)6% Corporations ($7,076,201)26% Non-lGBTQ Private Foundations ($33,639,473)31% lesbian & Gay Private Foundations ($40,396,087)9% lGBTQ Public Foundations ($11,579,896)11% Other Public Foundations ($14,236,574)TOTAl ($128,484,903)20112012Note: : In contrast to other parts of this report, this section includes dollars awarded to public foundations for the purposes of re-granting. This does result in the  double-counting of re-granting dollars in this section, but is the most accurate way to capture the full amount of LGBTQ funding coming from (or through) the  various types of funders.2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations8 TOP GRANTMAKERSThis year, we are providing two lists of top grantmakers for LGBTQ issues. The first list is of private foundations — entities  that were largely founded and funded by a single donor, whether an individual, family, or corporation. The second is of public funders — such as community foundations, public foundations, or nonprofits that award grants — all of which have the same 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and raise funds from many donors and funding sources. Since about  $10 million of annual LGBTQ funding from public funders  originally comes from private foundations, we have separated these two categories to avoid double-counting on the same list and to maintain “apples-to-apples” comparisons. We have also provided further detail in the new sections on LGBTQ funding from community foundations, corporations, private foundations, and public funders.As in past years, the top LGBTQ funders provided a large  share of all 2012 LGBTQ grant dollars. In particular, the top  ten private funders of LGBTQ issues collectively awarded  more than $70 million, or 58 percent of the year’s total. Of the top ten private funders, half were founded by  gay donors: Gill Foundation, Arcus Foundation, H. Van  Ameringen Foundation, Calamus Foundation, and David Bohnett Foundation. On the public funder side, half of the  top ten funders are also rooted in LGBTQ communities:  Pride Foundation, Elton John AIDS Foundation, Astraea  Lesbian Foundation for Justice, Human Rights Campaign Foundation, and the Horizons Foundation.Top 10 Private Funders This list includes all funders with private foundation status: family foundations, corporate foundations, and other private foundations. 1 AnonymousVarious locations$20,395,810 2 Ford FoundationNew York, NY $11,447,4913 Gill FoundationDenver, CO$8,889,520 4 Arcus FoundationNew York, NY$8,176,5865  Evelyn & walter  Haas, Jr. FundSan Francisco, CA$5,585,5006  Open Society FoundationsNew York, NY$5,030,385 7  wells Fargo FoundationSan Francisco, CA$3,562,008 8  H. van Ameringen  FoundationNew York, NY$3,078,500 9 Calamus Foundation, Inc.New York, NY $2,406,000 10  David Bohnett  FoundationNew York, NY$2,156,262  TOTAl $70,728,062 Top 10 Public FundersThis list includes all funders with fully tax-exempt nonprofit status: public foundations, community foundations, and nonprofit  organizations that award grants to other nonprofits.1 Pride FoundationSeattle, WA$5,163,8712 Tides FoundationSan Francisco, CA$2,719,3263  American Jewish  world ServiceNew York, NY$2,221,0034  Elton John AIDS  FoundationNew York, NY$2,192,2815 Proteus FundAmherst, MA$1,817,0006  Astraea lesbian  Foundation for JusticeNew York, NY$1,144,324 7  Human Rights  Campaign FoundationWashington, DC$1,099,435 8 Public Interest ProjectsNew York, NY$1,095,0009  Horizons FoundationSan Francisco, CA$1,086,857 10  Komen Foundation, Susan G.Dallas, TX$1,069,999 TOTAl $19,609,0962012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 9The top 10 recipients of LGBTQ funding received a total of $28.3 million, accounting for 23% of all LGBTQ dollars granted in 2012.

There was an $8-million decrease in grant dollars for internationally-focused organizations and NGOs outside the U.S. Giving for statewide organizations decreased  by about $3 million, while dollars  for local and regional organizations were relatively stable. As in prior years, local organizations received the greatest number of LGBTQ grants. Distribution of lGBTQ Grant Dollars by Geographic Focus20112012  TYPE OF  SUPPORTMost LGBTQ dollars (62 percent) and grants (55 percent) were devoted to program support as opposed to general operating support.

Funding for transgender communities also increased, reaching a record high of $5.3 million.Funding targeting lesbians totaled $3.9 million in 2012, down by a full 37 percent from 2011. Funding for intersex communities increased from 2011 but remained a small fraction of total grant dollars.Grant dollars explicitly targeting bisexual communities totaled more than $450,000 in 2012, far higher than we have reported in prior years. However, most of this reported increase was not due to a substantive expansion of funding, but rather due  to the addition of a bisexuality-focused funder whose grants data is included this year for the first time. That funder, the  American Institute of Bisexuality, awarded nearly $440,000 in 2012 for research projects to promote understanding and  visibility of bisexuality.

The specific advocacy strategies  of litigation, public education, and community organizing each saw  increases of about $500,000 or more.As in 2011, capacity-building was  the second most-funded strategy,  but it decreased both in grant dollars and as a share of total grant dollars,  dropping by more than $3 million  to about $17.5 million (14 percent  of the total). Direct service and  research saw modest increases,  while culture and media decreased  by more than $2 million.ZoomInG In: Funding for Public Education CampaignsOf the $7 million devoted to public education, 60 percent ($4.2 million) was for raising awareness around  marriage equality.Distribution of lGBTQ Grant Dollars by Strategies Funded49% Advocacy ($60,038,260)14% Capacity-Building & Training ($17,522,929)13% Direct Service ($16,253,850)10% Research ($11,947,110)6% Culture & Media ($6,960,952)4% Philanthropy  & Fundraising  ($4,482,345)4% Other ($4,207,045)TOTAl ($121,412,490)45% Advocacy ($55,933,109)17% Capacity-Building & Training  ($20,711,658)13% Direct Service ($15,672,985)9% Research ($11,215,811)8% Culture & Media ($9,272,385)3% Philanthropy & Fundraising ($4,014,562)5% Other ($6,191,913)TOTAl ($123,012,423)201120122012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 13Detailed Breakdown of Strategies Funded 2012 2011Advocacy $60,038,260 49% $55,933,109 45%Advocacy (General)  $42,803,726 34%  $40,526,773 33%Community organizing  $2,755,365 2%  $2,041,926 2%Litigation  $7,421,593 6%  $6,971,574 6%Public Education  $7,057,576 6%  $6,392,836 5%Capacity-Building & Training  $17,522,929 14%  $20,711,658 17%Conferences/Seminars  $1,032,582 1%  $1,404,242 1%Leadership Development  $6,194,212 5%  $5,980,441 5%Organizational Capacity Building  $6,505,480 5%  $7,306,668 6%Training & Technical Assistance  $3,790,655 3%  $6,020,3078 5%Direct Service  $16,253,850 13%  $15,672,985 13%Research $11,947,110 10%  $11,215,811 9%Curriculum Development  $83,500 <1%  $973,195 1%Publications  $226,916 <1%  $545,019 <1%Research  $11,636,694 10%  $9,697,597 8%Culture & Media  $6,960,952 6%  $9,272,385 8%Culture  $3,568,278 3%  $3,913,333 3%Electronic Media/Online services  $1,552,486 1%  $2,352,879 2%Film/Video/Radio Production  $1,840,188 2%  $3,006,173 2%Philanthropy & Fundraising $4,482,345 4%  $4,014,562 3%Fundraising Event  $1,789,063 1%  $724,512 1%Matching Grant  $177,265 <1%  $109,520 <1%Philanthropy  $2,516,017 2%  $3,180,530 3%Other  $4,207,045 4%  $6,191,913 5%Multi-Strategy  $4,179,545 4%  $5,783,966 5%Other  $27,500 <1%  $407,947 <1%TOTAl  $121,412,490  $123,012,423 2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations14THIS PAGE HAS BEEN INTENTIONAllY lEFT BlANK.2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 15DOMESTIC FUNDING OF lGTBQ ISSUESIn 2012, funding for lGBTQ issues in the United States exceeded $100 million for the first-time ever. Setting a new record, domestic funding for lGBTQ issues increased to over $101 million, up from $95 million in 2011. Overall, however, the picture of domestic funding in 2012 largely mirrored 2011. Civil rights work received nearly half of all domestic funding. Similarly, advocacy organizations received over 50 percent of all domestic funding. Gay and lesbian private foundations accounted for the largest percentage of support (27 percent). All private foundations taken together accounted for over 50 percent of domestic funding.while domestic funding at the local and statewide level decreased slightly, funding for national organizations increased nearly $11 million or 25 percent.

Funding went from $50.5 million in 2011 to $46.3 million in 2012. New York saw $11.7 million in funding, surpassing California (which saw $9.8 million) to become the state with the most local or statewide funding for LGBTQ people. These were the only states to receive more than $3.5 million in funding. Only ten states received $1 million or more in funding, down from eleven states at that level in 2011.Despite the overall decrease in state and local funding, some states still experienced a dramatic increase in their funding.  Funding for North Dakota increased more than twenty-fold, from $500 to $11,000 and funding for Hawaii more than tripled, from $30,050 to $95,073. Both states remain far below the median state funding level of $136,988. Other states saw significant decreases. Kentucky’s funding declined by 98 percent and West Virginia’s funding declined by 96 percent. Kentucky went from $430,015 in 2011 to $7,000 in 2012; West Virginia went from $40,000 in 2011 to $1,500 in 2012.Alabama $40,500Alaska  $6,500Arizona $113,720Arkansas  $14,000California  $9,761,484Colorado  $973,940Connecticut  $237,500Delaware  $36,000District of Columbia  $513,311Florida  $1,219,443Georgia  $527,975Hawaii  $95,073Idaho  $48,200Illinois  $2,587,687Indiana  $25,500Iowa  $205,500Kansas  —  Kentucky  $7,000Louisiana  $81,008Maine  $863,251Maryland  $458,671Massachusetts  $3,350,123Michigan  $1,350,616Minnesota  $1,766,259Mississippi  $50,000Missouri  $284,113Montana  $85,509Nebraska  $31,050Nevada  $242,750New Hampshire —New Jersey  $149,520New Mexico  $241,267New York  $11,687,851North Carolina  $466,113 North Dakota  $60,000Ohio  $245,051Oklahoma  $65,250Oregon  $1,267,097Pennsylvania  $900,381Rhode Island  $123,938South Carolina  $75,500South Dakota —Tennessee  $39,040Texas  $1,925,525Utah  $668,922Vermont  $151,896Virginia  $263,384Washington  $2,215,428West Virginia  $1,500Wisconsin  $723,330Wyoming  $3,000 Funding by State$3,500,000 – $12,000,000$1,000,000 – $3,499,999$500,000 – $999,999$100,000 – $499,999$50,000 – $99,999$15,000 – $49,999$1 – $14,999$02012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 17 FUNDING PER lGBTQ ADUlTTo assess the level of funding for each state relative to its population, we have also provided a “per capita” estimate based  on the total grant dollars in each state divided by the estimated number of adults in the state who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Since local and statewide funding for LGBTQ communities slightly decreased, the national average  of local dollars per LGBTQ adult dropped 52 cents from $6.04 to $5.52. However, the median for statewide and local funding per LGBTQ adult increased. In 2012 the median for the 50 states and the District of Columbia was $2.06 versus $1.68 in 2011. In 2012, twenty-two states saw an increase in the amount of foundation dollars they received per LGBTQ adult. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia saw a decrease. Four states received the same per capita funding.New York had the largest per capita funding at $20.26. Two states had per capita funding exceeding $15, seven states had  per capita funding exceeding $10, and fifteen states had per capita funding exceeding $5. Washington State had the largest per capita funding increase, going from $3.66 to $10.55 per LGBTQ adult. Oregon, the state with the largest per capita funding  figure in 2011, saw the greatest decrease, going from $26.18 per capita to $8.60. However, this is still more than 1.5 times higher than the average per capita of $5.52.Note: : Estimates of the LGBTQ adult population are taken from the Movement Advancement Project (MAP) based on recent Gallup and Williams Institute data.Alabama $0.39Alaska $0.36Arizona $0.60Arkansas $0.18California $8.59Colorado $7.83Connecticut $2.52Delaware $1.51District of Columbia $10.01Florida $2.31Georgia $2.06Hawaii $1.74Idaho $1.54 Montana $4.24Nebraska $0.83Nevada $2.81New Hampshire $—New Jersey $0.60New Mexico $5.32New York $20.26North Carolina $1.92North Dakota $6.62Ohio $0.77Oklahoma $0.67Oregon $8.60Pennsylvania $3.34 Illinois $6.97Indiana $0.14Iowa $3.14Kansas $—Kentucky $0.05Louisiana $0.73Maine $16.98Maryland $3.10Massachusetts $14.69Michigan $4.69Minnesota $14.97Mississippi $0.86Missouri $1.87 Rhode Island $3.31South Carolina $0.72South Dakota $—Tennessee $0.31Texas $3.12Utah $12.79Vermont $6.19Virginia $1.45Washington $10.55West Virginia $0.03Wisconsin $5.89Wyoming $0.24 Funding Per lGBTQ Adult by State$15.01 – $21.00$10.01 – $15.00$5.01 – $10.0$2.51 – $5.00$1.01 – $2.50$0.51 – $1.00$0.01 – $0.50$02012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations18Looking at domestic LGBTQ funding by issue, the largest portion by far ($42 million, or 42 percent of the total) was devoted to civil rights. This broad category includes funding for organizations and advocacy efforts addressing civil rights generally, as well as programs and campaigns around specific policy issues, such as marriage equality, employment nondiscrimination, military inclusion, gender identity-based rights, and immigrant rights. The second largest share of dollars was devoted to health issues, which received nearly $16 million, or about 16 percent of the total. About 43 percent of health dollars were focused on HIV/AIDS, including services, community engagement programs, and policy change efforts. Other health-related grant dollars included funding for mental health services, services for LGBTQ elders, awareness-raising around health issues such as breast cancer, and policy and outreach efforts to assure full LGBTQ  inclusion in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.Also receiving a notable share of funding were various efforts to build LGBTQ community, including strengthening  LGBTQ families, improving LGBTQ visibility in media and the arts, and increasing inclusiveness in faith-based communities  — all of which collectively received 13 percent of domestic grant dollars. Education and safe schools captured $7.6 million (about eight percent), an increase of more than $600,000 over 2011.

In 2012, communities of color were the target population of $11.2 million in grants, or about 11 percent of the year's  domestic LGBTQ grant dollars. This constitutes a decrease from 2011, when communities of color received $14.4 million. However, an additional $1.1 million was granted to the Astraea Foundation for the Racial Justice Collaborative, the bulk of which will be re-granted in future years. Funding for LGBTQ communities of color in 2012 was also affected by the temporary decrease in grantmaking by the Arcus Foundation, which is the top funder of LGBTQ people of color. (It is important to note that Arcus’ new strategy, launched earlier this year, arguably deepens its commitment to communities of color.)Looking at other target populations, children and youth received the largest share of grant dollars: $21.4 million, or about  22 percent of all domestic grant dollars. This is an increase from 2011, when children and youth accounted for $17.8 million  of U.S. dollars. Grant dollars also increased in 2012 for LGBTQ older adults, immigrants, sex workers, and economically  disadvantaged populations.ZoomInG In: Domestic Funding Targeting Gay MenOf domestic grant dollars targeting gay men and men who have sex with men (MSM), 84 percent was for HIV/AIDS. Men who have sex with men still account for two-thirds of all new HIV infections in the U.S.Recommended ResouRceFor more information about funding for HIV/AIDS, check out the recent report from our sister affinity group,  Funders Concerned About AIDS: Global Philanthropic Support to Address HIV/AIDS in 2012.

Our hope is that this will offer a new and more detailed picture of the types of institutions that funders  are investing in. lGBTQ Organizations vs.  Non-lGBTQ Organizations:  We identified whether each grantee was an LGBTQ  organization, defined as having a mission and programs entirely or primarily dedicated to LGBTQ issues, or a non- LGBTQ focused organization, defined as an organization with a mission not explicitly centered on LGBTQ issues. In the case of non-LGBTQ organizations, the grantees in this data set received funding for LGBTQ-specific programs, campaigns, or outreach efforts.  We found that three-quarters of domestic LGBTQ funding were awarded to LGBTQ-specific organizations, and the remaining quarter was awarded to “mainstream” nonprofit organizations.Note: Not included in this total are $1.2 million awarded to individuals (largely for scholarships) and approximately $1 million awarded to uncategorized  organizations that received less than $10,000 in grants in 2012.

The annual National LGBT  Movement Report has found that advocacy organizations account for approximately 41-45 percent of all LGBT  nonprofit organizational expenses in the U.S.  — mirroring our own findings on the predominance of advocacy in  LGBT funding. The movement report and many other resources are available for download at www.lgbtmap.org. 2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations24Looking more closely at LGBTQ grantees, we categorized each using a taxonomy of organizations similar to that  used by the Movement Advancement Project (MAP).  Advocacy organizations received a substantive majority  (62 percent) of funding for LGTBQ organizations. Service providers (including community centers, HIV/AIDS service organizations, and youth centers) received the second  largest share, at 25 percent of the total. National LGBTQ advocacy organizations received about  two-thirds of the dollars going to advocacy groups, followed by state-level advocacy organizations and legal services  organizations.. Local advocacy organizations — most of which are small, grassroots groups — received about four percent of the dollars for LGBTQ advocacy organizations.Infrastructure organizations, including public foundations and organizations that serve other organizations (such as CenterLink), received six percent of dollars for LGBTQ-focused organizations. Four percent went to social and community organizations, including churches and other faith-based groups, nonprofits that run pride parades, and various profes-sional networks and social groups. The smallest portion ($2.5 million) went to the arts and cultural sector, which includes organizations that promote LGBTQ culture and history as well as performing arts groups such as LGBTQ choruses.62%3%6%25%4%Breakdown of lGBTQ Advocacy OrganizationsLegal services organizationsLocal advocacy organizationsNational advocacy organizationsRegional advocacy organizationsState equality organizationsDetailed Breakdown of lGBTQ Organizations Advocacy organizations $45,496,525 62%Legal services organizations  $5,618,386 8%Local advocacy organizations  $2,035,464 3%National advocacy organizations  $29,719,430 40%Regional advocacy organizations  $2,279,075 3%State equality organizations  $5,844,170 8%Arts & cultural organizations  $2,529,123 3%Infrastructure organizations  $4,403,471 6%Private foundations  $718,000 1%Public foundations/fundraising organizations $2,162,627 3%TA providers/networks  $1,522,844 2%Service providers $18,002,823 25%AIDS service organizations  $3,839,730 5%Community centers  $6,884,313 9%Health centers  $3,321,682 5%Other services  $1,291,760 2%Youth centers  $2,665,338 4%Social & recreational  organizations $2,779,951 4%Athletic groups  $25,000 <1%Faith-based organizations  $351,829 <1%Pride organizations  $121,275 <1%Social groups & networks  $2,281,847 3%TOTAl  $73,211,893   ANAlYSIS OF DOMESTIC FUNDING FOR  lGBTQ ORGANIzATIONS2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 25Allied advocacy organizations received the largest  share (42 percent) of funds awarded to non-LGBTQ  organizations.

These organizations were largely funded for their work in coalition with LGBTQ communities  on a range of issues.Several other types of non-LGBTQ organizations received significant portions of funding: infrastructure organizations (largely for funding initiatives or for mainstream technical  assistance providers offering services to LGBTQ organizations), universities (including dollars for research on LGBTQ issues and scholarships for LGBTQ students), and mainstream  service providers (ranging from foster care services to hospitals, much of it for increasing these institutions’ cultural competence for working with LGBTQ communities). 42%1%3%6%17%15%14%2%Detailed Breakdown of Non-lGBTQ  OrganizationsAdvocacy organizations $10,187,136 42%Arts & cultural organizations  $716,150 3%Infrastructure organizations  $4,284,738 17%Public foundations/fundraising organizations $3,231,282 75%TA providers/networks  $1,053,456 25%Service providers $3,500,596 14%Government agencies  (including public school systems) $446,800 2%Faith-based organizations $271,214 1%Research institutes  $1,455,000 6%Universities and  post-secondary schools $3,679,801 15%TOTAl  $24,541,435   ANAlYSIS OF DOMESTIC FUNDING FOR  NON-lGBTQ ORGANIzATIONS2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations26THIS PAGE HAS BEEN INTENTIONAllY lEFT BlANK.2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 27INTERNATIONAl FUNDING OF lGBTQ ISSUESFunding for lGBTQ communities outside the US totaled just over $20 million in 2012, down from $27 million the year  before. Over 40 percent of the funding for international lGBTQ work went to organizations based in the United States.  Uganda received the second highest level of funding, receiving $1.2 million or 6 percent of international funding.  In 2012, there was renewed fervor in Uganda to pass the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, more commonly known as the  “Kill the Gays” bill. Fortunately, the bill did not pass before the end of the 2012 parliament term.In 2012, the top ten international lGBTQ grantmakers awarded nearly $17.8 million in grants, representing 88 percent of total lGBTQ dollars granted for international work. The top three grantmakers alone (Open Society, Arcus, and anonymous funders) awarded more than 57 percent of all international grant dollars. International lGBTQ funding is currently highly  reliant on a small pool of funders giving at high levels, even more so than is the case for lGBTQ funding domestically.Seven of the top ten grantees for international lGBTQ work are headquartered in the U.S. Two are headquartered in  Europe. One is made up of multiple unnamed grantees, “anonymous,” which are spread across the globe at various locations.  The anonymity of these grantees is maintained so as to protect them from potential reprisal by anti-lGBTQ regimes.whereas gay and lesbian private foundations and lGBTQ public funders make up nearly forty percent of lGBTQ funding, they constitute a smaller portion of international funding at about 21 percent — only 16 and 5 percent respectively.Top 10 International lGBTQ Funders1 AnonymousVarious

Thirteen percent of dollars were for programs targeting gay  men or men who have sex with men, while lesbians and transgender communities were each the focus of eight percent  of international funding.Looking at other target populations of international LGBTQ funding, approximately $3.4 million was devoted to refugees  and other migrants, most of it for assistance for LGBTQ people fleeing persecution in their home countries. Programs  targeting children and youth also received a notable amount (nearly $900,000), most of it for development and  empowerment of LGBTQ youth.ZoomInG In: Top Issue Areas Funded for Target PopulationsOf international grant dollars targeting gay men and men who have sex with men (MSM), 94 percent were for  HIV/AIDS. Of international dollars targeting lesbians and other queer women, 56 percent were for human rights, with the remainder devoted to issues such as philanthropy , anti-violence, and community-building. International funding for transgender communities was more evenly spread, with 57 percent going to human rights and gender identity,  and 42 percent going to HIV/AIDS and other health issues.Recommended ResouRceFor more information about global funding for human rights, check out Advancing Human Rights:  The State of Global Foundation Grantmaking, published by the International Human Rights Funders Group  and the Foundation Center.

Instead, community foundations invested heavily in health issues and in building community, families and  visibility. Since community foundations are place-based funders, some of this difference may be attributed to the fact that most of the large civil rights advocacy organizations are national. In contrast, direct service providers working on health  and building community tend to be locally focused.Distribution of Community Foundation Grant Dollars by Issue Addressed2012Civil Rights / Human Rights  $1,216,276 (22%)$ $$ $ $Health  $1,287,736 (23%)$ $Building Community, Families, and visibility  $1,168,162 (21%)$Education  $271,158 (5%)violence, Homophobia and Transphobia  $151,038 (3%)Economic Issues  $251,291 (5%)$Other Issues  $1,145,665 (21%)$  = $500,000$ $2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations 37Community foundations by  definition collect resources from  a community within a specific  geographic region and then  redistribute those resources to their defined community.

Just ten years ago, corporate foundations awarded approximately $575,000  to lGBTQ issues. while corporation foundation support may constitute a relatively small portion of funding for lGBTQ  issues, it is growing at the fastest clip. Between 2003 and 2012, corporate foundation support increased fifteen-fold.In 2012, corporate foundations provided seven percent of all lGBTQ dollars, up from about six percent in 2011.whereas ten years ago it could be risky for a company to support lGBTQ causes, today many companies proudly  support the lGBTQ community. And as more and more corporations embrace lGBTQ issues, corporate funding  is an area where we might reasonably hope to see further growth in the years to come.NoTe: There are many corporations giving to the lGBTQ community without an official foundation or philanthropic  office and as such there are some companies not yet tracked in this tracking report. while we will continue to explore how we can best track corporate funding for the lGBTQ community, we want to acknowledge that the goodwill  of companies not captured in this report can have a significant impact on national nonprofits and local community  organizations. whether the money comes from an official philanthropic arm, a marketing budget, or an in-kind  donation, corporate support for lGBTQ communities warrants recognition.Top 10 Corporate Grantees1  Gay & lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GlAAD)New York, NY   $815,075 2  los Angeles Gay and lesbian Community Services CenterLos Angeles, CA   $446,105 3   Gay, lesbian and Straight Education Network (GlSEN)New York, NY   $417,8494  Services and Advocacy for Gay, lesbian, Bisexual  & Transgender Elders (SAGE)New York, NY   $400,000 5  legacy Community Health ServicesHouston, TX   $350,000 6  Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC)New York, NY   $290,669 7  Human Rights Campaign FoundationWashington, DC   $243,958 8 Tides CenterNew York, NY   $242,5009  National Gay and lesbian Task ForceWashington, DC   $215,15010  Hetrick-Martin Institute (HMI)New York, NY   $177,7752012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations40  ISSUES ADDRESSED BY CORPORATE FUNDERSForty percent of corporate foundation funding goes to LGBTQ health issues.

Nearly 40 percent of funding from corporate foundations went to support  nationally focused nonprofits.This geographic distribution of  corporate foundation funding for LGBTQ issues is notable, because,  in comparison to other funders,  corporate foundations seem to  favor awarding grants to non-profits working within the local community while national nonprofits see the  bulk of LGBTQ funding overall. 13% International  ($1,157,580) 40% National  ($3,437,949)<1% Regional  (Multi-State)  ($54,350)4% Statewide  ($341,390)43% local  ($3,693,103)TOTAl ($8,684,372)17% International ($20,260,471) 45% National ($54,936,343)2% Regional (Multi-State) ($2,621,675)10% Statewide ($12,480,893)26% local ($31,113,108)TOTAl ($121,412,490)Distribution of Corporate Grant Dollars by Geographic FocusAll FundersCommunity FoundationsZoomInG In: Corporate Foundation Support for Addressing HIV/AIDS  in LGBTQ CommunitiesIn 2012, over 25% of HIV/AIDS funding targeting LGBTQ communities came from corporate funders.

Nevertheless, private foundations continue to represent the largest slice of lGBTQ philanthropy, with their grantmaking constituting approximately 52 percent of lGBTQ funding in 2012. (Note that after re-granting dollars are excluded,  private foundations awarded about $62.2 million, which is the total you’ll see in other portions of this section.)Gay and lesbian private foundation giving decreased by $5 million in 2012 whereas funding from non-lGBT-specific private foundations increased by more than $1.5 million. The dip in the gay and lesbian private foundation category is almost entirely due to the Arcus Foundation's temporary $8-million decrease in grantmaking. Excluding Arcus, funding from gay and lesbian private foundations increased slightly, as did overall private foundation funding for lGBTQ issues.Top 10 Gay and lesbian  Private Foundations1 Gill FoundationDenver, CO   $8,889,520 2 Arcus FoundationNew York, NY   $8,176,586 3  H. van Ameringen FoundationNew York, NY   $3,078,5004 Calamus Foundation, Inc.New York, NY   $2,406,000 5  David Bohnett FoundationNew York, NY   $2,156,2626  Kevin J.

Note that this category includes public foundations founded by and for lGBTQ communities, as well as other public foundations and intermediaries that raise funds and award grants in a range of program areas. It also includes nonprofit organizations whose activities include awarding grants to other nonprofits.As in past years, lGBTQ funding from public funders was fairly evenly split between funders rooted in the lGBTQ  community and other funders. Specifically, lGBTQ public funders awarded nearly $15 million, and other public funders awarded more than $15 million. Overall, lGBTQ grantmaking by public funders increased by nearly 20 percent from  its $25.8 million total in 2011.About one-third of lGBTQ funding awarded by public funders consists of “re-grants” originally from private foundations and corporations, who sometimes work through public funders as intermediaries. 2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations48 Breakdown of Issues Addressed  by Public Funders2012 Public Fund Grant DollarsPercentage of Public Fund GrantmakingPercentage of all lGBTQ GrantmakingCivil Rights / Human Rights $13,976,510 47% 47%Health  $7,047,477 24% 16%Building Community, Families, and visibility $2,260,236 8% 13%Education  $2,654,378 9% 6%violence, Homophobia, and Transphobia  $2,226,604 7% 4%Economic Issues $472,417 2% 3%Other Issues  $1,265,672 4% 10%TOTAl $29,903,294    ISSUES ADDRESSED BY PUBlIC FUNDERSNearly half of the funding from public funds went to civil rights/human rights work, mirroring the overall picture of all LGBTQ  grantmaking.

All types of foundations were surveyed — private, public, community and corporate — as well as nonprofit organizations with grantmaking programs. Information was obtained predominantly through self-reporting by grantmakers, as well as a review of 990s and annual reports. Our overarching research goal was to ensure that the data we collected focused specifically on lGBTQ issues and orga-nizations. Therefore, the data does not include grants to organizations or projects that are generally inclusive of lGBTQ people unless they explicitly address an lGBTQ issue or population. For example, a women’s organization given a grant to develop a sex education curriculum for girls, open and welcoming to all girls, including lBTQ girls, would not have been included in the data. If that same organization was funded to provide sex education specifically to lBTQ girls, it would have been included. In a slight departure from our previous tracking reports, we have included all re-granting dollars in charts that rank indi-vidual grantmakers and the appendix to accurately show the overall level of lGBTQ funding provided by each grantmak-er, regardless of whether those dollars are provided in the form of direct grants or through an intermediary that then re-grants those dollars to other organizations and individuals. As a result, the charts that rank grantmakers and the appendix ”double-count” re-granting when aggregated. However, for all other tabulations and charts, we have not included dollars awarded for the purpose of regranting, so as to avoid double counting. ACKNOwlEDGMENTSOur heartfelt appreciation goes out to all the people who made this report possible, and particularly to our members and other foundations who took the time to provide us with data on their grantmaking for lGBTQ communities. Thanks also to the members of our board of directors, who offered early feedback on this new format. A very special thank-you to Andy lane, the chair of our board, who helped conceptualize the new structure for the tracking report and provided in-depth feedback and guidance throughout its development. 2012 TRACKING REPOR T Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Grantmaking by U.S. Foundations64Andrew lane, ChairDirector, Johnson Family FoundationCindy Rizzo, vice ChairVice President of Organizational Learning  and Grants Management, Arcus FoundationJesse King, TreasurerManaging Director, Fulcrum AdvisorsMitchell Singer, SecretarySenior Philanthropic Advisor, Rockefeller Philanthropy AdvisorsMaria CadenasPhilanthropy Advisor, Driscoll’sRebecca FoxProgram Officer, Wellspring AdvisorsMatthew “Matty” HartPresident of the Board of Directors, Calamus FoundationPatricia St. OngePartner, Seven Generations Consulting and CoachingKristine StalloneVice President for Finance and Administration,  American Jewish World ServiceNathaniel “Toby” ThompkinsVice President, Tides 21st CenturyBoard of DirectorsBen Francisco Maulbeck Presidentlyle Matthew Kan Director of Communications and EducationMarvin webb Director of Operations and Member ServicesKristina wertz Director of EngagementStaffAnalysis & writing:  Lyle Matthew Kan and Ben Francisco MaulbeckResearch:  Nancy Cunninghamlayout Design:  Tammy Collins, Evolve Visual DesignEditing:  Marvin WebbReport CreditsMISSIONFunders for lGBTQ Issues works to mobilize the philanthropic resources that enhance the well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities, promote equity and advance racial, economic and gender justice.Published December 2013 by Funders for LGBTQ Issues.Funders for lGBTQ Issues116 East 16th Street, 7th Floor  |  New York, NY 10003  |  Telephone: 212 . 475 . 2930  |  Fax: 212 . 475 . 2532 www.lgbtfunders.org  |  Twitter: @lgbtfunders  |  Facebook: www.facebook.com/LGBTQFunders",
