Gender and Education 15(2):pp. 151-168.  Copyright 2003 Taylor & Francis     The women’s movement in Canadian and Australian education: from liberation and sexism to boys and social justice  JANE GASKELL, University of British Columbia, Canada, & SANDRA TAYLOR,  Queensland University of Technology, Australia   Abstract  This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ways in which the women’s movement was able to effect change in educational policy and practice in Australia and Canada between 1970 and 2000, drawing on interviews and document analysis in both countries.  While the movement in both countries drew on similar international texts and conversations, it had more sustained state support in education in Australia.  Despite the different degrees of institutionalisation, similar trends emerged in both countries.  There was more public visibility for the movement in the 1970s and 80s than in the 90s, and a shift in discourse from ‘women’s liberation’ and ‘sexism’ to boys and social justice.  We argue that the movement continues to be a creative source of ideas and change even when it is less visible and less formally represented, and that differences in outcomes are not easily linked to differences in institutionalisation.  In both countries, major change has occurred, although the demands of the movement have not been realised.      2Introduction  The women’s movement, like other ‘new’ social movements, is an international phenomenon that takes different forms in different countries.  In the early 1970s the movement was galvanised by a new awareness of ‘sexism’ and demands for ‘women’s liberation’.  Feminist authors like Germaine Greer (Australian), Simone de Beauvoir (French), Betty Friedan (American), Maggie Benston (Canadian) and Juliet Mitchell (British) were discussed in many countries, and the women’s movement developed a powerful critique of educational institutions and practice.    Although it draws on international texts, networks and images, the movement works in particular ways in local settings.  It is not a unitary phenomenon, but a shifting coalition of networks and meanings that priories different issues and take different shapes in different places at different times.  In this paper, we focus on the contexts in which the women’s movement in Canada and Australia was able to affect educational policy and practice between 1970 and 2000.   While there were similarities between the two countries, there were also important differences in the complexion of governments in power, the organisation of teachers unions, the resources available to the movement and the sanctioning of knowledge by universities and curriculum departments.     The broad similarities start with energetic grass roots organising in the 1970s, which won some resources from the state, and support from some teachers’ unions.  Girls’ achievement and participation gradually increased; curriculum was revised; understandings of gender became more sophisticated.  But by the 1990s, the public visibility of the movement in both countries had diminished. Increased awareness of differences among women meant that women’s issues were subsumed under a broad umbrella of ‘social justice’ and the problems of boys dominated the headlines.  The more radical agenda of feminism languished.  The biggest difference between the two countries was in how the movement was connected to formal educational institutions.   Sawer (1991) writes ‘Since the 1970s, the Australian women’s movement has regained an international reputation for its success in imprinting its demands upon government - particularly in terms of sophisticated bureaucratic machinery ....  There is no equivalent in the USA or the UK, Canada or New Zealand’ (p.258). ‘Femocrats’ is an Australian term coined to describe the cohort of women who were appointed to government bureaucracies to work on advancing the position of women in the wider society through the development of equal opportunity and anti-discrimination strategies for change.  They were self-declared and publicly recognised feminists in senior bureaucratic positions.  Feminism was a qualification for these positions, and a necessity for the creation of such positions.  Eisenstein (1996, p. 53) comments that ‘education at all levels was the area where feminist women had perhaps the greatest access and the greatest influence’.  Yates (1999, p. 558) points out that in Australian education, ‘feminists who have engaged in radical critiques of the state are very likely to be consulted by one of its branches concerned with reform, and, at some point in their lives, to either be employed by the state to do feminist work or to receive some funding support for work they have begun themselves’.  As a result, ‘in few countries have feminist issues been heard so widely in education as they have in Australia, and initiatives, reforms and research produced in this country have been widely influential’ (Yates 1998, p. 84).   Ramsay (1997) has called for more comparative analysis of ‘the femocrat experiment’ in order to understand the conditions that underlay it, and the features which are distinctively Australian.   In Canada the state has been more reluctant to put in place a significant government apparatus to support women’s issues (Finlay 1987). The Canadian state instead provided funding for autonomous women’s groups, and even this funding was pulled back as the state restructured, a recession struck and significant opposition developed in the 1990s.    3This kind of comparative analysis engages the debate about the gains and losses of working closely with the state. In Canada, Brodie (1995) and in Australia, Eisenstein (1996) point out how state support helps in naming and addressing women’s issues.  But involvement with the state can also shape and divert the energy of the women’s movement (Dowse 1988; Finlay and Randall 1988; Franzway, Court and Connell 1989; Yeatman 1990).  These critics argue that the work of feminists in social policy areas becomes framed by the hard policies of financial management which work with the implicit goal of bringing the disadvantaged to the norm. As a result, Yeatman concludes that working within the state ‘has profoundly implicated femocrats in the various and distinctively Labor corporatist strategies of rolling back the welfare state in the 1980s’ (1990, p. 97).  She argues that a ‘politics of discourse’ which concentrates on making new claims, exploring differences and decoding the discourses of domination, is more appropriate for women than a state centred strategy.  Yeatman’s argument echoes work on the new social movements by Melucci (1996), who sees social movements as, most importantly, cultural forces, ‘disenchanted prophets’ who ‘speak before’ and are ‘deeply reticent’ about formal institutional politics.  He argues social movements introduce new ways of thinking about and living in the world, rather  than adapting themselves to current political forms. They are central in the construction of new meaning, which is ‘adapted, framed and reframed through public discourse, ... consciousness raising, political symbols and icons’ (Johnston and Klandermans 1995, p. 5).   In this paper, we explore how the women’s movement worked to change education in the two countries, examining the way in which context made a difference, and exploring the consequences for schooling and for the women’s movement.  Methodology  Canada and Australia are quite similar in formal ways. They share a British colonial past (though a quarter of Canadians say French is their mother tongue), an increasingly multicultural population (15% - 20% of the population of both countries does not speak an official language at home) and severely disadvantaged indigenous peoples (3% of population in Canada, 2% in Australia). Canada is a country of 30 million, while Australia is a country of 18 million.  Both have federal political systems, in which education is a state/provincial responsibility, and schools with unionised teachers and a state curriculum. But they differ in many particularities of their histories, culture and political institutions. Quebec’s nationalist claims have kept the federal government largely out of educational and cultural policy in Canada, while the federal state has increasingly had an impact on both in Australia.  The close proximity of the US has made American market-led political discourse more popular in Canada, while Australia continues to have closer political ties to Britain and its class-based politics and welfare state traditions. The small size of the private school sector and the existence of school boards has made local politics important for schooling in Canada, while a larger private sector and the absence of public school boards has made the public/private divide much more important for Australian education.  Because the educational system is a state or provincial responsibility in both countries, we have chosen to focus mainly on two states or provinces in each.  In Australia, we examine Queensland, which is the resource frontier, seen by the rest of the country as the ‘red-neck fringe’, and South Australia, where feminism has had a strong presence.  In Canada, we focus on British Columbia, which has a similar profile to Queensland, and Ontario, the most populous and powerful province where a women’s teachers union had an important impact.  This research is based on interviews and document analysis in Australia and Canada carried out between 1998 and 2000.  The Canadian interviews are with 25 feminists involved in educational issues in British Columbia and Ontario between 1970 and 2000.  In Australia, 20 feminists who had been ‘key players’ in  4the campaigns for gender equity in education in the 1970s and 1980s in Queensland and South Australia were interviewed.   The interviewees were chosen by taking names from the documents or from personal contacts, and then using a snowball sampling method.    The 1970s and 1980s: women’s liberation and the elimination of sexism in schooling  In 1970, women’s secondary status was clearly reflected in similar educational statistics in Canada and Australia.  Women were 36% of those enrolled in Canadian universities and 38% of those in Australian universities.  Women were 53% of the teaching force in British Columbia , and 57% of the teaching force in Australia (Goulden, Neuberger et al. 1973; [Australian] Schools Commission 1975).  They held 6% of the administrative positions in the school system in British Columbia, and were ‘rare’ as principals in Australia.  They held one of eleven positions on the British Columbia Teachers Federation (BCTF) executive and no positions on the council of the Queensland Teachers Union (QTU).  Only in South Australia, where a breakaway women’s teachers union had negotiated equal representation on the executive of the South Australian Institute of Teachers (SAIT), and in Ontario, where women elementary teachers had their own federation, were women teachers well represented in their own organisations.   Cultural norms that are less easily measurable were even more appalling.  Stereotypes of women with aprons predominated in early readers and textbooks; girls were channelled into home economics and out of mathematics and science; women teachers could not wear pants in their classrooms and employers questioned them about their marital status.  The list of grievances was a long one and in general terms it was similar in the two countries.  The response, however,  was shaped by differing contexts.  Canada  In 1970, a Royal Commission on the status of women in Canada produced a 300 page report, eliciting widespread discussion (Royal Commission on the Status of Women 1970).  The chapter on education pointed out that women were under-represented at the university, and in programs in science, mathematics and technology.  It recommended eliminating sexism in textbooks and in career counselling, and including more women as administrators.   This was liberal and pragmatic feminism, little influenced by the new women’s movement.  However, the report had an enormous effect on legitimising women’s issues, and it was followed, slowly, by some state action in relation to its recommendations (Finlay 1987).  Some women’s advisers were appointed and a (male) minister was given responsibility for women’s issues at the federal level.  Most importantly, the federal government began a program that provided grants for women’s groups across the country and for a National Action Committee on the Status of Women. These groups became the primary mechanism for taking the politics of women’s liberation into the public arena.    There were few Canada-wide initiatives in education, where  the federal government had no jurisdiction.   The Canadian Teachers Federation organised a few conferences on the status of women in education and commissioned research and position papers on mothers and teachers, on adolescent girls and on technology.  Feminist ideas about education were also spread through universities, conferences and books (Forman et. al., 1990; Gaskell, McLaren and Novogrodsky, 1989; Gaskell and McLaren, 1987) as networks developed.    Most of the work took place on a provincial level.   In British Columbia, status of women groups with federal funding developed community networks and set up offices in centres around the province.  Education figured prominently in their newsletters  and their committee structures.  A Vancouver group called ‘women in teaching’ pressured the teachers’ union (BCTF) to appoint a task force on women’s issues in 1971. This task force brought together the politics of women’s liberation with the language of the Royal Commission, as this comment from a task force member illustrates:    5The task force was a combination of consciousness-raising group and a task-oriented group.  We would start every meeting basically debriefing about our private lives and what we were going through with our respective husbands, and how unhappy we were, and how little was changing, and on and on. . . .  We would beat up for about an hour or something and then we took the Royal Commission Report and we started work.   Their report was accepted by the teachers’ union, after a raucous meeting, and a full time adviser on the status of women was appointed.  She drew feminist teachers together from across the province.  Trying to get more women into administration was deliberately downplayed in favour of spreading women’s movement ideas.   Her first year report states:  ‘[The committee] has remained a grassroots network that has raised the consciousness of many teachers regarding the importance of social responsibility within the BCTF.’    In 1972, a social democratic provincial government was elected with strong support from the teachers’ federation. The new Minister of Education appointed an adviser on sex discrimination in education, who selected an advisory committee composed of women’s movement activists and worked closely with the teachers’ status of women program.  This committee again had a great deal of autonomy and defined itself as part of the women’s movement, much to the consternation of the bureaucracy.  As one member reflected later, ‘We got a lot more mileage by being very brash and embarrassing at times.  Just putting people on the spot’.  They ran workshops for students and teachers, produced guidelines for screening curriculum materials, wrote new curriculum materials, developed a women’s studies course with help from faculty members at the university, and networked among educators across the province.  This was a moment when the movement had great success getting some of its most radical ideas on the educational agenda, drawing on the resources of the state and the union.  Consciousness, ideas and networking were the focus.  The moment was, however, relatively short lived.  In 1975, the social democratic government was defeated by a right wing government, and the new Minister of Education stated that he no longer needed an adviser on sex discrimination since there was no discrimination against women.     Opposition to the status of women committee’s activities also began to surface in the teachers’ federation as the politics of the province moved to the right.  In 1977, a motion to have the program ‘umbrella-ed’ (combined with other human rights programs) was described as an attempt ‘to weaken us, to confuse the issues, to diffuse our strength’ (Goldberg 1995, p. 186).  The motion was defeated at the annual meeting, but the committee gradually lost autonomy, budget and the right to choose its own members.   It was drawn more fully into the institutional politics of the union, and distanced from its movement  roots.  When it objected to segregated physical education and supported abortion rights, it was perceived as too radical even by its leftist allies.  By 1981, over half the BCTF executive was female, and a motion on abortion had been passed, but women in the movement saw their issues and their power slipping away.     In Ontario, a much larger and wealthier province, the women’s movement in education the early 1970s included many new women’s liberation groups as well as an older group of women’s rights reformers who had been behind the Royal Commission. The government from 1971 to 1985, was Conservative and centrist.  The teachers were represented by five different unions, one of which was the Federation of Women Teachers Associations of Ontario.  This led to several different centres of pressure for change.    Women in the civil service pushed the Ministry of Education to reform curriculum.  In 1976, the Ministry published a resource guide entitled, Sex-Role Stereotyping and Women's Studies ‘to assist educators in the on-going task of developing a learning environment that is free from sex role stereotyping of males and females and curriculum that accurately depicts the roles of women’.  It also convened a curriculum conference to launch the document, creating networks among educators trying to rethink the teaching of  6everything from history to English, to physical education, to reading.  In 1976, the primary curriculum was revamped with more emphasis on the equality of girls.  In 1984, the new secondary curriculum guidelines included language around ‘sex equity’.  Provincial curriculum processes and finances were fairly decentralised to school boards in Ontario.  Boards could raise funds from local taxes, write curriculum documents and develop  policy and organise professional development.  The school board in Toronto, Ontario’s largest city, was the most progressive.  It elected trustees on a left wing slate, and they supported two advisors on women’s equality, and equity projects of all kinds.  One women’s advisor comments,  I had quite generous funding.  I had a lot of political support.  I had a community base that was pushing for some important feminist changes in the schools.  I had (a good colleague) and a big advisory committee of women who met with us about once a month.  We would usually go and drink wine and really talk about, like, how far can we take this stuff?  The Federation of Women Teachers Associations of Ontario (FWTAO) was a different kind of site for feminist action.  The Federation had been founded in a ‘wave of euphoria’ after women received the right to vote in 1918 (Shackleton 1968). It was the largest teachers’ federation in the province and it worked with organisations like the Business and Professional Women and the University Women’s Club to lobby for policy and legislation that would advance the cause of women.   Throughout the 1970s, FWTAO organised conferences, films, workshops and newsletters around women’s equality.  It prepared briefs and position papers on child abuse, violence, poverty, racism and the integration of children with special needs. It published critiques of sexism in the curriculum, developed new curriculum and ran career days for students.   I think the big thing was we had money.  We had the whole fee and we spent it all on women.  So we were able to produce curriculum materials, documents about affirmative action, and briefs on every subject under the sun.  The FWTAO was not entirely comfortable with the more radical elements of the women’s movement, and it came slowly to unionism.  They strongly supported women who wanted to move into administration.  One staff member commented that,  We didn’t have much truck with the new Women’s Movement….it had a self-indulgent side where they would sit around in encounter groups moaning about their husbands and not doing ANYTHING…They alienated the public.…They also caused divisions among people.    Coalition building was however the order of the day.  FWTAO mounted campaigns for pregnancy benefits and maternity leave, abortion, rights for part time teachers, affirmative action and pay equity legislation. By 1990, they won 43 million dollars for women teachers who were in the lowest salary categories because of their qualifications.  Educators throughout Ontario were introduced to radical feminist critique at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE). OISE was a graduate school in education, with a mandate to do outreach and it hired a substantial contingent of feminists.  One teacher describes her experience as a student:  So I went from this conservative, Catholic school board to this violence against women class.  The first day it was just like I had gotten run over by a truck, in terms of the impact.  But it worked for me.  It was a place where, all of a sudden, I was able to think about and articulate so many of the issues that I had always had.  Although it was hard in some ways.  It was such a transition.   7OISE courses provided an initial meeting point for those who developed the ‘Women’s Kit’, a collection of photos, documents and classroom activities for teachers, in 1974.  It was a resource for the ministry officials who wanted to rewrite curriculum documents.  It provided researchers for teachers unions documenting sexism in the system.  These community connections in turn legitimised feminist academics at OISE.  In Canada, then, a Royal Commission led to funding for women’s groups and raised the profile of the movement’s critique of education.  The radical discursive politics of the women’s movement in education got support where and when it could.  A few educational institutions provided space and resources: the teachers’ union and a short-lived social democratic government in British Columbia; a women teachers’ federation, a progressive school board and a research institute in Ontario.  Overall, the movement’s relationship with mainstream institutions in education was unstable and short lived, but it had an impact.    Australia  In Australia, women’s liberation groups were ‘local in organisation, urban in setting and extremely varied’ (Ward 1998, p. 524).  Educational issues were part of the agenda, and many women involved were teachers.  In the early 1970s, the Australian Women’s Education Coalition (AWEC) formed to lobby for policies to improve the education of women and girls.  It produced a newsletter - ‘Bluestocking’ - and organised national conferences.  ‘Bluestocking’ reflected the mixture of radical cultural politics and liberal reformist agendas of the women’s movement at that time, and included articles on: ‘Women’s learning centres’, ‘Gay teachers and students’, ‘Making curriculum relevant for girls’; and ‘Men against sexism’.  This educational network was important in linking feminist educators and developing feminist thought in education across the country.   The election of the reformist Whitlam Labor federal government in 1972 signalled the beginning of government action on women’s issues.  The government hired its first ‘femocrat’ as Women’s Adviser to the Prime Minister.  Her relations with the women’s movement, as well as with the government, were rocky (Eisenstein 1996, Summers 2000).  In 1973, a newly appointed federal Schools Commission took up equality as a major theme and defined girls as a ‘disadvantaged’ group needing special attention.  Its comprehensive and groundbreaking report - Girls, School and Society (Schools Commission 1975) - examined ‘the extent of underachievement by women and girls in education and its contribution to the inferior status of women’ (p. 1). The role of the ‘new feminism’ in raising questions about the education of girls is mentioned and several well known feminists were involved in the report - as members of the Committee, or as research assistants or consultants.  While its explanatory framework rested largely on sex-role socialisation, and its approach was to bring women to a male norm, it was broad in scope and included a chapter on ‘Groups with special needs’, where migrant, Aboriginal, and country girls and women were discussed. The report articulated and legitimated women’s movement ideas in schools:  ‘Policies were important because ... what we actually wanted was ... something to validate what we were saying in schools. ...  We could actually do the things we were doing with a piece of paper to say it’s OK.’   The UN International Women’s Year in 1975 brought funding for women’s advisers in state teachers’ unions, and money for conferences and research.  When the Whitlam government was defeated by the Fraser Liberal government in 1975, women’s issues were given a lower priority and federal programs were cut back, but they were not eliminated.  During this period, although federal funding for women’s services decreased, ‘Labor governments in the states picked up the slack’ (Eisenstein, 1996, p. 31).  In 1982 a Working Party on the Education of Girls was established, and with the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983, their report, Girls and Tomorrow (Commonwealth Schools Commission 1984), put gender issues back more firmly on the agenda.  This report reviewed progress, and suggested priorities  8for action, including the development of a national policy in the area.  The report argued that: ‘Women have the potential to contribute significantly to economic recovery.  Their earnings are often crucial to the economic security of their families and are essential to strengthening consumer demand’ (Commonwealth Schools Commission 1984, p. 7).  Feminist academics were well represented on the Working Party, and at a national seminar convened to contribute to the development of the report.  The government sought to increase the Commonwealth’s influence over education ‘in the national interest’ (Lingard and Porter 1997).  Susan Ryan, who was Minister for Education at the time, was a feminist and former teacher who had been a member of the committee that produced Girls School and Society over a decade earlier.  In 1987, the federal government and all the states agreed to A National Policy for the Education of Girls in Australian Schools (Commonwealth Schools Commission 1987).  The policy had four key objectives: raising awareness of the educational needs of girls; equal access to and participation in appropriate curriculum; provision of a supportive school environment, and; equitable resource allocation.  It tended towards liberal feminism, emphasising the access of girls to existing forms of education (Kenway, 1990; Yates, 1993), but included discourses that dealt with sexuality and sexual harassment, affirmed female culture and experiences and introduced a critical view of the education of boys (Taylor, Lingard, Rizvi and Henry, 1997).  Although the federal government had an important role in Australia in developing and legitimising a feminist critique in education, and funding equity initiatives, state governments were responsible for what went on ‘on the ground’.  There were substantial differences between South Australia and Queensland.  A progressive Labor state government, committed to women’s rights,  was elected in South Australia in 1970 and remained in power until 1979.  It developed a Sex Discrimination Act in 1975, and was the first state government to appoint ‘femocrats.’   Bradley, describes South Australia’s Education Department as a model for how femocrats transformed the bureaucracy:  ‘Things will never be the same in that department … There are loads of women in senior positions and they’re very clear about what they are doing … They know they should be running the department, and to a large extent they are (Eistenstein 1996, p. 54).  Feminists in the department worked with feminist teachers and academics to bring about change in curriculum materials, professional development and classroom practices.   Liberal as well as Labor governments continued to support initiatives to improve the education of girls.  A formal policy, ‘Equal Opportunities: the Education of Girls in Government Schools’ was adopted 1983.    Women teachers had achieved equal representation on the executive and in all committees of the South Australian teachers’ union (SAIT) in 1951.  Women’s liberation activists formed a sexism committee in the early 1970s, and fought for the appointment of a federally funded women’s officer.  Once appointed, the SAIT Women’s Officer organised a network of teachers across the state with contacts for newsletters and other information in every school. She also formed a network with her counterparts in other states.    There was close collaboration between the Women’s Officer in SAIT and the Women’s Officer in the education department through the 1970s and 1980s, as well as between these women and the women’s movement.  As one activist put it:  ‘The feminist bureaucrats were dependent on the women’s movement to press for change, and the women’s movement relied on them to put things through’.  The women ‘were all from the same activist group’.  There were, however, some tensions when the femocrats had to promote ‘winnable issues’ such as career education for girls, rather than more radical issues (Eisenstein 1996, pp. 77-8).  Priorities were professional development and the development of non-sexist resource materials.  A Women’s Studies Resource Centre was set up in Adelaide by feminists, most of whom were teachers with strong links with the unions.  They sent out boxes of non-sexist resources to teachers in the country.   9In Queensland, in contrast, the ultra conservative state government during the 1970s and 80s refused to provide funding for projects or make appointments to address gender equity issues in education.  The government’s position, like that of the Social Credit government in British Columbia, was that such initiatives were not necessary because there was ‘no sexism in Queensland education’.  However, pressure from the federal government and from unions kept women’s issues alive.  A minimalist policy statement: ‘Equality of Opportunity in Education for Girls and Boys’ was developed in 1981 in order to access federal government funds.  This policy refers even-handedly to ‘girls and boys’ or ‘all students’ throughout, with no acknowledgment of specific issues facing girls in education.  Despite the government’s stance, some strategic ‘under cover’ gender equity work in relation to curriculum development and professional took place in the department using federal funding (Lingard, Henry and Taylor 1987).    Women activists also encountered more hostility in union politics in Queensland than in South Australia.  The QTU was one of the few teachers’ unions that failed to provide funding to continue a women’s officer position when federal funding ended.  Although there was reasonable support for non-sexist education in the QTU, male unionists were hostile to any issues that concerned the position of women teachers: ‘It was clearly about power and power sharing.  It came down to that - they didn’t want to share power’.  Opponents to the push for women’s representation said that the women were dividing the union by pushing for such issues, and that men could represent women’s issues well enough.   A resource centre was set up by the union in the early 1980s.  When federal funds were used to develop non-sexist curriculum materials for teachers, the state government refused to provide funds to distribute the materials that had been printed.  ‘They were never officially released, but the QTU Women’s Officer photocopied the material and distributed it to schools’ - demonstrating collaboration between feminists in the unions and in the bureaucracy.   University based feminists were active in supporting these initiatives.  Feminists in the QTU and the Queensland Association for Teachers in Independent Schools (QATIS) also collaborated to set up a professional association - the Association of Women Educators (AWE) - in order to access state funding for professional development in the early 1980s.  There had been hostility between these two unions over private school funding issues (a 'hot' issue in Australia), but over women’s issues there was collaboration.  The AWE appointed a coordinator to organise workshops for teachers around the state on girls’ self esteem, classroom interaction and non-sexist curriculum.  Activities were organised in some country towns where the whole school population would attend, and meetings were organised with parent groups and the conservative Country Women's Association.    In the 1970s and 80s, the institutionalisation of the women’s movement in the federal government in Australia played an important role in providing funding and a policy framework for educational initiatives to improve the status of women.  Policy documents put feminist discourses on the agenda of the educational system, though they were framed within an equal opportunity framework and gave relatively little space to the more radical agenda of feminisms.  The much more supportive political context in South Australia resulted in strong collaborative alliances between the teacher unionists and the femocrats, and the ability to make maximum use of federal funds.  In Queensland, feminist work went on in a more subterranean way.   Summary  In the 1970s and early 80s, progressive unions, left leaning governments and feminist academics were important in producing resources and legitimacy for the women’s movement  in education.  Institutional support was stronger in Australia than in Canada. However, in both countries, the opportunity structure was  10defined not simply by the state, but by other organisations in civil society, particularly unions, women’s groups and universities.  The public face of the movement was shaped by the institutions where it found support.  Governments in Australia privileged equal rights feminism, while providing some space for expanding what that might mean.  Collaboration with femocrats in educational ministries meant a priority on policy and curriculum development.   In Canada, union issues took priority after an initial flurry of interest in revising curriculum guidelines, because unions provided more ongoing support for the movement.  The greater involvement of academics in Australia placed feminist discourses in policy guidelines, while in Canada, academic feminism had an indirect effect through graduate courses and newsletters.     Reformulating issues in the 1990s: violence, social justice and boys  By the end of the 1980s, in both countries, the women’s movement had made an impact, and things had changed, both in the movement and in the educational system.  ‘Women’s liberation’ had gradually become feminism, and the focus on women as a single group gave way to the recognition of differences among women.  In both Canada and Australia, the representation of women in educational organisations had increased and more educators were aware of what gender equity entailed for their practice. But the women’s movement was losing its visibility on the public agenda, as attention turned to issues of difference - particularly relating to race and sexuality.  Rather than having programs targeted at women, gender issues were ‘mainstreamed’ ‘umbrella-ed’, and through ‘broadbanding’ linked with other equity issues in a broader social justice approach (Taylor and Henry 2000).  Further, questions about boys were increasingly raised and debated in the media.  Canada  In the 1990s, women’s issues were mentioned in a few Canada wide reports on the economy, and in a formal statement by the Council of Ministers of Education, reflecting increased acceptance by government and business of women’s equality issues. But most discussion of educational policy focussed on national competitiveness and standards.  Teachers’ unions dropped the discussion of gender in favour of fighting cutbacks and business agendas.  It was a right wing research institute that got headlines about gender equity in education, arguing that boys were discriminated against in schools.    But again, provincial differences were important.  In British Columbia, a Royal Commission on Education (Sullivan 1988) created new space for women’s issues in education.  The new social democratic (NDP) government designated the senior woman in the Ministry of Education as women’s adviser, and hired a staff officer who had been part of the women’s movement since the early 1970s.  A gender equity advisory committee representing the superintendents, the school trustees, the principals, the teachers, the faculties of education and, eventually, the students, was struck to provide advice.     This committee was more fully integrated into the ministry than the equivalent committee in the 1970s.  It included women with a sophisticated awareness of differences in feminism and women new to feminist ideas.  The group argued over definitions of gender equity, a discussion which some found ‘tiresome’ while others found it ‘really educational’.  Although there was sympathy at higher levels in the ministry for the issues mentioned by the Commission - better counselling for young women, less gender stereotyping in curriculum, more women in management positions, and flexible working conditions for women teachers - neither the bureaucracy nor the minister was sympathetic to a wide ranging discussion of gender and a feminist critique of schools.    11The more radical questions, asked in the 1970s, and still part of the agenda of feminists on the committee, about ‘What is science?’ and ‘Whose science is it?’... They still don't get it ... They really don't get the idea that [taking a feminist approach] is really a different way of doing things and a different way of being in the world.  Small grants were given to school boards and groups of teachers for gender equity projects, and province wide conferences were held for three years, but the interventions did not become systematic or systemic.  The resources allocated within the ministry remained small and contested.  Most school districts have anti-harassment policies, they've got multiculturalism policies, and teachers don't even know they exist and students certainly don't know they exist.    The work produced a greater awareness of sexual harassment, a more egalitarian approach to management, a checklist for the learning resources branch and, after ‘pulling teeth’, more discussion of women in the history curriculum. However, the staff officer left in 1994 and the advisory committee was disbanded.  The ministry moved on to concerns about the underperformance of boys and violence in schools.   In the BCTF, the status of women committee was struggling as the government reorganised the profession and created a College of Teachers.  The coordinator’s role was shared among ten staff people.  The committee was accused of not reaching classroom teachers, of talking to the converted, and not being responsive.  ‘So in the 1990s it limped along, limped along, limped along, and things weren't happening.’  In 1997, it was disbanded and became part of  a social justice umbrella including  gender equity, antiracism, violence prevention, combating heterosexism and homophobia, and First Nations. The program supports a variety of initiatives, from teachers’ unions in South America, to conferences for teenage women, to anti-violence initiatives and workshops on poverty and homophobia.  Women’s activists were ‘appalled’ at the change, but as one staff person pointed out,  ... if we asked [our members] whether the BCTF should be involved in social responsibility and social justice, I think 70-80% of them would say, ‘No!’  At the same time, they're calling us to say, ‘I've got these hungry kids in my classroom, I've got fights going on, I've got gay bashing’.  But they don't make that connection.    In Ontario, a 1993 Royal Commission on Learning, (Ontario Royal Commission on Learning 1993) for which Monique Begin, executive assistant on the Royal Commission on the Status of Women thirty years earlier, was one of two commissioners contained no recommendations about women, although it put a substantial focus on race and ethnic diversity. One women activist comments:  We put our case forward, we had all done briefs in various ways, there were all these issues confronting girls.  (The Royal Commission on Learning) had 167 recommendations and not one of them addressed women.  What did the minister have to say?  He leaned across the table, and he said, ‘I will tell you what I want to know.  I want to know why the boys don’t read as well as the girls’.    In 1995, a conservative Ontario government repealed much of the equal pay and affirmative action legislation, further cut funding to the system, centralised governance and forced new kinds of accountability. The Toronto Board, formerly a site of activity around gender and social justice, was amalgamated with suburban boards, and lost its staff and resources.  At the provincial ministry, gender equity was no longer mentioned.   The teachers turned their resources and energy to fighting the government.   Women’s issues were barely visible and narrowly defined.    12We are not involved in whether or not we have gender bias language in textbooks ...  Sometimes our members think that is what we should be doing.  But as a union that is not our focus. We don’t do curriculum.  We focus on protection.  The Federation of Women Teachers reluctantly amalgamated with the male elementary teachers’ organisation, much to the chagrin of the active feminists, because of continuing legal challenges to its existence under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Ironically, women’s groups had led the charge to have gender included as prohibited grounds for discrimination under the Charter. The constitution of the new federation guaranteed positions for women on the executive, and funding for women’s programs.  Staff continued to go on marches, support a gay, bisexual, transgender youth conference, produce anti-sexist, anti-racist curriculum, fund anti-poverty and women’s organisations and put out a status of women newsletter.  The amalgamation, however, changed the atmosphere and increased the opposition to these equity commitments.  As one staff member put it, ‘In FW what we experienced was a real resistance to raising issues of homophobia or racism.  That is where we got the hate mail.  Now, hate mail comes around gender’.   Everything we have is fragile. I think we are doing marvellous job of holding on to the beliefs and the structures and the policies and continuing to do the work in the new structure, it feels more precarious to me than FW did, and FW vanished entirely.  And the employment equity act vanished entirely.  The experience of the world in the last few years has been an experience of loss for the things that we have all worked for.  In Canada, then, a more sophisticated awareness of what feminism meant for schools was not reflected in either the governance of education or the work of teachers’ unions in the 1990s.  The women’s movement’s analysis of difference was increasingly at odds with the dominant educational discourses and the institutional support that had been forthcoming was dramatically cut back.    Australia  Economic rationalism also dominated education policy agendas in Australia in the 1990s although policy about gender equity remained in place in state education departments and nationally.  Programs for equity groups suffered cutbacks in funding, some gender equity units were dismantled and programs were 'mainstreamed'.  The focus changed from equal opportunity for girls to gender equity - with an increasing emphasis on boys.  A review of The National Policy for the Education of Girls was conducted in 1992 by the Australian Education Council (AEC) - comprised of federal and state education ministers and representatives of government authorities.  The review affirmed the continuing relevance of the policy, developed new priority areas, and outlined an implementation plan (AEC 1993).  The first priority - ‘examining the construction of gender’ - signalled a shift in terminology.  The second priority was eliminating sex-based harassment - defined as including sexist harassment, sexual harassment and gender-based harassment.  There was also a focus on ‘improving the outcomes of girls who benefit least from schooling; and addressing the needs of girls at risk’ (AEC 1993).    Gender Equity: A framework for Australian schools (Gender Equity Taskforce 1996) further shifted the focus from the ‘education of girls’ to ‘gender equity’ and a concern about the education of boys.  The document’s consistent inclusion of ‘girls and boys’ ‘conveys the impression that there is no systematic advantage or disadvantage to any group on any of the issues’ (Daws 1997, p. 104), even on questions of  13violence.  The framework emphasises that ‘development of understanding about gender construction should include knowledge about the intersection of gender and other factors, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, SES, ethnicity, isolation, disability, cultural background, religion and sexuality’ (Gender Equity Taskforce 1996).  A diverse range of projects were funded under the Gender Equity Framework - from projects which documented post-school outcomes by gender, to the Gender and Violence Project which produced kits for primary and secondary schools.  The situation worsened considerably when the conservative Howard federal government was elected in 1996.  The position of Sex Discrimination Commissioner went unfilled for a year, funds were cut to women’s organisations and initiatives to assist the education of girls and women were reduced.  For example, the federal department stopped publishing The GEN (Gender Equity Network), a monthly newsletter provided free of cost to schools which included case studies of gender reform in schools and information about recent resources.  Industrial issues, such as teachers’ pay, and public education, became the priorities of most teachers’ unions.  In this difficult environment the Australian Education Union (AEU) was attempting to put gender issues on education agendas again and developed a new action plan (AEU 1998).  The AEU’s Women’s Officer explained: ‘if the systems won’t do work in this area, the union will’, but was careful that any initiatives not be perceived as ‘anti-male’.    Networking continued to allow women’s’ groups to remain in touch and lobby at the national level; for example, over issues such as the gender equity unit in the Northern Territory being dismantled, and the threatened loss of funding for the Women’s Studies Resource Centre in South Australia.  In South Australia, Labor and Liberal governments continued to support gender equity policies. In 1991 its revised policy, ‘Education of Girls Three Year Action Plan’ kept a focus on ‘girls’ rather than ‘gender equity’.  The Education of Girls Unit remained in place, focussing on girls within a broader equity framework, with an emphasis on particular groups like those in poverty and those not speaking English.   But as elsewhere, the issues around the education of boys were being raised.     New South Wales had held a major inquiry into the education of boys, and the federal government researched the problems of boys and literacy.  This meant that feminist strategies became defensive in nature - 'holding the line ' against further attacks on special programs for girls.  Moreover, one activist pointed out that staff in gender equity units did not have links to the grass roots women’s movement and had become much more 'liberal' in their approach:  I think they came from within the system rather than from without.  Their politics came from ...  becoming aware of the education of girls from being within the system - and it carried with it no notion of 'This is a political fight from without, that you fight from within as well'. … They didn't have two worlds...  Union activists and women in the state government no longer shared a set of texts or a consciousness, as one union activist points out.  ... in the past when you ... worked with people doing ‘education of girls’ stuff, many of them actually came with some good theoretical understandings of what the issues were about, had done some reading … most of them had a feminist perspective on what they were doing.  Whereas I think that’s changed ... they’re much more conservative, they have no understandings at all ... or very little understandings  ... about feminism or what the feminist struggle has been about.    14In Queensland, the election of a new Labor government in 1989 meant the state finally endorsed the national policy, set up a departmental Gender Equity Unit, and appointed staff.  The underground grass roots activity became the foundation for action.  In 1990 a ministerial advisory committee worked on a new policy - ‘Gender equity in education’, issued in 1992.  It tackled sexual harassment, and developed position papers on topics which included school uniforms, discipline policies, and pregnant schoolgirls.    The Association of Women Educators (AWE) continued to support gender equity work in the Education Department, producing a journal, Redress, organising conferences, meetings, and promotion training workshops for women teachers.  Its focus remained getting women into positions of power rather than implementing a radical women’s agenda, though it produced publications on sexuality and pregnant schoolgirls.  The collective voice for change which built up among the feminist activists in the 1970s and 1980s dissipated in the 1990s, despite the continuation of national policymaking on gender equity and the creation of a new set of femocrat positions in the Queensland state government.  The movement matured, splintered and tried to deal with diversity and the ‘What about the boys?’ debates, as a rightward drift in ideology took over public discourse.  Summary  During the 1990s, in both Canada and Australia, increasing attention was given in feminism to how class, race, ethnicity, disability and sexuality impact on gender issues, but the women’s movement had less of a public presence and gender issues were increasingly marginalised in education.  In both countries the opportunity structure collapsed - with changing global economic influences and conservative ideologies.  Even with progressive social democratic governments in Canberra, Ontario and British Columbia, the more developed politics of the women’s movement was sidelined.  Teacher unions took on new industrial priorities in response to economic and political restructuring.  Attention turned to the education of boys as the ‘new disadvantaged’ - in part the result of a backlash to feminist gains in education.    In Australia, the links between the women’s movement and the bureaucracy weakened, but the language of the policy reflected struggles over the politics of discourse and developments in feminist theory.  In Canada, on the other hand, equal opportunity feminism was the only discourse that governments would take into account, and even this tended to focus on boys.  Conclusions  This paper has highlighted the similarities and differences in the form and activities of the women’s movement in education in Australia and Canada. Our analysis confirms that ‘state feminism’ (Sawer 1991) - or ‘institutionalised feminism’ (Lake 1999) - was more far reaching and lasted longer in Australia than in Canada.  Federal government presence in education in Australia, with two periods of supportive Labor governments in Canberra, meant that the federal government set up ‘specialised bureaucratic machinery’ (Sawer 1991, p. 260) and developed policy around women in education in a way that was quite unknown in Canada.  Feminists, including feminist academics and teachers, were centrally involved in these developments and ensured that theoretical debates within feminism were reflected in policy developments in education.  Over time this policy thrust bound the states, even as the language of policy became narrower and more economically focussed.  A constant critique and discussion of the developments was heard in women’s movement circles.  In Canada, on the other hand, the absence of a federal presence in education, and the short tenure of reformist provincial governments in the 1970s and 80s, meant that state feminism in education was short  15lived.  Debates about policy focussed on textbooks and curriculum in the early 70s, and then died. They never became Canada wide in scope and they never created the networks of feminist debate and support that policy development fostered in Australia.  As a result, the women’s movement had to affect education from distinct pockets of resistance, mostly outside the formal institutional frameworks of the state, in unions, community groups and universities.    During the 1990s, similar trends were evident in both countries.  The women’s movement occupied less public space, teacher unions took on industrial priorities, and gender equity issues in education were ‘mainstreamed’ and ‘broadbanded’.  In both countries, feminism paid more attention to ‘difference’, while educational institutions as well as the media still defined gender issues as meaning the same results for boys and girls.  As a consequence, attention turned to the education of boys and to other groups, notably indigenous people and cultural and linguistic minorities, where participation and achievement lagged.  In the mid 1990s Eisenstein (1996) feared the ‘end of an era’ of state feminism in Australia.  However, many femocrat positions remain, and Queensland created new feminist structures in the 1990s.  As Ramsay (1997) points out ‘while each of them is now being challenged and to some extent dismantled they have by no means been eliminated’ (p. 487).  The women’s agenda failed to regain much state support in Canada, even when Royal Commission reports and social democratic governments might have provided an opening.    The story could be interpreted as a one of gains and then losses for the women’s movement, or as one of greater gains in Australia.  But the question of what counts as progress is not straightforward.    As Gelb and Hart (1999) point out, there is no simple cause and effect by which movement structures and processes determine outcomes.  The women’s movement itself has been bent on opening up new questions about what would count as progress, and for whom (Yates 1998).  There is little evidence that girls in school are worse off in Canada or that the participation of women and girls in education has slowed in the past ten years.  Currently 58% of university graduates in Canada, and 57% in Australia are women; 33% of school principals in British Columbia and 30% in Queensland are women.  Teachers unions in both countries have a strong participation of women in leadership positions.  While it is harder to evaluate the impact of the women’s movement on educational discourse and climate, our experience does not suggest that things are systematically worse in Canadian schools.  The women’s movement has an impact from the margins, even when it is not part of the state, as the literature on new social movements emphasises and as the example of Canada makes clear.  Social movements are located in everyday life - ‘in civil society or the life world rather than the economy’ (Lovenduski and Randall 1993) - and are about broad cultural change as well as political change.  A social movement that loses visibility is still developing and experimenting, and this makes these movements a rich source of system innovation and development (Yeatman 1994, p. 114-15). Social movements are tenuous and fluid grassroots coalitions, which form around shared concerns.  They are flexible and plural networks, which contest forms of domination in society, ‘the effect of which is to make power visible and accountable within the public space opened up by this contestation.  The decision-makers absorb this contestation within policies which take up as well as neutralise the challenge’ (Yeatman 1994, p. 115).  Through this lens, the patterns we have documented are to be expected - they reflect how social movements ‘work’ in relation to social change, taking up public space, then losing it and continuing ‘underground’.  While they are affected by institutional support, they are not dependent on it.  How they will be sponsored and find support in the institutional politics of education over the next decade is unclear, but they will continue to matter and to bear watching by researchers in different countries.   16Acknowledgements We would like to thank Catherine Marshall for getting us started with a grant from the Pacific Basin Research Center, USA; QUT for supporting Jane Gaskell as a visiting scholar for three months; SSHRC for a grant to support data gathering in Canada.

    "abstract": "This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ways in which the women’s movement was able to effect change in educational policy and practice in Australia and Canada between 1970 and 2000, drawing on interviews and document analysis in both countries. While the movement in both countries drew on similar international texts and conversations, it had more sustained state support in education in Australia. Despite the different degrees of institutionalisation, similar trends emerged in both countries. There was more public visibility for the movement in the 1970s and 80s than in the 90s, and a shift in discourse from ‘women’s liberation’ and ‘sexism’ to boys and social justice. We argue that the movement continues to be a creative source of ideas and change even when it is less visible and less formally represented, and that differences in outcomes are not easily linked to differences in institutionalisation. In both countries, major change has occurred, although the demands of the movement have not been realised",
