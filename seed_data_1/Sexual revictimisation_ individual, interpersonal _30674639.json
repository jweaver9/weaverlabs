Although prevalence \nis difficult to ascertain, several studies relate that people who have been sexually abused as \nchildren are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/\nor adulthood. Much of the literature on sexual revictimisation focuses on the individual risk \nfactors for the victim/survivor—their risk perception and emotional dysregulation resulting \nfrom initial sexual victimisation—and how these create vulnerability for sexual revictimisation. \nBroader contextual factors beyond the victim/survivor, however, are often ignored. These \ncontextual factors are explored here with a particular emphasis on minority groups, such as \npeople with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people. This focus \ndemonstrates that individual risk factors often do not account for how perpetrators may target \nvulnerable people who have previously been victimised, how community and organisational \nattitudes and norms may support sexual revictimisation, and how broader social norms create \nvulnerability for certain groups. A focus on these broader contextual factors helps to inform \nprevention strategies.\n  People who are sexually abused in childhood are two to three times more likely to be sexually \nrevictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood.\n  Individual risk factors include a history of child sexual abuse, poor risk perception, emotional \ndysregulation, cumulative past abuse, family conflict and distress.\n  Broader contextual factors, such as perpetrator tactics, community and organisational \nattitudes, and social norms, are also risk factors for sexual revictimisation.\nKEY MESSAGES\n© Commonwealth of Australia 2014\nWith the exception of AIFS branding, the Commonwealth Coat of Arms, \ncontent provided by third parties, and any material protected by a \ntrademark, all textual material presented in this publication is provided \nunder a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia licence (CC BY 3.0) \n<creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au>.

However, there is very little literature available that \nbrings together all the contextual factors related to sexual revictimisation. Data can be difficult \nto collate on minority or vulnerable groups who might best be described as falling through \nthe gaps between services and justice mechanisms. This is particularly true of gay, lesbian and \nbisexual people, Indigenous people and people with a disability.\nThe interpersonal and contextual factors related to sexual revictimisation will be explored in \nthis paper. The discussion begins with a look at what is known about the prevalence of sexual \nrevictimisation and the associated risk factors, specifically for heterosexual populations, and \nthen for the minority or vulnerable populations outlined above.\nThe prevalence of sexual revictimisation\nThe prevalence rates for sexual revictimisation are worryingly high for both men and women \nwho have experienced child sexual abuse; they are two to three times more likely to experience \nsubsequent abuse in adolescence or adulthood. This statistic is certainly supported by several \nstudies, some of which are outlined below (Chiu et al., 2013; Classen et al., 2005; Desai, Arias, \nThompson, & Basile, 2002; Ministry of Women’s Affairs, 2012; Noll & Grych, 2011; Volker, \nRandjbar, Moritz, & Jelinek, 2013). An even stronger correlation has been found between young \nwomen who are sexually abused in adolescence and subsequent adult sexual abuse victimisation \n(Classen et al., 2005).\nGeneral prevalence studies\nLarge- and broad-scale studies tend to assume sexuality through omission of questions related \nto sexuality in their surveys, therefore it is unclear as to whether the prevalence and the factors \nassociated with recidivism differ between heterosexual and non-heterosexual groups. Despite \nlarge-scale studies being conducted on the issue of revictimisation, our understanding remains \nmurky, as definitions of sexual revictimisation vary among studies.\nOne such study by Chiu et al. (2013) examined the results from the Boston Area Community \nHealth (BACH) survey for the prevalence and overlap of childhood and adult physical, sexual \nand emotional abuse. The 2,301 men and 3,201 women in the survey who reported a history of \nchildhood abuse were more likely to also have experiences of adult sexual abuse. Participants \nin this study who had at least one type of child abuse incident were 5.8 times more likely to \nexperience an adult abuse incident (Chiu et al., 2013).\nThe researchers also reported that:\n the prevalence of adulthood sexual abuse was 15% among men who reported one \ntype of childhood abuse, 28% among men who reported two types of childhood \nabuse, and 57% among men who reported three types of childhood abuse. (Chiu \net al., 2013, p. 391)\nThe prevalence was slightly higher for women. The finding that exposure to multi-type \nmaltreatment1 is associated with subsequent adolescent or adult victimisation is iterated by other \nresearchers (Classen et al., 2005; Desai et al., 2002; Ministry of Women’s Affairs, 2012). The \n1 Multi-type maltreatment describes five overlapping types of child maltreatment—physical, sexual, psychological, neglect and witnessing \nfamily/domestic violence. (For more information please see Higgins & Price-Robertson, 2011; Higgins & McCabe, 2003.)\n4  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nstudy by Chui et al. (2013) does not delineate between heterosexual, gay, lesbian or bisexual \nparticipants, but does include a representative sample of diverse races/ethnicities as per the \ngreater Boston population.\nIn a large-scale, nationally representative telephone survey looking at child sexual abuse and \nsubsequent adult revictimisation, Desai et al. (2002) found women who had experienced child \nsexual abuse were three times more likely to be revictimised in adulthood. Men were also three \ntimes as likely to experience revictimisation if they had been sexually abused in childhood (Desai \net al., 2002). In other words, more people who had experienced child sexual abuse went on to \nbe revictimised in adulthood. One of the reasons given for this heightened risk of revictimisation \nis the emotional dysregulation and reduced risk perception of victimised individuals.\nOne clear message in the literature is the need to consider greater supports for children following \nan experience of child sexual abuse to temper the individual risk factors relevant to sexual \nrevictimisation (discussed later in this summary).\nGay, lesbian and bisexual communities\nA community of people often absent from discussions of sexual revictimisation continues to \nbe gay, lesbian and bisexual people. This can work to maintain the marginalised position that \nminority sexualities experience and can play a role in perpetuating the belief that sexual abuse \nand revictimisation does not occur as often or as destructively for gay, lesbian and bisexual \nindividuals (Fileborn, 2012).\nVery few studies look specifically at sexual revictimisation for gay men, lesbian women and \nbisexual men and women (Heidt et al., 2005; Hequembourg, Livingston, & Parks, 2013). One \nstudy by Heidt et al. (2005) began work in this field in order to at least present an initial \nprevalence rate of revictimisation for gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals on which other \nresearch could be built. They surveyed 307 individuals (139 male, 168 female: 118 gay men, 123 \nlesbians, 66 bisexual men and women). The authors defined sexual revictimisation as oral and \nvaginal contact or penetration in both childhood and adulthood (Heidt et al., 2005).\nThe researchers surveyed the participants about depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, life \nexperiences and sexual experiences. They found that 39% of the participants reported both a \nchildhood sexual abuse incident and a subsequent adult sexual victimisation incident. Although \nthis study is not representative, it offers an insight into revictimisation rates for gay, lesbian and \nbisexual populations, and highlights the need for greater research and for psychological services \nto be geared towards offering support and counselling for gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals \nwho have been sexually revictimised (Heidt et al., 2005).\nHequembourg et al. (2013) cite research indicating that rates of child sexual abuse may be \nhigher among bisexual and lesbian women—“15% to 76% among bisexual women and from \n18% to 60% among lesbian women” (p. 636)—than among heterosexual women (up to 29%). \nYet “despite a pernicious pattern of revictimization among heterosexual female child sexual \nabuse survivors, little is known about the patterns of revictimization among sexual minority \nwomen with histories of [child sexual abuse]” (p. 637). There is still a need for further research \nthat can more clearly elucidate the rates of sexual revictimisation as well as the differences and \nsimilarities in the experiences of diverse sexualities and sexual revictimisation.\nSexual revictimisation: Individual, interpersonal and contextual factors  |  5\nIndigenous communities\nThe history of forced resettlement on reserves, the placing of many thousands \nof children in institutions, and the loss of land and culture are evident in the \ndisadvantages still experienced by many Aboriginal people today. (Australian \nLaw Reform Commission, 2014, para. 29)\nIt is a significant task to undo the complex interplay of social disadvantages imposed by \nwhite settlement.. Although it is well documented that Indigenous communities experience \ndisadvantage and high levels of abuse and violence, no work has specifically investigated the \nrates of sexual revictimisation in a focused way (Keel, 2004).\nWhat is known is that child sexual abuse notifications in Indigenous communities are five times \ngreater than those for non-Indigenous communities (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, \n2012, Tables A1.34 and A31.37). Indigenous women are also up to four times more likely to \nbe the victims of sexual assault than non-Indigenous women (Australian Bureau of Statistics \n[ABS], 2012). Although there are no statistics outlining revictimisation rates for Indigenous men \nand women, the above statistics do give rise to the notion that sexual revictimisation would be \nprevalent in Indigenous communities.\nPeople with disabilities\nLike other chronically disadvantaged and invisible groups in society, some people with \ndisabilities deal with a complex constellation of social ills. Although there are excellent \norganisations that advocate on behalf of people with disabilities to gain greater visibility, sexual \nrevictimisation experiences of people with disabilities are often not represented in nationally \nrepresentative safety and crime statistics. This means that less is known about prevalence within \nthese communities. People with disabilities are, however, at greater risk of experiencing sexual \nassault and sexual revictimisation as they may be specifically targeted due to their perceived \nvulnerability (Murray & Powell, 2008).\nPeople with cognitive disabilities may be unable to disclose or even recognise abuse, which \nmeans prevalence statistics for revictimisation are not readily available. Unfortunately, nationally \nrepresentative surveys related to sexual victimisation do not ask for the disability status of \nparticipants (Murray & Powell, 2008). What is known is that that “approximately 20% of Australian \nwomen, and 6% of men” with a disability will experience sexual victimisation some time in their \nlives (ABS, 2006, as quoted in Murray & Powell, 2008). These statistics unfortunately do not help \nus in calculating rates of revictimisation.\nSummary of what is currently known about the prevalence of revictimisation\nIt is clear that the risk of sexual revictimisation is high for people who have experienced child \nsexual abuse (as opposed to multiple adult victimisation experiences, for example, for which \nstatistics and data are difficult to elucidate due to the paucity of research in this area). Vulnerable \ngroups are at particular risk, although a distinct lack of research and evidence obscures actual \nprevalence and complicates prevention efforts. There are a number of ways to understand \nsexual revictimisation; however, many of them focus on the obvious common denominator of \nthe victim, while ignoring the tactics that perpetrators use to target vulnerable people and the \nbroader cultural context that may contribute to sexual revictimisation (Clark & Quadara, 2010; \nCouncil of Australian Governments, 2011; Ministry of Women’s Affairs, 2012). The following \n6  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nsection outlines a theoretical framework that helps to shape a more holistic understanding of \nthe risks of sexual revictimisation.\nTheoretical framework for revictimisation\nA lack of adequate understanding about why and how sexual revictimisation occurs means the \nfocus has been placed on what is known: the victim/survivor. This is where the victim/survivor’s \nexperiences, life circumstances and decisions become the focal point for intervention. While the \nliterature presented in this paper will outline some identified risk factors for victim/survivors, it \nwill use Grauerholz’s (2000) socio-ecological model to explore how broader contexts relate to \nsexual revictimisation, and what avenues may be best explored, beyond the victim/survivor, in \nidentifying risk factors for sexual revictimisation.\nThe socio-ecological model is commonly used in violence and sexual assault prevention and \nwas used initially in public health prevention when it was adapted from Bronfenbrenner (1977). \nThe model indicates the interrelated aspects of social life and how they all play a part in forming \nbehaviours, such as those related to revictimisation (Figure 1). The socio-ecological model starts \nwith the societal sphere, which encompasses the community or organisational sphere, within \nwhich is the interpersonal or relationship sphere, and finally the individual sphere.\nSocietal Community Relationship Individual\nSource: Quadara & Wall, 2012, p. 4\nFigure 1: The socio-ecological model\nAlthough the victim/survivor is necessarily at the centre of the investigation into revictimisation \n—as it is only through sexual abuse and assault victim statistics that we know anything of \nrevictimisation—the phenomenon of sexual revictimisation can only really be understood by \nconsidering the four levels of the socio-ecological model: individual, relationship, community \nand societal The pertinent questions are how do these levels affect a victim/survivor’s behaviour \nand what supports do these levels provide for a perpetrator to sexually revictimise the victim/\nsurvivor?\nIndividual factors for the victim/survivor: Risks, impacts, correlates\nThe individual level of the socio-ecological model—the victim/survivor—is often where the \nfocus lies when seeking to identify risk factors. There is a range of literature regarding the \ndemographic features and characteristics of sexual abuse and assault victim/survivors (Classen \nSexual revictimisation: Individual, interpersonal and contextual factors  |  7\net al., 2005; Desai et al., 2002; Ministry of Women’s Affairs, 2012; Volker et al., 2013; Walsh, \nDiLillo, & Messman-Moore, 2012). It is important to have clarity on who is at risk and how \nto best respond to them, so this literature has been invaluable in the field of sexual assault \nresearch, policy and practice.\nIn a meta-analysis, Classen et al. (2005) reviewed 90 studies related to revictimisation. A strong \ncorrelation was found between young women who were sexually abused in adolescence and \nsubsequent adult sexual abuse victimisation (Classen et al., 2005). They also found at least 30 \nof the 90 studies indicated a strong correlation between child sexual abuse and subsequent \nadult sexual assault. The severity and type of abuse also correlated with revictimisation (Riser, \nHetzel-Riggin, Thomsen, & McCanne, 2006). Severity is defined variously in studies, however \nthe more intrusive the abuse, the greater the correlation with revictimisation (Classen et al., \n2005). Classen et al. concluded that it is very difficult to separate the literature on risks, impacts \nand correlates of revictimisation. It should be noted that correlation and association are not \ncausal factors and should be read as being related to revictimisation rather than directly causing \nrevictimisation. Classen et al., Riser et al., Noll and Grych (2011), and Walsh et al. (2012) found \nthat the following factors were related to revictimisation:\n\tchild and adolescent sexual abuse—can lead to risky sexual behaviour, substance misuse, \nshame and dissociation related to post traumatic stress disorder;\n\tlevel of severity of previous abuse;\n\ta recent incident of victimisation;\n\thaving a relationship with the perpetrator—intrafamilial sexual abuse was more closely \nassociated with revictimisation than extrafamilial sexual abuse;\n\tcumulative past abuse, i.e physical and sexual abuse;\n\tfamily factors such as dysfunction and high levels of conflict;\n\ta (mal)adaptive risk response to dangerous situations;\n\tpoor risk perception and emotional dysregulation (an impaired and poorly modulated \nemotional response);\n\tlevel of distress—particularly in relation to previous abuse. \nA specific area of inquiry into individual risk factors is how the impacts of sexual abuse and \nassault can mediate revictimisation. Below is a brief summary of the literature that explores these \nfactors.\nIndividual risk factors: Emotional dysregulation and risk perception\nParticular attention has been paid to victim/survivors’ emotional dysregulation and risk perception \nin creating vulnerability for sexual revictimisation. The literature on emotional dysregulation is \ninstructive in that it highlights the importance of therapeutic support following an incident of \nsexual abuse or assault. For many victim/survivors one of the effects of abuse can be an inability \nto connect with or accept their own feelings (to become angry with themselves if they feel sad, \nfor example). Noll and Grych (2011) stressed that an incomplete or “inadequate” response in the \nface of a dangerous situation that may lead to sexual revictimisation may stem from a biological \ndysregulation that can be traced back to child sexual abuse. In other words, a victim’s ability \nto engage with an imminent threat is compromised because of an impaired cognitive response \nmechanism.\n8  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nWalsh et al. (2012) explored the comparative risk perception between previously victimised and \nnon-victimised participants and found that those who had been previously victimised had a \nreduced ability to leave “risky” social situations. Similarly, Volker et al. (2013) looked at factors \nthat “put people at risk of repeated victimization” (p. 40). They found there was no significant \ndifference in risk perception between the three groups being researched (non-victimised, single-\nincident victimisation, and revictimised); however, the revictimised group were more likely \nto wait longer before leaving a perceived risky situation than the single-victimised and non-\nvictimised groups.\nThe intention of the above studies appears to be the identification of vulnerability within victim/\nsurvivors to revictimisation; however, it shifts almost imperceptibly towards victim-blaming and \noffers no immediate corrective to the risk or threat of revictimisation (Grauerholz, 2000; Wager, \n2009).\nTherefore, although these studies are of some interest to the field, it can be acknowledged \nthat for certain populations of victim/survivors of trauma they are of limited use. This creates a \ntension as it maintains a focus on the prevention of sexual revictimisation as the responsibility \nof the victim/survivor and creates a risk avoidance paradigm; this tension is explored below.\nThe tension in identifying individual risk factors for sexual revictimisation\nIdentifying individual risk factors is an important facet of sexual revictimisation research. \nHowever, for many populations, these studies shift prevention strategies into risk avoidance \nstrategies. The reason for this lies in the focus on the victim/survivor at the expense of looking \nmore broadly, including at the surrounding contextual factors related to sexual revictimisation.\nFor example, for a person with a disability who may be physically unable to leave a risky \nsituation, a focus on poor risk perception and individual risk factors more generally does not \nlessen the risk of revictimisation. This is particularly true if the person with a disability relies on \nothers for physical support, or is housed in an institution (Murray & Powell, 2008). “They are \nsilent, out of sight and out of mind. Worse still, these people remain at high risk of further sexual \nassault and abuse” (Goodfellow & Camilleri, 2003, p. 7).\nSimilarly, for Indigenous women who are geographically isolated in remote regions of Australia, \nthe ability to leave a risky situation is mediated by the knowledge that the perpetrators (both \nIndigenous and non-Indigenous) reside within the community and can access the victim any \ntime (Keel, 2004). Research by Edie Carter (as cited in Keel, 2004) reveals that Indigenous \nwomen have high rates of sexual assault, multiple perpetrator assaults and sexual assaults that \ncontinue over time. Coupled with this is an intergenerational element to the violence and abuse \nthat risks normalising sexual violence (Keel, 2004). These issues of vulnerability and risk are \nembedded within communities and social groups, making them difficult to walk away from.\nThe ability of victim/survivors to leave a risky situation may not be dependent on their perceived \nassessment of risk but rather on their understanding of the tactics used by perpetrators to isolate \nand disempower them using social norms (Clark & Quadara, 2010). This issue is discussed in \nthe following section.\nRelationship/interpersonal factors: Perpetrators\nAn important aspect of revictimisation is the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator, \nas well as the specific strategies and steps perpetrators use to take advantage of previously \nSexual revictimisation: Individual, interpersonal and contextual factors  |  9\nvictimised individuals. Forensic Interview Advisor with Victoria Police Patrick Tidmarsh states \n“It’s so important for people to understand the relationship and the context in which the abusive \nbehaviour takes place” (Tidmarsh, 2012, “What are some of the challenges”. para. 1).\nFor non-familial relationships, Clark and Quadara (2010) brought some clarity to understanding \nhow perpetrators choose vulnerable individuals. It is a highly social process and relies on the \nperpetrator taking advantage of trust, and exploiting the social scripts related to sexual seduction. \nClark and Quadara noted that perpetrators “made deliberate choices and enacted situationally \ntargeted strategies to secure sexual interaction with the victim/survivor” (p. 53). Their research \nincludes one story in which a victim of sexual violence who had spoken publically about the \ndetails of her assault was manipulated into a vulnerable situation by a perpetrator who “used \nthe same method of overpowering me as I’d described in my speech” (Dana, as quoted in Clark \n& Quadara, 2010, p. 23).\nGay, lesbian and bisexual individuals and communities have historically had a difficult \nrelationship with social acceptance within a majority heterosexual society. This tension and lack \nof acceptance can manifest at the individual level as hate crimes. “Individuals (and communities \nof people) who challenge the dominant norms around sex, gender, and sexuality can face \nsignificant levels of violence and abuse of both a physical and sexual nature” (Fileborn, 2012, \np. 3). The fear of not being socially accepted may keep gay, lesbian, trans, bisexual, intersex \nand queer (GLTBIQ) individuals in unsafe relationships where intimate partner sexual violence \nis a feature. Fileborn’s review of the literature on sexual violence against those in the GLBTIQ \ncommunity suggests that sexual assaults can be homophobic in nature.\nBeyond the interaction between the perpetrator and the victim/survivor, this social sphere also \nincludes consideration of a support system that the victim/survivor may draw from following \ntheir revictimisation. Victim/survivors of sexual violence demonstrate lower levels of trauma and \nharm following an assault if they are able to access strong support networks such as family and \nfriends to help them process the trauma (Boyd, 2011).\nThese examples, which consider vulnerable populations, illustrate the importance of taking a \nwider view when considering where risk of sexual revictimisation is situated. Questions related \nto the types of initiatives to be undertaken for the prevention of sexual revictimisation can \ncast a wider net to include perpetrators that target those with a history of sexual violence \nand vulnerability (Noll, 2005). Of course, perpetrators and their victims live within a broader \ncommunity context that influences their interactions. This social sphere is explored in the \nfollowing section.\nCommunity/organisational factors: Microsystems\nThe next level in the socio-ecological model is the microsystem, or the community and \norganisational sphere of life. To understand how community and organisational factors may \ncontribute to sexual revictimisation, Grauerholz (2000) reminds us to be concerned with “how \nsocial power is derived and how one’s (lack of) social power contributes to vulnerability” (pp. \n12–13). Apart from factors such as socio-economic position, gender, disability, ethnicity, class \nand sexuality having an influence on social power, so too does a history of victimisation. This \ncan translate into how a victim/survivor experiences his/her relationships with the broader \ncommunity and organisations with which they engage (Grauerholz, 2000).\n10  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nOrganisational policies and procedures and the communities within which they are embedded can \nshape how support is provided to victim/survivors of sexual violence and sexual revictimisation \n(Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, 2010).\nCommunity attitudes\nThe attitudes and beliefs of people within communities can also be instrumental in supporting \nor removing support for the resources that perpetrators use to target vulnerable people. These \nattitudes and beliefs can include perceptions related to alcohol and/or drug use, how often \nwomen falsify claims of violence by a partner, how likely people are to intervene in domestic \nviolence incidences and belief in gender equity (Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, 2010). \nThe National Survey on Community Attitudes to Violence Against Women (2010) found that 16% \nof women and 16% of men believed that “if a woman is raped while she is drunk or affected by \ndrugs she is at least partly responsible” for her rape (Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, \n2010, p. 41). This attitude indicates a victim-blaming stance towards rape victim/survivors \nthat can also be considered a supportive attitude towards sexual assault perpetration—giving \njustification to sexual violence due to a victim’s intoxication. Overall,  community attitudes \ntoward sexual violence are improving, but the above statistics demonstrate that negative views \nabout sexual abuse survivors are still present in sections of our population.\nOrganisational policies: The police\nThis section briefly considers how an organisation, such as the police force, may affect sexual \nrevictimisation. Indeed other organisations may also effect revictimisation and the police force is \nmerely being used as one example here. There is research which also looks at how the criminal \njustice system more broadly may include bias in decision-making processes that ultimately \ndisadvantages sexual assault victims, including prosecutorial decision-making (see Kelly, 2010; \nLievore, 2004). There exists a large body of literature on sexual assault that considers barriers \nto disclosure of sexual violence for victim/survivors (see Allimant & Ostapiej-Piatkowski, 2011; \nFoster, Boyd, & O’Leary, 2012; Quadara, 2008). Due to longstanding cultural myths surrounding \nsexual assault, many victim/survivors do not report their assault to police (Fileborn, 2012; Foster \net al., 2012; Jordan, 2004). Victim/survivors may fear being disbelieved by the police, having \ntheir private lives exposed, being blamed for the assault and might not even feel the assault \nwarrants police time. As the police are an important avenue of justice for victims of crime as well \nas an important social institution, there is some urgency in ensuring police responses to victim/\nsurvivors of sexual revictimisation reflects victim/survivors’ needs.\nThere is research to suggest that police have increased both their understanding and their \nsupport of rape victim/survivors in recent years; however, as Jordan (2004) demonstrates in her \nresearch, this has not always been the case.\nJordan (2004) conducted research into police decision-making in relation to rape victim/survivors. \nThe research demonstrates that a majority of women who reported a sexual revictimisation were \nclassified as “possibly true/possibly false” or “police said false”. Jordan contended that these \nclassifications were based on biased decision making rather than thorough police investigations. \nThis means that police were making various decisions about the integrity of the victim/survivor \nand how believable their report was based on their own views of how a victim/survivor \nof assault should act. Additionally, police may consider a report as “possibly true/possibly \nfalse” if there is insufficient evidence (Jordan, 2004). Insufficient evidence has always been an \nunfortunate hallmark of sexual assault cases. Considering the nature of the assault (usually only \nSexual revictimisation: Individual, interpersonal and contextual factors  |  11\nthe perpetrator and the victim are present), it does not mean an assault did not take place or is \nbeing falsely reported (Wall & Tarczon, 2013).\nJordan’s study also demonstrates why data on sexual revictimisation are so patchy. If police \nin the study considered sexual revictimisation as a dubious and unlikely possibility, then the \nconcept of sexual revictimisation is not well understood nor given adequate legitimacy. This \naffects the collection of data, which, in turn, can have an effect on research efforts.\nA study on police investigations and the outcomes of rapes reported to Victoria Police found \nthat police brought forward charges on only 15% of the cases reported to them in a three-year \nperiod (Heenan & Murray, 2006, as cited in Morrison, 2008). In the same three-year period, 26% \nof the cases included a victim/survivor who had mental health issues. These cases were twice \nas likely to be labelled as false allegations by police. This echoes Jordan’s work and indicates \na significant bias against people with mental health issues or cognitive disabilities who report \nsexual revictimisation.\nThese examples are indicative of community conditions that foster a lack of support for \npeople who are sexually revictimised. Findings such as these illustrate Grauerholz’s theory that \ncontextual factors are important factors in sexual revictimisation and a site for the identification \nof risk factors beyond the individual. It is also at this level of the socio-ecological model that \neducation campaigns and community-based programs can support respectful relationships and \ngender equality principles, which are considered important in reducing violence against women \nmore broadly (Council of Australian Governments, 2011). Taking an even wider view, societal \nfactors can also play a part in sexual revictimisation, and how this might occur is explored in \nthe section below.\nSocietal factors contributing to sexual revictimisation: The broader \nview\nThe broadest sphere of the socio-ecological model is the social sphere encompassing social \nand cultural processes, beliefs, systems and structures. “To fully understand the process of \nrevictimisation or any gender/family violence, one needs to take into account the larger cultural \ncontext in which the individual, her relationships, and the community are embedded” (Grauerholz, \n2000, p. 14). The National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children identifies \nbroader cultural beliefs and attitudes related to sexual violence that require change in order to \nreduce violence against women (Council of Australian Governments, 2011). The cultural belief that \nvictim/survivors are somehow responsible for their abuse is a relevant factor in victim/survivors \nnot disclosing incidents of sexual abuse due to, for instance feelings of shame, and this, in turn, \nincreases the risk of sexual revictimisation (Grauerholz, 2000; Wall, 2012).\nFor more vulnerable communities, the broader social context can have an even greater immediate \neffect. Due to a history of colonisation, displacement and disenfranchisement, Indigenous \npeople have been reluctant to report instances of sexual victimisation and sexual revictimisation \nto authorities, preferring to disclose to family and community members (Australian Institute of \nCriminology, 2011). This has resulted in very little data being generated regarding prevalence, \nrevictimisation and help seeking mechanisms utilised in Indigenous communities. This is \nparticularly true of remote communities that experience wide-ranging disadvantage and require \nquite complex system responses (Bath, 2013). Although rates of sexual victimisation are high, \nmany Indigenous communities would rather see offenders offered an avenue to heal, than to be \nimprisoned. How non-Indigenous Australian society addresses sexual revictimisation may not fit \n12  |  Australian Institute of Family Studies\nfor Indigenous communities (Keel, 2004). It is therefore important to acknowledge and address \nhow wider Australian society affects rates of sexual revictimisation in Indigenous communities \nand how it can support Indigenous communities to reduce rates of sexual revictimisation.\nOther social factors related to sexual revictimisation for vulnerable or minority populations \ninclude the beliefs that:\n\tsexual violence doesn’t occur in same-sex relationships;\n\tsexual violence is rare;\n\twomen often falsely report rape;\n\tsexual revictimisation is just a part of Indigenous culture;\n\tmen can’t be raped; and\n\twomen are complicit in their sexual revictimisation (Duncanson, 2013; Fileborn, 2012; \nVictorian Health Promotion Foundation, 2010; Wall & Tarczon, 2013).\nWhen considering the factors that underlie sexual revictimisation, a broader view looking \noutward from the individual, encompassing their relationships, their communities and the \nbroader cultural landscape may be a more effective and holistic approach to understanding \nsexual revictimisation (Grauerholz, 2000). It is also at this level of the socio-ecological model \nthat prevention strategies for revictimisation can be given a broader focus in a similar way to \nprevention strategies for violence against women (see Council of Australian Governments, 2011; \nVictorian Health Promotion Foundation, 2007).\nConclusion\nThe available literature on sexual revictimisation reveals a focus on how individual victim/\nsurvivors of child sexual abuse and/or adolescent sexual abuse “are at considerable risk for \nsubsequent victimisation whereas others successfully avoid it” (Noll, 2005, p. 458). Yet ways to \n“avoid” sexual revictimisation seem to target only the victim/survivor. Of course, the individual \nmust do all they can to decrease the risk of further victimisation, and the literature concerning \nsexual revictimisation reveals that risk perception and emotional dysregulation exhibited by \nvictim/survivors of sexual violence are a focus for intervention. This indicates a need to provide \ntherapeutic services and interventions to all victim/survivors of sexual violence in an effort to \ntreat trauma and traumatic symptoms so they are not a mediating factor in further victimisation.\nFor minority groups who are more vulnerable to sexual revictimisation due to their disability, \nsexuality or because they are Indigenous, greater advocacy, research and supports are required in \norder that these groups do not remain under-researched, and that evidence-based interventions \ncan reduce the rates of sexual revictimisation among these groups. However, it cannot be \nignored that much of the literature on the risks for sexual revictimisation, in focusing on the \nindividual risk factors, tend to ignore the broader social context.\nUsing the work of Grauerholz (2000), this research summary presents a more holistic view of \nthe supports for sexual revictimisation through use of the socio-ecological model. The socio-\necological model for sexual revictimisation demonstrates sites of risk beyond the individual, \nsuch as perpetrators who target vulnerable people, community attitudes that blame rape victims, \nand social systems that have disenfranchised minority groups from their own culture.\nKnowing the contextual factors related to sexual revictimisation, we can focus on prevention \nstrategies that address them, such as respectful relationship education, gender equality principles \nand a focus on important sites of social norm reproduction, such as sporting sites and the media, \nSexual revictimisation: Individual, interpersonal and contextual factors  |  13\nto convey messages of respect and equality (Council of Australian Governments, 2011; Victorian \nHealth Promotion Foundation, 2007). These strategies currently make up primary prevention \nefforts for sexual and physical violence against women more generally. Situating risk in the \nsocio-ecological model allows for a more holistic view of risk. It points us in the right direction \nfor increasing our understanding of the prevalence of sexual revictimisation and  beginning the \nwork of strategising towards possible prevention models for sexual revictimisation.\nReferences\nAllimant, A., & Ostapiej-Piatkowski, B.

    "abstract": "People who have been sexually abused as children are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. This paper explores the complex array of variables related to sexual revictimisation.\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a complex array of variables related to sexual revictimisation. Although prevalence is difficult to ascertain, several studies relate that people who have been sexually abused as children are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. Much of the literature on sexual revictimisation focuses on the individual risk factors for the victim/survivor - their risk perception and emotional dysregulation resulting from initial sexual victimisation - and how these create vulnerability for sexual revictimisation. Broader contextual factors beyond the victim/survivor, however, are often ignored. These contextual factors are explored here with a particular emphasis on minority groups, such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people. This focus demonstrates that individual risk factors often do not account for how perpetrators may target vulnerable people who have previously been victimised, how community and organisational attitudes and norms may support sexual revictimisation, and how broader social norms create vulnerability for certain groups. A focus on these broader contextual factors helps to inform prevention strategies.\n\nKey messages\n\n\n\tPeople who are sexually abused in childhood are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood.\n\tIndividual risk factors include a history of child sexual abuse, poor risk perception, emotional dysregulation, cumulative past abuse, family conflict and distress.\n\tBroader contextual factors, such as perpetrator tactics, community and organisational attitudes, and social norms, are also risk factors for sexual revictimisation.\n\tThose vulnerable to sexual revictimisation, including minority groups such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people may require greater support and advocacy in order to alleviate trauma and trauma symptoms, and increase their resilience.\n\tSimilar strategies used in the sexual violence primary prevention space may be used to prevent sexual revictimisation. This includes respectful relationships education, gender equity principles and a focus on important sites of social norm reproduction, such as sporting sites and the media, to convey messages of respect and equality",
