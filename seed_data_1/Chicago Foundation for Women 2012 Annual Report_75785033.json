To support our philanthropy, the Foundation promotes increased investment in women and girls, raises awareness about their issues and potential, and develops them as leaders and philanthropists.OUR VISIONChicago Foundation for Women envisions a community and world in which all women and girls have the opportunity to achieve their full potential and live in safe, just, and healthy communities.about ⅓ of all crimes reported are domesticviolence related.nearly 40%  of singlemothers earnless than$22,314per year.yet, only 7.3%of all grantsare directed toward women and girls.as many as 25,000 women andgirls areinvolved inthe sex trade.ChiCago FoundaTion For Women  |  7we’re  working  right now  to change  all that.here’s how:WE HAVE A LOT TO DO. Chicago women and girls face difficult and inter-related issues of economic security, access to education, domestic violence, immigration, and access to health care. every day, our grantees tackle these complicated, controversial, sometimes life threatening problems with shoestring budgets so women and girls can meet their full potential. given the escalating needs in our community, Chicago Foundation for Women takes a comprehensive, systemic approach in the support we provide, looking at multiple issues affecting Chicago area women and girls through their whole lives.nearly 27 years ago, our founders marjorie Craig Benton, Sunny Fischer, iris Krieg, and Lucia Woods Lindley, understood it was unjust that only 3% of funds went to support women and girls. They created Chicago Foundation for Women (CFW) to connect need, money and solutions. Since 1985, CFW has given over $20 million through nearly 3,000 grants to organizations that serve the needs of women and girls by addressing our three focus areas: expanding economic security, ensuring freedom from violence, and enhancing access to health services and information.our work consists not just of grantmaking, but also providing other necessary support for building strong, sustainable grantee or-ganizations that build healthy communities. We provide training, technical assistance, and consultation to our grantees and promote advocacy efforts.This year, we have exciting news for CFW. We created a strategic alliance with the eleanor Foundation, a public grant making organiza-tion that focused on helping female-heads of household achieve economic self-sufficiency. CFW is now in a unique place to have greater impact on the lives and security of more Chi-cago women and their families. as the report will detail, this is just one of many significant achievements of CFW from the past year. Chicago Foundation for Women is dedicated to meeting all challenges that women and girls face with innovative solutions, and the money to fund them. and thanks to your help and commitment to our mission, we will help women and girls thrive. Let’s continue to talk about the best ways to develop strong, healthy and secure communities. Let’s build our support for Chicago women and girls.LET’S GET TO WORk.Andrea S. kramer k. SujataDEAR FRIENDS,2 0 1 1  A N N U A L  R E P O R T :  W o r k i n g  a t  t h e  i n t e r s e c t i o n s 1November 2011Dear Friends,Since 1985 Chicago Foundation for Women has improved the lives of millions of women and girls by supporting programs that serve their needs, advocating policies that serve their interests, and engaging women as philanthropists, leaders and decision makers. To date, we have given nearly $19 million through almost 3,000 grants, and we must continue to do this work—and much more—given today’s harsh economic realities. Joblessness and financial insecurity affect women and girls profoundly, and CFW won’t shy away from the complexity of women’s lives. We support programs that tackle many issues simultaneously. We work at the intersections of women’s lives.We acknowledge demographics like age, race and income but we also focus on women’s lived experiences: the barriers presented by domestic violence, homelessness and lack of health care, as well as the lessons gained through motherhood, immigration and education.To ensure girls’ future economic security, for example, we must examine the intersection of education and gender-based violence. When schools take dating violence, sexual assault and bullying seriously, they create safer classrooms where students can succeed. Women at the intersection of motherhood and incarceration deserve community-based sentences instead of jail time for minor offenses. This way, we can k ep families whole and stop the generational cycle of poverty. Communities of color live at the intersection of racial inequality and reproductive j stice, bearing the br nt f laws and policies restricting reproductive freedoms. To turn the tide we must invest in grassroots advocacy led by women of color, whose policy work is transforming the political landscape locally and nationally. Chic g  Foundation for Women will stand strong t these inter ections—and many, many more—thanks to the generosity and dedication of thousands of donors who share our vision: a world in which all women and girls have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.

SujataPresident/CEOChiCago FoundaTion For Women  |  9annual report 2012WITH SO MANy FAMILIES LIVING bELOW THE POVERTy LINE, Chicago Foundation for Women aims to expand opportunities for mothers and their children. That’s why we support Chicago Women in Trades (CWiT). CWiT is committed to eliminat- ing the barriers that keep women from entering and succeeding in jobs tradi- tionally held by men. CWiT offers pre-apprenticeship programs that prepare and connect women to high wage occupations, such as plumbing and welding. CFW believes that once a woman has a job where she is secure, she can provide better opportunities for her family. CFW also seeks to expand horizons for girls through organizations like alternatives, inc. and the girl World program. Participants of the girl World program are “hired” after an extensive application and interview process and then trained on aca- demic success, career-planning, philanthropy, and life skills. The end result: a cohort of leaders who make healthy life decisions. Chicago Foundation for Women’s grantees are helping women and girls attain secure and self- sufficient lives--and inspiring them to reimagine their futures.CHICAGO FOUNDATION FOR WOMEN bELIEVES ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO AFFORDAbLE AND COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE. This includes one of Chicago’s most at-risk populations: women and girls working in the sex trade. in Chicago, an estimated 16,000 - 25,000 women and girls are currently involved in the sex trade, over half of them entering before the age of 18. many social service providers do not understand the unique and complex health needs of these young women. That is why CFW is sure to fund innovative organizations that provide access to health care and health information for aLL women and girls. The Young Women’s empowerment Project (YWeP) is an example. YWeP offers a respectful, judgment -free space where current and former sex workers sup-port each other. The participants connect and educate one another about their reproductive rights and health care needs. These young women can also turn to another CFW grantee to receive the direct care they need. Chicago Women’s health Center (CWhC) is the longest operating women’s health collective in the u.S. for women and transgender individuals. Their holistic programs provide quality health care, regardless of an individual’s ability to pay. Through CFW’s support of progressive organizations like YWeP and CWhC, CFW is addressing the health care needs of all women.WHEN IMMIGRANT WOMEN COME TO CHICAGO, THEy ARE OFTEN FACED WITH SEEMINGLy INSURMOUNTAbLE ObSTACLES: language barriers, cultural taboos and fears of deportation. Chicago Foundation for Women is committed to addressing the needs of this population and ensuring that all women and girls--regardless of race, ethnicity or socioeconomic status--are free from violence. That is why CFW funds groundbreaking organizations like apna ghar, which addresses domestic violence for low-income women and children from South asia and other immigrant communities. For over 20 years, CFW’s support has provided a safe haven for more than 5,400 domestic violence survivors. Still, many more women refuse to seek immediate care and remain silent for fear of losing their children, their home, or their communities. The national immigrant Justice Center (niJC), another CFW grantee, is a voice for these women. The niJC has a proven track record of seeking justice for immigrant women and advancing policy changes that support their fundamental protection. From their advocacy on the inhumane use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention systems, to their work on the Violence against Women act (VaWa), niJC is changing the lives of women, one policy at a time.ECONOMIC SECURITy GRANTEESaccess Living of metropolitan Chicagoaffinity Community Servicesalternatives, inc.Chicago Women in TradesCommunity organizing and Family issuesdeborah’s Placeellen Stone Belic institute for the Study of Women and gender in the arts and mediagirlForwardgirls 4 Scienceillinois action for ChildrenJane addams resource CorporationJane addams Senior CaucusLatino union of ChicagoLiterature for all of usProject explorationrivendell Theatre ensembleSargent Shriver national Center on Poverty LawThe night ministryWomen & Children First BookstoreWomen employed instituteWoodstock instituteYouth Job Center of evanstonYWCa of evanston/north ShoreFREEDOM FROM VIOLENCE GRANTEESapna ghararab american Family ServicesCentro romeroChicago alliance against Sexual exploitationdelta Sigma Theta Sorority, inc., Chicagoalumnae Chapter human rights Watchillinois Safe Schools alliance Korean american Community ServicesKorean american Women in needLatinos ProgresandoHEALTH ACCESS GRANTEESaffinity Community Servicesamigas Latinas associationChicago abortion FundChicago Legal advocacy for incarcerated mothersChicago Women’s health Center, inc.CommunityhealthCrossroads Funddemoiselle 2 Femme nfpgirls in the gamehearT Women & girls Projectheartwood Foundationillinois Caucus for adolescent healthillinois maternal & Child health Coalitionmetropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Forcemidwest access Projectnational asian Pacific american Women’s Forum-Chicago ChapterPlanned Parenthood of illinoisroger Baldwin Foundation of the aCLu, inc.Teen Parent ConnectionYoung Women’s empowerment ProjectFREEDOM FROM VIOLENCE GRANTEES (CONT.)mujeres Latinas en acciónnational immigrant Justice CenterPaVe: Promoting awareness Victim empowermentPritzker military Libraryrainbow houserape Victim advocatesSarah’s innuCanYouth outlookYWCa of metropolitan ChicagoexpandingconnectingempoweringTHE WORk WE’RE DOINGThis past year,CFW awarded $750,446 ingrants to 62 organizations.IT’S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT CHICAGO FOUNDATION FOR WOMENSince 1985, CFW has provided seed funding to 110 emerging organizations and 73 are stillthriving today.CFWprovided 100 organizations capacity building opportunitiesin 2012ChiCago FoundaTion For Women  |  15annual report 2012THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORy, CFW HAS UNDERSTOOD THAT DIRECT SERVICES TO WOMEN AND GIRLS MUST bE ACCOMPANIED by ADVOCACy. advocacy fosters systemic change. That’s why in 2012, approximately 50% of CFW grant dollars were dedicated to supporting policy and social change efforts. With CFW’s funding, grantee Chicago Legal advocacy for incarcerated mothers (CLaim) successfully back- ed a bill to protect pregnant women against shackling while in custody. They were also part of the coalition that resulted in a $4.1 million settlement for pregnant prisoners. This is just one example. another victory was won by Chicago alliance against Sexual exploitation (CaaSe). CaaSe’s activism in the end demand illinois campaign led to the passing of three legislative laws that offer protections for survivors of the sex trade. CaaSe’s successes come after only two years of advocacy and we are pleased to be one of their first funders. We are proud to be one of a few institutional funders that support advocacy work happening here in Chicago.CHICAGO FOUNDATION FOR WOMEN IS THE FIRST WOMEN’S FUND IN THE UNITED STATES TO DEVELOP AFFINITy GROUPS OF DIVERSE WOMEN TO LEAD COMMUNITy OUTREACH EFFORTS, SETTING A NATIONAL PRECEDENT. Since then, the african american, asian american, Latina, Lesbian and Young Women’s Leadership Councils have award-ed 78 grants totaling $237,026. The Councils are comprised of local women leaders who serve as ambassadors to their communities. The Leadership Coun-cils have a collective mission to promote and expand women’s philanthropy and leadership across diverse communities. The councils accomplish the mis-sion by: supporting programs through dedicated grantmaking, raising funds through events, personal solicitations and membership fees, promoting and cultivating leadership among underrepresented women and engaging their communities through events and collaborative partnerships.CHICAGO FOUNDATION FOR WOMEN IS MORE THAN A FUNDER. one third of CFW’s grantees are grassroots organizations with a budget size of less than $500,000. These organizations are rarely able to access necessary and valuable profes-sional development and capacity building opportunities. CFW is filling that gap by providing capacity-building and technical assistance programs to hundreds of Chicago organizations. For example, CFW’s Core Concepts is a series of skill-building workshops in areas like budgeting, communications, fundraising, and succession planning. Chicago Foundation for Women is also committed to building the individual professional development of grantee staff through free trainings, educational opportunities and networking events.  in February 2012, Chicago Foundation for Women launched the advocacy academy with 20 participants. The pro- gram’s mission is to train key staff members of nonprofit organizations that serve women and girls. The advocacy academy helps advance core advocacy skills for participants while strengthening the capacity of individual organizations. Through this innovative program, CFW is creating new and stronger coalitions among grantees and building a stronger women’s movement in Chicago.advocatinginvestingeducatingTHE WORk WE’RE DOINGLIST OF LEADERSHIP COUNCIL 2012 GRANTEESLavender Fund of the LesbianLeadership Councilaffinity Community ServicesChicago Women’s health Centerillinois Safe Schools allianceWomen & Children First BookstoreuCanMaria Mangual Fund of the LatinaLeadership Councilrainbow houseSilk Fund of the Asian AmericanLeadership Councilarab american Family ServicesKorean american Women in neednational asian Pacific american Women’s Forum- Chicago ChapterSojourner Fund of the African AmericanLeadership Councildemoiselle 2 Femme nfp girls 4 Scienceyoung Women’s Leadership Fund of the young Women’s Leadership Councilalternatives, inc.girlForward2012 CAPACITy bUILDING TRAININGSadvocacy for Systems ChangeBoards That Work: Lessons from the FieldBudgeting in Times of economic uncertainty Fiduciary responsibilities of nonprofitBoard membershow to be an effective Spokesperson forYour organization Board member Boot Camp Board member “reboot” - advanced Course2012 ADVOCACy ACADEMy SESSIONSThe rules of the road: advocacy Basics for 501(c) (3) organizationsit isn’t Just Spin: Values Based messagingWriting for impact: Press releases, op-eds, and Letters to the editorit really isn’t all about You: Coalition BuildingSausage making: understanding State and City Budget ProcessesTweetBookingin: making Social mediaWork for YouChiCago FoundaTion For Women  |  17Chicago’s women and girls needyou right now.INDIVIDUAL DONORS$100,000+Lucia Woods Lindley $20,000 - $99,999anonymousFay Clayton and Lowell Sachnoffginny holtnancy Juda and Jens Braschmarcena W. and norris Lovegail and harry Ludewiganita and Prabhakant SinhaFrances K.
