Scholars debate the effectiveness of international treaties in addressing this \nproblem. The Convention on Elimination and Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) of \n1979 requires ratifying countries to uplift equality and denounce discrimination of women \nnationally, in public and private spheres. Examining Bosnia and Herzegovina as a case study \nshows the effectiveness CEDAW has in creating political and social change. In addition, the \nBosnian War illustrates the threat sexualized violence has on individual autonomy. Findings \nshow that CEDAW and grassroots feminist activism are successful together in advocating for \nsocial and political change. These results support the power of international treaties when \ncombined with grassroots support for the cause. Over time, social change is possible as a \nconsequence of international jurisprudence, which will help end sexualized violence globally, \none individual at a time.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \nAcknowledgements \n \nI wish to express my sincere thanks to Professor Katja Favretto.

Thirty-five percent of women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual \nviolence by a partner or non-partner. This estimate is based on available data and is not a new \nphenomenon. Sexualized violence has a central role in society dating back to ancient and \nbiblical records, which continues today. Many references in the Old Testament justify rape as \nan act inevitable to conflict (Vikman 23). Historically, victories of war symbolically end \nthrough mass rapes in the conquered city. Viking culture establishes the end of the war \nthrough the rape and pillaging of the conquered land (Coupland). Written novels, art, music, \nand other surviving cultural depictions have emulated women as prizes of conquest and the \nviolence against women as inevitable to society. History demonstrates sexualized violence as \na foundational role in the social and cultural norms of society. In the twentieth century, \nsociety begins to acknowledge women through law as humans, prompting a turning point \nfrom their status as property. However, this pivot does not lead to a change in the occurrence \nof discrimination and violence against women. Sexualized violence is a human rights \nviolation and is a significant problem in the world affecting many individuals. This violence \ntakes many forms and affects all persons and identities under both peaceful and wartime \nconditions. This global problem of sexualized violence persists and requires considerable \nattention. \nA horrific genocide and ethnic cleansing campaign occurred in the early 1990’s in \nsouthern Europe known as the Bosnian Genocide. As the Former Yugoslavia failed and broke \nup into separate nations, the Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević perpetrated genocide on \nethnic, religious, and gender division. Milošević ordered an ethnic cleansing campaign to \ndilute the physical existence of Muslim Bosnians. He ordered mass rapes, instituted rape \ncamps, and mandated torture from his Serbian army to target Muslim Bosnian women to \nimpregnate or kill. Muslim Bosnians, primarily women, were targeted because of their ethnic \n5 \nidentity. Soldiers raped and tortured non-Serbian women and families: there are accounts of \nfamily members being forced to rape one another as well as other horrific forms of sadistic \ntorture (Stiglmayer). This horrific genocide officially lasted three years, leaving a significant \nportion of the population either dead or displaced. In addition, the physical, emotional, and \nspiritual traumas endured from this genocide are lifelong consequences. This genocide is not \nisolated in its horrors, representing the profound scope of sexualized violence.  \nSexualized violence continues to occur under peaceful conditions, outside of conflict \nand war. Sexual harassment, marital rape, forced prostitution, sexual slavery, and more, \ncontinue to persist globally outside of conflict. The international community has denounced \nsexualized violence and violations against individuals through declarations of human rights. \nAdditional conventions, treaties, and legislation followed, to protect and condemn other \nhuman rights abuses. However, given the existing prevalence of global sexualized violence, \nwhat is an effective solution to address and end this injustice? Because international laws \ncondemning these actions exist, what should be implemented to support these declarations? \nThe continuation of this problem demonstrates how norms and standards of behavior fueling \nthis problem have not evolved enough. Can international laws have an impact on pressuring \nnational reforms and create necessary social change? And finally, what other contributing \nfactors can play in a successful change to address and end global sexualized violence? \nExamining the scholarly breadth of this topic will illuminate both the strengths and \nshortcomings in the field to solve this problem.  \nVisible and influential, international treaties can influence change over time and \nsuccessfully address sexualized violence globally. Although the success of international \ntreaties is contested, their existence shows small increments of change, which will have more \nsignificance over time.  Accounting for feminism and intersectionality, feminist framed \nlegislation provides the necessary support for grassroots organization, community activism, \n6 \nand individuals seeking national reform. This global standard of behavior is wide-reaching \nand powerful, despite its lack of enforcement. International treaties are a first step in \naddressing a global concern and sparking statewide changes. International condemnation of \nsexualized violence influences national reform and supports all individuals from this \ninjustice. \nBackground Research \nThis paper defines effectiveness as the success of incremental change. There are many \nways to approach global issues, and in addressing sexualized violence, effective solutions \ncreate change, no matter how significant. Small increments are impactful in the lives of \nindividuals, and the autonomy of individual lives is the primary concern for this paper.  \nAddressing sexualized violence as a global problem is considerable and crosses many \ndisciplines. This paper deliberately defines sexualized violence as a violation to individual \nautonomy perpetrated through physical, emotional, and or spiritual violence. There are many \ndefinitions available; however, the decision to use this framework is calculated to account for \nscope and the many forms of sexualized violence. Although sexualized violence \npredominantly affects women and non-binary gender identifications, men also experience this \nviolation. Violence against women is the predominant focus in this work even though no one \nperson, nationality, gender, or intersectional being is exempt from experiencing sexualized \nviolence. Leading feminist scholar Catherine MacKinnon defines violence against women as \n“aggression against and exploitation of women because we are women, systemically and \nsystematically” (Are Women Human 29). Violence against women is significant because the \naggression is purposefully perpetrated against a gendered body. The word systematic \nreferences socially patterned sexual violence, such as sexual harassment, rape, sexual \nexploitation of children, and more. Sexualized violence is also systematic in ways of \n“intentionally organized” acts, like prostitution, pornography, and torture (MacKinnon, Are \n7 \nWomen Human 29). These violations take physical, emotional, and spiritual forms in private \nand public spheres. Violence does not exist solely through brute force that is easily visual and \nidentifiable. In addition to physical violations, sexualized violence is oppressive through \nemotional, mental, social, and spiritual trauma, violating human rights. Sexualized violence is \na human rights violation that needs to end.  \nThe surface line of thought surrounding sexualized violence begins with excusable \nmyths. Social rape myths excuse this unjust behavior as a consequence of sexual drive. These \nideas manifest in understanding rape as natural occurrences stemming from biology (Seifert \n35). Rape myths justify the idea that gendered aggression is inevitable and unavoidable in \nany society (Weiss). In wartime, rape is seen as “regrettable side effects of the war” (Seifert \n36). This understanding of rape, as inevitable to conflict and society, enforces the norms that \nthe violation of personal autonomy does and will continue to occur (Niarchos). These myths \nproduce norms that constrain the definition of rape socially and legally, making it more \ndifficult to reform behavior.  \nLegislation is an approach to sexualized violence to punish those who execute these \ncrimes and provide justice for victims. This liberal approach shifts the focus from gender to \nto violations to the citizen. Laws address this problem by mitigating the effects of the \nviolation, not targeting the causes until significant time passes. However, domestic and \ninternational laws often fail to convict many cases of rapes due to the norms and myths \nsurrounding the image of sexualized violence (Connell 510). Many experiences of rape when \nreported, “are not treated as criminal by the criminal justice system” (Estrich 8). Laws often \nfail to account for the scope of sexualized violence and fails to recognize a significant amount \nof crimes. Feminist and intersectional theorists work to explain this failure in the law by \nexposing the lack of feminism in the laws while providing a framework for how to best \napproach the legislation.  \n8 \nAlthough many nations recognize actions of sexualized violence as unjust and illegal, \nlaws often fail because the legislation lacks a feminist perspective. Useful jurisprudence \naccounts for the intersecting identities that contribute to individual experience in society. The \nlegal definition of rape in The United States is heteronormativity formulated around \npenetration and the male perspective, rather than the perspective of one who experiences this \nviolation. Penetration is a defining feature of rape and is, “a very male point of view on what \nit means to be sexually violated… rape is defined by what men think violates women” \n(MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified 87). The violator should not define the experience of \nviolation. Instead, criminalized acts should be defined by those who experience injustice. \nThis formation of the law acts as an additional form of violence and discrimination for \nvictims. There are many reasons for low conviction rates, including the failure of legislation \nto represent the experience of violation wholly. To convict a case of rape, the one violated \nmust prove their experience was not consensual sex. However, many factors blur this \ndistinction; Mackinnon suggests, “maybe they were coerced by something other than battery, \nsomething like economics, maybe even something like love” (Feminism Unmodified 88). \nMany coercive and social pressures contribute to a violation beyond brute force. These \npressures include economics, religion, manipulation, status, and more. Non-feminist laws \nstem from the misconceptions of rape myths and household social norms regarding \nsexualized violence. When the law erects from one image of a violation, it prohibits the \nrecognition of any variation beyond that one form. This jurisprudence constricts the variety of \nsexual violations and acts as a further injustice against the victims. Beyond rape, laws \ncontinue to be narrow and restrictive to the experiences of sexualized crimes. Additionally, \nintersectionality is integral to approach oppression and injustice (Crenshaw). Beyond gender, \nclass, race, religion, and ethnicity, identities intersect and contribute to the treatment and \n9 \nexperience of individuals (Kline 141). Laws should extend a broad scope to account for \nintersectionality. \nEnacting feminist jurisprudence has significant effects on society. Recently, a \nsignificant victory for human rights and addressing sexualized violence was criminalizing \nsexual harassment in The United States. The legal recognition of sexual harassment as a \ncrime proved the success of taking a “women's experience of violation seriously enough to \ndesign a law around it” (MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified 103). Women who experienced \nsexual harassment demanded legislative reform to recognize this injustice. This legal \nrecognition directly addresses the problem of sexualized violence and continues to influence \nsocial change. This represents the effectiveness of laws created by those who experience an \ninjustice (MacKinnon, Feminism Unmodified 105). Laws are a mode of the agency to protect \noneself from harm, and they provide the ability to change social norms that fuel violations. \nAdoption and creation of more feminist laws will protect and uplift individual lives. \nBeyond feminist framing, scholars debate the effectiveness of legislation in creating \nsocial change. History demonstrates how social norms can change, organically and through \nlaws. Norms “rest on a community's beliefs about what is appropriate for an actor under some \nspecific condition,” which influence national and international laws (Frieden 469). These \nbeliefs can evolve over time and through legal reform. Communities are built upon norms \nand understand them as standards of behavior. Identifying norms can be difficult, especially \nwhen they are absent from the law; norms are internalized and produced through free will. \nInternational norms exist as universal morals and bases for human rights. When governments \nviolate norms, citizens protest and demand change (Frieden 480). These powerful national \nnorms, pressures, and moral obligations drive nations to sign international laws and enact \nnational change to promote peace.  \n10 \nMany scholars contribute to this debate and critique the effectiveness of creating \nchange through laws. The “hollow hope” theory, coined by Gerald Rosenberg, argues against \nthe influence courts have on social change. This theory views the courts as “constrained,” and \nhaving little effect without outside pressures and influences. Rosenberg finds little evidence \nthat court cases are responsible for social change alone when evaluating women's rights court \ncases in The United States. His results show a lack of change of public opinion on abortions \nin as a consequence of the ruling in Roe v Wade. He finds the highest increase in abortions \nbefore the decision of the court case, invalidating the cases direct responsibility for social \nchange regarding abortions. This argument takes the stance that the courts follow and adapt \nto social changes, not the other way around (Rosenberg 179). In addition, the focus should be \non the many contributing factors to change, not only the courts. However, this viewpoint is \ncriticized for lacking distance and for misguided examination. The hollow hope theory is \ncritiqued for only looking at immediate direct social responses to legislative reform (Schultz). \nLaws can “grant legitimacy to certain claims and to redefine norms of institutional action” \n(Schultz 74). Laws legitimize social changes and contribute to social reform. In addition, \nimportant social debate arises from court decisions and influences public opinion. However, \nthis scholarly work prompts an effective shift from legislation to focusing on the power of \nsocial organizing and activism.  \nNongovernmental and grassroots organizations use collective action to create \ninstitutional, political, and social reform. Local organization is an integral space for \nprotesting injustices and demanding action. Civic engagement is essential in influencing \nsocial, political, and economic reform (Wandersman 232). Change is possible when \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) work with international actors to put pressure on \nnational governments (Wandersman 234). Grassroot movements and NGOs influence global \nand domestic reform, which is particularly compelling for women's and human rights (Geske \n11 \n89). Social movements and local organization “affects policy change and is essential to the \ndevelopment of progressive social politics” (Weldon 245). Civil mobilization puts pressure \non policy-makers to reform legislation that will lead to positive changes in public opinion. \nSexualized violence stems from institutional and social inequality. To influence significant \nchanges in the private and public spheres, NGOs advocate for international action and legal \nreform (Geske 90). NGOs demand attention from the international community, which \npressures nations from above and produces change over time. International conventions often \narise from NGO pressure. Equality and sexualized violence is advocated locally and \nlegitimized through international conventions and treaties, which together influence \nsignificant political and social change over time.  \nInternational treaties address global conflicts by binding countries together to end \nconflict and promote a more peaceful world. These treaties are agreements made during \ninternational conventions concerning conflicts. States sign and adopt international law for \nmany reasons, including public pressure, moral motivation, and self-interest. However, \npersonal interest is the driving force for ratification. Most international treaties require \nnational adoption, which is costly and unfavorable. The effectiveness of international treaties \nin creating change is widely debated.  \nInternational treaties approach conflict and injustice by influencing international \ncooperation. Collective action facilitates understandings and agreements over “unifying \nprinciples” (Frieden 459). There are two main types of international laws; customary \ninternational law, which develops slowly after recognizing norms; and international treaties, \nwhich generally take place in a convention and are ratified by states. When a country ratifies \nand signs international law, they are bound by the terms and restraints of the treaty. However, \none of the most significant flaws in international treaties is the lack of enforcement and \nuniversal adoption. Because these laws reflect the public interest, the nations that sign them, \n12 \nhave incentives to uphold them. When nations ratify international human rights treaties, they \ngenerally enact similar national changes and comply with the terms of the treaty (Von Stein). \nHowever, problems of enforcement arise because of the many conflicting interests of \ndifferent states. Many reasons contribute to a nations decision to sign international treaties \nand the majority stem from personal interest. Nations comply to treaties when they have \npersonal interests in doing so, whether it is from belief in the cause, fear of collateral \nconsequences, or individual incentives (Hathaway, \"Why do countries commit”). These direct \nand indirect benefits of ratification support nations to comply with the terms.  \nInternational relations theory provides different predictions for the effectiveness of \nratifying countries: normative theory supports effective change, realist theory predicts no \nchange, institutionalism expects better practices to be associated with ratification, and \nliberalism anticipates a sufficient change in democracies and not other forms of government \n(Hathaway, “Do human rights” 1965). Looking at human rights treaties, nations that ratify \nthese treaties have better practices than states who do not ratify. However, the results do not \ndetermine whether treaty ratification is responsible for better practices or if the factors that \nlead to ratification, including the nation's positive human rights practices, are responsible \n(Hathaway, “Do human rights” 1989). Overall, quantitative results do not support the \ncausation of treaty ratification leading to better human rights practices overall. Against what \nthe theories predict, countries who ratify are found to be less likely to comply with the \ntreaties that countries who do not ratify (Hathaway, “Do human rights” 1989). Similarly, \nsometimes those with the lowest human rights practices are more likely to ratify these treaties \nthan those with existing human rights practices (Hathaway, “Do human rights” 1999). With \ngenocide and torture conventions specifically, ratification of treaties is associated with worse \npractices (Hathaway, “Do human rights” 1999). Although counterintuitive, quantitative \n13 \nanalysis of human rights treaties does not find a strong relationship between ratification and \nbetter human rights practices. Some possible reasons and factors contribute to these results.  \nThese findings lack a significant focus on the long-term impact of treaty influence. \nMany factors contribute to minimal change after ratification. First, nations may not enact \ninstitutional reform because there is no enforcement or monitoring post-ratification. Also, \nnations often aspire to comply but are unable to make the institutional changes effectively. \nOn the other hand, many ratifying countries make national changes, which generates other \nnations to follow. In addition, democracies are unlikely to make changes with treaty \nratification because their institutions already uphold human rights. In the end, treaties are a \nclear framework for “perceptions of what constitutes acceptable behavior” (Hathaway, “Do \nhuman rights” 2021). The influence of the treaty effects states whether or not they ratify. \nAlthough costly, significant results follow through more enforcement and pressure to comply \nwith international treaties.  \nInternational jurisprudence is an approach that will help end sexualized violence \nglobally over time. Although there are many possible solutions, international treaties are \nvisible and influential in their declaration. Whether nations ratify or ignore the treaty, all \nnations are exposed to the standard of behavior the international community wants to display \nand demand. Some countries may never change their practices, but having these treaties \npromotes necessary social change condemning this injustice. Comprehensive and feminist \ninternational treaties promote standards of behavior for the world to adjust to. In addition, \nwhen women's groups organize nationally, international legislation supports their cause. \nActivism succeeds when supported by international recognition of their purpose. Over \nsignificant time, international laws supporting and empowering women will provide agency \nfor this necessary change. International law can provide essential support for a local \n14 \norganizing activist causes to succeed and influence normative changes over time, ending this \ninjustice, one individual at a time.  \nMethodology \nThis project works to show the effectiveness of international treaties on ending \nsexualized violence globally. Analysis of The Convention on Elimination and Discrimination \nAgainst Women (CEDAW) and Bosnia and Herzegovina, develop on the previous scholarly \nwork. CEDAW illustrates the shortcomings and benefits of ratification. The case study of \nBosnia and Herzegovina supports the ratification of CEDAW to produce political and social \nchange. The study of the post-war country also emphasizes the atrocities of sexualized \nviolence during and post-war. In addition, CEDAW ratification in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nshows the power of social change and the empowerment of women over time. Together, the \nlegal analysis and case study support the effectiveness of international treaties in addressing \nand ending global sexualized violence over time. \nSolving global sexualized violence is an enormous task, and if there were a clear \nsolution, this problem would not be as immanent. Because of the nuanced nature of this issue, \nthere are countless approaches available. This is one possible approach and should not be the \nonly attempt at addressing and solving this problem.  \nAnalysis of CEDAW \nThere exist over sixty international treaties from the United Nations, beginning in the \nlate 19th Century to promote peace. The major international treaty focusing on ending \nviolence against women resulted from the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms \nof Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The well-known Declaration of Human Rights \ntreaty did not explicitly account for the treatment of women and children, which prompted \nthe creation of CEDAW. CEDAW is commonly known as the international bill of rights for \n15 \nwomen and denounces gender discrimination (“UN General Assembly”). The treaty serves to \nprotect women and children from violence and human rights injustices. In ratifying this \nconvention, nations agree to enact national institutional changes compliant with the terms of \nCEDAW. Although many countries have ratified, The United States, Japan, and China stand \nalongside others, as non-ratifying states. By not ratifying, these powerful countries make a \npowerful statement against the autonomy of women.  \nBecause all nations have different ethics and human rights standards, implementation \nand adoption of international treaties are challenging to enforce. The international community \nendows human rights for all humans: regardless of status or identity, just because one is a \nhuman being (Frieden 493). The general universal norm of “perpetrating violence against \ninnocent persons” is generally condemned as wrong and immoral universally (Frieden 477). \nHowever, violence continues to exist globally. CEDAW makes significant efforts to end \nviolence against women by declaring specific definitions to the international community. \nThese definitions serve as the universal standard to facilitate communication and collect \naction. The convention defines discrimination against women as, \"...any distinction, \nexclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing \nor nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital \nstatus, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms \nin the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field\" (“UN General Assembly”). \nIn signing CEDAW, a government acknowledges this as the official definition and agrees to \ntake all national measures to end gender discrimination and ensure the advancement of \nwomen.  \nThe treaty addresses discrimination in six distinct and purposeful parts. After the \nintroduction, part one address discrimination, policy requirements, human rights, and \nprejudice. This portion goes further to denounce human trafficking and exploitation of \n16 \nwomen through prostitution. Part two address the need for equality in the political sphere \nthrough political rights, representation, and nationality. Part three addresses education, \nemployment, health care, economic equality, social equality, and specifically the \nempowerment of rural women. Part four address the law and marriage. Sections five and six \ndetail the committee responsibilities and plans for revisions and disputes. \nComprehensive and detailed, the contents of each section of the document illustrate \nthe requirements for signatories to uphold and modify through their institutions. National \nlegislation, regulations, customs, and practices that do not protect the rights of women must \nbe changed, rejected, and replaced with non-discriminatory policies. In addition, it requires \nnew initiates to be implemented to protect and establish the legal rights of women. Article \nThree declares that signatories must take all measures, including legislatively, “to ensure the \nfull development and advancement of women, for guaranteeing them the exercise and \nenjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms based on equality with men,” \npolitically, economically, socially, legislatively, and culturally (“UN General Assembly”). \nSignatories must make efforts to not only uplift the equality of women politically through \ngovernmental institutions but also in the private and social spheres. Article Nine ensures that \nwomen cannot be left stateless, specifically if a woman marries an undocumented man or that \nman changes his nationality, the woman must still have her stateship. In terms of education, \nCEDAW declares that women must have equal opportunity for education. Article Ten grants \nwomen universal opportunities and the right to work as men. Article Eleven requires job \nsecurity through maternity leave and prohibits discrimination in the workplace because of \nmarital or maternity status. Healthcare service access, including family planning, must be \ngranted to all women. Anything beyond the phrase “family planning” is not detailed. Social \nsecurity, economic services, recreational, and sports opportunities must also be free from \ndiscrimination. Marriage is required to be registered, and the government must set a legal age \n17 \nlimit for marriage. This age is not determined by the document. In addition, the rights of \nspouses must be equal between spouses. The gendered language is omitted from article \nsixteen regarding marriage rights. Overall, political and civil rights must not discriminate \nagainst gender. The document ends with procedures and requirements for the CEDAW \ncommittee and The United Nations. There are systems in place in case of disputes or \nconflicting interpretations of the text, but there lacks specific detail for reinforcement or \npunishment in the case that a ratifying country does not comply. However, the report \nprovides a standard for countries to strive towards.  \nIn the total of 197 countries, 109 countries have signed and ratified as a state party, 13 \nare signatories, and 75 countries have taken no action. The United States, China, India, \nEgypt, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iraq, Israel, and Japan lead the list of states \nwho have not acted. Among these strong states follow most of the Middle East, many \ncountries in Africa, and some South American countries (“Status of Ratification”). The \ndocument requires all ratifying states to make appropriate reforms to uphold the Convention \nand eliminate discrimination against women. It also requires all institutions to reflect the \ncontents of the document domestically, including the equality of men and women to equal \naccess in all public and private spheres. CEDAW serves to be a universal code to protect and \nuplift the human rights of women but has difficulties in enforcement and widespread \nadoption.  \n The United States stands out not only as the single western democracy and as one of \nthe most powerful countries that have not ratified CEDAW. Opponents of CEDAW support \nthis decision and argue that U.S. ratification would not lead to more international aid or \ndomestic change, instead it would only act as a formality (Munson). The United States takes \nmeasures to provide foreign assistance and makes domestic efforts to uphold the equality of \nwomen without ratifying. In 1980 President Carter signed the treaty, but this was rejected by \n18 \nthe Senate (Munson). The U.S. has many reasons for their dismissal of the document, mainly \na lack of alignment with their interests and agendas. Another concern for the U.S. in ratifying \nthe Convention is the necessary reforms to domestic law that would be necessary \n(Halberstam 57). However, U.S. ratification would bring power and legitimacy to the treaty, \ninfluencing others to ratify and uphold the document. International visibility is powerful and \nthe U.S. ratifying CEDAW would be influential for change.  \nThe effects of CEDAW are contested, and little scholarly work shows the \neffectiveness of CEDAW in producing better policies and practices for empowering women \nglobally. As an international treaty, CEDAW is generally marginalized and acts as a subset of \nThe Universal Declaration of Human rights, which fails to explicitly detail the treatment and \ndiscrimination of women (Weldon). Opponents criticize the treaty for lack of enforcement, \ndomestic policy requirements, and committee composition (Munson). Also, it is difficult to \ndetermine the direct effects of ratification of CEDAW, primarily because of the lack of \ninternational enforcement (Hill). Although there is not much research specifically on \nCEDAW’s effects, the work that exits generally supports minimal effectiveness overall.  \nCEDAW is most effective alongside national feminist activism. A study examined 70 \ncountries from 1975 to 2005 and found that the contributing force to national policy change \nreflecting CEDAW, was strong national feminist activism (Weldon). Feminist activism is \neffective in pressuring national changes when backed by CEDAW. There are three main \nfactors for this finding. First, feminist organizing produces visualization and educates the \npublic on the issue. Second, feminist activism challenges normative gender constructions in \nsociety. Finally, these issues place pressure on a nation to enact policy and institutional \nchanges from social demand (Weldon). This activism also calls into question the lack of \ninstitutional reform from their nation as required by the ratification of CEDAW. CEDAW can \nsupport effective national change when combined with social demand. Strong national \n19 \nfeminist movements in nations who ratify CEDAW, pressure the government to implement \ninstitutional change (Weldon 245).   \nCEDAW is successful overall in producing statistically significant effects on women's \npolitical rights. A quantitative study finds significant positive results in the political rights of \nwomen, slightly less effective social rights, and having no impact on economic equality for \nratifying states (Englehart). These findings result from CEDAW requiring a change in public \nand private spheres, as well as, “the minds of individuals” (Englehart). The effectiveness of \nCEDAW in producing effective political change for women supports successful systematic \nempirical results for international treaties effects on human rights (Englehart). Like most \nresearch on international treaties, time is required for the impact to take place and be noticed. \nA more comprehensive understanding of CEDAW’s impact requires more time to understand \nits full effect.   \nThese findings support the positive effect CEDAW has on influencing better practices \nfor women's empowerment and equality. To accomplish this goal, the United States needs to \nratify CEDAW. As a leading nation, this will signal a stronger standard for treatment of \nwomen globally. Although the United States takes its own measures to empower women, \nparticipating internationally with CEDAW will add validation to the scope of the document. \nHowever, even without the support of the United States, CEDAW can support grassroots \nwomen's activism and reflect changes internationally. When women organize nationally for \nthemselves, they are more powerful when CEDAW, or accompanying international \nlegislation, provides support. Although the effects of CEDAW require more time to pass to \nfully understand its power, its existence empowers and strengthens national women's \norganization. CEDAW provides agency for successful activism to influence institutional and \nsocial reform, slowly empowering women and ending sexualized violence.  \n20 \nCase Study: Bosnia and Herzegovina \nBosnia and Herzegovina illuminates the effectiveness of international treaties on \ncreating national reform to end sexualized violence. Bosnia and Herzegovina, commonly \nreferred to as BiH, is a new country formed from the breakup of the Former Yugoslavia and \nthe aftermath of the horrific Bosnian War. The Bosnian War was a genocide that occurred \nofficially between 1992 and 1995 (Belloni 15). After the former Yugoslavia broke up when \nthe states declared their desire to secede, Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, declared war \nagainst the Muslim people. The strategic use of violence, including various tactics of \nsexualized violence, fueled the genocide (Stiglmayer). The sexualized violence in this \ngenocide is known as “war rape.” This war rape existed to directly “inflict trauma” and \ndestroy family units, which became a crucial component of ethnic cleansing (Diken 111). \nRape was an essential tool for ethnic cleansing and a sex-specific torture campaign against \nwomen. Having generational effects on the population and ethnic composition of BiH, \npregnancy was a consequence of this war. There is an estimate of between 20,000, and \n50,000 reported rapes, and more unreported, from the war (Diken 112). Slobodan Milošević \nordered an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Muslim Bosnians by implementing rape \ncamps, sadistic torture, and more.  \nThis war demonstrates the many horrific forms sexualized violence takes. Gruesome \nacts of violence deployed with the intent to kill and destroy individuals, physically and \nemotionally. Accounts show that family members were forced to rape one another or be \nforced to watch their family raped as an act of violent aggression. This violence had \nimmediate and lasting effects on all the surviving individuals. Rape in the war left lasting \nphysical, emotional, religious, and spiritual injuries (Diken 113). Similarly, the aftermath of \nthe war created a society of people directly affected and traumatized by sexualized violence. \nAlthough women were the target, many men and children experienced these horrific \n21 \nviolations. Rape in BiH “had as its purpose to destroy an ethnic group by killing it, to prevent \nits reproduction or to disorganize it, removing it from its home soil” (Diken 115). In BiH, \nMuslim women were targeted to impregnate to change the population ethnically. Serbian \nsoldiers raped and violated non-Serbian women, directly dividing ethnic communities and \nproducing only Serbian children (Handrahan 437). Ethnic cleansing intended to end the \nbloodline of the Muslim Bosnian population. Forced rape served to “inflict trauma” and \ndestroy families. Rape in this war strategically targeted social structures and created \ndestruction by creating a new composition of ethnic communities. This posed problems for \nthe aftermath of the war, physically and socially. Religion played a role in the aftermath, as \nMuslim women had to deal with the acts not only physically and emotionally, but also \nreligiously. Rape in this war was used to disrupt the ethnic and religious makeup of the \ncommunities (Diken 116). Examining personal testimonies shows the tremendous effect this \nwar and sexualized violence had on individuals. People interviewed, defined the war violence \nas “morally reprehensible” (Basic). Similar to other post-war societies, the aftermath \nincluded, shame, a decrease in a population of people, hostility between groups, and \nemotional and physical scars.  \nThe war was fueled through the consumption and violence against women’s bodies \nbecause they were women. These acts directly violated international human rights laws and \ntook an alarming amount of time to end through international intervention. The atrocities of \nthe conflict in BiH provide context for the harm, severity, and threat sexualized violence has \non human rights. The conflict ended through the Dayton Accords, which was the \ninternational intervention in Dayton, Ohio of the United States in 1995. The presidents of \nBosnia, Croatia, and Serbia and mediated by the United States under President Bill Clinton’s \npresidency, ended with the separation of new countries. The Former Yugoslavia broke up and \nBiH, established as its own country, began to build itself back up from the war.  \n22 \nExamining post-war BiH as a case study supports the effects of CEDAW and the \ndevelopment of empowering women globally. BiH under the Former Yugoslavia signed and \nratified CEDAW in 1980 and 1982. With the fall of the state of Yugoslavia in 1992, the new \nstate of BiH established in 1995 (“Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Development \nIndicators”). BiH took on the legal obligation of the former Yugoslavia in September of \n1993. This succession has the equivalent legal obligation as ratification and is merely a \nhistorical formality. At the peak of the war, the Dayton Accords mediated peace and helped \nprovide necessary resources to rebuild a new nation. The Dayton Accords settlement did not \nspecifically address issues of gender and sexualized violence (Pupavac). This is notable when \nexamining the construction and development of the new state. Political, social, and economic \nrights are the areas of focus for reviewing public and private sphere development after \nratifying CEDAW and post-war BiH.  \nBiH continues to struggle with the balance of implementing democratic values while \npreserving its culture. New threats to human rights arose in BiH post-war. The \nimplementation of political rights and peacebuilding efforts post-war were not immediately \nsuccessful. Not uncommon to many peacebuilding and peacekeeping missions, soldiers and \npeacekeepers sent to ensure peace in BiH perpetrated more harm. They exploited the post-\nwar state of BiH and violated human rights, through rape, human trafficking, and other forms \nof sexualized violence on citizens (Rošul-Gajić). United Nations operatives disobeyed their \nown prerogatives and motives by committing injustices against Bosnian people. However, the \nUN operatives left and with more time, women's groups and women's NGOs have put \npressure on the BiH government to implement normative and institutional changes to support \nthe empowerment of women.  \nBiH has a rich history of religion, culture, and ethnic diversity. Bosnian, Croatian, and \nSerbian are all three national languages (Kolouh-Westin). Because the war was perpetrated \n23 \nthrough ethnic cleansing, and religious and cultural divisions, the post-war construction is \nfollowed with lasting divisions (Handrahan). Serbian soldiers raped non-Serbian women, \nleaving effects on ethnic communities and family structures. The cultural diversity of the \ncountry poses obstacles for institutional and social reform. It is integral for the non-western \nculture of BiH be preserved while making strides towards gender equality in the public and \nprivate spheres. Additionally, intersectionality must be upheld and understood when \nexamining the treatment of women and overall human rights. State building efforts post-war \nwere implemented under compliance with CEDAW and other international human rights \ntreaties, to empower women and create equality in all aspects of life in public and private \nspheres: economic, political, and social. \nSupporting the previously stated theories, the economic opportunity and equality of \nwomen in BiH is minimal. According to the World Bank, the economy of BiH continues to \nface challenges due to its economic model. As of 2016, the population of BiH is 3.8 million \npeople with a life expectancy of 77.1 years (“Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Development \nIndicators”). Unemployment is high and economic opportunity is low, especially for women. \nOnly 35.6% of the employed population are women, while the population capable of working \nis 51.7% of the population (“UN Committee on CEDAW”). This is a low percentage of \nworking women for the greater geographic area. There are many reasons for this finding, and \nmost stem from the former social divisions systematic for the economy of the previous \nregime. In addition, the war produced many widows who are disadvantaged as women \nsocially, and economically. Widowship is followed by lower social class status and fewer job \nopportunities (Handrahan 435). Although legislation was implemented to empower women in \nall aspects of BiH life, equality in the economic sphere is a slow ascend, paralleling the \noverall countries economic status.  \n24 \nFollowing the construction of a new country, BiH has made many political, \ninstitutional reforms to generate equality. The BiH parliament implemented many changes to \ncreate political equality. In 2003, the Bosnian parliament passed the Gender Equality Law \n(GEL) to enhance institutional reform to promote gender equality (“Law on Gender Equality \nin B-H”). Created in response to CEDAW, GEL serves to advocate for justice by prohibiting \ngender discrimination in public and private spheres. The national law mimics and parallels \nthe conventions of CEDAW in many ways. The law states its purpose to “regulate, promote \nand protect gender equality, guarantee equal opportunities and equal treatment of all persons \nregardless of gender in public and private sphere of society, and regulate protection from \ndiscrimination on grounds of gender” (“Law on Gender Equality in BiH Consolidated \nVersion”). The comprehensive and detailed legislation prohibits discrimination based on sex, \nand grants equality between men and women. Within the law, policies grant the right to equal \naccess to resources including healthcare, education, employment, social welfare and sport, \nand cultural opportunities. The law is compliant with the terms of CEDAW and democratic in \nits structure. An interesting component is from Article 20, which declares that representation \nin government institutions must promote equality, which is at least 40% representation of \ngender. Overall the law is liberal and progressive with its aspirations to eliminate \ndiscrimination and promote equality in all phases of life. Legislatively, the country has made \nstrides to empower women politically. As scholarly work showed, this does not guarantee \nequality in the other spheres of life. Examining the social changes of women in BiH will \nhelps to unpack this discrepancy.  \nIn compliance with the terms of the Dayton Accords agreement, BiH held its first \nelections for parliament in 1996, with the hope to empower women in the political sphere. \nThe first election of 1996 elected only one woman for a total of 57 seats (“Parliamentary \nAssembly”). Although this is a small portion of representation, this is a significant success \n25 \ncompared to the previous political equality and representation. The BiH parliament is divided \ninto the House of Representatives (42 seats) and the House of People (15 seats), with 57 total \nelected members. The seven elections since 1996 have seen the following number of women \nelected to parliament: 1, 9, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12. Currently, the 2014-2018 parliament is 78% men \nand 21% women: 45 men and 12 women (“Parliamentary Assembly”). Although still \nunderrepresented, the gender makeup difference from the first election to the current seventh \nis a significant increase in the empowerment of women in the political sphere. However, \nmany factors contribute to this low participation of women in the BiH parliament. First, BiH \nis a new country existing only over two decades. Not only does the implementation of \npolitical equality take time, but the sentiments of the former regime and sexist norms of the \nculture also continue to exist. The lack of women in parliament is both due to women not \ngetting enough votes from citizens to win and a lack of women running for election in \ngeneral. The sexist and dividing norms from the regime of the Former Yugoslavia and the \nhorrific events of the Bosnian war persist. In addition, quotas for gender and identity \nparticipation in politics are avoided due to the negative communist associations from earlier \nhistory (Brunnbauer 157). Party caucuses and party affiliation contribute to this inequality. \nMany political parties prioritize their own representation overproducing and empowering \nwomen candidates. Strategy for political party representation contributes heavily to the \nmakeup of candidates. BiH women are increasingly participating in NGO’s and other \nwomen's groups outside of official political institutions (Brunnbauer). This NGO sector, \nmainly run by women is gaining traction and address women's issues. This area is a space for \nwomen to influence the political institutions in their own space. Although the economic and \npolitical institutions have more work to accomplish, equality in the social sphere is critically \nimportant to examine. Social empowerment has exceeded the strides of economic and \npolitical institutions for women, but still has the opportunity for more reform.  \n26 \nQuality of education and health care have had successes and failures in BiH. \nEducation continued through the war but produced significantly lower standards of quality. \nBiH introduced private schools post-war. However, the national curriculum has not evolved \nas quickly as national legislation has. The post-war curriculum adopted new values such as \npromoting and introducing free markets, foreign languages, computer science, special \nprograms for learning disabilities, devaluing socialism, and an overall focus on individuals, \nrather than the collective (Kolouh-Westin). Generally, the female to male ratio enrolling in \nschool is close to equal. In 2008/2009, pre-school had 47.7% female enrolment, whereas \nvocational secondary schools, traditionally for male students, has 34% female enrollment \n(“UN Committee on CEDAW”). The type of primary and secondary school varies and \ncontributes to widespread results for female enrollment. Overall, there is generally an equal \nopportunity to education, but BiH has areas to improve by promoting female enrollment and \nempowerment. In addition to education, health care continues to struggle to evolve towards \nequality in BiH. Legislation endows equal access to health care regardless of gender; \nhowever, contributing factors such as rural and vulnerable women’s opportunities are \ndisadvantaged (“UN Committee on CEDAW”). Strategic Plan Development of Health \nService in BiH is working to implement better practices and opportunity for women’s health \ncare, including contraceptives, cervical and breast cancer treatment, and reproductive health \n(“UN Committee on CEDAW”). The Human Development Reports find positive general \ntrends for life expectancy and suicide rates. Life expectancy started at 72.3 in 1996 and has \nsteadily increased to 77.1 by 2017 (“Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Development \nIndicators”). Suicide women per 100,000 people went from 3.5 in 2000 to 1.9 in 2015. For \nmen, went from 14.7 in 2000 to 7.1 in 2015 (“Bosnia and Herzegovina Human Development \nIndicators”). These trends represent positive changes for individuals over time. The education \n27 \nand health care in BiH have made strides but still, have more to do to uphold equal \nopportunity and equality for all. Political and social justice will continue to evolve with time.  \nPersonal accounts and testimonies about social changes report on the effects and \ndevelopment of empowerment within the private sphere. Scholar Cynthia Cockburn, speaks \nto the evolution of equality from her visits to the Medica Women's Therapy Centre in BiH, in \n1995 and again in 2012. The center began as a feminist health care center for women and \nsurvivors of sexualized violence in the war: rape, torture, loss, and more. In her visit \nseventeen years later, the center evolved from treating the war violence to addressing \ndomestic violence, non-conflict rape, and harassment. In addition, women were now seeking \nhelp to escape prostitution they had been coerced and forced into. Forced prostitution often \nfollows post-conflict communities for economic necessity (Handrahan 434). The feminist \nmedical center shifted its needs from war traumas to the post-conflict forms of sexualized \nviolence, including domestic violence and forced enslavement. This shift in functionality in \nthe center reflects the development of needs and problems of sexualized violence in the post-\nwar country. One woman from the center, Meliha Branković, gave testimony to her \nperspective on the difference in gender relations in the country. She reports that in one way, \nthe youth culture promotes freedom and an “escape from the restrictions of pre-communist, \ncommunist and nationalist gender relations.” However, on the other hand, she notes, the \n“contemporary youth culture in Bosnia as manifesting a specifically capitalist form of \npatriarchy, one in which women are no longer idealized as socialist ‘workers,’ nor are \nnational ‘mothers’” (Cockburn). In one way women are liberated from the Yugoslav \ncommunist restrictions on women; however, through this liberation, young women evolve \nthrough a new capitalist patriarchal power. Although there is progression from the communist \noppression of women, a new type of struggle forms from the democratization of the country. \nThe democratization of BiH lead to the construction of patriarchal structures, previously \n28 \nobsolete to the culture. Although there have been significant strides in the empowerment of \nwomen, new threats entered the social sphere.  \nAlthough the social equality of women continues to struggle, supportive feminist \ncommunities developed and are thriving. Surviving sexualized violence is not the end of \noppression imposed on individuals. The social shame and harm that comes from survival are \nsignificantly harmful (Handrahan 435). However, in post-war construction, women of both \nethnic and oppressed sides are shown to support one another. There exists a \"female gender \nidentity linked to peacebuilding” (Handrahan 439). An alliance between Serb and non-\nSerbian women within the country has been created and serves to be the future of \nempowerment of Bosnian women.  \nWomen’s NGOs and feminist groups are responsible for many institutional and social \nchanges in BiH. They put pressure on the government as collective groups of women, which \nalong with legislation to support them, made women's issues on national agenda (Rošul-\nGajić). The vocalization of these NGOs and groups have caught the attention of international \nand domestic actors. NGO work together with national authorities and international actors \nfueled important gender and peace security policy, mainly in policy reform and adoption \n(Rošul-Gajić). Bosnian women's NGOs existed during the war and found success once they \ngained national and international visibility and support (Rošul-Gajić. 154). National funds \nand international organizations support BiH NGO work. In 2004, the national SOS hotline \n1209 opened for support and protection of victims of family violence (“Global Database on \nViolence against Women”). Following the national line, four NGO’s, Udružene žene-Banja \nLuka, Budućnost-Modriča, Association of Women Lara-Bijeljina and Ženski centar-Trebinje, \noperate the emergency hotline 1264, created in 2005 (“UN Committee on CEDAW”). This \nSOS line serves the area of Republika Srpska, assisting victims of domestic violence and \nother sexualized violence. For line 1264, there were 11,8808 calls from 2006-2009, \n29 \nincreasing until a decline of calls in 2009. In 2006, 97.4% of the calls were from women \n(“UN Committee on CEDAW”). Another NGO runs hotline 1209 in Istočno Sarajevo, \nproviding 24-hour help for a wide scope of issues. These NGOs work to support victims of \nsexualized violence in BiH with external support and funds from international organizations \nand state resources (“Global Database on Violence against Women”). Bosnian women group \ntogether to support one another through these NGO spaces to empower women and advocate \nfor social, political, and economic equality. \nAlthough the effects of CEDAW on the development of BiH is widespread, a \nconclusion can be made in regards to women's empowerment: the organizing of Bosnian \nwomen with support from international legislation promotes pressure on national institutions \nto create change. BiH made national efforts to implement compliant laws with CEDAW \nnationally. However, enforcing and implementing feminist legislation was not a fast nor an \nefficient process. Post-war reconstruction met significant inequality and hardship. The \ndemocratization of BiH left the old cultural forms of ethnic and gendered oppression while \nadopting new discriminations and hierarchical divisions associated with capitalism and \npatriarchy. Modern alliances between Bosnian women of all identities and status’ lead to \nnational reform and empowerment of women with the backing of CEDAW and other \nlegislation. When Bosnian women worked together, they gained political power to promote \ntheir voice and cause. With more time, women in NGO space will succeed in advocating for \nsocial and political change to empower women and end sexualized violence.  \nConclusion \nInternational treaties effectively create incremental change in ending global \nsexualized violence. CEDAW influences national reform to empower women and change the \nnorms that fuel sexualized violence. Over time, gradual development will lead to greater \nrespect for individual autonomy. Examining the successfulness of CEDAW and the state-\n30 \nbuilding efforts of BiH, support this finding. CEDAW is not universally effective alone at \nending global sexualized violence. In some nations, with ratification, CEDAW is influential \nby pressuring national legislative and institutional reforms. In other countries, CEDAW has \nlittle or no effect on national changes. However, CEDAW is most effective in supporting \nlocal activism against gendered and sexualized injustices. The evolution of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina demonstrates the possibility of success for political and social change. As a non-\nwestern nation, this diverse country has difficulties implementing democratizing changes \nwhile preserving their culture. The country will continue to evolve and strive for better \nstandards and norms over time. BiH has empowered women through the law, granting equal \nrights in compliance with CEDAW. However, this has not taken immediate effect. Women \ncontinue to struggle to find employment, have opportunities for health care, and more. \nWomen can run for elected office and participate equally in the political sphere; however, \nthere has not been a wave of women candidates. The culture and norms of the past are still in \nexistence, but through women's groups and NGOs, Bosnian women created a new sphere to \nvoice themselves. With legislation to back them, these women can put pressure on their \nnational government to make the appropriate political changes. It may require significant \ntime to see and experience the full effects of this, but this successful empowerment is \npowerful and consequential to equality, slowly ending gendered and sexualized violence.  \nInternational treaties influence necessary incremental social and political change by \naddressing and condemning sexualized violence. CEDAW continues to empower women \nglobally to change norms that fuel sexualized violence. With continued ratification from \nmore nations, CEDAW will continue to address the world and promote standards of behavior \nnecessary for protecting individual autonomy. As social change follows legislative measures, \nsexualized violence will dissipate over significant time. Sexualized violence is a deep threat \n31 \nto universal personal autonomy, and any incremental change is substantial and meaningful to \nindividual lives.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n32 \nWorks Cited \nBasic, Goran. \"Definitions of violence: narratives of survivors from the war in Bosnia \nand Herzegovina.\" Journal of interpersonal violence 33.13 (2018): 2073-2097. \nBelloni, Roberto.

    "abstract": "Sexualized violence continues to threaten the autonomy of individuals and violate human rights. Scholars debate the effectiveness of international treaties in addressing this problem. The Convention on Elimination and Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) of 1979 requires ratifying countries to uplift equality and denounce discrimination of women nationally, in public and private spheres. Examining Bosnia and Herzegovina as a case study shows the effectiveness CEDAW has in creating political and social change. In addition, the Bosnian War illustrates the threat sexualized violence has on individual autonomy. Findings show that CEDAW and grassroots feminist activism are successful together in advocating for social and political change. These results support the power of international treaties when combined with grassroots support for the cause. Over time, social change is possible as a consequence of international jurisprudence, which will help end sexualized violence globally, one individual at a time",
