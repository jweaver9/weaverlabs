Bernstein ABSTRACT Sexual Orientation, Age, and Race: An Intersectional Approach to Health Disparities Laura E. Bernstein  Sexual orientation, age, and race are all identity-based variables that can contribute to health disparities (Dannefer, 2020; Meyer, 2003; Forde et al., 2019). The minority diminished returns (MDR) theory states that marginalized identities (i.e. race and sexual orientation) dampen the positive impact education has on physical and mental health (Assari, 2018). Some evidence suggests that health disparities narrow in older sexual minority adults (Nelson & Andel, 2020a) but this question has not been asked with nationally representative data, and research with older sexual minorities is limited. The present study explored whether 1) age dampens or exacerbates disparities in self-rated health due to sexual orientation and 2) multiple marginalized identities (sexual orientation, age, and race) interact with education in their influence on health. The study utilized data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from the CDC with an overall sample size of 167, 508. Structural equation modeling (SEM) found that lesbian/gay, bisexual, and “other” sexual minority identities were associated with worse overall health and these associations were significantly smaller in participants over the age of 50 than those younger than 50. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) found a significant education by sexual orientation by race interaction for number of poor physical and mental health days. Investigation into the means found that White bisexual and “other” sexual minorities with low education had the worse mental and physical health, respectively. However, Black and Hispanic individuals of the same sexual orientation and education had elevated, though slightly lower number of poor health days. These findings suggest that 1) sexual minority individuals might be developing resilience in the face of their minority stress as they age and 2) examining race, sexual orientation, and education together can highlight health disparities not seen when looking at these variables independently.

First, I would like to thank my graduate advisor Dr. Julie Hicks Patrick. Dr. Patrick’s consistent encouragement, feedback, and wisdom helped me complete both this milestone and the rest of my graduate program. I am also grateful to the other faculty in the psychology faculty for expanding my knowledge and perspective and for molding me into a better scholar than I was four years ago. I also want to thank Dr. Amy Overman, my undergraduate research mentor. She was the first to spark my love for research and continued to offer her excellent mentorship long after I was her official student.  My fellow graduate students, especially those in the lifespan developmental program, provided me with encouragement, support, and many laughs. I am specifically grateful for Anna Park and Amanda Chappell, who entered and completed the program at the same time as me and provided unmeasured support throughout the past four years. My parents Mark and Liz Bernstein along with my sister Monica believed in me in the most difficult moments of my graduate career and were always a safe spot for me to land. My grandparents, Mary and Charles Dobson, who both passed during my time in this program, always offered their unconditional love and support and their legacies motivated me to bring my best self to whatever I do.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals were first identified as populations at risk of health disparities in 2012 in the Healthy People 2020, an initiative by the Department of Health and Human Services. Those with minoritized sexual orientations (e.g., those who do not identify exclusively as heterosexual) experience challenges to their physical and emotional health across their lifespan (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013, 2017; Ward et al., 2015). Due to the historical context in which these adults have developed, the effects of such accumulative stress may result in negative physical and psychological health outcomes in middle-aged and older LGBTQ+ adults.   The field of lifespan developmental psychology states that development is both context-dependent and influenced by historical events throughout an individual’s life (Baltes et al., 1980). Given that development is a lifelong process, events that have occurred throughout the entirety of an individual’s life can influence a variety of their outcomes, including their physical and mental health. Therefore, considering how history-graded events (such as the AIDs epidemic or the 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States) influence the older LGBTQ+ community can provide additional insight into cohort differences.   The intersectional theoretical framework states that we must understand the combined impact of marginalized identities (Crenshaw, 1991). Thus, understanding the interaction between race and sexual orientation within a lifespan perspective  might provide additional insight into group-level differences. Racial health disparities are well documented with Black Americans HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      2    facing worse outcomes than White Americans (for reviews see Brondolo et al., 2009; Forde et al., 2019). Similar to sexual minority adults, those from marginalized racial groups might also experience accumulated health disparities later in life. Given that Black Americans are more likely to experience low socioeconomic status (SES; O’Rand, 2011), and the experiences of Black sexual minority adults are distinct from White sexual minority adults (Calabrese et al., 2015), understanding how these two marginalized identities interact with SES can highlight distinct interlocking experiences. A sharp focus on the developmental influences of marginalized individuals in terms of their health and well-being can provide additional insight.   Chapter 2: Literature Review  LGBT Historical Context   To fully understand the unique experiences of sexual minority adults, especially those in their later years of life, a brief historical background is helpful. The past century has seen a growing acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, but individuals living today have witnessed widespread criminalization of same sex attraction, behavior, and relationships. Up until 1961, same-sex sexual behavior, often considered an act of sodomy, was illegal in all 50 states of the U.S. (Kane, 2003). Additionally, homosexuality was included as a mental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM) up until 1973 (Silverstein, 2009). Older LGBTQ+ adults were alive for the Stonewall Riots in June of 1969. These riots, which were led by Black transgender women fought back against the police raids of the Stonewall Inn, a bar that welcomed many sexual minority patrons, These riots sparked a movement aimed at expanding rights for the LGBTQ+ community (Morris, 2009).  The epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is another defining historical event that shaped the current experiences of older LGBTQ+ adults. In the 1980s AIDS HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      3    was spreading rapidly among gay and bisexual men and was deadly for many. Though heterosexual folks were able to contract the disease, the stigma of AIDs being a “gay” disease led to apathy among many and a right-wing belief that those who contracted it were being punished by God (CDC, 2021; Morris, 2009). This apathy and general homophobia are thought to contribute to a lack of urgency to find a cure or treatment for the deadly disease (Halkitis, 2012).    Mass shootings targeting gay clubs demonstrate the extremist-level hate some still harbor towards the LGBTQ+ community. The 2016 Pulse night club mass shooting in Orlando and the recent November 2022 Colorado Springs gay club shooting are two examples of the hate this community still faces. Additionally, at a legislative level many states such as Florida and Texas are attempting to pass bills that would restrict the rights of sexual minority and transgender students. While older LGBTQ+ adults are still exposed to hate and intolerance, they have also seen a growth in the acceptance of their communities throughout the lifetime.   The United States achieved federal-level same-sex marriage equality in June of 2015. The Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Many older LGBTQ+ adults who had committed partnerships were finally able to marry their partners and have the same legal and financial benefits of married heterosexual couples (Morris, 2009). Additionally, public attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community have evolved over the past 50 plus years. Since 1973, the percentage of Americans reporting that “homosexual relations” are not wrong grew from 10 percent to 50 percent of respondents reporting that “homosexual relations” are never wrong in 2017 (Adamczyk & Liao, 2019). Similarly, data from Gallup and Newsweek’s Princeton Survey show that the percent of respondents supporting “homosexuals” getting hired for elementary teaching positions increased from 42 percent to 70 HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      4    percent from 1989 to 2007 (Adamczyk & Liao, 2019). This increasing acceptance is also seen in other countries. Of 52 countries polled, 67 percent showed an increasing proportion of citizens indicating that homosexuality is always justified from 1981 to 2008 (Smith et al., 2014).  This growing acceptance can be attributed to a variety of changes such as media exposure increasing liberal attitudes in Americans over the past 30 years (Garretson, 2015) or increased exposure to friends and family members identifying as LGBTQ+ (Becker, 2012). For a review of how public opinion about the LGBTQ+ community has changed see Adamczyk & Liao, 2019. Given the distinct historical and societal context in which they have developed, examining their unique health disparities might highlight age-based disparities within the community.  Minority Stress Model  The minority stress model was inspired by general stress theory, which states that experiences of adversity and stress can lead to harmful psychological outcomes (Dohrenwend, 2000). Early versions of the minority stress model stated that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals experience more threats to their emotional well-being than their heterosexual peers due to the stress that stems from stigma, discrimination, and prejudice (Meyer, 2003). Such stressors can be classified as either proximal or distal and they tend to accumulate to a degree significantly higher than the stressors heterosexual individuals face. Proximal stressors are those such as interpersonal harassment or discrimination, whereas distal stressors reflect more structural challenges, such as access to societal resources such as housing, marriage, and reproductive care (Meyer & Frost, 2013). These stressors put these individuals at an increased risk of poor physical and mental health outcomes.  More recently, this model expanded to include a focus on physical health, composed of mental and physical disorders, chronic health conditions, and well-being, among those HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      5    identifying as sexual minorities (Meyer & Frost, 2013). This expansion is appropriate, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stated that sexual orientation-based health disparities are some of the most pronounced (CDC, 2011). Multiple studies have found that sexual minority adults fare worse than their heterosexual counterparts on mental and physical health outcomes (Blosnich et al., 2014; Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013, 2017a; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017; Ward et al., 2015).  Some work examining health disparities has grouped individuals together such that they examined how sexual minority individuals of all genders compare to their heterosexual counterparts. For example, gay and lesbian adults are more likely than bisexual adults to report a cancer diagnosis and more likely than heterosexual adults to report arthritis and hepatitis (Ward et al., 2015). Bisexual adults are more likely to suffer from chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease (COPD) than gay or lesbian adults, who are at a higher risk than heterosexual adults (Ward et al., 2015). Lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults are more likely to report a disability than heterosexual adults and the mean age of those who report a disability is younger in sexual minority adults compared to their heterosexual counterparts (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013).  While some work has examined sexual minority adults as a homogenous group, research that disentangles the impact of gender and specific sexual orientation highlights some distinct disparities. Gay and bisexual men report higher levels of severe psychological distress, heavy drinking, moderate to heavy smoking, mental distress, life dissatisfaction, and activity limitations than heterosexual men (Blosnich et al., 2014; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017). Both lesbian and bisexual women are more likely to report psychological distress, multiple chronic conditions, an asthma diagnosis, and heavy drinking and smoking compared to heterosexual women (Blosnich et al., 2014; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017).  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      6    There are some distinct health disparities in lesbian and bisexual women samples. Lesbians are more likely to report poor or fair health than heterosexual women (Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017) while bisexual women are more likely than heterosexual women to report activity limitations (Blosnich et al., 2014). Research also suggests that bisexual women experience increased disparities in social and economic determinants of health, as compared to both lesbian and heterosexual women (Schuler et al., 2021).   Sexual minority adults in mid- and late-life are an historically understudied sample. Given the increasing societal acceptance of the LGBTQ+ communities over the past 50 years, LGB adults in mid- and late- life likely have had unique experiences related to minority stress. Given the trajectory of acceptance across their lifespan, some have been interested in studying health outcomes specifically within this group. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults at midlife, aged 50 – 70 years, report more mental distress, physical limitations, and worse general health (Wallace et al., 2011).  Some work has examined these disparities using the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national dataset from the CDC. Lesbian and bisexual women over the age of 50 are more likely to experience disability, mental distress, depression, arthritis, and obesity than heterosexual women (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017). Sexual minority women between the ages of 65 and 69 are more likely than heterosexual women of the same age to experience activity limitations, have difficulty walking or using the stairs, and having difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Sexual minority women in their 70s were more likely to face cognitive limitations and require assistance with IADLs than heterosexual women of the same age (Seelman, 2019). Gay and bisexual men over the age of 50 are more likely to experience disability, frequent mental distress, HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      7    and depression than heterosexual men (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017).  To understand the cumulative impact of sexual minority status on health outcomes, other work has started to examine the impact of age on these disparities. There is evidence that sexual orientation health disparities tend to decrease with age, with larger disparities in self-rated health and chronic conditions during adolescence and emerging adulthood and the smallest disparities present in older adulthood (Bränström et al., 2016). This pattern of resilience is also true for substance use such that disparities between gay/lesbian adults and heterosexual adults are only present in ages 18-25, though disparities persist into later adulthood for bisexual adults (Schuler et al., 2018). However, given that this data is cross-sectional, it may be reflecting cohort, rather than age-level differences.  Longitudinal data suggest that the passage of time might also influence this resilience. Over the course of 19 years, LGB adults show less of an increase in number of chronic conditions over time as compared to heterosexual adults (Nelson & Andel, 2020a).  This suggests that as LGB adults age, they become more resilient to the stress associated with their minority status. Infurna (2021) argues that the tenets of lifespan developmental psychology can inform our understanding of resilience in adulthood. Given that development is a lifelong process and is multidirectional in nature (Baltes, 1987), and that adults can display resilience in the face of chronic stress (i.e. minority stress; Jayawickreme et al., 2021), it is possible that sexual minority adults have developed strategies to cope with stress and adversity related to their identity (Infurna, 2021).  While the findings from Nelson and Andel’s (2020b) work could suggest that sexual minority adults are becoming more resilient with age, using chronic conditions as an outcome HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      8    variable presents some challenges. It could also be the case that sexual minority adults are developing chronic conditions at an earlier age than their heterosexual peers. In this case, they are not increasing in their number of conditions over time, because they already have been diagnosed with these conditions. Therefore, there may be a ceiling effect within this data that suggests older sexual minority adults are living with these conditions for a longer period of their lifespan, which likely has a negative impact on their overall health. Using a measure of health that displays more variability over time and might not have the same ceiling as number of conditions, such as self-rated health, might provide more insight into possible resilience. Self-rated health has been shown to predict mortality and this predictive validity has improved over time (Schnittker & Bacak, 2014). Other work examining health disparities in sexual minority adults has utilized this outcome measure.  In a study that utilized overall and propensity-matched sampling, LGB adults over the age of 50 reported significantly higher self-rated health than their heterosexual counterparts (Nelson & Andel, 2020b). The authors note that this finding is conflicting with previous studies that found worse self-rated health in this population, compared to heterosexual adults (i.e. Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2017a; Wallace et al., 2011). They note that it may their use of matched sampling, which subsequently led to a smaller sample size than is typical of using national datasets (n = 560). However, studies that do not utilize propensity score matching may not account for other differences between heterosexual and sexual minority adults over 50 that may lead to differences in self-rated health (Nelson & Andel, 2020b). Such confounds (such as sex, education, and race) might explain some differences between heterosexual and sexual minority adults. Therefore, matching individuals on those variables could help to control for some of that variability.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      9    More work is needed to examine how sexual orientation influences self-rated health and other health outcomes in a sample over the age of 50. Given the influence of socioeconomic resources on health and well-being, variables such as income and education might explain some of the variability in these health outcomes in minoritized adults. While some studies have controlled for education or income (e.g., Nelson & Andel, 2020b), other work has examined the specific influence of SES and how it might interact with minority status to impact health outcomes.  The research summarized thus far has related to sexual minority individuals. Transgender individuals are also a part of the LGBTQ+ community, however their experiences as gender minorities are distinct from those of sexual minorities. Given these unique experiences (e.g. concerns about medically transitioning, use of public bathrooms, participation in gendered sports) the stressors experienced by each group likely are distinct as well. The stigma and discrimination that transgender individuals face is pervasive and has been shown to negatively impact their health (Drabish & Theeke, 2022). For example, transgender individuals are more likely to delay getting medical care and experience discrimination from disclosing their identity compared to bisexual and gay or lesbian individuals (Macapagal et al., 2016). While these processes deserve their own line of research, issues related to transgender minority stress are outside the scope of the present study. Rather than extrapolate theories and findings based related to sexual minorities to gender minorities, the present study only focuses on those identifying as sexual minorities (gay, lesbian, bisexual, or ‘other’).  Racial & Socioeconomic Health Disparities    There is a well-established association between socioeconomic resources and health (for a review see Moor et al., 2017). Resources such as educational attainment, income, and HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      10    accumulated wealth all predict more favorable health outcomes. The socioeconomic status (SES)-health gradient posits that at all levels of SES, fewer socioeconomic resources are associated with worse physical health (Glymour et al., 2009). Many initial studies informing the SES-health gradient used mortality as the main outcome variable, with findings suggesting employment status and education predict mortality (Kitagawa & Hauser, 1973). Research examining the influence of SES on health evolved to include self-rated health (Kraus et al., 2013; Moor et al., 2017), inflammation leading to chronic illness (Miller et al., 2009), and biomarkers (Matthews & Gallo, 2011) as outcomes.  SES is often operationalized as either education, income, or wealth (Shuey & Willson, 2008). Education tends to predict later markers of SES and can be useful in assessing SES in those not currently in the workforce (Matthews & Gallo, 2011). Health psychologists have worked to understand the psychosocial mechanisms that might explain the association between SES and health. Matthews and Gallo (2011) theorize that stress and psychological distress, negative emotions, availability of psychosocial resources, and enactment of health behaviors all might explain this association.   The cumulative disadvantage framework is a lifespan developmental approach that seeks to explain how the association between SES and health evolves over the lifespan. Cumulative disadvantage is based on the notion that as individuals progress throughout their lifespan, disadvantages present in early life will accumulate, leading to increased disparities in a variety of outcomes later in life (Dannefer, 2020). Cumulative disadvantage, along with life course epidemiology explain that socioeconomic disadvantages early in life set individuals up for a trajectory of poor health outcomes throughout their life (Fuller-Iglesias et al., 2010; Seabrook & Avison, 2012). There is evidence of early life SES predicting physical health in adulthood, even HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      11    when controlling for SES in adulthood (Conroy et al., 2010; Poulton et al., 2002).  The weathering hypothesis, which is informed by the cumulative disadvantage framework (Geronimus, 1992, 2013) seeks to explain how racial health disparities accumulate with age. This hypothesis states that disadvantages related to social and economic resources may explain racial health disparities due in part to individuals experiencing premature aging (Forde et al., 2019).   Black Americans are more likely to face early life adversity which manifest in educational disparities between them and White Americans. These disparities accumulate over the lifetime, leading to a gap in income, wealth, and other socioeconomic resources between White and Black Americans (O’Rand, 2011). Inequities in socioeconomic resources account for some of the health disparities between Black and White Americans. Black Americans suffer from higher rates of maternal (Leonard et al., 2019) and infant mortality (The Office of Minority Health, 2020), worse self-rated health, and higher incidence rates of chronic illness (Williams et al., 2010). However, some researchers suggest that these racial health disparities are due to factors beyond SES. Even when controlling for education, self-rated health is worse in Black Americans compared to White Americans. Additionally, as White people age, the benefit education has on their self-rated health increases at a higher rate than it does for Black people (Shuey & Wilson, 2008). These findings suggest that adversities related to being a part of a racial minority group contribute to the cumulative effect of SES on health throughout the lifespan (Ferraro et al., 2017).   It is likely that experiences related to chronic discrimination are influencing these health disparities, above and beyond the impact of SES factors (Gillispie-Bell, 2021).  This discrimination often manifests itself in health care and other clinical settings. Health care professionals can carry implicit biases that cause them to treat racial minority patients differently HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      12    than White patients (Hall et al., 2015) This might look like downplaying Black patients’ experiences of pain and subsequently offering less assistance to treat this pain (Hoffman et al., 2016). Additionally, the chronic experience of discrimination including overt experiences such as blatant racism along with microaggressions might place Black individuals under increased stress (Bailey et al., 2017).  Gillispie-Bell (2021) argues that systems related to structural racism are also responsible for these disparities. Housing segregation, though made illegal in 1968, continues to lead to racially segregated neighborhoods today. Neighborhoods where a majority of residents are not White are more likely to have tobacco ads and higher rates of crime (Bailey et al., 2017;Widome et al., 2013). Additionally, these neighborhoods are more likely to be in areas where access to nutritious and affordable food is inaccessible and spaces for recreation and physical activity are limited (Lovasi et al., 2009).   While health disparities between Black and White individuals have been well explored, there is evidence of a so-called “Hispanic Paradox”. This suggests that despite exposure to stressors related to racial minority status, Hispanic individuals display more positive health outcomes than their non-Hispanic counterparts (et al., 2007). Hispanic Americans have been found to have better mental health outcomes, lower rates of chronic disease, and lower mortality rates than non-Hispanic Americans (Ruiz et al., 2016). However, there is evidence that the longer Hispanic immigrants remain in the United States, their advantage over White non-Hispanic Americans becomes less substantial (Hamilton et al., 2015). This suggests that as Hispanic immigrants acculturate to the norms of the United States, they might adopt more harmful health behaviors and experience the negative impacts of being in a minoritized group (Lara et al., 2005; Ferraro et al., 2017).  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      13    Minorities’ Diminished Returns (MDR) Theory  One potential explanation for mixed findings regarding self-rated health disparities in middle-aged and older LGB adults is the minorities diminished returns (MDR) theory. The MDR theory states that socioeconomic status (SES) itself does not explain all health disparities across social groups, but rather those in minority groups experience less benefits from SES resources (such as income or education) than the general population (Assari, 2018). As a result, these disparities tend to increase at higher levels of education (Assari et al., 2019). Most of the work supporting MDR theory has examined these disparities in racial and ethnic minoritized adults.   While higher educational attainment is linked to better self-rated health, Black individuals tend to benefit less from this education than White individuals (Assari, 2018). Additionally, education is less protective against physical disability for Hispanic adults than non-Hispanic adults (Assari & Bazargan, 2019). Limited work has examined how MDR theory manifests in sexual minority adults. There is evidence that education and sexual orientation status interact in such a way that high educational attainment is less beneficial for LGB adults compared to heterosexual adults in terms of obesity, self-rated health, and well-being (Assari, 2019; Assari & Bazargan, 2019).   The MDR theory is relatively novel in examining how individuals of minority status are differentially impacted by education. Therefore, to our knowledge, no study has examined how individuals with multiple minoritized statuses are impacted by educational attainment. Specifically, we are interested in examining how the combination of a racial and sexual orientation minority status interact with education to influence health outcomes.   HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      14    Intersectionality   The term intersectionality was first used to describe how mainstream feminism tends to exclude the experiences of Black women (Crenshaw, 1991). Intersectionality, often referred to as a theoretical framework rather than a theory (Bowleg, 2012), posits that individuals exist at the intersection of their social identities (race, sexual orientation, SES, gender) and their experiences are dependent upon the unique combination of privilege (or lack thereof) those identities afford them. Intersectionality focuses on the intersecting identities of those from historically oppressed groups. This includes those from racial or ethnic minority groups, individuals identifying as a part of the LBGTQ+ population, and those from low-SES background. Those who take an intersectional approach do not examine how distinct identities independently influence outcomes (such as health) but rather how the combination of these identities leads to distinct outcomes (Bowleg, 2012; Crenshaw, 1991).  Nash (2008) highlights the lack of consistent methodology used to study intersectionality, rationalizing this with the point that it is difficult to capture the complexity of intersectional, marginalized experiences. It is not enough to simply categorize individuals, but rather researchers must question why these categories lead to disparate outcomes and how these individuals’ lived experiences inform group-level differences (McCall, 2005; Nash, 2008). Moradi and Grzanka (2017) note that social science researchers who take an intersectional lens will inevitably cloud the viewpoints of those marginalized individuals. The power and privilege that some researchers hold and a lack of lived experiences in congruency with those they seek to study will likely impact the way in which they interpret data. This should be considered when interpreting results of intersectional research (Haraway, 1988; Moradi & Grzanka, 2017).  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      15    Qualitative work has found that White sexual minority individuals tend to hold their sexual orientation as more central to their identity while sexual minority Black and/or Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) consider their intersectional identities (i.e. both race and sexual orientation; Hagai et al., 2020). This suggests that only accounting for how sexual orientation impacts physical and mental health outcomes likely is not capturing the full image of identity-based health disparities.   This intersectional framework has evolved over the past 10-15 years to account for health disparities in marginalized groups. Bowleg (2012) explained that intersectionality can inform public health practices by focusing on how individuals’ multiple, intersecting identities combine to produce unique health outcomes. To account for the health disparities experienced by a Black queer woman, for example, one cannot combine their knowledge of racial, gender, and sexual orientation-based disparities to account for this woman’s experience. But rather the intersection at which this woman exists is unique and her health outcomes will reflect that. For example, race, SES, and gender interact such that Black women who are highly educated are still more likely to experience infant mortality than non-Latino White women of lower educational attainment (Jackson & Williams, 2006). Additionally, Black sexual minority women are more likely to experience poor psychological and social well-being along with depressive symptoms than both White sexual minority women and Black sexual minority men (Calabrese et al., 2015).   Brown and colleagues (2016) were interested in testing the intersectionality theoretical framework as it applies to the impact of race, gender, and SES on self-rated health. They explored whether these identity-based variables combined in an additive or multiplicative fashion to influence health outcomes. Specifically, they were interested in whether race, gender, and SES individually led to increased health disparities (additive) or whether these variables HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      16    showed significant interactions in their influence on health (multiplicative). They found significant interactions among race, gender, and SES. Education was less beneficial for Black and Mexican American individuals than it was for White individuals, which is consistent with both the Intersectionality theoretical framework and the minority diminished returns theory. Additionally, they found a three-way interaction between race, gender, and education such that Black and Mexican American women with low levels of education had the worst health.   Work that expands on intersectionality might examine how sexual minority status interacts with race and SES to influence health. The minority stress model and the minority diminished returns (MDR) theory states that sexual minority individuals experience worse health outcomes and benefit less from educational attainment than heterosexual adults. An intersectional approach might assess how those findings interact with race to understand the combined impact of marginalized identities. The present study sought to expand upon the work of Brown and colleagues by applying both an intersectional approach to the minority stress model and the minority diminished returns theory. I was interested in whether age and sexual orientation interacted with race and SES in an additive or multiplicative fashion to influence health outcomes.  Present Study   Researchers have started to examine the ways in which older LGBTQ+ individuals experience both physical and mental health. Given that this is a historically understudied sample with unique societal experiences (i.e. the AIDS epidemic, the Stonewall riots, and the legalization of gay marriage) research with this population can highlight how cultural context influence health and well-being. There is mixed evidence for health disparities in older sexual minority samples with some work finding that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults over the HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      17    age of 50 fare worse than their heterosexual counterparts in domains of mental and physical health (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017). However, some work utilizing propensity score matching found that sexual minority adults over the age of 50 have higher levels of self-reported health than heterosexual adults of the same age (Nelson & Andel, 2020b).   When direct age comparisons have been made, some work suggests that health disparities related to sexual orientation narrow or even disappear in older adults (Bränström et al., 2016; Schuler et al., 2018). Longitudinal data has found that LGB adults show less of an increase in chronic health conditions than heterosexual adults (Nelson & Andel, 2020a) over time. However, this question has not been asked in a large, nationally representative dataset and research with older sexual minorities is limited. Therefore, the present study was first interested in whether age exacerbates or dampens health disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual adults using a nationally representative health dataset, the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS). The minority stress model states that sexual minority adults experience worse health and the cumulative disadvantage theory states that these disparities will accumulative over time. These two theories suggest that age will exacerbate sexual orientation related health disparities. However, given that previous longitudinal work has found the opposite (Nelson & Andel, 2020a) I was interested in whether older sexual minority individuals display resilience or experience accumulated health disparities compared to their younger counterparts.   Additionally, as informed by the intersectionality theoretical framework (Crenshaw, 1991), one cannot study individual minoritized statuses without accounting for other equally impactful identities. Therefore, the present study was also interested in how age, race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status (SES) interact to influence physical and mental health HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      18    outcomes. The minorities diminished returns (MDR) theory states that for individuals of marginalized identities, education (a key socioeconomic resource) is going to have less of a positive impact on their physical and mental health (Assari, 2018). This is the case for historically oppressed racial groups along with sexual minority individuals. However, to my knowledge, no work has applied a MDR approach to assess how socioeconomic resources impact the health for those with a combination of multiple marginalized identities.   Inspired by the work of Brown and colleagues (2016) the present study sought to understand whether the effects of race, sexual orientation, age, and SES on health were additive or multiplicative. Their findings suggest that the effects of race, gender, and education are interactive in their impact on self-rated health, which supports the intersectionality theoretical framework (Brown et al., 2016). The present study expanded upon the work of Brown and colleagues by applying both an intersectional and cumulative disadvantage approach to the minority stress model. They found that race, gender, and SES interacted to influence health. I was interested in examining whether sexual minority status also interacts with age, race, and SES in a way that shows distinct health outcomes in those with multiple marginalized identities or multiplicative fashion to influence health outcomes. Specifically, this study was interested in self-reported physical and mental health. There is evidence that higher levels of mental health predict more favorable health behaviors, which is predictive of higher levels of physical health (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2017b). Therefore, in the present study physical and mental health should show similar enough patterns to comprise a latent variable of overall health.  Research Questions and Hypotheses  Research Question 1. Does age dampen or exacerbate health disparities related to sexual orientation? See Figure 1 for conceptual model.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      19    1) Given that those identifying as sexual minorities tend to experience a variety of health disparities when compared to heterosexual adults (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013, 2017a; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017), I predicted that those identifying as lesbian/gay, bisexual, or other would have worse health those who do not have those identities.  2) Cumulative disadvantage framework suggests that health disparities related to sexual orientation would increase with age (Dannefer, 2020), but previous work examining older sexual minority folks has found the opposite to be true (Bränström et al., 2016; Nelson & Andel, 2020a). Given that studies examining older sexual minorities with nationally representative data are limited (Flatt et al., 2022), I opted to expand this literature. Based on previous findings, I predicted that the health disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexual individuals would be less distinct in older adults compared to younger adults.  Research Question 2. How does the combination of age, race, and sexual orientation influence the association between education and health? See Figure 2 for conceptual model.  3) Black sexual minority individuals tend to fare worse than White sexual minority individuals (Calabrese et al., 2015), and both race and sexual minority status dampen the benefit of education on health (Assari, 2018, 2019; Assari & Bazargan, 2019). An intersectional framework supports the notion that the combination of these marginalized identities will have distinct impacts on health (Crenshaw, 1991; Bowleg, 2012). Therefore, I predicted that age, race, sexual orientation, and education would interact in such a way that those who HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      20    are Black, not heterosexual, younger, and with low educational attainment would have the worst self-rated healthHEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      21    Chapter 3: Methods Procedure  Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (BRFSS) data were already collected via telephone by the CDC. Data is collected in all 50 states and those with both landline and cellular telephone were included. For landline interviews, interviewers collected data from a randomly selected adult from each household. For cellular telephone interviews, interviewers collect data from whoever answers the phone. Each state administered a core component that inquiries about health conditions, perceptions, and behaviors. There are optional BRFSS modules that states can opt into (the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity module, for example) and there are state-added questions that individual states can develop and add based on individual need. The core module took an average of 17 minutes to complete. Optional modules and state-added questions took an additional 5 to 10 minutes to complete (CDC, 2022).  Participants  Data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used. The BRFSS is a telephone survey collected throughout the United States and includes both required and optional modules. The sexual orientation and gender identity module is optional and was collected in 34 of the 50 U.S. states. These states include: Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      22     The unmatched sample (all participants) in the present study included a total of 167,508 individuals. These participants ranged in age from 18 to 80 with a mean age of 54.4 years (SD = 17.0). Most (94 percent) of the sample identified as heterosexual while 2 percent identified as gay or lesbian, 2.8 percent identified as bisexual, and 1.3 percent identified as “other”, but not heterosexual. Most of the sample (84.3) was White, 7.2 percent were Black, and 8.5 percent were Hispanic. Less than half of the sample (42.9 percent) indicated they graduated from college or technical school, 28.1 percent attended some college or technical school, 24.2 percent graduated high school but did not attend college or technical school, and 4.8 percent did not graduate high school. Full demographic information can be found in Table 1 and information about participants’ ages can be found in Table 2.  Propensity Score Matching. The propensity score matching add-on in SPSS version 28.0 (Thoemmes, 2012) was used to create a matched score with a 1:1 sexual minority to heterosexual sample. Propensity score matching helps account for confounds that might naturally vary between heterosexual and sexual minority folks above and beyond simply controlling for these variables. This better allows conclusions to be made that it is sexual minority status that is contributing to health disparities, above and beyond contextual factors (Nelson & Andel, 2020b). This add on uses a logistic regression to examine individuals’ odds of being a sexual minority participant (gay or lesbian, bisexual, or other; Nelson & Andel, 2020b). This results in a propensity score for each participant based on their likelihood to be in the sexual minority group. Each participant was matched based on this propensity score and on the covariates of age, sex, race, and education. To ensure the sexual minority and non-sexual minority groups in the matched sample were as closely matched on our covariates as possible a criteria of 0 was used. HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      23    This yielded 10,126 exact matches (20,252 participants total). Seven sexual minority participants were not able to be matched based on the covariates of interest, so they were excluded from the final matched sample. To confirm that the sexual minority and non-sexual minority participants did not significantly differ on covariates, both chi-square tests of independence and independent samples t-tests were conducted to compare group differences. In the matched sample, the sexual minority and non-sexual minority participants did not differ significantly in terms of sex (c2 (1) = .001, p = .979), race, (c2 (2) = .006, p = .997), education (c2 (3) = .003, p = .998), or age (t (20257) = .061, p = .983). This confirmed that the matching process was successful.  The matched sample had an average age of 43.7 years (SD = 18.0) with an age range of 18-80. More than half of the matched sample (59.3 percent) identified as female. Half of the sample (50 percent) identified as heterosexual, 16.4 percent identifies as gay or lesbian, 23.2 percent identifies as bisexual, and 10.4 percent identifies as “other” but not heterosexual. Most of the sample (80.2 percent) is White, 6.9 percent of the sample is Black, and 12.9 percent of the sample is Hispanic. Less than half (43.1 percent) of the sample graduated college or technical school, 29.6 percent attended some college or technical school, 22.2 percent graduated high school, and 5.1 percent did not graduate high school. Full demographic information can be found in Table 1 and information about participants’ ages can be found in Table 2. Measures     Sexual Orientation. If participants indicated they identified as male, they were asked “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself” with “gay”, “straight, that is not gay”, “bisexual”, or “something else” as response options. If participants identified as female, they were asked “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself” with HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      24    “gay or lesbian” , “straight, that is not gay”, “bisexual”, or “something else” as the response options. These sex-based variables were recoded into a single sexual orientation variable that combined participants such that the response options were: gay or lesbian, bisexual, other not heterosexual, and heterosexual. A dummy-coded variable for each of the four sexual orientations was created. Gay/lesbian, bisexual, other, and heterosexual are dichotomous variables with a yes or no option.   Race. A calculated race variable was used that separated participants into three groups based on how they identify. These groups included “White”, “Black or African American”, and “Hispanic”.    Age. A calculated age variable was used that separated participants into younger (18-49) and older (50+) adults.   Education. A calculated education variable was included in the BRFSS data that separated participants into four groups. These groups included “did not graduate high school”, “graduated high school” , “attended college or technical school” and “graduated from college or technical school.” Given that over 45 percent of participants in the sample graduated college or technical school, I opted to create a dichotomized education variable to include in analyses. This variable included the two categories of: graduated college or technical school and did not graduate college or technical school.  Overall Health. A latent construct assessing overall health included self-reported general health, number of poor physical health days, and number of poor mental health days. General health was assessed by asking participants “Would you say that your general health is” on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being excellent and 5 being poor. The unmatched sample had a mean general health score of 2.49 (SD = 1.04) and the matched sample had a mean score of 2.49 (SD = 1.04). HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      25    See Table 3 for the frequency distribution of the general health variable for both the matched and unmatched samples. Poor physical health days was assessed by asking participants “Thinking about your physical health, which includes physical illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was your physical health not good?”  The unmatched sample had a mean score of 3.80 days (SD = 8.30) and the matched sample had a mean score of 3.95 (SD = 17.96). Poor mental health days was assessed by asking participants “Thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” The unmatched sample had a mean score of 4.23 days (SD = 8.16) while the matched sample had a mean score of 6.68 days (SD = 9.50). See Table 4 for mean, standard deviations, and ranges of the three outcome variables.  Analytic Strategy   The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 28.0 (SPSS; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used to recode and clean the data along with conducting univariate (outliers, skewness, kurtosis, missingness) and multivariate (outliers, homogeneity of variances) data checks. Analysis of a Moment Structures version 28.0.0 (AMOS; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used to analyze all measurement and structural equation models (SEM) for the first research question. The measurement model assessed fit of the proposed latent variable, overall health. Structural equation models were used to account for measurement error in the latent health variable and test the individual regression paths within the model. Chi-square values tend to be inflated by large sample sizes (Little, 2013), so other indices of model fit were used. Specifically, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI; values > .95 indicates good fit) the Tucker- Lewis Index (TLI; values > .95 indicates good fit), and root mean square approximation (RMSEA; <.08 indicates HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      26    acceptable fit, while < .5 indicates acceptable fit) were used. Individual regression paths were assessed with unstandardized beta weights, standard error, p-values and critical ratios. P-values less than .05 indicate significant associations while critical ratios greater than the absolute value of 1.96 indicate significant associations. The critical ratios provide a standardized estimate of the significance of a regression path by dividing the unstandardized beta weight by its standard error.    To assess age group differences, a multigroup analysis was used. Previous work examining older LGBTQ+ adults have considered those over the age of 50 older adults (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013). Thus, participant age groups included younger (18-49) and older (50+) adults. The multi-group analysis examined how well the model fit across age groups and whether associations differ between age groups. Critical ratios examining the differences between regression paths between the two groups were examined. Critical ratios greater than the absolute value of 1.96 indicate a significant difference between groups.  The measurement and structural equation models were tested in both the matched and unmatched samples. The propensity score matching attempted to reduce the influence of demographic variables that naturally varied between sexual minority and heterosexual participants. The use of the matched sample in the structural equation model can better conclude as to whether it is sexual orientation itself that is influencing health, rather than extraneous variables that might vary between groups.   SPSS was also used to run a 4 x 3 x 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). This was done to test whether there were significant group-level differences in the three health outcome variables based on sexual orientation, race, age, and education. Wilk’s lambda was calculated, which is an estimate of the variation in the three outcome variables that is not explained in the predictor variables. P-values less than .05 indicate significant main effects and HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      27    interactions. Partial eta squared was calculated as a measure of effect size. Main effects of individual predictor variables and 2-, 3-, and 4-way interactions were calculated. Significant interactions were probed by examining whether these were significant univariate interactions on single outcome variables. Additionally, mean level outcome variables were plotted for any significant interactions. These are represented visually with bar charts. Because the present study was interested in how demographic variables interacted with sexual orientation the MANOVA was only run in the unmatched sample. This was a sample where heterosexual and sexual minority participants were not matched based on covariates.  Data Cleaning  Missingness. Participants who provided data on the predictor variables of interest (race, sexual orientation, age, education, and income) were included in the sample. This yielded a sample size of 172,201 individuals. The percent of that sample that had missing data in the three outcome variables: general health, number of poor physical health days, and number of poor mental health days. For general health, 0.2% of the sample had missing data. 1.6% of the sample had missing data for poor physical health days, while 1.3% of the sample was missing data for poor mental health days.  To assess whether the data for the outcome variables of interest (general health, number of poor physical health days, and number of poor mental health days) were missing completely at random we ran Little’s test of missing completely at random (MCAR; Little, 1988). Little’s MCAR test was significant (c2 (9) = 50212.98, p < .01), which indicates the data was not missing completely at random.  The large sample size is likely contributing to the chi-square value having a significance less than .05. Given the large sample size of the present study (N = 172, 201) and the fact that each outcome variable was missing less than two percent of data, HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      28    listwise deletion was used. Participants who did not provide data for all three outcome variables (general health, number of poor physical health days, and number of poor mental health days) were excluded. This yielded a final sample size of 167,508. This sample that excluded those with missing data was used to create the propensity score matched sample. The sample generated through propensity score matching had no missing data.  Though listwise deletion was used, to provide a better understanding of who was missing outcome data, I examined how missingness related to different demographic variables. To assess whether missingness on the outcome variables was associated with our demographic variables, I first calculated one missingness variable per outcome variable (general health, number of poor physical health days, and number of poor mental health days). For each missingness variables, if a participant was missing data, they were coded as 0 and if they provided data they were coded as 1.  To assess whether the categorical demographic variables (sex, income, education, sexual  orientation, and race) were associated with missingness on our outcome variables, a ran chi-square tests of independence was run. For number of poor physical health days, missingness was associated with sex of respondent (c2 (1) = 14.25, p < .01) such that 43.9 percent of those missing physical health data were male and 56.1% were female. Missingness for physical health was also associated with completed level of education (c2 (3) = 535.30, p < .01. Of those missing physical health data, 11.2 percent did not graduate high school, 34.6 percent graduated high school, 28.6 percent attended college or technical school, and 25.6 percent graduated college or technical school. Missingness for poor physical health was associated with race (c2 (2) = 46.36, p < .01). Of those missing physical health data, 79.7 percent were White, 10.0 percent were Black and 10.3 percent were Hispanic.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      29    Missingness for poor mental health days was associated with sex of respondent (c2 (1) = 5.60, p = .02). Of those missing mental health data (2,190), 44.9 percent identified as male and 55.1 percent identified as female. Missingness for poor mental health days was associated with education (c2(3) = 314.39, p < .01). Of those missing mental health data (2,190), 11.1 percent did not graduate high school, 31.2 percent graduated high school, 29.2 percent attended some college or technical school, and 28.5 percent graduated college or technical school. Missingness for poor mental health days was associated with race (c2 (2) = 24.66, p < .01. Of those missing poor mental health data (2,190), 80.8 percent were White, 9.8 percent were Black, and 9.5 percent were Hispanic.     To assess whether our continuous demographic variable (age) was associated with missingness on our outcome variables, I ran an independent samples t-tests to assess whether average age differed significantly between those who had missing outcome data and those who did not. For poor physical health days, the independent samples t-test was significant (t (172199) = 21.26, p = .004) such that mean age was higher for those who were missing physical health data (M = 61.37, SD = 16.86) than for those who were not missing physical health data (M = 54.4, SD = 17.0). For poor mental health days, the independent samples t-test was significant (t (172199) = 8.51, p = .02) such that the mean age for those who were missing mental health data (M = 57.6, SD = 17.62) was significantly higher than for those who were not missing mental health data (M= 54.5, SD = 17.0).   HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      30    Chapter 4: Results Unmatched Sample.  Univariate outliers.  To assess whether there were univariate outliers, z scores for both of continuous outcome variables (poor physical and mental health days) were calculated. The z-scores for poor physical health days ranged from -.46 to 3.14. The z-scores for poor mental health days ranged from -.52 to 3.15. None of these participants were outliers on the two continuous variables of interest.  Multivariate outliers. To identify multivariate outliers on the independent variables included in analyses (sexual orientation, age, race, and education) Mahalanobis distance scores for each participant were calculated. 4,023 participants’ Mahalanobis distance scores had a p value below .001, indicating a multivariate outlier. However, upon further inspection of these participants, 3,323 identified as gay or lesbian (the entire sample of gay and lesbian participants) and 700 identified as bisexual. Given that these individuals all identified as sexual minorities and comprised a large portion of our sexual minority sample, they were not excluded from the sample. Skewness and Kurtosis. To assess whether the two continuous outcome variables were skewed or kurtotic, skewness and kurtosis statistics and standard errors were calculated. For number of poor physical health days, the skewness statistic was 2.39 and the standard error of skewness was .006. The zskewness ,which is taken by dividing the skewness statistic by the standard error and taking the absolute value, was 397.83. This is greater than 3.2 and violates the skewness assumption. The kurtosis statistic was 4.387 and the standard error of kurtosis was .012, which makes the zkurtosis value 365.58, which is greater than the absolute value of 3.2. This suggests that this data is both skewed and kurtotic. The skewness statistic for number of poor HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      31    mental health days was 2.183 and the standard error of skewness was .006, which gives a zskewness of 363.8. The kurtosis statistic was 3.689 and the standard error of kurtosis was .012, which gives a zkurtosis of 307.42. Number of poor mental health days is also both skewed and kurtotic. Given that 64.9 percent of sample indicated they had zero poor physical health days and 59.9 percent of the sample indicated they had zero poor mental health days, using a log or square root transformation would significantly reduce the size of the present sample. It is mathematically impossible to take the log or square root of zero. These zero values have implications for the dependent variables (i.e. zero poor health days indicates excellent health), so they should not be excluded.  Therefore, a constant of 1 was added to both the poor physical health and poor mental health variables. Then a log and square root transformation was performed for each of these variables. However, even after transforming both variables, they still displayed a zskewness and zkurtosis greater than the absolute value of 3.2. Log transformed poor physical health days had a zskewness of 231.67 and a zkurtosis of 41.75. Square root transformed poor physical health days had a zskewness of 320.33 and a zkurtosis of 202.58. Log transformed poor mental health days had a zskewness of 177.33 and a zkurtosis of 202.58. Square root transformed poor mental health days had a zskewness of 269 and a zkurtosis of 118.67. Additionally, the structural equation model tested for research question one was run with both the log and square root transformed variables. Model fit was not significantly different, and the magnitude and direction of the regression weights were the same as the untransformed variables.  Since multiple indicators would be included in analyses, I was prepared to adjust the error terms in our structural equation model (SEM), if necessary. Additionally, SEM is robust to minor violations of normality (Arbuckle, 1996). Given that, both log and square root HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      32    transformations did not fix skewness or kurtosis in either variable, and the transformed variables did not lead to significant differences in the structural equation model of the present study, I opted to move forward with the non-transformed variables.  Homogeneity of Variance. To assess whether the three outcome variables had approximately equal variance across four independent variables (age, race, sexual orientation, and education), Levene’s tests of homogeneity of variances were conducted. For general health, homogeneity of variance was violated between age groups (p < .01), racial groups ( p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p = .011), and education groups (p < .01),  For number of poor physical health days, homogeneity of variances was violated between age groups (p < .01), racial groups (p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p < .01), and education groups (, p < .01).  For number of poor mental health days, homogeneity of variances was violated between age groups (p < .01), racial groups (p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p < .01), and education groups (p <.01). Given that the p-values of Levene’s test are more likely to be smaller (closer to significance) in larger sample sizes, the sample size of over 167,00 likely partially explains this violation. Therefore, I opted to proceed with the MANOVA analysis.  Matched Sample.  Univariate Outliers. In our matched sample of 20,252, the z-scores for poor physical health days ranged from -.49 to 3.21. The z-scores for poor mental health days ranged from -.70 to 2.45. None of the participants in the matched sample were outliers on the two continuous variables of interest.     Multivariate Outliers. Mahalanobis distance scores were also calculated for the matched sample to identify multivariate outliers on our four independent variables. Within this sample, HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      33    zero participants’ Mahalanobis distance scores were below .001, indicating that this sample did not have any multivariate outliers.  Skewness and Kurtosis. To assess whether the two continuous outcome variables were skewed or kurtotic, skewness and kurtosis statistics and standard errors were calculated. For number of poor physical health days, the skewness statistic was 2.37 and the standard error of skewness was .02. The zskewness was 118.5, which violates the skewness assumption. The kurtosis statistic was 4.44 and the standard error of kurtosis was .03, which makes the zkurtosis value 130.65, which is greater than the absolute value of 3.2. This suggests that this data is both skewed and kurtotic. The skewness statistic for number of poor mental health days was 1.43 and the standard error of skewness was .02, which gives a zskewness of 84.12. The kurtosis statistic was .78 and the standard error of kurtosis was .03, which gives a zkurtosis of 22.91. This suggests that poor mental health days is also skewed and kurtotic. Again, given that SEM is robust to violations of normality (Arbuckle, 1996) and the zero values in both continuous outcome variables are meaningful, I opted not to transform the data.  Homogeneity of Variance. Multiple Levene’s tests of homogeneity of variances were also conducted in the matched sample. For general health, homogeneity of variances was violated between age groups (p < .01), racial groups ( p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p < .01), and education groups (p < .01).  For number of poor physical health days, homogeneity of variances was violated between age groups (p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p < .01), and education groups (p < .01). However, homogeneity of variances was not violated between racial groups for number of poor physical health days ( p = .28).   For number of poor mental health days, homogeneity of variances was violated between age groups (p < .01), sexual orientation groups (p < .01), and education groups (p <.01). HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      34    However, homogeneity of variances was not violated between racial groups for number of poor mental health days (p = .28).  Given that the p-value of Levene’s test is more likely to be smaller (closer to significance) in larger sample sizes, the sample size of over 10,000 likely partially explains this violation. Therefore, I opted to proceed with the MANOVA analysis.  Preliminary Analyses  Unmatched Sample. To understand how the variables that comprised the latent variable of overall health (general health, poor physical health days, and poor mental health days) were associated with one another, I calculated Pearson’s R correlation coefficients. Given that the data violated some assumptions of normality, I also opted to calculate Spearman’s rho correlation coefficients. General health was significantly associated with both poor physical health days (r = .50, p < .001; r = .43, p < .001) and poor mental health days (r = .27, p < .01; r = .21, p < .001). Poor physical and poor mental days were significantly associated with one another (r = .31, p < .01; r = .30, p < .01).   Matched sample. I also calculated these correlation coefficients in the matched sample. General health was significantly associated with both poor physical health days (r = .50, p < .01; r = .43, p < .01) and poor mental health days (r = .29, p < .01; r = .25, p < .01). Poor physical and poor mental days were significantly associated with one another (r = .31, p < .01; r = .33,     p < .01).  Research Question 1: Model Testing   I first examined the measurement model for overall health. Factor loadings were examined for each of the three endogenous variables that comprised the latent variable. The regression path for the general health variable was set to 1.0. Physical health days had an HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      35    unstandardized regression weight of 9.222 (SE (b) = .079 p < .01, C.R. = 116.17). Poor mental health days had an unstandardized regression weight of 4.799 (SE (b) = .039, p < .001, C.R. = 122.55).   The multi-group model depicted in Figure 1 was run. The model (c2 (32) = 12537.15, p < .01) had a good fit (CFI = .853, TLI = .744, RMSEA = .048). Using the modification indices, a covariance between race and education was added. This slightly improved model fit, (CFI = .882, TLI = .781, RMSEA = .045). For younger adults, the model accounted for 3.7 percent of the variance in overall health. For younger adults, gay or lesbian identity (b = .129, SE(b) = .019, p <.01, CR = 6.85, bisexual identity (b = .418, SE (b) = .013, p <.01, CR = 31.28), and other identity (b = .470, SE(b) = .023,  p < .01, CR = 20.31) were associated with overall health. Education was significantly associated with gay/lesbian identity (b = .005, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = 3.51),  bisexual identity (b = -.014, SE (b) = .002, p <.01, CR = -7.61), and other identity (b = -.004, SE (b) = .001, p <.001, CR = -3.30). Race was also significantly associated with gay/lesbian identity  (b = .005, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = 6.06), bisexual identity(b = -.006, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = -4.69),  and other identity (b = .005, SE (b) = .001, p <.001, CR = 6.65). See Table 11 for regression weights and associated statistics for younger adults. See Figure 3 for the structural equation model.  For older adults, gay or lesbian identity was significantly associated with overall health at the p <.05 level (b = .045, SE (b) = .025, p = .03, CR = 2.18). Bisexual identity (b = .180, SE (b) = .025, p < .01, CR = 7.14) and other identity (b = .222, SE (b) = .026, p < .01, CR = 8.37) were significantly associated with overall health at the p < .01 level. Education was significantly associated with gay/lesbian identity (b = .009, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = 11.78),  bisexual HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      36    identity (b = .003, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = 4.23), and other identity (b = -.004, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = -6.09). Race was not significantly associated with gay/lesbian identity  (b = .001, SE (b) = .001, p = .36, CR = .92) or bisexual identity (b = .001, SE (b) = .001, p = .10,              CR = 1.64). Race was associated with other identity (b = .004, SE (b) = .001, p <.01, CR = 6.65). See Table 12 for regression weights and associated statistics for older adults. See Figure 4 for the structural equation model.  Both the unstandardized and standardized beta weights for the association between sexual orientation and health were larger in younger adults than older adults. To test whether these differences were significant, critical ratios examining the differences between the groups in the multigroup analysis were examined. Critical ratios greater than the absolute value of 1.96 indicate that association between a sexual orientation variable and the overall health variable significantly differed from one another. The association between gay/lesbian identity was greater in younger adults compared to older adults (C.R. = -3.02). Similarly, both the association between bisexual identity (C.R. = -8.35) and health and ‘other’ identity (C.R. = -7.06) and health were greater in younger compared to older adults.   Matched Sample. The measurement model for overall health was also examined in the matched sample. Factor loadings were examined for each of the three endogenous variables that comprised our latent variable. Again, the regression path for the general health variable was set to 1.0. Physical health days had an unstandardized regression weight of 8.496 (SE (b) = .197, p < .01, CR = 43.17). Poor mental health days had an unstandardized regression weight of 5.870 (SE (b) = .132, p < .01, CR = 44.51).   Given that propensity score matching matches participants on covariates of interest and race, and education were included in the covariates matched on in this sample, the structural HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      37    equation model was tested with the matched sample without covariates. Multigroup analysis was used and the two groups were again younger adults (18-49) and older adults (50+). The model (c2(18) = 3133.10, p < .001) had a weak fit ( CFI = .687, TLI = .479, RMSEA = .092). The model accounted for 9.8 percent of the variance in overall health in younger adults and 2 percent of the variance in overall health in older adults.   Though the model fit for the matched sample was weaker than the unmatched sample, the beta levels still emerged as significant, similar to our unmatched sample. For younger adults, gay/lesbian identity (b = .149, SE(b) = .024, p <.01, CR = 6.28) bisexual identity (b = .414, SE(b) = .018, p <.01, CR = 22.50), and other sexual minority identity (b = .493, SE (b) = .029,   p <.01, CR = 17.12) were significantly associated with overall health. See Table 13 for regression weights and associated statistics for younger adults. See Figure 5 for the structural equation model.   For older adults, bisexual identity (b = .164, SE (b) = .032, p <.01, CR = 5.16) and other sexual minority identity (b = .236, SE(b) = .033,  p <.01, CR = 7.04) were significantly associated with overall health, but gay or lesbian status was not (b = .017, SE (b) = .027.  p = .522, CR = .64). See Table 14 for regression weights and associated statistics for older adults. See Figure 6 for the structural equation model.   Similar to the unmatched sample, the beta weights suggested that the association between sexual orientation and health were greater in younger adults as opposed to older adults. Critical ratios were examined to assess whether these differences were statistically significant. The associations between gay/lesbian identity (C.R. = -3.68), bisexual identity (C.R. = -6.79) and ‘other’ identity (C.R. = -5.84) were greater in younger adults than older adults.   HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      38    Research Question 2  The goal of propensity score matching was to control for any variables that might naturally vary between heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. However, given that the second research question was interested in the influence of these demographic variables (age, race, and education) I opted to only test this research question with the unmatched sample. A 4 x 3 x 2 x 2 multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was run to test whether there were significant group-level differences in the latent health variable based on sexual orientation, race, age, and education. There were significant main effects of sexual orientation (F(9, 407548.92) = 53.11, p < .01, Wilks’ l = .99, hp2 = .001), race (F(6, 334916) = 7.68, p < .01, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), age (F(3, 167548) = 135.69, p < .001, Wilks’ l = .998, hp2 = .00), and education (F(3, 167,458) = 32.39, p < .01, Wilks’ l = .99, hp2 = .00).  There were significant two-way interactions between age and education (F(3, 167458) = 5.62, p < .01, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), age and sexual orientation (F(9, 407548.92) = 5.12, p < .001, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), age and race (F(6, 334918) = 9.39, p < .01, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), education and sexual orientation (F(9, 407548.92) = 3.44, p < .001, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), education and race (F(6, 334916) = 4.35, p < .01, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00), and sexual orientation and race (F(18, 473643.24) = 2.24, p < .01, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00).   These main effects and two-way interactions were modified by significant three-way interactions between age, sexual orientation, and race (F(18, 473643) = 1.82 , p = .018, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00) and between education, sexual orientation, and race (F(18, 473643) = 1.73, p = .03, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00). There were no significant three-way interactions between age, education, and sexual orientation (F(9, 407548.92) = 1.32, p = .218, Wilks’ l = 1.0, hp2 = .00) or HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      39    between age, education, and race (F(6, 334916) = 53.11, p < .01, Wilks’ l = .99, hp2 = .00). There was no significant four-way interaction between age, education, sexual orientation, and race (F(18, 473642) = 1.27, p = .195, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .00).1 See Table 15 for the full output for the MANOVA. Given that my second research questions was concerned about how education interacted with the other variables, I only explored mean-level differences of groups based on the three-way interaction between education, sexual orientation, and race and not the three-way interaction between age, sexual orientation, and race.   I investigated the three-way interactions between age, sexual orientation, and race and between education, sexual orientation, and race by conducting post-hoc univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each of the three outcome variables. There was a significant three-way interaction between age, sexual orientation, and race for poor physical health days (F(6) = 2.58, p = .017, hp2  = .00) and poor mental health days (F(6) = 2.88, p = .008, hp2  = .000), but not for general health (F(6) = 1.66, p = .127, hp2  = .000). A similar pattern emerged for the interaction between education, sexual orientation, and race such that the three-way interaction was significant for poor physical health days (F(6) = 2.20, p = .04, hp2  = .000) and poor mental health days (F(6) = 2.39, p = .026, hp2  = .000), but not for general health (F(6) = 1.86, p = .083, hp2  = .000).  To visualize both three-way interactions, mean levels of the two poor health days outcome variables were calculated. Table 16 displays the means and standard deviations for poor  1 A similar MANOVA was conducted with a continuous age variable included, rather than a dichotomous age variable. In this case, the four-way interaction between age, education, sexual orientation, and race was significant (F(627, 498560.62) = 1.22, p < .001, Wilks’ l = 1.00, hp2 = .002. However, given that the goal of the MANOVA was to investigate mean-group differences and investigating the role of age as a continuous variable does not allow us to understand how groups of different ages fare, I opted to focus my analysis on the MANOVA that utilized the dichotomous age variable.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      40    physical and poor mental health days for groups based on their combined race, sexual orientation, and education level. Tables 7 and 8 display the estimated marginal means for each group along with the standard error. Table 7 displays poor physical health days and Table 8 displays poor mental health days.     HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      41    Chapter 5: Discussion Minority Stress Model   The Minority Stress Model states that sexual minority individuals have worse health outcomes than heterosexual individuals due to the distinct stressors queer individuals face throughout their lifetime. This stress makes them more susceptible to a variety of chronic conditions and adverse health outcomes (Meyer, 2003; Meyer & Frost, 2013). Several studies have confirmed these disparities in outcomes such as disability status (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013), psychological distress (Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017), and substance use (Blosnich et al., 2014; Gonzales & Henning-Smith, 2017). There is also evidence that these disparities are present in older LGBTQ+ adults in outcomes such as cognitive limitations, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), depression, arthritis, and self-rated health (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2013; Nelson & Andel, 2020a; Seelman, 2019).  While these disparities between sexual minority adults and their heterosexual peers are present across the lifespan, what is less clear is whether there are age differences in these disparities. There have been conflicting findings regarding whether health disparities between sexual minority adults and their heterosexual peers widen or narrow with age. The cumulative disadvantage framework posits that these disparities would accumulate with age (Dannefer, 2020) leading to larger disparities in physical and mental health outcomes in older LGBTQ+ adults. Limited empirical work suggests otherwise. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have found that health disparities between heterosexual and sexual minority individuals are smaller in older adults in terms of their self-rated health, substance use, and number of chronic conditions (Bränström et al., 2016; Nelson & Andel, 2020a; Schuler et al., 2018). Given that the empirical work studying how age influences these disparities is limited, and the fact that sexual HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      42    minority older adults are a historically understudied group (Flatt et al., 2022),  the present study sought to expand this literature.   Using a structural equation model, the present study tested whether sexual orientation (specifically gay/lesbian, bisexual, and ‘other’ sexual minority identities) predicted a latent variable of overall health. Both education and race were included in the model to control for the effects of these demographic variables. Based on the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003), the first hypothesis of the present study predicted that those identifying as sexual minorities would have worse overall health (a higher score) than those who do not. A multigroup model was used to test whether these associations differed between adults between younger adults (ages 18-49) and older adults (ages 50 plus).   The structural equation model supported the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003) such that sexual minority identities were associated with worse overall health. This supported the first hypothesis of the present study that there would be health disparities between those that identify as sexual minorities and those that do not. Specifically, for younger adults, lesbian or gay identity, bisexual identity, or other sexual minority identity were significantly associated with overall health. Other sexual minority status had the strongest association with the latent overall health, followed by bisexual identity, and gay/lesbian identity having the weakest association. This is consistent with prior work that found bisexual adults have higher levels of anxiety, depression, and negative affect than gay, lesbian, and heterosexual adults (Fredricksen-Goldsen et al., 2011).  ‘Biphobia’, which is the stigma surrounding bisexual identity that can manifest in discrimination from both heterosexual and gay or lesbian adults (Jones, 2010), may partially explains these findings. Bisexual adults often struggle with their identity, feeling a lack of HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      43    acceptance in both straight and queer groups (Hartman-Linck, 2014) and subsequently may conceal their identity and not engage in queer communities at the same rate as gay or lesbian individuals (McLean, 2008). Social support tends to moderate the impact of sexual orientation-related discrimination on physical and mental health. Low levels of social support predict higher levels of depression in sexual minority individuals (Stinchcombe et al., 2020) while higher levels of support predict better physical and mental quality of life and lower depression and anxiety in sexual minorities over the age of 50 (Masini & Barrett, 2008). Therefore, the anticipated or actual discrimination bisexual folks might face in queer spaces could deprive them of this protective factor and therefore negatively impact their health. The present study does not measure perceived discrimination, social support, or whether an individual has concealed their identity. More work is needed to understand the mechanisms explaining these disparities.  The strongest association with overall health in is identifying as some other sexual minority (not gay, lesbian, or bisexual). The BRFSS does not ask what term these individuals use to describe their sexual orientation, but it is assumed that this includes individuals identifying as asexual, pansexual, queer, or questioning (Jen, 2019). There has been increasing fluidity in the way individuals label their sexual orientation (Jones, 2019). Similar to those identifying as bisexual, those with a less well-defined or socially acknowledged identity may experience feelings of isolation or lack of community, leading to worse overall health. Those identifying as pansexual or queer report higher discrimination from heterosexual peers and higher levels of depression, when compared to bisexual individuals (Feinstein et al., 2021). Given that the present study had a sample of over 2,000 individuals identifying as “other”, it would be worthwhile to investigate 1) which identities those individuals label themselves and 2) whether HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      44    there are distinct processes happening within this group (i.e. queer and pansexual individuals having different patterns of health).   To answer the second research question of the present study, a multigroup model was used. The multigroup model assessed whether the associations between sexual orientation and health differ in younger versus older adults. In the older adult sample, even when race and education were included as covariates, the model only accounted for a very small percent of the variance in overall health (0.2 percent compared to 3.7 percent in younger adults). While this difference is not very large, this suggests that the variables that contribute to overall health (comprised of physical and mental self-rated health) might be different in older versus younger adults. Additionally, the strength of the associations between sexual orientation and overall health were smaller in older adults than younger adults across all three sexual minority identities. The critical ratios examined suggest that these differences were statistically significant. Additionally, in the matched sample, which sought to control for demographic variables, the association between gay/lesbian identity was no longer significant in older adults. Together, these findings suggest that while sexual minority status predicts worse overall health in both older and younger adults, the strength of these associations is weaker in older adults, which supports the second hypothesis of the present study.  One potential explanation for these age differences is that additional processes are having a larger impact on health in older adults that are more powerful than sexual orientation. It may the case that the aging process itself is exerting a larger influence on health than sexual identity. The age-as-leveler hypothesis theorizes the aging process “levels the playing field” such that health disparities decrease with age because age itself becomes a stronger predictor of health than any marginalized identity (House et al., 1994; Kim & Miech, 2009). The findings of the HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      45    present study are consistent with this hypothesis and other work that has found smaller health disparities in older LGBTQ+ adults (i.e. Bränström et al., 2016; Schuler et al., 2018; Nelson & Andel, 2020a). Additionally, in line with previous work that theorized that sexual minority adults might develop strategies that buffer the impact of their minority identity on their health (Infurna, 2021), similar processes might be happening here.  Not only do these disparities look different between age groups, within-group differences in sexual minority adults persist into middle and later adulthood. The association between gay or lesbian status and overall health was quite small in older adults, compared to bisexual and other identifying older adults. This is consistent with previous work that found that while disparities in substance use are only present in gay, lesbian, and heterosexual younger adults, disparities persist into later adulthood for bisexual individuals (Schuler et al., 2018).  There are a few potential explanations for these findings. As is the case with younger adults, those identifying as gay or lesbian may have had more opportunities to connect with members of the LGBTQ+ community throughout their lifetime, which may have buffered against adverse influences on their health. The ‘biphobia’ that bisexual and other identifying sexual minority persists into middle and later adulthood such that bisexual older adults are often understudied and excluded from research (Jen, 2019; Scherrer, 2017).  Similar to younger adults, older bisexual individuals are also more likely to have internalized stigma and identity concealment (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2017). Jen (2019) explored the life course perspective of bisexual aging. Older bisexual adults tend to report that they realized their sexual orientation later in life (Koh & Ross, 2006) and have experienced opposite- sex marriage, divorce, or widowhood before or during this time (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al., 2017b). They may feel off-track compared to both heterosexual and gay or lesbian peers and HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      46    that they missed out on the opportunities to embrace their full identity. This unique pattern of development related to sexual orientation and identity formation, along with experiences of ‘biphobia’ and internalized stigma, might be unique elements of minority stress that puts older bisexual adults at increased risk of physical and mental health issues.  Since the data of the present study are not longitudinal, it cannot be concluded whether these disparities decrease with age (a product of developmental change) or whether there are cohort or sample differences that explain these findings. However, given that race and education were included as control variables in the model and the age differences persisted, we can conclude that differences in these variables are likely not contributing to the differences seen between age groups.  Propensity Score Matching  While the structural equation model controlled for the demographic variables of race and education, the use of propensity score matching might be able to better account for covariates above and beyond simply controlling for them. The covariates that participants were matched on were age, race, sex, and education. Additionally, over 80 percent of the unmatched sample identified as heterosexual. This disproportionate ratio of heterosexual to sexual minority individuals had the potential to mask any intergroup differences (i.e. gay/lesbian compared to bisexual) in sexual minority individuals. Using sophisticated methodological approaches to create a sample with a more proportionate distribution gave me the opportunity to examine the sexual minority individuals more closely. While using this methodology might provide additional covariate control, with this data, the matched and unmatched samples did not tell different stories. The findings that the associations between sexual orientation and health were HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      47    smaller in older adults than younger adults were consistent in the sample generated through propensity score matching (matched sample). While the associations between sexual orientation and health were significant in the matched sample, the overall model fit was worse when compared to the unmatched sample. This suggests that there are more discrepancies between the associations depicted in the structural equation model and the actual data in the matched sample compared to the unmatched sample. It should be noted that this matched sample is less representative of the actual population the study seeks to understand. A recent Gallop poll found that currently only about 7 percent of Americans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (Jones, 2023). Therefore, the unmatched sample of the present study is more representative of the United States and can provide better ecological validity in its interpretation.  While the use of this score matching might provide better control for covariates, caution should be used in the interpretation of these findings. Matching participants based on their propensity to be in a group of interest (i.e. identifying as a sexual minority) is a newer use of the statistical tool (Nelson & Andel, 2020b). Much of the work with propensity score matching has been in clinical trials (e.g Xu & Kalbfleisch, 2010; Staffa et al., 2018). More work should be done to examine how well propensity score matching can be used in ‘naturally’ occurring subject variables (such as sexual orientation) rather than researcher manipulated conditions.  Minority Diminished Returns and Intersectionality  While controlling for demographic variables can better highlight the association between sexual orientation and health, identity-based variables do not exist in isolation from one another. Rather, the intersectional theoretical framework argues that understanding how multiple marginalized identities influence individuals’ quality of life is vital. Intersectional scholars would HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      48    argue that we cannot study sexual orientation without also studying race. Therefore, rather than controlling for those identity variables, we can also understand how they might interact to influence health.  The Minorities Diminished Returns theory states that the advantage that education offers for health outcomes is buffered by minority status (Assari, 2018). This theory has been confirmed in sexual minority individuals (Assari, 2019) along with Black and Hispanic individuals (Assari, 2018; Assari & Bazargan, 2019). This newer area of literature has investigated the isolated role of these marginalized identities on the association between education and health. Additionally, lifespan theories (i.e. cumulative disadvantage and age-as-leveler) support the idea that health disparities can either narrow (House et al., 1994) or widen (Dannefer, 2020) with age. Therefore, also examining how age interacts with education, race, and sexual orientation might highlight additional mean-group differences in overall health.  However, given that this a newer area of literature, there is not evidence for how multiple marginalized identities influence this association. The present study took an intersectional approach (Crenshaw, 1991), to better understand the Minority Diminished Returns theory. There is evidence for intersectionality in self-rated health such that education, race, and gender interact (Brown et al., 2016). I sought to understand how sexual orientation, age, and race interact with education to influence self-rated health.  The present study predicted that there would be a significant four-way interaction between education, age, race, and sexual orientation on the three outcome variables of overall health: general health, poor physical health days, and poor mental health days. While this four-way interaction did not emerge as significant, there was a significant three-way interaction between education, sexual orientation, and race. Upon further examination, this interaction was HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      49    only significant for poor physical and mental health days, and not for general health.  I do note that a post-hoc analysis that replicated the above MANOVA with continuous age rather than age split dichotomously did yield a significant four-way interaction. However, the goal of using the age variable spilt at 50 was to examine group-level differences. While this significant four-way interaction tells us that age does interact with sexual orientation, race, and education, it does not tell us much about intersectionality. Given that I was interested in examining how groups based on multiple identities (e.g. race, sexual orientation, and age) experience health and well-being, I opted to further explore the interaction terms in the original MANOVA (with age split at 50).  Inspection of the means showed the directional nature of the third hypothesis was not fully supported. It was predicted that those identifying at Black or Hispanic, with a sexual minority identity, and a low educational attainment would have the worst health. However, the group with the highest number of poor physical health days was White individuals identifying as some “other” sexual minority and with lower educational attainment. This did not support the prediction that White individuals would have better health than Black and Hispanic individuals, however Black individuals identifying as “other” sexual minority with both low and high educational attainment had relatively high (though slightly lower than White individuals of the same sexual orientation and educational attainment) number of poor physical health days (means of 5.79 and 5.77, respectively). Additionally, Hispanic individuals identifying as “other” and with high educational attainment also had relatively high levels of poor physical health days (5.86).  These findings related to poor physical health days are consistent with the structural equation model from the present study that those identifying as some “other” sexual minority have the worst health. Within each of the three racial groups included, those identifying as HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      50    “other” had the highest number of poor physical health days. Interestingly, marginalized racial identity did not exacerbate these sexual orientation differences as White individuals identifying as “other” had the worst physical health. However, as predicted and in line with research examining socioeconomic differences in health, those with lower educational attainment tended to have the worst physical health, across both sexual orientation and racial groups.  For poor mental health days, White bisexual individuals with low education had the highest number (11.98 days). White bisexuals with high education had lower, though still elevated, poor mental health days (8.23 days). Similar to physical health, the prediction that Black or Hispanic sexual minority individuals would have the worst mental health was not supported. While White bisexuals with lower education had the worst mental health, Hispanic and Black bisexual individuals were not far behind. Hispanic bisexual individuals with high and low educational attainment had high, but relatively equal number of poor mental health days (10.78 and 10.34 days, respectively). Of Black participants, bisexual individuals with lower educational attainment had the highest number of poor mental health days (9.45 days). Across all racial groups, those identifying as bisexual tended to have the worst mental health which follows the same pattern as “other” sexual minorities for physical health. These findings are not consistent with prior literature that has found Black sexual minority individuals tend to fare worse than White sexual minority individuals in terms of mental well-being (Calabrese et al., 2015), stress (McConnell et al., 2018), and the impact of discriminatory policies on anxiety symptoms and substance use (English et al., 2021). While the differences in health among White, Black, and Hispanic sexual minorities were not very pronounced, the finding that Black and Hispanic sexual minorities were not faring worse than their White counterparts is of interest.  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      51    It has been shown that White sexual minority individuals hold their sexual orientation as more central to their identity while Black sexual minority individuals hold their race as central to their identity (Hagai et al., 2020). Therefore, those that do not have the burden of a marginalized racial identity (White individuals) might internalize some of the stressors related to their sexual orientation to a greater extent than those balancing the burden of both a marginalized racial and sexual orientation group. Those stressors, combined with a lower educational attainment might negatively impact their health. However, these findings might suggest something about the resilience of Black and Hispanic sexual minorities.  Black and Hispanic individuals might also have developed coping strategies or resilience regarding their experiences as a racially marginalized individual. These strategies might have carried over to their ability to deal with sexual orientation-related stressors and these stressors might not impact their health to as great of a degree.  Another caveat to mention when interpreting these findings is that the difference in sample sizes. For example, there is a sample of 989 White “other” adults with lower educational attainment while there are only 112 Black “other” adults with lower education and 56 with higher education. There were only 69 adults that were Hispanic, “other” and with higher educational attainment. These difference in sample sizes are not necessarily the reason why White sexual minority folks tend to have worse health. However, a sample of less than 200 Black individuals identifying as some “other” sexual minority is going to be less representative of the population of individuals with that identity. Therefore, there is likely less variability within that sample of individuals than the almost 1,000 White “other” sexual minority individuals. These racial differences may not be fully representative of the population and should be interpreted HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      52    with caution. However, reporting and disseminating the data of groups with small cell sizes can be useful for meta-analytic research.   The effect sizes of the significant multivariate interaction terms were also very small. These effect sizes suggest that there might be other processes not captured in the present study that are having a more significant impact on health and well-being. Other variables such as perceived discrimination (Breder & Bockting, 2022) or social support (Cohen & McKay, 2020) can exacerbate or buffer the impact of minority identity on health. Therefore, models and analyses that include these variables likely will explain a greater amount of variance in health between groups. Additionally, the outcome variable used in the present study (general health on a five-point Likert scale and number of poor physical and mental health days in the past month) might not fully capture the health disparities that exist between these groups. While these variables were the only measures of overall health status in the current dataset, more work should be done to examine whether they are the best markers of health and can best detect health disparities.  While race itself might not be exacerbating disparities related to sexual orientation in this sample, the significant three-way interaction and the mean-level differences do suggest that education might be less beneficial for Black and Hispanic sexual minorities than for White sexual minorities. For example, the differences in poor physical health days between low and high education groups is more distinct in White “other” sexual minorities compared to Black and Hispanic “other” sexual minorities (a difference of 1.35 days compared to a difference of .02 and .79 days, respectively). This suggests that White sexual minorities are having fewer poor physical health days if they have high educational attainment compared to if they have low, while education is not offering the same benefit for Black and Hispanic sexual minorities. This HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      53    finding is novel in that the Minority Diminished Returns Theory has studied these variables in isolation (Assari, 2018, 2019), but these findings confirm that they interact with one another.  While White sexual minorities are reporting high numbers of poor health days, it seems that education can offer them a benefit that it does not for Black and Hispanic sexual minorities. It may be the case that examining all three variables (race, sexual orientation, and education) can highlight which groups are 1) suffering from the worst health and 2) which groups are benefiting the most from socioeconomic resources. Perhaps for individuals with multiple marginalized identities, interventions that go beyond increasing education or other SES-related resources are necessary to improve health. Future work should examine if other resources can be harnessed for these individuals that offer more of a benefit on their health and well-being. Intervention work might also assess whether there are points in development that are most effective for these resources to be implemented.   Intersectionality encourages studying the influence of power, structural barriers, and interlocking identities on quality of life for those of marginalized identities (Crenshaw, 1991; McCall, 2005; Nash, 2008).  Therefore, I caution the interpretation of these findings that White sexual minorities somehow have it worse than Black or Hispanic sexual minorities. It is more likely that differences between racial groups alone is not enough to fully understand how these groups are experiencing their health and well-being. There has been a push in the field to label disparities between racial groups as due to racism rather than just race. (Chokshi et al., 2022; Pearson et al., 2021).Therefore, it may not be enough to study racial differences in health, but rather the impact of racism (both interpersonally and systematically). Additionally, understanding how education and other socioeconomic resources impact these group-level HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      54    differences can highlight an additional “layer” of intersectionality that could explain these disparities.  Another key element of intersectionality is using research to enact change in the lives of those with multiple marginalized identities (Moradi & Grzanka, 2017). Research with an intersectional lens should examine how findings can be used to improve well-being. For example, research could investigate why Black and Hispanic sexual minorities are benefitting less from education than their White counterparts. Are other socioeconomic resources having a greater impact? Does the current education system not consider the needs of those from non-Eurocentric backgrounds? These questions can help translate work such as the present study to enact change in systems that might benefit the individuals studied.   Limitations The present study has several limitations. As mentioned, the BRFSS data does not include several variables that likely explain additional variability in health such as: perceived discrimination, structural inequity, or social support. These variables likely explain a greater amount of variability in health and well-being. The inclusion of these variables in the present study likely would have allowed for better model fit in the structural equation model, and greater effect sizes for the MANOVA interaction terms. The present study assessess how disparities exist, which is a first step to highlight how demographic variables influence health. It was concluded that ‘biphobia’ likely contributed to bisexual and “other” sexual minorities having worse health, but the current data cannot confirm that. Measuring variables like internalized homophobia, connections to the LGBTQ+ community, and discrimination from other queer individuals might more clearly link these findings to elements of “biphobia.”  HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      55    In addition to variables that might explain the association between sexual orientation and health, similar variables could explain racial disparities as well. As mentioned, rather than attributing health disparities to race, racism is the more appropriate influence. The present study does not assess how either systemic forms of racism (e.g., housing inequity or wage gaps) or interpersonal forms of racism (e.g., healthcare provider bias or microaggressions) influence health. Measuring these variables, in addition to mediators of sexual orientation-related disparities would provide a more holistic view of minority health.  Finally, while self-rated health is a widely used marked of health and predictive of mortality (Wuorela et al., 2020), there are limitations with self-reported data. There is the possibility of bias and social desirability when participants are providing data about their own physical and mental health status. They may under or over report how many days in the past month their health was impacted. There may also be differences based on race/ethnicity or age in the likelihood to disclose physical or mental health concerns, which is beyond the scope of the present study. As mentioned, the effect sizes of the MANOVA analysis indicate that the outcome variables used may not be the best indicators of health and well-being and may not best detect health disparities between groups.  Finally, the present study did not comprehensively capture all elements of identity that could influence health and well-being. The BRFSS includes Hispanic ethnicity as a response option for race. Ethnicity and race are two separate constructs and the mechanisms that explain race-based and ethnicity-based health disparities likely are different. Therefore, drawing conclusions about racial-based health disparities from data that is not exclusively measuring race can lead to inaccurate interpretations of the findings. Additionally, to ensure adequate sample sizes in individual groups, the present study did not consider the role of sex or gender. Having HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      56    too many independent variables included in the model likely would have divided the participants into groups that were too small to draw meaningful conclusions.  Future Directions  In addition to further understanding how those in the “other” group specifically identify, future work can utilize longitudinal data to assess how these disparities might accumulative with age. We might be able to assess whether bisexual, pansexual, or queer adults’ health is changing at different rates or patterns than gay, lesbian, or heterosexual adults. This can highlight disparities within the LGTBQ+ community and potential points of intervention to reduce the likelihood of adverse health outcomes. More detailed data about specific identities might provide more insight in these age-related findings. Findings from the present study do provide promising evidence that these disparities might decrease with age. However, it is unclear whether this is because sexual minority individuals are developing resilience-based strategies to cope with their minority stress or whether the healthiest and most well-adapted are the ones surviving into later adulthood. As sexual minority individuals develop into the later years of their life, future work should focus on age differences within older sexual minority adults (i.e. those from age 70-90). The use longitudinal data to follow these individuals throughout adulthood can help tease apart the impact of age versus cohort. The cohorts of younger and older sexual minority individuals likely have been impacted by the different cultural and societal events throughout the lifetimes. These likely are impacting the way they are experiencing their sexual orientation and how those experiences have impacted their health.    HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      57    Conclusions  The present study uses a dataset with over 10,000 sexual minority individuals to explore differences both within groups of the LGBTQ+ community and between different cohorts of these groups. While the data had limitations, it includes one of the largest samples of sexual minorities available. Bisexual and “other” sexual minority adults are faring worse in terms of their physical and mental health, even across racial groups. These findings demonstrate that the LGBTQ+ community may not provide support for all members. The combination of homophobia from those outside the LGBTQ+ community and a lack of acceptance from those within it might act as a “double jeopardy” and place these bisexual and “other” sexual minorities at an increased risk of adverse physical and mental health outcomes.  The findings that these disparities are smaller in older adults than younger adults do have promising implications for resilience. While longitudinal data is needed to attribute these age-differences to either the aging process or cohort differences, there is the possibility that older sexual minority adults are developing strategies to deal with their minority stress such that it is less harmful on their health. However, there is the possibility that age is acting as leveler in that the aging process is impacting all adults similarly, regardless of sexual orientation. This supports the lifespan developmental principle that development continues into later adulthood (Baltes et al., 1980). Sexual minority individuals may have better well-being in the latter half of their lifespan. As the current generation of younger sexual minority adults ages into later adulthood, longitudinal data and more advanced methodology can hopefully provide more insight into these processes.  The present study goes one step further to examine how interlocking identities influence health. Building on the Minorities Diminished Returns theory (Assari, 2018), I found that HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      58    education offers a benefit for White sexual minorities’ health that it seemingly does not for Black or Hispanic sexual minorities. This demonstrates that education might not be a “one size fits all” solution to health inequity. Rather, other resources could offer more benefits to those with multiple marginalized identities, or the current education system could better account for the needs of racial and ethnic minorities to offer protection from their minority stress .HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INTERSECTIONALITY                                                      59    References  Adamczyk, A., & Liao, Y.

    "abstract": "Sexual orientation, age, and race are all identity-based variables that can contribute to health disparities (Dannefer, 2020; Meyer, 2003; Forde et al., 2019). The minority diminished returns (MDR) theory states that marginalized identities (i.e. race and sexual orientation) dampen the positive impact education has on physical and mental health (Assari, 2018). Some evidence suggests that health disparities narrow in older sexual minority adults (Nelson & Andel, 2020a) but this question has not been asked with nationally representative data, and research with older sexual minorities is limited. The present study explored whether 1) age dampens or exacerbates disparities in self-rated health due to sexual orientation and 2) multiple marginalized identities (sexual orientation, age, and race) interact with education in their influence on health. The study utilized data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from the CDC with an overall sample size of 167, 508. Structural equation modeling (SEM) found that lesbian/gay, bisexual, and “other” sexual minority identities were associated with worse overall health and these associations were significantly smaller in participants over the age of 50 than those younger than 50. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) found a significant education by sexual orientation by race interaction for number of poor physical and mental health days. Investigation into the means found that White bisexual and “other” sexual minorities with low education had the worse mental and physical health, respectively. However, Black and Hispanic individuals of the same sexual orientation and education had elevated, though slightly lower number of poor health days. These findings suggest that 1) sexual minority individuals might be developing resilience in the face of their minority stress as they age and 2) examining race, sexual orientation, and education together can highlight health disparities not seen when looking at these variables independently",
