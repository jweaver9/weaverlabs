This figure is based on Alfred Kinsey’sstudies conducted in the 1940s and 1950s (Marcus, 1993). Because approximately 1 in 10people in our society is gay or lesbian, it may be assumed that around 10% of adolescentstudents are gay males or lesbians as well.Adolescence is marked as a time of exploration,commitment, evaluation, and of finding one’s identity.Therefore, adolescence plays an important role in theawareness of sexual orientation. According to Santrock(1996), a study conducted in 1993 concluded that the averageage homosexual boys realized they were gay was 12.5 years.Herdt and Boxer (1993) further report that boys engaged intheir first same-sex encounter at the age of 13.1 years.Most of the participants in these studies reported feelingconfused and upset at the onset of their homosexualfeelings. Societies’ norms and values may be to blame.The American culture stigmatizes homosexuality. Manyfeel that same-sex relationships are unnatural and sinful.There are beliefs that AIDS is a plague sent by God toeliminate homosexuals. Other people believe that homosexualssuffer from mental illnesses and are curable of their“ disorder” . Still others hold beliefs that gay and lesbianpeople are more likely to molest children than areheterosexuals. The statistics indicate, however, that2sexual-abuse crimes are most likely committed byheterosexuals— usually men abusing girls (Chandler, 1997).Overall, there are many mistaken beliefs in the Americanrealm of society that regard homosexuality as a negative wayof life.This most likely has damaging effects on the adolescents who are struggling with theirsexual orientation. Hyde and Forsyth (1994) suggest that “it is virtually impossible togrow up without becoming at least somewhat homophobic” (p. 10). The growth anddevelopment of adolescents in this society makes them susceptible to internalizing someof these negative beliefs. Gonsiorek (1993) reveals that “one of the greatest impedimentsto the mental health of gay and lesbian individuals is ‘internalized homophobia’” (p.474). According to Barkai (1996) internalized homophobia may be defined as“homophobia which is directed against the self because one senses and consequentlyfears one’s own element of homosexuality” (p. 10). Adolescents have heard and evenspoken such anti-gay remarks as “you are so gay”, “what a fag”, and “you dyke” – eachof which involves extremely negative connotations in these contexts. Adolescents knowthat their homosexuality is negatively regarded by society. In consequence, manyhomosexual teens become invisible members of society.Some homosexual adolescents choose to hide their sexualorientation. Hiding one’s sexual orientation, however, cancreate a painful discrepancy between public and privateidentities. Consequently, they “ may feel inauthentic, thatthey are living a lie, and that others would not accept themif they knew the truth”  (Gonsiorek & Weinrich, 1991, p.74).3Other individuals, however, find that they are not ableto hide their sexual orientations. These people get teasedand ridiculed because of their mannerisms. They violatesocieties’ gender roles. For example, females who displaymasculine characteristics and males who display femininecharacteristics are often thought to be homosexual. Whetheror not they indeed have affectionate feelings for people ofthe same sex is another matter. These people are tormentedand ridiculed often on a daily basis because of the way theyact and sometimes because of the way they dress. Much ofthis occurs in the education system.Herek and Berrill (1992) report that “ anti-gayprejudice and violence are serious problems at many collegesand universities”  (p. 32). Their evidence reveals that over1,300 anti-gay actions were reported by lesbian and gaygroups on forty college campuses alone in 1990. Theperpetrators of these homophobic actions are often youngmales ages twenty-one and under. A study conduced by Van deVen (1994) revealed that high school students, however, maybe even more homophobic than undergraduates when consideringcertain variables.According to Chandler (1997), a New York State studyinvestigating bias-related violence found that “ junior andsenior high school students were most disapproving of gays,more so than of any other minority group. Remarks abouthomosexuals were often ‘openly vicious’”  (p. 42).  Pollackand Schwartz (1995) warn that “ name-calling is harassment4regardless of who does it, and it is considered a hate crimeby the federal government”  (p. 73). Adolescents are alsobeing punched, kicked, pushed, and beaten because of theirhomosexual status. Statistics reveal that sixty-five percentof gay males and lesbians experience verbal or physicalassault in high schools (Littig & Long, 1995). Thirty-threeto forty-nine percent of respondents in another studyconducted in nine United States cities in Maine, Wisconsin,and Pennsylvania experienced anti-gay threats, harassment,and/or violence while in high school or junior high school(Herek & Berrill, 1992).The purpose of this study is to investigate thestrategies and resources schools utilize to prevent orreduce homophobia in a select number of Wisconsin publicschools.The studies concerning homophobia in the school system have revealed that there areproblems that need to be addressed. Homophobic beliefs are prominent in high schoolsand middle schools which often result in a percentage of students going to school withoutfeeling accepted, valued, or safe. The results of this study may provide valuableinformation about the homophobic feelings and actions of high school students, and thevarious strategies that are being utilized to prevent and reduce homophobia.5CHAPTER IIReview of LiteratureThe literature review will focus on the topics ofsexual orientation, homophobia, and the effects ofhomophobia on gay and lesbian adolescents. Prevention andintervention strategies that may be used in the schoolsystem will also be addressed.Sexual OrientationPollack and Schwartz (1995) define sexual orientationas the gender or genders a person has feelings of attractionand affection toward. Additionally, it refers to“ behaviors, emotions, fantasies, attitudes, self-identification, and sexual and life-style preferencesregarding one’s choice of intimate partners”  (Fassinger,61991, p. 158). Sexual orientation ranges fromheterosexuality (having affectionate feelings for people ofthe opposite sex), homosexuality (having feelings ofaffection for people of the same sex), and bisexuality(having feelings of attraction towards both men and women).Owens (1998) reveals that sexual orientation is not achoice. Rather, it is a sense of inner identity.For some time, the issue over whether homosexual andbisexual orientations are “ normal”  has been debated. Thereare those who believe that homosexuality is a normalorientation. One argument is that homosexuality has alwaysexisted. According to Bullough (1979), “ homosexualityexisted in ancient Egypt, in the Tigris-Euphrates Valley, inancient China, and in ancient India”  (p. 2). Anotherargument stressing the normality of homosexuality is thathomosexual behavior occurs in many different species of theanimal kingdom and many different cultures as well. Forexample, most South American indigenous peoples considerhomosexuality to be normal, healthy, and accepted (Owens,1998). Others, however, believe that homosexuality is wrongand deviates from the norm.According to Hyde and Forsyth (1994), although theAmerican Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality as adiagnosis of mental illness in 1973, many people stillbelieve that homosexuality is a sickness and should beclassified as a disorder. Other people cite religiousbeliefs as a reason not to accept homosexuality. Many7religious institutions believe homosexuality is sinful,immoral, and a threat to the “ traditional”  Americanfamily.HomophobiaFor whatever reasons a person chooses not to accepthomosexuality, homophobia is often the result. According toPollack and Schwartz (1995), homophobia is the “ irrationalfear, dislike, or hatred of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals”(p. 49). Hyde and Forsyth (1994) further suggest thatprejudice against homosexuals is that last acceptableprejudice in the United States. In fact, the United Statesremains one of the most hostile modern western societiestoward homosexuals (Owens, 1998). The wrath of thishomophobia is apparent in the armed services, in civilianemployment, and in educational settings.According to Gonsiorek and Weinrich (1991),discrimination against gay men and lesbians isinstitutionally supported in the military. Those who aresuspected of homosexuality are often intensely interrogated.The military has dishonorably discharged many homosexualsbased solely on their sexual orientation. Marcus (1993)indicates reasons the military has given for excludinghomosexuals from the services. They include: security risks(homosexuals could be blackmailed by threatening to revealtheirlifestyle); the impairment of discipline, morale, andcohesiveness among troops; and the uncomfortable feelings8heterosexuals may have that someone is watching them. A 1989study conducted by the Pentagon concluded, however, thathomosexuals do not present greater security risks and do notdisrupt the armed forces (Marcus, 1993).Homophobia also occurs in civilian employment. Manyhomosexuals fear the loss of their jobs if they reveal theirhomosexuality. In many places “ it is perfectly legal tofire someone simply because he or she is gay”  (Marcus,1993, p. 103). Morgan and Brown (1993) further report a 1987study that concluded three-fourths of lesbians surveyedbelieved they would lose their jobs or income if theydisclosed their lesbian identity.Homophobia not only affects the military and employmentsectors of society, but the schools as well. Schools, wherediversity and pluralism are ideally cherished, instead oftenperpetuate homophobia in American society.The effects of homophobia most likely begin as early asin the elementary school. Gonsiorek (1993) reveals thatnames such as “ queer”  and “ fag”  are used as put-downs.Even at this age, homosexual labels are given negativeconnotations. According to Eder, Evans, and Parker (1995),the meanings of the terms, however, are often notunderstood.As children grow older and enter adolescence, name-calling intensifies and gains meaning. Gonsiorek (1993)reveals that “ during adolescence, individuals are morepolarized in their sex roles than at any other time in their9lives”  (p. 473). Males experience pressures to be “ tough”while females experience pressures to be “ passive” .Individuals who do not conform to these roles, whether ornot they are homosexual, are often subjected to taunts andverbal abuse. These acts positively reinforce heterosexualorientations while portraying homosexuality in a negativeway.Although schools are thought to be safe learningenvironments, statistics reveal otherwise. Gay and lesbianyouth are frequent targets of violence (Herek & Berrill,1992). According to Hunter (1990), over half of gay andlesbian youth report regular verbal abuse whileapproximately 35 percent report physical assaults from theirpeers. Owens (1998) reveals that constant verbal abuseassociated with homophobia can become intolerable. Studentsmay find it all but impossible to experience classroomsuccess.Effects of Homophobia on AdolescentsAdolescents have been raised in a homophobic culture.The harassment and violence that develops from these beliefsfurther impedes the progress of homosexual rights.Adolescents who may be struggling with their sexual identitydevelop an awareness of being different. They quickly learnthat they are negatively regarded by society. Theconsequences of this can be devastating.According to D’Augelli and Hershberger (1993), morethan half of gay, lesbian, and bisexual teens and young10adults fear disclosing their sexual orientation to theirfamilies. Of those who do disclose their homosexuality,twenty-six percent are thrown out of their homes by parents(Littig & Long, 1995). Gonsiorek (1993) further reports thathomosexual adolescents “ are rejected, mistreated, or becomethe focus of the family’s dysfunction”  (p. 473).According to Littig and Long (1995), the anti-homosexual harassment that adolescents endure in schoolsresults in a twenty-eight percent drop out rate. Adolescentsare forced to drop out of high school simply because theirsexual orientation is rejected.The lack of support that struggling adolescents receivefrom peers and family often has disturbing results.According to Mastoon (1997), some adolescents feel sohopeless and terrified that ending their lives seems to bethe only option. Hyde and Forsyth (1994) reveal thathomosexual adolescents are two to three times more likely toattempt suicide than heterosexual youth. Thirty percent ofall suicides each year are completed by lesbian and gayyouth (Littig & Long, 1995). Remafedi, Farrow, and Deisher(1993) reveal that “ risk factors include ‘coming out’ at ayoung age, gender atypicality, low self-esteem, substanceabuse, running away, involvement in prostitution, and otherpsychosocial morbidities”  (p. 487).Prevention and Intervention Strategies11Homophobic language and violence are a reality inAmerican schools. Owens (1998) reveals that American schoolscontinue to remain one of the most homophobic institutionsin the United States. Children are ostracized because theylook, dress, or act different. Prevention strategies may beuseful to develop support for gay and lesbian youth in theschool system.Homosexual youth may benefit from support groups suchas Gay-Straight Alliances. According to Bennett (1997),these groups serve as a safe place for gay and straightstudents to discuss sexual orientation issues. They havebeen a major influence in helping teens create openly gaylives. Support groups are beneficial to students becausethey allow students to develop social skills, find supportand understanding from peers, discuss sexuality, shareinformation, and socialize (Gonsiorek, 1993).It may be useful to train educators and counselorsabout homosexuality. School adults often set standards forbehaviors and attitudes in schools. Yet many gay andlesbian students believe teachers and counselors to beunconcerned, insensitive, ill informed, and detached whenaddressing homosexual issues (Owens, 1998). Herdt and Boxer(1993) assert that teachers are not typically viewed assources of protection or assistance. Therefore, it may beuseful to provide information to counselors and educatorsabout homosexuality and homophobia. Knowledgeable12presenters, written resources, relevant media, and smallgroup discussions may all contribute to successfulinservices for school staff.Training educators and counselors may also help reducehomophobia by easing homosexuality into the classroomcurriculum. Homosexual adolescents and those struggling withany sexual orientation issues in their family or friendswould likely benefit from a curriculum that includeseducation about the homosexual population. Hyde and Forsyth(1994) reveal that education about gay men and lesbianscontinues to be uncommon in schools. Homosexuality is oftenlimited to sex education courses. It may be helpful toincorporate gay and lesbian issues into history, familyliving, literature, and civil rights courses as well.Reading and writing assignments, class presentations, andclass discussions about current gay events may helpencourage students analyze their own perceptions ofhomosexuality and how homophobia has impacted their lives.Homophobia in schools may be prevented or reduced whenadults in schools stop hurtful language and provide visiblesupport. According to Bennet (1997), ninety-seven percent ofstudents have heard anti-gay comments such as “ you are sogay”  without a response from teachers. On occasion,teachers have been heard contributing their own anti-homosexual jokes or comments (Owens, 1998).  Therefore,being proactive in classrooms and hallways may help toprevent hurtful language. “ Name it, claim it, stop it”  is13a method that teachers and counselors have adopted toaddress negative terminology attacking homosexuality.Providing visible support may also be helpful forstudents. Support may include the presence of library books,outside speakers, drama presentations, gay-friendly symbolsand posters, brochures and information packets, and peer-leader training. Any one of these methods may be positiveways to indicate to adolescents that homosexuality is normaland accepted in their school.14CHAPTER IIIMethodologyPurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate thestrategies and resources schools utilize to prevent orreduce homophobia in a select number of Wisconsin publicschools.The objectives of this study are to determine whatstrategies and resources are available at the middle andhigh school levels, and to investigate what actions schoolstake to enforce the freedom of sexual orientation.Instrumentation A structured telephone interview (Appendix A) wasdeveloped by the researcher to gather information onprevention and intervention strategies. The questionnaireconsisted of seven interview questions. The researcherdesigned the questionnaire to assess counselors’ perceptionsof the number of homosexuals in their school community, theawareness of homophobic feelings or actions againsthomosexuals, the intervention process involved at theadministrative level, and the strategies and resourcesavailable to prevent or reduce homophobia in the school.ParticipantsThe researcher obtained a list of all Wisconsin publichigh schools involved in the Wisconsin InterscholasticAthletic Association from the web addresshttp://www.wiaawi.org/cgi/wiaadata.pl?directory. The WIAA15divided schools into small, medium, and large districtsaccording to their enrollment census figures. The researcherrandomly selected a total of eighteen school districts toparticipate in the study. The schools included six large,six medium, and six small districts. Schools were furtherdivided into three high schools and three middle schoolswithin each of the six districts. The researcher randomlyselected schools from the following districts toparticipate:Belmont School District – small          Hilbert School District – smallNew Auburn School District – small          Princeton School District – smallWhite Lake School District – small         Wonewoc School District – smallAlgoma School District – medium          Colby School District – mediumLake Mills School District – medium          Mosinee School District – mediumMount Horeb School District – medium          Pardeeville School District – mediumGreen Bay School District – large          Brookfield School District – largeBurlington School District – large            New Richmond School District – largeOconomowoc School District – large          Sheboygan School District – largeA counselor from each of the school districts was asked to participate in thisstudy. Eighteen counselors answered the prepared survey questions.Research ProceduresThe researcher called counselors from the selected public schools in April andMay of 2000. The researcher provided an explanation of the survey, and assuredparticipants of confidentiality and anonymity. After participants provided their informedconsent as participating volunteers, the researcher initialed and dated the consent forms.16Participants provided information for this study by answering questions from a seven-item phone questionnaire developed by the researcher. Upon completion of the phonesurvey, counselors were provided an opportunity to relate observations, opinions, orquestions they had.Data AnalysisThe information that counselors provided was formattedand examined to determine what prevention and interventionstrategies are being utilized to help prevent or reducehomophobia in Wisconsin public schools. The researcherexamined information from counselors from high school andmiddle school levels, as well as information based on schoolsize.17CHAPTER IVResultsThe objectives of this study are to determine what strategies and resources areavailable at the middle and high school levels to prevent or reduce homophobia, and toinvestigate what action schools take to enforce the freedom of sexual orientation. Ninemiddle school and nine high school counselors participated in this study. This populationof counselors included those employed by six small, six medium, and six large-sizedschool districts.Middle SchoolFive counselors revealed that they knew of gay men or lesbians in their schoolcommunity—including parents, teachers, students, administration, or counselors. Fourcounselors were unaware of any person in their school community who could bedescribed as homosexual.All nine counselors revealed that some level of homophobia was evident in theirschool. For example, students often used language that negatively portrayedhomosexuality. Students used words such as “fag” and “queer” in each school. Accordingto counselors, the response from teachers varied. Some teachers approached students and18indicated the inappropriate use of those words. Most middle school teachers, it seemed,did not address the issue.The response of counselors varied as well. One counselor indicated that there wasa very low level of homophobia in his/her school. When asked if students used the words“fag” or “queer”, he/she replied, “Oh yes! These words are used on a daily basis. But kidsare just saying the words. They are not relating them to a gay person.” Other counselors19approached the negative use of language differently. Three counselors indicated that theyimmediately explained the inappropriate use of those words and told students to stopsaying negative things. Physical violence has also been an issue in some Wisconsinmiddle schools.In one school, students were thrown into lockers if they were suspected to behomosexual. Confrontations occurred in classrooms as well. The counselor once found aboy crying and hiding under a table. The boy told him that other boys harassed him in thelocker room. At another school, a counselor revealed that a student was assumed gay andwas physically harassed. The evidence of homophobia at the middle school level isapparent.At every school that was interviewed, there was a sexual harassment policy. Mostcounselors indicated that if a student harassed another student, the principal or counselortalked with that person about inappropriate language and behavior. They warned that ifthe behavior continued, the student would be expelled from school, and in some cases,charges would be filed. Thus far, no student has ever been expelled from any of the ninemiddle schools due to homophobic sexual harassment.Counselors indicated various strategies and resources utilized in their schools toprevent or reduce homophobia. In one middle school, a gay-lesbian panel presentedinformation to teachers about homosexuality and homophobia. Teachers were required toattend the seminar.Six schools incorporated classes into their curriculum to cover the subject ofhomosexuality. One school included a “Family Living” course that examined the feelings20of all people involved when homosexuality became an issue. Another school included a“Teen Issues” class that focused on communication skills and defined offensiveterminology. Three counselors indicated that their health classes “probably” coveredhomosexuality. In a “Human Growth and Development” class, the topic was “touchedon”. One counselor covered homosexuality during classroom guidance. Two counselorsrevealed there were no classes covering homosexuality in their school.Two counselors suggested that their schools provided visible support bydisplaying reading materials as another prevention and intervention strategy. In oneschool, the library had materials that covered general differences among people. Aguidance office in another school had “a few booklets directly related to homosexuality.”There were various outside agencies that two counselors believed to be useful.One counselor suggested the Violence Intervention Project from their community. Theother counselor indicated hospitals as resources, and a gay youth hotline for students tocall. Two counselors indicated that they had no community resources to benefit fromconcerning homosexuality.Three schools incorporated themes into their school strategies. Two schools used“Respect and Tolerance” as themes. In another school, a theme entitled “Is it Flirting orHurting?” addressed general harassment to students at the beginning of the school year.Homosexuality was indirectly addressed with these themes.To review, middle school strategies that have been used to prevent or reducehomophobia include: teacher inservices, classes in the curriculum, visible support such asreading materials, outside agencies, and school themes.21High SchoolFive high school counselors indicated their awareness of gay or lesbian membersof their school community. Four counselors were unaware of any person in their schoolcommunity who could be described as homosexual.All nine counselors revealed that some level of homophobia was evident in theirschools. One counselor revealed that students displayed feelings of non-acceptance, lackof tolerance, and misunderstanding toward homosexuals. The counselor heard a studentthat day exclaim, “I want to be a police officer so I can beat up all the gay guys!”Counselors indicated that students are often picked on verbally. In one highschool, two young men dropped out within the last two years because they were teasedand harassed on a daily basis. Homophobia also involved posters about homosexualitybeing ripped down or written on, graffiti on notebooks, notes shoved in lockers, andvandalism of lockers and belongings. Three of the nine counselors warned thathomophobia may exist among staff as well. One counselor voiced that “some teachers areso tied up in their own beliefs that they end up shutting kids out.”Counselors from all nine schools indicated that the school sexual harassmentpolicy would be followed if harassment occurred. Students would be asked to identifywho harassed them, what exactly was said or done, and to provide names of witnesses.School officials would approach the source(s) of the harassment, and warn them of parentnotification, suspension, and legal action if the behavior continued.Other strategies were used to combat homophobia in schools as well. One highschool was in the process of developing a Gay-Straight Alliance. Three high schools usedpresentations and other informative methods to address homosexuality and homophobia.22For example, in one school a college theatre group conducted a program on sexualharassment. In another school, a Safe Staff program was incorporated. School staffattended the program on a voluntary basis. They received stickers that indicated theywere safe people to talk to about homosexual issues. In another school, the WisconsinDepartment of Public Instruction and Gay-Straight Alliance representatives educatedfaculty about homophobia.Six high schools incorporated classes such as “Sociology”, “Health”, “AmericanStudies”, “Decision-Making”, and “Conflict-Resolution” to address homosexuality andhomophobia. One counselor included homosexuality as a topic during classroomguidance. Another counselor indicated that no courses were offered in their district.Two counselors indicated they used visible support to address homosexuality.Posters, rainbows, and Safe Staff stickers were displayed in school classrooms andhallways to proclaim their support. Six counselors revealed that community agencieswere utilized as well. One school district employed a counselor from an outside agency toaddress certain issues. Students attended teen support groups in nearby communities intwo of the schools that were interviewed. One counselor indicated that there were nocommunity resources that would be valuable to address homosexuality. Last, two highschools incorporated themes of “Tolerance of Difference” to address homosexuality.In summary, high schools utilized a variety of prevention and interventionstrategies to prevent or reduce homophobia. They included: a Gay-Straight Alliance,presentations and other informative methods, classes in the curriculum, visible supportsuch as posters and stickers, community agencies, and school themes.23School SizeAmong the six counselors from small schools, two could identify a homosexualmember of their school community. Homophobia in the small schools ranged from sometolerance to complete non-acceptance. In one school, homosexuals were not targeted,rather African Americans were. Small schools used a variety of prevention methods toprevent or reduce homophobia. Two schools used community agencies, four includedclasses in the curriculum, and two incorporated classroom guidance.Among the counselors from medium size schools, four could identify homosexualmembers of their school community. Counselors indicated that name-calling occurred,but was not targeted to one specific person thought to be gay. Vandalism occurred at onemedium-sized school. Homophobia was prevented or reduced using various methods thatdiffered slightly from small schools. Four schools included classes in the curriculum,three empowered a school theme, three utilized community agencies, and two providedinformation to faculty and students. One school incorporated four strategies into theirschool. Another school did not provide any methods to address homosexuality andhomophobia.Four counselors from large schools could identify homosexual members of theirschool community. The homophobia expressed by students from large schools did notdiffer from small or medium size schools. One counselor revealed that some boys becamenervous if they sat too close, and students participated in more verbal abuse thanphysical. Large schools utilized similar methods to combat homophobia. Four schoolsincluded classes in the curriculum, three utilized community agencies, three providedinformation to faculty and students, and one was forming a Gay-Straight Alliance.24CHAPTER VDiscussionAdolescence is marked as a time of exploring one’s sexual identity. This can be avery difficult process, especially for students who think they may be homosexual.Potential gay and lesbian students are socialized, as are all students, to believe that same-sex preferences are wrong and immoral. It is important to offer students who arestruggling with homosexuality many different resources that help provide accurateinformation and supportive services.The results of this study were consistent with the literature in that the selectedschools provided limited services concerning homosexuality. It seems that homophobia isalive and well in Wisconsin schools, yet resources are not available to address it. Of theeighteen Wisconsin school districts that were interviewed, only one had a Gay-StraightAlliance, four provided teacher inservices, twelve taught homosexuality units in the classcurriculum, four provided visible support, eight utilized community agencies, and fiveincorporated school themes. Twelve out of eighteen districts providing units onhomosexuality may seem appropriate. It must be taken into consideration, however, thattwo counselors “guessed” that their health classes covered homosexuality, onecounselor’s school “touched on” the topic, and another school provided a class in whichharassment (not necessarily homophobia or homosexuality) was covered.In many schools, homosexuality seems to be addressed under different categories.For example, schools believe they are covering the issue of homosexuality with classesthat cover harassment and school themes that emphasize “tolerance and respect”. Schoolsmust use caution when doing this, however. Owens (1998) reveals that “when schools25attempt to promote and respect individual diversity, the term usually applies toracial/ethnic or religious differences. Notably absent are differences in sexualorientation” (p. 2).Homosexual students and staff do indeed exist in Wisconsin schools. It isalarming, however, that many school counselors did not know a single homosexual intheir school community—including parents, teachers, students, administration, andcounselors. Some of the schools included over 1,000 students, which statisticallyindicates that one hundred of them are gay or lesbian. There may be several reasons thatcounselors were unable to identify homosexual students in their school. First, statisticsmay need to be reevaluated. Kinsey’s report that 10% of the United States population aregay or lesbian may simply be inaccurate. Second, students may not be “coming out” forfear of possible negative consequences of others knowing their sexual orientation. Inaddtition, students may not view their counselors as sources of support. This lastsuggestion supports Owens’ (1998) findings that only about 15 percent of homosexualstudents perceive their school counselors as being helpful with their problems andconcerns.Two additional ideas emerged as counselors were asked if they had anyobservations or opinions they would like to offer. First, one counselor indicated thatstudents were “pretending” to be gay in school. There were two students in the schoolwho displayed “gay characteristics”. They did not conform to their gender stereotypes.The counselor believed they did this to obtain attention from others. They did not belongto a clique at school, so the counselor believed they made themselves fit into the“homosexual clique”.  Second, counselors indicated that some adolescents are teased and26harassed not because they are gay, but because their parents, siblings, or friends are gay.This population of adolescents seems to be invisible, as there is very little researchpertaining to adolescents who have gay parents, siblings, or friends. It would bebeneficial to focus on, or include these students in future studies.School districts should consider developing systematic plans to address the topicof homosexuality. Strategies such as inservices, class curriculum, and visible support maybe incorporated to increase awareness and tolerance of the homosexual community. Itmay also be beneficial for counselors and teachers to receive in-depth educationalinformation during training.There were limitations to this study that should be mentioned. First, the samplesize of eighteen counselors was relatively small and does not allow results to begeneralized to other Wisconsin schools. Second, this study involved interviewingcounselors from public schools in Wisconsin. Private schools were not included. Last,counselors were not given time to prepare for the interviews. The researcher contactedthem and they were asked to provide instant answers. They may have overlookedvaluable information in the process.Further investigation into prevention and intervention strategies is suggested witha wider sample of districts. It may be interesting to investigate private schools as well. Inaddition, studying homophobia and prevention strategies around the country may provideto be valuable. According to Owens (1996), southern and mid-western states have morenegative attitudes toward homosexuality than the coastal states.This study aimed to assess Wisconsin school counselor’s perceptions ofhomophobia and prevention strategies in their districts. It may be useful to expand this27study to include student, parent, and administrative perceptions as well. It would beespecially interesting to determine whether a correlation exists between homophobiclevels of the school community (obtained from a Homophobia Inventory), and qualityand quantity of prevention strategies utilized in school districts.28REFERENCESBarkai, I.
