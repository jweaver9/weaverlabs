Executive SummaryNorth Carolina has large and vibrant nonprofit andphilanthropic sectors. When nonprofit organizationsand foundations partner to tackle urgent issues in thestate, they can achieve tremendous success—especiallywhen they use public policy advocacy and engage affect-ed constituencies directly in the problem-solving process.This report is the second in a series being pro-duced in regions across the country. It demonstratesthat in North Carolina, a sample of local and stateorganizations and their allies leveraged millions infoundation resources to secure almost two billiondollars in benefits for North Carolinians. Thesegroups also brought into the process thousands of res-idents such as individuals from low-wealth communi-ties; African Americans; Latinos; immigrants; NativeAmericans; farmworkers; lesbian, gay, bisexual,transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) residents; sen-ior citizens; youth; people living with HIV/AIDS andother historically disenfranchised populations. Thesemonetary impacts, as well as nonmonetary and civicengagement efforts, benefit all of North Carolina,strengthening its social fabric and helping govern-ment and the private sector serve residents and theircommunities better.NCRP studied 13 organizations that worked withunderrepresented constituencies1 in North Carolina ona range of issues, including poverty, worker issues,education, health care, housing, environment and civilrights. These organizations used a variety of strategiesto achieve change, including building coalitions,mobilizing affected communities, partnering with pol-icymakers, conducting research, reaching out to themedia, creating new institutions and employing legalstrategies. The report examined the groups’ accom-plishments over a five-year period (2003–2007):> For impacts that could be quantified, the aggregatemonetary benefit of the groups’ accomplishmentswas more than $1.8 billion.> For every dollar invested in their advocacy and organ-izing work ($20.4 million total), the groups garnered$89 in benefits for North Carolina communities.> Foundations provided critical support to these suc-cesses, contributing $17.5 million or 86 percent ofall funding for advocacy and organizing among thenonprofit sample.These numbers and equally important non-quantifiableimpacts translated into concrete improvements in peo-ple’s lives. For example, homeowners avoided losingtheir homes to foreclosure. Senior citizens gained accessto affordable medications. Low-wage workers earnedmore income and the unemployed received temporarycompensation until they could find new jobs. Studentsbenefited from supplemental education services andrenovated schools. Youth had training and summer jobopportunities. Farmworkers and other residents haddecreased exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants.Rural communities made progress in building sustain-able local economies. Same-sex partners secured theright to visit their companions in the hospital.Communities became more socially cohesive, buildingbridges across race, class and other divides.Strategic foundation support for these efforts wascentral to their success. Funders exercised leadershipin a variety of ways, both individually and collectively,to leverage their grantmaking and help nonprofitsachieve demonstrable community benefit. Theseimpacts will continue to aid North Carolina communi-ties well into the future. Yet, the state still faces manypressing challenges that require bold and continuedStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities4action. Nonprofit organizations need sustainedresources and capacity to respond effectively to thesechallenges. North Carolina grantmakers can build onthe many positive philanthropic strategies alreadyunderway in the state to achieve even more powerfulimpact. Foundations can make a measurable differ-ence; they can ally with national funders and partnerwith effective grassroots and statewide nonprofits toadvocate and organize for long-term, meaningfulchange.National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy5II. IntroductionIn 2008, the National Committee for ResponsivePhilanthropy (NCRP) produced the first in a series ofreports documenting the impacts of advocacy, commu-nity organizing and civic engagement as part of theGrantmaking for Community Impact Project (GCIP).The first report examined the work of 14 organizationsin New Mexico and found that over five years theyachieved significant impact with limited resources.Collectively, the groups achieved $2.6 billion in bene-fits for New Mexico communities and many nonmon-etary environmental, civil rights and other impacts.Detailed findings are contained in the reportStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities:Impacts of Advocacy, Organizing and CivicEngagement in New Mexico. This research wasreceived positively by funders and nonprofits in NewMexico, and its timely release bolstered the value ofnonprofit advocacy at a time when the ability to advo-cate was being challenged by state legislators.NCRP chose North Carolina as the second site forits GCIP work for numerous reasons, including itsdiverse communities, vibrant nonprofit sector, growingphilanthropic landscape and commitment by stake-holders to tackle pressing challenges. The existence ofa statewide nonprofit association eager to partner withNCRP also was an important consideration. The N.C.Center for Nonprofits has been an invaluable asset tothe project.These organizations strive to encourage nonprofitadvocacy and foundation leadership on key policyissues affecting the state. Despite their efforts and thestate’s philanthropic wealth, a sample of communityleaders found that just a handful of grantmakers in thestate consistently fund their advocacy, organizing andcivic engagement. Many nonprofits struggle to raiseenough resources to staff their advocacy work ade-quately. The goal of this report is to demonstrate howNorth Carolina grantmakers can build on their suc-cesses by partnering with communities, policymakersand national funders to meet the challenges describedbelow. Foundations can strengthen the programmaticwork they fund by also funding advocacy, which canlead to systemic changes that get to the root causes ofthese problems.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities6National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyADVOCACYAdvocacy is the act of promoting acause, idea or policy to influencepeople’s opinions or actions on mat-ters of public policy or concern.Many types of activities fall under thecategory of “advocacy” and arelegally permissible for 501(c)(3) pub-lic charities to engage in, such as:issue identification, research andanalysis; public issue education; lob-bying for or against legislation; non-partisan voter registration, educationand mobilization; litigation; educat-ing government agencies at all levels;participation in referenda and ballotinitiatives; grassroots mobilization;and testifying before government bod-ies. There are no legal limits on howmuch non-lobbying advocacy a non-profit organization can undertake.CIVIC ENGAGEMENTIn broad terms, civic engagement orcivic participation encompasses anyand all activities that engage ordi-nary people in civic life, includingthrough community organizing, advo-cacy, and voter registration, educa-tion and mobilization. It often involvesbuilding the skills, knowledge andexperience that enable people toeffectively participate in the democrat-ic process.COMMUNITY ORGANIZINGCommunity organizing is a process ofbuilding relationships, leadership andpower, typically among disenfran-chised communities, and bringing thatpower and collective voice to bear onthe issues that affect those communi-ties by engaging with relevant deci-sion-makers. The issues raised, solu-tions identified, and strategies devel-oped to achieve those solutions allare defined and acted on by theleaders themselves, usually with helpfrom professional organizers.Community organizing can be onepart of an overall advocacy or publicpolicy campaign strategy, but it is dis-tinguished by the fact that affectedconstituencies are the agents ofchange, rather than paid advocatesor lobbyists who attempt to representthe interests of such constituencies.LOBBYINGLobbying generally is defined as anattempt to influence directly or indi-rectly the passage or defeat of gov-ernment legislation. For the purposeof North Carolina rules, lobbyingalso includes attempts to influenceexecutive branch action by state gov-ernment officials and developinggoodwill with state government poli-cymakers for the purpose of influenc-ing future legislative or executiveaction. Lobbying can be one part ofan advocacy strategy, but advocacydoes not necessarily have to involvelobbying. This is a critical distinction.Federal laws determine how muchlobbying a nonprofit organizationcan undertake, but there are no limitson how much non-lobbying advocacy(described above) a nonprofit canengage in.*“MARGINALIZED” COMMUNITIESThe phrase “marginalized communi-ties” refers broadly to groups thathave been underrepresented ordenied a voice in decisions that affecttheir lives, or have experienced dis-crimination. Groups include but arenot limited to: lower-income, racialand ethnic minorities; women; immi-grants; refugees; workers; lesbian,gay, bisexual, transgender and ques-tioning (LGBTQ); disabled; rural; HIVpositive; prisoners and formerly incar-cerated; and single-parent families.NCRP seeks to increase foundationfunding for marginalized groups.Definition of Terms* Many states and municipalities have lobbying laws that do not limit how much lobbying can be done, but have registra-tion and reporting requirements, and often their own unique definitions of lobbying.

DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUNDNorth Carolina’s 100 counties comprise the state’s var-ied geography—from mountains in the west to bustlingmetropolitan areas surrounding Raleigh and Charlotte tothe tourist destination coastline. One of the ten fastestgrowing states, North Carolina grew from 8 million res-idents in 2000 to 9.2 million in 2008.2 The Triangle(Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill) and Triad (Winston-Salem and Grensboro) regions are home to some of thenation’s top educational institutions, including DukeUniversity, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill,North Carolina State University and Wake ForestUniversity. Research Triangle Park serves as a hub forsuch pharmaceutical and research corporations asGlaxoSmithKline. In the scenic western mountains,large tracts of land are federal, limiting the tax base, andrural residents living in poverty must travel far to accessservices. The coast and the mountains have attractedretirees and tourists alike, leading to economic develop-ment in these regions while highlighting their environ-mental fragility. In Charlotte, where 10 percent of jobsare finance-related, residents have benefited from thebooming banking industry until recently, but the citynow is struggling with the economic vulnerability of thatsector.3 Currently, the state faces significant challenges,including a changing population that is complicatingrace relations, a shifting economy that has left somerural communities behind, and a highly-touted publiceducation system that must respond to racial disparitiesand new economic realities.Much of the population increase can be attributedto the Latino population, which nearly quadrupledbetween 1990 and 2000, and grew again by nearly600 percent from 2000 to 2008.4 While this growthmay have slowed because of stepped up raids anddeportations, immigration remains a highly contestedpolicy issue at the state level. Further, the shiftingdemographics of the state have turned the traditionalwhite-black dynamic of race relations to white-black-brown. One positive outcome of this change is anincrease in multiracial organizations that seek to buildrelationships between traditionally disparate groups,such as rural blacks and Latino migrant farmworkers.North Carolina has the largest Native Americanpopulation among East Coast states. The Lumbee tribeis the most populous, followed by the Eastern Band ofCherokee Indians (EBCI), half of whom live on theQualla Boundary land trust in the southwest corner ofthe state. Robeson County has a high concentration ofLumbee and Tuscarora Indians, who account for 37percent of the population there.5North Carolina’s geographic diversity mirrors eco-nomic differences; the disparity between urban andrural counties is striking. According to the N.C. RuralEconomic Development Center, the state’s populationis approximately split between urban and ruralregions, yet persistent poverty exists at especially highlevels in rural areas. The richest 20 percent of NorthCarolinians earn 50.1 percent of the state’s income andbenefits, while the poorest 20 percent earn just 3.4percent.6 Of the 23 counties with poverty rates greaterthan 18 percent, 19 are in the Coastal Plain region.7B. THE CHANGING ECONOMYAs in many states, North Carolina’s economy has shift-ed away from manufacturing in the past decade.However, the state remains a stronghold for industrialfarming. North Carolina’s industrial hog operation hasgrown to include more than 10 million hogs in 2007,making it the second-largest pork producer in theStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities8country.8 Located disproportionately in poor ruralcommunities of color, industrial farming introduceseconomic and public health problems while under-resourced rural counties struggle to cope. Issues suchas migrant housing quality and farmworker exposureto pesticides also primarily affect rural areas.North Carolina is the least unionized state in thecountry; only about 4 percent of workers belong to aunion.9 The state’s limited and tumultuous labor organ-izing history adds to the challenges of worker organiz-ing today, making a recent victory by Smithfield work-ers all the more significant. After a 16-year campaignand two previously failed votes, workers at the hogplant voted to unionize. Unity between the AfricanAmerican and Latino members of the workforce wascited as key to the victory.10 Yet, labor organizingremains a challenge in the state, where public sectorunions do not have the right to bargain collectively.As the economy of the state is shifting, the numberof residents without health insurance has grown steadi-ly, increasing by 17 percent from 2006 to 2007, when17.9 percent of the population lacked health coverage.This is especially the case for non-white residents;Latinos have the highest rate with 52.6 percent beinguninsured. Further, more than 34 rural counties haveuninsured rates greater than 20 percent.11Today, a North Carolinian has a hard time earning aliving wage with a high school diploma. The changingeconomy has led to the need for a more educated andbetter-prepared workforce. The sectors traditionallyassociated with rural North Carolina jobs, such astobacco, manufacturing, textiles and furniture all havecontracted in recent years:> Between 1990 and 2002, rural areas saw a 27 per-cent decline in manufacturing jobs; 60,000 manu-facturing jobs were lost in rural counties between2000 and 2003 alone.12> Between 1999 and 2007, median householdincome in the state declined by 8.2 percent afteradjusting for inflation – from $48,766 to $44,772.13> In 2000, 37 percent of urban residents held associ-ate’s or higher degrees, compared with just 22 per-cent of rural residents in the state.14National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyORGANIZATION AND MAP LOCATION REACH1.

In the 2008 Presidentialelection, the state’s voter turnout rose dramatically. Acoalition of organizations led by NC Fair Share andDemocracy North Carolina won changes to electorallaws that allowed one-stop voter registration and vot-ing for 17 days prior to the election. These organiza-tions and others, including Blueprint NC, NC NAACPand the state affiliate of Common Cause, engaged innonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts. North Carolinaexperienced an increase in voter turnout to 70 percentin 2008 (compared with 64 percent in 2004 and 59percent in 2000).15 Further, the fact that a Democraticpresidential candidate won the state’s electoral votesrepresents a major political shift. The extent to whichthis increased citizen participation and political shiftwill affect policy at the state and local levels remainsto be seen.C. NONPROFIT AND PHILANTHROPICLANDSCAPENorth Carolina has a vibrant nonprofit sector with astrong state association—the N.C. Center forNonprofits. The sector accounts for 10 percent ofjobs and contributes $29 billion to the state’s econo-my annually, a figure that has more than doubledover the past decade. The nonprofit sector is thefastest growing employment sector in the state,increasing by 14 percent a year over the past decade.Yet, the majority (52 percent) of nonprofit jobs is inthe Triangle and Triad regions.16 Nonprofit capacityoutside of this area may be underdeveloped, espe-cially for groups that use advocacy and communityorganizing to achieve change. In the western moun-tains, nonprofits and foundations have collaboratedeffectively to serve the region. Some of the smallercities in eastern North Carolina have nonprofits withadvocacy capacity, but many organizations in therural east have little or no paid staff and rely heavilyon volunteers, increasing their impact when possibleby partnering with stronger regional and statewideorganizations. Additional strains brought on by thecurrent economic crisis have diminished the capaci-ty and resources of the whole sector. “Advocacy isparticularly important during an economic recessionwhen nonprofits are being called on to provide evenmore services,” noted David Heinen, director ofpublic policy and advocacy at N.C. Center forNonprofits. “Nonprofits understand the needs of thepeople and communities they serve, and they can bepowerful voices for their constituencies in thesetimes of greatest need.”Over the past decade, the number of philanthropicfoundations in North Carolina has more than tripled,from 793 in 1997 to 2,834 in 2006. Private founda-tions have accounted for much of this growth, number-ing only 686 in 1997 but increasing to 2,630 by 2006.Accordingly, private foundation assets have nearlydoubled since 1997, from $6.96 billion to $13.09 bil-lion in 2006. Institutional giving has more thanquadrupled, from $318 million in grants in 1997 to$1.3 billion in 2006. This growth has made NorthCarolina the 14th largest state by foundation assets andthe ninth largest state for giving.17 If North Carolinamirrors national trends, it is likely that foundationassets have declined more recently; still there is a richphilanthropic community within the state. The non-profits interviewed for this report indicated that only asmall number of foundations in the area provide con-sistent support for advocacy and organizing, but thosethat do offer positive examples for their peers. In meet-ing the state’s challenges, funders and nonprofits havemuch success on which to build. As this report demon-strates, nonprofits engaged in advocacy, organizingand civic engagement at all levels can achieve signifi-cant impact in partnership with philanthropy.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities10National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy11IV. Brief Summary of ResearchApproachNCRP used a methodology developed specifical-ly for the Grantmaking for Community ImpactProject to measure the impacts of advocacy, organ-izing and civic engagement among a sample of 13organizations in North Carolina over a five-yeartimeframe from 2003–2007.18First, NCRP identified potential community organi-zations to be researched in the state by gathering sug-gestions from nonprofit, foundation and other commu-nity leaders. After a complete list was generated,19NCRP considered organizations that have been in exis-tence for at least five years; have at least one full-timestaff person or equivalent devoted to advocacy ororganizing; focus on a core constituency of lower-income people, people of color or other marginalizedgroups, broadly defined; work on a local, regional(within-state) or statewide level; and have the capacityto provide data for the research. Through this process,NCRP research staff developed a sample that reflectsthe diverse regions and constituencies in the state, abroad range of issues and a mix of organizationalapproaches. Thirteen organizations participated:> Center for Community Action> Center for Participatory Change> Communities Helping All Neighbors GainEmpowerment (CHANGE)> Concerned Citizens of Tillery> Durham CAN> Equality North Carolina> Helping Empower Local People (HELP)> NC Housing Coalition> NC Justice Center> Neighbors for Better Neighborhoods> Senior PharmAssist> Student Action with Farmworkers> Toxic Free North CarolinaA brief description of each organization and contactinformation is included in Appendix A. Many otherorganizations engaging in advocacy, organizing andcivic engagement throughout the state have met theresearch criteria and achieved significant impacts aswell. This report is intended to be illustrative ratherthan exhaustive in its scope.NCRP researchers collected data from all 13 organ-izations by interviewing senior staff from each group inperson and then collecting written responses to adetailed questionnaire. Several organizations also pro-vided supplemental materials, such as news clippings,brochures, campaign materials, budgets and grantreports. NCRP gathered data from the five-year periodof 2003–2007 for the following measures:> Advocacy and organizing impacts.Where possible,groups included the dollar value of policy changes(e.g., income gained through minimum wageincrease, increased state funds for a health program,school district cost savings due to less costly pestmanagement) and the number of constituents bene-fiting from the changes, as well as strategies andfactors contributing to success.> Civic engagement indicators. For example, thenumber of leaders trained and people mobilized tocommunicate with policymakers.> Interim progress and capacity-building indicators.For example, changes in leaders’ skills and accessto the policy process.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities12> Amounts and types of funding the groups receivedfor advocacy, organizing and civic engagement dur-ing the five years, examples of positive funder part-nerships and obstacles they faced in seeking funding.NCRP research staff verified the impacts to ensurethat the dollar amounts and number of beneficiariesestimated by groups, as well as the groups’ role in thewins, were accurate. This was done by consulting withpublic officials, researchers and other experts, as wellas examining source materials such as newspaper arti-cles and state budget documents.20 These data wereaggregated to determine the total monetary benefits ofall the wins; for ongoing impacts (such as recurringappropriations or benefits), the value was calculatedthrough 2010. Financial data were aggregated to deter-mine the total amount invested by foundations andother sources to support advocacy and organizingacross the groups. A return on investment (ROI) calcu-lation was made using the following formula:The ROI shows how collective financial support bygrantmakers and other funding sources for a set oforganizing and advocacy groups in a location overtime has contributed to the collective policy impacts ofthese groups. It would be almost impossible to demon-strate that a specific grant caused a specific impact, oreven that one group alone was responsible for a poli-cy change. The use of an aggregate ROI helps focus thefindings on the investment that all of the organizationsand their supporters together have made that con-tributed to success. The ROI is not intended to be aprecise figure but provides a solid basis for understand-ing the extent of substantial benefit for communities inNorth Carolina from investments in nonprofits that useadvocacy and organizing to achieve long-term, sys-temic change. It does not capture every input that con-tributed to these successes. For example, there weremany coalition efforts in which groups not featured inthis report participated, and their financial informationis not reflected in the ROI. However, for the impactsthat are included, one or more of the 13 sample groupsplayed a significant or lead role in achieving the victo-ry. Yet, a large proportion of the impacts were notquantifiable, making the ROI an underestimate of thebenefits actually achieved.National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyaggregate dollar amount of all winsaggregate dollars invested in advocacy and organizingROI =13V. FindingsA. RETURN ON INVESTMENT ANDAGGREGATE BENEFITSThe research shows that nonprofits engaged in advo-cacy, organizing and civic engagement have con-tributed significant benefits to North Carolina com-munities. NCRP identified at least 45 separateimpacts, of which 30 were quantifiable in terms ofdollar benefit. These impacts directly benefit tens ofthousands of workers, families, public school stu-dents, senior citizens, rural communities, LGBTQ res-idents and other historically underrepresentedgroups. Major impacts were found across numerousissues, including poverty, living wages, housing, eco-nomic development, environmental justice, healthcare, education and civil rights.Overall, the numbers show that:> The total amount spent on advocacy and organizingacross the 13 groups from 2003 to 2007 was$20,365,023.> Of that amount, $17,504,542 was contributed byfoundations, comprising 86 percent of all supportfor advocacy and organizing.> The total dollar amount of quantifiable benefitsachieved during the five-year period was$1,808,316,547.> The return on investment, which is total dollar valueof impacts divided by total spent for advocacy andorganizing, is $89.Thus, for every dollar invested in the advocacy,organizing and civic engagement activities of 13groups collectively, there was $89 in benefits to NorthCarolina communities.Many significant impacts simply could not be quanti-fied, making this ROI a conservative figure. For exam-ple, it is impossible to quantify the benefit of advancedcivil rights for a particular constituency or the healthcosts saved by staving off future industrial hog opera-tions. Also, several impacts were defensive in nature,and they resulted in no change to the status quo. Yet, ifthese preventive efforts had failed, constituencieswould have been harmed by the resulting changes—harms that could not be quantified easily. Finally, mostof the groups are in the midst of long-term efforts thatstill are being fought. They may have had partial victo-ries and made interim progress in measurable ways. Theinvestments made by foundations between 2003 and2007 will reap future rewards that cannot be quantifiedat present. If more foundations invest resources in advo-cacy, organizing and civic engagement, the benefits toNorth Carolinians no doubt will be even greater.B. IMPACT HIGHLIGHTS BY ISSUEThe 13 featured organizations focused their advocacyand organizing efforts on a range of problems andchallenges at the local and state levels. The groupssought long-term, creative solutions that would pro-vide lasting improvements for their constituencies andthe broader public. Following are just some of thehighlights of these successful efforts. Appendices B andC summarize all of the victories the sample groupsachieved.1. Economic SecurityAdvocacy and organizing groups across the state workedto reduce poverty, provide protections for homeowners,improve substandard housing and strengthen the safetynet for tens of thousands of working families.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities14Living Wages – At the state level, the North Caroliniansfor Fair Wages (NCFW) coalition, led by the NC JusticeCenter, won an increase in the state’s minimum wage in2006, from $5.15 per hour to $6.15 per hour. It is esti-mated that 139,000 workers across the state benefitedfrom this wage increase, resulting in $1,500 in addi-tional income annually for a total impact of $208.5 mil-lion per year. Business interests have powerful sway inthe North Carolina legislature. Nonetheless, NCFWsuccessfully built a broad, statewide coalition that drewon a previous successful state minimum wage increasein Florida, widespread popular support for the measureand the support of prominent political figures such asformer Senator John Edwards and State TreasurerRichard Moore. State minimum wage campaigns, par-ticularly in states perceived to be hostile to suchchanges, helped build momentum for the federal mini-mum wage increase enacted in 2007. The new federalminimum, which will rise to $7.25 in July 2009, is esti-mated to benefit 12.5 million workers nationally,including many North Carolinians.21Durham County advocates have achieved livingwage policies at the city and county levels as well asat Durham Public Schools (DPS) and Duke University.DurhamCAN was instrumental in this campaign,building political capital with its city living wage cam-paign in 2004 before moving on to the county and thelarge institutions of DPS and Duke. At Duke,DurhamCAN engaged students in its campaign, build-ing popular support for the administrative change. Thechanges at the city, county and public schools haveresulted in at least $1.3 million in additional incomefor an estimated 100 workers since 2004, and thewages are indexed to inflation. At Duke, up to 95workers have benefited from a wage increase to $10per hour, and now 30 additional workers have employ-er-sponsored health benefits. The combined wages andbenefits that have accrued since 2007 are worth hun-dreds of thousands of dollars.Worker Credits and Benefits – During the 2001–2003recession, a time when the state had one of the high-est unemployment rates in the country, the NorthCarolina Alliance for Modernization of UnemploymentInsurance worked to secure passage of comprehensiveunemployment insurance reform. Now, thousands ofNorth Carolinians who previously were excluded canclaim unemployment benefits. As one of the few statesmeeting the requirements for the UnemploymentInsurance Modernization Act that is part of theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,North Carolina will receive more than $200 million inadditional federal funding for unemployment insur-ance. The statewide coalition, led by the NC JusticeCenter, comprised 20 organizations across the staterepresenting a variety of constituencies. In June 2003,the alliance won unemployment insurance reform thatincluded extended benefits, shorter waiting periodsand the expansion of benefits to new groups of part-time workers. These changes have resulted in an esti-mated $30.2 million in additional unemployment ben-efits for approximately 6,000 workers. The allianceworked with the Employment Security Commission—the state agency administering unemployment insur-ance—to ensure that it added unemployment insur-ance reform to its legislative agenda, resulting in sup-port from key legislators and ultimately leading to thepassage of the reform.Building on the previous success of NorthCarolinians for a Fair Wage, in 2007 the NC JusticeCenter led a broad coalition to enact a state EarnedIncome Tax Credit (EITC). Then-Lieutenant GovernorBeverly Perdue and the state treasurer supported thecoalition’s proposal, which helped build support forthe passage of a 3 percent fully refundable EITC in2007 despite gubernatorial opposition. Furtherwork increased the rate to 5 percent, resulting in taxsavings and refunds of $49 million in 2008 and $69million in 2009 for 845,000 lower-income workersin the state.Economic Development – Advocacy and organizinggroups in the state have worked with local govern-ments to develop youth workforce skills and provideNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyThe Living Income Standard shows that on average statewide, it costs overtwice as much to live in North Carolina than indicated by the Federal PovertyLevel (2003).15employment. In Charlotte, Helping Empower LocalPeople (HELP) reinvigorated the waning Mayor’s YouthEmployment Program in 2007, which trained 1,500youth and placed 273 in local jobs. HELP worked withits member congregations and Councilman JohnLassiter to leverage $711,000 from the City ofCharlotte and private industry in the first year of theprogram. In Winston-Salem, CHANGE and Neighborsfor Better Neighborhoods organized to provide sum-mer jobs for teens in 2004. More than 40 congrega-tions participated in the campaign, turning out morethan 1,000 people at a public hearing to tell city lead-ers about the difficulty their children had finding sum-mer employment. Since 2004, more than $225,000has been contributed to the city summer jobs program,employing 125–175 teens annually.Between 2003 and 2007, the Center forParticipatory Change (CPC) in Asheville worked tobuild community capacity for agriculture and worker-owned cooperatives. This community-based agriculturecampaign partnered with five grassroots groups andnetworks across 25 Appalachian counties to developleadership and build agricultural capacity. This resultedin greater self-reliance in rural Appalachian countiesand an income stream for rural workers. The worker-ownership campaign strengthened four immigrantworker-owned cooperatives in western North Carolina.The cooperatives have provided jobs for about 25immigrants in house cleaning, tortilla and salsa making,and sewing. Through 2009 the projects will have pro-vided at least $100,000 and possibly as much as$300,000 in income for the cooperatives.Affordable Housing – Several years ago, Campaign forHousing Carolina, with leadership from the NC JusticeCenter and North Carolina Housing Coalition, beganadvocating for a $50 million investment in the stateHousing Trust Fund (HTF). The original HTF was creat-ed in 1988 using funds from the Oil Overcharge Act.By 2008, the campaign won a total of $51.2 million forthe fund in recurring and nonrecurring appropriations.More than 6,000 families in the state have benefitedfrom affordable housing built as a result. According tothe North Carolina Housing Finance Agency, the rippleeffect of these recent appropriations includes $232million of new construction and housing rehabilita-tion, $17.5 million in state tax revenues and $26.3 mil-lion in local tax revenues. The North Carolina HousingCoalition built on the momentum of this campaign tojoin advocates for a National Housing Trust Fund at thefederal level, which was created in 2008.By 2004, manufacturing plant layoffs were con-tributing to an increase in foreclosures around thestate; the foreclosure rate tripled between 1998 and2003. The NC Housing Coalition worked with the NCJustice Center to introduce the Home ProtectionProgram, modeled after a successful program inPennsylvania and operated through the state’s HousingFinance Agency. The program provides one-time assis-tance or up to 18 months of mortgage assistance tohomeowners who have lost their jobs through no faultof their own. In its pilot year, the program served 13counties; by 2008, all 100 counties were eligible witha recurring state appropriation for the program. Theprogram has given more than $4.15 million in loanssince 2005; the estimated value of saved property is$49 million. The program has assisted 394 homeown-ers and counseled more than 4,000 households. Thebroader impact of the program has been an increase inneighborhood stability and property values due toforeclosure prevention. “I don’t think [HPP] wouldhave happened without NCHC and NCJC,” notedTrisch Amend, director of Policy, Planning &Technology, North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.“It went from being a one-time, non-recurring appro-priation of $1.7 million to a recurring appropriation of$3 million, which has allowed the program to serve theentire state.”In 2006, the Center for Participatory Change andthe Community Reinvestment Association of NorthCarolina (CRANC) organized residents of a mobilehome park in Burnsville to convert their trailer parkinto a Community Land Trust—the first in the state todo so. CPC and CRANC worked with the 14 low-wealth families in the park, who joined with localcommunity members to form the Burnsville LandCommunity, to build the group’s leadership and capac-ity, resulting in the community purchasing the land for$300,000. In 2008, the NC Housing Coalitionacquired funding to provide technical support toensure that this work would continue and that BLCwould become a sustainable land trust community.Neighbors for Better Neighborhoods (NBN) inWinston-Salem has worked with many tenant groups toadvocate for improved living conditions. For more thana decade, residents of Forest Ridge Apartments haddealt with poor plumbing, infestations of rats and cock-roaches, no heat, mold and high utility bills. NBN andCHANGE helped residents organize for repairs andsecure better housing through federal Section 8 vouch-Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunitiesers. NBN also helped residents build their assets byconnecting them to individual development accounts(IDAs). Forest Ridge now is under new management. Inthe Lakeside neighborhood ofWinston-Salem, residentsendured substandard conditions, and multiple cases oflead poisoning in children had been reported. In 2005,residents approached NBN to request help in bringingtheir concerns to public officials. NBN partnered withCHANGE and Legal Aid to bring the mayor of Winston-Salem, Councilperson Jocelyn Johnson and other cityofficials on a tour of the neighborhood to meet tenantsand view the living conditions. After the tour ofLakeside, the mayor agreed to form a task force toaddress the substandard housing. The task force sam-pled a quarter of the apartments in the neighborhood todocument conditions; most units failed the inspections.Following NBN’s work in Forest Ridge and Lakesideand the formation of the mayor’s task force, a minimumhousing code committee was formed inWinston-Salemto push for legislative changes.2. Environmental JusticeNorth Carolina is a large agricultural state and anincreasingly industrialized one. Today, it is the sec-ond-largest pork producer in the country; yet, thepotential economic benefits of industrial farmingdevelopment are overshadowed by environmentaljustice challenges for groups seeking to protect ruralhealth and living standards.Protecting Rural Residents – For several years, com-munity groups such as Concerned Citizens of Tillery,which led the North Carolina Environmental JusticeNetwork (NCEJN), advocated for a permanentstatewide ban on lagoon and sprayfield technology.Intensive livestock operations, or ILOs, have taken theplace of small family farms and produce large amountsof waste. Previous CCT and UNC-Chapel Hill researchfound that ILOs are located disproportionately inlower-income communities and communities of color,even when controlling for population density. ILOsalso are located in areas where residents depend pri-marily on wells for drinking water. In 2007, NCEJNand a broad statewide coalition took the communities’case to the state capitol, where advocates held a 51-hour vigil and constructed a mock hog factory, includ-ing 40 gallons of pig waste. Other organizations activeon this issue included the Southern Environmental LawCenter (SELC), Sierra Club and Environmental DefenseFund. After a temporary moratorium, the state bannedany new or expanded lagoons or sprayfields, althoughcurrent ILOs are allowed to keep existing open-airlagoons indefinitely. The law also encouraged the useof alternative waste disposal methods through a costsharing program.22 Nearly one million rural residentswill benefit from cleaner air and water as a result of therestrictions.Concerned Citizens of Tillery worked with a broadcoalition of other citizen groups in 2006 to advocatefor a moratorium on the development of landfills inthe state. Landfill development was being billed aseconomic development; North Carolina localitiesintended to import trash from other states such as NewYork and New Jersey. CCT and its partners worked toshow lawmakers the negative impacts that landfillshave on the surrounding community and to drawattention to the fact that they often are placed inalready low-resource areas. The state passed a one-year moratorium on landfill development in July 2006,giving advocates time to educate local counties aboutthe downside of landfills. This moratorium preventedNorth Carolina from becoming the fourth largest land-fill state in the country.Toxics and Public Safety – In 2003, DurhamCANworked with Durham Public Schools and theDepartment of Health to secure funding for lead testing16National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyThe Housing Trust Fund is the state’s most flexible resource for housing for suc-cessful entry-level home ownership.

Their efforts resulted in at least $2 million infederal grants to the Durham Department of Health,money that would have been returned hadDurhamCAN not worked to identify target homes in thecity and demonstrate the need for testing. Through theresulting partnership between Durham Public Schoolsand the Department of Health, more than 2,000school-age children had their homes tested for lead.In the McDougald Terrace public housing develop-ment of Durham, Brenntag chemical company waspolluting a stream running through the neighborhood.The smell and environmental threat were affecting res-idents adversely, and DurhamCAN helped the neigh-borhood council work with local decision makers tocompel the company to change its practices. Theseefforts resulted in more than $1 million in voluntaryrepairs by the company and benefited 350 families inthe neighborhood.In 2004, Toxic Free NC began its campaign to con-vince the public schools in Durham and OrangeCounties to adopt integrated pest management (IPM)—a common-sense method of pest management thatreduces children's exposures to toxic pesticideresidues in school buildings dramatically. Toxic FreeNC worked with parents and teachers to mobilize andeducate school leaders about safety issues associatedwith spraying for pests. Since adopting an IPM policyin 2005, Durham and Orange Public Schools havesaved $103,200. Toxic Free NC built on this successand in 2006 helped pass the state School Children’sHealth Act, which requires IPM and pesticide notifica-tion in all North Carolina public schools by 2011.When implemented fully, it is estimated that IPM willsave $420,500 annually and benefit 1.45 millionschool children.In 2003, Toxic Free NC helped defeat a rollback ofaerial spray regulations in the state. Crop dusters thatwere required to keep chemicals off homes, schools,businesses and roadways by maintaining a buffer zonewhen spraying would have been allowed to eliminatethat buffer zone. Along with Student Action withFarmworkers and other partners, Toxic Free NCdemonstrated the negative health and safety impactssuch a rollback would bring, including increasedemergency room costs for rural residents. In 2006,Toxic Free NC joined with the Farmworker AdvocacyNetwork to press the state’s Commission for HealthServices to adopt a rule requiring health care providersto report suspected pesticide-related illness and injury.With broad support from health care providers, therule passed; prior to this, North Carolina was the onlylarge agricultural state without a pesticide illness andinjury surveillance program. Now, the NC Division ofPublic Health has a recurring $76,000 grant to retainan epidemiologist and a one-time grant of $50,000 toconduct health provider training.3. Civil and Human RightsMany advocacy and organizing efforts have compelledthe state to expand and uphold civil rights. While otherwins highlighted in this report have implications forconstituency rights and racial equity, this sectionfocuses specifically on LGBTQ, farmworker and immi-grant rights.Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning(LGBTQ) Individuals – Equality NC successfully peti-tioned the state Medical Care Commission in 2007 forpassage of a law that provides same-sex partners withbasic visitation rights as part of the North CarolinaPatients Bill of Rights for all hospitals in the state. Thestate does not recognize same-sex couples, but the Billof Rights grants an estimated 16,000 same-sex couplesthe same hospital visitation rights that married couplesenjoy. The rights also apply to all unmarried couplesand caregivers—a great example of the universal ben-efits that can be gained through targeted policies.In 2007, Equality NC ensured that the SchoolViolence Prevention Act, which provided stronger pro-tections against bullying and harassment for all 1.45million public school students, included LGBTQ lan-guage. This marked the first time that either chamber ofthe state legislature passed a bill that included protec-tions based on sexual orientation and gender identity.The bill has passed the House, and advocates now areworking to secure full passage of the law.Every year since 2004, Equality NC has prevented astate constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, civilunion or any other kind of same-sex relationship recog-nition. Such a ban even could prevent private compa-nies from providing partner benefits. At the time of thisreport’s completion, North Carolina was the only statein the South without such a constitutional ban.Farmworkers – The Farmworker Advocacy Network, acoalition coordinated by Student Action withFarmworkers (members include Alianza-UNC, EastCoast Migrant Head Start Project, El Pueblo, EpiscopalFarmworker Ministry, Farm Labor OrganizingCommittee, Farmworker National Farm WorkerStrengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesMinistry, NC Community Health Center Association,NC Farmworkers Project, NC Justice Center, Toxic FreeNC and the Western NC Workers Center) worked topass amendments to the NC Migrant Housing Act in2007. Among other changes, the amendments requirethat employers provide clean and sanitary mattresseson all beds and provide alternative housing when thegiven housing is determined uninhabitable. The lawalso called on the NC Housing Finance Agency to con-duct a feasibility study on low-cost financing for theconstruction and rehabilitation of migrant housing. Thebill further provided $124,000 in recurring annualfunding for two additional migrant housing inspectors.The Farmworker Advocacy Network continues to workwith the Department of Labor to discuss implementa-tion of the changes, which benefit at least 100,000migrant farmworkers in the state.In 2007, the Farmworker Advocacy Network workedwith state legislators to introduce the AgriculturalFamily Protection Act in response to the Ag-Mart case,in which the Department of Agriculture litigated againstthe company as the largest pesticide law violator instate history. While the state was unable to uphold itscase against Ag-Mart—the court ruled that only six of200 alleged worker safety violations could be proven—the case nonetheless drew attention to farmworkerhealth and safety issues.23 The Governor’s Task Forceadded provisions of the bill to its recommendations andthe Agricultural Family Protection Act passed in 2008.It prevents retaliation against farmworkers reportingpesticide violations and requires employers to maintainaccurate pesticide application records, ensure ade-18National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyThe Latino population in NorthCarolina quadrupled between 1990and 2000, and continued to skyrocketthrough 2008. One estimate is thatclose to half of the state’s 650,000Latino residents are undocumented.24The state’s changing demographicshave led to increased tension betweenresidents and newcomers. Many non-profit groups have worked to improveconditions for immigrants in the stateand build bridges with other con-stituencies. El Pueblo has been in theforefront of statewide advocacy andcollective action on Latino issues.Initially led by Andrea Bazán, whonow heads Triangle CommunityFoundation, El Pueblo developed thefirst Latino Legislative Agenda,advancing education, health, housingand worker rights. The organizationcontinues to advocate for immigrantrights under current Executive DirectorAntonio Asión. El Pueblo and twoother leading groups, NC JusticeCenter and NC Latino Coalition,recently formalized their collaborationto increase the effectiveness of advo-cacy and organizing efforts statewideand develop a unified immigrantrights agenda. The newly-createdNorth Carolina Immigrants United hasbeen able to assist immigrants in cri-sis, increase civic engagement andrespond to legal and policy issuesmore comprehensively. ReflectedAsión, \"The most difficult part of myjob is trying to get the citizens ofNorth Carolina to understand thatLatinos, documented and non-docu-mented alike, only want to see thestate succeed and are willing to helpin good times and bad.\"One key policy agenda item forimmigrant rights advocates has beeneducation. The statewide AdelanteEducation Coalition was formed toadvocate for access to higher educa-tion for undocumented immigrants.Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF)and Adelante members (Blue RibbonMentor-Advocate Program, Center forParticipatory Change, Coalition forCollege Access [C4CA], El Pueblo,NC Latino Coalition, NC JusticeCenter and NC Society of HispanicProfessionals) worked with legislatorsto introduce bills in 2003 and 2005that would have allowed undocument-ed immigrants to pay in-state tuition atpublic universities. SAF coordinatedAdelante and mobilized thousands ofstudents, parents and educators toraise awareness and call on NorthCarolina community colleges to createa uniform policy of enrolling undocu-mented students. This policy subse-quently was overturned, and communi-ty colleges now are prohibited by lawIN FOCUS: La Lucha ContinuaThe Immigrant Rights Struggle ContinuesMama y niña: A mother and daughter areamong the 4,500 people standing up for immi-grant rights at the We Are One America march inAsheville NC on May 1, 2006.

HealthHealth care is a major concern for foundations andadvocates, who have sought to improve service deliv-ery and increase access for residents without cover-age. As the state and federal governments grapplewith major reform questions, North Carolina organi-zations have succeeded in strengthening existing pro-grams and developing new ones. Services for theuninsured, funding for HIV/AIDS prevention andtreatment, and safer schools for hundreds of thou-sands of school children due to changes in pesticideuse are a few of the outcomes of recent advocacy andorganizing efforts.Services for the uninsured and underinsured – Forlower-income residents of Durham, specialty healthservices were an inaccessible luxury. Beginning in2006, DurhamCAN worked with Duke Medical Centerto coordinate and provide specialty services for resi-dents who otherwise would turn to the emergencyroom for their needs beyond primary care. To date,Duke Medical has provided $1 million in specialtyservices for 1,400 lower-income residents. Whenimplemented fully, the program will provide upwardsof $3 million in specialty services annually.In Winston-Salem in 2005, the Downtown HealthPlaza that provided free and reduced-cost services tolower-income and uninsured residents was in dangerof losing its funding. CHANGE helped turn out morethan 150 people at a Forsyth County CommissionersStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunitiesfrom admitting undocumented students.Yet, advocates felt strongly that the pre-vious situation, in which individual col-leges determined their own admissionspolicies, was unfair to immigrant stu-dents. They sought a universal admis-sions policy. A preliminary study onthe impact of admitting undocumentedimmigrants to state schools, commis-sioned by the State Board ofCommunity Colleges, found a netfinancial benefit to schools if undocu-mented immigrants were admitted andcharged out-of-state tuition.25 Adelantehas continued advocating on this issuein the legislature and supporting thework of C4CA, a self-organized coali-tion of college students teaching andmobilizing their peers to support immi-grant access to higher education.The Center for ParticipatoryChange, a member of Adelante, alsoengaged in local immigrant rightsorganizing during the study period. Inaddition to speaking out on access tohigher education, the organizationpartnered with the Coalición deOrganizaciones Latino-Americanas(COLA), 20 western North CarolinaLatino-led organizations and fivestatewide organizations on Title VIenforcement, Immigration and CustomsEnforcement (ICE) raids and compre-hensive immigration reform. Thesecampaigns built the leadership andcapacity of local Latino-led organiza-tions, many of which have workedwith public agencies to improve immi-grant access to programs and enhancetranslation and interpretation services.CPC also has worked to raiseawareness about the ways in whichanti-immigrant policies, such as locallaw-enforcement lending its resourcesto ICE, have a negative impact oncommunities. In its newsletter MountainViews, CPC profiled a local womanarrested in an ICE raid. Juanita, whowas separated from her husband andchildren, told CPC, “[Raids] destroyfamilies and create fear. They makepeople fearful; they produce racism,they make doors close for you every-where. Now we can’t have licenses ora dignified job. …We are all humanbeings; we are equal, regardless ofbeing from a different country.” CPCand COLA have educated non-immi-grants about immigrant issues through-out western North Carolina. Thisbridge building has paid off by broad-ening the base of the immigrant rightsmovement and has helped localchurches advocate more effectively onimmigrant issues. Following the raid inAugust 2008, CPC helped coordinatea protest and prayer vigil attended by350 community members.Many advocacy and organizinggroups position immigrant rights in thecontext of human rights, but NorthCarolina policy experts have suggest-ed shifting the immigrant rights discus-sion to overcome anti-immigrant senti-ment. Mac McCorkle, a political advi-sor to numerous candidates and elect-ed officials in the state, told HELPretreat attendees in January that advo-cates must reframe the issue of immi-grant rights. Immigrants are “taxpay-ers, workers and families” that con-tribute to society just like everyoneelse. Immigrant rights organizationshave laid important groundwork forachieving change that will benefitthese taxpayers, workers and familiesin coming years.20meeting at which the commissioners then voted tomaintain $1.5 million in county funding for theDowntown Health Plaza. CHANGE continues its workto protect funding for the Plaza.HIV/AIDS Prevention and Treatment – Between 2005and 2008, Equality NC helped create the NC AIDSAction Network, which worked to increase resourcesfor HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in the state. In2006, the network secured legislation expandingaccess to the federal AIDS Drug Assistance Program(ADAP). Previously, North Carolina had the lowest eli-gibility level in the country for the ADAP; now it is atthe national standard. In 2007, the network won a $2million increase in annual state funding for HIV pre-vention programs, the first such increase in a decade.In Charlotte, HELP engaged African American cler-gy to organize for greater awareness of MecklenburgCounty’s rapidly increasing HIV/AIDS infection rate.The county has the fastest growing rate of infection inthe state, and 69 percent of new cases in Charlotte areamong the black population.26 In 2008, these effortsyielded a $365,000 federal commitment for support ofHIV/AIDS testing, education, prevention and treat-ment. HELP is working with its congressional delega-tion to ensure that the commitment is honored.Senior Citizens – Following the passage of MedicarePart D, Senior PharmAssist played a leadership role increating the statewide coalition Advocates for a NorthCarolina Prescription Drug Assistance Program. Theadvocates organized for the creation of NCRx, whichprovides Medicare D monthly premium assistance tolower-income seniors in the state. In 2006, then-Governor Michael Easley allocated $24 million over 30months to the newly created NCRx program; given stricteligibility criteria and competing priorities, less than $6million has been used for NCRx. Then-LieutenantGovernor Perdue announced an additional $2 millionfor ChecKmeds—a pharmaceutical reimbursement pro-gram for medication therapy management services.NCRx has helped 5,325 lower-income seniors andChecKmeds has meant partial reimbursement for phar-macists providing medication therapy management tomore than 17,000 seniors in North Carolina.In response to Medicare Part D and the complica-tions it introduced for beneficiaries and agenciesassisting seniors, Senior PharmAssist and the advocateshelped introduce legislative funding for the Seniors’Health Insurance Information Program (SHIIP) out-reach grants. This measure provided $250,000 in com-munity-based grants statewide to connect 15,000 eli-gible seniors to services such as NCRx and federal PartD subsidies.Toxics and Public Safety – As described in theEnvironmental Justice section (see page 17), the healthbenefits for constituencies from reduced exposure totoxic lead, chemicals and pesticides are highly signifi-cant even if difficult to quantify.5. EducationIncreased resources for renovating and replacing run-down school buildings and millions of dollars of fund-ing for disadvantaged and struggling students resultedfrom advocacy and organizing efforts in the state.These changes have improved opportunity and learn-ing environments for tens of thousands of publicschool students.Legal Precedent – In 2004, the North CarolinaSupreme Court unanimously upheld the 2002 decisionof Superior Court Judge Manning in Leandro v. Statethat every child in the state has a constitutional right toa sound basic education. The Center for CommunityAction joined with other community groups to per-suade Robeson County to support and help fund thelitigation, which started in 1994. The case has resultedin a new funding formula at the state level for the dis-advantaged student supplemental fund. The revisedformula has provided $5 million annually in new fund-ing to schools in Robeson County since 2005, benefit-ing the county’s 20,000 public school students.Statewide, hundreds of thousands of students haveNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropySenior PharmAssist helps participants maximize medication benefits.

CHANGE turned out400 people to a public hearing on the bond, asking theschool board to provide 50 percent of the bond fundsfor renovating or replacing older schools. The boarddelayed passage of the original bond and worked withCHANGE leaders to develop a bond that met theirrequests. The resulting bond totaled $250 million andwas passed in 2006, benefiting the district’s 36,000students. The bond further ensured that schools whoserenovation was originally slated to begin in 2009 wererepaired in 2007 and 2008.Leveraging Federal Support – In 2007, HELP workedwith the Charlotte-Mecklenberg schools superintend-ent to increase enrollment under the SupplementalEducation Services Program. SES offered free supportfor low-performing, economically poor students in thedistrict because it was designated as under-performingunder No Child Left Behind. HELP built knowledge ofthe program and raised awareness in its memberchurches, helping to enroll 7,250 students in the pro-gram and resulting in the school district leveraging atleast $13,317,390 in federal funds.C. WHAT WORKS? EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES FORACHIEVING IMPACTThe organizations featured in this report used a varietyof strategies and tactics to achieve their impressiveaccomplishments. These include civic engagement ofaffected constituencies, building bridges with others,working in coalitions, partnering with lawmakers,reaching out to the media and conducting solidresearch. Working for systemic change often upsets thestatus quo, which can lead to conflict or disagreementswith those in power. The groups in the sample success-fully navigated the uncertainties they encountered.This section highlights at least one effective strategyundertaken by each organization, although the advo-cacy and organizing groups usually combined multiplestrategies to achieve success.1. Civic EngagementCivic engagement is a fundamental part of communityorganizing and most advocacy work, allowing groupshistorically marginalized and excluded from the pub-lic sphere to gain access to the decision-makingprocess. Engaging those people affected by policiesand programs directly can help to improve those poli-cies, advance democracy and promote a healthy soci-ety that creates more opportunities for all. Moreover,research over the last decade on “social capital”—theconnections and networks that bind people together ina broader social fabric—has demonstrated overwhelm-IN FOCUS: Bringing Out Your NeighborsFoundations Support Citywide Engagement21Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesThe new millennium is witnessing a con-certed effort by some foundations to getmore residents talking to each other andworking together to solve problems.Amy Lytle, executive director atHandsOn NWNC, thinks this is a goodthing. HandsOn NWNC works toincrease volunteerism and build thecapacity of nonprofits in Forsyth, Davie,Davidson, Yadkin and Surry Counties.“Our philosophy is that everyone hasthe ability to make an impact on thecauses they care about,” she explained.“But the infrastructure for volunteerism isnot as strong as it could be, and unfortu-nately it is seen as a cost-saving mecha-nism rather than added value for anorganization or community.” Some foun-dations have taken proactive steps tochange that.Citywide civic engagement effortsare underway in Greensboro with helpfrom a strong funder collaborative.Greensboro is fortunate to be home tomany local foundations that help sustainthe civic sector. Initially, five of thesefoundations came together in 1999 tocreate the Building StrongerNeighborhoods (BSN) program. TheCemala Foundation, CommunityFoundation of Greater Greensboro,Moses Cone~Wesley Long CommunityHealth Foundation, Tannenbaum-Sternberger Foundation and WeaverFoundation partnered with theGreensboro Public Library to providecoaching, technical assistance and smallneighborhood improvement grants in therange of $300 to $3,000. The JosephM. Bryan Foundation became a partnerin 2007. During an intensive outreachprocess, leaders from different neighbor-hoods expressed a strong desire to meetand learn from each other, and theydecided to produce the first Greensboroingly that all of society benefits when people are moreconnected to each other and to political and socialinstitutions.28TheWinston-Salem Foundation learned this lesson in2000 when it participated as one of 40 sites in theNational Social Capital Benchmark Study. As ScottWierman, the foundation’s president, notes, “Welearned from the national survey that our communitywas great at doing for others, but not as good as doingwith others. Clearly, it is through doing with others thattrusting relationships can be developed and realprogress can be realized. The foundation thus becamemore intentional in its efforts to fund programs thatemphasize the doing with opportunities.” These includ-ed supporting the formation of the ECHO Council, ahighly diverse group of broad-based community leaderscommitted to building social capital, and HandsOnNWNC, to connect potential volunteers with nonprofits.At the broadest level of engagement, the 13 groupsstudied in North Carolina collectively reached morethan one million people through their events, com-munity forums, newsletters, web sites, publications,print media and radio outreach. Nine of the organiza-tions have memberships, including individual mem-bers or organizations, such as church congregations,neighborhood associations and unions. The NorthCarolina groups engaged their members, constituentsand the broader public in a variety of ways between2003 and 2007:> 126,242 individuals became members of commu-nity organizations, either directly or through theircongregation or union.> 76,490 individuals attended public actions or meet-ings to voice their concerns about issues that affectthem directly.> 31,425 constituents communicated with policy-makers.> 8,799 unique (non-duplicate) individuals attended1,537 leadership trainings.> 3,113 individuals became core leaders of theirorganizations, thereby making a deep commitmentto improve their community.The specific skills and knowledge that leaderslearned included:> The nuts and bolts of grassroots organizing, includ-ing one-on-one relationship building, coalitionbuilding, policy development and research, negotia-tion, public speaking, power dynamics and analysis,campaign planning, congregational development,voter participation and meeting with elected officials.> Organizational development skills, includingstrategic planning, volunteer recruitment and man-agement, fundraising, holding productive meetings,conducting effective evaluations, communicationsand working with media.Bringing Out Your Neighbors (continued)Neighborhood Summit and form theGreensboro Neighborhood Congress.This alliance brings neighborhoodstogether to address issues of citywideconcern and also helps individual neigh-borhoods tackle problems. DonnaNewton, who staffs the congress, seesits immediate benefits. “The congress ishelping residents connect across raceand class” she observed, “And it isbuilding their confidence to interactdirectly with elected officials and bureau-crats to improve their community.”The neighborhoods also are takingon major issues together—and winning.Their first campaign was to get the cityto adopt a minimum code for rentalunits, a Rental Unit Certificate ofOccupancy (RUCO), to curb the leasingof substandard units by slumlords. Theysubsequently averted efforts by landlordsand developers to sunset the code,which has led to significant improve-ments in rental properties. The congressdrafted a public information policy andgot the city council to support it over thereluctance of the city attorney. Membersnow are working with a new assistantcity manager to implement the policywithin public agencies. And earlier thisyear, the congress succeeded in over-turning a 30-year-old exemption fromstate law, allowing residents adjacent topotentially rezoned properties to submita protest petition. In the words ofTara Sandercock, vice president for pro-grams at the Community Foundation ofGreater Greensboro, “The BuildingStronger Neighborhoods program andthe Greensboro NeighborhoodCongress are very effective. What’smaking them work is broad grassrootsparticipation and dedicated leadership.”22National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy23> Specific topics related to issues and constituencies,such as cultural identity and education, racial rec-onciliation and undoing racism, environmental jus-tice, budget and tax policy, parent advocacy foreducation, farmworker concerns and immigrationissues.The groups in the sample used innovative strategiesto engage communities. CHANGE congregation mem-bers volunteered to do audits of Winston-Salem neigh-borhoods, schools and health clinics to identify gaps inservices. For example, more than 125 CHANGE leadersconducted 15 neighborhood audits, documenting morethan 1,000 items needing attention. Similarly, 150 lead-ers toured 66 public schools and then met with princi-pals and the schools’ superintendent to address healthand safety concerns and inequitable learning condi-tions. This strategy not only engaged constituents, but itarmed them with solid data to bring to decision-makerswhen making the case for improvements.Student Action with Farmworkers (SAF) engagesboth its core constituency and the broader public inunderstanding and acting on farmworker concerns.Each year SAF’s Into the Fields program places 30bilingual college interns with farmworker communitiesto help them organize and access culturally and lin-guistically appropriate services. These interns, themajority of whom are children of farmworkers, alsoconduct community presentations, using creative tech-niques such as participatory theater and documentaryphotos and interviews to educate workers and raiseawareness of issues with the broader public. In part-nership with other organizations, SAF also sponsorsthe national Farmworker Awareness Week, whichcoincides with the birthday of Cesar Chavez, to raisecommunity awareness of farmworker issues. In 2008,SAF oversaw 350 events in 134 cities and 100 collegecampuses and high schools, involving more than30,000 people across the country.Mobilizing large numbers of constituents to com-municate directly with and challenge policymakersalso is extremely effective. Public accountability ses-sions are a tactic used by Industrial Areas Foundation(IAF) groups such as CHANGE, CAN, and HELP. In2004, DurhamCAN leadership learned that theDurham Housing Department had received $2 millionin federal funds to remove dangerous lead fromhomes, and they were shocked when the director ofthe agency informed them that she intended to give themoney back, even though the leaders had doneresearch showing many houses were likely to needabatement. The leaders invited her to come to a meet-ing in two weeks with 450 members and several elect-ed officials to address the issue publicly. Ivan Parra,lead organizer, recounted her reaction. “‘What if I donot come?’ she asked, and our leader responded, ‘Wewill ask the mayor to report on your behalf.’ ‘This is notfair,’ she replied.” The housing director did attend thepublic meeting after all and announced that the cityhad agreed to use the $2 million for lead abatement.2. Coalition BuildingThere is no question that coalition-building was criticalto achieving policy change, particularly at the statelevel, where broad-based support is necessary toappeal to a majority of legislators. Effective coalitionsdraw on the strengths of each member organizationand benefit from strong coordination and broad partic-ipation, including by unlikely allies:> To fill a constituency vacuum, Equality NC formedthe NC AIDS Action Network in 2005, whichlaunched its annual advocacy day and secured moreHIV/AIDS resources. Equality NC also pulled togeth-er unusual allies to address bullying, uniting with dis-ability groups like the ARC of NC to win the unprece-dented House passage of the School ViolencePrevention Act with LGBTQ-inclusive language.> With a grant from the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation, Senior PharmAssist convened stake-holders in 2006 to discuss Medicare reform andsoon created Advocates for a North CarolinaPrescription Drug Assistance Program. After their ini-tial policy successes, the advocates are pushing toexpand NCRx coverage and sustain the ChecKmedsprogram. “As a coalition, we have power,” notedGina Upchurch, executive director. “Elected officialscan’t easily dismiss or try to heavily influence thecoalition’s focus because we’re all in this togetherand have a process for making decisions.”> The EITC campaign coordinated by NC JusticeCenter demonstrated that building on the strengthsof coalition partners and combining multiple strate-gies can yield success in the face of political oppo-sition. Advocates in Raleigh educated legislators onthe issue, and membership-based groups generatede-mails, calls and letters to the governor and legisla-ture. Fifty coalition groups attended a press confer-Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities24ence with House allies; the diverse coalition gener-ated frequent press releases during the campaign.Representative Jennifer Weiss observed, “The JusticeCenter did a really good job of educating legislatorsabout the benefits of an EITC and also worked topush this important measure through, helping low-income working families in North Carolina.”> NC Housing Coalition intentionally built relation-ships with many groups to enhance its capacity andeffectiveness. “National research shows that afford-able housing is rarely a person’s top advocacy prior-ity, so we know that we have to link our issues toothers that have more traction,” said Chris Estes,executive director. During the Campaign forHousing Carolina, NCHC sought out nontraditionalpartners such as AARP-NC, the NC Coalition AgainstDomestic Violence, ARC of NC, the United Way ofNorth Carolina and the NC Bankers Association.Because of the immense need for affordable housingfor persons with disabilities, NCHC also has part-nered with the disability rights community to pro-duce the Affordable Housing Primer. The primerserves as a full resource guide on housing programs,fair housing laws and how to be an advocate onhousing issues. The published guide is offered inlarge print and braille, and in 2009 it will be updat-ed and offered in Spanish for the first time.Blueprint NC also has helped improve collabora-tion among statewide advocates. Blueprint was formedin 2006 with leadership from the Z. Smith ReynoldsFoundation, with the goal of increasing its 46 mem-bers’ individual and collective capacities to effectchange for the common good. They achieve this bycreating economies of scale to invest in shared toolsand resources related to civic and voter engagement,messaging and strategy development, building thebase of socially responsible voters and activists, and byfostering collaboration across issue “silos.” Executivedirector Julie Mooney explained, “Blueprint NC bringsorganizations together to examine where and how thestate policy-focused progressive advocacy and organ-izing community needs to build strength to be moreeffective, and then we invest in tools and strategies tosee that the work of partners adds up to more than thesum of its parts.”In any coalition, there is potential for tensions toarise, especially between grassroots organizations andstatewide advocacy groups. Toxic Free NC tries tomediate between these two constituencies. “We seeboth sides of the picture,” commented executive direc-tor Fawn Pattison. Pattison observed that statewideadvocates are protective of their relationships withelected officials and face enormous pressure to negoti-ate legislative solutions quickly, while grassroots lead-ers affected directly by the issue may be less willing tocompromise and often need more time to make deci-sions because they must consult constituents. Somenonprofit leaders suggested that tensions can be exac-erbated because state level advocacy groups often havewhite or middle class leadership, and grassroots organ-izations are more likely to be led by working class andpeople of color. “Grassroots organizations need capac-ity building so they can be more effective, equal part-ners,” concluded Pattison. “Resources tend to gravitateto bigger policy groups, and it becomes difficult forgroups on a shoe-string budget to sit at the same table.”Funders can help level the playing field by investing inthe capacity of grassroots groups to participate in thepolicy arena individually and collectively.3. Building BridgesAs is true throughout the country, there is a history ofracial tension in North Carolina. Here, the dynamichas been complicated further by the recent surge inimmigration. Many of the sample groups intentionallyhave sought to build bridges across race, class, religionand other divides to unite communities around com-mon concerns. This outreach process requires thought-ful deliberation and patience. CHANGE gradually hasbuilt a racially diverse interfaith membership of con-gregations that includes Baptists, Unitarians, MuslimsNational Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyPostcards and petitions both support ENC's statewide anti-bullying bill.Courtesy of Equality North Carolina.25and Jews. Lead organizer Rev. Ryan Eller observed,“The history of segregation in Forsyth County meansthat we have to build trust over time. CHANGE is overa decade old and for the first time, our leaders are will-ing to talk about issues in terms of racial disparity.” Thepresident of the Winston-Salem Minister’s Conference,Rev. Dr. Carleton Eversley, commented recently on thedifference CHANGE has made in local race relations.He noted that in the 1990s, very few white peopleattended a vigil in defense of Darryl Hunt, an innocentman imprisoned for 18 years on death row. Mostrecently, at a 2009 vigil for another innocent blackman, Kalvin Smith, more than half of the crowd waswhite. “CHANGE is the reason for that new interac-tion,” Eversley said. “We can now begin to act togeth-er and rebuild a little bit of the trust that has been torndown by racism.” This year CHANGE was awarded theMLK Dare to Make a Difference Award.The Center for Participatory Change builds thecapacity of community organizations in the 25 mostlyrural counties of western North Carolina, led by whiteAppalachians, African Americans, Latinos, Cherokeeand Hmong residents. CPC very intentionally bringsracial justice and human dignity lenses to its work andhas trained its board and staff to develop a commonanalysis of how power, privilege and oppression func-tion at the individual, institutional and cultural levels.The organization has internalized this learning andreorganized to have a non-hierarchical staff structure.As a result, the groups CPC works with now functiondifferently as well. For example, a coalition of eightwhite and eight African American churches has formedin Asheville and now is reaching out to immigrantgroups. The Waynesville African American communitycenter has developed relationships with Latino organi-zations. “It’s a big deal in Haywood County to havemultiracial leadership,” said CPC staff member CraigWhite. “And we have also helped several immigrantresource centers, which were originally founded bywhite people, adjust their leadership structures andlanguage practices so that Latino immigrants hadspace to take on leadership roles.”On the subject of racial bridge building, it is impor-tant to note the healing that has begun in the commu-nity of Greensboro from the 1979 shooting death offive people and wounding of 10 others prior to a com-munity rally. On November 3, 1979, members of theKu Klux Klan and American Nazi party shot the victimsas a multiracial group of activists gathered for astatewide “Death to the Klan” rally and conference forracial, social and economic justice, organized bymembers of the Communist Workers Party. The perpe-trators, caught on film in the act, twice were acquittedof wrongdoing. In 2002, the Beloved CommunityCenter spurred creation of the Greensboro Truth andReconciliation Commission, modeled on the SouthAfrican commission convened by ArchbishopDesmond Tutu. The commission was the first of its kindin the United States. It held a series of hearings andengaged hundreds of local residents in a public dia-logue about the event’s harmful and residual effectsthat resulted in unhealthy race relations. The commis-sion released a comprehensive report reflecting manyvoices, and it has followed up with town meetings toprocess the event and report findings further.294. Partnering with PolicymakersMost of the organizations in this report have built rela-tionships with local, state and federal legislators andother elected officials to advance causes of mutualconcern. It is entirely legal for community groups tomeet with politicians to educate them broadly aboutissues affecting their constituency. Organizations alsocan advocate for specific policy proposals. (See defini-tion of lobbying on page 6.) These types of relation-ships have proven critical to a number of impacts doc-umented in this report.The Center for Community Action (CCA) witnessedthe loss of thousands of jobs in Robeson County afterthe North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA) was imple-mented. In response, CCA leaders decided to take thisissue directly to Congress by organizing a forum inWashington, D.C., on rural job loss and the need foreconomic recovery. When their representative,Congressman Mike McIntyre, found out about theirplans, he offered to host the forum through theCongressional Rural Caucus. This was the first RuralCaucus meeting focused on job loss and positionedCCA as a knowledgeable resource. With help fromUNC sociology professor Leslie Hossfeld, CCA provid-ed credible research on rural job loss and detailed pol-icy proposals to foster sustainable economic recovery.The congressional hearing and follow-up generatedample media coverage on the issue of rural job lossand resulted in state and federal action to address theissue, including sections on entrepreneurship andlocal food systems in the 2008 federal farm bill. “Wework closely with our elected officials to develop andleverage social justice policy. We like to hold politi-cians ‘capable,’ not just ‘accountable,’” remarked CCAStrengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesWords and concepts can take ondiverse meanings from one communi-ty to another. According to SusanJenkins, “‘Advocacy’ and ‘organiz-ing’ are uncommon words in Indiancountry, but the ideas are certainlypart of our culture.” Jenkins shouldknow—she is executive director of theCherokee Preservation Foundation inCherokee, NC. The foundation wasestablished in 2000 and is financedby casino revenues through theEastern Band of Cherokee Indians(EBCI). The foundation is based in thesouthwestern part of the state on theQualla Boundary, home to half ofNorth Carolina’s 14,000 Cherokeetribal members. The foundation focus-es primarily on three funding areas:economic development, Cherokeepreservation and environmentalpreservation. Historically, maintainingharmonious relationships has been acentral value in Cherokee society,which means that the kinds of directtactics often associated with advoca-cy and organizing may not be cultur-ally appropriate on the QuallaBoundary. This emphasis on harmonyis exemplified by the phrase ga dugi, an important concept that Jenkinssaid literally means “helping hands”or “hands working together.”In this cultural context, “organiz-ing” is about helping Cherokee con-stituencies and institutions work togeth-er to achieve common goals. Forexample, as tourists first were drawnto the EBCI casinos, traffic toCherokee cultural sites declined. Inresponse, the foundation funded coor-dinated marketing and planningamong three cultural entities: QuallaArts and Crafts, Museum of theCherokee Indian and CherokeeHistorical Association. “Now the threegroups see the value of workingtogether,” observed Jenkins, “and theywouldn’t do it any other way.” Withthis organized effort, visits and salesbegan to increase dramatically. Inanother project, the foundation is help-ing to preserve Cherokee culture byboth teaching artisanal skills and alsoensuring that artisans have renewablenatural resources for their craft, suchas river cane used for basket weav-ing. This effort has mobilized artisans,academic researchers, land trusts,watershed associations, planners andlandowners, who now understand theimportance to the region of sustainingthese natural resources. For Jenkins,this initiative highlights an importantlesson for funders: “Success is notabout completing a project, butenhancing the skills and capacity ofcommunities on the ground.”Cherokee youth are another con-stituency that the foundation is helpingto bring together. A youth leadershipprogram for adolescents and teens ingrades 7 through 12 fosters leadershipconnected to the values, culture andlanguage of the tribe. For example,Grand Councils were conducted formany generations to deliberate onimportant matters and seek mutualunderstanding and consensus. TheCherokee Youth Council is modeled onthese councils, which gave everyCherokee a right to be heard, and itsmembers collectively decide the goalsand direction of the group. Their recentdecision to “go green” has inspired thewhole tribe, which launchedGenerations Qualla, a community-wideplanning process supported by thefoundation to promote alternative fuels,recycling, energy efficiency and greenbusiness development. The youth coun-cil’s Go Green Team has been leadingcleanup, recycling and habitat restora-tion efforts on the Qualla Boundary.“Leadership development and advoca-cy have to be connected to the historyand culture of the tribe to be effective,”concluded Jenkins.Peggy Hill-Kerbow is a member ofthe Cherokee Healing and WellnessCoalition, which seeks to help theCherokee Indian community heal fromhistorical grief and trauma. The coali-tion’s members believe the historicalsuffering of the tribe affects tribalmembers today in many ways. Withorganizing support from CPC, thecoalition has provided educationalopportunities to service and healthproviders about this dynamic so theycan treat Cherokee clients more effec-tively. Hill-Kerbow has found that itworks best to “meet people wherethey are”, i.e., by coming to theirhomes and communities to talk withpeople one-on-one before askingthem to participate. Hill-Kerbowrecalled how people would come toher grandfather to “talk” about whatwas on their mind. “‘Talking’ is notjust about verbal communication; it’salso about making initial contact,developing a rapport, trust, comfortand ease with someone, and buildinga sense of connectedness.” Shelearned that informal social gather-ings and meals were more likely toattract participants than formal meet-ings. Bringing in national experts onhistorical grief and trauma was notvery effective in getting the communi-ty involved. It worked better to buildoff of what communities already weredoing to heal, and to promote well-ness by demonstrating and nurturingthe core values of the Cherokee. Thecoalition develops activities focusedon Cherokee culture and history, theenvironment, youth education andsocial interaction.Further east in Robeson County,more than 47,000 NativeAmericans—primarily Lumbee andTuscarora—make up 37.2 percent ofthe population, representing one ofthe largest concentrations of Indiansin the country.32 Robeson County isnotably ethnically diverse; accordingto the U.S. Census, the population is36.4 percent white (non-Latino), 24.6percent African American, and 8.1percent Latino.33 Robeson Countyalso struggles with a poverty rate ofIN FOCUS: Advocacy Impacts in a Native American Context26National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyexecutive director Rev. Mac Legerton. “We think it'sreally important to be proactive and partner with elect-ed officials and not always see our role and position asreactive, adversarial and oppositional.” McIntyre alsosecured creation of the Southeast Crescent RegionalCommission (SCRC) in the 2008 farm bill. The SCRCwill target economic development in poor regionsacross seven states, including North Carolina.The three regional IAF groups, which together con-stitute North Carolina United Power, have collaborat-ed individually and collectively with policymakers.United Power developed a relationship with GovernorPerdue, in part the result of its hosting a well-attendednonpartisan gubernatorial candidate forum in 2008.Perdue has committed to meet with the groups’ lead-ers and members for an economic summit. HELP lead-ers worked with Charlotte Councilman John Lassiter toincrease job training and placement for youth and29 percent, which is double thestatewide level.34 Formed in 1980,the Center for Community Action andits leadership reflect the county’sdiversity. The organization’sapproach seeks to rectify longstand-ing racial inequities and address rootcauses of poverty by changing sys-tems. CCA has fought for NativeAmerican civil rights, access to afford-able legal representation, environ-mental justice, school reform andequitable racial representation on allmajor government boards. Thisapproach involves first “organizingpeople in their natural settings,”explained Legerton, “and then bring-ing them together.” After workingwith cultural groups separately, CCAthen unites them, using advocacy andlegal strategies to reform structuresand develop more culturally respon-sive services and programs. CCAalso has pushed for education curricu-la and family literacy programs thatare more culturally appropriate forNative Americans and all culturalgroups.While the work described above ishappening in specific native and ruralcommunities, some leaders are bring-ing a broader, statewide perspectiveto indigenous issues. ChristinaTheodorou, economic developmentspecialist for the North CarolinaIndian Economic DevelopmentInitiative, sees opportunities to organ-ize more resources for the benefit ofthe state’s native communities. “Myorganization was created to givetechnical assistance to Indian busi-nesses,” commented Theodorou, “Butwe’ve learned that T.A. alone isn’tenough.” She wants to promote fami-ly literacy, youth financial educationand individual development accounts(IDAs) and is trying to expand nativeawareness of the Earned Income TaxCredit (EITC). “The Lumbee tribe is thelargest in North Carolina, yetRobeson County has one of the low-est EITC claim rates in the state,” sheobserved. Theodorou would like tocreate a Native American AssetBuilding Coalition that can advocatefor these various types of programs.Another goal of Theodorou is toconnect native communities to the webof effective statewide advocacy groupsthat address poverty and children’sissues, such as Action for ChildrenNorth Carolina, Covenant with NorthCarolina’s Children and NC JusticeCenter. She is concerned that Indianconstituencies are not part of discus-sions about the state budget, andTheodorou believes that youngernative leaders may be more open tosuch advocacy approaches than aretribal elders. Interestingly, theCherokee Preservation Foundationfound that leadership developmentwas easier to initiate with youth thanwith Cherokee adults, because manyyouth already are connected to organi-zations. These various efforts toengage youth are building the nextgeneration of native leadership, a gen-eration that may bring new strategiesand approaches to their communities.27Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesThe Go Green Team of the Cherokee Youth Council is developing environmental projects, including com-munity clean-ups, recycling and environmental education, and natural habitat restoration.

Their ability to work effectively with localgovernment, churches, and private enterprise, hasmade them an exceptional partner, and we look for-ward to addressing the issues that face our communitytogether,” said Lassiter, now a mayoral candidate.5. Participatory ResearchMost successful impacts result in part from compellingresearch and policy proposals that persuasively makethe case for change to politicians, the media and thegeneral public. Our survey of groups found severalcases in which research was a central component ofthe effort. The Concerned Citizens of Tillery offers aninteresting case study in collaboration between aca-demics and a grassroots organizing group.The Community Health and EnvironmentalReawakening (CHER) project partnership betweenCCT and UNC dates back to the mid-1990s. CCT pre-viously had conducted its own informal studies to edu-cate policymakers; for example, in 1991, CCT mem-bers documented well construction dates, depths, andproximity to industrial hog waste pools. The studyhelped CCT and the coalition it formed convinceHalifax County to adopt an Intensive LivestockOrdinance in 1992, which set distances betweenindustrial livestock operations and wells and streams.Through the partnership, CCT and UNC have:> Conducted a survey to document the negativehealth impacts for families living near confined ani-mal feeding operations (CAFOs) – metal buildingscontaining thousands of hogs where hog waste,complete with remnants of antibiotics and hor-mones is recycled into field fertilizer. The surveyfound that people living within two miles of aCAFO reported more headaches, mucus membraneirritation, coughing and nausea than people livingnear a dairy operation and people not living nearany industrial livestock.30> Surveyed residents, finding that more than 90 per-cent of homes had wastewater pooled in their back-yards or driveways and/or backed up in their homeplumbing. As a result, the community won a hard-ship grant from the EPA to install a sewage line.> Quantified the disproportionate location of industri-al livestock operations (ILOs) in lower-income andAfrican American communities. Using data on thelocation and size of ILOs by census block andadjusting for populationdensity, the research foundthat ILOs were in fact farmore common in lower-income communities andcommunities of color. Theresults of this project,which used geographicinformation systems map-ping, spatial analysis andsurveys, led the Halifaxcounty commissioners topass an ordinance block-ing further expansion ofcounty hog operations.31Through its partnership with a renowned university,CCT has gained credibility with lawmakers and allies.The CCT-staffed environmental justice networkapproached legislators armed with proof of adversehealth impacts from industrial hog operations as wellas environmental racism exhibited by their dispropor-tionate location in lower-income and AfricanAmerican communities. As discussed in the Impactssection, in 2006 the state banned any new or expand-ed lagoons or sprayfields.The partnership also has engaged community mem-bers who might not otherwise feel empowered to standup to lawmakers. CCT’s Open Minded Seniors andNubian Youth led seniors and youth from other affect-ed counties to participate in the protest at the statecapitol in 2007, helping deliver the hog waste andresearch evidence that led to the state ban on new hogNational Committee for Responsive Philanthropy“H.E.L.P. has grown to be an integral part of dealing withcomplex social issues in the city of Charlotte. Their ability to workeffectively with local government, churches and private enterprisehas made them an exceptional partner, and we look forward toaddressing the issues that face our communities together.”—John Lassiter, Charlotte City Council Member, At Large29factories. As executive director Gary Grant observed,members of Open Minded Seniors grew up in the JimCrow era and systematically were denied access toeducation, services and civic life. Thus, the membersare “jubilant” that they now are able to politicallyexpress themselves.6. Other StrategiesWhile the strategies described above are some of thoseused most frequently by community organizations, ourresearch documented other creative approaches.Student Action with Farmworkers garnered extensivemedia coverage for FAN’s migrant housing campaign,successfully swaying the public and policymakers.After researching migrant housing regulations acrossthe country and launching the campaign, SAF generat-ed print, television and radio coverage continuouslythroughout the spring and summer of 2005. In additionto more than 30 media hits, SAF got coverage of theissue in a 30-minute documentary on Triangle area sta-tion WRAL-TV.The Center for Participatory Change helps individu-als and communities create alternative models andinstitutions that shift the locus of control from externalentities to them. As Craig White and Paul Castelloedescribe it, “We help groups understand the pros andcons of being part of mainstream institutions, and thenthey decide whether they want to relate to these insti-tutions or set up new ones.” CPC’s support of fourworker-owned cooperative businesses and its effort tohelp residents convert their mobile home park into aland trust are illustrations of developing alternativestructures to sustain communities.Building alliances with national organizations andmovements is another important strategy that wasemployed by the NC Housing Coalition for some of itssuccessful efforts. NCHC received technical advicefrom the Center for Community Change Housing TrustFund Project for its housing trust fund campaign andworked with the National Low Income HousingCoalition to win a national trust fund and to preventcuts to federal housing funds. Although immigrantrights organizations have not achieved success in theirstate campaigns yet, they continue to participate in thenational immigrant rights movement, which seeks ahumane path to citizenship.Legal strategies have been extremely effective inmoving the state toward more equitable funding foreducation, as evidenced by the decision in the Leandrocase that Center for Community Action actively sup-ported. Neighbors for Better Neighborhoods staffseeks legal action to address the plight of mobile homeresidents swindled out of money they thought theywere paying to buy their land but instead was taken byan unscrupulous landlord. Because federal funds thatsupport legal services for poor individuals cannot beused to aid undocumented immigrants, the NC JusticeCenter has picked up this responsibility. While thework involves individual representation, when moresystemic problems come to the lawyers’ attention, thecenter also engages in impact litigation on issues suchas migrant housing and employment. Despite theeffectiveness of litigation in creating systemic change,many funders are reluctant to support this strategy.D. VOLUNTARY AND EMERGENTORGANIZATIONS: BUILDING POWER WITHLIMITED CAPACITYIn North Carolina, NCRP’s methodology preventedinclusion in the sample of some effective groups thatdid not meet the criteria because they were less thanfive years old or did not have full-time staff engaged inadvocacy. Some of these grassroots groups are doingimportant organizing among workers and communitiesof color, yet they operate with very limited resourcesand little if any foundation support:> The Morganton-basedWestern NCWorker Center,which spun off from Interfaith Worker Justice tobecome independent in 2005 and received organ-izing support from CPC, partners with communitycenters and union-organizing efforts to help low-wage immigrant workers from Latin America,Mexico and the Hmong community address issuesof workplace injuries, unpaid wages and discrimi-nation. To date, the center has helped workersrecover at least $148,758 in wages, compensationand fines. The center was given the 2006 Defendersof Justice Award by the NC Justice Center.> A locus of important activity is underway amongseveral unstaffed organizations to strengthen work-ers’ rights, build black-brown unity and developbroad-based grassroots alliances for social change.Black Workers for Justice, founded in 1981, hasbuilt up a public sector union, the United ElectricalEmployees Local 150, with more than 2,500 mem-bers. In North Carolina, public sector employees donot have the right to bargain collectively, andBWFJ/UE 150 have created the Hear Our PublicStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities30employees (HOPE) Campaign, which got a billintroduced in the state legislature to overturn thisban. According to Ajamu Dillahunt, outreach coor-dinator at the NC Justice Center, “Just getting a pro-labor bill introduced is a big accomplishment.”> BWFJ joined with the Farm Labor OrganizingCommittee (FLOC) to create the African American-Latino Alliance to build solidarity among black andLatino workers. Unity is fostered through jointaction, including support for union struggles atemployers like Smithfield, which recently wasunionized, and Montcure Plywoods, where workershave been striking for months. “With local leader-ship from the Beloved Community Center, we heldour first black-brown unity conference inGreensboro last fall, and hope to host events ineastern and western North Carolina as well,”reported Dillahunt. At its Rocky Mount base and inWake and Orange Counties, BWFJ is buildingPeople’s Assemblies that have identified issues theywant to address, including health care, jobs, immi-gration/migration and police brutality.> The NC NAACP, which supports the HOPECampaign, has led “HKonJ” over the last threeyears. Historic Thousands on Jones Street was a2007 march in Raleigh that was repeated in 2008and 2009, continuing to draw 5,000 or more partic-ipants each year to the legislature. HKonJ leadershave developed a 14-point People’s Agendaendorsed by at least 75 organizations that calls fora repeal of the ban on collective bargaining for pub-lic employees, immigrant rights, universal healthcare and other reforms. At the February 2009 event,NC NAACP president Rev. William Barber urgedlegislators to avoid budgeting “on the backs of thepoor” to address looming deficits.35> In the under-resourced eastern part of the state (seepage 34), Association of Mexicans in NorthCarolina (AMEXCAN) is doing impressive workwith limited capacity by building a strong base ofmembership and partnering with allies that havegreater resources. Founded in 2001, this Greenville-based group has operated as a volunteer organiza-tion until the last few years, and it now has twopart-time staff people. AMEXCAN’s driving force,Juvencio Rocha Peralta, does this work on top ofanother full-time job at Lenoir Community College.AMEXCAN relies on volunteer coordinators in eachlocal county to recruit members, who are encour-aged to go through leadership training. In 2007,AMEXCAN conducted 27 trainings on federal‘287g’ legal provisions; 287g enables local andstate police to enforce federal immigration laws.36These know-your-rights and advocacy trainingsreached more than 10,000 people in eastern NC,and the effort helped educate local sheriffs. “A cou-ple of sheriffs were open to our message,” reportedRocha. “They made it clear that they want to protectresidents, not harass them.” AMEXCAN also hasreached out to African American leaders and elect-ed officials in the region, who have been supportiveof immigrants as they encounter tremendous back-lash. The organization is tackling several otherissues of direct concern to members. This past win-ter, 45 grassroots leaders attended a three-day train-ing on HIV/AIDS; they developed an action plan,and a core group committed to follow through onnext steps. AMEXCAN has also worked with ToxicFree NC to pass and implement a law protectingfarmworkers who complain about pesticide prob-lems from retaliation by employers and is applyingpressure at the local level to change the ban pro-hibiting undocumented immigrants from attendingcollege. AMEXCAN works closely with the NCJustice Center and El Pueblo on statewide advocacyand at the federal policy level with the NationalAlliance of Latin American and CaribbeanCommunities (NALACC).Clearly, some important advocacy and organizingwork is happening with few resources or paid staff. Yet,research shows again and again that lack of resourcesis a hindrance to nonprofit advocacy. Surveys of non-profits over the last decade by the Center for Lobbyingin the Public Interest (CLPI) and OMB Watch foundthat the number one obstacle to consistent, effectiveadvocacy is lack of financial and human resources.37Organizations need adequate funding and dedicatedstaff if their efforts are to be anything more than ad hocresponses to the ‘crisis du jour.’ And unfortunately, asone community leader bluntly observed, “Those thathave, get.” Organizations with strong capacity tend toattract funding more easily than those with fewresources.National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy31VI. Considerations and Recommendationsfor Foundation LeadersA. THE ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY INSUPPORTING ADVOCACY, ORGANIZING, ANDCIVIC ENGAGEMENTAs this report reveals, institutional philanthropy plays acritical role in supporting nonprofits to solve pressingproblems in North Carolina. Among the 13 groups inNCRP’s sample, foundation support for their advocacyand organizing work totaled more than $17.5 million,representing 86 percent of their total advocacy budgetsbetween 2003 and 2007.Some of the state and regional funders that have sup-ported the 13 groups include the A. J. FletcherFoundation, Community Foundation of Western NC,Fund for Southern Communities, Hispanics inPhilanthropy-NC,38 Kate B. Reynolds Foundation, MaryReynolds Babcock Foundation, NCGives, NC Health andWellness Trust Fund, NC Humanities Council, SouthernPartners Fund, Triangle Community Foundation,Winston-Salem Foundation, and the Z. Smith ReynoldsFoundation. Others mentioned in the report that supportadvocacy and civic engagement include CommunityFoundation of Greater Greensboro, Cemala Foundation,Moses Cone~Wesley Long Community HealthFoundation, Tannenbaum-Sternberger Foundation andWeaver Foundation. It is admirable that these fundershave exercised leadership to support civic engagementand policy change to improve North Carolina communi-ties. This list is not comprehensive, and many more foun-dations can achieve significant impact if they support theeffective advocacy and organizing nonprofits are under-taking throughout the state.Some of the national funders that have supported the13 groups include the American Dream Fund, CatholicCampaign for Human Development, Cedar TreeFoundation, Education Foundation of America,Environmental Support Center, Evangelical LutheranChurch of American (ELCA), Ford Foundation, FourFreedoms Fund, Freeman Foundation, Fulfilling theDream Fund, Gill Foundation, Harris & Francis BlockFoundation, Needmor Fund, Presbyterian Church USA,Public Interest Projects, Public Welfare Foundation,Racial Justice Collaborative, Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation, Rural Funders Group, State Equality Fund(Tides Foundation), and W.K. Kellogg Foundation.B. EFFECTIVE FUNDING STRATEGIESNorth Carolina offers many examples of philanthropicbest practices to support advocacy and organizing.Providing core support grants and multiyear funding,soliciting input from nonprofit partners and helping toenhance their capacity, exercising leadership on issuesand reaching out to peers in philanthropy to expandavailable resources are all important tools.The sample groups reported that receiving flexible,consistent funding is the grantmaking practice thatmost allows them to be effective advocates. Severalnonprofit leaders noted that improving programs andsystems often takes several years to achieve, yet manyfunders expect outcomes to occur based on one-yeargrant cycles. Multiyear support allows organizations tostabilize their capacity, set long-term goals andrespond strategically to community needs and policyopportunities as they arise.The chart on page 32 highlights the types of foun-dation support provided to the sample groups for advo-cacy and organizing between 2003 and 2007.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities32The levels of general operating support and multi-year funding provided to the 13 groups are commend-ably high. In the aggregate nationwide, for example,less than 20 percent of grant dollars are provided asgeneral operating support and fewer than 16 percent ofgrantmakers provide more than 50 percent of theirgrant dollars in this way. The fact that funders of thegroups in NCRP’s study provided such high levels offlexible and long-term funding bolsters the impact andeffectiveness of the groups.39The two foundations cited most frequently for beingexemplary partners with the nonprofits they fund wereZ. Smith Reynolds (ZSR) and Mary Reynolds BabcockFoundation (MRBF). More than one community leaderpraised ZSR for convening its grantees, listening tothem, and changing its practices to enhance nonprofiteffectiveness. A director of a grassroots organizationobserved, “The staff at Z. Smith Reynolds listened toorganizers, and as a result of what they heard, theymade their grants process easier and shifted to multi-year grants.” For example, ZSR recently instituted asimplified application process for grants of less than$35,000. The foundation also took leadership in con-vening statewide advocacy groups to coordinate civicengagement, communications and policy collabora-tion through Blueprint NC. “Having nonprofit advo-cates who can raise the levels of public discourse andaction about important issues of the day is critical for ahealthy democracy,” commented Joy VermillionHeinsohn, director for programs at ZSR. “Their voiceson behalf of those who are marginalized or underrep-resented must be present in the public policy arena,and foundations have a role to play in making sure thatthese organizations thrive.”Both ZSR and MRBF were commended for provid-ing unrestricted general support grants and for theirwillingness to be “learning organizations” that incor-porate feedback from grantees. “Babcock investsstrategically, thinks with us collectively, publishes use-ful work and gives us helpful guidance,” said one non-profit leader whose organization got help from MRBFon becoming multilingual. Babcock funded strategicplanning for another organization, which resulted inthe group shifting from a technical assistance role todirect organizing.Several community foundations provide organiza-tional development grants that prove critical to non-profits in building capacity for the long term. TheTriangle Community Foundation (TCF) also wasapplauded for its innovative practices. TCF set up acompetitive community grants program with a selec-tion team made up of fund holders. The program pro-vides grants in two areas: youth development and civicengagement. The program provides needed support;community organizations in this report appreciatedbeing able to obtain civic engagement funds to supporttheir organizing work. At the same time, the programeducates fund holders who are on the grantmakingteam about civic engagement. This process hasenabled the foundation to grow the grants pool by get-ting more fund holders on board.C. BUILDING NONPROFIT CAPACITYSeveral nonprofits stressed the value of having adequateresources for capacity-building. Fawn Pattison notedthat with a small, multiyear investment from theEnvironmental Support Center, Toxic Free NC was ableto provide staff and board development, fundraisingtraining, strategic planning and training in communityorganizing. “As a result of this modest investment of$1,500 to $8,000 a year, we now have a strongerboard, a more diverse and larger funding base, and weare more effective at what we do,” said Pattison. “Withthis increased capacity, we’ve won several campaigns.”National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyTYPE OF FOUNDATION FUNDING RECEIVEDby 13 Sample Groups for Advocacy, Organizing and Civic EngagementAGGREGATE AS PERCENT OF TOTAL MEDIANTYPE OF FUNDING AMOUNT RECEIVED FOUNDATION FUNDING AMOUNT RECEIVEDGeneral operating support $ 9,781,195 56 $ 194,025Multiyear funding $ 7,444,542 43 $ 306,150Capacity-building $ 1,219,797 7 $ 50,000Program Support $ 6,396,999 37 $ 350,000Total Foundation Support $ 17,504,542 100 % $ 730,339* Note that multiyear funding amount is excluded from total as it already is counted in other categories.**33Nonprofit leaders also note that while it can takeseveral years to achieve an issue goal, their organiza-tions still are building capacity in ways that continue toadd value in future years. It is important for funders tounderstand and recognize these capacity-buildinggains and interim benchmarks of success. A greatexample is the work of immigrant rights organizations.Although they have not yet succeeded in some of theirobjectives, the movement has been strengthenedthrough the process. Even initial defeats have beenopportunities for learning and growth. MelindaWiggins at Student Action with Farmworkers noted,“One of our biggest failures led to our organization ofthe Adelante Education Coalition.” In 2003, SAF part-nered with other groups to promote in-state tuition atpublic universities for undocumented immigrants.They organized the first Latino Day at the State Capitol,which drew more than 1,200 people in what may havebeen the largest advocacy event there ever. Yet, roleswithin that coalition were not defined clearly, and theanti-immigrant opposition was extremely well-organ-ized and effective at claiming to represent broad pub-lic sentiment. “Because of the difficulties with thesepolicy advocacy efforts, SAF initiated the AdelanteEducation Coalition,” Wiggins added, “so that wecould expand the network of groups publicly support-ing this issue and so that we could be more strategicand transparent in our collaborative work.”Strengthening Democracy, Increasing OpportunitiesThe eastern region of North Carolinacomprises the 41 most eastern coun-ties in North Carolina, and includesthe Inner and Outer Banks, alsoknown as the Coastal Plains. The east-ern region encompasses nearly 7,000square miles, with a population ofapproximately 1,000,000 and aworkforce of more than 400,000.41There is a stark contrast between theeastern region of North Carolina andthe rest of the state. Twenty-three coun-ties in North Carolina have povertyrates of more than 18 percent, and19 of them are located in the CoastalPlain region.42 Twenty counties havepersistent poverty. This increasinglydiverse region, which has experi-enced an influx of immigrants, revealsracial disparities. The poverty rate forrural blacks, 27 percent, is more than1.5 times greater than the rate forrural whites. In 10 Coastal Plain coun-ties, more than a third of blacks live inpoverty. The poverty rate for NativeAmericans is 22 percent and forLatinos, 28 percent.43According to Mulatu Wubneh, aprofessor at East Carolina Universityin Greenville, these economic dispari-ties can be attributed to the lack ofinfrastructure as well as falteringindustry.44 The short-term effects of the1998 tobacco settlement resulted infederal cutbacks in tobacco produc-tion, which had been a major contrib-utor to the state’s economy.45 An eco-nomic downturn that began in early2000 and long-term global economicrestructuring have added to large-scale job loss in the eastern region.An increasing dependence on agricul-ture, low-wage retail, and low skillmanufacturing, combined with a lesseducated work force, has hinderedthe region’s residents greatly in com-peting for living wage jobs.46 TheNorth Carolina Center for PublicPolicy Research found that the easternregion of North Carolina producesfewer college graduates and hashigher dropout rates than the rest ofthe state.47 College graduates oftensearch for employment opportunitiesin more promising parts of the state,leaving behind communities in des-perate need of their ingenuity anddeterring potential businessinvestors.48Nonprofit organizations play animportant role in the region, provid-ing needed basic services and foster-ing community development. Someorganizations are developing localleadership, building bridges acrossrace and ethnicity and seeking tostrengthen their local economies.CCA currently is exploring severaleconomic recovery strategies, includ-ing establishment of a regional foodsystem that would bring 100 agricul-tural jobs to a six-county region in thesoutheastern part of the state. Theproject focuses on advocating forchanges in the federal farm bill,including changes in institutional foodpurchasing that would give priority tolocal and regional foods and morefederal support for local food produc-tion and purchasing.Yet, nonprofits face many chal-lenges in attempting to serve andengage geographically dispersedpopulations with limited resources. Anincreasing number of rural nonprofitorganizations rely heavily on volun-teers. “Volunteerism is good,” notedGary Grant of Concerned Citizens ofTillery, “but you still need someone tocoordinate all that volunteer activity.And many of our volunteers are elder-ly—they will go to community meet-ings and the state legislature, butIN FOCUS: Eastern CarolinaLongstanding Challenges and Promising Opportunitiesthey’re not computer literate and can’tdo the office work we have to getdone.” The dearth of funding for non-profits focused on advocacy andorganizing in eastern NC has hin-dered grassroots activity.Even when foundation funds areavailable, nonprofits in the easternregion often find themselves strug-gling to meet funders’ basic require-ments. For example, as more founda-tions implement Web-based grant sub-missions, many nonprofits in this ruralregion are at a disadvantagebecause they lack basic access to theInternet. Some foundations such asthe North Carolina CommunityFoundation (NCCF) have beenresponsive to these constraints andeliminated requirements such asonline submission of grant applica-tions. However, because many of thesmaller, under-resourced nonprofitslack adequate grantwriting capacity,their applications may not meet fun-der standards.The challenging conditions in theregion and its lack of nonprofitcapacity are of great concern to sev-eral foundations in North Carolina.Since 1999, the Golden LEAFFoundation has allocated more than$32 million to address needs there.The Golden LEAF Foundation’s uniquemodel facilitates civic engagementand works with communities to maketheir own collective decisions aboutlocal funding priorities. The partner-ships span the breadth of nonprofitorganizations, local government, uni-versities and private companies.Additionally, efforts are underway byGolden LEAF and NCCF local boardsto promote sustainable growth of anagrarian culture and economy. PeggyBirkemeier, senior regional associateat NCCF, believes that educating non-profit leaders about their leadershiproles, fiscal stewardship, the impor-tance of grantwriting and capacity-building is critical to the vitality ofnortheastern North Carolina. NCCFhas demonstrated its commitment tocollaborating with entities such as NCGives, the W. K. Kellogg Foundationand the N.C. Center for Nonprofits tooffer programs aimed to provide localleaders with needed skills. In additionto training programs, Birkemeier alsosupported nonprofits as they appliedfor private foundation funding byoffering recommendations and guid-ance for grant requests. “Over thepast 10 years, since we began toserve this region, the NCCF hasworked hard to create a positive phil-anthropic climate. But this region,with its low wealth and low popula-tion density has not been a priorityfor many large funders, with someexceptions in the areas of health andeducation,” she said.Foundations certainly face manychallenges in seeking to support ruralcommunities and organizations.Compared to urban areas, ruralareas, both east and west, requiremore resources to serve fewer peopleIN FOCUS: Eastern Carolina (continued)North Carolina has some great models of philan-thropic support for capacity-building. Hispanics inPhilanthropy-NC has been highly effective at leverag-ing state and national foundation resources to strength-en the capacity of Latino-led and Latino-serving organ-izations, including SAF and the Coalición deOrganizaciones Latino-Americanas (COLA) in westernNorth Carolina. “HIP has helped grow the 20 Latinocenters I work with,” said COLA’s AdaVolkmer. “I don'tthink that Latino centers in western North Carolinawould be where they are today without HIP.”Yet, to getto that point, funders first needed to learn more aboutthe Latino populations and issues in their communi-ties. In 2002, national HIP leaders inventoried the stateand conducted educational seminars for NC funders.According to one account of the process, “For manyfoundation officers, learning that their state had 134nonprofits serving a Latino population approaching380,000 was a paradigm-shifting moment.”40 Untilthat point, many funders had no idea there were Latinoorganizations in their own backyards.D. FUNDER COLLABORATIVESFoundation collaboratives have been effective tools notonly to educate funders about issues in North Carolinabut also to leverage greater resources to address iden-tified needs. Getting a statewide HIP collaborative offthe ground was aided by Z. Smith ReynoldsFoundation, which offered to add 50 cents to everymatching dollar that HIP put on the table. TaraSandercock, vice president for programs at theCommunity Foundation of Greater Greensboro, notedthat the combination of known national funders suchas W.K. Kellogg and Ford Foundations and a well-respected state partner helped lend credibility andprestige to the effort. To date, 24 funders have investedin Phases I and II of the Funders’ Collaborative forStrong Latino Communities, creating a $2 million pool34National Committee for Responsive Philanthropyover a larger geographic region.Nonprofits have limited capacity toapply for and implement grant-fundedactivities. Yet, especially during eco-nomic downturns, grantmakers canuse their leadership position torespond to and address the needs oflow-resource rural communities,including in eastern North Carolina.Strategies implemented by area fun-ders include:> Fostering Collaboration: NCCFbelieves that the need forincreased funding collaboration innortheastern North Carolina is crit-ical. “It will take greater strategicefforts to make long lastingchange here in the Northeasternregion,” stated Peggy Birkemeier.The Cumberland CommunityFoundation (CCF) uses a uniqueapproach to foster nonprofit col-laboration. Through CCF’sEmerging Opportunities GrantProcess, grantees collaborate witheach other to receive joint grants,especially those involving commu-nity engagement, outside of theregular grant process. This encour-ages organizations to work togeth-er to achieve broader goals andallows CCF to respond flexibly tocommunity issues between grantcycles.> Training and Capacity-Building:NCCF, CCF and Z. Smith Reynolds(ZSR) have organized training ses-sions on writing grant applicationsand information forums to educatenonprofits about grant require-ments. The Blue Cross Blue Shieldof NC Foundation holds an annual“Healthy Communities Institute” tobuild the organizational capacityof nonprofits in the region. TheNC Network of Grantmakers spon-sored a foundation fair in the east-ern part of the state to connectlocal nonprofits to funders, and italso has convened funders andnonprofits to talk about environ-mental issues. Many foundationsfund scholarships for communityleaders to attend professionaldevelopment opportunities throughthe N.C. Center for Nonprofits.> Tapping Resources and Expertise:By engaging with public policyorganizations, think tanks, universi-ties and policymakers, funders canhelp communities leverage existingcapacity, knowledge andresources to solve the region’sproblems. According to DanGerlach at Golden LEAF, groupslike the NC Rural EconomicDevelopment Center, NC Centerfor Public Policy Research, and theassociations representing countycommissioners and municipalities,as well as the USDA, can assistfunders to make a real differencein eastern North Carolina.35that has funded a diverse set of 22 small and medium-size nonprofits since 2005.For Bob Wagner, vice president of programs atCommunity Foundation of Western NC (CFWNC),“Being part of a collaborative provides a funder withreassurance that other reputable funders are involvedand that even local and regional funders can have astatewide impact.” Put another way by Sandercock,“For funders who want to stick their toe in the water onsomething new, a collaborative effort can be a com-fortable way to learn the issues and make grants withconfidence.”In these collaboratives, advocacy and organizingoften are not the central focus or part of the initialthinking. As funders with a common interest collec-tively develop a theory of change about a particularissue and what it will take to address that issue, theythen see advocacy as one tool to help them achievetheir goals. For example, the CFWNC has involvedseveral funders, local governments, businesses andnonprofits in its Mountain Landscapes Initiative, whichseeks public input to develop tools for land use plan-ning and growth management in 18 western counties.The foundation has developed a toolbox that includestips on advocacy for local communities. As discussedearlier in this report, the Building StrongerNeighborhoods funding coalition has spawned theGreensboro Neighborhood Congress, which uses civicengagement to advocate for community concerns.In the health care arena, the CareShare HealthAlliance (CSHA) is a new statewide entity funded joint-ly by the Duke Endowment, Kate B. ReynoldsFoundation, Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation, NCHealth andWellness Trust Fund and NC Office of RuralHealth. It grew out of a May 2007 meeting of healthcare leaders in the state responding to the high numberof uninsured residents, lack of integrated services anduncoordinated funding silos. CSHA’s goal is to improveStrengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities4736the care of uninsured and lower-income residents byhelping safety net and health care providers around thestate create community-based healthcare collabora-tions. The alliance provides technical assistance andgrants to local collaboratives. In addition, the missionand committee structure of the organization indicate acommitment to informing public policy and engagingin communications, education and advocacy toimprove care for lower-income and uninsured NorthCarolinians.Modeled after education efforts in Ohio andDelaware, NCNG convened an Education FundersInitiative, which drew two dozen funders in the state aswell as regional and national funders, including TheBill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The initiativereleased a 2008 North Carolina Education Report thatNCNG is using as a starting point to engage funders,educators, government leaders and other stakeholdersin discussions about how to ensure the NC system suc-cessfully educates all students. The report providesthoroughly researched overviews of key issues andtrends and makes specific policy recommendations foreducation reform. The report also encourages bringingnew voices into the policy process and urges supportfor nonprofits that advocate on education issues, there-by highlighting the importance of civic engagementand advocacy in achieving long-term change.E. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUNDERCONSIDERATIONAs this report demonstrates, nonprofits in NorthCarolina are reaping tremendous benefits for disen-franchised communities and for the state as a wholethrough advocacy, organizing and civic engagement.Yet, there is so much more that needs to be done tostrengthen neighborhoods, improve education andhealth systems, provide affordable housing, createjobs, reduce disparities and bring the voices of affect-ed communities to bear in policy making. Local,regional and national foundations have the opportuni-ty to achieve long-term impact in critical areas throughtheir strategic support for advocacy and organizing inthe state. NCRP recommends the following next stepsto foundation leaders:Maximize grantmaking effectiveness. Overall,more funders can take further steps to increase theirimpact. These include looking at ways to streamlinegrant application and reporting requirements, provid-ing general support grants and multiyear commit-ments, and finding out from nonprofit partners how tobest support their capacity-building goals. Existinggrantees can also be a great resource in identifyingother organizations thatare doing effective workand could be future grantrecipients. In particular,funders can think aboutwhether constituenciesthat are affected directlyby key issues are beingengaged in solving prob-lems. Can the grantmakernurture the leadership ofunderrepresented com-munities better? Are theproblems that nonprofits are trying to address gettingworse over time? How does public policy help addressthe disparities affecting a funder’s constituencies? Howcan a foundation support the advocacy capacity ofconstituency-based organizations both individuallyand collectively?Find out more about advocacy and organizing.Funders that do not currently have experience support-ing advocacy and organizing can take a variety of stepsto learn more. Funder collaboratives are a great way tobuild knowledge about the role of advocacy in address-ing specific issues. The NC Network of Grantmakerscan help guide funders to collaboratives on specifictopics. Funders can sit in on meetings and talk to peersin a collaborative relevant to a particular grantmakingarea. Site visits are another great way to get a betterunderstanding of what advocacy and organizing areand how they play out “on the ground.” Several non-profit leaders mentioned that site visits helped fundersget a clearer sense of their work and its impact, as wellas the personal transformation leaders experience whenthey take action to improve their communities.National Committee for Responsive PhilanthropyCombining services with advocacy or organizingcan be an effective way to meet basic needs while alsobuilding the power and leadership skills of servicerecipients to directly participate in the democratic process.37Explore how services and advocacy can comple-ment each other. Especially in the current economicclimate, it is understandable for funders to want to nar-row their grantmaking to fund services that meet basicneeds. Yet, the economic crisis also means that funda-mental decisions are being made at all levels of gov-ernment about major societal priorities, and affectedcommunities need to be involved in those decisions.Combining services with advocacy or organizing canbe an effective way to meet basic needs while alsobuilding the power and leadership skills of servicerecipients to directly participate in the democraticprocess. Many of the small Latino organizations sup-ported by COLA are learning how to do both. CCAcombines both strategies through its family literacyprogram. And SeniorPharmAssist helps seniorsnavigate prescription drugplans while also advocat-ing to broaden andenhance access. Manyservice providers wouldlike to engage in moreadvocacy and organizing,but they simply lack theresources or skills to doso. In some rural commu-nities, service agenciesare the only groups with any capacity and therefore arepoised to play a vital role in engaging residents.Foundations can help nonprofit agencies add thesetools to their set of strategies.49 For example, as feder-al economic stimulus funds become available, founda-tions can help nonprofits advocate for funding for serv-ices to respond to the economic crisis affecting NorthCarolinians.Engage board members in dialogue about howadvocacy and organizing can help a grantmakinginstitution achieve its long-term goals. Trustees maynot know very much about advocacy, organizing andcivic engagement. They may believe mistakenly thatfoundations cannot legally fund such approaches,even though funders most certainly can and do.Advocacy and organizing can be demystified by shar-ing concrete examples from this report, and boardmembers can be encouraged to think of these strate-gies as potential tools among many that are needed toachieve change on issues they care about. “One mes-sage that the center sends to North Carolina nonprofitsis that it’s important for all of us to be advocates,because advocacy can help lead to systemic changethat addresses the root causes of the issues that ‘serviceprovider’ nonprofits are trying to solve,” noted DavidHeinen, director of public policy and advocacy at theN.C. Center for Nonprofits. “Foundations that supporteffective advocacy can help all nonprofits have agreater impact for their causes, making them far moresuccessful in the long-term.”Develop a collective philanthropic strategy forrural North Carolina. As this report demonstrates, ruralparts of the state experience greater poverty and lessnonprofit capacity. Yet, these regions also suffer fromlack of coordinated and substantial philanthropicinvestment. The types of approaches used by HIP NCfunders to grow the capacity of Latino organizations,many of which are in rural areas, could be explored foreastern North Carolina. Philanthropy in the state part-ners well already and has been able to raise awarenessof issues and contribute positively to needs of margin-alized groups and to the public discourse. For exam-ple, in western North Carolina, Cherokee PreservationFoundation, CFWNC, Mission Healthcare Foundationand United Way of Asheville and Buncombe Countyhave partnered to create WNC Nonprofit Pathways,which links local nonprofit leaders with learningopportunities, resources and support to help thembecome more effective in serving their community.50Funders have flexibility and can exercise strong leader-ship to make a difference in rural communities.Exercise leadership through research and conven-ing. For some funders, a good way to approach advo-cacy for the first time is to study a problem to under-stand the issues and potential solutions better.Research can be very valuable to inform public policyand program development, and it offers an opportuni-ty to learn more about and involve affected communi-ties in the process. By convening stakeholders to dis-Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities“Foundations that support effective advocacy can help allnonprofits have a greater impact for their causes, makingthem far more successful in the long-term.”—David Heinen, N.C. Center for Nonprofits38cuss the research findings, a funder can catalyze col-lective problem solving and action.Increase the percentage of grant dollars devoted toadvocacy, community organizing and civic engage-ment work. Philanthropic leaders nationwide, and theZ. Smith Reynolds Foundation in North Carolina, rec-ognize the significant benefits these strategies have forcommunities and consistently provide 25 percent ormore of their grant dollars for this important work.51They have decided that these strategies are effective increating long-term change on the issues the funderscare about most. If other funders increase the propor-tion of their grant dollars devoted to these strategies,they will strengthen the capacity of underserved com-munities to engage in a participatory democracy andcontribute to solving the state’s pressing problems.Build on existing successes. North Carolina non-profit and foundation leaders have much to be proudof and good models on which to build. For example,the formation of Blueprint NC and the nonpartisanengagement of thousands of new voters in 2008demonstrate the power of coordinated action at thestate level. Some nonprofit leaders have suggested thatthe next step is to strengthen the capacity of localgrassroots organizations to participate in a coordinatedfashion and be equal partners at the table withstatewide advocacy groups. The HIP collaborative’ssuccessful capacity-building efforts with Latino organ-izations suggest opportunities to explore capacity-building among other constituencies.NCRP, NC Network of Grantmakers, and N.C.Center for Nonprofits staff members are available tohelp North Carolina funders and nonprofit leadersthink through next steps to support effective nonprofitsthat use advocacy and civic engagement to strengthencommunities. A list of resource materials is available atwww.ncrp.org.National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy39VII. ConclusionAs this report demonstrates, analyzing just a smallsample of effective and diverse organizations inNorth Carolina revealed dramatic benefits for manyNorth Carolina residents and their communities—ben-efits achieved through advocacy, organizing and civicengagement. Foundation support was critical to theseachievements, and it will be integral to their future suc-cess as well. Notwithstanding these impressive accom-plishments, the state continues to face many chal-lenges in these uncertain times. Housing foreclosures,job losses and high dropout rates are just some of theissues requiring attention by legislators, who need theinformed perspectives of affected communities toguide them. For many of the important policy reformsdocumented here, groups will need to undertake fur-ther advocacy to defend, implement and strengthenthem. Foundation leaders may be tempted to retrench.Yet, these challenges demand bold action. NorthCarolina funders have many positive models of effec-tive grantmaking and collaboration to build on. With astrong statewide network and a growing philanthropiccommunity, North Carolina grantmakers are poised tostrengthen their voice in public policy through fundingand leadership. Allied with nonprofit partners whoknow how to bring community voices and innovativesolutions to the decision-making table, funders canmake a measurable difference in the lives of NorthCarolinians today and for years to come.Strengthening Democracy, Increasing Opportunities401.

One way they can accomplish that is by providing at least 25 percent oftheir grant dollars for advocacy, organizing and civic engagement. This aspirational goal is one of ten bench-marks in Criteria.Many grantmakers invest in advocacy, organizing and civic engagement as a way to advance their mis-sions and strengthen communities. A sizable number of foundations, however, have not seriously consid-ered investing in these strategies, partly because they have difficulty measuring impact and fully understand-ing how effective these strategies can be. The Grantmaking for Community Impact Project (GCIP) address-es these concerns by highlighting the positive impact that communities have seen through funder-support-ed nonpartisan advocacy and organizing.To provide foundations with useful information that can help them consider supporting these strategiesat higher levels, each GCIP report documents impact and demonstrates how advocacy, community organ-izing and civic engagement result in community-wide benefits and can advance a foundation’s mission.
