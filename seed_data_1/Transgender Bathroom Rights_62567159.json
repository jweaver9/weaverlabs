In its “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students,” the Federal Government has recently interpreted federal law as requiring that transgender students be permitted to use bathroom and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity in schools receiving federal funding. In two separate lawsuits, 20 states have challenged the legitimacy of this interpretation. This Article examines the current court battles over transgender bathroom and locker room rights and discusses possible outcomes of the most contentious legal issues in dispute. These issues include: the procedures used by the Federal Government in issuing its interpretation; the substantial legitimacy of the interpretation; and the Constitutional authority of the Federal Government to issue its interpretation. The Article concludes that courts should uphold the Federal Government’s recent interpretation of federal civil rights law because the Federal Government’s interpretation is a reasonable interpretation, lawfully issued, that mirrors the best medical and psychiatric practices for the protection and inclusion of a vulnerable group.Copyright © 2016 by Catherine Jean Archibald  * Catherine Jean Archibald is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Detroit MercySchool of Law.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 2 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 INTRODUCTION Title IX forbids sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding.1 However, Title IX allows sex segregated “living quarters,”2 and the regulations enforcing Title IX allow sex segregated bathrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.3 The Federal Government’s recent interpretation of Title IX and its implementing regulations as it applies to transgender individuals is that people with a male gender identity must be allowed to use the male facilities, and that people with a female gender identity must be allowed to use the female facilities.4 This interpretation is consistent with the most current medical and psychiatric recommendations for the treatment of transgender individuals,5 and accommodates those transgender individuals who clearly and consistently identify with being either male or female.6 This Article examines the current court battles over transgender bathroom and locker room rights7 and discusses possible outcomes of some of the most contentious legal issues in dispute in these cases. Part I of this Article discusses the current legal landscape regarding bathroom and locker room use by transgender individuals. Part II discusses the most contentious legal challenges to the Federal Government’s recent interpretation of Title IX and its regulations, contained in its “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students” (Dear Colleague Letter). The Article concludes that courts should uphold the Federal Government’s recent interpretation of Title IX because the Federal Government’s interpretation is a reasonable and lawful interpretation that followed all required procedures.     1.  20 U.S.C. § 1681 (2012).   2.

THE CURRENT LEGAL AND POLITICAL LANDSCAPE ON TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS AND THE LEAD UP TO THE DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”8 Title IX does, however, allow separate living facilities: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this chapter, nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit any educational institution receiving funds under this Act, from maintaining separate living facilities for the different sexes.”9 Additionally, Title IX regulations allow regulated entities to “provide separate toilet, locker room, and shower facilities on the basis of sex,” so long as the facilities provided for “students of one sex” are “comparable” to the facilities provided for “students of the other sex.”10 In recent years and months, there has been a torrent of legal activity surrounding the right of transgender individuals11 to access bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity. In courts, legislation, and agency interpretation of statutory and regulatory law, transgender individuals are gaining the right to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. In 2013, the Colorado Civil Rights Division, the agency charged with enforcing that state’s anti-discrimination laws,12 became the first government body in the country to rule that a six-year-old transgender girl, born a boy, must be allowed to use the girls’ bathroom at her school.13 In 2014, California passed a law allowing transgender youth to participate in sex-segregated sports, and use sex-segregated locker rooms and bathrooms in accordance with their gender identity, “irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil’s records.”14 Also in 2014, the high court in Maine became the first state court in the country to rule that a transgender     8.  20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  9.

In 2013, the United States Department of Education (DOE) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) jointly investigated a transgender boy’s complaint that his school was violating federal law by not allowing him access to the boys’ restrooms, locker rooms, and overnight sleeping accommodations.16 The resolution reached with the school district required that the district treat the student as a boy in all respects, including requiring the district to give him access to the boys’ restrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping areas for overnight trips.17 In 2014, the DOE investigated a complaint by a transgender girl that she was harassed and reprimanded by the school for acting as a girl.18 The resolution reached with the school required the school to treat her as a girl in all respects, including allowing her to use the girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms.19 In January 2015, the DOE issued an opinion letter stating that when a school has sex-segregated facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms, students should have access to the sex-segregated facilities based on their gender identity.20 This letter was the basis of the Fourth Circuit’s April 2016 decision finding that a transgender boy must be allowed to use the boys’ bathrooms at his Virginia public school.21 In November 2015, the DOE issued a letter to an Illinois high school, finding that the school had violated Title IX because the school did not allow a transgender girl access to the girls’ locker rooms.22 Under threat of legal action, in December 2015,   15.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 5 the school district agreed to give the student full access to the girls’ locker rooms.23 The school district’s change in policy prompted a lawsuit, currently pending, by parents of other students at the school.24 In June 2016, DOE found that an elementary school in South Carolina had violated Title IX when it refused to allow a transgender girl to use the girls’ restrooms.25 In the face of these steps forward for the transgender community, a political and legal backlash began in earnest in 2015. On November 3, 2015, voters in Houston, Texas voted to repeal a local antidiscrimination ordinance that forbade discrimination based on gender identity after vigorous campaigning warned voters that the law would allow male sexual predators to follow little girls into girls’ bathrooms to assault them.26 Then, on March 23, 2016, North Carolina introduced and passed a law, the North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, commonly known as “HB2” (house bill 2), requiring bathroom use according to biological sex, as stated on a person’s birth certificate.27  HB2 was passed in order to invalidate an antidiscrimination ordinance protecting transgender individuals from discrimination that had passed in Charlotte, North Carolina a month earlier.28 As a result of HB2, five separate lawsuits have been filed in federal court in North Carolina—one brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenging HB2,29 one brought by the U.S. government challenging HB2,30 one brought by North Carolina’s governor Pat McCrory,31 challenging the U.S. government’s request for the repudiation of HB2, one by members of the North Carolina legislature challenging the U.S. government’s request for the repudiation of HB2,32 and one by a nonprofit group called North Carolinians for Privacy challenging the U.S. government’s request for the repudiation of HB2.33    23.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 6 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 On May 13, 2016, the DOJ and DOE together released joint guidance entitled “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students” (Dear Colleague Letter) stating that in order to be in compliance with Title IX and its implementing regulations, schools receiving federal funding should treat transgender students in all respects as the gender that they identify with.34 Twenty states have challenged the validity of the Dear Colleague Letter in two separate federal lawsuits. First, on May 25, 2016, Texas filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, challenging the interpretation of Title IX found in the Dear Colleague Letter.35 Ten other states have since joined Texas in its challenge to the United States.36 Notably, twelve different states and the District of Columbia have since filed an amicus brief in the case supporting the United States’ position.37 A few months after Texas filed its challenge, the state of Nebraska and eight other states filed a similar lawsuit against the United States’ government in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska.38 The next section will discuss the main legal challenges raised by the Texas and Nebraska state plaintiffs and how courts are likely to decide on those legal challenges. II. THE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER The Supreme Court will rule on the issue of transgender bathroom and locker room rights, possibly in a consolidated case involving two or more of the abovementioned cases involving transgender bathroom rights that are currently making their way through the courts.39 In determining the outcome of  this case, the Supreme Court is tasked with answering the question: Is the federal government’s interpretation of federal law legally valid, and thus, must sex-segregated bathrooms, changing rooms, locker rooms in federally funded schools be accessible to students based on gender identity? The two challenges to the Dear Colleague Letter make three main arguments: 1) they state that the federal government’s Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because it was not issued through   34.

As will be shown below, none of these arguments should persuade the Supreme Court. A. The Procedural Challenges to the Dear Colleague Letter The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that the Dear Colleague Letter violates the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) because it was made without going through the proper procedures, namely, the notice-and-comment procedures.40 However, this argument is flawed because interpretative rules, or rules that interpret statutes and/or regulations, are explicitly exempted from notice-and-comment procedures by the APA.41 Under the APA, there are two types of rules that agencies can promulgate. First, so-called legislative rules have the “force and effect of law,”42 and they are made through a three-part-procedure known as “notice-and-comment” rulemaking that the APA lays out in 5 U.S.C. § 553.43 Under notice-and-comment rulemaking, the agency must first provide the public with notice of the proposed rule.44 Next, members of the public must have the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule, and the agency must consider and respond to “significant” comments received during the comment period.45 Finally, when the agency publishes the legislative rule, it must include a statement of the rule’s “basis and purpose.”46 In contrast to legislative rules, interpretative rules are also authorized under the APA in 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(4) and 553(b)(A). Interpretative rules are issued by an agency in order to help the public and regulated entities understand how the agency is interpreting the statutes and rules that it administers.47 Under the APA, these rules are explicitly exempted from the “notice-and-comment” requirement.48 Interpretative rules are not considered to have the same force of law that a      40.

Guernsey Memorial Hospital,52 a Hospital challenged a Secretary of Health and Human Services guidance document that explained how Medicare reimbursement to a provider would be calculated and paid for a loss resulting from refinanced debt.53 The guidelines in the document were not issued pursuant to notice-and-comment procedure, and instructed that payment to the provider should be in a different manner than was customary under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).54 The Hospital argued that the applicable statute and regulations required that GAAP should be followed, and that the guidance document thus changed the law contained within the statute and the regulations.55 The Supreme Court examined the statute and regulations and found that they did not require that GAAP be followed, but instead allowed for either GAAP or some other system of calculation, such as the one adopted in the Secretary’s guidance.56 The Court noted that “APA rulemaking would . . . be required if [the guidance document] adopted a new position inconsistent with any of the Secretary's existing regulations.”57 However, the Court found that because the guidance document was consistent with the Statute and regulations and was issued to advise providers how the Secretary would interpret the Statute and regulations in certain specific circumstances, it was a valid interpretative rule that did not require the notice-and-comment procedure.58 Additionally, if the rule in question does not change the enforcement ability of the agency because the agency already had the enforcement right at issue before the rule’s issuance, then the rule should be judged an interpretative rule and not a legislative rule.59 In American Mining Congress v.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 9 Administration, the court found that a rule stating that a certain type of x-ray reading qualified as a “diagnosis” of lung disease under agency regulations was a valid interpretative rule under the APA.60 The mining regulations required mining operators to report “diagnoses” of occupational diseases.61 The court found that the interpretative rule was a valid interpretative rule because it simply clarified the already-existing obligation to report “diagnoses.”62 As the court put it “the legislative or interpretive status of the agency rules turns on . . . the prior existence or non-existence of legal duties and rights.”63 The court reasoned that prior to the issuance of the challenged rule, the agency already had the power, to bring an enforcement action when a miner’s condition was not reported after the minor had the x-ray reading addressed in the challenged rule.64 Therefore, the court ruled that the challenged rule was interpretative, not legislative.65 For an example of when an agency must issue a legislative rule, consider the case of a statute that authorizes the EPA to create and then enforce air quality standards.66 Without issuing a rule setting air quality standards, there is nothing for the EPA to enforce, and there is no way for the EPA to bring an enforcement action under the statute. Therefore, when the EPA makes a rule setting air quality standards, the rule must necessarily be a legislative rule, issued through notice-and-comment rulemaking.67 Similar to the guidance document at issue in Shalala, which did not change what was required in the applicable statutes and regulations but merely advised regulated entities how the Secretary would interpret the law in certain specific situations, the Dear Colleague Letter also does not change what is required by Title IX and its regulations, but instead informs regulated entities how the DOE and DOJ are interpreting and intend to continue interpreting Title IX and its regulations. Title IX forbids sex discrimination in education, but allows schools to provide separate restrooms, showers, changing rooms, and sleeping areas designated for males and females if schools wish. This has not changed after the Dear Colleague Letter. What the Dear Colleague Letter does is let schools know that the DOE and DOJ consider it sex discrimination under Title IX not to treat transgender individuals according to the sex that they identify with.68 Additionally, the DOE and the DOJ define a student’s “sex” as a student’s “gender identity” for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations.”69 Finally, the DOE and the DOJ state that the sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX and its implementing regulations include gender identity discrimination and   60.

Since the letter does not conflict with the language of Title IX or its regulations,71 this letter fairly comes within the interpretative rule exception to the notice-and-comment procedures contained within the APA.72 In American Mining, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals found that because the agency had the ability to bring an enforcement action in the event a miner’s condition was not reported after receiving a certain x-ray reading, even before the rule in question was issued, then the rule in question was interpretative.73 Similarly here, the DOE and DOJ had the ability to bring enforcement actions, and in fact did bring enforcement actions, when transgender students were excluded from bathrooms and locker rooms that matched their gender identities, even before the Dear Colleague Letter was issued.74 Thus, the Dear Colleague Letter should be characterized as an interpretative rule under the APA. Therefore, the procedural arguments made by the Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs should fail in court.75 B. Challenges to the Dear Colleague Letter’s Interpretations of “Sex” and “Sex Discrimination” The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that The Dear Colleague letter is invalid because: 1) the terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” are not ambiguous and so should not be interpreted; 2) the Dear Colleague Letter is arbitrary and capricious; 3) when Congress passed Title IX, it did not intend for it to be interpreted as it has now been interpreted; and 4) the DOE and DOJ’s interpretation of “sex discrimination” and “sex” is inconsistent with prior interpretations made by those agencies.

The Question of Ambiguity The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that the Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because the terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” are not ambiguous, and the DOE and DOJ do not have the authority to interpret unambiguous terms.77 The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that “sex” can only mean “biological sex,” and that “sex discrimination” cannot include discrimination based on gender identity.78 However, because the terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” are ambiguous when applied to transgender individuals, the DOE and DOJ are authorized to interpret them in a reasonable manner. Agencies have the authority to interpret ambiguous statutes and regulations; agencies do not have the authority to interpret unambiguous statutes and regulations.79 The Supreme Court has held that the question of whether statutory language is ambiguous should be determined by examining three factors: 1) “the language itself,” 2) “the specific context in which that language is used;” and 3) “the broader context of the statute as a whole.”80 The same analysis applies in determining whether agency regulations are ambiguous.81 Even though a statutory or regulatory term may appear unambiguous on its face, a term’s ambiguity should be determined by looking at the specific context in which it is applied.82 In Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,83 the Supreme Court considered whether the statutory term “employee” was ambiguous as applied to former employees.84 The Court noted that “[a]t first blush, the term ‘employees’ . . . would seem to refer to those having an existing employment relationship with the employer in question.”85 However, after looking at the specific context of the statute, the Court found that former employees should be included in the statutory term “employee” because the statute allows “employees” to bring action against employers in certain circumstances and prohibits retaliation against employees for   76.

In the case of G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board,88 the court noted that even in dictionary definitions in 1972, the definitions implicitly acknowledged that not every animal (including humans) fit within the “typical” male or female definition.89 For example, one dictionary definition of “sex” defined sex as “the sum of the . . . peculiarities of living beings that . . . in its typical dichotomous occurrence is . . . typically manifested as maleness and femaleness.”90 This use of the word “typical” suggested to the court that even in 1972 when Title IX was enacted, there was acknowledgement that the “hard-and-fast binary division [into male and female] on the basis of reproductive organs . . . was not universally descriptive.”91 Next, the court noted that as applied to transgender individuals, the term “sex” was ambiguous, as “the regulation [allowing the separation of bathrooms according to sex] is susceptible to more than one plausible reading.”92 The court noted that the regulation itself could “permit[] both the [school’s] reading—determining maleness or femaleness with reference exclusively to genitalia—and the [Federal Government’s] interpretation—determining maleness or femaleness with reference to gender identity.”93 Another indication that the terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” are ambiguous when applied to transgender individuals is the fact that in the past courts did interpret those provisions to solely mean “biological sex” and “discrimination based on biological sex,”94 but now many courts have interpreted those terms as including “gender identity” and “discrimination based on gender identity.”95   86.

The Arbitrary and Capricious Standard The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that the Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because it is “arbitrary and capricious,” and thus in violation of the APA.96 The APA authorizes courts to set aside an agency decision if the decision is “arbitrary and capricious.”97 An agency’s decision is “arbitrary and capricious” if “the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.”98 When an agency issues a rule that is entirely contrary to its mandate under the law, a court may strike down the rule as being arbitrary and capricious.99 In Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company,100 the Supreme Court struck down a rule issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (a federal agency) that removed the requirements on automobile manufacturers to put either seatbelts or airbags in new cars.101 The Court found the rule was arbitrary and capricious because it went against the statutory mandate requiring the agency to make rules that increased automobile safety.102 The Court reasoned that since airbags were proven to save lives, there could be no logical reason for the agency not requiring them.103 Here, a court is likely to find that the Dear Colleague Letter is a reasonable interpretation of Title IX and its regulations, and therefore not arbitrary and capricious. First, there is no indication that the DOE or the DOJ relied on factors that Congress did not intend for it to consider, since it is unlikely that Congress considered the application of Title IX to transgender individuals in 1972.104 Second, although opponents of the Dear Colleague letter argue that allowing transgender individuals to access bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities would increase safety risks and decrease privacy risks, there is no  when an employee was fired for being transgender); Schwenk v.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 14 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 evidence to support these concerns. Instead, there is plenty of evidence from states and schools that already permit transgender individuals to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their identity, that the requirements outlined in the Dear Colleague Letter will not increase safety risks or result in privacy invasions.105 Third, there is ample evidence that treating transgender individuals in accordance with the gender that they identify with, including permitting them to access bathrooms and locker rooms that match the gender they identify with, increases health outcomes, and decreases discrimination against transgender individuals.106 Finally, many courts have already interpreted the terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” in the same way that the Dear Colleague Letter does. Recent court decisions recognize that discrimination based on gender stereotypes, gender identity, gender transition, or transgender status are a form of sex discrimination. In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,107 the Supreme Court in 1989 recognized that discrimination based on failure to conform to sex stereotypes was a form of sex discrimination.108 In this case, the Court found impermissible sex discrimination when an accounting firm decided not promote a female accountant at least in part because of the sex stereotype that she was too masculine and aggressive for a woman.109 In the course of her interviews regarding the potential promotion, she was told to take “a course at charm school,” try a “soft-hued suit or a new shade of lipstick,”110 and to “walk more femininely, talk more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry.”111 Transgender individuals do not conform to gender stereotypes because they do not conform to the gender stereotype that people identified-at-birth as male should grow up identifying as men, and that people identified-at-birth as female should grow up identifying as female. They often do not conform to sex stereotypes in terms of what names and pronouns they want to be called, and their dress and appearance.112 Thus, after Price Waterhouse, it is not surprising that courts have found that sex discrimination includes gender identity discrimination, gender expression discrimination, and discrimination based on transgender status. For example, in Schwenk v. Hartford,113 in 2000, the Ninth Circuit found that after Price Waterhouse, discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender and discrimination based on failure to conform to “gender expectations.” Furthermore, the court found that a prohibition on sex   105.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 15 discrimination “encompasses both sex—that is, the biological differences between men and women—and gender.”114 Therefore, the court found that an attack motivated by the attacker’s knowledge of the victim’s transgender status was “discrimination related to the sex of the victim” because the “perpetrator’s actions stem[ed] from the fact that he believed that the victim was a man who ‘failed to act like’ one.”115 “Discrimination because one fails to act in the way expected of a man or woman is forbidden.”116 As one court put it in explaining why discrimination against a transgender individual is discrimination based on sex: Imagine that an employee is fired because she converts from Christianity to Judaism. Imagine too that her employer testifies that he harbors no bias toward either Christians or Jews but only \"converts.\" That would be a clear case of discrimination \"because of religion.\" No court would take seriously the notion that \"converts\" are not covered by the statute. Discrimination \"because of religion\" easily encompasses discrimination because of a change of religion.117 Sensitive to the court decisions, the Federal Government (including the DOE and DOJ) has been consistent in recent years in the interpretation that sex discrimination includes gender identity and expression discrimination, and that transgender individuals should be treated in accordance with the gender that they identify with.118 This interpretation also accords with the latest medical recommendations as to the treatment of transgender individuals, many whom suffer from gender dysphoria, a condition characterized by a clinically significant distress over the      114.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 16 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 discord between the gender assigned at birth and the gender the individual identifies with.119 Discrimination can exacerbate this condition.120 Transgender students routinely worry about, face harassment in, and avoid using the restroom at school because they are not welcome to use the restroom that they are most comfortable in.121 This leads to behaviors such as: 1) going without using the bathroom all day at school, which leads to urinary tract infections, kidney infections, and constipation; 2) self-imposed dehydration and not eating, in order to avoid going to the bathroom, which leads to faintness and lack of ability to concentrate and engage in classroom and other learning opportunities; 3) not participating in after-school activities to limit time away from a home bathroom, which leads to increased stress, depression, and isolation, among other things.122 The appropriate treatment for gender dysphoria is “medical and social support for gender transition and, thus, the affirmation of the individual’s gender identity.”123 This includes permitting transgender individuals to access bathroom and locker room facilities that accord with their gender identity.124 Thus, the Dear Colleague Letter is likely to be found to be a reasonable and non-arbitrary and non-capricious interpretation of Title IX and its regulations. The interpretation is logical, is in accordance with the most recent court rulings on what constitutes sex discrimination, and it is in accordance with the most recent medical and psychiatric recommendations for the protection and inclusion of a vulnerable group. 3. Congressional Intent in Enacting Title IX The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that Congress did not intend that Title IX would permit transgender individuals to access bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity, and therefore Title IX should not be interpreted in that way now.125 However, this argument is faulty because: 1) the public is not bound by what Congress intends when it writes a statute, but is instead bound by what the words of the statute are; 2) even if the public were bound by Congressional intent at the time of statute enactment, there is no indication that   119.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 17 Congress considered the question of how transgender individuals should be classified or treated under the statute. Congressional intent does not determine how a statute may be applied after enactment.126 In Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services,127 the Supreme Court considered whether same-sex sexual harassment could violate Title VII’s prohibition of  “discrimination . . . because of . . . sex.”128 In determining that it could, the Court recognized that “male-on-male sexual harassment in the workplace was . . . not the principal evil Congress was concerned with when it enacted Title VII.” However, because the Court concluded that the statute covered the “reasonably comparable evil” of male-on-female sexual harassment, and it is “the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,” the Court held that same-sex sexual harassment could constitute a violation of Title VII.129 Similarly here, although Congress at the time of enacting Title IX in 1972 probably never considered the application of the statute it was passing on transgender individuals, the words of Title IX are what they are and must be interpreted in situations involving transgender individuals, as transgender individuals are also protected under Title IX from discrimination “on the basis of sex.”130 Thus, Congressional intent at the time of enactment of Title IX does not invalidate the Dear Colleague Letter. 4. Prior Inconsistent Agency Interpretation The Nebraska plaintiffs argue that the Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because the DOE and the DOJ did not always interpret Title IX and its regulations as they do now, and in fact, a prior interpretation of Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination in 2005 by the DOJ conflicts with the interpretation now found in the Dear Colleague Letter. 131 However, the fact that prior agency interpretations may conflict with the interpretation now made does not invalidate the agency interpretation.132 In fact, part of the value of interpretative rules is that they can be easily changed if the agency determines that its prior interpretations were incorrect or misguided.133    126.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 18 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 In the case of Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association,134 the Supreme Court clarified that an agency can change its interpretation of a statute or regulation, multiple times even, in its interpretative rules, and this does not render the last interpretation invalid.135 In Perez, the United States Department of Labor changed its mind in interpretative documents multiple times on the question of whether mortgage loan officers qualified as “administrative employees” under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which impacted whether they were entitled to overtime pay or not.136 The Mortgage Bankers Association sued, arguing the most recent interpretation was invalid because it conflicted with prior interpretations.137 The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that because under the clear language of the APA, an agency could issue an interpretative rule without notice-and-comment procedures, the agency could therefore issue a new interpretative rule which overturned the old rule, also without notice-and-comment procedures.138 Here, the Nebraska plaintiffs point to a conflicting interpretation by the DOE and DOJ dating back to 2005.139 However, this prior conflicting determination does not preclude the issuance of the Dear Colleague Letter now. In fact, for the past four years, the agencies of the federal government have been consistent in their findings under different laws prohibiting sex discrimination that transgender individuals should be treated as the gender they identify with for purposes of bathroom and locker room usage.140 Additionally, the Federal Government has been consistent since at least 2011 that discrimination based on gender non-conformity is prohibited sex discrimination under Title IX.141 Thus, the fact that the DOE and DOJ have not always interpreted Title IX as they now do does not invalidate the Dear Colleague Letter. 5. The Level of Deference the Courts Should Give the Dear Colleague Letter As discussed above, courts should find that the Dear Colleague Letter contains a reasonable interpretation of the ambiguous terms “sex” and “sex discrimination” contained in Title IX and its regulations. The next question is whether courts should defer to the agency interpretation or substitute their own interpretation of Title IX and its regulations in place of the agency interpretation. The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs do not raise this issue in their briefs. However,     134.  135 S. Ct. 1199, 1209 (2015).  135.  Id.  136.  Id. at 1201.  137.  Id.  138.  Id.   139.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 19 the United States will undoubtedly argue that its reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes and regulations should control.142 It will be correct. Courts should give deference to and uphold reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes and regulations both so that the public and regulated entities can rely on those interpretations and so that agency expertise can be brought to bear on issues of statutory and regulatory interpretation.143 However, the level of deference that courts should give to the Dear Colleague Letter is unclear. Under the Chevron Deference doctrine, courts should defer to agency interpretations of statutes so long as: 1) the statute is ambiguous; and 2) the agency interpretation is reasonable.144 However, the Supreme Court in United States v. Mead Corp.145 limited this level of deference to only applying where the agency interpretation is contained in a legislative rule.146 The Mead Court did indicate that Skidmore deference should apply to agency interpretations if Chevron deference does not apply.147 Under the Skidmore deference doctrine, the Court looks at the agency interpretation’s “ability to persuade” by examining the following factors: “thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade.”148 However, another deference regime, Auer deference, applies to agency interpretations of their own regulations. Auer deference requires a court to defer to an agency interpretation of its own regulation “unless that interpretation is 'plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,’” even if the agency interpretation is neither the only nor the best possible interpretation.149 The Auer deference doctrine has been questioned by three of the eight current Justices sitting on the Supreme Court, two of whom have indicated that they believe that no deference to the agency interpretations of their own regulations should apply.150   142.

Numerous scholars have also criticized the doctrine, raising many of the same concerns as the Justices. See, e.g., John F.

REV. 612, 654 (1996) (arguing that allowing a single agency to both make a rule and interpret the rule violates Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 20 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 It is unclear whether a court would find that the Dear Colleague Letter interprets Title IX, Title IX’s regulations, or both. Title IX itself prohibits sex discrimination.151 The Dear Colleague Letter interprets the meaning of “sex” and “sex discrimination,” suggesting that the Dear Colleague Letter is interpreting Title IX itself. On the other hand, Title IX regulations permit schools to have separate bathrooms and locker rooms based on sex,152 and the Dear Colleague Letter interprets how this provision applies to transgender students. Furthermore, Title IX regulations also prohibit “[s]ubjecting any person to separate or different rules of behavior, sanctions, or other treatment; . . . [or] [o]therwise limiting any person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity.”153 The Dear Colleague Letter also arguably interprets these provisions. If the Dear Colleague Letter interprets Title IX, it should receive Skidmore deference.154 If it interprets Title IX’s regulations, it should receive Auer deference,155 assuming that the Supreme Court decides to continue the Auer deference doctrine. If the Supreme Court decides to abandon the Auer doctrine, it is likely that Skidmore would apply.156 So, at the very least, it is likely a court will apply Skidmore deference to the Dear Colleague Letter. For the reasons articulated in Part II.B.2, it is likely that a court would find the DOE and DOJ’s interpretations of Title IX and its regulations persuasive, well-thought-out, and consistently applied, and thus uphold the Dear Colleague Letter under the Skidmore deference doctrine. C. The Constitutional Challenges to the Dear Colleague Letter The Federal Government has limited and enumerated powers, given to it by the United States Constitution, and may not exercise power outside of the powers granted by the Constitution.157 Title IX can be justified as a legitimate exercise of Federal power pursuant to two separate Constitutional provisions: The Spending Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Dear Colleague Letter and the Spending Clause Pursuant to Article 1 of the Constitution, Congress has the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.159 This gives the Federal Government the power to tax and spend, and thus influence areas of life that it could not otherwise directly control.160 However, although the Federal Government may, in using its Spending Power, influence and encourage States to act in certain ways or accept certain programs, the Supreme Court has likened the exercise of the Spending Power to the creation of a contract, and found that a State must voluntarily and knowingly accept the terms of the contract.161 Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that the federal government may not use “undue influence” or compel a state into action by using the Spending Power.162 In other words, State actors must have a choice in whether to accept or reject the conditions and the funding offered by the Federal Government, and may not be coerced into doing so.163 Additionally, exercise of the Spending Power must: 1) promote the “general welfare,” 2) “unambiguously” let States know what is required of them in order to receive funds, 3) be related “to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,” and 4) not be unconstitutional under other provisions of the Constitution.164 Opponents of the Dear Colleague Letter argue that it violates the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution.165 They make two main arguments: 1) that the Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because it coerces the states into accepting its rules by threatening the removal of all Title IX funds to a State if it does not comply, and 2) that the Dear Colleague Letter is invalid because it imposes a new condition on the states that was not clearly articulated at the time the States agreed to accept Title IX. As this Part will show, both of these arguments are flawed, because the interpretation of Title IX in the Dear Colleague Letter is not a new program imposed on States, but is instead a valid interpretation of Title IX, a   158.

Additionally, at the time of agreeing to Title IX, the States also knowingly agreed to allow the Federal Government to interpret the prohibition on sex discrimination contained within Title IX.166 a. Coercion and the Spending Clause Plaintiff States were not coerced into accepting the Federal Government’s interpretation of Title IX and its regulations because they knowingly accepted Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination and the Federal Government’s authority to interpret Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination.167 Additionally, the Federal Government’s interpretation is not a new Act that the States must be free to reject, but is rather a binding interpretation of an agreement they already accepted. The Spending Clause does not allow the Federal Government to coerce states into accepting new conditions or new programs by threatening the withdrawal of significant funds from existing programs.168 When Congress makes a law using its Spending Power, Congress may influence States’ choice to accept or reject the offer in the law by using either carrots or sticks, but may not coerce the States into accepting the offer by effectively giving the States no power to refuse the offer.169 However, this rule applies to new laws made by Congress, not to regulations and agency interpretations of law or regulations validly issued under a law already validly in existence.170 Under the Spending Clause, Congress may threaten the removal of funds in order to encourage a state to do something, so long as the amount of the funds at issue would not effectively leave the state no choice but to accept the federal offer.171 In South Dakota v. Dole,172 the Supreme Court found a federal law did not violate the Spending Clause when it required states to raise their legal drinking age to 21, or else lose 5% of their federal highway funding. The Dole Court asked whether “the financial inducement offered by Congress” was “so coercive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’”173 The Dole Court found that the pressure to raise the legal drinking age was only “mild encouragement” considering the relatively small amount of money at stake.174 Thus, the Court found no Spending Clause violation because the states retained the power to make their own decision regarding the legal drinking age “not merely in theory but in fact.”175    166.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 23 A law enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause that requires States to do something or else lose significant funds if they do not, is a violation of the Spending Clause if it leaves the States with no real choice but to do as the Federal Government asks.176 In National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,177 the Supreme Court found for the first time that a Congressional Act violated the Spending Clause of the Constitution.178 Before that, in the face of every Spending Clause challenge raised, the Court had found that the federal government’s action did not violate the Spending Clause, and had even expressed doubt that a request that a state do something with a monetary carrot attached could ever violate the Spending Clause, under the rationale that a state always had the option to reject federal money.179 In Sebelius, the Court considered a Spending Clause challenge to the Medicaid expansion provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”) brought by 26 states against the federal government.180 The decision was a split decision. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the plurality decision on behalf of three Justices and found that the Medicaid expansion provision violated the Spending Clause and the proper remedy was to strike the penalty provision in the ACA.181 Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurring and dissenting opinion on behalf of two justices, and found the Medicaid expansion valid but agreed that the proper remedy in case of a violation was to uphold the ACA but strike the penalty.182 Justices Scalia wrote a dissent for four justices, finding the Medicaid expansion provision of the ACA violated the Spending Clause and that the entire ACA should be struck down.183 The overall result was that the Court found that the Medicaid expansion penalty provision in the ACA was a violation of the Spending Clause, and the proper remedy was a striking of that penalty from the ACA. The Medicaid expansion provision at issue in Sebelius required states to greatly expand the number of people covered by Medicaid, or else risk losing all Medicaid funding, including for those people covered under the Medicaid law as   176.

Dole, where the 5% of federal highway funds at issue amounted to “less than half of one percent of South Dakota's budget at the time.”188 The Roberts plurality noted that in contrast to Dole, here, the threatened loss to the state was “over 10 percent of a State's overall budget,” and that therefore the threatened removal of funding was “economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion.”189 The Roberts plurality concluded that Congress had no constitutional right to force the states to accept the Medicaid expansion: “Congress may offer the States grants and require the States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer.”190 Justice Scalia’s dissent,191 which provided the additional justices needed for the Court to find a violation of the Spending Clause, also noted the drastic amount of money that was at stake if a state dared to refuse the Medicaid expansion: “more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures,”192 state expenditures being defined as “annual expenditures from the States' own funding sources, and it excludes federal grants.”193 Justice Scalia’s dissent called this a “severe sanction” if a state “refuses to go along.”194 He noted that “spending-power legislation cannot coerce state participation,” and that “if States really have no choice other than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the conditions cannot be sustained under   184.

In Dole, the challenged Act asked the States to increase their legal drinking age to 21 or else lose 5% of federal highway funding. In Sebelius, the challenged Act asked the states to expand Medicaid coverage to additional individuals or else lose all their federal Medicaid funding. By contrast, the Dear Colleague Letter is not an Act that asks a state to do something or else lose federal funding. Rather, it is the Federal Government’s clarification of terms found in Title IX and its regulations, as the Federal Government is authorized to do by Title IX itself and the APA.197 The Act that asked the states to do something or else lose federal funding was Title IX, which was signed into law on June 23, 1972.198 Thus, if the Nebraska or Texas plaintiffs wanted to allege a violation of the Spending Clause, they should have challenged Title IX itself. Neither set of plaintiffs have done so. An interpretative rule is not an offer for a contract with the states. Rather, it is an interpretation of terms of a contract already made between the states and the federal government, an interpretation validly made under the terms of the contract and applicable law.199 Most states have chosen to accept the conditions against sex discrimination that Title IX requires in order to receive federal funding for education.200 Thus, courts are likely to find that the Dear Colleague Letter does not violate the Spending Clause because of coercion.    195.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 26 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 b. Unfair Surprise and the Spending Clause Next, the Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs argue that the Dear Colleague Letter violates the Spending Clause because it is an unfair surprise that they did not sign up for at the time they agreed to accept the Federal Government’s offer of continued federal money for education in return for following Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination.201 However, this argument is faulty because, in accepting the offer inherent in Title IX, the States knowingly and voluntarily agreed to prohibit sex discrimination in education,202 and also knowingly and voluntarily agreed that the Federal Government would issue rules and regulations interpreting this prohibition.203 When exercising its Spending Power, Congress must “unambiguously” let States know what is required of them in order to receive funds, so that “States [can] exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation.”204 Congress may not “surpris[e] participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”205 States are bound by the language of the Spending Clause Act that they sign up for, and may not be surprised by additional obligations not contained within the Act they agreed to.206 In Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman,207 the Supreme Court examined the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975, which provided federal funds to help States care for the disabled so long as the States submitted plans found satisfactory to the federal agency responsible for administering the Act.208 In Pennhurst, disabled patrons sued a state-run institution for the disabled, alleging that the institution was in violation of the Act because of dangerous and inhumane conditions at the institution.209 The Supreme Court considered whether the Act created a legally-binding obligation on states that accepted the Act’s funding to treat the disabled with a certain level of care.210 The Court found that it did not.211 The Act stated in its “Bill of Rights” section that Congress found that “[p]ersons with developmental disabilities have a right to appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation for such disabilities,” and that “[t]he treatment, services, and habilitation for a person with developmental disabilities should be . . . provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the person’s personal liberty.”212    201.

United States, No. 4:16-cv-03117-JMG-CRZ (D. Neb. July 8, 2016).  202.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1681.  203.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1682.  204.  Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  205.  Id. at 25.   206.  Id.   207.  451 U.S. 1 (1981).  208.  Id. at 11, 14.  209.  Id. at 6.  210.  Id. at 15.  211.  Id. at 31–32.  212.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 27 The Court found that these provisions of the Act stating the rights of the disabled were “intended to be hortatory, not mandatory,” as evidenced by the fact that there was no termination of funding provision if the state failed to meet the standards,213 and there was no language indicating that the “finding” of Congress was meant to be binding on the states accepting the federal funds.214 The Court reasoned that, especially when “a State’s potential obligations under the Act are largely indeterminate” as they were here because “[i]t is difficult to know what is meant by providing ‘appropriate treatment’ in the ‘least restrictive’ setting,” Congress must “sp[eak] clearly that we can fairly say that the State could make an informed choice.”215 The Court concluded that “[i]n this case, Congress fell well short of providing clear notice to the States that they, by accepting funds under the Act, would indeed be obligated to comply with [the hortatory language in the Bill of Rights section of the Act].”216 Thus, the Court found that the Act did not create an obligation to treat the disabled with a certain standard of care because nowhere in the Act was accepting such an obligation made a condition of receiving funds.217 In Pennhurst, the Court found that the Act did not require States accepting funding to provide a certain level of care to the disabled. In contrast, Title IX very clearly and explicitly does require States accepting funding to not discriminate on the basis of sex.218 Title IX requires that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”219 This clearly puts a burden on education programs or activities not to discriminate on the basis of sex if they want to continue receiving Federal financial assistance. If that Act in Pennhurst had stated something like “no disabled person shall be denied appropriate treatment in the least restrictive setting under any care or treatment facility receiving Federal financial assistance” it would have been clear from the Act that treatment facilities receiving Federal financial assistance had an obligation to provide appropriate treatment in the least restrictive setting. Because what was required of States under the Pennhurst Act was different than what is required of States under Title IX, the obligations of States are different under each act. The Court in Pennhurst noted that the obligation to provide “appropriate treatment” in the “least restrictive setting” was “indeterminate,” so that it was especially important that the States know they were agreeing to meet this indeterminate standard.220 In the case of Title IX, the prohibition on sex discrimination could be seen to be indeterminate—people are likely to disagree     213.

Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 28 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 about what constitutes sex discrimination.221 However, in the case of Title IX, States did clearly agree to prohibit sex discrimination, and they clearly agreed to allow the Federal Government to determine what constitutes sex discrimination under the Act.222 Title IX provides that “[e]ach Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any education program or activity . . . is authorized and directed to effectuate the [prohibition on sex discrimination] with respect to such program or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability.”223 Thus, unlike the state in Pennhurst, which had not agreed to treat the disabled with a certain standard of care, States that accept federal funding for education programs have agreed to prohibit sex discrimination and to allow the Federal Government to make interpretations about what prohibiting sex discrimination requires. Furthermore, it should have come as no surprise to the States that the prohibition on sex discrimination would require continuing and ongoing affirmative changes in educational programs, given the vast and obvious disparities in opportunities for men and women in educational settings. For example, when Title IX was signed, about 170,000 men participated in college athletics, but only 30,000 women.224 Additionally, only 7% of high school athletes were female.225 The interpretation of what constitutes sex discrimination has changed to encompass things that likely would not have been imagined at the time Title IX was implemented, for example, to include same-sex sexual harassment.226 2. The Dear Colleague Letter and the Fourteenth Amendment The Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs do not acknowledge that Title IX and its rules and regulations, including the Dear Colleague Letter, are authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.227 However, the Fourteenth Amendment is a separate basis of authority for Title IX and its rules and regulations.228 Therefore, even if the Texas and Nebraska arguments that the Dear Colleague Letter violates the Spending Clause were correct,229 courts should still find that Title IX and Dear Colleague Letter are valid exercises of power under the Fourteenth Amendment.   221.

Part II.C.1, supra, shows why the Spending Clause arguments made by the Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs are not correct.  Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 29 The Fourteen Amendment to the United States Constitution contains the Equal Protection Clause, which provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”230 The Supreme Court has interpreted this Equal Protection Clause as forbidding sex discrimination by states unless the discrimination is substantially related to an important government interest.231 The Fourteenth Amendment also provides that “Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”232 Congress’s power to legislate pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment is not limited to those instances where it intends to legislate under, or states that it is legislating under, the Fourteenth Amendment.233 Rather, so long as an Act objectively enforces the Fourteenth Amendment, the Act is authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment.234 Additionally, an Act enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment must be “congruen[t] and proportional[]” to the Fourteenth Amendment violation it is meant to remedy.235 To be congruent and proportional, the Act must have been passed by Congress to correct widespread      230.  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV § 1.  231.  See, e.g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1973); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).  232.  U.S. CONST. amend. XIV § 5.  233.  See, e.g., Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. at 2598 (Roberts, J., plurality) (finding the individual mandate penalty in the ACA valid under taxing power of Congress, even though Congress did purport to use its taxing power because the “question of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress does not depend on recitals of the power which it undertakes to exercise”) (quoting Woods v. Miller, 333 U.S. 138, 144 (1948)); Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. at 2609, 2626 (Ginsburg, J., concurring and dissenting) (also finding the individual mandate penalty in the ACA valid under Congress’s taxing power and noting that the penalty was “collectible as a tax”); Franks v. Ky. Sch. for the Deaf, 142 F.3d 360, 363 (6th Cir. 1998) (“The question is whether Congress actually had the authority to adopt the legislation pursuant to [Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment], not whether Congress correctly guessed the source of its authority.”); Crawford v. Davis, 109 F.3d 1281, 1283 (8th Cir. 1997) (noting that the relevant inquiry is “whether Congress could have enacted the legislation at issue pursuant to a constitutional provision granting it the power to abrogate. As long as Congress had such authority as an objective matter, whether it also had the specific intent to legislate pursuant to that authority is irrelevant.”).  234.  See supra note 232.  235.  See, e.g., City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519, 534 (1997) (finding the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act invalid under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because: 1) there was no Congressional record of widespread intentional State discrimination on the basis of religion, and 2) the broad reach of the law’s application would mean that any state law could be found invalid if it burdened an individual’s exercise of religion with no compelling interest or least restrictive means applied). Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM 30 DUKE JOURNAL OF GENDER LAW & POLICY Volume 24:1 2016 Fourteenth Amendment violations by the States,236 and the Act must not expand too greatly the conduct prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.237 Since Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in education, and the Equal Protection Clause also prohibits sex discrimination in education, Title IX is “appropriate legislation” that enforces the Equal Protection Clause, and is therefore valid legislation authorized by the Fourteenth Amendment.238 Furthermore, Title IX is “congruent” and “proportional” to the harm that it is meant to remedy because at the time Title IX was passed, sex discrimination in state-run education programs was widespread and pervasive,239 and sex   236.  See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 530 (finding that RFRA was not authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in part because there was no Congressional record finding that State laws passed due to religious bigotry was a significant problem at the time RFRA was passed); Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 90 (2000) (finding that ADEA  was not authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in part because there was no Congressional record finding that unconstitutional age discrimination was a significant problem at the time ADEA was passed); Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 374 (2001) (finding that Title I of the ADA  was not authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in part because there was no Congressional record showing that discrimination against the disabled by States was a widespread problem); Coleman v. Court of Appeals, 132 S. Ct. 1327, 1334 (2012) (noting that in order to be upheld as valid under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, a challenged provision should be supported by “evidence of a pattern of state constitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow terms to address or prevent those violations”).  237.  See, e.g., Kimel, 528 U.S. at 80–81 (finding federal age discrimination law not authorized by Section 5 the Fourteenth Amendment because the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit States from discriminating based on age as distinctions based on age are subject to rational basis review, and noting that “Congress’ power ‘to enforce’  the [Fourteenth] Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment’s text” (quoting Flores, 521 U.S. at 536)).  238.  See, e.g., Crawford v. Davis, 109 F.3d 1281, 1283 (8th Cir. 1997) (finding that Title IX is authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because Title IX was “enacted specifically to combat” gender discrimination in education that is also prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause); Franks v. Ky. Sch. for the Deaf, 142 F.3d 360, 363 (6th Cir. 1998) (finding Title IX’s provisions valid under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment); Doe v. Univ. of Ill., 138 F.3d 653, 660 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding that “Congress enacted Title IX and extended it to the States, at least in part, as a valid exercise of its powers under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment”); Thorpe v. Va. State Univ., 6 F. Supp. 2d 507, 516 (E.D. Va. 1998) (finding that Title IX “may be regarded as an ‘enactment to enforce the Equal Protection Clause’” because Congress “could have enacted Title IX under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment”) (citations omitted); see also David S. Cohen, Title IX: Beyond Equal Protection, 28 HARV. J.L. & GENDER 217, 234 (2005) (discussing Title IX’s constitutional basis); but see Litman v. George Mason Univ., 5 F. Supp. 2d 366, 374 (E.D. Va. 1998) (finding that because “the substantive provisions of Title IX go beyond the Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibitions against gender discrimination . . . Title IX was properly enacted pursuant to Congress’ spending-power, and its spending-power alone”).  239.  See, e.g., Committee on Labor and Public Welfare Report on the Education Amendments of 1974 (March 29, 1974) at 77–79 (noting “extensive evidence of sex discrimination in . . . education”); Brake & Catlin, supra note 225, at 52–53 (1996) (noting great disparities between men and women in athletic opportunities in sports at the time Title IX was enacted); cf. Tenn. v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 525–26 (2004) (upholding Title II of the ADA as authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment in part due to substantial evidence of unconstitutional barriers to the disabled receiving public services and programs at time of the ADA’s passage); City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519, 530 (finding no evidence that State laws passed due to religious bigotry was a significant problem at the time RFRA was passed); Archibald Final 1/6/2017  4:49 PM  TRANSGENDER BATHROOM RIGHTS 31 discrimination is already prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment.240 Thus, even if the Texas and Nebraska plaintiffs’ Spending Clause challenges were to prevail in court, any court presented with the question should find that Title IX and its rules and regulations, including the Dear Colleague Letter, are valid exercises of power under the Fourteenth Amendment. CONCLUSION The Federal Government has recently interpreted federal law as requiring that transgender students be permitted to use bathroom and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity in schools receiving federal funding. The Article has shown that courts should uphold the Federal Government’s recent interpretation of federal civil rights law, as stated in its Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students, because the Federal Government’s interpretation is a reasonable interpretation, lawfully issued, that mirrors the best practices medical recommendations for the protection and inclusion of a vulnerable group.  Kimel, 528 U.S. at 90 (finding no evidence that unconstitutional age discrimination was a significant problem at the time ADEA was passed).  240.  See, e.g., Craig, 429 U.S. at 197 (sex discrimination subject to heightened scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (same); cf. Kimel, 528 U.S. at 90 (ADEA not authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because age discrimination is not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment as it is subject only to rational basis review); Bd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 360 (2001) (Title I of the ADA not authorized by Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment because disability discrimination is not prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment as it is subject only to rational basis review). While the Supreme Court has not yet considered whether prohibiting transgender individuals from using the bathroom that matches their gender identity is unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court should find that it is when it considers the question. See, e.g., supra notes 107–18 and accompanying text; see also Archibald, supra note 6, at 63–70 (arguing that sex-segregated bathrooms should be found unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment).

    "abstract": "After winning the right to same-sex marriage in all 50 states in June, 2015, the LGBT community is once again battling in court for its rights, this time for the right of transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity. In its “Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students,” the Federal Government has recently interpreted federal law as requiring that transgender students be permitted to use bathroom and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity in schools receiving federal funding. In two separate lawsuits, 20 states have challenged the legitimacy of this interpretation.\nThis Article examines the current court battles over transgender bathroom and locker room rights and discusses possible outcomes of the most contentious legal issues in dispute. These issues include: the procedures used by the Federal Government in issuing its interpretation; the substantial legitimacy of the interpretation; and the Constitutional authority of the Federal Government to issue its interpretation. The Article concludes that courts should uphold the Federal Government’s recent interpretation of federal civil rights law because the Federal Government’s interpretation is a reasonable interpretation, lawfully issued, that mirrors the best medical and psychiatric practices for the protection and inclusion of a vulnerable group",
