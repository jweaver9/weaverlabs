To my LGBTQ family worldwide, who, like me, have experienced suicidality: “It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is I know that you'll thank God you did” (Logic, 2017).  To myself, for completing this dissertation in spite of years of unspeakable grief and debilitating anxiety, and to honor my perseverance and strength: “I've been like a captured eagle, you know an eagle's born to fly Now that I have won my freedom, like an eagle I am eager for the sky And I can see the light of a clear blue morning I can see the light of brand new day I can see the light of a clear blue morning Oh, and everything's gonna be all right, It's gonna be okay” (Parton, 1977) To the 6 lives lost from the bridge collapse on March 15, 2018; the 17 lives lost, including Luke Thomas Hoyer, from the horrific school shooting at Stoneman Douglas   iv High School on February 14, 2018; the 5 lives lost at the mass shooting at Fort-Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on January 6, 2017; the 49 beautiful lives lost at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016; to the asylum-seeking children who are still separated from their families at the US border; to the memory of and pursuit of justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other beautiful Black lives taken by law enforcement and white supremacy; to the memory of the courageous transgender women of color who are murdered every year; and to the generations of individuals, including Pedro Zamora, who have died of AIDS-related compilations: I will never forget you. I will always honor your memory and fight for the justice that was denied for each of you.  To the person reading this: you are loved.  “So try to be the first one up the mountain And try to be the first to touch the sky And try to count your blessings and keep counting And try to soar where only eagles fly And if you fail at first just keep on trying Boy, you are not a failure in God's eyes The first step is the one that's always hardest But you won't amount to much if you don't try So spread your wings and let the magic happen Cause you'll never really know if you don't try” (Parton, 2014).     v ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I humbly acknowledge the following individuals for supporting me along the years I have spent braving this unchartered wilderness of my life along this dissertation journey.

Thank you for leaving a lasting imprint on my life. I hope that I have made you all proud.  “Ya know I've been thinkin' a whole lot lately about what's been and what awaits me It takes all I've got to give what life demands You go insane if you give in to it, life's a mill and brother I've been through it I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh and these northern nights are dreary and my southern eyes are teary As I wonder how the old folks are back home… …but I know that they all love me and I know they're all thinking of me And these smoky mountains memories keep me strong” (Parton, 2004). Furthermore, thank you Ken Barker for being the father I never had. I miss you every day. It was the greatest blessing of my life to sit with you while you passed on from this life. I will always remember you.  “Remember me, though I have to say goodbye Remember me, don't let it make you cry For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart Remember me, though I have to travel far Remember me, each time you hear a sad guitar Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be Until you're in my arms again, remember me” (Bernal, 2017).   viii To my brother, Christopher Burgess, along with my nephew, Odie Burgess: thank you for being my rock, my solid foundation that I can turn when life’s storms are too turbulent to face alone. Life made us brothers, but your unconditional love gave me my best friend. I love you and I am so proud of you.  “The wild dogs cry out in the night As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company I know that I must do what's right As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become” (Toto, 1982). To my mom, Judy Burgess: saying I love you does not begin to describe the depths of my gratitude for the lifetime of love that you have poured into me.  I think of the sacrifices you have made for me and the gifts that you have given me throughout my life (among them grace, compassion, and unconditional love) as a beautiful quilted patchwork that keeps me rooted in my heritage, connected to my inner child, and protected from the pain and hurt of the world. I will always love you, mommy. I am so grateful to be your Aaronbabe. This is for you: “Momma sewed the rags together, sewin' every piece with love She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of… My coat of many colors that my momma made for me Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money, I was rich as I could be In my coat of many colors my momma made for me” (Parton, 1971).    ix To Dolly Parton, your music has saved my life. And finally, to my future child, my Angel. Everything thing I have done so far has been to prepare a place for you. My heart is deep reservoir, continually filling with a profound and bourgeoning love for you. The thought of you has kept me going through these darkest nights of my soul. This is my promise to you:  \"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always  As long as I'm living my baby you'll be” (Munsch, 1986) and “Presto una luce ti illuminerà Seguila sempre, guidarti saprà Tu non arrenderti, attento a non perderti E il tuo passato avrà senso per te Vorrei che credessi in te stesso, ma sì In ogni passo che muoverai qui È un viaggio infinito, sorriderò se Nel tempo che fugge mi porti con te” (Bocelli & Bocelli, 2018).                  x ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION AN EXPLORATION OF FACTORS RELATED TO SUICIDALITY AND TRAUMA IN LGBTQ REFUGEES AND ASYLEES by Aaron Charles Burgess Florida International University, 2021 Miami, Florida Professor Miriam Potocky, Major Professor In a global context where attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers as well as LGBTQ human rights are becoming increasingly virulent, LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers are at an increased risk for a number of mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. While evidence has shown high prevalence of suicidality among refugees and LGBTQ people separately, no studies have specifically examined this phenomenon among those who are members of both groups – that is, LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore factors related to the experiences distress, trauma, and suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Utilizing a theoretical framework combining cumulative disadvantage theory, the minority stress model, and queer migration theory, a secondary qualitative analysis was conducted of interviews with 26 LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers in the U.S. and Canada. Thematic analysis was applied to understand the experiences of trauma, distress, and suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The results of this study indicated three themes related trauma, distress, and suicidality: internal and interpersonal supports, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. The findings are discussed   xi in light of the theoretical framework and the concepts of secondary exposure to trauma and retraumatization. Finally, the study’s limitations as implications for social work and recommendations for future research are presented.                                            xii TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHAPTER                PAGE  Chapter 1: Introduction          1 Study Purpose                1 Gaps in Knowledge           2 Significance to Social Work          2 Research Question           3 Target Population Identification         3 Conceptual Definitions of Key Terms        4  LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers       4  Suicidality, Trauma, and Adversity                   4   Chapter 2: Background          7 Context of Suicide           7 Overall Suicide Prevalence in the United States      7 Suicide Prevalence among LGBTQ Individuals       7 Suicide Prevalence among Refugees and Asylum Seekers      8 Suicide Prevalence with LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers              10  Global Experiences of Oppression in LGBTQ Individuals                11  Historical Context                                                                                           11 Current Impact of Global Oppression      12  Eurasia        13  East Africa        13  South America       14  The Middle East       15  Australia        15  Europe         16  North America       17  Human Rights and LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers     18   LGBTQ Human Rights Law       18 LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers                 21   Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework                   24 Cumulative Disadvantage Theory       25  Childhood Adversity         26  Complex Post-Traumatic Stress      28 Minority Stress Model         30 Queer Migration Theory         33  Theoretical Framework Integration       34  Chapter 4: Methodology        37 Research Question         37 Research Design         37 The Researcher         38   xiii Parent Study          39  Purposes of Parent Study       39 Sampling and Recruitment       40  Study Participants        41  Data Collection        41  Parent Study Findings        43 Study Procedures         43 Thematic Analysis Methodology       44 Data Analysis           45  Preliminary Phase        46  First Phase         47 Second Phase         48 Third Phase         48 Trustworthiness         49 Ethical Considerations        50    Chapter 5: Findings         51  Internal and Interpersonal Supports       52  Courage and Resilience       52 Importance of Human Relationships and Connection                                    53 Secondary Exposure to Trauma       54  Suicide in Informal Relationships      55 Retraumatization         59  Previous Experiences of Suicidality      60 Telling of Story Over and Over       63 Conclusion          67        Chapter 6: Discussion                     68 Interpretation of Findings        68  Internal and Interpersonal Support      70  Secondary Exposure to Trauma      71  Retraumatization        72 Integration of Findings       74 Limitations          75 Implications for Social Work & Recommendations     77 Conclusion          82  References          84 VITA                     101     1 Chapter 1: Introduction  Study Purpose  In a global context where attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers as well as LGBTQ people are becoming increasingly virulent, LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers are at an increased risk for experiences of suicidality. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the experiences distress, trauma, and suicidality among members of this population. This will be completed through the following areas of examination:  • a critical review of the literature related to suicidality, distress, global oppression, and human rights law for LGBTQ individuals,  • a theoretical framework exploring cumulative risk factors for suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers, and • the impact of trauma and distress on their experiences of suicidality across forced migration trajectories. This dissertation study is an in-depth analysis of global oppression and risk that LGBTQ individuals experience that may result in trauma, forced migration trajectories, and suicidality. Conversely, this study does not include an in-depth analysis of protective factors for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers related to oppression, experiences of trauma and suicidality, and other risk factors across system levels. Since a protective factor framework is outside the scope of this dissertation, this study will provide a foundation for which future study of risk and protective factors can occur. This study also lays the framework for which to further examine specific system levels of risk as well (e.g. the family, religious communities).    2 Gaps in Knowledge The scholarly literature yields limited findings related to the lives and experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. In fact, it is only within very recent history that there have been qualitative studies exploring the experiences of these individuals (Alessi & Kahn, 2017; Alessi, Kahn, & Chatterji, 2016; Alessi, Kahn, & Van Der Horn, 2017; Brice, 2011; Gowin et al., 2017; Kahn, 2013; Kahn et al., 2017; Logie et al., 2016). Evidence from LGBTQ media is critical to provide the most current information related to international laws, policies, and actions by state actors that have impacted human rights for LGBTQ individuals.  Due to the gap in scholarly literature coupled with the human rights violations perpetrated against LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers, it is important to explore their lived experiences, including experiences of suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylees to build a stronger conceptual and empirical foundation for practice as well as further research.  Significance to Social Work  This dissertation makes several novel contributions to the field of social work. This dissertation examines multiple areas that have previously been studied and integrates them to create an aggregate understanding of the complexities that emerge in suicide risk within this population. These areas of study include the following: suicidality in LGBTQ individuals, global LGBTQ oppression, human rights law, childhood adversity, premigration victimization, minority stress, queer migration, and idiom of distress. Moreover, this dissertation explores the potential impact of the forced migration trajectory (pre/post migration experiences) of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers on   3 their risk of suicidality. In exploring this area, this dissertation can provide insight into learning more about the experiences of trauma, distress, and suicidality of LGBTQ refugees and asylees that can be helpful in developing future research and culturally appropriate interventions.  Research Question This dissertation aims to answer the following research question: RQ: How do the experiences of stress and trauma of LGBTQ refugees and asylees shape their experiences of suicidality? Target Population Identification The target population for this dissertation is LGBTQ refugees and asylees resettled in the United States and Canada. There is evidence to indicate that LGBTQ refugees and asylees experience similar types of victimization regardless of their specific country of origin, including religious stigma, family rejection, gender roles/expectations, and community/locality based laws values (Alessi et al., 2017; Lee & Brotman, 2011; Shidlo & Ahola, 2013). Likewise, the background of this study describes suicidality, distress, and oppression that LGBTQ individuals (including refugees and asylum seekers) experience domestically and worldwide. The theoretical framework then provides context for which LGBTQ individuals may experience cumulative suicide risk. Finally, the two research questions of this dissertation will explore these factors at length related to experiences and suicidality and distress. A detailed description of the study participants is located in the study methodology.      4 Conceptual Definitions of Key Terms LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers   According to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR; n.d.-a), the term forced migration captures a broad range of experiences of displacement or involuntary movement. The official definition of a refugee is “someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution, war or violence. A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so” (USA for UNHCR, 2018, para. 1) .  Similarly, asylum seekers are persons who have fled their country of origin to seek refugee status, legal protection, and sanctuary in another country due to a well-founded fear of persecution (USA for UNHCR, 2018). In this study, an asylee is an asylum seeker who as obtained refugee status and legal protection. LGBTQ individuals refers to sexual minorities (e.g. lesbian, gay, bisexual), gender minorities (e.g. transgender individuals), and individuals who are questioning their sexual and/or gender identities. Consequently, an LGBTQ refugee or asylum seeker can be defined as an LGBTQ individual who has fled country of origin either by virtue of membership of this particular social group (LGBTQ identity) or persecution based on any of the other criteria.  Suicidality, Trauma, and Adversity The term suicidality captures an individual’s suicidal ideation and attempts (R. Meyer et al., 2010). The concept of childhood adversity emerged to capture the aggregate and accumulation of events that contribute to future negative outcomes, rather than a   5 relationship between a single adverse event and a single negative mental health outcome (Burgermeister, 2007). Since this time, hundreds of studies have examined types of childhood adversity (Evans, Li, & Whipple, 2013; McLaughlin, 2016) that have included parental loss, familial disruption, issues related to poverty (McLaughlin, 2016), and various types of child maltreatment (St Clair et al., 2015). Likewise, the concept of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is an integration of the public health ramifications of child maltreatment, particularly within the household or family system; this includes physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; physical and emotional neglect; exposure to domestic violence; exposure to substance abuse or extreme episodic mental illness; or exposure to criminal behavior (Anda et al., 2010). However, these experiences can also occur within the broader systems in which a child is situated (e.g., living and developing in poverty) (McLaughlin et al., 2014). These experiences create the experience of trauma, which is defined as harm to the mind, body or spirit as a result of the aforementioned hurtful experiences of abuse, neglect, and various exposure types (Whitfield, 1998).  Premigration victimization that LGBTQ individuals may experience in their country of origin may include the following types of experiences in childhood and adulthood: “verbal, emotional, physical and sexual abuse and assault, harassment, shunning, spitting, discrimination in housing and employment, destruction of property, blackmail, forced prostitution, forced heterosexual marriage, ‘corrective rape’ and coerced sexual orientation conversion interventions” (Shidlo & Ahola, 2013, p. 9). Resettlement then occurs when an individual with refugee status has gained approval and access to transition from the country in which they are seeking asylum to a sanctuary country for permanent settlement (UNHCR, n.d.-b). LGBTQ refugees and asylum   6 seekers encounter significant difficulties and trauma in their resettlement experiences as well. They may encounter continual and multiple types of victimization, isolation, and an inability to identify or utilize LGBTQ affirming services (Alessi, Kahn, Woolner, & Horn, 2018). They may also experience prejudice and discrimination in their communities for other intersectional factors related to their identities (e.g. being Muslim in a Christian community) (Alessi et al., 2018).  This chapter has provided a brief overview of the context purpose of the proposed dissertation. The next chapter will provide more in-depth background on suicidality and oppression of LGBTQ refuges and asylum-seekers.                  7 Chapter 2: Background  The purpose of this chapter is to provide a detailed context for which to understand how LGBTQ individuals (including refugees and asylum seekers) both experience and are impacted by suicidality, distress, global oppression, and human rights laws.  Context of Suicide Overall Suicide Prevalence in the United States  The Centers for Disease Control (2015) released a report on suicide that provides critical epidemiological data to frame the prevalence of suicide nationally. In the United States, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death across all ages combined. Further, there were 41,149 deaths by suicide in 2013 which is equivalent to 1 death by suicide every 13 minutes. Men represent 77.9% of all cases reported annually and are more likely to die by firearm injury while women are more like to have suicidal thoughts and die by poisoning. Among adults overall (ages 18 and over), an estimated 9.3 million (3.9%) reported suicidal thoughts; however, emergent adults (ages 18-25) reported suicidal thoughts at a rate of 7.4%. Further, this group had the highest rate among all adults of making a suicide plan (2.5%) (Centers for Disease Control, 2015).  Suicide Prevalence among LGBTQ Individuals  Much of the data related to suicide prevalence in LGBTQ individuals is focused on LGBTQ adolescents and young adults. While suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among young people ages 10 to 24 overall, the rate of suicide attempts is almost 5 times greater for sexual minorities in this age range compared to their heterosexual peers (The Trevor Project, 2019). Each episode of victimization (such as physical or verbal   8 harassment or abuse) increases the likelihood of self-harming behavior by 2.5 times on average (The Trevor Project, 2019). In Washington DC in 2013, for example, sexual minority middle schoolers were 5.6 times more likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts, 5 times more likely to have planned suicide and 5.3 times more likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual peers (Ost & Maurizi, 2013). Further statistics indicate that sexual minority high school adolescents are 1.9 times more likely to have felt sad or hopeless, 2.7 times more likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts, 2.3 times more likely to have planned suicide and 2.3 times more likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual peers (Ost & Maurizi, 2013). Further, high school age youth were 2.75 times more likely than their heterosexual peers to have seriously considered suicide in 2017 (District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education, 2017). A recent meta-analysis found that 29% of all transgender people have attempted suicide at least once in their lives compared to 4% of the general population and transgender adults were 14 times more likely to seriously consider suicide and 22 times more likely to attempt suicide than the general public (Adams, Hitomi, & Moody, 2017).  Suicide Prevalence among Refugees and Asylum Seekers Refugees and asylum seekers may face a myriad of risk factors that may contribute to suicidality as a result of their experiences from premigration to resettlement (Wasserman, 2017). However, there are minimal studies in the literature that investigate the impact of this trajectory of potential trauma and risk factors within these groups of vulnerable individuals. Only recently have studies emerged that examine suicide in small groups of individuals, typically of culturally homogenous groups. For example, a study   9 assessing prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among 444 African refugees in Nigeria found that suicidal ideation was significantly higher than among a non-refugee control group at rates of 27.3% vs. 17.3%, respectively (Akinyemi, Atilola, & Soyannwo, 2015). Further, the rate of suicide among Bhutanese refugees was found to be three times the US national average of 11 per 100,000 people (Refugee Health Technical Assistance Center, 2011).  An example of a larger scale effort is a 2005 meta-analysis by Porter and Haslam that examined 56 studies that investigated mental health outcomes for forced migrant populations. While not examining suicidality specifically, this meta-analysis identified the complex factors related to the sociopolitical context of the forced migration journey. These factors that contributed to worse mental health outcomes included internal displacement, having to repatriate once they had already left their country of origin, and lack of resolution in their original situation of conflict. This was especially true for refugees who had higher educational attainment, were older, identified as female, and those who had either higher socioeconomic status or rural residence in pre-displacement (Porter & Haslam, 2005).  While these studies begin to shed light on the particular high risk and needs of refugees and asylum seekers experiencing suicidality, further studies must occur (Wasserman, 2017) through large-scale quantitative epidemiological surveillance, intervention, and in-depth qualitative efforts. Further research should be conducted to explore these factors in relation to more complex factors like suicidality for broader refugee populations as well as specific subpopulations, such as LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers.    10 Suicide Prevalence among LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers  While statistics related to suicidality in LGBTQ young people and adults have become available in the recent years, there is still a gap in the literature related to the rates at which LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers experience suicidality. It has only been very recently that any qualitative studies and theoretical frameworks have emerged to explore the experiences of suicidality and broader mental health concerns of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers (Alessi & Kahn, 2017; Hopkinson et al., 2017; Kahn et al., 2017; Shidlo & Ahola, 2013). In late 2018, Alessi and colleagues published findings from a qualitative inquiry of 38 LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers that explored the impact of traumatic stress on the experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers who were seeking refuge in the Netherlands and Austria. Results of this grounded theory study revealed that while the most distressing event they had experienced occurred in the premigration setting of their lives, they experienced violence and trauma across their resettlement trajectory, including their migration journey and their arrival in both the Netherlands and Austria (Alessi et al., 2018). Further research must be conducted that includes discussion of experiences of suicidality in order to begin to contextualize the depth and complexity of this experience the lives of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers.   The preceding sections of this chapter have provided an in-depth review of the literature related to experiences of suicidality and distress. In the next sections of this chapter, global experiences of oppression experienced by LGBTQ individuals will be explored. This exploration of experiences will include historical oppression, a survey of   11 oppression presently experienced in different global regions, and an overview of human rights laws.  Global Experiences of Oppression in LGBTQ Individuals   There are many countries where LGBTQ individuals experience discrimination and stigma under oppressive state laws. In 2017, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) released a report that highlighted the prevalence of homophobic governmental laws related to the oppression and criminalization of LGBTQ individuals. World-wide, 72 countries criminalize same-sex relations; eight of those countries find same-sex relations punishable by death by either the sovereign state, regions under Shari’a law, or by non-state actors (Carroll & Mendos, 2017). Historical Context  Laws developed during global colonization have had long term impact on oppression against LGBTQ individuals. An example of historical influence impacting present day oppression against LGBTQ individuals is British colonialism, which left a particularly cruel legacy of oppression. Han and O’Mahoney (2014) reported that in the 1860’s, the British Empire mandated harsh laws throughout its colonies that made male-to-male sexual relations punishable by long-term imprisonment that were based upon the laws that they had first created in Queensland and India. Deemed a crime against nature in India, this act was punishable from up to 10 years and in other cases, life imprisonment (Han & O’Mahoney, 2014). These laws were enacted to both protect Christians from corruption as well as correct the customs of the indigenous populations (Human Rights Watch, 2013). In fact, it has only been since September of 2018 that the Supreme Court   12 of India annulled Section 377 and legalized consensual gay sexual activity (Westcott, 2018).   However, these laws were not evenly enacted throughout the British colonies. They had an extensive range. A 2018 report from The Conversation, an academic focused journalism based website, noted the following: in Ghana, punishment was defined as a misdemeanor with up to 3 years imprisonment; in Gambia, Kenya, and Nigeria, a felony with up to 14 years; and most extreme being Uganda and Zambia, where a life sentence was the maximum (Han & O’Mahoney, 2018). Uganda in particular has felt the impact of these laws to the present. In 2014, the country attempted to make homosexual acts punishable by death, but this was ruled unconstitutional (Okiror, 2018). External influence by American Christians on Ugandan political leaders has made the climate for LGBTQ individuals in Uganda even more dangerous. Nelson reported in 2016 that a United States Christian pastor, Scott Lively, was sued by LGBTQ activists in 2012 under an Alien Tort Statue for violating international law by inciting violence and discrimination against LGBTQ individuals in Uganda (Nelson, 2016).  Current Impact of Global Oppression   Much of the recent information related to the experiences of LGBTQ individuals living under global oppressive laws and cultures can be found in the literature as well as online news sources and activist publications. There has been a recent insurgence of LGBTQ discrimination and oppression happening globally that is present in such additional sources. Examples of this oppression can be found worldwide, such as the following.    13 Eurasia. In 2017, global media and LGBTQ news outlets began reporting on the “anti-gay purge” in Chechnya. It was reported that 79 gay men had been evacuated from Chechnya while 27 men were reported to have experienced torture and detainment and 15 were released who subsequently vanished, raising fear of honor killing at the behest of Kremlin-backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov (S. Walker, 2017). Organizations like the Moscow Community Center have been of vital importance in helping gay men flee Chechnya to safety through volunteer networks (Kramer, 2017). During that time, only one individual was able to shed eyewitness testimony to the atrocities endured by those detained. For example, it has been reported in various outlets that Maxim Lapunov, a 30-year-old gay-identified man, reported being detained on the street and held for 12 days in a blood-soaked cell where he was beaten, degraded, and threatened by police (Rainsford, 2017). However, even if these LGBTQ individuals in Chechnya are able to flee from this region, they may still find themselves in an oppressive state. Although the Moscow Community Center is an LGBTQ serving organization, it is exists within the oppressive Russian state where propaganda, laws, and societal attitudes may make it still challenging for individuals to find refuge from persecution (RFE/RL, 2018).   East Africa. Similarly, on October 31, 2018, it was reported that regional Tanzanian governor Paul Makonda issued a vow to arrest all individuals suspected of being gay by police as well as mandated reporting from every citizen (Adebayo, 2018). This has come with the announcement of a 17-member team of police, media, and state actors to enforce the illegal nature of being gay in the country as well as the closure of HIV clinics that have been accused of “promoting homosexuality” (“‘Anti-gay’ force launched in Tanzania,” 2018, para. 10). These harsh and negative attitudes toward   14 LGBTQ individuals in Tanzania are believed to stem from the still active anti-sodomy laws that were enacted during British colonization (Kirby, 2018).  Saltnes and Thiel (2021) describe the complexities of LGBTQ rights and policies in Uganda. They discuss the use of LGBTQ rights as a political tool utilized by semi-authoritarian President Yoweri Museveni since 1986, that ultimately led to the passing off the ‘kill the gays bill’, which made British colonial era criminalization upgraded to include the death penalty. While rescinded due to the major international attention received by Western donor states, LGBTQ rights are still at risk in Uganda to date (Saltnes & Thiel, 2021). While major Western donor states successfully applied pressure to rescind this cruel and heinous law, radical conservative Western religioun influenced Ugandan leaders. Scott Lively, an American Christian radical, was a key contributor to the ‘kill the gays’ death penalty law through his continual spread of anti-LGBTQ inflammatory rhetoric with key Ugandan political and social leaders (Blake, 2014).   South America. In Brazil, new right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been very active in systematically targeting LGBTQ interests. On his first day of office, Bolsonaro issued executive orders removing the LGBTQ from consideration within the protections of his administration’s human rights ministry (Savarese, 2019). In doing so, he has named a human rights minister, Damares Alves, who has been on record in stating that not only do diversity policies threaten families in Brazil, but that the most basic gender roles will be reinforced from the earliest ages within Brazilian society (Gstalter, 2019). Further, Bolsonaro has spoken out against LGBTQ individuals visiting Brazil. He released an official statement, proclaiming that he did not wish for Brazil to become an LGBTQ   15 tourist destination due to his ideas of the potential detrimental impact of the presence of LGBTQ individuals having sex on Brazilian families (Phillips & Kaiser, 2019).  The Middle East. In the Middle East, LGBTQ people are faced with unique barriers and challenges. They may face extreme prejudice and violence from their own families as well as in their communities; likewise, there is unique pressure on sexual minorities (and gay men in particular) to consider gender reassignment surgery in order to comply with cultural and religious expectations or face certain discrimination even leading to death (Carter, 2011). Laws in Iran against LGBTQ individuals are informed by Shi’ism and the direct influence of the Qur’an, thus merging state law, religious code, and heteronormative social values (Jafari, 2013).  A very recent documentary explores these dynamics. Released in February 2019, Birds of the Borderland provides vignettes of four individuals from countries like Iraq and Syria who describe their lied experiences of being LGBTQ in regions affected by war (Issa, 2019). One individual under the pseudonym Youseff describes experiences of violence including the loss of his partner to gun violence in his home city of Baghdad, Iraq before seeking refuge in Australia (Issa, 2019).   Australia. It should be noted that although Australia is a country where refugees and asylum seekers seek refuge, it has been documented that many have become detained at Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist, was one of many asylum seekers who attempted to arrive in Australia by boat and was indefinitely detained at Manus Island (Boochani, 2019b). In addition to his own harrowing story detailed in No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison (Boochani, 2019a), he also has been able to shed light on the experiences of LGBTQ asylum seekers detained   16 alongside him. These accounts included rape, violence, and isolation while in indefinite detention, and in some cases, the difficult choice to return to their countries of origin which they had initially fled (Boochani, 2018).  Europe. While Europe remains a sought-after place of refuge for LGBTQ immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, there has been a rise in violence against LGBTQ individuals there as well. The Metropolitan Police in London reported a steady increase of homophobic hate crimes from 2015 to 2018 (Metropolitan Police, 2019). In June 2019, a lesbian couple was attacked on a London bus by a group of four teenagers who demanded they kiss. When they refused, the teenagers harassed them and ended up breaking their nose and jaw, respectively (Gajanan, 2019; Perrigo, 2019).   Other countries in Europe have also seen a very recent rise in LGBTQ violence. In July 2019, the New York Times reported that thousands of protestors met a small group of LGBTQ individuals attempting to march in a pride parade in Bialystok, Poland. Dozens were injured as a result of bricks, stones, fireworks, and rotten food being thrown as well as direct physical altercations (Santora & Berendt, 2019). Later, in August 2019, approximately one thousand individuals celebrated pride in the city of Plock, Poland, while protected by police suited in riot gear (Plucinska & Ptak, 2019). Poland’s Catholic Church has also taken strong stance against the LGBTQ community. In August of 2019, it was reported that the archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jedraszewski, delivered a sermon to honor the 75th anniversary of Nazi resistance in Warsaw, where he likened the movement for LGBTQ equality to that of Communist rulers (Pempel, 2019). This sentiment aligned with Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party who claim that the concept   17 of LGBTQ rights is both foreign and dangerous to traditional values and families (Plucinska & Ptak, 2019).  Across the European Union (EU), results from the 2012 EU LGBT Survey conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) reported that 1 in 4 lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex individuals had experienced either threats, physical or verbal violence in the preceding 5 years (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2012; ILGA Europe, n.d.). Further, 66% of all respondents from EU member states reported fear of public displays of affection – holding hands in public with their same sex partner; 75% of gay and bisexual male respondents reported this fear (ILGA Europe, n.d.). North America. In the United States, LGBTQ asylum seekers (particularly those from Central America) are currently experiencing new difficult challenges and barriers in seeking refuge along the southern border. In addition to reports of harassment and violence along their migration journey (Del Real, 2018), it has been reported that LGBTQ individuals in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted; while making up only 0.14% of the detention population, they had reported 12% of the total sexual assault claims in 2017 (Moreau, 2018). The American Civil Liberties Union, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, and the Santa Fe Dreamers Project have issued a joint report that 12 gay and transgender individuals in ICE detention have experienced sexual assault and physical abuse from fellow detained individuals, harassment from ICE guards, denial of hormone therapy, and solitary confinement as retaliation for speaking out about their negative treatment (Moore, 2019). Further, a 2018 letter from 37 Democratic Congress members reported   18 similar treatment of gay and transgender detainees, including 13% of 300 transgender individuals placed in solitary confinement in 2017 (Moore, 2019).  Human Rights and LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers LGBTQ Human Rights Law  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in 1948 by the UN General Assembly, represents “universal recognition that basic rights and fundamental freedoms are inherent to all human beings, inalienable and equally applicable to everyone, and that every one of us is born free and equal in dignity and rights” United Nations, n.d., para. 2). This human rights instrument was created in response to the human rights violations and atrocities incurred during World War II as a pledge to the inherent dignity of every human (Andreopoulos, 1998). It is the defining document from which all other human rights efforts through the United Nations have evolved.   The 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, ratified by 145 state parties, is the legal document that originally defined the term refugee as well as detailed the rights of individuals who are displaced and the legal obligations of nations to afford them protection (UNHCR, n.d.-c). The defining principle that governed this document was that of non-refoulement, which avowed that “a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom” (UNHCR, n.d.-c, para. 2). Consequently, the concept of asylum seeking evolved from this seminal treaty.   Although the UDHR was formally adopted in 1948, it has only been in the past two decades that LGBTQ individuals have been explicitly included into the global stage as protected under the principles therein. As of 2001 the following four of five universal   19 human rights treaties incorporated language that explicitly called for protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation:  • 1999 – CEDAW – Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women  • 2000 – ICESCR – International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights • 2000 – CRC – Convention on the Rights of the Child • 2001 – CAT – Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Alston & Goodman, 2013).  Further, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution as of June 2016 that called for the “protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity” (p. 1) as well as requested annual reporting from a designated Independent Expert to report findings to the United Nations Human Rights Council (United Nations Human Rights Council, 2016). The creation and implementation of this mandate was heavily contested; it was not only approved by a narrow margin (23-18 with 6 abstentions), but a further bloc attempt by conservative state actors attempted to thwart its implementation and funding (Smith, 2017).   Another major milestone in the advancement of human rights for LGBTQ individuals in the international stage was the convening of human rights experts in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2006. This convention, and the subsequent Yogyakarta Principles, was in response to global reports of documented human rights violations and abuse directed toward LGBTQ individuals (Yogyakarta Principles, 2016). These   20 principles align with the UDHR to address “the need for a consistent understanding of the comprehensive regime of international human rights law and its application to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity” (Yogyakarta Principles, 2016).   In 2017, the Independent Expert designated by the UN Human Rights Council released a global status report on the conditions that LGBTQ individuals experienced (Smith, 2017). This report served multiple functions. The Independent Expert laid out a foundation that both aligned sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) issues and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals within the scope of existing international human rights frameworks while concurrently reinforcing the message that SOGI protections are not new or different but rather an integration into the existing framework of protections for individuals who are members of a particular from social group (Smith, 2017). Additionally, this report made the following six recommendations for addressing the root causes of violence and discrimination:  1. decriminalization of consensual same-sex relations  2. effective anti-discrimination measures  3. legal recognition of gender identity  4. destigmatization linked with depathologization  5. sociocultural inclusion  6. promotion of education and empathy (Smith, 2017). It is difficult to measure the direct impact that these human rights advancements have made in the lives of LGBTQ individuals and in the areas of the world in which they are targeted. This is especially true in countries and localities that reject these recommendations in favor of more conservative laws and values. Do these advancements   21 in human rights impact the experiences of suicidality within LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers? It is much too early to indicate. However, this identification of root causes of violence and discrimination paired with international pressure for human rights recognition are potential antecedents to such determinations. It is important to consider the complexities of these root causes when examining their contributions to an outcome disparity such as suicidality. There is an urgency to this research, particularly in a global context where attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers as well as LGBTQ human rights are becoming increasingly virulent. LGBTQ Refugees and Asylum Seekers  Under international law, LGBTQ people who have a credible fear of persecution qualify for asylum under the “membership in a social group” category. While an increasing number of countries, including the United States, grant asylum on this basis, the application of the refugee definition to LGBTQ persons remains inconsistent (UNHCR, 2012). Additionally, there are many challenges associated with attempting to quantify the number of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers in the world. The UNHCR (2018) has officially reported that as of mid-2018 there were approximately 28 million refugees and asylum seekers in the world (25 million refugees and 3 million identified asylum seekers, respectively). However, these numbers do not include individuals who have not attained these official legal statuses.  Identifying LGBTQ individuals worldwide proves to be a more challenging task. In the United States, there is a range between 4.4% of adults (Newport, 2018) and 11.2% of secondary school-aged youth (Kann et al., 2016) who have self-reported as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In 2015, the Organization for Refuge, Asylum, &   22 Migration (ORAM) estimated that approximately 2.5% of the world’s population are LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex) living in persecutory environments (ORAM, 2015). Of this projected 175 million individuals, 350,000 are anticipated to be either threatened or seriously harmed while in their country of origin while fewer than 1% of those individuals (2,500) have resettled and been granted legal protection thereby (ORAM, 2015). Likewise, it is very challenging to attempt to quantify the current number of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers globally.  Utilizing the United States ranges of 4.4% to 11.2% of potential LGBTQ individuals and applying that to the total number of global refugees and asylum seekers cited above (28 million) results in a potential range of 1.2 to 3.1 million LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. However, this does not take into consideration the numbers of LGBTQ individuals who have not entered the formal refugee and asylum-seeking processes due to credible fear of continued persecution.   In summary, this chapter explored the context and current landscape of suicide for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers that was situated in the broader context of suicide in the United States, amongst LGBTQ individuals, and refugees and asylum seekers. Additionally, idioms of distress were explored to provide a cultural context for which distress may be experienced and expressed. Global experiences of oppression in LGBTQ individuals was explored from both a historical perspective as well as present day in different global regions. Human rights law related to LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers was explored at length to provide additional context. Together, this chapter provides a critical foundation for which to understand the experiences of oppression that LGBTQ individuals experience. In the next chapter, a theoretical framework is presented   23 for conceptualizing experiences and cumulative risk factors of suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers across a lifespan trajectory.       24 Chapter 3: Theoretical Framework  Three theoretical perspectives have been identified in the construction of this theoretical framework for conceptualizing experiences and cumulative risk factors of suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers across a lifespan trajectory. Cumulative disadvantage theory is the overarching paradigm for this theoretical framework that explains the complex nature of cumulative trauma on an LGBTQ individual’s later self-concept and regulation, starting with the experiences of childhood adversity and leading through pre/post migration experiences. Childhood adversity and complex post-traumatic stress are described in detail as illustrations of cumulative disadvantage theory from the beginning of the lifespan. Minority stress theory represents the types of stigma and trauma the individual may then experience related directly to their coming out or perceived sexuality or gender identity across system levels that may then result in suicidality. Queer migration theory serves as a bridging theory that demonstrates the importance of the LGBTQ individuals’ identity and self-concept in relation to their traumatic pre-migration and migration experiences.   Together, these theories attempt to explain the potential accumulation of suicide risk factors that LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers may experience across their lifespans and throughout resettlement. The following sections outline these theories as well as present evidence in the literature related to broader problem identification and practice recommendations that may be applied to more unique experiences of suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers.     25 Cumulative Disadvantage Theory  Cumulative disadvantage theory (or cumulative inequality theory) underscores the impact that early advantages or disadvantages may have on short- and long-term outcomes (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2003). Ferraro and Shippee (2009) detailed five characteristics or axioms of cumulative disadvantage: • “Axiom 1: Social systems generate inequality, which is manifested over the life course through demographic and developmental processes. • Axiom 2: Disadvantage increases exposure to risk, but advantage increases exposure to opportunity. • Axiom 3: Life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency. • Axiom 4: The perception of life trajectories influences subsequent trajectories. • Axiom 5: Cumulative inequality may lead to premature mortality; therefore, nonrandom selection may give the appearance of decreasing inequality in later life” (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009).  Fundamentally, this theory postulates that disadvantage that occurs in one life domain, particularly early in life, increases the likelihood that further disadvantage or negative outcomes may happen both within that same life domain as well as potential increased risk in other areas of an individual’s life (Heap, Fors, & Lennartsson, 2017). When an individual has the agency or resilience to adapt to adversity, then there may not be a future risk or negative outcome (Schafer, Shippee, & Ferraro, 2009). However, when that agency is not present, risk may individual risk may hypothetically continue to accumulate. Since its introduction in the literature, cumulative disadvantage theory has   26 been increasingly included in sociological research, discussions of racial and ethnic disparities, social gerontology, and health and mental health outcomes (Crystal, Shea, & Reyes, 2017; Dannefer, 2003; Mcleod & Owens, 2004; Nurius, Prince, & Rocha, 2015).   Cumulative disadvantage theory is included in this theoretical framework as the paradigm in which to conceptualize potential cumulative risk from a lifespan trajectory perspective. Trauma, distress, and adversity that may occur in the lives of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers have both immediate impact as well as short-term and long-term negative outcomes. In the following sub-sections, childhood adversity and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) are presented to demonstrate how potential trauma from the start of the lifespan, childhood, can potentially cause increased risk of disadvantage (CPTSD and suicidality).  Childhood Adversity Child adversity is related to harmful developmental outcomes across a variety of domains and the lifespan (Kessler, Davis, & Kendler, 1997; Rudolph & Flynn, 2007; Strong et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2006). Numerous studies have examined types of childhood adversity (Evans et al., 2013; McLaughlin, 2016) that have included parental loss, familial disruption, issues related to poverty (McLaughlin, 2016), and various types of child maltreatment (St Clair et al., 2015). These studies have provided a foundation in the literature from which to understand the impact that different types of child maltreatment and childhood adversity can have on human growth and development. The concept of childhood adversity emerged to consider both the individual experiences of traumatic events as well the accumulation of these types of events that contribute to future negative outcomes, rather than a relationship between a single adverse event and a   27 single negative mental health outcome (Burgermeister, 2007). Contemporary research is directed toward exploring the association between childhood adversity and subsequent negative future developmental and health outcomes, including suicidality, to determine whether there is a differential impact in regard to the types of adversity experienced (McLaughlin, 2016).   There is evidence in the literature of studies examining associations between ACES and experiences of suicidality. In 2001, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study that examined the association between cumulative ACES experiences and increased suicide attempts. This study found that the risk of attempting suicide increased by 60% for every additional adverse childhood experience among 17,337 adults (Dube et al., 2001). The prevalence and exposure to ACES, coupled with a lack of protective factors, has been further associated with factors related to poor mental health outcomes, especially when exposed to traumatic stressors later in life (Ports et al., 2017). Evidence indicates that LGBTQ individuals who have experienced ACES are particularly prone to experiencing suicidality as well. A 2018 study of 4,955 high school students found that sexual minority youth with greater exposure to ACES experienced suicidal ideation and attempts at disproportionately higher levels than their straight counterparts (Clements-Nolle et al., 2018).  The examination of ACES as contributors to later poor mental health outcomes in refugees and asylum seekers is underrepresented in the literature. In a review of the literature, most studies examined the impact of human rights violations and war experiences as ACES in refugee and asylum-seeking youth (Hanes et al., 2017; Hart, 2009; Mehrabani, 2013). It is then novel to consider ACES as contributors to poor mental   28 health outcomes in refugees and asylum seekers overall but particularly with LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers and their unique experiences.  A study of by Opaas and Varin of 54 adult refugees resettled in Norway examined the impact of ACES relative to premigration experiences of human rights violations on their mental health and well-being. The results of this study indicated a high level of ACES among the adult refugee participants. Further, there was evidence that these experiences had directly contributed to their current symptoms of psychological distress (post-traumatic stress disorder). This was true even when controlling for the human rights violations that they had experienced (Opaas & Varvin, 2015). Alessi and colleagues (2016) explored the impact of ACES on the premigration mental health of 26 LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Findings from this study indicated that participants associated their adverse childhood experiences with a host of poor mental health outcomes, including suicidal ideation and attempts.  This body of evidence suggests that ACES may contribute to short-term and long-term experiences of distress and potential suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Likewise, ACES may contribute to cumulative risk factors and disadvantage from early in the lifespan for individuals to experience a lifetime of unique pressures, trauma, risk, and CPSTD.  Complex Post-Traumatic Stress  There has been an emergence within the literature recognizing the complexities in which individuals experience trauma and how these complexities impact their lives and functioning. In 2018, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) formally recognized Complex Post-  29 Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) within its diagnostic body of knowledge (Hyland et al., 2018). While symptoms of the original post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) must be present (symptoms related to fear or the re-experiencing of the memories of trauma), Cloitre and colleagues described CPTSD as having “three additional diagnostic features that reflect the impact that trauma can have on systems of self-organization, specifically problems in affective, self-concept, and relational domains” (Cloitre et al., 2013, p. 2). Further, these symptoms can present across different relationships, situations, and contexts that an individual experiences regardless of their similarity or closeness to their original traumatic reminder or event (Cloitre et al., 2013). CPTSD is rooted in traumatic events that stem from prolonged trauma and interpersonal violence that can include more direct forms of abuse, neglect, and intimate partner violence as well as larger structural trauma like war, torture, and exploitation (Mahoney, Karatzias, & Hutton, 2019).  Recent studies with refugees and asylum seekers have contributed to the understanding of CPTSD with vulnerable populations. A 2018 study by Hyland and colleagues described the presence of PTSD and CPTSD in 110 Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. They found a significantly higher prevalence of CPTSD (36.1%) in the refugee sample than of PTSD (25.2%). This study was significant in that it not only provided evidence for effective discrimination between PTSD and CPTSD, but it demonstrated that the ICD-11 model for CPTSD may work with diverse vulnerable populations. Further, it emphasized the acknowledgment of potential disturbances in self-organization, which makes CPSTD unique from PTSD (Hyland et al., 2018).   Further, Alessi and colleagues conceptualized the experiences of CPTSD in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers to be rooted in the cumulative nature of severe   30 trauma and traumatic events from childhood (Alessi & Kahn, 2017; Alessi, Kahn, & Chatterji, 2016). The experience of these specific types of trauma from an early development period lead to differentiated and more severe trauma later on than that of single-event trauma (Cloitre et al., 2009). For LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers, this is particularly notable as evidence indicates that they may experience severe cumulative trauma in their childhoods (Alessi & Kahn, 2017). Likewise, it is important to understand the nature of childhood adversity and adverse childhood experiences (ACES) and their relationship to the LGBTQ refugees’ and asylum seekers’ navigation of traumatic events as well as their contribution to disparate mental health outcomes including suicidality.  Minority Stress Model  The minority stress model (Meyer, 2003) is critical to understanding the context in which LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers experience their identity development and how they perceive their relationships and experiences with the world around them. The minority stress model asserts the following four experienced processes: • traumatic or stressful events involving prejudice, • the expectation of experiencing stigma, • the internalization of homophobia, and • concealment of sexual orientation (Meyer, 2003). Likewise, the minority stress model posits that the mental health disparities that LGBTQ individuals face are attributable to their exposure to stigma and discrimination. This stigma can be defined as perceptions and experiences of prejudice and discrimination in a hostile environment that lends itself to the development of chronic stress and health problems, including suicidal thoughts and actions (Burton et al., 2013).    31 The impact of stigma may be particularly evident within the family system. In 2009, Ryan and colleagues at the Family Acceptance Project reported that level of family acceptance for LGBTQ children was a very significant indicator for mental health outcomes. They found that LGBQ young individuals who experienced rejection from their families were almost 9 times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers who either experienced low or no levels of family rejection (Ryan et al., 2009). LGBTQ people also experience stigma through experiences of prejudice as they navigate throughout their families and society (Burton et al., 2013). After experiencing these types of stigma, the individual responds to such behaviors with “vigilance, expectations of prejudice, identity concealment for self-protection, and internalization of stigma” (Walch et al., 2016, p. 38). In turn, there is evidence that in addition to structural- and institutional-based stigma, greater individual exposure to these negative experiences of prejudice and discrimination is associated with greater psychological distress (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Additionally, the regions in which sexual minority individuals live also contribute to varying levels of structural and institutional discrimination and stigma they experience (Walch et al., 2016). Likewise, acknowledging the social origin, process, and impact of this structural and institutional stigma allows for greater insight into how it impacts LGBTQ individuals (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013), especially through poorer mental health outcomes (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and dysthymia) (Hatzenbuehler, Keyes, & Hasin, 2009).  There has been research to examine components of the minority stress model in relation to suicidality as well. An example of one such study yielded results of sexual minority youth being 1.7 times more likely to be assaulted while in school and 2.4 times   32 more likely to have avoided going to school due to their fear of assault than their heterosexual peers (Friedman et al., 2011).In turn, this type of victimization is associated with a 5 to 6 times higher likelihood of attempting suicide compared to sexual minority individuals who have not experienced the same heightened levels of victimization (Burton et al., 2013).   The minority stress model can provide a context for understanding the stigma and risk factors that LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers experience as a result of their perceived or identified sexual orientation or gender identity. This model takes into consideration the multilevel stressors that LGBTQ individuals experience and the subsequent impact that this may have in contributing to health and mental health disparities (Gowin et al., 2017) including aforementioned complex PTSD (Alessi & Kahn, 2017) and suicidality.  The experience of stigma may not occur solely within the realm of premigration victimization. Even after migration, LGBTQ individuals (asylum seekers in particular) may experience an intersection of stressors related to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity but also the stressors and trauma of migration and of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class (Alessi, 2016; Logie et al., 2016). These stressors include experiencing potential assaults (verbal, physical, and sexual), unstable living situations and environments, ongoing fear for safety and security, and the concealment of undocumented status (Gowin et al., 2017). These stressors compound with the challenges of dealing with the asylum process and navigating resettlement (Alessi & Kahn, 2017).  All these factors related to the minority stress model may have the potential to increase stress and contribute to poor mental health outcomes including potential   33 experiences of suicidality. Likewise, experiences framed under this model may also continue to contribute to the aggregate of suicide risk factors experienced by LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers across the lifespan.  Queer Migration Theory  The concept of queer migration is rooted in the idea that the polices, practices, and projection of experiences surrounding migration studies are heteronormative by nature, thus excluding or suppressing the experiences of LGBTQ individuals (Luibhéid, 2008).Therefore, queer migration theory reconfigures this paradigm to allow for a state of being in both time and geography that allows for more than space and time as the primary factors associated with the understanding of migration and includes intersections of diversity and social membership in identities and settlement narratives (Luibhéid, 2008).  Queer migration theory includes the way individuals’ bodies and movements are perceived as well as the impact that heteronormativity plays in reinforcing stigma by upholding the more traditional values that dictate societal interaction and functioning (Murray, 2014). This inclusion of such language as the individuals’ bodies and movements is critical as it is a method of shaping the narratives of LGBTQ (or queer-identified) individuals through their own stories of intimacy and trauma (White, 2014) rather than from a perspective or framework that is heteronormative by nature or unfamiliar to their experiences.  Likewise, queer migration politics seeks to further challenge the traditional normative perspective by including the intersections of LGBTQ/queer rights and justice from the voices and perspectives of diverse individuals themselves, including women of   34 color, queer-identified individuals, and others whose voices are typically unheard in the dominant discourse (Chavez, 2013). Further, queer migration theory provides a space for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers to share their own experiences in their words, rather than attempting to configure their story into a way that fits the expectations of the dominant culture to which they are seeking asylum and refuge (Ormsbee, 2006). On a macro level, “queer politics by LGBT activists and human rights groups” should then focus on “contesting the excluding and problematizing nature of such fixed, politically instrumentalized notions in the international community, including the UN and the EU” (Picq & Thiel, p.14) and other influential systems and policies. At this time, there is no data that can quantify the impact that this identity recognition can have on LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers specifically. However, there is very recent data demonstrating that when LGBTQ youth have at least one adult who is accepting of their identity, they are 40% less likely to report a suicide attempt than their at-risk counterparts who reported that they did not have at least one accepting adult (The Trevor Project, 2019). In this regard, the knowledge and application of the tenets of queer migration theory can serve as a critical protective factor. This trusting relationship and recognition of identity, from a queer migration theoretical perspective, could likely serve as a protective factor for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers as well.  Theoretical Framework Integration The integration of these three theoretical perspectives has the potential to have profound impact on the way we understand the experiences of suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Cumulative disadvantage theory acknowledges the impact of cumulative complex and compounded trauma from a lifespan perspective, thereby   35 helping to explain how trauma and adversity can contribute to poor mental health outcomes including CPTSD and suicidality. The minority stress model can then explain the experiences of stigma and prejudice across system levels during both premigration victimization and resettlement and how these experiences might also contribute to cumulative risk. Queer migration theory yields the recognition that the experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers – their historical traumas, their migration journeys, and their individual identities – are theirs to define. Having this identity and experience honored by trusted individuals can then serve as a protection against experiences of suicidality.  This integrated theoretical framework can serve as a paradigm that helps researchers, providers, and advocates contextualize their experiences, the methods by which we assess for suicide risk, and the mode of delivering culturally relevant interventions therein. Further, this framework provides a context that can be used to honor the identities, the experiences, and the triumphs of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers along their journeys.  In summary, this background chapter presented a framework for understanding factors contributing to suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers from a lifespan perspective. Factors related to suicidality, global oppression, and human rights were examined to provide context to the extent of the problem of suicidality among this vulnerable population. A framework was then provided that not only provided context by which to understand the unique contributing factors to suicidality across the lifespan of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers but also a culturally relevant paradigm in which to   36 process these findings. In the next chapter, the methodological approach to this dissertation will be discussed at length.            37 Chapter 4: Methodology The purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive review of the methodological approach to this qualitative inquiry for understanding the experiences of suicidality, trauma, and distress of LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The qualitative research design and thematic analysis are described in this section. Further, this section will also include a detailed description of the research questions, parent study, data analysis plan, trustworthiness, ethical considerations, and study limitations. Research Question The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the following research question: RQ: How do the experiences of stress and trauma of LGBTQ refugees and asylees shape their experiences of suicidality? Research Design According to Leung (2015), “the essence of qualitative research is to make sense of and recognize patterns among words in order to build up a meaningful picture without compromising its richness and dimensionality”. Qualitative research methodology allows the researcher to delve into and explore the insights, experiences and lived realities of their research participants (Austin & Sutton, 2014). In doing so, qualitative research methodology has the potential to get at the heart of the individual’s experiences, particularly with people from marginalized and underrepresented populations. This can be particularly useful for exploring research and knowledge areas that are not accessible or relevant for quantitative inquiry, focusing more on why a phenomenon has occurred than its frequency (Power, 2002).    38 A qualitative approach to this inquiry is appropriate due to the lack of literature related to suicidality and distress with LGBTQ refugees and asylees. This unique intersection of identity, trauma, and vulnerability has not been adequately explored. Likewise, qualitative inquiry would allow for the examination of the experiences of suicidality that LGBTQ refugees and asylees reported in a way that honors their experiences by examining their stories through their subjective experiences and allowing for potential themes or commonalities to emerge organically.  The Researcher The researcher has been a social work professional for the past 13 years and has earned a BSW from Shepherd University and an MSW from University of Maryland, Baltimore. The researcher has been trained in advanced qualitative research methods. First, this researcher received qualitative cross-cultural research training in the School of Social Work at University of Maryland, Baltimore. Next, the researcher received advanced qualitative research methodology training in his doctoral studies in the School of Social Work at the Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work at Florida International University in Miami, FL. Since 2009, he has been a contracted social work trainer who has integrated evidence-based research into various practice modalities for social work and allied professionals in child welfare, pediatrics, and LGBTQ and HIV serving social service and non-profit agencies. The principal investigator of the parent study is Dr. Edward Alessi. Dr. Alessi is Associate Professor and Chancellor’s Scholar of LGBTQ Mental Health, Trauma, and Resilience at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. He is the preeminent social work researcher in LGBTQ forced migration studies and holds an MSW degree from   39 Columbia University, a PhD in Clinical Social Work from New York University, and completed the Summer Institute in LGBT Population Health, a prestigious training fellowship through The Fenway Institute and Boston University School of Public Health.  Regarding this study, there is no conflict of interest related to the researcher and any study participant that may have resulted in bias. As this study is a secondary data analysis, the researcher has no relationship with any study participant or any knowledge of their identities, countries or origin, or means of contact. The researcher does not identify as a refugee or an asylee. The researcher does identify within the LGBTQ community and is interested in exploring expressions of suicidality and distress among LGBTQ refugees and asylees in part due to his own historical experiences of oppression for being LGBTQ. The researcher recognizes that his historical experiences of oppression and suicidality, if left unacknowledged, could influence bias in the study. Likewise, the researcher, under the supervision of the dissertation chair, will periodically check-in to discuss how these experiences may be influencing the nature of the data analysis. Parent Study  The following is a description of the parent study. This description includes the purpose of the parent study, sampling and recruitment, study participant demographics, data collection, and a synthesis of the findings. This information is extracted from three articles published by the original research team (Alessi, 2016; Alessi et al., 2016, 2017). Purposes of Parent Study  The parent study examined three domain areas related to the experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The experiences of childhood trauma were explored among LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) individuals who later gained protected   40 status in the United States and Canada. This study focused on how participants described their experiences of childhood and adolescent abuse as well as how they described the impact of this abuse on their mental health before they migrated. Experiences of premigration were explored due to the lack of empirical research within the literature related to premigration victimization experiences unique to LGBT forced migrants. Contributing factors to resilience were also explored in this study of participants who were resettled in the United States and Canada (Alessi, 2016; Alessi et al., 2016, 2017). Sampling and Recruitment Purposeful sampling is often used in qualitative research for identifying relevant, appropriate participants and rich data sources for study selection, particularly in the midst of limited resources (Palinkas et al., 2015; Patton, 2002). The parent study “engaged in purposive sampling through the following avenues: (a) community organizations offering social and legal services to LGBT forced migrants living in New York and Toronto; (b) the listservs of these community organizations, which included members residing in various parts of the United States and Canada; (c) a Facebook page that provided details about the study; (d) community events for LGBT forced migrants (fundraising dance, advocacy meetings); and (e) referrals from participants who completed a study interview” (Alessi, 2016). Recruitment of participants from diverse countries of origin was purposeful to provide a broad context for understanding these shared experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Inclusion criteria included being 18 years of age or older and official refugee or asylum status on the basis of a particular social membership group (sexual orientation or gender identity) for at least one month prior to the individual   41 interview. The participants were preliminarily screened via telephone by the research team for study participation.  Study Participants  The following is a description of the study participants. “The final sample consisted of 26 participants who obtained asylee (n = 14), refugee (n = 10), or withholding-of-removal status (n = 2) in the United States (n = 16) or Canada (n = 10). Participants were granted status between 2005 and 2014 and were between the ages of 21 and 49 (M = 33). They emigrated from Barbados (n = 1), Belarus (n = 1), Jamaica (n = 5), Iran (n = 4), Kenya (n = 2), Kosovo (n = 1), Malaysia (n = 1), Nicaragua (n = 1), Nigeria (n = 1), Peru (n = 1), Russia (n = 3), South Korea (n = 1), Trinidad (n = 1), Uganda (n = 1), Ukraine (n = 1), and Venezuela (n = 1). Participants identified as gay (n = 20), lesbian (n = 2), transgender male (n = 2), and transgender female (n = 2). Racially they identified as Black (n = 10), White (n = 10), Hispanic/Latino (n = 3), Asian (n = 2), and multiracial (n = 1). They resided in the Northeastern or Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and in the Canadian province of Ontario” (Alessi et al., 2017). Data Collection   Interviews for the parent study were conducted from September 2014 – April 2015. These interviews lasted approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours in length. These individual interviews were conducted, recorded, and transcribed by the research team. Three of these interviews were conducted in Farsi utilizing a qualified and trained Farsi interpreter, who simultaneously translated interview questions and prompts and interpreted participant responses. Only  English translations were transcribed verbatim in the Farsi interviews. These interviews occurred in-person (n=17), via Skype (n=8), and   42 by phone (n=1). Three (n=3) of the interviews were conducted in Farsi in the presence of an interpreter. All other interviews were conducted in English. The interview protocol was a semi-structured format. Participants were interviewed utilizing a life history interview format, which discussed early childhood, coming out, premigration victimization, and resettlement experiences (but not experiences of suicidality specifically). A copy of this semi-structured interview protocol will be requested the data sharing agreement and will be included as an appendix in the final dissertation.  For questions related to childhood abuse, additional questions were adapted from a screening tool developed by D’Aguelli et al. (2006). Follow up questions related to mental health issues and treatment for the participants in their country of origin (Alessi et al., 2016). When exploring questions related to premigration victimization, the parent study asked such questions related to experiences of daily violence experienced, and interactions with police or government officials. Questions were asked such as the following: “In your country of origin, were you ever called names, teased, or threatened with being hurt because you were LGBT or people thought you were LGBT? Did you have any interactions with police or government officials (Alessi et al., 2016)?” English speaking participants were contacted a week from their interview as a follow up to “elicit participants’ feelings about the life-history interview and allow them the opportunity to share additional information” Alessi et al, 2016, p.939).  Questions related to resilience were adapted from the literature on resilience, including work by Singh and colleagues (Singh & McKleroy, 2011; Singh et al., 2011). These questions included the following: “How do you deal with difficult times and experiences? How did you bounce back (Alessi, 2016)?” All interviews were de-identified by name, country of origin, and any   43 other distinguishing factor or characteristic. Researchers in the parent study conducted life history interviews which asked participants about their childhoods and pre/post migration experiences (Alessi, 2016; Alessi et al., 2016, 2017). Parent Study Findings The parent study yielded findings related to childhood and adolescent abuse, premigration victimization, and resilience that resulted in three peer-reviewed journal publications. Regarding childhood and adolescent abuse, the parent study found emergent themes of abuse by parents, caregivers, peers, and school personnel. Implications of that abuse was the themes of feeling that there was nowhere to turn for support and the resulting psychological distress. When participants described their premigration victimization, they discussed “living on the edge”, adopting concealment strategies, victimization that was routine in nature, and experiences of having individuals who were identified as their protectors who were also their perpetrators. An exploration of factors related to resilience revealed that participants discussed staying hopeful and positive, utilizing community and legal services, relying on support from significant others and friends, doing what it took to survive, and the experiences of giving back to others in need (Alessi, 2016; Alessi et al., 2016, 2017). The present dissertation builds upon these findings by exploring the nature of the participants experiences of suicidality as well as more closely examine how the participants describe their experiences trauma and distress.  Study Procedures  The researcher made a data sharing agreement for access to the original study transcripts with Dr. Edward Alessi, the owner of the parent study data set. The researcher has been granted approval to utilize the de-identified transcript data for the purposes of   44 the inquiry related to the research questions established within this dissertation study. The researcher received the data as individual Microsoft Word documents via a secure email file from the owner and stored them on a password secure computer. This study was approved by the FIU Institutional Review Board. Thematic Analysis Methodology  Data from this study was analyzed using thematic analysis. Braun and Clarke (2006) define thematic analysis is a qualitative form of data analysis that is used for “identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data” (p. 79). Likewise, thematic analysis can used for the purpose of reporting “experiences, meanings and the reality of participants” (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 81).  Braun and Clarke (2006) identified inductive and theoretical analyses as two thematic analysis approaches. An inductive analysis approach to thematic analysis is where the emergent themes will be directly linked to the data themselves (Patton, 2002) rather than being tied specifically to the interests or theoretical perspectives the researcher may have on the topic (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A theoretical analysis approach would then be conceptualized as being motivated by the researcher’s interests and theoretical perspectives and, in turn, focusing effort on analyzing certain areas of the data in relation to those preconceived interests and perspectives (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Although this dissertation study has identified one guiding research questions related to experiences of suicidality and distress, the data analysis approach employed was inductive in nature in order to capture themes that may not have been identified from a more deductive approach.     45 Data Analysis  This study was conducted via secondary data analysis. Secondary analysis is the utilization of existing data for the purpose of seeking answers to questions that were different from those of the original study (Szabo & Strang, 1997; Tripathy, 2013). Inductive thematic analysis was performed to explore for concepts and themes that emerge from the data that may then contribute to the identified research questions. The transcripts were inherited from the data owner via Microsoft Word documents and loaded into the data analysis program by the researcher. The researcher is trained in ATLAS.ti qualitative research software  The data analysis plan for this dissertation employed multiple iterative phases of analysis through the transcripts. The data analysis procedure integrated concepts identified by appropriate qualitative analysis references (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Rubin & Babbie, 2016; Saldaña, 2013; Strauss, 1984) as well as consultation with the dissertation committee faculty. There were four steps in the data analysis process which were adapted from the Braun and Clarke (2006) phases of thematic analysis through consultation with a committee member with qualitative analysis expertise. These steps included the preliminary phase of transcript review and three subsequent analysis phases (Braun & Clarke, 2006). They are detailed in Figure 1.    46 Figure 1. Data Analysis Process.   The following is the detailed data analysis procedure for this dissertation study that moves from the preliminary phase of analysis through phase three. Preliminary Phase  The preliminary phase of data analysis began with the initial reading of all 26 interview transcripts. A researcher log was kept at this time that documented overall impressions and reflections made by the researcher during the transcript reading experience in the form of journaling and analytic memos. This practice of ongoing reflection was helpful to the researcher in monitoring reactions and feelings related to reading the details of participant trauma and, in turn, served as a tool for ongoing processing with the dissertation chair for maintaining study trustworthiness. Preliminary code and code group identification occurred at this time as well.    Preliminary Phase•Reviewed transcripts; Developed researcher logsFirst Phase •Free codingSecond Phase •Code groupingThird Phase •Theme generation   47 First Phase  The first phase of coding consisted of open coding each of the 26 transcripts. This coding occurred in ATLAS.ti qualitative research software. A code is “a term for any product of this analysis, whether category or a relation among two or more categories” (Strauss, 1984). Further, Saldaña explains that “a code in qualitative inquiry is most often a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence-capturing, and/or evocative attribute for a portion of language-based or visual data” (Saldaña, 2013, p.3). This coding is heuristic in nature in that it is more than just labeling; it is what will link the data together to provide deeper insight and meaning through emergent themes and patterns (Saldaña, 2013).  In this first phase of iterative analysis, liberal, open coding was employed (Ford et al., 2000; Richards & Richards, 1995) to allow for as many different codes to be identified as possible through closely examining the data (Rubin & Babbie, 2016). Rubin and Babbie go further to provide a definition of open coding derived from Strauss and Corbin (1994) as “the part of the analysis that pertains specifically to the naming and categorizing of phenomena through close examination of the data… [by] breaking the data down in to discrete parts, closely examined, compared for similarities and differences” (Rubin & Babbie, 2016, p. 363; Corbin & Strauss, 1990). The process of forming code labels began through the iterative process of analyzing the first 3 transcripts and continued throughout the duration of free coding. A researcher log was maintained to track analytic memos, researcher reflections, and codes. The first phase of coding was supervised by the dissertation chair.   48 During first phase coding, steps were implemented to increase trustworthiness and guard against confirmation bias. Negative case analysis began at this time. As patterns emerged the researcher sought cases which might defy or negate the pattern (Lincoln & Guba, 1986; Padgett, 2016). Constant comparison was also be performed by both revisiting earlier transcripts to see if later developed codes could apply to them, as well as to ensure code names are used in the same way throughout transcripts (Dye et al., 2000; Strauss, 1984). Researcher logs and ATLAS.ti coding documents were shared with the dissertation chair for review at the following intervals of completed transcripts: 5, 13, and 26. The researcher continued engaging in ongoing reflection with the dissertation chair to process feelings that arose throughout the free coding process related to personal reactions from continually reading traumatic details from participant stories. This continued to ensure trustworthiness in data analysis through the recognition of elicited feelings and mitigation against potential researcher subjectivity.  Second Phase  The second phase of analysis was primarily working with the codes and grouping them. This phase of analysis utilized more complex, abstract codes. These code groups were then utilized for code categorization.  Third Phase  Themes emerge in phase three. Braun and Clark (2006) described themes as capturing “something important about the data in relation to the research question, and represents some level of patterned response or meaning within the data set” as well as “whether it captures something important in relation to the overall research question”   49 (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 82). In 2018, they clarified the function that themes serve. They describe themes as different than simple summaries of participant responses about a specific domain. They then depict themes as “key characters in the story we are telling about the data… [having their own] ‘essence’ or core concept that underpins and unites the observations” (Clarke & Braun, 2018, p. 107). Thematic networks were created utilizing the network visualization tool ATLAS.ti. In networks, codes were organized in groups based upon their shared characteristics. Attride-Stirling (2001) described thematic networks as a tool utilized for organization of data within qualitative inquiry, creating “a web-like network as an organizing principle and a representational means” (p.388). Ultimately, these networks are “then represented as web-like maps depicting the salient themes at each of the three levels, and illustrating the relationships between them” (Attride-Stirling, 2001, p. 388).  Trustworthiness  In this dissertation study, negative case analysis (Lincoln & Guba, 1986) and constant comparison (Dye et al, 2000) were performed.  This study attempted to ensure as well as acknowledge issues related to trustworthiness through the following measures. In the parent study, the trained research team engaged in in-depth individual interviews with study respondents and peer debriefing. In the current secondary analysis, the researcher actively engaged in  negative case analysis; constant comparison, providing evidence and thick descriptive data when reporting study results; and external auditing under the supervision of the dissertation committee (Lincoln & Guba, 1986).     50 Ethical Considerations  Steps have been taken to ensure ethical considerations within this study. From the parent study, the research team was careful and considerate regarding the sensitivities and vulnerabilities of their study participants by ensuring their safety during study participation and anonymity in data transcription and recording (Peter, 2015). Further, the participants’ autonomy was taken into consideration through informed consent while their beneficence were guaranteed through such practices as pseudonym utilization and regular check-ins to ensure comfort with the interview process (Orb et al., 2001). Likewise, ethical considerations will continue to be ensured within the present study on behalf of the original study participants.   In summary, this chapter provided an in-depth examination of the methodological approach to this dissertation study. In doing so, the qualitative research design and data analysis methodology were detailed as well as the research questions, parent study, data analysis plan, trustworthiness, ethical considerations, and study limitations. The subsequent chapters of this dissertation will present the study results and discuss implications for theory and social work.           51 Chapter 5: Findings  The purpose of this chapter is to describe the findings of this dissertation study through the exploration of the following research question: RQ: How do the experiences of distress and trauma of LGBTQ refugees and asylees shape their experiences of suicidality? Likewise, this chapter details the study findings through the presentation of each identified theme along with supporting participant interview vignettes. The following themes were identified: internal and interpersonal support, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. They are detailed in Figure 2.  Figure 2. Study Themes.       52 Internal and Interpersonal Supports Seven participants of diverse regional and cultural backgrounds mentioned contemplating features of suicidality at one point in their lives. Courage, resilience, and the importance of human relationships and connection emerged as central components of this theme of protective support factors.  Courage and Resilience Chris, a gay man from Asia, described his contemplation of suicidality in relation to both his personal definition of resilience as well as his sense of connection through the relationships with people in his life. Eli, a gay man from the Middle East, recounts his contemplation of suicide through a lens of courage. He went on further to describe his thinking about suicide in relation to his wanting to survive his current situation but not knowing how to do so.  Interviewer (Q): So this is even before the event with the police where you got arrested.  So it’s a long time.  And did you ever try to hurt yourself, kill yourself? Eli (A): I was thinking about it. Q: You were thinking about it? A: And I could say that I didn’t have the courage to do that.   Q: Why is it—what about that you had the courage to live? A: What was the question? Q: How about reframing it, it sounds like you had the courage to live? A: I was trying to find a way to survive and have a better life, but I didn’t know how.      53 Importance of Human Relationships and Connection  This connection to friendship and human relationships continued with Stephen, a gay man from the Eastern Europe/Northern Asia region. He also described the importance of human relationships and connection through friendship as the determining factor in his own suicidal contemplation. His connection with a female friend made the difference after the experiencing intense bullying and negativity he received from his peers in his childhood. Interviewer: And um, did you have any friends besides girls? Stephen: No, no, no. Like guys were afraid to be friends with me just because they were thinking they could get in trouble too, there could be rumors about us, and they could get beaten up the way I did. I only had one friend and it was a girl and um so I hang out with her and I’m extremely grateful for having a friend because if I didn’t have a friend around that time I probably wouldn’t be here now. Interviewer: Mmm. What do you mean? Stephen: Um, it was very tough at times. You know like the thrash that I was experiencing from the side of my peers and um I was thinking about ending it all on numerous occasions.  Hasti, a transgender woman from the Middle East, described her thoughts related to suicidality in more indirect terms. She named her mother as being the presence in her life that kept her from following through with any suicidal actions.  Interviewer (Q): Have you ever tried to hurt yourself or take your life? Hasti (A):  No. Q:  Do you think about that?   54 A:  I think, yeah, I was thinking, but the way that I would wish that I hope I sleep tonight and I’m not waking up in the morning.  But, no, I am afraid of killing myself. Q:  But you don’t want to hurt yourself? A:  And I—if I didn’t have mother in this world, maybe I would do so, but, no.   For Ricardo, a gay man from South America, it was his former Scoutmaster and current friends as the people in his life who were able to support him during his time of suicidal contemplation.  Ricardo: and I put a lot of questions forth at the time. I was still talking to my Scoutmaster, even though I wasn’t part of the troop anymore. He and I had remained good friends. And so I would come forward, you know, with ‘maybe this is what’s going on.’ I still count on him as a friend I can talk to about a lot of these issues. And the, well, the isolation of the apartment didn’t really help me much, but then the fact that I had new friends and it was a little better than it was the first term, you know, actually removed the contemplation of suicide at the time. Interviewer: Right, right. And did you actually try to commit suicide? Ricardo: I had planned it, but I remember planning it, but not getting quite close to it. Secondary Exposure to Trauma Secondary exposure to trauma is defined as “the widespread phenomenon of indirect exposure to different types of traumatic material, such as contacts with people who have experienced traumatic events, exposure to graphic trauma content (e.g.,   55 reported by the survivor), exposure to people’s cruelty to one another, and observation of and participation in traumatic reenactments” (Cieslak et al., 2013; Pearlman & Saakvitne, 1995). The inference of causality or correlation with participant suicide risk in relation to this secondary exposure to suicidality is outside the scope of this present study. However, it is notable that six study participants were able to identify individuals who were experience suicidal contemplation and attempts in their social networks/informal relationships while they were navigating the terrain of their asylum journeys. Since these study participants were having their own experiences of trauma along their asylum and resettlement journeys, this may have been another layer of stress for them as they reported feeling compelled or responsible for caring for these individuals.  Suicide in Informal Relationships. Six participants described having experienced suicidality through their informal relationships. Three key social networks that emerged: friendships, intimate relationships, and fellow asylees.  Friendships. Two participants described having close friends who experienced suicidality. Nima, a gay man from the Middle East, recounted the story of his transgender friend who had died by suicide. Her death was a turning point for Nima in that it inspired him to activism and ultimately led to his refugee journey.  Nima (A): I had one transgender friend that I found her after a while, after a long time of feeling that I’m the only person in the world with these feelings. Interviewer (Q): Where did you find her? I: Through one of my friends. And unfortunately after two months she committed   56 suicide and it was big on me, and I wanted to stop these actions.  I wanted to do something for my community. Q: Do you think if your friend didn’t commit suicide— I: Probably not. Q: You wouldn’t be here? I: Probably not.  Eduard, a gay man from the Eastern Europe/Northern Asia region, described wanting to be a strong support for his friend who “wants to commit suicide.” Although this individual is also a fellow asylee, this vignette emerged in the friendship category due to the close nature of their relationship. Eduard described his feelings of closeness and protection in the following: Eduard: Some of my friends, they suicidal. I mean they, I mean, I said some. One friend, he wants to commit suicide… he’s asylee… I’m very worried for him, yea. He’s been down and I’m so in everyday life, I’m trying to fix my things first. But you know, I want to cheer him up, you know give him advice. You know give him a book to read. You know just give a little something, you know… Interviewer: So you’re, you’re in a way, strength for him? Eduard: Yea. I’m, we are family, he’s my brother here, you know. He like, like I’m not like a bro type ::chuckle::. But I never had a brother, and he’s been my best friend for six years now. And like he knows everything about me, I know everything about him. And… Interviewer: So uh… Eduard: I feel like I am responsible.   57 Interviewer: For him? Eduard: Yea, I’m responsible for him. Intimate Relationships. Two participants described the impact of their former boyfriends’ suicide attempts on their lives. Ricardo, who had described contemplating his own suicide, described the experience where he was detained at the US/Canadian border with his boyfriend, who he had previously reported as a missing in San Francisco. This encounter was a result of his attempting to act upon hearing that his boyfriend was considering suicide. The encounter that he described elicited within him similar feelings of trauma and distress that he had felt upon being detained previously during his own asylum journey.  Ricardo: The situation deteriorated over time, and eventually it came to the point where he had a major breakdown, back in May, June, he threatened with suicide, and I took the threat seriously –  Interviewer: Wow, very difficult, very difficult.  Ricardo: – Um, his friends were coming forward and were telling me that he had said this and this and that, and when someone threats with suicide it shouldn’t be taken lightly, and so I reported him as a missing person to San Francisco Police Department. Eventually this had created an issue at the border, not in Canada but in the U.S., because he was reported as a missing person. We were surrounded by five officers around the car, and instructed to leave the car and walk with them inside. And I just thought, Oh, my God, Niagara Falls again, that’s exactly how I felt. I felt like I was going through the same horrible experience that I had endured in Niagara Falls in 2000. It wasn’t quite the case, you know, but he had   58 a major breakdown, he was crying. He was like, Why is this happening to me? And I said, well, this is what happens when you threaten yourself with suicide –  Dionysis also reflected upon the experience of suicidality with his then ex-boyfriend, who was currently imprisoned and accused of murdering two individuals. Dionysis described the feeling compelled to care for this person in spite of the heinous accusations that he was facing.  Dionysis: So my, my ex-boyfriend was accused of murdering two people. And apparently he didn’t remember anything. He was found next to them. He tried to commit suicide, many times, because he could not face what he had – Interviewer: Done… Dionysis: – apparently done. … Dionysis: I just know he need someone… Fellow Asylees. Two participants described suicidality amongst individuals that they had met along their asylum journeys. Cat, a gay man from the Caribbean, described a fellow asylee’s suicidality in relation to his own distress and contemplation. Interviewer (Q): Yea. Did you ever think of hurting yourself? Cat (A): It goes through my mind yes to hurt myself to get attention yea. Because this guy who got asylum he was suicidal and they put him on suicidal watch because It was stressful for him and to have to commit crime and, I was crying out. Q: For help.   59 A: Yea I was. For help. Q: You wanted someone to understand what was happening.  A: Yea just give me a helping hand. Paul, a gay man from Central America, endured continual traumatic events along his journey via coyote toward the US. Border, including being deported, extensive physical attacks, attempted homicide, extreme health issues, extortion, imprisonment by a Cartel, and sexual violence including being forced to fellate a dog in front of his captors. He recounted an experience with a fellow asylee who was also experiencing distress along their journey. He described escaping from his captures after being held hostage for 20 days. While in captivity, a fellow asylee begged him to kill her. He described pleading with her to trust that God would grant them freedom. Retraumatization Retraumatization has been defined as “one's reaction to a traumatic exposure that is colored, intensified, amplified, or shaped by one's reactions and adaptational style to previous traumatic experiences” (Danieli, 2010, p. 195). It has also been defined from a social work perspective as the following:  “a conscious or unconscious reminder of past trauma that results in a re-experiencing of the initial trauma event. It can be triggered by a situation, an attitude or expression, or by certain environments that replicate the dynamics (loss of power/control/safety) of the original trauma” (Zgoda et al., 2016, n.p.). From these definitions, retraumatization can be ultimately conceptualized in this study as the response that individuals experience related to a traumatic event after the event has occurred, where the response has been elicited by a trigger or reminder of the   60 original traumatic incident, and where the traumatic response experienced is as intense as the original response experienced at the time of the original trauma. Retraumatization emerged as a theme in this study through examining participants’ previous experiences of suicidality as privacy and trust in relation to the telling of their stories over and over.  Previous Experiences of Suicidality Five participants described attempting suicide at least once. These attempts ranged as early as during teenage years all the way through resettlement and up until less than a year before their participation in the parent study.  Emir, a gay man from the Middle East, mentioned this attempted experience took place within 10-11 months of his interview in the parent study. He described taking 12-13 benzodiazepines and locking himself in the bathroom of his apartment while his roommates were home, where he was then transported to the hospital and received psychiatric treatment for a week.  Emir (A):  I took the lorazepam, and because it was large tablets, I had to take, you know, two or three of them together.  I went to the washroom and locked myself in.  And my roommates find out and try to knock the door and open the door.  I didn’t, and one of them, I don’t know how, they opened the door and we were physically engaged and I punched his face and he beat me up as well and put his finger to my mouth and I threw it up. The other four study participants mentioned having at least two attempts in their lifetime. Stephen described cutting his wrists during his attempts at suicide.  Interviewer: Did you ever try to hurt yourself?   61 Stephen: Yes. Interviewer: How? What did you do? Stephen: I was thinking about cutting my wrists um several times and I actually tried a couple of times but I was not very successful. Brian, a gay man from Jamaica, described different methods for each of his attempts (cutting and overdosing on medication). His first attempt was during his teen years and the second took place in his resettlement. He did not receive immediate care for either of his attempts. For Chris, his two attempts were connected to his receiving care after his initial HIV diagnosis. He also described different methods for each attempt (cutting and overdosing “OD’ing” on medication), for which he received psychiatric treatment.  Interviewer: Have you ever tried to kill yourself? Chris: Yea. I cut myself. I cut myself by um, I tried to OD myself. Interviewer: When? Chris: Um the cutting part was last year um, a few weeks after I first got diagnosed um, because I couldn’t take going in and out of the health center so much, and you know the constant blood drawing and the constant you know, nonstop so. And feeling like I’m you know, just a pain in the ass for a lot of people you know, maybe I should just end it. I’m not being useful anyway. Um the OD’ing part was when I was in Taiwan. I tried to take all of my Celexa.     62 Chris also reported additional past experiences of self-injurious behavior during his description of his attempts. He stated I hit myself on the head also. I banged myself on the head, on tables, um I don’t know. Um sometimes I just black out.  Roman, a gay man from the Caribbean, mentioned having known he was depressed because he had two suicide attempts. In describing his first attempt, he mentioned how he did not have any relationship with his family. Roman: The first one was [pause] a little after I got this— Interviewer: Yes, when you were going into your apartment building?   Roman: Yes.  Some time after that I pretty much had a breakdown.  I had felt like [pause] like I wasn’t going anywhere.  This, you know, I’m constantly alone, I don’t have any relations with my family… Later in his interview, he discussed in-depth how he overdosed by taking a bottle of aspirin while at work and the subsequent medical treatment that occurred (pumping his stomach). This particular incident occurred after a breakup, which caused him significant distress.  Roman (A): So I went back to work and I just felt sad again.  I was like, the more—it was like I just felt like more hopeless and everything in my life I just amplified it and it just became over—a burden.  And it was like, “I can’t live like this, you know.  I can’t live like this.  You know, death would be [pause] much better.”  And I still have the aspirin, the bottle of aspirin.  And I just took them all.   Interviewer (Q): At work?     63 A: Yes.  [laughs] And [pause] I was there and I was sitting in my supervisor’s office and they were—we were going to have a sales meeting of some sort, and—but I was sitting there and they were like, “Oh let him,” I guess they were saying, “Let him sit there because he’s going through something.”  Well then the meeting started, I guess, and [pause] I could hear voices around me but I couldn’t open my eyes, I couldn’t do anything.  And [pause] I know somebody was shaking me and they’re like, “Wake up!  Wake up!”  and like.  And I guess I wasn’t responding and I could hear somebody like, “Oh my God he’s dead!”  [laughs] So [pause] I think someone was checking pulse and next thing I was being lifted and I could feel all this going on around me.   Q: Did they—you went to the hospital?   A: Oh yeah, I was rushed to the hospital.   Q: Did they pump your stomach?   A: Oh yes.  And that was not pleasant.  [laughs] Telling of Story Over and Over. Eight study participants discussed their experiences of sharing their traumatic stories over and over with different officials along their resettlement trajectories. For some study participants, the sharing and re-sharing their stories was not particularly impactful to them. However, others experienced major concerns related to their personal privacy, reliving of the trauma they had endured, and the distress they endured as a result of sharing their stories repeatedly. Codes for this theme included telling story over and over, telling intimate details of story, and distress in telling the story.    64 For Stephen, a gay man from Ukraine, the process of telling his story repeatedly did not elicit a strong response or emotional reaction. He explained:  I don’t really think it was that big of a deal to be honest. I mean I thought they were wanting to get the most detail about this and that. It was like I don’t, it wasn’t annoying. I knew it was part of the process so I like I was happy to do that. To do what was asked of me. However, several Black-identified participants discussed privacy and trust as central areas of distress related to the retelling of their stories. Tico, a gay man from Uganda, described the impact that the retelling of his story meant to his personal privacy. He described having to retell his story in ever new setting that was designed to help him.  Interviewer (Q): So you had to tell your story over and over huh? Tico (A): Yea. Q: After a while, what was that… A: After a while? Q: What was that like? I mean having to tell this story to immigration officials, attorneys… A: Yea. You know, sometimes you feel, you feel it’s too much. You feel like you being grilled and in return we have to tell everyone what happened to you. Sometimes I feel it should be your story. For example you have to see the psychiatrist, you have to see, you have to tell your story to the lawyer. And then you have to tell this story to all these social groups, those you need support.   65 Q: Oh, right! I didn’t even think of that. Then you have to meet the social workers, the group the therapist, the… A: It’s way too much. So they expect you to tell your story over and over again, over and over again. So sometimes if you’re not right, like you feel your privacy and stuff it’s just spread all over, everyone knows about your story so, yea. It’s not good sometimes.  Kaspar, a black-identified gender nonconforming trans man from the Caribbean, also discussed challenges with privacy and trust was when seeking assistance from members of his church in seeking asylum. He described what it was like to have to tell his reshare his story.  Yes. For the church. But, you know, there were other people that I really wished did not know. Cuz I’m a very private person as well. And so the immigration officer, when I went there, she – the way they operate is they ask you questions about your story and about yourself, but they do not take it in a particular order. They randomly ask questions. It’s my story so, any which way I could tell it. Back or front, you know I could just tell it. If you just asked me, I could tell you. So, she was very professional. I did not know whether or not she believed me or if I was going to get asylum.   Cat, also from the Caribbean, shared similar sentiments regarding privacy and trust, as well as why sharing his story was so emotional for him.  Joseph, a trans man from Africa, discussed privacy in relation to not only having to share his story repeatedly, but also to do so in front of his adult son.    66 Interviewer (Q):  Right, right. And I was gonna, I was gonna ask you, did you have to talk about things over and over again?  Joseph (A): Yes, now that caused me problems.  Q: I was gonna ask you, what’s that like, when you have to talk about things over and over again?  A: It was like reliving the same experience again and again, and the minute I [inaud], because I’m repeating the same thing. Q: Over and over.  A: That’s the one that I didn’t like at all.  Q: You didn’t like at all. And did you have to talk about things that were private, and difficult?  A: Very private, and sometimes I was talking with my adult son there.  Q: Oh, dear.  A: And that was like undressing me in public. Q: Wow. Did you, so, you had to talk about very private things with your eldest son there. And that was like – wow A: I never discussed my sexuality with anybody, not my son of all people, and he was there to hear my story. And I think that was the most uncomfortable thing.      Anebi, a gay man from Africa, described having to have a physical examination and being forced to reenact his sexual experiences in front of the interviewers to demonstrate consistency in his recounting of his story.  Private details like because I know Y, my lawyer had to send me to somewhere in the Bronx, it was a international something hospital something and they had to   67 ask me a lot of stuff like how did they beat, you have to demonstrate it on the floor, how were you groaning, how many men on you and the injuries on my body they had to check them out, took pictures, did some measurement and eventually my rib and other shoulder, I told them just to punch and check it out, the impact on that so you know I had to reveal the details like that because the immigration officers wanted all those details. If what you’re saying is consistent with what is there from your lawyer. So they needed all of that.  Conclusion  This chapter uniformly presented the findings of the dissertation study by research question and include the corresponding identified themes with supporting participant interview vignettes. The following themes were identified: internal and interpersonal support, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. The next chapter, Discussion, will include an interpretation of these findings are related to the parent study, the theoretical framework, and the larger body of knowledge related to LGBTQ refugees and asylees as well as a discussion of study limitations and implications.          68 Chapter 6: Discussion  The purpose of this chapter is to interpret the findings of this dissertation study through the exploration its research question: RQ: How do the experiences of distress and trauma of LGBTQ refugees and asylees shape their experiences of suicidality?  This chapter begins with an interpretation of the research findings that connects to the study’s theoretical framework as well as the existing body of knowledge related to the experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylees. This chapter also includes discussions of the study limitations, major implications for social work, and recommendations for future action.  Interpretation of Findings  The findings of this qualitative dissertation study yielded several emergent themes related to trauma, distress, and suicidality. The following themes were identified: internal and interpersonal support, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. The following is an interpretation of these findings that connects to the dissertation background and theoretical framework, the parent study, and the larger body of knowledge.   At present, this is one of the first empirical studies to formally document and explore suicidality as a centered topic of exploration with LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The background chapter of this dissertation synthesized public health findings and statistics related to suicidality in American LGBTQ adolescents (Adams et al., 2017; Centers for Disease Control, 2015; District of Columbia Office of the State   69 Superintendent of Education, 2017; Ost & Maurizi, 2013; The Trevor Project, 2019) and African refugees (Wasserman, 2017). While this evidence was able to provide a preliminary context for which to understand the potential degree of suicidality with LGBTQ refugees and asylees, it fell short of providing an epidemiological profile of the scope of this problem with this population. The parent study shed a preliminary light on the presence of suicidality through examination of the impacts of child abuse as study participants transitioned from adolescence to their adult lives (Alessi et al., 2016). This approach interpreted suicidality through the lens of unaccepting and unsupportive social environments (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006; Hatzenbuehler, 2011). Therefore, this dissertation adds to the literature by centering the experiences of suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylees as the focus of study, rather than as a result or factor of separate discussion (e.g. childhood trauma).  In this study, several study participants described attempting suicide at least once, where attempts ranged their lifespan from their teen years through their present life. Cumulative disadvantage theory was included in the theoretical framework of this dissertation to serve as the paradigm in which to conceptualize potential cumulative risk from a lifespan trajectory perspective. Axiom 3 stated that “life course trajectories are shaped by the accumulation of risk, available resources, and human agency” (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009). Study participants described suicide attempts that ranged as early as their teenage years, all the way through resettlement, and up until less than a year before their participation in the parent study, which aligned with this lifespan trajectory paradigm.  The parent study also conceptualized the experiences of CPTSD (Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers to be rooted in the   70 cumulative nature of severe trauma and traumatic events from childhood (Alessi et al., 2016; Alessi & Kahn, 2017). This dissertation builds upon these published findings by highlighting suicidality as a potential disparate mental health outcome that resulted from this childhood adversity. It also connects to the aforementioned cumulative disadvantage theory by connecting the described experiences of suicide attempt as outcomes of trauma and distress from across the lifespan and not just limited to childhood adversity. Internal and Interpersonal Support The importance of human relationships and connection emerged as a central protective factor in relation to suicide contemplation. Seven participants mentioned contemplating suicidality at least once. These participants identified having courage, resilience, and people in their lives who cared for them (including family members and close friends) as integral to their living through their contemplation of suicide. This aligns with the evidence from the theoretical framework. The minority stress model was used as a lens through which to view suicidality in LGBTQ individuals in the theoretical framework of this dissertation. The Family Acceptance Project (2009) found that LGBQ young individuals who experienced rejection from their families were almost 9 times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers who either experienced low or no levels of family rejection (Ryan et al., 2009). Additionally, Axiom 2 of the cumulative disadvantage theory posits that advantage increases exposure to opportunity while disadvantage increases the potential for risk (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009). For the study participants, individuals who identified close trusted relationships were in essence identifying those relationships as advantages (or protective factors) which increased their exposure to opportunity, the resilience to survive suicidal contemplation.    71 Further, it can be suggested that with these close personal relationships, the study participants were able to have their LGBTQ identities honored to some degree. The presence of this type of relationship that honored their identity as they navigated the complexities of time and space along their journeys aligns with the queer migration theory. This also aligns with the statistic for LGBTQ youth mentioned in the theoretical framework chapter where LGBTQ youth who have at least one adult who is accepting of their identity are 40% less likely to report a suicide attempt than their at-risk counterparts who reported that they did not have such an adult (The Trevor Project, 2019). Secondary Exposure to Trauma  The presence of experiences of suicidal contemplation and attempts were also observed within close relationships with six study participants. The three key social networks or relationship types that emerged from six study participants’ stories were friendships, intimate relationships, and fellow asylees. Thus, the integral nature of human relationships is explored from a different perspective. The Centers for Disease Control (Centers for Disease Control, 2019) have defined risk factors for suicidality that span the system level. Presently, one of the major risk factors related to human relationships is defined as “local epidemics of suicide” (Centers for Disease Control, 2019, n.p.). While this phrase is discussed as an interpersonal and community-level risk factor, it is less utilized in the literature. It is principally used in relation to adolescents as a target population in a school-based setting. An example of this in the literature is this historical definition of local epidemics, where “one suicide in a school often triggers a rash of other attempts” (Stupple, 1987, p. 64). This conceptualization of interpersonal suicide risk is limiting in that it does not capture what   72 was captured in the literature related to the experiences of suicidality within the study participants’ existing social networks.  The findings of this study suggest that the concept secondary exposure to trauma may more accurately capture this phenomenon observed in relation to suicidality within existing social networks and its potential impact on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The observation of suicidality within informal and intimate relationships (i.e. secondary exposure to trauma) could be viewed as exposure to a traumatic event involving prejudice, where the person within the participant’s network was experiencing anti-LGBTQ prejudice or discrimination. This secondary exposure to trauma also aligns with Axiom 3 of the cumulative disadvantage theory, where the experience of the secondary exposure could be considered part of the accumulation of risk whereby the vulnerable LGBTQ refugee or asylee’s life trajectory could be shaped differently (Ferraro & Shippee, 2009). Further inquiry must be conducted to explore the potential impacts of secondary exposure to trauma, specifically in observing suicidality within an individual’s existing social network, and how that may impact their own experiences of suicidal contemplation and attempt.  Retraumatization Eight study participants discussed their experiences of sharing their traumatic stories over and over with different officials along their resettlement trajectories. The majority of these participants experienced major concerns related to their reliving of the trauma they had endured, the distress they endured as a result of sharing their stories repeatedly, and their personal privacy. This finding builds upon findings from the parent study, where it was found that “some LGBT forced migrants may not feel comfortable   73 disclosing their sexual orientation,” even after resettling in the United States or Canada, where individuals still experience discrimination based upon gender identity and sexual orientation (Alessi, 2016). These findings reflect the theme of retraumatization.   Complex post-traumatic stress was described in the background chapter of this dissertation as being rooted in traumatic events that stem from prolonged trauma and interpersonal violence that can include more direct forms of abuse, neglect, and intimate partner violence as well as larger structural trauma like war, torture, and exploitation (Mahoney, Karatzias, & Hutton, 2019). Considering the amount of trauma, distress, and adversity that the study participants experienced throughout their lives, it is likely that this process of having to tell their story repeatedly left them vulnerable to retraumatization due to the ongoing and unresolved nature of their traumatic experiences.   Within the minority stress model, stigma has been defined as the perceptions and experiences of prejudice and discrimination in a hostile environment that contributes to the development of chronic stress and health problems, including suicidal thoughts and actions (Burton et al., 2013). When study participants described challenges related to shame, privacy, and trust in the repeat telling of their stories, they were describing the experiences of stigma. This stigma, the real or perceived process of pressure and disbelief in the repeat sharing of their stories, could then lead the study participants to later expectations of prejudice in their formal encounters, the need to conceal their stories, or to internalize these experiences (Walch et al., 2016) through retraumatization. It is notable that all of the participants who discussed issues related to privacy and trust where Black-identified from Africa and the Caribbean. Further inquiry should be conducted   74 regarding the complex intersections of race and culture in relation to the experiences of stigma experienced by LGBTQ refugees and asylees.  Queer migration politics presents an alternate paradigm for LGBTQ asylum seekers to repeatedly tell their stories in a non-stigmatizing manner. Study participants may have had a hard time sharing their stories due to the lifetime of negative encounters and distrust across these systems, coupled with the shame of their own stories and/or recognizing or acknowledging that the incidences may have been traumatic. Likewise, the paradigm of queer migration politics would allow them to share their experiences of trauma in distress in their words and from their own perspectives, rather than attempting to configure their story into a way that fits the expectations of the representatives of the dominant culture (e.g. lawyers, immigration officials, psychologists) from whom they are seeking assistance in obtaining asylum and refuge (Ormsbee, 2006). Integration of Findings  While each theme from the study exploration has been discussed individually, the findings come together to form a larger constellation of concepts that may impact LGBTQ refugees and asylees. Likewise, the complex nature of human relationships, secondary exposure to trauma, retraumatization, and stigma have all emerged as having unique impact on the study participants as they navigated their lives. Study participants who were able to recognize positive and trusting relationships were, in essence, identifying support and protection against suicidal contemplation. However, some study participants also identified individuals in their social networks who were also experiencing suicidality. In these instances, the study participants may have been impacted by this secondary exposure to trauma. Further, study participants who   75 experienced consistent adversity when formally reporting violence and harassment to police officers were potentially likely to experience retraumatization and stigma. Together, these findings form a deeper level of understanding of the experiences of LGBTQ refugees and asylees and their experiences of suicidality and recounting of their trauma and distress.   Limitations There were limitations to this dissertation study. The background and theoretical framework of this study entailed limited discussion of protective factors associated with each type of and level of risk and oppression. This was due to the nature of the examination and exploration of factors related to cumulative risk. It is the intention of the researcher to conduct future research that discusses protective factors, resilience, and cultural values that provide strength and protection for LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers across system levels. There was also limited discussion related to specific system levels that contribute to risk, including the family and religious communities. Each of these topics are also included in the researcher’s research agenda for further, in-depth exploration.  Another limitation of the background of this study is in the identification of the target population. To the knowledge of the researcher, after exhaustive review, there is not exact quantifiable data available to determine specific numbers of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers or their experiences of suicidality. Likewise, in the chapter related to the context of suicidality, the statistics related to LGBTQ individuals is for adolescents and young adults. This age range is slightly different than the age range of LGBTQ adults which may be older than young adulthood and thus have different life and development   76 experiences. However, this data is useful in providing preliminary context as well as identifying gaps of knowledge in the exploration into this area.   This study was a secondary analysis of existing data (26 verbatim transcripts). Thus, the researcher did not have access to the study participants to ask direct questions related to suicidality or follow up and explore for clarification and further details. Likewise, the original study was not designed to answer the specific research questions of this and may not go into as much depth as primary research would have potentially produced. Similarly, this researcher does not have access to follow up interviews or the codes and memos that were developed as part of the original study. The research was also unable to pick up nonverbal cues and indicators due to the nature of reading verbatim transcripts. The analysis of the study was conducted solely by the doctoral researcher, which may have impacted the overall trustworthiness of the study. The researcher experienced challenges in conducting the study analysis due to the isolation and quarantine of the COVID-19 global pandemic. These limitations were addressed through on-going reflection and processing in the researcher logs as well as continual check-ins and supervision from the dissertation chair. In the future, a team-based approach for data analysis could potentially mitigate these areas of trustworthiness in code generation and overall theme development.  In the parent study, three of the participants spoke Farsi and their interviews were conducted in the presence of an interpreter. Likewise, there may have been words, phrases, or concepts that were discussed during those interviews that may have been interpreted incompletely or incorrectly. This may have then created limitations in the ability to fully identify and explore potential expressions or descriptions of distress or   77 trauma, specifically related to Research Question 2. To address issues related to recall in the parent study, the interviewers conducted follow up phone calls with English speaking participants. These follow up phone calls were not able to be made to Farsi speaking participants.  There were also limitations related to representativeness. The sample consisted mostly of gay men and transgender women as participants, thus representing a narrow view of the LGBTQ experience. Further, the sample was heterogeneous regarding country of origin and ethnicity, thus limiting the study from exploring culture-bound similarities. The data was collected in 2014-2015, with descriptions of life experiences that had happened up until that point. Likewise, there may be current nuances to the findings if the same study were conducted presently, especially related to the complex nature of human relations, due to an increased interconnectedness through social media connections and overall increased globalization as well as nationalism.  Implications for Social Work & Recommendations  A strength of this dissertation study is that it is one of the first empirical studies to formally document and explore suicidality as a centered topic of exploration with LGBTQ refugees and asylees. As previously noted, the background chapter of this dissertation synthesized public health findings and statistics related to suicidality in American LGBTQ adolescents and African refugees. While this evidence was able to provide a preliminary context for which to understand the potential intensity of suicidality with LGBTQ refugees and asylees, it fell short of providing an epidemiological profile of the scope of this problem with this population.    78 Likewise, it is critical that further research be conducted to formally document the experiences of suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylees in particular as well as other refugee and asylum-seekers. Further, there are mostly non-peer reviewed and media-based sources documenting present LGBTQ-centered human rights oppression and progress at present. This calls for human rights and social welfare researchers to be charged with furthering the empirical research in this area. This includes documenting these experiences as well as analyzing them from the individual, community, and policy perspectives. This research should then be leveraged to advocate for systemic, structural policy changes domestically and internationally that can champion the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ people.  There was heterogeneity in study participant demographics throughout much of the findings. Likewise, it was notable that Black-identified participants discussing issues of privacy and trust in relation to the telling of their stories of trauma. Likewise, further inquiry should explore the intersections of race, culture, and religion within the context of suicidality and trauma with LGBTQ refugees and asylees.  Alessi and colleagues (2018; 2019) began to explore these intersections through the lenses religion and faith identification as well as resettlement integration. They found that LGBTQ refugees and asylees resettled in Austria and the Netherlands experienced prejudice and discrimination in these host countries during the attempts at integration from the greater public as well as within the LGBTQ community due to skin color and Muslim identification (2018). Further, they explore the role that religion had on LGBTQ refugees and asylees development of shame and self-blame in relation to their experiences of suicidality   79 (2019). Further inquiry into these areas of intersection are needed as well as the integration of these types of stories into broader anti-racist and anti-oppressive discourse. The aforementioned discussion of research findings indicates several implications for social work practitioners. These implications are related to human relationships, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. The complexities of human relationships that arose in this study suggest further study. Trusting, affirming relationships showed to foster positivity and potentially mitigate suicide risk. However, there were situations where suicidal individuals within the study participants’ existing social networks may have evoked secondary exposure to trauma. Both of these types of relationships should be studied further in relation to suicide risk and protection from risk.  Alessi and Kahn ( 2017) developed a clinical practice framework for clinical practice and mental health services with LGBTQ asylum seekers. The overall goal of this framework was to cultivate resiliency in LGBTQ asylum seekers (particularly those with CPTSD) in order to better cope and integrate while navigating the types of stressors associated with the minority stress model. The three core components of the framework are as follows: • establishing safety and stability in treatment and in the environment,  • developing skills for managing the asylum claims process,  • and providing strategies for dealing with the challenges of resettlement (Alessi & Kahn, 2017). If LGBTQ refugees or asylees have experienced stigma through negative encounters with formal agents and helpers during their journey, they may then experience   80 difficulty or resistance in developing future relationships and trusting bonds with practitioners. Likewise, establishing safety and stability in the practice and client settings is one crucial way that practitioners can mitigate against such complex and compounding issues as prior stigma, retraumatization, and secondary exposure to trauma. Further, strategic intervention for dealing and coping through the asylum claim process and broader challenges in resettlement can directly assist LGBTQ refugees or asylees in cultivating resilience, strength, and trust.  The Suicide Prevention Resource Center has defined a gatekeeper as “anyone who is strategically positioned to recognize and refer someone at risk of suicide” (QPR Gatekeeper Training for Suicide Prevention | Suicide Prevention Resource Center, n.d.).  Further, a gatekeeper is one who has “face-to-face contact with large numbers of community members as part of their usual routine” (Burnette et al., 2015; U.S. Surgeon General & National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention, 2012). LGBTQ refugees and asylees may interact with gatekeepers from their locality of origin through their forced migration journey. These individuals may include social workers, police and law enforcement members, caseworkers, teachers, religious leaders, etc. Having their LGBTQ identities and experiences honored by trusted practitioners and gatekeepers can then serve as a protection against experiences of suicidality. However, findings from this dissertation have demonstrated that gatekeepers also have the capacity to facilitate harmful and traumatic experiences with LGBTQ individuals.   There is little empirical evidence in the literature that has focused on gatekeeper suicide prevention with LGBTQ refugees and asylees specifically or broader forced migration populations in general. In 2018, Colucci and colleagues published guidelines   81 for gatekeeper suicide intervention and prevention (suicide first-aid) for immigrants and refugees. This study was conducted through the iterative Delphi study methodology with forty-four experts, practitioners, and individuals with related lived experiences. Ultimately, eighty guidelines were developed to support and intervene with immigrants and refugees experiencing suicidality (Colucci et al., 2018). It is strongly recommended that further culturally responsive gatekeeper suicide prevention research and training occur for practitioners acting in a formal capacity as gatekeepers who engage with LGBTQ refugees and asylees specifically, particularly with those who are experiencing immediate crisis, trauma, or distress. Further, it is strongly recommended that both validation and cultural adaptation of broader suicide intervention and prevention models occur for intervention with LGBTQ refugees and asylees as well as broader forced migration populations. These culturally responsive assessments and interventions should be developed through acknowledgment of both the potential for retraumatization as well as the very individualized nature of experiencing and reporting trauma for LGBTQ refugees and asylees. Social workers should take the lead in advocating for education, training, research, and policy making that holds themselves as well as other professionals accountable for interacting with LGBTQ refugees, asylees, and individuals in an affirming way that mitigates stigma, shame, and retraumatization. Ultimately, community participatory and collaborative research is essential in further research, policy advocacy, and direct social work practice. Further exploratory research, intervention validation, policy advocacy, and direct practice should be all be conducted through continual participation and collaboration with the individuals who are   82 actually experiencing this phenomenon of suicidality and trauma – LGBTQ refugees and asylees themselves. Intervention research can only be truly beneficial for this population when their voices and experiences are heard as well as when they have a contributing voice to the nature and direction of said research and intervention.  Conclusion  In conclusion, this study provided novel contributions to the greater empirical literature by centering exploration research around the experiences of suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylees as well as exploration into the ways in which they describe their trauma and distress.  This exploration started with a comprehensive exploration of the literature related to suicidality among LGBTQ individuals in the United States, refugees and asylum seekers, and then LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers that was situated in the broader context of suicide in the United States. Historical and current global experiences of oppression in LGBTQ individuals were then explored in different global regions. Human rights law related to LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers was surveyed at length to provide additional context. A theoretical framework was then developed for contextualizing factors contributing to suicidality in LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. This framework provided context by which to conceptualize the unique contributing factors to suicidality across the lifespan of LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers through a culturally relevant paradigm by which to process these findings. The complex nature internal and interpersonal supports, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization emerged as themes in the study findings as well as having unique implications for social work.    83 Future research recommendations include further inquiry into these findings and implications related to suicide, complex trauma, and distress as well as protective factors that can foster joy and positivity in the lives of LGBTQ refugees and asylees. This future research should be should be conducted collaboratively with LGBTQ refugees and asylees. It must be conducted in a way that honors, empowers, and amplifies the voices LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers themselves. Social workers must be on the forefront of research, training, and advocacy for LGBTQ refugees and asylees.                   84 References Adams, N., Hitomi, M., & Moody, C. (2017).

    "abstract": "In a global context where attitudes towards refugees and asylum seekers as well as LGBTQ human rights are becoming increasingly virulent, LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers are at an increased risk for a number of mental health problems, including suicidal ideation and attempts. While evidence has shown high prevalence of suicidality among refugees and LGBTQ people separately, no studies have specifically examined this phenomenon among those who are members of both groups – that is, LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Thus, the purpose of this dissertation is to explore factors related to the experiences distress, trauma, and suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers. Utilizing a theoretical framework combining cumulative disadvantage theory, the minority stress model, and queer migration theory, a secondary qualitative analysis was conducted of interviews with 26 LGBTQ refugees and asylum seekers in the U.S. and Canada. Thematic analysis was applied to understand the experiences of trauma, distress, and suicidality among LGBTQ refugees and asylees. The results of this study indicated three themes related trauma, distress, and suicidality: internal and interpersonal supports, secondary exposure to trauma, and retraumatization. The findings are discussed in light of the theoretical framework and the concepts of secondary exposure to trauma and retraumatization. Finally, the study’s limitations as implications for social work and recommendations for future research are presented",
