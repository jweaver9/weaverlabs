Here, we summarize the outputs from a vir-tual unconventional conference (unconference), which brought together 54 invited expertsfrom 20 countries with extensive experience in ECR initiatives designed to improve the cul-ture and practice of science. Together, we drafted 2 sets of recommendations for (1) ECRsdirectly involved in initiatives or activities to change research culture and practice; and (2)stakeholders who wish to support ECRs in these efforts. Importantly, these points apply toECRs working to promote change on a systemic level, not only those improving aspects oftheir own work. In both sets of recommendations, we underline the importance of incentiviz-ing and providing time and resources for systems-level science improvement activities,including ECRs in organizational decision-making processes, and working to dismantlestructural barriers to participation for marginalized groups. We further highlight obstaclesthat ECRs face when working to promote reform, as well as proposed solutions and exam-ples of current best practices. The abstract and recommendations for stakeholders areavailable in Dutch, German, Greek (abstract only), Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese,Spanish, and Serbian.IntroductionIn recent years, the scientific community has been facing a reckoning over the culture andpractice of research. What began with concerns about reproducibility [1,2] and waste in bio-medical research [3] has expanded to a wide variety of concerns about the academic ecosystem.Critics cite misaligned incentives [4,5], poor working conditions [5,6], and systemic discrimi-nation and bias [7,8] as undermining the discovery and dissemination of new findings. Workto improve research culture and practice is diverse in scope and nature and includes projectsfocused on themes such as reproducibility, publishing, public involvement, and diversity. Thiswork can take many forms, including initiatives, events, committee activities, and meta-research. Meta-research applies the scientific method to study science itself. This is a powerfulapproach for identifying problems and developing targeted solutions to improve researchPLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 2 / 19conduct [9]. While many stakeholders have highlighted the need for scientific reform, the lackof consensus about what needs to change, how to implement systemic changes, and whoshould fund and conduct this work creates challenges for those working to improve science.As the largest and most diverse cohort of scientists [10], ECRs play an important role in sci-ence improvement. While definitions differ by country, ECRs include graduate and medicalstudents, young clinical researchers, postdoctoral fellows, and recently appointed independentinvestigators early in their independent careers. Problems with the scientific system directlyaffect ECRs, who may have a vested interest in improving the system that they are inheriting.Box 1 highlights additional reasons why ECR involvement and leadership is important toimproving research culture and practice.ECRs have led many successful initiatives to improve research culture and practice. Forexample, more than 2,000 researchers across 6 continents have received training in reproduc-ible research practices through 25 workshops offered by the ECR-led organization Reproduc-ibility for Everyone [11]. Young Science in Transition is changing incentives by successfullyencouraging Dutch universities to adopt PhD evaluation policies that emphasize personalgrowth and reproducible research practices over bibliometric measures [12]. Black BirdersWeek, an ECR-initiated social media campaign to raise awareness of Black scientists’ workBox 1. Why do we need ECRs to improve science?There are many reasons why ECRs are critical players in science improvement.• Future leaders: ECRs are future leaders in the research community. They should beinvolved in shaping the future of the scientific system.• Diverse cohort: ECRs are a far more diverse cohort than senior scientists [10,16].Diversity of age, sex, gender identity, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability, culture,socioeconomic status, language, national origin, and geography bring new perspec-tives and more creative and generalizable solutions for improving science [17–20].Diversity decreases with advancing career stage due to prejudicial factors like ableism,classism, racism, and sexism [8].• Open to new solutions: ECRs may be more open to new solutions than senior scien-tists, who have adopted conventional approaches and succeeded in the existing system[21,22].• Optimism: ECRs may have a yet unchallenged idealism about the scientific enterprise,motivating their reform efforts.• “Hands-on” role: ECRs gain technical skills from collecting and analyzing data withthe newest tools that place them at the forefront of advances. ECRs often rely on peer-to-peer networks to learn new skills; therefore, ECRs are critical for implementing bestpractices in reproducible and open methodology.• Time: While ECR experiences differ, some can invest more time and energy thansenior colleagues in science improvement.• Majority of the workforce: ECRs form the majority of the scientific workforce andtherefore need to be involved in efforts to implement widespread change, ideally incollaboration with established investigators and other stakeholders.PLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 3 / 19and the challenges they face, led to the creation of courses and fundraising initiatives foryoung researchers of color and inspired similar campaigns for other fields [13–15]. S1 Tableprovides additional examples of successful ECR-led initiatives.This paper summarizes recommendations from an international virtual unconferenceexamining the role of ECRs in catalyzing systemic change in science [8]. Unconferences areparticipant-driven unconventional conferences designed to maximize informal, stimulatingdiscussions, and networking. The 54 participating experts were invited because of their leadingroles in ECR science improvement efforts. Attendees came from 20 countries, were mostlyECRs, and were predominantly working in biomedicine and biology. Details of the unconfer-ence format and event were previously reported [8].Here, we provide 2 sets of recommendations. First, we offer recommendations for earlycareer researchers (ECRs) who are working to improve research culture and practice at a sys-temic level by launching initiatives, creating peer networks, or advocating for change withinorganizations. Second, we outline recommendations for stakeholders who wish to supportECRs involved in initiatives to improve research culture and practice. For each of the 6 recom-mendations, we outline central challenges, suggest potential solutions, and highlight selectexamples of good practices in the international research community.Instead of discussing all challenges that ECRs face, or the problems that ECRs encounterwhen implementing more reproducible practices in their own research, we focus on challengesencountered by the subset of ECRs who are working toward systemic changes. For example,some ECRs are working specifically to promote open science, and the recommendations inthis manuscript are designed to help stakeholders support those ECRs working to facilitatechange beyond their own research. This might include organizing training to help other scien-tists implement open science skills, working with publishers to enact policies that encourageauthors to use open science practices within their papers, implementing policies that rewardopen science, changing practices in hiring commissions, faculty evaluations or dissertations,or advising funding agencies on integrating open science practices into funding applicationsand decisions. While some of these recommendations may also benefit ECRs who are simplyimplementing new practices in their own research, this is not our focus. Fig 1 illustrates someof the themes of these initiatives. Unfortunately, we cannot explore all reasons or approachesto improve research culture and practice in this short paper. Instead, we refer readers to excel-lent reviews cited in the introduction and throughout the recommendations (e.g., [1,3–5,8]).Recommendations for ECRs involved in research improvementactivitiesThis section highlights several recommendations that contribute to the successes of ECR initia-tives. Fig 2 provides a schematic of the stages of project evolution as a function of effort andpotential impact. In addition, S2 Table provides some ideas for ECRs who are interested inimproving research but are unsure where to start. Our online repository (https://osf.io/ad57e)provides additional advice on developing science improvement initiatives, including detailedguidance on topics like understanding organizational structure, developing a communicationstrategy, and making initiatives sustainable.Know what has been done beforeECRs should do their research before starting a new initiative, as they would when planning anew research study. This saves time and builds one’s network by identifying collaborators andallies. Organize structured conversations to identify solutions and attract allies [6]. ECRs mayalso find materials that they can use or initiatives that they can join or amplify. UnderstandingPLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 4 / 19why previous efforts did not work is critical—this allows ECRs to anticipate obstacles anddevelop plans to succeed where others have failed. Developing a new initiative takes time andresource, so look for opportunities to join existing activities that are already having an impact.Joining an existing committee or group may lead to faster results.Start with a feasible goalWhile ECRs may have an expansive vision and numerous innovative ideas, pursuing manyideas concurrently often leads to frustration, feeling overwhelmed and failure. Starting withstepwise, feasible goals allows the team to refine their approach and materials while buildingexperience and momentum. Once the approach is working, the team can build on their successby expanding to new communities or adding new goals. See S2 Table for some ideas on howto get started.Collaborate wiselyInitiatives often require skills and expertise in many different areas (e.g., education, policychange, and software development). Look for strong collaborators who have the necessaryskills and expertise. The team should also be diverse and representative of the community thatthe initiative plans to work within. Ensure that team members have time for planned tasks.Add new members as you identify gaps.Work toward equity, diversity, and inclusionReplacing biased, prejudicial, and exclusive systems and behaviors with inclusive alternativesis essential [8]. Initiatives should seek out individuals from minoritized and marginalizedgroups, remove barriers to participation and ability to thrive, and learn about the impacts ofFig 1. Themes of scientific reform efforts. Common themes of science reform work include publishing,reproducibility, public involvement and science communication, diversity and global perspectives, ECR training andworking conditions, and rewards and incentives. This figure provides a general overview of some themes included ineach topic and overlapping areas. It is impossible to display all themes and overlapping areas.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680.g001PLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 5 / 19implicit and explicit biases. We encourage all scientists to adopt inclusive and equitableapproaches and disseminate these approaches within their initiatives and research environ-ments. Lifelong learning is essential, as equity and inclusion needs and best practices evolveover time. Initiatives should create and disseminate materials in an inclusive and accessiblemanner. Strategies include using inclusive language, providing closed captioning for record-ings, or offering materials in different languages.Build a positive and inclusive team dynamicA code of conduct may help to define expectations for behavior and communication. Ensurethat there is a strong moderator to encourage balanced discussion, center, and amplify margin-alized voices, and transparently communicate the reasons behind team decisions. Get to knowpeople so that the team dynamic is social and enjoyable. When delegating tasks, agree on rolesbased on strengths and interests.Anticipate concerns or resistanceLearn about the process for making changes at the organization and anticipate objections.Build support by preparing responses to common concerns. Engage with target audiences tounderstand problems, interests, and solutions. Design achievable and compelling solutionsand use feedback to refine these solutions.Fig 2. Balancing effort and impact in science reform initiatives. ECRs who are developing an initiative shouldconsider the amount of effort that each stage will require and the potential impact. Actions that allow others to reusematerials to start their own initiatives can amplify impact by expanding the initiative’s reach. This conceptual figureillustrates the relationship between effort and impact for the ReproducibiliTea journal club initiative [23]. The effortand impact values are subjective. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine which specific actions had the greatestimpact. Organizers may implement several new approaches simultaneously. Impacts are often delayed, as awareness ofinitiatives builds over time. Finally, it is important to note that this diagram was based on a successful initiative. Not allinitiatives are successful and effort does not always increase impact. Organizers should prioritize actions that theythink are most likely to increase impact, then adapt their strategy based on the results. ECR, early career researcher.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680.g002PLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 6 / 19Be persistentSystemic change takes time. Talk with people at different career stages and within distinctparts of the organization. Do not be discouraged if some of the people approached are notinterested. Adapt the team’s strategy to get around roadblocks. There are often many paths toreach a goal; the team only needs to find one path that works.Share your workIdentify your target audience before creating materials and develop an effective communica-tion strategy for this audience. You may need a different communication strategy to pitch yourinitiative to decision makers or potential allies. Choose dissemination platforms that youraudience uses (e.g., the Open Science Framework for documents, GitHub for code, and socialmedia for raising awareness). Consider potential barriers to sharing your message, such as lan-guage, access to materials, and dissemination outside the team’s networks. Expand your reachby adapting materials for other groups. Collaborate to amplify the efforts of complementarygroups with similar goals.Plan for sustainabilityECRs are often in transient positions; therefore one must plan for how the initiative will con-tinue after the organizers leave. Systemic change takes time and persistence. The team mayneed to approach the problem from several angles or collaborate with other groups thatapproach the problem differently. Sunset the initiative if it is no longer needed.Recommendations for stakeholdersTable 1 summarizes 6 recommendations that stakeholders can implement to support ECRefforts to improve the culture and practice of science. This table and the abstract for the paperare also available in Dutch (S3 Table and S1 Text), German (S4 Table and S2 Text), Greek(abstract only, S3 Text), Italian (S5 Table and S4 Text), Japanese (S6 Table and S5 Text), Polish(S7 Table and S6 Text), Portuguese (S8 Table and S7 Text), Serbian (S9 Table and S8 Text),and Spanish (S10 Table and S9 Text). Each recommendation is accompanied by a series of spe-cific actions. Stakeholders include institutions and departments, funding agencies, scientificsocieties, journals and publishers, ECR peer communities and allies. Allies, supervisors, andmentors play a special role in empowering ECRs. While these individuals can directly act onrecommendations, they can also advocate for ECRs and their science improvement workthrough other positions that they hold in an organization (e.g., committee work or grantreview).Many, but not all, of these recommendations may require financial investments from stake-holders. Typically, organizations do not provide funding for science improvement activities.Passionate researchers often pursue these activities on a voluntary basis. Funding researchimprovement activities, however, can pay notable dividends by increasing the quality andtransparency of scientific work, and creating a healthier and more productive work culture. Ageneral overview of potential costs may be found in column 3 of Table 1, where we have differ-entiated between actions that likely involve costs ($), actions that may or may not involve costsdepending on the setting and implementation ($/−), and actions that typically have low or nocosts (−). These ratings are highly subjective, as costs often depend on context and implemen-tation.

Unfortunately, costs forscience improvement activities are often externalized. People donate time because they arepassionate about the topic. Once organizations know that people are willing to do the work forfree, they see no reason to fund these activities. In our experience, time that passionate ECRsdonate when working to improve research culture and practice is a significant externalizedcost. Not funding this work undermines and disincentives science improvement efforts.Provide a path for career progression by rewarding and incentivizingscience improvement activitiesScience improvement work is rarely rewarded or incentivized and does not traditionally con-tribute to career progression. The factors that are rewarded and incentivized determine whosecures faculty positions and leadership roles. While universities around the world havedepartments for fields like biology or epidemiology, only a few centers focus on meta-researchor research improvement. Faculty positions in these areas are extremely rare. Meta-researchand research improvement activities are not widely valued when hiring faculty, as conven-tional career advancement criteria prioritize grants and publications in journals with highimpact factors. Until meta-research and science improvement activities are rewarded andincentivized, ECRs who excel in these areas will continue to be pushed out of science beforesecuring faculty positions or leadership roles where it is easier to implement systemic changes.Table 1.

Consult current best practices resources, as diversity, equity, and inclusion practices are context dependent and evolve over time.ECR, early career researcher.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680.t001PLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 9 / 19We have suggested 5 specific actions that stakeholders can take to foster a research culturethat values science improvement activities alongside more “traditional” outputs (Table 1).Some of these specific actions focus on reevaluating existing reward, incentive, and evaluationstructures. This includes encouraging individuals or groups that evaluate ECRs, such as hiringand promotion committees and training grants reviewers, to reward systemic efforts toimprove science. Institutions and funders will likely need to introduce policy changes thatexplicitly outline these new criteria and provide training to facilitate implementation. Thesepolicy changes should also address equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI; see also “Championefforts to support marginalized ECRs” below).Other specific actions that organizations can take to implement this recommendationinvolve creating new opportunities to support meta-scientists and others working to improvescience, as these activities are essential to the scientific community. For example, creating fac-ulty positions or centers for meta-researchers and other scientists who work on researchimprovement is essential. Science improvement centers allow researchers to test initiatives atthe institution before expanding outward [24]. One such example is Young Science in Transi-tion, an ECR group at the Utrecht University Medical Center, which redesigned PhD evalua-tion criteria to incorporate personal growth and responsible research practices in addition topublications. These criteria are being adopted by other Dutch graduate schools [12].PLOS Biology has also worked with meta-scientists to launch a meta-research collection[25], which facilitates dissemination by publishing science of science papers in a journal that isoften read by traditional scientists. Submitted manuscripts are examined by qualified meta-scientists.Finally, the Einstein Foundation offers an award for ECRs who are working to improveresearch [26]. While only one award is given per year, this competition may raise awarenessand amplify successful ECR science improvement activities.Integrate ECRs into decision-making processesOrganizational hierarchies often exclude ECRs from decision-making roles [27]. Withoutdecision-making power, ECRs struggle to implement change and improve the scientific sys-tem. As ECRs make up the majority of the scientific workforce, they should be involved indecision-making at all levels.Organizations should integrate ECRs at different career stages into their decision-makingprocesses [27] (Table 1). Options include creating an early career advisory group, adding ECRrepresentatives to committees or combining both approaches. ECR advisory groups offer avariety of ECR perspectives; however, ECRs are not at the decision-making table. Advisorygroups require a consistent, open, and strong dialog with leadership to be effective in settingpriorities, refining ideas, and launching initiatives. Alternatively, organizations can alsoinclude ECR representatives on committees (e.g., [28]). A disadvantage of this approach is thatone ECR voice can easily be suppressed or overlooked. Committees should ensure that theenvironment is welcoming and inclusive to ECR members. Having at least 2 ECR membersper committee offers different perspectives, while providing peer support. Committee workand any costs (e.g., for traveling to meetings) should be distributed and funded equitably toavoid unduly burdening ECRs.Combining an early career advisory group with ECR committee representatives may be themost effective approach. Advisory group ECRs can serve on committees related to their exper-tise, while soliciting input from other advisory group members to obtain a broader perspective.Committees selecting ECR members should avoid using career milestones as a proxy forexpertise (e.g., applicants must have a PhD). Researchers at the same career stage can havePLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 10 / 19vastly different skills. Organizations should outline necessary skills and ask candidates toexplain their experience.International organizations that add ECRs to committees should include representativesfrom communities or countries with limited research funding (see also “Champion efforts tosupport marginalized ECRs” “and “Support global initiatives to improve research culture andpractice” below). Diversity at all levels avoids structural inequalities in power structures andcreates a more welcoming environment for ECRs from marginalized communities or coun-tries with limited research funding, increasing the likelihood that their perspectives will beconsidered. ECR committee members should be recruited through internationally advertisedopen calls, rather than through recommendations from organization members. This may par-tially level the playing field for those without connections, while extending the organization’sreach.One example is the eLife Early Career Advisory Group, which includes ECRs from aroundthe world. This group advises eLife on improving scientific publishing and ECR issues andassists with running the eLife Ambassador Program and ECRWednesday webinars. Otherorganizations have similar advisory roles for ECRs (e.g., Dryad Scientific Advisory Committee,ASAPbio Board of Directors) [29,30].Provide ECRs who are skilled in research improvement with resources,funding, and protected time to improve research culture and practiceIn our experience, there is a lack of resources and protected time for activities to improveresearch culture and practice. With notable exceptions (e.g., the Volkswagen Foundation’s Pio-neer Projects), most major funders do not offer grants for science improvement work. Whenfederal agencies do offer such grants, the eligibility criteria often exclude postdoctoral fellowsand graduate students. ECRs also often lack protected time for research improvement activi-ties, in part because they lack independence and job security. ECRs whose supervisors or men-tors do not support their research improvement efforts may confine these activities toevenings and weekends, limiting opportunities to collaborate with stakeholders who are onlyavailable during office hours. This problem especially affects those with care responsibilities.We recommend that stakeholders ensure that opportunities to obtain resources, funding,and protected time for research improvement activities are accessible to ECRs. This includesadapting existing programs to ensure that ECRs can access resources not only as junior part-ners, but also as leaders. In addition, we recommend that stakeholders create new programsand opportunities to support ECRs in science improvement efforts, such as seed grants forECR-led initiatives and protected time grants. Finally, stakeholders that train ECRs canencourage ECRs to explore science improvement by incorporating activities to improveresearch culture and practice into career development plans. By requiring training on topicssuch as reproducible research practices, organizations support ECRs in developing skills toimprove research. Encouraging ECRs to explore the strengths and limitations of existing sys-tems will provide opportunities to develop innovative solutions.One example of these recommendations in practice is the eLife Innovation Sprint [31],where ECRs and other scientists working on science improvement projects join designers,software developers, and other innovators for a 2-day hackathon to develop new tools toenhance publishing. The host organization benefits from new ideas and opportunities whilebuilding relationships with community members. Additionally, the University of UtrechtOpen Science Community supports ECRs working to improve science by providing commu-nity organizers and faculty ambassadors with protected time to organize open science activities[32].PLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 11 / 19Recognize ECRs’ expertise and amplify their efforts to improve scienceThe perception that ECRs lack the experience and expertise to improve science is sometimesused to justify excluding ECRs from decision-making roles [27]. This inaccurate perceptionmay also cause others to overlook valuable materials and solutions generated by ECRs. Whileexperience and expertise vary among highly diverse ECR cohorts, the many innovative andsuccessful ECR initiatives demonstrate the depth of understanding within the ECR community[33]. Due to their junior status, however, opportunities for ECRs doing this work to gain visi-bility and implement proposed solutions are limited.All stakeholders can be an ally by supporting and championing ECR-led efforts to improveresearch culture and practice. Specific actions for this recommendation focus on fostering anopen dialog and collaboration between researchers and stakeholders at all career stages work-ing to improve science. On a “macro” level, organizations can address the perception thatECRs lack the experience and expertise to improve science by publicizing and amplifying suc-cessful ECR-led initiatives. This may include organizing symposia or seminar series on ECRinitiatives, inviting ECRs to write journal commentaries on their initiatives, or sharing infor-mation on initiatives in organizational blogs and newsletters. Organizations can also providetraining and networking opportunities, or offer fellowships and hands-on courses in policychange, meta-research [34] or other topics.Open dialog and collaboration are also critical at a “micro” level within research groups.This allows, for example, integration of science improvement activities into existing researchactivities, field-testing of solutions on a smaller scale, and implementing procedures to makesuccessful changes sustainable.For example, the Young Scientists Network of the Academy of Sciences Malaysia designand run responsible conduct of research workshops [35]. Recently, they partnered with theMalaysian Ministry of Higher Education to release an educational module. They are alsoexpanding an instructor training program for the Association of Southeast Asian NationsYoung Scientists Network and the regional office of the International Science Council.Champion efforts to support marginalized ECRsStructures, institutions, and a scientific culture that is centered on Europe and North Americapose added challenges for ECRs who are members of minoritized and marginalized groups.Examples of the impacts of racism in science include stark disparities in grant funding forBlack and Minority Ethnic investigators [7,36]. Persistent sexism contributes to the underrep-resentation of people identifying as women in science, technology, engineering, and math(STEM) careers [37,38]. Given the diversity of ECRs, empowering ECRs also means tacklingsystemic and structural prejudice that make it harder for members of marginalized groups toadvocate for themselves and lead reform efforts. The scientific community must recognize thatmembers of these groups face greater obstacles when working to improve science. For exam-ple, scientists that hold minoritized and marginalized identities are rarely equitably rewardedfor their disproportionate roles in advancing diversity and inclusion [39]. Experiencing preju-dicial behavior and structures, without sufficient support, can harm mental health and careerprogression [40,41]. Eradicating racism and other biases is essential to maintain diversityacross all career stages, while ensuring that scientific progress benefits minoritized communi-ties [8].Organizations, supervisors, mentors, and allies must support efforts to improve EDI intheir communities. The interests and memberships of ECR cohorts and marginalized groupsfrequently intersect; therefore, each action listed in Table 1 must include measures toempower minoritized and marginalized groups within the ECR community. This involvesPLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 12 / 19enacting policies to ensure diverse representation in leadership positions, dismantling struc-tural barriers, and establishing a culture of equity and inclusion to combat and prevent biasand discrimination [42]. Individuals and stakeholders should implement recommendationsfrom resources that outline techniques for creating an inclusive, diverse, and welcoming envi-ronment. Resources created by members of marginalized communities can be especially valu-able and should be prioritized.There are many strong examples of projects and initiatives that support ECRs from margin-alized communities. The Animal Behaviour Collective reduces socioeconomic barriers to sci-ence participation by organizing mentorship opportunities for researchers from traditionallymarginalized communities and offering microgrants for animal behavior researchers in finan-cial need [43]. Academics for Black Survival and Wellness is a personal and professional devel-opment initiative founded to tackle anti-Black racism in academia and beyond. They providehealing resources for Black folx� and anti-racism training and accountability information fornon-Black folx. “Folx” is an altered spelling of “folks” adopted by some groups to include mar-ginalized populations. There are also resources on race and disability [44]. Finally, LGBTQ+ Advocacy in STEM is an online community for LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgen-der, queer/questioning and others) researchers in STEM professions. The group providestraining and resources for LGBTQ+ researchers and allies, with a focus on building safe andinclusive working environments [45].Support global initiatives to improve research culture and practiceECRs working to improve research culture and practice in countries with limited researchfunding often face added challenges in conducting and publishing their own research, com-pared to ECRs in countries with higher research funding [46,47]. While economic, geographic,and political differences between countries make it difficult to generalize experiences, theadded challenges for ECRs in countries with limited research funding are often amplifiedwhen ECRs work to improve science. Conducting research with limited resources (e.g., no lab-oratory/technical assistants, inflated costs for reagents, and shipping) and infrastructure chal-lenges (e.g., unreliable electricity and/or internet) creates extra work and limits ECRs “freetime” for improving research culture and practice.ECRs working to reform science in countries with limited research funding also experiencelimited networking opportunities, because of barriers to travel (e.g., lack of travel funding, visarequirements) or poor internet access. In some countries, postdocs and occasionally PIs lackinstitutional affiliations, which limits local opportunities to initiate systemic change. Languagebarriers limit access to networking and training opportunities that benefit ECRs working toreforming science. Efforts to improve EDI in academia should increase representation ofECRs from countries with limited research funding, in addition to increasing representationof marginalized groups in countries where research is well funded. However, sometimes theseefforts only create the appearance of equity and inclusion (“tokenism”).Stakeholders can support global initiatives to improve research culture and practice byinviting ECRs from communities or countries with limited research funding to share theiractivities internationally or collaborating to expand successful initiatives from underrepre-sented countries to other regions. Virtual or hybrid events bypass the disproportionate obsta-cles to travel for ECRs in countries with limited research funding [48]. When planning virtualevents, facilitating participation from scientists in different time zones is essential. Organizerscan create a video archive and plan added networking and moderated discussion times for par-ticipants who could not attend the original sessions. One example of a successful initiative thattackles linguistic barriers is PanLingua, a free online tool that uses Google Translate to enablePLOS BIOLOGYPLOS Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001680 July 7, 2022 13 / 19researchers to search for bioRxiv preprints in their own language [49]. A further example thatsupports community engagement in research is the ECR-led initiative Freshwater Turtiles andTortises of India on the India Biodiversity Portal. This system aggregates data from citizen sci-entists while providing open access biodiversity information [50,51].ConclusionsECRs are important stakeholders that are effectively working to catalyze systemic change inresearch practice and culture. Future efforts should focus on incentivizing and rewarding sys-temic efforts to improve science culture and practice. This includes providing protected timeand faculty positions for individuals working in these areas, amplifying ECR voices and mean-ingfully incorporating ECRs into decision-making structures. ECRs working on improvingscience in communities or countries with limited research funding should be supported byorganizations with access to greater resources to improve science for all. We hope that theresources shared here will enhance efforts spearheaded by ECRs around the world, whileprompting organizations and individuals to take action to support ECRs working to improvescience.Supporting informationS1 Text.

    "abstract": "Early career researchers (ECRs) are important stakeholders leading efforts to catalyze systemic change in research culture and practice. Here, we summarize the outputs from a virtual unconventional conference (unconference), which brought together 54 invited experts from 20 countries with extensive experience in ECR initiatives designed to improve the culture and practice of science. Together, we drafted 2 sets of recommendations for (1) ECRs directly involved in initiatives or activities to change research culture and practice; and (2) stakeholders who wish to support ECRs in these efforts. Importantly, these points apply to ECRs working to promote change on a systemic level, not only those improving aspects of their own work. In both sets of recommendations, we underline the importance of incentivizing and providing time and resources for systems-level science improvement activities, including ECRs in organizational decision-making processes, and working to dismantle structural barriers to participation for marginalized groups. We further highlight obstacles that ECRs face when working to promote reform, as well as proposed solutions and examples of current best practices. The abstract and recommendations for stakeholders are available in Dutch, German, Greek (abstract only), Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Serbian",
