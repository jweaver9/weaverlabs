The clashing sounds of the music fused with the enthusiastic claps and spirited shouts of dancing people at the celebration of Holi, the festival of colors.Holi is a spring celebration rooted in ancient Hindu religious tradition. It is an honored festival observing the end of winter and a salute to love and the triumph of good in the world among many other things. It is founded on feelings of merriment and joy, according to Hindu YUVA.Hindu YUVA (Youth for Unity, Virtues and Action) organized and hosted San Jose State University’s on-campus Holi celebration this year. The non-profi t organization works toward supporting public spaces for the practice and understanding of the Hindu way of life across universities in the United States.Festival of colors provided a platform for inclusivity, diversity and equality.“It doesn’t matter who you are or what color you are,” said Shobhit Gupta, a local Volume 148.

This up close and personal event showcased members of the Chavez family and included a documentary fi lm detailing his life and legacy.Chavez devoted his life to improving the working conditions for farmworkers through his work as an activist and labor leader. He co-founded the United Farm Workers (UFW) union along with Dolores Huerta in 1962 and advocated for the improvement of working conditions and pay for farm workers.“We close the library to observe Cesar Chavez holiday on March 31 so we thought we should do something to help educate the community,” said Elizabeth Castaneda, event organizer and Marketing and Communications Manager at MLK. “We are good friends with Damian Trujillo from NBC Bay Area who connected us with Rudy. We set up a meeting, Stand United brought artists of minority races together at Local Color in downtown San Jose. “The whole point of this event is for people to feel safe,” said musical performer Mardi Morillo. “It’s up to artists to express what the culture is feeling.” Event organizer Angel Michelle partnered with SIREN, Empire 7 Studios, Hip Hop for Change and Brown Berets Sunday evening to produce a showcase of performers. Art styles expressed included spoken word poetry, live music and comedy. Morillo performed his original song “A Long Way To Go,” inspired by the Charleston shooting at the historically black church in June 2015 where nine people were murdered.Morillo said he tries to express real emotion as authentically as he can.The Stand United committee was awarded a certifi cate of recognition from the California State Legislature Assembly for successfully bringing the community together.Ash Kalra, California State Assembly member of the 27th district, presented the award at 7 p.m. “If I see someone or an organization doing good work in the community,” Kalra said. “I’ll have my staff put it [an award] together and present it.”Karla said he likes to recognize groups San Jose State women’s gymnastics won the Mountain Pacifi c Sports Federation Championship on Saturday for the fi rst time since 2004. Coincidently, the team fi nished with 195.925 points, the same score it won with in 2004. It also hosted this championship just as it did during its last championship victory.“It says a lot for competing at home and hosting the championship,” said head coach Wayne Wright. The MPSF championship was held in the SJSU Event Center Saturday evening. The six schools that participated were Air Force, Alaska Anchorage, Sacramento State, San Jose State, Seattle Pacifi c and UC Davis.The Spartans placed third in last year’s championship and second in 2015. “We worked so hard each and every day for this moment,” said senior Haleigh Shepard.After all the events concluded, the awards ceremony began. Shepard won fi rst place in vault with a career-best score of 9.825 out of 10. She also became one of three gymnasts in SJSU history to win a title in vaulting.See TROPHY page 8BY TIANA WALKERSTAFF WRITERBY MARGARET GUTIERREZSTAFF WRITERSee LEGACY page 2See COMMUNITY page 2BY PAYJE REDMONDSTAFF WRITERIRISH PUB CELEBRATES SAINT PATRICK’S DAYSEE FULL STORY PAGE 3SEE THIS AND MOREVIDEOS ON YOUTUBE MARGARET GUTIERREZ | SPARTAN DAILYRudy Chavez Medina explains the struggles Cesar Chavez had when he fought for the rights of farm workers and laborers.we told him our vision, our ideas, what we wanted to do and it went from there.” Special guest speakers at this event included Rudy Medina Chavez, Rita Medina Chavez, Barbara Medina Aranda and Xavier Campos, all close friends and family members of Cesar Chavez. The speakers shared many of their personal experiences with Cesar Chavez and spoke about the impact he had on not only their lives, but those of the farm workers and laborers that he fought for.This event was interactive and the public was encouraged to ask the guest speakers questions. The Chavez family brought a wide variety of artifacts and pictures which were put on display for the public. One of the pieces on display was an original UFW fl ag which was in near perfect condition and provided a backdrop to the personal stories shared by the guest speakers.“It was important for me to be here and support the family and live what I believe is the legacy of Cesar (Chavez), his family, extended family and the people that he inspired,” San Jose native Cecely Barneson said. “He saw in other people that their life was valuable and important and he treated people with dignity and respect.”In addition to the personal stories and effects of Chavez, those in attendance were also treated to free food and beverages which were provided courtesy of Chacho’s Restaurant in downtown San Jose. Several of the attendees brought their children to educate them on the rich history of Chavez and his relationship to San Jose.“This is the fi rst event here,” said Rudy Chavez Medina. “Next year you will bring someone, we will invite some more people and this room will be packed and eventually we will not be able to let anyone in because there won’t be any standing room.” Castaneda concluded the event with a special thanks to all of the guest speakers and to those in attendance. He indicated that this event will be held annually to help educate the public on the legacy of Cesar Chavez and link between him and San Jose.Tuesday, March 21, 2017Drinks become donations at fl ood benefi tA San Jose flood benefit held at SP2 Communal Bar + Restaurant in San Pedro Square turned drinks into donations on Saturday.Hosted by InnEvents, the benefi t intended to help raise funds and awareness for San Jose residents still affected by last month’s fl ooding. The trailing damages left behind after heavy rain forced many San Jose residents to evacuate their homes are yet to be resolved for many victims.The benefi t was originally intended to be a birthday celebration for local event organizer Steven Renteria. However, after hearing about the devastating impact of fl oods on many San Jose residents, Renteria decided to transform his birthday event into a benefi t.“I was born and raised in San Jose,” Renteria said. “I saw a need to take action. It was supposed to be my birthday event, so I winged off that to turn this into a charity event.”Renteria’s San Jose roots led him to transform what would have been a birthday bash into a charity outing.The all-day event took advantage of a happy hour starting at 2 p.m. and ending at 7 p.m., during which 100 percent of door donations and a portion of bar drink sales were donated to fl ood relief efforts. Renteria said contributions will to be handed over to the non-profi t Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF).“Those are our neighbors,” said Paolo “Cutso” Bello, a participating DJ at the benefi t. “This city made us who we are. Why wouldn’t we want to give back? This could’ve happened to any of us.”Bello’s own parents live just a half mile away from the location of the most severe flooding along Coyote Creek. Bello lives a few blocks from streets that almost flooded. The crisis hit home when he realized the extent of damages caused by the overflowing waterways for local residents.Renteria and Bello were just two of many friends supporting the local fl ood cause, but their commitment to aiding local communities suffering after fl ooding fueled their involvement in making the benefi t happen.SVCF will redistribute funds to local organizations aiding victims in efforts to help relieve some of the negative repercussions of fl ooding. Services are particularly geared to help victims in neighborhoods in proximity to waterways such as Coyote Creek and Anderson Reservoir, where fl ooding was severe and slower to recede.Some of the organizations that receive fl ood relief funding from SVCF include American Red Cross, Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, The Salvation Army and Sacred Heart Community Services.Sacred Heart Community Services is listed in San Jose’s offi cial Offi ce of Emergency Services as a local resource of emergency relief funds for those severely burdened by the remaining impacts of local fl ooding.For those who dd not attend SP2’s fl ood benefi t, Silicon Valley Community Foundation’s online services provide the option to donate online or via mail by check.

The proceeds were split between the organizations and live performers. “We wanted something controversial that would raise a storm,” Michelle said. Event organizers said it took five weeks to plan Stand United.The content expressed in the live performances was not censored. Artists freely cursed in their lyrics and talked about illegal drugs where they felt appropriate.However, the majority of the performers told stories in their lyrics directly related to their experience as a black or brown youth. “If it’s a lie I don’t listen to it,” said Lysten, a male rapper from Ability.Among the performers was Sunnyvale-based group Ability, who performed its songs “Wack Rappers” and “Cali Legal.”Social activist groups were also present at the event. The Brown Berets, a pro-Chicano community activist organization, was present wearing black pants and brown shirts topped with a beret. The beret has the words “la causa”, meaning “the cause,” printed in the front. Ortiz said the uniforms are worn so they can be identified as a protectors serving the community.“People with similar like-minded ideas for policy should be united,” said Brown Berets Autonomous member Peter Ortiz.Some of the values that San Jose residents and Californians share are inconsistent with the White House, according to Kalra. “We have to be in the position where we will work in harmony with anyone,” Kalra said. “But if someone comes after one of us, whether that’s someone who is undocumented or a Muslim brother or sister, we have to say no.”San Jose resident Tayci Bodily said people can get to know their city better by coming out to events like Stand United.“It’s really important to have your voice and know how to use it in the most respectful ways,” Michelle said.CULTUREContinued from page 1Follow Payje on Twitter@TheyaskedLEGACYContinued from page 1The women, gender and sexuality studies program hosted a lecture by Huma Ahmed-Ghosh, a professor of women’s studies at San Diego State University.The lecture was part of The Carol Mukhopadhyay Feminist Lecture Series in celebration of Women’s History Month.Ahmed Ghosh’s research focuses on the lives of Muslim women in Asia, specifi cally Afghanistan and India, as well as immigrant Muslim women in the United States. She brought to question issues of identity and the effects of political constructs on Muslim women.“Your identity is not who you think you are, but who others think you are,” Ahmed-Ghosh said. She told the story of how disturbed she felt when the dean of the women’s studies program where she taught asked her to teach a class on women and Islam.Ahmed-Ghosh debunked the commonly believed assertion that the majority of Muslim women live in the Middle East. According to Ahmed-Ghosh, two-thirds of the Muslim women population live in Asia. Indonesia and Pakistan have the highest numbers.Years of research led Ahmed-Ghosh to the conclusion that Middle-Eastern countries are easier to use as examples when teaching about women and Islam because they affi rm political constructs. “Women get used to justify our global agenda,” Ahmed-Ghosh said.An example she used was the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, where politicians often used Islam, specifi cally the treatment of Muslim women, to justify their actions while pushing a political agenda.According to Ahmed-Ghosh, Islamic feminism began around the 1970s to 1980s. Muslim women in countries like Iran were gathering to fi nd ways to relieve some of the oppression they faced in the Muslim community. Women gathered to fi nd verses in the Quran that empowered women so they could use them as a basis to have some of the rules against them taken away.The lecture followed a discussion between the audience and Ahmed-Ghosh. Audience members had the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the issues presented with each other.“Part of the goal of hosting this series of lectures is to support student’s curiosity and give them a forum to engage in dialogue around issues of race, gender and sexuality,” said associate professor of women’s studies Tenya Bakhru.The discussion focused on the issue of control over women all over the world after audience members asked Ahmed-Ghosh to compare the control of women in the U.S. and in Muslim communities.Ahmed-Ghosh drew parallels between the U.S.’s Miss America pageant and honor killings, where in extremely patriarchal societies women are killed if they do something to dishonor their family. She claimed that the coordinators of the Miss America pageant will take the woman’s title if they fi nd out she did something prior to the title that they fi nd embarrassing, like taking nude photos. “It’s important to learn about issues involving women that you don’t see on the news,” said justice studies freshman Ramani Seethamraju. “There are a lot of injustices against women that you never hear about.”Ahmed-Ghosh recently published two edited books titled “Contesting Feminism: Gender and Islam in Asia” and “Asian Muslim Women: Globalization and Local Realities.” She is also on the advisory board of the Center for Islamic and Arabic Studies and the Center for Asia-Pacifi c Studies.

Despite the fact that Holi is a Hindu-based fete, the organizers and participants welcomed all who wanted to join the revelry.In between hoots and hops, dancing members regularly lured outsiders into the heart of the celebration. As participants joined the fete, a more saturated spectrum of powdery colors continued to cloud the air around prancing members. More people emerged from within clouds of lingering neon dust.“We have come far from our home,” said San Jose State alumnus and YUVA member Vishwasu Deshpande. “It’s a really amazing feeling to celebrate. It’s also kind of a responsibility to carry on the culture.”Participants like Deshpande carry on the tradition that continues to be a culturally iconic characteristic of their distant home. Deshpande said it feels like being at home despite the distance.“It allows us to express ourselves in America,” said computer science freshman Hermant Thobbi. “This kind of environment brings us together. We encourage people of other cultures to join us, too.”Thobbi said students traveling to SJSU for academic purposes often find themselves at a loss for friends and connection. Thobbi emphasized the fact that the culturally rich dynamic of Holi is an important part of representation and integration for those that feel lost upon entering a new society.The event also included a feast beforehand where all members had the opportunity to enjoy communal food and drink.Although it incorporated culturally authentic aspects of Hindu celebration, participants approached the event as an opportunity to explore diversity and acceptance by inviting outsiders to join.

CAROLINA IBARRA  | SPARTAN DAILYFollow Carolina on Twitter@xoxoxcaroAs the sound of bagpipes played in the background, bar goers celebrated Saint Patrick’s Day at O’Flaherty’s Irish Pub Friday night. “My drink tonight is Jameson on the rocks,” Goose More, Apple Environment employee said. At 6 p.m. he said he had already finished four drinks of Jameson.Located on the historical San Pedro Square, O’Flaherty’s is one of the handful of Irish pubs downtown. O’Flaherty’s Irish Pub and Five Points were among the most crowded venues on St. Patrick’s Day according to O’Flaherty’s website. The event took place all day starting at 9 a.m. and continuing to 2 a.m.O’Flaherty’s opened in 2002 and has since been one of the top pubs to visit while in town for a Sharks game, according to several attendees. The Irish and American flag hung comfortably next to each other as many Irish Americans celebrated at the pub. Attendees and security guards alike wore green shirts and Guinness hats.Several men wore kilts to embrace the cultural costumes. Although kilts are mainly a Scottish costume and the Irish do not wear them, the Irish Americans do. With families in attendance, there were performances acceptable for all ages. They ranged from Celtic bands to Irish dancers. The performances continued on the second floor of O’Flaherty’s, known as the Tabard Theatre.The Wild Rovers were among the bands performing in the evening.“We’ve played here for eight years, this being our fourth St. Patrick’s Day celebrated here at O’Flaherty’s,” guitarist and singer Martin Sweet said. The Wild Rovers are from Santa Cruz and play traditional Celtic music along with punk.“We have been immersed in the Celtic scene for a long time, about 13 years. We like to play at Irish venues,” Sweet said. The celebration included traditional Irish meals such as corned beef and cabbage, as well as shepherd’s pie.Green beer, Guinness and Jameson, were the drinks of choice for attendees 21 and over.Guests that arrived later in the evening missed several performances but were still able to enjoy the food. “I have seen the performance from the corned beef and cabbage, as well as the Jameson” Randy Foreman, San Jose resident said. “The Jameson performed fl uently.” Children were allowed to attend the event until around 6 p.m. Once the children were away, that was when the real fun started, according to attendees.The festivities extended to the bar owner’s second establishment, Five Points. The two venues are connected through a brick pathway that leads to the patio that joins them. Bar goers swooned and sang along to the traditional music inside Five Points.Inside, a bartender rang a bell and called for shots at random intervals throughout the night.The bartender walked on top of the 20 feet plus bar and poured shots of Jameson down the throats of eager drinkers. The pub was crowded throughout the night and fi lled with people who wanted to drink and celebrate St. Paddy’s day the right way, consuming plenty of Jameson and Guinness. “It’s a great pub and atmosphere for St. Patty’s Day,” Sweet said. “Everybody is Irish on St. Patrick’s day.”BY KYLEE BAIRD AND PAYJE REDMONDSTAFF WRITERSKYLEE BAIRD  | SPARTAN DAILYSheriff Pipes & Drums perform traditional tunes outside of O’Flaherty’s Irish Pub on Friday night as part of the St. Patrick’s Day festivities. Follow Kylee and Payje on Twitter@kyleemakae and @TheyaskedDowntown pub celebrates St. Patrick’s dayIt’s midterm season at San Jose State University and with that Spartapalooza came around. The festival was held in the Student Union Ballroom on Thursday by the Wellness Center. Laurie Morgan, associate director for campus wellness, said the celebration is purposely done around the spring midterm season because of the high levels of stress.“We’ve had probably about 1,200 people come in during the four hours of Spartapalooza and if it’s anything like the past years we do a pretty robust evaluation at the end,” Morgan said. “What I’m most excited about is the question we ask about based on your experience here today are you intending to change any behavior and we see a very significant number of people saying yes.”In addition, Morgan said that every year an invitation is sent out to different clubs and organizations around campus inviting them to set up their booths at Spartapalooza.“The rules are it has to be engaging and interactive and challenge people to maybe think due or be different in their lives,” Morgan said. Throughout the day there were a variety of clubs, organizations and programs informing the SJSU community about their take on wellness as well as demonstrating their talents.“I’m actually here for the San Jose gymnastics club and I’m part of the club so we were here to table,” said Vy Tran, business freshman. “I love just going around and you know being able to explore the new booths and be educated on what they have here.”Kelsey Davis, a psychology junior, was at the event representing Active Minds which is an organization on campus that focuses on trying to reduce the stigma behind mental health. She, along with two other members, had a booth set up with giveaways and information about their organization. “We’re here because mental health really gets overlooked and people just focus on physical health when mental health is really important to your well-being and self functioning,” Davis said.Stress relief was a big part of the fun throughout the day. One of the ways in which students were able to take advantage of these activities was through arts and crafts. There was also a booth in which students were able to make their own stress balls. Health science senior Michael Ayala was one of the people in charge of this activity. He said the main goal behind it was to help improve emotional health. As for the students, there were multiple reasons why they decided to stop in throughout the day. Many had an idea of what they were walking into but others said they had simply never heard of Spartapalooza. “I noticed a poster downstairs in the student union so I decided to check it out and see what they had,” said Lizbeth Millan, graphic design senior. “The tables that I did get to check out overall I enjoyed them because they were very informational but I feel like they should advertise it more that way students can know more about it because there’s great information here.”BY JALENY REYESSTAFF WRITERFollow Jaleny on Twitter@jalenyreyesJALENY REYES  | SPARTAN DAILYMichael Ayala, health science senior, teaches students how to make stress balls during Spartapalooza.

Then, it will take the pieces of your broken heart and make it whole again.Directed by Niki Caro, the ﬁ lm details the true story of Antonina and Jan Żabińska using the Warsaw Zoo as an underground hideout for Jews ﬂ eeing the Nazis’ deadly persecution during World War II. “The Zookeeper’s Wife” premiered in Poland on March 7 and was shown at Cinequest’s closing night on March 12. The ﬁ lm will be released on March 31 in the United States.Based on a nonﬁ ction book of the same name by Diane Ackerman, the ﬁ lm does a wonderful job of telling this tragically-beautiful narrative about the Żabińska family hiding the terriﬁ ed Jews while the presence of Nazis freely roaming the zoo grounds threatens their lives.The movie is reminiscent of famed director Steven Spielberg’s “Schindler’s List,” but takes a serious topic and turns it into an optimistic tale of hope.Jessica Chastain stars as the beautiful, kind and sensitive Antonina, whose love for animals brims with an innocence that’s reminiscent of one’s childhood.The movie welcomes the audience with Antonina happily opening the gates to eager visitors of the Warsaw Zoo. She then rides her bicycle around the zoo and greets each animal, from cheerful monkeys to ferocious lions that seem happy to welcome their human friend’s presence each morning.Antonina lives with her husband Jan, played by Johan Heldenbergh, and son Ryszard, ﬁ rst played by Timothy Radford and later Val Maloku, in a peaceful villa on the zoo grounds.During the day, their villa remains empty as all three members of the Zabinski family busily tend to the needs of the animals under their care. At night, the couple hosts friends at the villa and Antonina entertains them by playing various songs on her piano.At one of these dinner parties, we meet Lutz Heck, played by Daniel Brühl. Heck is a German zoologist who joins the Nazi Party and later becomes a breeder that attempts to bring back extinct animals. While the party is underway, Antonina discovers that one of her elephants had given birth and the calf was not breathing. Immediately, she runs to the elephant pen. Showing no concerns for the cleanliness of her white evening gown, she kneels down and successfully resuscitates the calf much to the joy and surprise of her dinner guests who witnessed the act.In this particular scene, I wondered if I was watching Chastain acting or Antonina actually reviving the calf.Upon ﬁ rst glance, you wouldn’t know that Chastain was playing a role in a movie. The desperation that Chastain shows is clearly projected in her acting. Seeing that in her performance, I had never wanted to yell, “Wake up!” at an elephant with such passion and urgency.Antonina’s selﬂ ess act in this scene serves as the introduction to the level of compassion that Antonina shows not just toward the animals in the zoo, but later to Jews secretly rescued from the ghettos. Later on, Heck tells the Żabińska family that their animals will be killed. Though heartbroken, Antonina cannot object until Heck offers to take the animals to a German zoo.Seeing this as an opportunity to save her beloved animals, she agrees only to ﬁ nd out that Heck wanted to take only the exotic animals to use in his Nazi breeding program.With the zoo now empty and wanting to prevent innocent Jews from perishing, Jan and Antonina devise a plan and use the zoo as an underground sanctuary under the guise of a pig farm. Each day, Jan drives a large truck meant to carry food waste from the ghettos to the now-farm to feed the pigs. Each day, he brings back more Jews by hiding them in the truck.One particular character that painfully stands out is a young girl that Jan spots during his ﬁ rst trip to the ghettos. The girl is forcefully herded into a dark corner by two German guards.A wave of anxiety hit me as the guard’s predatory teasing and the girl’s terriﬁ ed body language told me that something horrible was about to happen to her.Jan’s worrisome expression heightened this feeling, much to Heldenbergh’s credit. The frustrated helplessness on Heldenbergh’s face is palpable and I began to feel genuine concern for the girl’s safety.From there, the movie turns into a dangerous game of hide-and-seek, with the Jews hiding and remaining silent whenever Antonina plays her piano to warn them when the Nazis enter the villa.Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie 75 percent. I opine that this score doesn’t do the movie justice.I give “The Zookeeper’s Wife” 100 percent or ﬁ ve stars. The movie breathes life into a poignant story that takes depressing elements from Holocaust movies like “Schindler’s List” and adds just enough hope to give the movie a level of optimism rarely found in today’s cinematic drama.‘The Zookeeper’s Wife’ will leave you weepingBY NICOLE CHUNGPRODUCTION EDITORFollow Nicole on Twitter@njhchungMOVIE REVIEWSan Jose State University’s Persian Studies program celebrated the arrival of spring at the annual Norouz Concert on Sunday at the Student Union Theater. The concert featured master santour player Mahvash Guerami and singer Hossein Masoudi who serenaded the audience with traditional folk and classical Iranian songs.The concert is held annually to celebrate Norouz, a traditional holiday in Iran and other middle eastern countries marked by the vernal equinox. Norouz means “new day” and Iranians all over the world gather with friends and family to welcome a new year and celebrate with music, dance and traditional Iranian dishes.“It’s an acknowledgement that you have just passed through a dark, cold winter and you want to reinvigorate yourself,” said director of Persian studies Persis Karim.The audience heard a variety of traditional Iranian folk and classical songs that featured the strong sounds of the tompak, a goblet-shaped drum, and the melodic sounds of the Iranian santour, a string instrument. A staple of traditional Iranian music, the santour is a trapezoidal shaped box with strings stretched over it that sits on a f lat surface and is played with two light hammers.“The songs in the first half were primarily a celebration of spring and the inspiration that comes from the growth, f lowers and the change from the old to the new,” said vocalist Hossein Massoudi.Massoudi said the second half consisted of folk music from different regions of Iran which resulted in a more spontaneous performance.The concert was divided into two parts with a short intermission in between during which the audience could enjoy tea and cookies in the lobby decorated with a haft-sinn, a tabletop arrangement decorated with symbolic foods and spring related items.Foods placed on the haft-sinn are symbolic of renewal for the new year and included: sprouts growing in a dish symbolizing rebirth, wheat germ pudding to suggest affluence, an apple to represent health and beauty, garlic for medicine, olives as a symbol of love, fruit to represent the color of sunrise and vinegar to symbolize patience. According to Nazy Kaviani, founder of Diaspora Arts Connection, Norouz has been a time of celebration for people of Persian heritage for thousands of years.The origin of Norouz can be traced back to Zoroastrianism, a monotheistic religion that originated in Iran an estimated 3,000 years ago.“It was very important for us to have this reception for the multiple generations of the Iranian community in Northern California,” Kaviani said.Norouz is also a time to show respect and appreciation for friends and family. Young people and children pay respect to their elders by visiting them and elders gift them little envelopes with money.Karim pointed out that Norouz is a pre-Islamic and pre-Christian holiday, meaning that Iranians of any religion take part in the Norouz celebrations.“On this day we try to forget about everything and just be happy and forget about the past,” said Spanish graduate student Saba Jalali.BY SELINA RAMIREZSTAFF WRITERFollow Selina on Twitter@selina_ramirez_SELINA RAMIREZ  | SPARTAN DAILYPersis Karim presents Mahvash Guerami with fl owers after her performance at the annual Norouz concert.Norouz concert kicks off Persian New Year FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA@spartandailyOPINION 5Tuesday, March 21, 2017           Mar 16Complete the grid so that every row, column and 3x3 box contains every digit from 1 to 9 inclusively.

It occurs towards the end of the movie when LeFou dances with a man in drag. In an interview with People Magazine, actor Josh Gad, who plays LeFou, describes it as “subtle but incredibly effective.” While some may applaud Disney for taking this step, others are not happy about the scene. The short clip has stirred up some controversy.According to People Magazine, Henagar Drive-In Theater in Alabama refused to screen the movie. The theater took to Facebook to explain its choice. “When companies continually force their views on us we need to take a stand,” a Henagar Drive-In Theater representative said. “If I can’t sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me then we have no business showing it.”USA Today reported that Russia has restricted any children under age 16 from seeing the movie.Russian lawmaker Vitaly Milonov stated in a letter that the film spreads “overt and shameless propaganda of sin and sexual perversion under the guise of a fairy tale.”Gad explained why the scene has been causing so much debate.In his interview with People Magazine he talked about how people are afraid of what they don’t understand.Malaysian theaters asked Disney to cut the “gay moment.” According to Bloomberg News, Disney stated in an email that “the film has not been cut and will not be cut for Malaysia.”Sure, it’s great that Disney has decided to include a gay character in a classic film but many, including me, feel as though this is not the representation they want to see.For those millennials who haven’t watched “Beauty and the Beast” since the 90s, LeFou is the goofy butterball who follows Gaston around for most of the movie. With a name that translates to “the fool,” LeFou is, at best, a secondary character in the plot of the movie.To give such a small role such a significant characteristic almost feels like an afterthought.According to The Star, Toronto podcaster Jensine Jones felt this way. “At this point in 2017, praising a large corporation for doing the least possible in terms of including LGBTQ characters is a bit ridiculous,” Jones said.The Star also reported that Nicholas Sammond, associate professor of cinema studies at the University of Toronto, was skeptical of Disney’s choice. “It’s a little too late, and a little too little, but it’s better than nothing,” Sammond said.Some may ask me, being a straight cisgender woman, who am I to argue on this topic?Well call me crazy but I just feel like the LGBTQ community deserves “better than nothing.” Where is the lesbian Disney princess or the transgender Disney hero?These are the representations that need to be seen, that need to be expunged of their “restricted” label.This is what it comes down to — it’s 2017. It’s about time Disney gives the LGBTQ community a proper representation. So be our guest and catch up with the times Disney.JENNIFER BALLARDOSTAFF WRITERFollow Jennifer on Twitter@jayembee1Disney’s fi rst gay character is still in the closetOPINIONWe may consider those in politics as powerful people, but we must also remember that everyday people also have power. They have the right to question and hold officials accountable for their actions while they go about their everyday life. On March 11, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was berated by former Florida teacher Shree Chauhan while visiting an Apple store in Washington D.C. Attempting to purchase an Apple watch, Spicer was approached by Chauhan who berated him with questions. “How does it feel to work for a fascist?” Chauhan said, recording Spicer on her phone. “Do you feel good about lying to the American people?” Chauhan is a perfect example of what one should do if anyone ever encounters a member of the public and political power.As the voice and face of the White House, the executive branch and the president, Spicer has repeatedly spoken to the media and blatantly lied to the American public. He exaggerated the numbers of attendees and viewers for Trump’s inauguration.On Jan. 21 regarding general inauguration attendance, Spicer said, “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.”He falsified details regarding a failed raid in Yemen as well as a mall shooting in Canada, saying that the shooting was carried out by a terrorist.“The action taken in Yemen was a huge success,” Spicer said in a press briefing shortly after the counterterrorism raid. “American lives will be saved because of it. Future attacks will be prevented.”With each false statement, never once did he provide proof to back the claims. It is reasonable to be outraged by anyone in such a powerful position who gives false information to the American public. What Chauhan did was exactly what everyone should be able to do — hold people in power accountable for their actions. One can argue that Spicer deserved some kind of privacy since he was not in front of the press and was running errands. However, we must remember that public officials and public figures never really have days off work.Spicer agreed to this job and took the oath of office to be the press secretary. His job is to answer any and all questions that are directed toward him, therefore he should answer the people of the United States as well as the press. During the time that Chauhan was berating him with questions, Spicer simply smiled as he tried to ignore her. He did not answer any of her questions. He only replied by thanking her for the questions. In the 50-second video, Spicer is heard saying “such a great country that allows you to be here.” Chauhan is of Indian descent and was born in the U.S. In an interview with Time, she discussed feeling scared about the meaning of his comments. “That is racism and it is an implied threat,” she said.“Think about the sheer audacity of Mr. Spicer to say that to my face with a smile, knowing that he is being recorded on video and the position of power he holds in our government,” Chauhan said on Medium. “I am still stunned by the boldness of having my citizenship threatened on camera.”Chauhan wrote a lengthy article regarding her experience with Spicer via Medium and included the video she took of the encounter.Some of the criticism that she received online was how rude and disrespectful she was while questioning Spicer. Commenter John New on Medium called her a “rabid violent anti-police anti-American Marxist.”New completely missed the point of her statement and video.Meanwhile, being in the spotlight of a politically tense environment can be ruthless.  However, this is what he signed up for when he accepted the position and took the oath of office.No matter how rude or disrespectful she may have been, she followed through with her civic responsibility.It’s evident that there is political inequality in our country. People who are not part of the 1 percent don’t have access to talk or meet with politicians. When faced with someone in a position of power, anyone should be able to take the opportunity to question and hold them accountable no matter how rude or disrespectful one may be perceived.Chauhan’s actions exemplified how constituents should hold political officials accountable whether they’re in Washington D.C., their state capital, or not. Tuesday, March 21, 2017 Follow Elizabeth on Twitter@elizabwithloveOn March 11, White House press secretary Sean Spicer walked into an Apple store in Washington, D.C. on his day off. He was met with a wave of hardball questions from activist and Trump critic Shree Chauhan.Liberal news sources have called this a confrontation. Conservative news sources have labeled this harassment.Despite being a bleeding heart liberal, I have to side with the conservatives. What Chauhan did is nothing more than plain old harassment.Before you angrily throw stones at me, let me make this perfectly clear: I absolutely detest Sean Spicer, along with most of President Donald Trump’s administration.That said, if we see public figures like Spicer out on the streets, we should never resort to harassing them.Yes, even if what they stand for threatens the livelihoods of millions of people in America.We liberals claim to fight against the harassment of other people and any forms of violation against basic human rights. Yet here we are, practicing the very actions that we preach against in our stances, speeches and marches.I say this and criticize Chauhan’s method of dealing with Spicer because I know that as progressives, we are better than this.We’ve done a fine job of maintaining civility in marches like the Women’s March on Washington and peaceful protests like A Day Without a Woman.Through peaceful protests and marches, we sent a clear message to the world that we will fight against bigotry without needing to utilize harassment and violence against those who stand against progress.Yet the moment we resort to rioting and looting, our message becomes lost. We become a part of the buzzing, nonstop noise, not the unified voice that rises above it.I know that there is a good chance that conservative pundits will likely use Chauhan’s harassment of Spicer as a weapon against progressive ideals. They’ll paint her as a villain with ulterior motives and Spicer as an innocent victim. This always happens.For example, look at how mainstream media portrayed the Black Lives Matter protests whenever some of them turned into violent riots.According to its website, BLM is “an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise… an affi rmation of Black folks’ contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.”Not once have leaders and supporters of BLM said that the lives of African-Americans matter more than the lives of other races and ethnicities, despite what has been falsely claimed by its opponents.But the rioting and overall violence seen in some of these BLM protests, like the one that took place in Ferguson, Mich. back in August 2014, only serve to undermine the overall message of this necessary movement.The movement has been accused by critics both in mainstream media and social media of being, among other things, violent without a cause and harboring and creating anti-police sentiments.Regarding how outsiders view this movement, I think Rev. Barbara Reynolds, a notable civil rights activist in the 1960s, put it best. “It is difficult to distinguish legitimate activists from the mob actors who burn and loot,” Rev. Reynolds said. “Even if the BLM activists aren’t the ones participating in the boorish language and dress, neither are they condemning it.”I deeply hate to say this, but I can somewhat understand why those who truly don’t understand the purpose of BLM accuse it of being a black-only movement run by “hoodlums.” I know that’s not true. But again, it’s somewhat easy to see why critics might think this way of the movement given its actions in recent years.Let this be a lesson to all current and future activists that the moment you incorporate harassment, rioting and overall violence into your message, it will fall upon deaf ears which only leads to the misinterpretation of your stance.So leave Sean Spicer alone. Stop harassing him. Don’t give the other side a chance to turn trivial things like this into legitimate reasons to belittle the progressive social and political platforms. Don’t let your message be lost because you deserve to be heard.We know we are better than this. Now it’s time to prove it to the world.NICOLE CHUNGSTAFF WRITERELIZABETH RODRIGUEZSTAFF WRITERHate crimes have been on the rise and in the spotlight since the election of President Donald Trump.They were at a peak in the days directly following the election, but have continued to persist according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Some schools, community centers, businesses, homes and places of worship have been targets of hate-inspired vandalism.However, none of this is new. Hatred and bigotry have sadly become as American as apple pie and baseball. Hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan have existed for over a century and have seen numerous surges in membership throughout their history. The most recent of which coincided with the election of former president Barack Obama and the hatred that white nationalist groups had for him.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2008 the number of hate groups rose to 926, up 4 percent from 2007.Now hate groups are experiencing another boom in membership and activity.However, this time it is not because the president is the embodiment of everything that groups like the KKK and Neo-Nazis hate.No, this time it’s quite the contrary.These hate groups have become more emboldened since Nov. 8. They see the election of Trump — a xenophobic, Islamophobic, demagogue that spewed hate speech all along the campaign trail — as somehow legitimizing their beliefs and validating their actions.As a community, we must band around our neighbors that are the most vulnerable to hate in the current political climate. We must protect minority group members such as our LGBTQ, African-American, Muslim, Immigrant and Jewish brothers and sisters. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, they are the five most targeted groups.Right now, it is merely spray paint and broken glass.  However, history has shown us the atrocities that those types of actions can lead to with time.  All across the country there have been highly publicized attacks against the LGBTQ community.In February, the Los Angeles LGBT Center was vandalized with the words, “F**k Trannies” spray-painted on the walls. Milwaukee’s Diverse & Resilient center was similarly vandalized during the same month.Earlier in March Indianapolis Metropolitan Police arrested a man that walked into a gay bar and told employees that he was going to commit a Pulse-nightclub-style shooting there.Then on Sunday March 12, in Washington D.C., drop-in center and advocacy organization Casa Ruby was attacked by a man who destroyed its front door and assaulted one of its employees.Casa Ruby has been helping transgender Latinas and LGBT immigrants in the Washington D.C. community since its founding in 2004.The Southern Poverty Law Center, which has specialized in fighting hatred and bigotry for nearly 45 years, reported 109 cases of hate inspired intimidation, harassment, violence and vandalism perpetrated against the LGBTQ community from Nov. 9 to Dec. 12 alone.   However, these hate-groups’ animosity is by no means exclusive to the LGBTQ community.According to the Southern Poverty Law Center there have been more than 1,000 incidents of hate-based crimes in the U.S. since the election of President Trump.The most popular examples of these 1,000 plus crimes were motivated by anti-immigrant, anti-African-American, anti-Muslim, anti-LGBTQ and Neo-Nazi sentiments.With statistics like these, it is impossible to separate the election of Donald Trump and the rise in hate-inspired incidents that we are seeing today.The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that of the 1,094 incidents it compiled information on, nearly 40 percent mentioned Trump, his campaign slogans or his remarks about sexually assaulting women.This is an issue that bridges gaps and identities. It is more than a LGBTQ issue, or an African-American issue, or a Muslim issue. This is a human issue.We should be prepared and willing to protect our fellow man against the forces that wish to tear us apart nationally.Follow Nicole on Twitter@njhchungFollow David on Twitter@davidtaub3DAVID TAUBSTAFF WRITER “ “As a community, we must band around our neighbors that are the most vulnerable to hate in the current polical climate.Hate crimes are rising since Trump’s electionIs it okay to pester public fi gures while they shop?They gave up the private life We can do better than harassing people“Leave Sean Spicer alone.

So it was everyone doing their job and a little bit more. Luckily, we kept them down to three which is a team goal for us.”SJSU senior goalkeeper Tayler Peters had a strong performance in the cage with a season-high 13 saves including a 5-meter defense against a penalty shot by Harvard in the second half.The Spartans kept the pressure on the Crimson throughout the match which helped prevent any open shots for Harvard. It ultimately led to a season-low three goals which was the second time this season that Harvard was held at three goals.“Again, we kept a ranked team under three goals which is always good,” head coach Gabor Sarusi said. “Our defense helped us out. If we can keep a low scoring game that always helps us to have a good chance to win the game.” Although the Spartans had several missed goal attempts, the Spartans controlled the ball for a majority of the match with senior Cara Robinson and sophomore Shelia Jensen each scoring two goals in the fi rst half.SJSU junior Klaudia Paradi ended the game with a goal in the fourth quarter which was the final nail in the coffin for Harvard.“I think we came out, like we should have been a little bit more aggressive [and] a little bit better on our fi nishes,” SJSU goalkeeper Tayler Peters said. “Our defense was pretty solid. They helped me out on defense. It was just that our shots weren’t going in.” The Spartans have won three of their last fi ve games and are trying to maintain the momentum of this two-game winning streak as they prepare to face the No. 1 ranked University of Southern California for their next match. USC has a season record of 21-0 and just set a national record for achieving a 48th consecutive win over Hawaii.“We need focus and intensity in practice,” Peters said. “We need to change our intensity in practice so that way we can actually have it in the game and not come out so slow.”SJSU will need to perform at its best in order to have a chance to defeat the women’s water polo powerhouse and bring home the win.Of the team’s 20 games against ranked opponents, it has only won seven but a victory over the Trojans would could help its chances at a postseason run and would likely bump its position up in the national rankings.San Jose State is set to go up against USC in a Mountain Pacific Sports Federation match on Saturday, March 25 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center in Los Angeles at 1 p.m.SJSU wins Top-20 water polo matchup against HarvardBY MARGARET GUTIERREZSTAFF WRITERMARGARET GUTIERREZ | SPARTAN DAILYSan Jose State junior driver Klaudia Paradi powers up as she attempts to strike the ball into the back of the net.We need to change our intensity in practice so that way we can actually have it in the game and not come out so slow.“ “Tayler PetersSJSU goalkeeperVICTORYFollow Margaret on Twitter@maggieslaraMARGARET GUTIERREZ | SPARTAN DAILYThe Spartans gather around head coach Gabor Sarusi during a timeout as he looks to make adjustments.SPORTS8The Spartans’ pair of walk-off hits and freshman Kellen Strahm’s continued tear produced San Jose State’s fi rst in-conference series sweep in fi ve years.The SJSU baseball team (9-9, 5-4 MW) broke its four-game losing streak and won two contests via walk-off in the Spartans’ three-game series sweep of the Nevada Wolf Pack (5-15, 2-7 MW).The biggest story from the weekend was Strahm.With hits in 16 of the Spartans’ 18 games this year, the freshman centerfi elder has been on an incredible stretch and holds a 15-game hit streak. Strahm batted .428 this weekend with a .500 on base percentage.“Kellen has been our offensive weapon all season,” said head coach Jason Hawkins. “He is strong.”With the three victories, SJSU completed the team’s fi rst Mountain West sweep since 2012.The Spartans entered the weekend on a four-game losing streak and needed to fi nd any semblance of consistency on the mound. Enter ace Josh Nashed. Game 1The righty was coming off one of the worst performances of his career when he was tourched for 10 earned runs over four innings against the top team in the conference, New Mexico.Nashed was solid on the hill through four innings Friday, holding the Wolf Pack to one run. Hawkins said on Friday that all he wanted was for his starters to give the offense a shot. Despite getting blown out of New Mexico last weekend, the offense still performed respectably, it was the pitching staff that let the team down.“We knew Josh was going to be pretty good tonight,” Hawkins said.While Nashed thrived, the pen struggled, giving up a four-run lead late which allowed Nevada to gain the momentum. But once the game was tied, closer Joseph Balfour and reliever Jaiden France slammed the door as the game went deep into the night. Thus led to the fi rst of the three unlikely heroes of the weekend, outfi elder Kyle Blakeman.The junior outfi elder has struggled this season, but broke out of his slump with a game-winning single off the wall with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 12th inning. “It felt really good,” Blakeman said. “There is nothing like it, it is the greatest feeling in the world.”SJSU 6, UNR 5 12 inningsGame 2Saturday, the Spartans looked to keep the momentum from Friday night’s slump buster and take the series from the Wolf Pack.Starter Matt Brown, who has struggled with his command all season, kept Nevada at bay throughout the afternoon. Aided by a fi ve-run fi rst inning, Brown was — as assistant coach Dean Stiles said — “effectively wild,” scattering 12 base-runners over fi ve innings, allowing only two runs.However, it was the relievers who found themselves with control problems.Righty Josh Goldberg was tasked with closing out the game since Balfour had thrown two innings the night before and had a nightmare of a ninth inning. Goldberg gave up four runs, two came off errors by second baseman Kyle Morrison and third baseman Michael Breen.Hawkins then called on the veteran right-hander Hilario Tovar, who had only appeared in six innings this season and on the Wolf Pack comeback. SJSU 7, UNR 6Game 3SJSU came into Sunday’s game with two goals — sweep the series and keep momentum. To this point, the Spartans spent the entire weekend without trailing for a single inning. This made Nevada’s run-scoring double down the line in the fi fth inning, giving the Wolf Pack a 4-3 lead, a wake up call to the offense. The Spartans struggled without the lead, pressing at-bats and forcing weak attempts at bad pitches. However, veteran Chris Williams fl ipped the script in the bottom of the eighth, blasting a fi rst-pitch fastball over the right-fi eld wall, tying the game.But this wasn’t the biggest moment of the game. In the top of 10th inning, the Wolf Pack took the lead off reliever Zach Tanner.Nashed then stepped up for his biggest moment of the weekend, as he took a 1-1 fastball and deposited it into the Spartans’ bullpen over the left-fi eld wall. This sent the SJSU dugout into a state of euphoria and from then on, the game was in the Spartans’ hands. Nevada’s bullpen fell apart and pinch runner Corey Olivet scored the game-winning run on a wild pitch just four batters later.SJSU 6, UNR 5 in 10 inningsNext up for SJSU is a non-conference matchup against the University of Pacifi c in Stockton on March 21 at 6 p.m.SJSU whips out the broomsHOME COOKINGBY KAVIN MISTRYTHE SPEARPHOTOS BY KAVIN MISTRY | THE SPEARTOP LEFT: The Spartans gather around outfi elder Kyle Blakeman after he hit a walk-off single in the 12th inning that ended SJSU’s four game losing streak on Friday.

Spartan Kaprece Nadonza came in second for bars and Kaitlin Won earned third place for SJSU, career-bests for both of the gymnasts.In beam, SJSU’s Taylor Chan tied for third with Sacramento State’s Caitlin Soliwoda for a score of 9.9. Chan, after winning seven MPSF Freshman of the Week awards throughout the season, was named this year’s MPSF Freshman of the Year on Saturday night.“It’s kind of crazy,” Chan said. “I’ve never been anything bigger than what this is.”Chan also won fi rst place for the fl oor with a score of 9.875, marking her sixth consecutive win or tie competing in fl oor events. She tied with UC Davis junior Alexis Brown who was the fi rst place winner in the all-around category.“We have a young team,” Wright said. “Taylor Chan is a freshman and she did an amazing job tonight.”SJSU received the most competition from title runner-up UC Davis which came in close with 195.725 and Sacramento State which scored 195.175.“We knew coming in this meet was going to be a shoot-out,” Wright said. “Davis is a good team and Sac is too.” The Spartans won in vault with a score of a 48.8 and tied for fi rst on bars with Sac State with a score of 49.2, the third-highest mark in school history. They came in second on beam earning 49.1 points, just under UC Davis’ 49.225 score. For team fl oor, SJSU came in third at 48.825 points, losing to Sac and Davis which won fi rst and second respectively. “That’s the thing in gymnastics,” Wright said. “A little bit is a lot.” The NCAA Regionals will be held in Seattle on April 1.
