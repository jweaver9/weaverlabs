These astonishing numbers, largely driven by hackers whotarget large corporations,7 exist alongside smaller but even more damag-ing data breaches.In December 2015, hackers publicly leaked the personal informationof 4,926 users of Hzone, a dating app for HIV-positive singles, includingtheir names, sexual orientations, dates of birth, and email addresses,along with the inference that the users of this app were HIV-positive.8Although hackers frequently steal private data for financial gain,they may also have more sinister intentions. Gay and bisexual men com-prise 67% of all HIV-positive people in the United States9 despite beingonly 2.2% of the overall population.10 Hackers can easily make the con-nection that while HIV status is a protected class under federal lawsagainst employment and public accommodations discrimination,11 sexualorientation is not, and therefore any hint of an individual’s sexual orien-tation can be used against the person.

These sources presented stories thatpainted bleak pictures for gay men in countries like Saudi Arabia, wherebeing caught participating in same-sex sexual activity is punishable bydeath.19 Global News contrasted this outcome with the consequencesfaced by breach victims in the United States, who face “damaged or de-stroyed marriages, or the loss of a security clearance.”20 The conse-quences also included two suicides in Canada,21 but the prospect of thedeath penalty for the possession of an account on a website is extreme.2015 stated, “Ashley Madison is the most famous name in infidelity and married dating.” Theirinfamous slogan was “Life is Short, Have an Affair.” As of the time of this publication, AshleyMadison had rebranded itself as “the world’s largest, most open-minded dating community.”See Kim Zetter, Hackers Finally Post Stolen Ashley Madison Data, WIRED (Aug. 18, 2015, 5:55PM), https://www.wired.com/2015/08/happened-hackers-posted-stolen-ashley-madison-data/;ABOUT ASHLEY MOMENTS, https://blog.ashleymadison.com/about/ (last visited Feb. 4, 2017).13 Zetter, supra note 12.14 See Associated Press, Two Suicides Linked to Ashley Madison Breach, N.Y.

Because of the leak from the Down Low site, thegeneral public had full access to data that connected names of individualswith their sexual orientation. Anyone can easily search for any individ-ual, who then may face discrimination due to the lack of legal protectionsfor LGBTQ people in the United States.The team of hackers behind the Ashley Madison breach believed thesite to be morally wrong.22 Personal definitions of morality greatly influ-ence the minds of many Americans and cause people to discriminateagainst those they consider immoral.23 The Impact Team expressed theirintent before publishing the breached data: “[t]oo bad for those men,they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion.”24Moral wrongness has engrained itself into American civil rights leg-islation, as well. Only 22 states and the District of Columbia have en-acted legislation protecting lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals fromdiscrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.25Only 19 states and the District of Columbia have those same full protec-tions for transgender people.26 In states without these protections,LGBTQ people can be fired, not hired, denied housing, evicted, or re-moved from retail establishments solely on account of their sexual orien-tation or gender identity. Therefore, data breaches like Ashley Madison,which publicly released names and information about sexual orientationor gender identity, pose a grave threat of discrimination to millions ofLGBTQ Americans.Although there has not yet been a reported case of discriminationthat has been explicitly linked to breached health information, the poten-tial for future discrimination, driven by animus, is limitless. This mayseem to be a mere hypothetical considering the lack of concrete exam-ples, but actual human beings’ jobs, homes, and safety are at risk asshown by the response and backlash from the recent advancements inLGBTQ rights.22 IMPACT TEAM MANIFESTO, http://pastebin.com/3SepJr8Q (last visited Feb. 4, 2017).23 Jennifer Stuber, Ilan Meyer & Bruce Link, Stigma, Prejudice, Discrimination and Health 6(2008) (unpublished manuscript) (on file with Pub Med Central, National Institute of Health), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006697/pdf/nihms338971.pdf (published at 67 SOC.

Part I-B provides an overview of the current laws that protect a patient’s rightto privacy, including HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Ec-onomic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and the Patient Protectionand Affordable Care Act (ACA). Emphasis will be placed on healthcareneeds specific to the LGBTQ population and why that has led to a pushfor sexual orientation and gender identity information being collectedfrom patients and remedies for breach victims. Part II argues that theresults of health data breaches will lead to discrimination and the sup-pression of substantive due process rights of LGBTQ individuals. Part IIwill also provide a comprehensive legislative and regulatory plan as wellas judicial suggestions to both prevent future data breaches and providethe LGBTQ population additional avenues of remedy. Part III concludesby considering the implications of these suggested changes.I. BACKGROUNDIn order to understand the need for stronger protections against databreaches and hacking to protect LGBTQ people, the development of over50 years of anti-discrimination laws and over 20 years of health dataprivacy laws must be reviewed. A basic understanding of these laws isparamount to implementing change. This section reviews civil rights leg-islation in the United States at the federal and state levels, notes moderntrends in those substantive protections, discusses injuries when sufficientprotections do not exist, and explains the federal scheme of health dataprotection laws.5Lemberg: Hackers Made Me Lose My Job!Published by GGU Law Digital Commons, 2017180 GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47A. FEDERAL AND STATE CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS PROTECTING LGBTQPEOPLEThe legal scheme for protecting LGBTQ people in the United Statesis a complicated mash-up of mixed-motive laws, confusing SupremeCourt and appellate court decisions, and conflicting executive actions.The most important legislation and regulations will be discussed in orderto acquaint the reader with the tumultuous history of LGBTQ rights.1. Federal LawsOne of the greatest legislative victories in Twentieth CenturyAmerica was the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This landmarklaw banned discrimination on the grounds of race, color, religion, andnational origin.27 Specifically, Title II of the Civil Rights Act banneddiscrimination in public accommodations, such as hotels, restaurants, re-tail establishments, and entertainment facilities that engaged in interstatecommerce.28 Similarly, the Civil Rights Act’s Title VII protected thesame classes from discrimination in employment.29 Four years later,Congress added protections against housing discrimination in Title VIIIof the Civil Rights Act of 1968.30 Fifty years have elapsed since thepassage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and yet lesbians, gay men, bisex-uals, transgender people, and queer people still do not have similar pro-tections under federal law.The fight for LGBTQ equality and civil rights began in earnestshortly after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. During theAugust 1966 Compton’s Cafeteria riot in San Francisco, police raided atransgender gathering place in San Francisco’s Tenderloin District, re-sulting in a riot.31 The rioters became known as the “Screaming Queens”and provided the first glimpse of a major movement.32 On June 28, 1969,the New York Police Department discriminatorily raided New York’s27 See Civil Rights Act of 1964 § 201(a), 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(a) (2015).28 See Civil Rights Act of 1964 § 201(b), 42 U.S.C. § 2000a(b) (2015).29 See Civil Rights Act of 1964 § 703(a), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) (2015).30 See Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act) § 804, 42 U.S.C. § 3604 (2015).31 Ryan Kost, The Riot that Predated Stonewall, 50 Years Later, S.F.

President Obama signedExecutive Order 13672 in December 2014, which extended employmentdiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people working as federal employ-ees, contractors, or subcontractors.44 Additionally, the Equal Employ-ment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) found in two separate appealsbefore administrative judges that discrimination against an individual be-cause of sexual orientation and gender identity is sex discriminationunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.45 While this does, intheory, apply to all private employment, the EEOC’s precedents aremerely persuasive to federal courts hearing employment discriminationrelated cases.46 Other areas, such as public accommodations, have nofederal protections currently.47 Simply stated, current federal laws do notsufficiently protect LGBTQ people from discrimination; without a will-ing Congress, LGBTQ people must rely on states to pass and enforcethese laws. This lack of protection by federal laws will lead to databreach victims facing discrimination. In some cases, state laws can fillthe gaps in federal protections, but many states still do not offer anyprotection at all.2. State LawsStates vary drastically in regard to the amount of LGBTQ anti-dis-crimination protections offered under state law. The extreme ends of thespectrum are represented by California and Tennessee/North Carolina.California has some of the strongest protections in the United States forLGBTQ people, while Tennessee and North Carolina have passed lawsto restrict liberty of LGBTQ individuals.

CaliforniaCalifornia has full anti-discrimination protections under employ-ment,48 housing,49 and public accommodations,50 meaning that in all as-pects of public life, LGBTQ people cannot be discriminated against andmust receive the same benefits under California law as all other people.California residents have the right to bring civil suits for damages orequitable relief against violators of these laws, meaning they can file alawsuit against anyone who takes their rights away in any fashion.51California also has a history of leadership in passing progressive leg-islation. Currently, California allows transgender children to use therestrooms of their choice and play sports on teams that accord with theirpreferred gender identity.52 California also prohibits LGBTQ-discrimina-tory education in public schools.53Many municipalities within the state of California offer additionalprotections to LGBTQ people. For example, the City and County of SanFrancisco created a countywide agency called the Human Rights Com-mission, which began authoring legislation protecting transgender andgender nonconforming people in 1995.54 The Human Rights Commis-sion also has the power to investigate and mediate “community-wideproblems . . . which may result in intergroup tensions ordiscrimination.”55b. Tennessee and North CarolinaIt is a true test of federalism to compare local ordinances in SanFrancisco to laws in states such as Tennessee and North Carolina. Ten-nessee does not have any state employment, housing, or public accom-modations protections for its LGBTQ residents, and the state went onestep further by banning local anti-discrimination ordinances.

Evans, which invalidated aColorado constitutional amendment that banned local LGB anti-discrimi-nation ordinances because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of theFourteenth Amendment.59 The difference between the Colorado amend-ment in Romer and the laws in Tennessee and North Carolina is the fo-cus — the Colorado amendment explicitly singled out LGBTQ people,while the Tennessee and North Carolina laws purported to protect localbusinesses from the economic burden of anti-discrimination laws.60 TheAmerican Civil Liberties Union and other progressive organizations fileda lawsuit to repeal the North Carolina law.61 The case is currently pend-ing before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, following a federal judgegranting a partial preliminary injunction.62Now more than ever, the fear of adding LGBTQ rights is being de-scribed as a religious moral issue. Franklin Graham, son of famoustelevangelist Billy Graham, stated on his website that HB 2 in NorthCarolina “isn’t only an important issue of privacy and safety, this is amoral issue.”63 His bold statement shows the dangerous role religionmay play in suppressing the rights of those they view differently, like theLGBTQ population.Because of the wide variances between states with maximum protec-tions and states that have legalized discrimination, differing levels of in-juries due to discrimination are bound to occur.

INJURIES DUE TO DISCRIMINATIONThere is a paucity of academic research on the actual effects of dis-crimination on the LGBTQ population as a whole, despite academicsexpending significant resources on researching specialized areas, such asimpact on LGBT youth, employment discrimination, and mentalhealth.64 Health data breaches present a new and unwelcome way of re-leasing private sexual orientation data to the public, which could lead togreater levels of discrimination if it falls into the wrong hands. Someconcrete findings regarding LGBTQ discrimination are presented below.A Harvard researcher sent out 1,769 pairs of fictitious resumes toemployers hiring entry-level employees for white-collar companies inseven states, which represent different regions of the United States.65 Theresumes sent in this study were identical, except for one line in one re-sume stating experience in a university campus LGBT group and theother omitting that line.66 This study presents a sociological perspectivethat shows direct evidence of discrimination, as opposed to the effects ofthe discrimination as shown from the perspective of public health.

No states in the South offer protections,and only Minnesota, Iowa, and Illinois offer legal protections for allLGBTQ people within the Midwest.69 In contrast, four of five states bor-dering the Pacific Ocean offer full protections and all states in New En-gland offer some type of protection.70 The study analyzed nationwidetrends rather than state legal protections and consequently focused onemployment callback discrimination, which is harder for individuals toenforce than on-the-job discrimination.71Transgender people face even more pervasive discrimination in em-ployment and other areas, as shown by a nationwide survey of 6,450transgender or gender nonconforming individuals from all 50 states.72Nine out of ten transgender individuals reported being harassed or dis-criminated against at work in some way; 47% experienced an adverse jobaction; and 26% were fired simply for being transgender.73 Transgenderpeople also faced similar discrimination in regard to housing. The studyreported that 19% of respondents had been denied housing, 11% hadbeen evicted, and 19% had been homeless at some point, all directlybecause they were transgender.74 The rationale behind this discrimina-tion is simple: many people — notably evangelical Christians — believethat transgender people are immoral and therefore do not deserve pro-tected rights.75These striking numbers show a population who struggles signifi-cantly with issues most people are unaware of: being discriminated67 Id. at 614.68 Id.69 See Non-Discrimination Laws: State by State Information – Map, AM.

Because federal law andseveral states fail to protect LGBTQ people from these outcomes, alter-native legal strategies must be examined.C. BACKGROUND OF FEDERAL LAWS PROTECTING HEALTH DATAPRIVACYPersonal health data collection began in the 1920s and was tradition-ally kept on paper.76 In the 1960s, universities began to create computersystems for healthcare providers, but it wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990sthat widespread use of electronic healthcare records took hold.77 As com-puter technology advanced, so did the risks involved with storing sensi-tive data on computers.78 Congress passed a series of laws beginning in1996 that protect the privacy of personal health data; some of these lawsare discussed herein.1. HIPAAThe Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA) was landmark legislation that sought to address rapidly evolv-ing technology in the field of health information storage and collection.79The purpose of this section is to explain important terms and definitionsof HIPAA as well as describe in some detail the many complex require-ments that HIPAA has imposed on healthcare providers, namely thepromulgated regulations known as the “Privacy Rule,” the “SecurityRule,” and the “Enforcement Rule.” These three rules constitute the ma-jority of provisions that apply directly to healthcare providers, and arethe focus of HIPAA compliance.HIPAA defines “individually identifiable health information” as anyinformation created or received by any healthcare provider that relates toa health condition and identifies an individual by name or through infer-ence.80 Some of this information is called “protected health information”(hereafter, PHI).8176 Ashley Brooks, Health Information Management History: Past, Present & Future, RAS-MUSSEN COLL.

Until February 18, 2009, the maximum fine was $100 perviolation up to a maximum of $25,000 per calendar year.92 However,between 2006 and 2009, when the Privacy Rule and the EnforcementRule came into effect, zero civil fines were imposed and only two caseswere criminally prosecuted.93Since 2009, when the Health Information Technology for Economicand Clinical Health Act (HITECH) passed, the minimum fine is $100 perviolation in no-fault cases, and in cases of willful neglect is $50,000 perviolation, up to a maximum of $1,500,000 per violator per calendar82 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-2(d)(2) (2015).83 See 45 C.F.R. § 164.502(b)–(j) (2016) (explaining a limited number of circumstances inwhich PHI may be disclosed, including to parents of minors, its own business associates, and repre-sentatives of a deceased person’s estate).84 See id. at § 164.524(a)(1) (2016).85 See id. at § 164.502(a) (2016).86 Id. at § 164.306(a)(1) (2016).87 See id. at § 164.310 (2016).88 See id. at § 164.308 (2016).89 See id. at § 164.312 (2016).90 Id. at § 160.402(a) (2016).91 HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Enforcement, 71 Fed.

Although enforcement may currently be subpar, Congress hassupplemented the rules with additional legislation.2. HITECHIn addition to raising the maximum civil and criminal penalties forviolations of HIPAA privacy protections, the Health Information Tech-nology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) added newprotections for electronic health records and mandated data breach re-porting.98 The mandated data breach reporting was a major step forwardin enforcing the HIPAA rules.To protect patients, HITECH implemented detailed notice require-ments. For example, notice must be given to all affected individuals inwriting. Substitute forms of notice must be given if the contact informa-tion is out of date.99 Entities that must provide notice include: health careproviders, such as doctors and pharmacies; health plans, such as insur-ance companies and HMOs; and healthcare clearinghouses, such as dataanalysis companies.100 If more than 500 patients are affected by a single94 45 C.F.R. § 160.404(b)(2) (2016).95 U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Enforcement Results by Year — Compliance Re-views, HHS.GOV: HEALTH INFORMATION PRIVACY, http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/com-pliance-enforcement/data/results-by-year-compliance-reviews/index.html (last visited Feb. 7, 2017).96 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-6(b) (2015); see also 45 C.F.R. § 160.418 (2016).97 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-6(b) (2015).98 Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, HIPAA/HITECH Enforcement Action Alert, NAT’L LAWREVIEW (Mar. 22, 2012), http://www.natlawreview.com/article/hipaahitech-enforcement-action-alert; see generally Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program,75 Fed.

While this trend is a positive omenthat protections are moving in the right direction, it remains insufficientto fully protect all patients.3. Affordable Care ActThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), PresidentObama’s largest piece of landmark legislation, is best known for creatinghealth insurance marketplaces in most states and providing health insur-ance to millions of previously uninsured people. The most relevant partsof the ACA in regard to privacy concerns of LGBTQ people are its pro-visions for mandated compliance with electronic transaction standardsand collection of personal health data to better treat at-risk populations.The ACA requires health plans, defined as all health providers pro-viding healthcare to 50 or more people, including Medicare and Medi-caid,105 to obtain certification that it is in compliance with electronictransaction standards covering claims, electronic fund transfers, andhealthcare payments.106 A nationwide nonprofit, the Council for Afford-able Quality Healthcare (“CAQH”), developed a set of operating rulescalled CORE that is designated by the HHS Secretary as the standard forVACY, http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/index.html (last visited Feb. 7,2017).101 45 C.F.R. § 164.406(a) (2016).102 Id. at § 164.408 (2016).103 Michael L.

Thelaw itself only provides measures for collecting health disparity data onrace, ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability status.110 SinceCongress passed the law, however, HHS developed policies to collectdata on sexual orientation and gender identity, categories determined bythe HHS Secretary to be appropriate for collection.111 The wealth of per-sonal information contained in this data exponentially increases the riskfor data hacking specifically aimed at groups who are traditional targetsof hatred.The current scheme of health data protection laws, the lack of anti-discrimination laws at the federal and state levels, and the LGBTQ popu-lation’s vulnerability to discrimination leave a huge hole in the effort toprevent negative outcomes. It is beneficial to collect this data, but pro-tecting LGBTQ people’s personal information from disclosure is of theutmost importance. The fundamental thing is to create specific protec-tions for LGBTQ people to prevent them from needing to be hidden,ashamed, or secretive.D. RATIONALE FOR COLLECTING HEALTH DATA FROM LGBTQINDIVIDUALSThe medical establishment consistently seeks to improve its patienttreatment modalities, and after discovering disparities in the care ofLGBTQ people compared to other populations, it began studying healthtrends that affect the LGBTQ population.112 Researchers discoveredpowerful data indicating that LGBTQ healthcare disparities exist not be-cause of any genetic or inherent difference, but because of bias, stigma,and discrimination.113 Health problems especially faced by LGBTQ peo-107 CORE Certification, COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE, http://www.caqh.org/core/core-certification (last visited Feb. 6, 2017).108 42 U.S.C. § 1320d-2(h)(1)(B) (2015).109 COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE, supra note 107.110 42 U.S.C. § 1396w-5(a) (2015).111 Id. at § 300kk(a)(1)(D) (2013); Improving Data Collection for the LGBT Community, OF-FICE OF MINORITY HEALTH, http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=3&lvlid=57 (lastupdated Sept. 9, 2013).112 JOE ALPER, MONICA N.

Healthy People 2020, which was released in December 2010,included “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health” as a ten-yearhealth objective for the first time.117 A supplement to Healthy People2010, released in 2000, focused only on the ways other objectives includ-ing mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS would improveLGBTQ health.118 An academic journal also focused on the imminentneed for SOGI data collection to better monitor the aforementioned areasof LGBTQ health.119Health providers have already begun to implement these data collec-tion programs and have been seeing results. The federal government dur-ing the Obama administration developed a plan to integrate SOGI datainto its surveys of national health.120 Many prominent health clinics andproviders, including The Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, FenwayHealth, and Vanderbilt University, already collect SOGI data.121114 See Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health, HEALTHYPEOPLE.GOV (last visitedFeb. 7, 2017), http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-health.115 ALPER, ET AL., supra note 112, at 6.116 HEALTHYPEOPLE.GOV, supra note 114.117 2020 Topics and Objectives – Objectives A-Z, HEALTHYPEOPLE.GOV, http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives (last visited Feb. 7, 2017).118 Randall L.

However, even if all thesegoals were accomplished, the danger of health data breaches leaking per-sonally identifiable SOGI data presents a dire problem that must be rem-edied, as presented below.II. ARGUMENTA. HEALTH DATA BREACHES WILL INEVITABLY CAUSEIMPERMISSIBLE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBTQ PEOPLEThe federal government continually refuses to pass meaningfulLGBTQ anti-discrimination legislation and states vary drastically in theirprotections or burdens. LGBTQ people experience discrimination in un-acceptable amounts and with deplorable consequences, such as severebullying leading to suicide.124 With the advent of all-electronic healthdata storage and an unprecedented level of computer hacking, LGBTQpeople are at a higher risk than ever of losing their data to unknown,malicious parties.All of these factors together create an impasse when combined withnew policies to collect data that include an individual’s sexual orientationand gender identity. Connecting this new type of data collection with therisk of the data being breached will lead to further discrimination. Thereare a number of possible solutions to this problem, but the problem mustfirst be recognized and presented for consideration.122 THE FENWAY INSTITUTE & THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS, ASKING PATIENTSQUESTIONS ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY IN CLINICAL SETTINGS: A STUDY INFOUR HEALTH CENTERS 2 (2013), http://www.thefenwayinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/COM228_SOGI_CHARN_WhitePaper.pdf.123 Id. at 5.124 Ed Pilkington, Tyler Clementi, Student Outed as Gay on Internet, Jumps to His Death,THE GUARDIAN (Sept. 30, 2010, 4:08 PM), https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/30/tyler-clementi-gay-student-suicide.19Lemberg: Hackers Made Me Lose My Job!Published by GGU Law Digital Commons, 2017194 GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 471. Health Data BreachesHackers and data miners pursue sensitive and valuable information.In a culture that either actively or passively permits discriminationagainst LGBTQ people in 33 out of 50 states, people who wished toexclude those groups could potentially use data that states a person’ssexual orientation or gender identity.The sheer number of data breaches paints a grave picture. Databreaches have become so commonplace that only major breaches evenget media attention. A corporate data breach costs the company on aver-age $3.79 million.125 A full 65% of American corporations surveyed ex-perienced some type of data breach in 2014.126The incentive for hackers to obtain medical information is high: re-member that a Medicare number with other personally identifiable infor-mation can sell on the black market for almost $500,127 as opposed to astolen credit card, which nets merely $12.128 Even in less sophisticatedcriminal groups, medical information can sell for at least ten times asmuch as a credit card number.129 Medical information is also valuablebecause of its other potential uses: identity theft, false insurance claims,and blackmail.130Health data breaches are also the most costly to affected entities.The per capita cost of a health data breach is $363 per person — overdouble that of a retail data breach.131 Additionally, health care companiesexperienced a 72% increase in cyber-attacks from 2013 to 2014.132Health data breaches result in numerous consequences for affectedindividuals. In addition to losing trust in healthcare providers, affectedindividuals have reported misdiagnoses of illnesses, delays in receivingmedical treatment, mistreatment of illness, and wrong pharmaceuticalsbeing prescribed.133 A great number, 65%, of affected individuals alsosuffered financial consequences due to lost time and productivity, lower125 PONEMON INSTITUTE, 2015 COST OF DATA BREACH STUDY: GLOBAL ANALYSIS 1 (2015),https://nhlearningsolutions.com/Portals/0/Documents/2015-Cost-of-Data-Breach-Study.pdf.126 CYBER EDGE GROUP, 2015 CYBERTHREAT DEFENSE REPORT: NORTH AMERICA & EUROPE8 (2015), http://www.novell.com/docrep/2015/03/CyberEdge_2015_CDR_Report.pdf.127 Aarti Shahani, The Black Market for Stolen Health Care Data, NPR: ALL TECH CONSID-ERED (Feb. 13, 2015), http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/02/13/385901377/the-black-market-for-stolen-health-care-data.128 Skowronski, supra note 4.129 Abelson & Goldstein, supra note 5.130 Id.131 PONEMON INSTITUTE: COST OF DATA BREACH STUDY, supra note 125, at 9.132 Shahani, supra note 127.133 PONEMON INSTITUTE, 2013 SURVEY ON MEDICAL IDENTITY THEFT 8 (2013), http://www.ponemon.org/local/upload/file/2013%20Medical%20Identity%20Theft%20Report%20FINAL%2011.pdf.20Golden Gate University Law Review, Vol. 47, Iss. 2 [2017], Art. 10http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/ggulrev/vol47/iss2/102017] Hackers Made Me Lose My Job! 195credit score, legal fees, fraudulent bills, and employment-related difficul-ties such as discipline or lost wages due to time taken off from work inorder to address these issues.134 For LGBTQ people, who already experi-ence workplace discrimination and healthcare disparities, the effect of abreach could be even more severe.The consequences of health identity theft can also be aggravated bythe length of time before the patient discovers the breach. Only 9% ofpatients discover theft because of legally mandated breach notifica-tions.135 More common methods of theft discovery include errors inmedical invoices, collection letters for services not rendered, mistakes inhealth records, and adverse entries on credit reports.136 These methodsoften take substantial amounts of time before the patient discovers thetheft, which allows data thieves more time to illegally use theinformation.2.

Inthe case of attacking LGBTQ people, however, the consequences couldbe much graver.The time for legislative reform to increase protection and compli-ance is now, given HHS’s new data collection policies to improve thehealthcare of LGBTQ individuals. These policies are excellent for propo-nents of specialized healthcare and the LGBTQ population at large, butthey may add significantly to LGBTQ people’s potential harm whencombined with increasing numbers of data breaches.A published list of names with other personally identifiable informa-tion of LGBTQ people could be catastrophic. Employers in states that donot provide anti-discrimination protections could maintain do-not-hirelists, or fire all their LGBTQ employees without notice. State agenciesand private landlords could automatically deny people from renting orbuying a home.

Health data privacy is already an im-portant priority for the federal government, considering the threelandmark pieces of legislation made into law in the last twenty years —HIPAA, HITECH, and the ACA. Currently, LGBTQ people who chooseto seek remedies for health data breaches face a dire decision. If anLGBTQ individual chooses to file a lawsuit alleging a violation of theirprivacy right, they run the risk of making their sexual orientation or gen-der identity public through court records. If they decide not to file inorder to protect their privacy, they suffer in silence. The current optionsare insufficient and do not protect LGBTQ people. However, there are anumber of possible remedies that the government and private companiescan implement in order to lessen these risks.B. SUGGESTED REMEDIES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AGAINSTLGBTQ PEOPLEIn the absence of meaningful legislation that protects LGBTQ peo-ple, there are other methods to protect them. In the realm of computerhacking of health data, a comprehensive solution requires resources, dili-gence, and effort. However, the benefits of compliance include not onlystronger protections for LGBTQ people, but also lower risks of databreaches and huge long-term company cost savings. It is a win-win situa-tion for the LGBTQ population, companies, and the general public.1. Compliancea. Security InfrastructureIn the movies, computer systems frequently become sentient andmalicious;144 in real life, only humans are capable of breaching computerinformation. Because people cause data breaches, people are the onlyway to stop the release of data. The standards presented in HIPAA andrelated legislation would be sufficient to protect patient health data if it144 See 2001: A Space Odyssey (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 1968); The Terminator (Orion Pic-tures 1984); WarGames (MGM/UA Entm’t Co. 1983).23Lemberg: Hackers Made Me Lose My Job!Published by GGU Law Digital Commons, 2017198 GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW [Vol. 47were followed to the letter. However, high costs, a shortage in competentinformation technology employees, and lack of incentive make compli-ance difficult.145High cost is a top reason for security noncompliance. Regulatorycompliance is undoubtedly a business decision — the benefits must out-weigh the costs. The average cost for achieving regulatory compliance is$3.5 million per company.146 This is close to the reported cost for anaverage data breach, $3.79 million per incident.147 However, upon closerinspection, when additional costs related to the breach are included like“business disruption, reduced productivity, fees, penalties and other legaland non-legal settlement costs,” the overall price raises to $9.4 millionper incident.148 This stark difference would seem to suggest that there isno reason for companies not to comply, but the number of data breachesstill occurring paints a different picture.Lack of enforcement also plays into companies’ decisions not tocomply with the law. Even repeat blatant offenders of HIPAA privacylaws are often not scrutinized and penalized — the HHS Office of CivilRights warned CVS Pharmacy over two hundred times between 2011and 2014 to stop violating laws, but throughout HIPAA’s lifetime, HHSfined CVS only once for $2.25 million.149Even when companies achieve full regulatory compliance, patientdata may still be at risk for breach. Data encryption is the industry stan-dard in the technology sector, and protects everything from copyrightedinformation to credit card processing to website user data.150 However,HIPAA does not mandate data encryption, so companies that are in fullregulatory compliance may still have major security holes.145 Stephanie Tayengco, Why Are Healthcare Data Breaches So Common?, BECKER’SHEALTH IT & CIO REVIEW (Sept. 17, 2015), http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/why-are-healthcare-data-breaches-so-common.html.146 Ellen Messmer, Cost of Regulatory Security Compliance?

Many companies, tosave costs and keep knowledge internal, choose to keep security-relatedtasks in-house rather than hiring outside companies, but often do nothave the resources to train their employees with rapidly changingstandards.155Cloud services — data systems and networks that exist entirely onthe internet — are relatively new, but the top providers such as AmazonWeb Services (“AWS”), Rackspace, Microsoft Azure, and Google CloudComputing provide greatly enhanced protection for data.156 Storing datain the cloud entrusts cloud providers with many traditional securityproblems, such as unauthorized access to server rooms, audit controls,and user access controls. To combat these problems, Amazon Web Ser-vices advertises and explains how to use their tools to comply withHIPAA requirements.157 Amazon Web Services increases their clients’data security because “the odds of someone breaching AWS and gettingaccess to your [data] [are] likely zero.”158The demand for competent IT departments outstrips the supply,which is another cause of data breaches.

Incentives for ComplianceHIPAA has been in effect for nearly twenty years, and its Enforce-ment Rule for ten years, but compliance is still fairly uncommon. En-couragement of compliance can come in two forms: incentives andpenalties.Congress passed some significant financial incentives as part of vari-ous laws to encourage compliance with HIPAA. As previously men-tioned, HITECH included a $25.9 billion appropriation of funds toencourage healthcare providers to adopt electronic health records. Thetrack record of healthcare providers in actually protecting sensitive pa-tient health data is poor and the government’s stake in protecting its con-stituents is too high to quarrel over budgetary line items.Congress’s effort to encourage use of electronic health records wassuccessful, but they have inadequately addressed the protection of thoserecords. Congress needs to take the next logical step: providing fundsand resources to enforce the laws and protecting their constituents. Cur-rently, smaller health providers often do not have the resources to com-ply fully with regulations, and larger companies are attractive targets forhackers because of the breadth of information available in one place.Therefore, the congressional budget should include new funds for health-care companies and providers to comply with HIPAA privacy and secur-ity safeguards, supplemented by the newly raised penalties as describedbelow.Congress should also authorize additional penalties on noncompliantcompanies. Raising the cap of $1.5 million per incident may seem draco-nian, but it may not be enough to strong-arm large companies into fullcompliance. Anthem Blue Cross, which suffered a breach in January2015 that affected as many as 80 million people,161 has an annual profit159 Id.160 Id.161 Michael Hiltzik, Anthem Is Warning Consumers About Its Huge Data Breach.

Thus, the cap on penal-ties under HIPAA should be drastically increased on a sliding scale. Thisaction would serve as a warning to noncompliant providers, and effectthe same result as punitive damages would if a private right in tortexisted.2. Enforcementa. New Right in Tort Under HIPAAWhile HHS has the ability to levy civil fines and prosecute criminalsunder HIPAA, there is still a giant hole in remedies available to victimsof data breaches. Specifically, Congress did not create a private right intort under HIPAA.163 Because a suit for HIPAA-noncompliance resultingin damages would address a failure to protect data instead of LGBTQdiscrimination, it does not run the same risks of outing an LGBTQ indi-vidual as a suit regarding direct discrimination.Plaintiffs have brought a few successful cases against healthce com-panies for violations of privacy. In 2006, plaintiff Heather Acosta suedher doctor for improperly accessing her medical records.164 She sued inNorth Carolina state court on a theory of negligent infliction of emo-tional distress and invasion of privacy and the court dismissed her casefor failure to state a claim.165 On appeal, the court reversed Acosta’sdismissal.166 The North Carolina appellate court recognized that HIPAAset a duty of care that was breached by the doctor even though HIPAAdid not afford a cause of action itself.167 This case is one of the fewexamples of any plaintiff successfully recovering damages for an inva-sion of privacy.One state, Connecticut, decided that HIPAA does not preempt stateclaims for damages.168 However, there is no sign that this decision has162 ANTHEM, 2014 ANNUAL REPORT: REDEFINING REINVENTING REASSURING 12 (2014), http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/13/130104/2014AR/export7/pdfs/Anthem_2014AR.pdf.163 Edward Vishnevetsky, Can A HIPAA Violation Give Rise to a Private Cause of Action?,DALLAS/FORT WORTH HEALTHCARE DAILY (May 27, 2014), http://healthcare.dmagazine.com/2014/05/27/can-a-hipaa-violation-give-rise-to-a-private-cause-of-action/.164 Acosta v.

Because these HIPAA tort claims would likelybe numerous and similar to one another, Congress should assign the taskof adjudicating these matters to administrative courts, which currentlyhandle federal matters such as social security disability applications andMedicare appeals. The specter of countless tort claims in the aftermath ofa data breach would not only protect the interests of consumers effec-tively, but would be enough of an incentive to ensure full protection inthe future by that company and all others.b. Increased Budget for HHS Office of Civil RightsThe HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for allHIPAA-related investigations. This includes all levying of civil penalties,audits, policy writing, and business administration.169 The OCR does thison a total budgetary allocation of $42,705,000, which increased less than$4 million from the previous year.170 This number, while seemingly sig-nificant, is actually insufficient considering the ever-increasing numberof data breaches to enforce. Enforcement of the current laws is the bestway to encourage healthcare companies to protect their patients’ PHI.As the agency responsible for protecting individually identifiablehealth information, it is imperative that this office be funded to the great-est reasonable extent. Much of this increased budget may be able tocome from the increased revenue gained by additional enforcement.Their ability to investigate and audit healthcare companies under theHIPAA Enforcement Rule is the only thing that gives HIPAA any clout.This is, of course, dependent on Congress increasing a budgetary allot-ment, but it is not a major expense in the grand scale of a congressionalbudget.The HHS OCR enforces HIPAA violations and receives settlements.In 2014, the OCR collected a total of $7,940,220 from six healthcarecompanies with major HIPAA violations and then set up complianceplans with them.171 This type of collection will increase HHS’s budget as169 JOCELYN SAMUELS, OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS FISCAL YEAR 2016 CONGRESSIONAL JUSTIFI-CATION 20 (Office of Civil Rights ed., 2015), http://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/budget/office-of-civil-rights-budget-justification-2016.pdf.170 Id. at 6.171 Id. at 22-23.28Golden Gate University Law Review, Vol. 47, Iss. 2 [2017], Art. 10http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/ggulrev/vol47/iss2/102017] Hackers Made Me Lose My Job! 203well, but the scale of the operations must increase further to achieve fullenforcement.III. CONCLUSIONThe Hzone and Ashley Madison breaches showed how monetarygain was not always the objective for data hackers and the lengths somewere willing to go to expose people they view as hypocritical or morallywrong. Unfortunately, many people in the United States still see gay andbisexual people, lesbians, and transgender people as moral failures, andthey are therefore at risk of having their identities exposed by hackers.Data breaches are of major concern to businesses in all sectors, butthe stakes are highest in the healthcare sector. Electronic health recordscontain highly personal and sensitive information, and the publication ofthis information can be catastrophic to individuals — not to mention badfor business.In theory, the legal protections offered to victims of data breachesare sufficient to protect their privacy rights, but in practice the protec-tions fall short. The enforcement capabilities of the HHS Office of CivilRights are limited by budgetary restrictions, Department of Justice offi-cials are overworked, and affected individuals have no ability to protecttheir own interests past receiving free credit monitoring software.The inherently sensitive nature of health data increases the impor-tance of its protection. The potential of medical identity theft is invasiveand harmful enough, but the leak of information attached to one’s namethat makes that person susceptible to discriminatory consequences issimply unacceptable. Losing a job or being denied service solely becauseof one’s sexual orientation or gender identity is offensive in any circum-stance, but it is unfathomably odious if that were to occur because ahealthcare provider had insufficient security protections on their servers.Until substantive anti-discrimination protections are offered to allLGBTQ people in the United States, gaps in this population’s constitu-tional rights must be protected by all legally available means. A greatlapse in justice is avoidable, but only if changes are made quickly.The potential connection between LGBTQ discrimination and healthdata breaches exists. The solutions presented here are preliminary sug-gestions; significantly more study should occur on this topic. Animus-driven data breaches have only just begun; Hzone and Ashley Madisonwere early warning shots. The costs are worth it, and LGBTQ peoplealong with the rest of the United States deserve better protection of theirpersonal data.29Lemberg: Hackers Made Me Lose My Job!Published by GGU Law Digital Commons, 2017",
