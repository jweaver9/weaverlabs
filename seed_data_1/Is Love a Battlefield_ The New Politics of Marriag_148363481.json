Introduction: 2016 \nThe election of Donald J. Trump to the presidency of the United States marks a \nkey shift in the state of national politics. For rightwing enthusiasts, his election represents \na triumph over rampant political correctness and the elitist political establishment of \nWashington, DC. For leftwing opponents, it signifies the disturbing normalization of a \nfascist discourse at the highest level of mainstream politics. In the aftermath of perhaps \none of the most contentious elections in US history, those on the left side of the aisle find \nthemselves counting their losses and evaluating the stakes of their defeat, desperately \nsifting through the slew of pledges amassed during Trump’s lengthy seventeen-month \ncampaign. Some of the centerpieces of Trump’s campaign to “Make America Great \nAgain” that launched the president-elect into political stardom among persuaded \nAmericans included the deportation of eleven million undocumented immigrants to \nMexico, the construction of a wall spanning the entire length of the US-Mexico border, \nthe temporary ban of Muslims from entering the country, and the federal defunding of \nPlanned Parenthood. Conversely, his polarizing platform touched a nerve among \nminorities across the spectrum and their political supporters, serving to rally those \ndisenchanted voters against his divisive message.  \nAs a Republican presidential candidate, Trump made a historical appeal to the \nLGBTQ electorate. Despite his concerted efforts to court the LGBTQ vote, data collected \nfrom exit polls reveals that LGBTQ voters were the only major demographic whose \nopposition to the Republican candidate in 2016 has actually increased since the re-\n 3 \nelection of Barack Obama in 2012.1 To be fair, it is no surprise that proponents of \nLGBTQ rights failed to turn out in droves in favor of a Trump presidency. They protested \nhis vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence—the Indiana governor notorious for opposing \nsame-sex marriage, advancing “religious liberty” legislation that would sanction \ndiscrimination against LGBTQ folks, and promoting conversion therapy for LGBTQ \nminors throughout his state. Furthermore, there was deep worry over the possibility of \nTrump appointing Supreme Court justices who would attempt to gut same-sex marriage. \nWithout delegitimizing the threat that these factors pose to mainstream LGBTQ politics, I \nfocus my attention on the more unusual “pro-LGBTQ” efforts that defined key moments \nof Trump’s campaign.  \nJust days before the election in November, Trump was seen parading a rainbow \nflag on stage at a Colorado campaign rally. However, it was in July 2016 during the \nRepublican National Convention that Trump’s apparently “pro-gay” position became \ndefinitively grounded in his campaign platform. Peter Thiel—billionaire tech investor, \nfounder of PayPal, and openly gay man—spoke out in support of Trump, proclaiming, “I \nam proud to be gay. I am proud of be a Republican. But most of all I am proud to be an \nAmerican,” signaling the first time an openly gay person has taken the stage at the \nConvention.2 When Trump himself came around to the podium on the final night of the \nConvention, he made a startling appeal to the LGBTQ community. Highlighting the \n“Islamic terrorist” attack at Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016, Trump stated, \n“As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect LGBTQ citizens from the \n                                                        \n1 \"LGBT Voters Came out Strong for Hillary, Dumped Trump in Historic \nNumbers.\" AMERICAblog News.

Web. \n 4 \nviolence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.”3 As a lesbian viewing the \nbroadcast in real time, I was speechless; not only was his message a stark departure from \nthe explicitly anti-gay platform that the Republican Party has embraced for years,4 but it \nalso signaled Trump’s attempt to pit LGBTQ folks against Muslims (falsely assuming the \nmutual exclusivity of the two groups). To top it all off, the Republican-packed arena \nfrantically cheered and chanted “USA” in response to Trump’s promise to protect \nLGBTQ citizens from Islamic terrorism, to which Trump himself expressed \nastonishment.5 These bizarre moments in present-day American politics have left me \ndesperately searching for answers: what ideological objective is served by Trump’s \npromotion of the LGBTQ community as a class of citizens, worthy of protection from \nIslamic terrorism? What events in recent history might explain this significant shift in \nRepublican campaign strategy towards a favorable (if only rhetorically) treatment of the \nLGBTQ community?  \nThe answer, as I will argue throughout this paper, has much to do with same-sex \nmarriage and the US nation-building project. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court \npublicly announced its landmark decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 6 effectively legalizing \nsame-sex marriage throughout the US. Aside from offering state-sanctioned marriage and \n                                                        \n3 Donald J.

Print.  \n 5 \nits material benefits7 to same-sex couples across the nation for the first time, the ruling \ncreated new inroads for certain groups of queer folks8 in accessing full-fledged \ncitizenship and partaking in the nation-building project. Utilizing the mass shooting at \nPulse nightclub and its aftermath as temporal indicators of shifting political attitudes \naround LGBTQ rights, I argue that since Obergefell, the respectability9 newly available \nto queer folks (specifically those who participate or aspire to participate in traditional \nmarriage and family-building) is responsible for creating a new class of “good queers” \nworthy of protection from “bad Muslims.” In other words, beyond enabling certain queer \nfolks to reap the legal and social benefits afforded to “good citizens,” the legalization of \nsame-sex marriage has also assisted in reifying a new strategic incentive for the \ncontinuation of the War on Terror: that is the state’s investment in protecting its good \n                                                        \n7 The material benefits and responsibilities afforded to married couples by the government \ninclude “taxation; inheritance and property rights, rules of intestate succession; spousal privilege \nin the law of evidence; hospital access; medical decision making authority; adoption rights; the \nrights and benefits of survivors; birth and death certificates; professional and ethics rules, \ncampaign finance restrictions; workers’ compensation benefits; health insurance; and child \ncustody, support and visitation rules.” Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2601 (2015).  \n8 The term “queer” has been the subject of extensive debate both within and outside lesbian, gay \nbisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) communities and their respective discourses. I do not \nsimply reject the critical negotiations over this term that such scholars like Cathy J. Cohen have \nengaged in, including her extension of the term “queer” to apply to certain racialized heterosexual \nindividuals; rather, in acknowledgment of the rhetorical limitations within the discourse of \nsexuality, I assert my usage of “queer” throughout this paper as a means of capturing all folks \nwhose sexualities reside outside of conventional understandings of heterosexual conduct (that is \nsex between two cisgender individuals of the opposite sex), as opposed to the commonly \ndeployed lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) classification, which inherently excludes two larger \ngroups: 1) those individuals who engage in non-heterosexual sex who reject assigning themselves \nto the above-mentioned LGB categories, and 2) trans individuals who engage in heterosexual sex \nbut whose trans identity may forbid the state’s recognition of it as such.  \n9 Throughout this paper I utilize the term “respectability” to describe the state’s attitude towards \nqueer folks whose aspirations and life choices adhere to its idea of proper citizenship \n 6 \nqueers from “Islamic terrorism” and, more specifically, those bad Muslims who aspire to \nkill them.10    \nThroughout this paper, I will grapple with the major debates that have dominated \nthe discourse around same-sex marriage—utilizing the conservative view offered in \nLawrence v. Texas,11 the liberal view in Obergefell, and foundational leftist anti-marriage \ntheories as the primary objects of my analysis—and give weight to the ways in which the \nstate’s administration of social and legal rewards (as made available through the \ninstitution of marriage) has necessarily been shaped by its preferences for whiteness and \nthe traditional nuclear family. Taking into account the arguments that ultimately \nsucceeded in achieving marriage equality, I will go on to situate these winning logics in \nthe framework of US counterterror strategies and expose how the state’s production of \ngood queers worthy of protection is currently being deployed for the purposes of \nbolstering support for the War on Terror,12 as evidenced by Donald Trump’s comments at \nthe Republican National Convention. Ultimately, I aim to highlight the mechanisms by \nwhich the state’s construction of good queers helps legitimize the hyper-surveillance and \nsustained targeting of Muslims as a disposable class of “terrorists” in the name of \nnational security.  \n \nII. The Path to Protection: A Queer’s Journey into the Heart of the \nNation-State \n \n                                                        \n10 Later in this paper I will discuss other ways in which the construction of the “good queer” has \nserved to marginalize other groups—in addition to Muslims—not traditionally defined by their \nsexuality, such as low-income women of color. \n11 Lawrence v. Texas. United States Supreme Court. 26 June 2003. Print.  \n12 Although Trump characterizes the war as against “Radical Islamic Terrorism” instead of as the \n“War on Terror” (originally coined by President George W. Bush on September 20, 2001), I \nutilize the latter term to emphasize the continuity of the war initiated in 2001 and its targets. \n 7 \nAlthough the battle over marriage equality has been a dominant fixture of political \ndiscourse in recent years, it was not until the early 1990s that the same-sex marriage \nagenda materialized as a bona fide political campaign. Scholars posit that some members \nof the LGBTQ community pursued marriage equality with new fervor as a response to \nthe AIDS crisis, during which challenges to hospital visitation, surrogate medical \ndecision-making, and property inheritance exposed the stark injustices many experienced \ndue to their unmarried status.13 Others suggest that the intensified push for marriage \nequality paralleled organized efforts to combat additional problems emerging against the \nLGBTQ community, such as President Clinton’s authorization of “Don’t Ask, Don’t \nTell” (1992) and the “Defense of Marriage Act” (1993)14—both of which codified the \nillegality of homosexuality in unprecedented ways.15 While some queer folks were for the \nfirst time organizing the fight for same-sex marriage, the legality of queer sexuality was \nstill unsettled and pending review by the Supreme Court. It was only in 2003 that the \nSupreme Court overturned Bowers v. Hardwick (1986)16 and ruled in favor of petitioners \nin Lawrence v. Texas (2003), declaring Texas’ anti-sodomy laws unconstitutional and \neffectively legalizing the practice of “private” homosexual sex across the nation. Indeed, \nthe logics produced by the courts during this period of sodomy decriminalization have \n                                                        \n13 Klarman, Michael J. \"How Same-sex Marriage Came to Be.\" Harvard Law Today. N.p., n.d. \nWeb. \n14 Although Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT)—recognizing the inclusion of LGB people in the \nmilitary—and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)—defining marriage as between a man and a \nwoman—differed in their fundamental treatment of queer folks (DADT being understood as an \nextension of rights and DOMA as a restriction), both pieces of legislation made queerness \nexplicitly a legal subject in unprecedented ways in the US.   \n15 Warner, Michael. The Trouble with Normal: Sex, Politics, and the Ethics of Queer Life. \nCambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2003. Print. \n16 In Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), the Supreme Court held that states were within their rights to \nimpose bans on sodomy.  \n \n  \n 8 \ncontributed substantially to the contents of the debates over same-sex marriage, as \nevidenced by the justices’ written opinions and their explicit references to Bowers and \nLawrence in defending their respective points. As such, it cannot be dismissed that the \nrationales supporting the decriminalization of sodomy in 2003 have necessarily informed \nthe Court’s authorization of same-sex marriage in 2015. \n \nA. The Conservative Slant \nThe arguments that constitute Justice Antonin Scalia’s dissent in Lawrence \nexpose the logics that have driven mainstream conservative political discourse and its \nunapologetic promotion of legal regulation of deviant sexualities. In admonishing the \nCourt for overturning Bowers, which legitimized a state’s ability to criminalize sodomy, \nScalia writes, “State laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, \nmasturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity are likewise sustainable only \nin light of Bowers’ validation of laws based on moral choices.”17 Scalia and like-minded \nconservative-thinkers subscribe to the notion that the legitimacy of the state’s regulation \nof sexuality is located in its ability to distinguish between what is moral and what is \nimmoral. However, by situating his support for the state’s regulation of sodomy among a \nslew of other non-normative sexual behaviors deemed collectively “immoral,” Scalia not \nonly reaffirms these behaviors’ shared immorality relative to heteronormative18 principles \nbut also makes available a more fundamental critique of the state’s regulation of sexuality \nas it functions in relation to moral judgments—that the state dangerously overextends \n                                                        \n17 Lawrence v. Texas. United States Supreme Court. 26 June 2003. Print. \n18 I use “heteronormative” to describe the process by which authoritative heterosexual notions of \nproper interpersonal and sexual conduct are standardized and embedded in mainstream social \ndiscourse.  \n 9 \nitself into the intimate lives of private individuals when it attempts to referee proper \nsexuality in the first place. His dissent thus accurately predicts some of the chief logics \nthat would drive the Court’s eventual adjudication of same-sex marriage and \nsimultaneously exposes the state’s long-standing practice of regulating sexuality \naccording to normative moral judgments.  \n \nB. The Liberal Slant \nInterestingly the language of morality is entirely abandoned among the \nconservative justices’ dissenting opinions in Obergefell. Whereas the substance of their \ndissents focuses on the alleged overreach of the courts in creating policy in lieu of \nconventional democratic procedures, it is the liberal branch of the Court that embraces \nthe language of morality and dignity (as made available by conservative dissenters in \nLawrence) in order to fashion its defense of same-sex marriage. While this language \ncertainly percolates through the entire Obergefell majority opinion, Justice Robert \nKennedy’s conclusion paragraph remains perhaps the single most widely cited segment \namong misty-eyed liberals who bask in the language of the Court’s ruling. As such, it \ndeserves its own focused evaluation. Kennedy famously writes the following: \nNo union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, \nfidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become \nsomething greater than once they were. As some of the petitions in these cases \ndemonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would \nmisunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their \nplea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for \nthemselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of \ncivilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The \nConstitution grants them that right.19 \n \n                                                        \n19 See Obergefell v. Hodges. 28. United States Supreme Court. 26 June 2015. Print. \n 10 \nThe conclusion paragraph serves as a vehicle through which the court—as an executor of \nstate power—makes normative a particular set of assumed “shared aspirations” and \ndisseminates them to the American people, queer and otherwise. Kennedy reiterates the \nsignificance of marriage as an embodiment of our “highest ideals of love, fidelity, \ndevotion, sacrifice, and family.” This family-centric position is a shared ideal among \nliberals and conservatives alike, returning to the long-held reverence for the nuclear \nfamily as a reflection of the nation-state’s most deeply held values.20 Indeed, this \ncharacterization of the family as an embodiment of American values has been \nrearticulated by Supreme Court justices countless times with respect to an array of legal \nissues extending beyond the scope of marriage and family.21 This veneration of family \nsaturates Kennedy’s defense of same-sex marriage in Obergefell, which is further \nevidenced by his adamant defense of the petitioners on the basis of their deep respect for \nthe institution of marriage. Kennedy proposes that “it would misunderstand these men \nand women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage”—a presumable response to \nrightwing opponents—and offers “that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they \nseek to find its fulfillment for themselves.” The language Kennedy deploys here is \nsignificant in that it reveals two key factors underlying the Court’s decision: the \nsuccessful defense of same-sex marriage is located in the liberal justices’ joint \n                                                        \n20 Berlant, Lauren Gail. The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and \nCitizenship. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 1997. Print. \n21 See Meyer v. Nebraska (1923), in which the Court found it pertinent to emphasize the \nimportance of family in relation to a state law prohibiting schools from teaching foreign \nlanguages to students below the eighth grade; In deeming the law unconstitutional, \nJustice McReynolds delivers the opinion of the Court, writing, “[The freedoms \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment denote] the right of the individual to contract, \nto engage in any of the common occupations of life… to marry, establish a home and \nbring up children… and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized by common \nlaw as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” Meyer v. Nebraska. \nUnited States Supreme Court. 4 June 1923. Print.  \n 11 \nappreciation for the queer petitioners’ “deep respect for marriage” as well as the justices’ \ncollective disavowal and implicit denunciation of marriage-abstainers. As such, it \nbecomes clear that the designation of marriage rights to same-sex couples is premised on \nqueer folks’ assumed respect for the institution and all it implies. Conversely, those who \npresumably “disrespect marriage” are relegated to a lesser status.  \nIn the final moments of delivering the majority opinion, Kennedy makes a \nremarkable departure from the conventional debate over the right to marriage and its \ncorresponding benefits. Situated in the haze of Constitutionalized fantasies and romantic \nreflections on civil liberties and “the pursuit of happiness,” there is a cagey shift in which \nthe Court’s rhetoric of marriage rights expands to include a new and ostensibly discrete \n“right”: the right to dignity.22 In closing his statements, Kennedy writes, “[The queer \npetitioners] ask for equal dignity under the law. The Constitution grants them that right,” \neffectively fortifying the inextricable link between marriage and dignity. Delivering \nqueer folks from a “condemned life of loneliness,” Kennedy offers the gift of marriage as \na path to the acquisition of dignity. Consequently, Kennedy’s defense of same-sex \nmarriage is intimately tied to assumptions about the dignity that marriage confers upon its \nsubjects in general, regardless of sexual orientation. As such, the resonations of this \nruling are felt across the general public indiscriminately, including (perhaps \nunexpectedly) unmarried individuals belonging to groups whose identities fall outside the \n                                                        \n22 According to Neomi Rao, the form of “dignity” that is conferred upon same-sex couples \nthrough marriage is defined by the social and political recognition that the institution \nmakes available: “dignity does not necessarily turn on tangible rights or freedoms. Strict \nequality of legal benefits are viewed as inadequate standing alone, because dignity as \nrecognition depends essentially on how one’s choices and relationships are viewed by the \nbroader social and political community, by the attitude expressed about one’s \nrelationships by the law.” Rao, Neomi. “Three Concepts of Dignity in Constitutional \nLaw.” Notre Dame Law Review 86.1 (2011): 183-271. Web. \n 12 \nconventionally understood category of queer. While purporting to further a new equality \n(the equal right to marriage for homosexual and heterosexual couples alike), Obergefell \nmay also be understood as a legal catalyst for the reinforcement of a deeply entrenched \nsocial inequality with roots well-documented in U.S. history: the inequality of unmarried \nfolks against the married.23 Although an already well-established pillar of social \nconvention, the inequality of unmarried folks in relation to their married counterparts \nbecomes reinvigorated by the Obergefell decision and its explicit assignment of dignity to \nthose who marry. As such, the results of these judicial logics are far more widespread \nthan may be immediately apparent.  \n \nC. The Injustice of Marriage \nThough framed as an extension of rights to queer folks, the Obergefell ruling is \nnothing short of a blatant message to the American people as a whole—a message that \nindeed carries with it an array of material benefits to those who comply with the Court’s \nvaluation of marriage and punitive actions against those who deviate. It is a message \nwhose origins in the US can be traced back to the inception of the nation-state itself, and \nit has been reiterated in compliance with evolving socio-political contexts, most of which \nhave necessarily involved race and debates over extending equal rights to black folks. \nDuring the “slavery era,”24 black folks were forbidden from accessing citizenship and its \nmaterial benefits—including the right to enter into contracts such as marriage—on the \n                                                        \n23 Murray, Melissa. \"Obergefell v. Hodges and Nonmarriage Inequality.\" California Law \nReview 104.5 (2016): 1207-258. Academic Search Premier. Web. 4 Nov. 2016. \n24 The notion that state-sanctioned slavery no longer exists in the US remains contestable in \nrelation to the prevalent conditions of mass-incarceration and forced labor; however, I refer here \nto the colonial period through 1865, marking the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment \neffectively abolishing chattel slavery. \n 13 \nbasis of their assumed inequality to whites.25 In the years following the passage of the \nThirteenth Amendment and the effective abolition of chattel slavery in 1865, efforts to \npreserve the integrity of marriage and white racial purity26 manifested in anti-\nmiscegenation laws prohibiting interracial marriage and sex.27 It was only during Loving \nv. Virginia (1967) that the Court overturned these anti-miscegenation laws and cemented \nmarriage as a “fundamental right” under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection \nClause. Indeed, there are striking parallels to be made in comparing the reverence for \nmarriage that was used to legitimize the prohibition of interracial marriage through the \n1960s and the present-day extension of marriage equality to same-sex couples. In his \ndefense of Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws in Loving, Assistant Attorney General R.D. \nMcIlwaine III presents miscegenation as a threat to marriage—an institution “[having] \nmore to do with a welfare and civilization of the people than any other institution.”28 He \ngoes on to characterize interracial spouses as possessing “a rebellious attitude towards \nsociety, self-hatred, neurotic tendencies, immaturity, and other detrimental psychological \nfactors,” from whom child “victims” and “martyrs” are born.29 Although serving to \nfurther ostensibly different legal goals, McIlwaine’s and Kennedy’s arguments converge \nin their adoration and ardent protection of marriage; whereas the passionate and \nsentimental defense of marriage in Obergefell is understood to have brought about \n                                                        \n25 See Dred Scott v.

All-too-absent from \nthe mainstream debate over marriage equality is the leftist position that rejects the \ninstitution altogether precisely because of the injustices it introduces and perpetuates. As \nqueer theorist Michael Warner keenly points out in his famous anti-marriage manifesto \n“Normal and Normaller: Beyond Gay Marriage,” “Squeezing gay couples into the legal \nsorting machine will only confirm the relevance of spousal status and leave unmarried \nqueers looking more deviant before a legal system that can claim broader legitimacy.”30 \nThe impenetrable layer of sentimentalism that blankets the conventional liberal sermon in \nfavor of same-sex marriage muddies the water for a more pointed interrogation of the \ninstitution of marriage as a whole (including the inherent harms it poses for unmarried \nqueer and heterosexual folks alike). Pitched as threats to the beloved institution of \nmarriage, “adulterers, prostitutes, divorcees, the promiscuous, single people, unwed \nparents, and those below the age of consent” find themselves the inadvertent adversaries \nof the crusade for marriage, according to Cathy J. Cohen. 31 Indeed, so too do \nheterosexual women of color on welfare—already deemed sexually immoral and \n                                                        \n30 See Warner, Michael. \"On Normal and Normaller: Beyond Gay Marriage.\" The Free \nPress (1999): 123-43.

Marriage and Nation-Building \nBy now, the personal benefits afforded to queer folks wielding their marriage \nrights (as well as the corresponding problems of the institution altogether) should be well \nestablished. It is important that the Obergefell decision not be interpreted merely as a sort \nof rights-allocation to a traditionally marginalized group but as a crucial element in the \nfurtherance of the United States’ enduring quest for nation-building and nationalism. \nBenedict Anderson’s theoretical conception of the nation as “an imagined community”—\nwhose collective identity and purpose are located in its fantasy of shared values and other \npoints of alleged mutual identification—stands as a salient approach for understanding \nthe state’s incentive for granting marriage rights to same-sex couples.32 In The Queen of \nAmerica Goes to Washington City, Lauren Berlant situates her analysis of present-day \nidentity politics around the notion of “citizen trauma” in order to explain the United \nStates’ investment in revamping its nation-building efforts within the twenty-first \ncentury. Identifying some of the major drivers of widespread national insecurity as of \nrecent, she writes, “The crisis of national future, stimulated by sexual politics, comes at a \ntime when America feels unsure about its value on a number of domains: in world \n                                                        \n32 See Anderson, Benedict. Imagined Communities. London: Verso, 1991. Print. \n 16 \nmilitary politics, in global economics, in ecological practice, and in the claim that the \nnation has a commitment to sustaining justice, democracy, and the American Dream \nwhen there seems to be less money and reliable work to go around.”33 In identifying \nsome of the underlying issues that continue to challenge possibilities for US nationhood, \nBerlant highlights the incentives driving the nation-state’s commitment to curing its \nsuffering sense of self.  \nOur nation’s leaders naturally emerge as some of our most sacred keepers in \nfurthering this project to repair the nation. Accordingly, the illusion of absorbing certain \nqueer folks into the nation-state presents itself as central to the Supreme Court’s \nlegalization of same-sex marriage. Kennedy’s remarks in Obergefell expose the extent to \nwhich marriage bestows queer subjects access to citizenship34 and national belonging. He \nwrites the following: \n[T]he Court’s cases and the Nation’s traditions make clear that marriage is a keystone of \nthe Nation’s social order …When the American retires from the turmoil of public life to \nthe bosom of the family, he finds in it the image of order and peace… [H]e afterwards \ncarries [that image] with him into public affairs … For that reason, just as a couple vows \nto support each other, so does society pledge to support the couple, offering symbolic \nrecognition and material benefits to protect and nourish the union.35 \n \nMost noteworthy here is Kennedy’s rumination on the symbiotic relationship between \nmarried couple and nation. His fantasy entails a social order in which spouses support \neach other, and in turn the nation offers “symbolic recognition and material benefits to \nprotect and nourish the union.” Kennedy’s articulation of the linkage of marriage to \n                                                        \n33 See Berlant, Lauren.

Riding on \nthe coattails of established US ideology that has sought to define the nation by its \ncommitments and rules to marriage, Obergefell serves as the effective culmination of a \npolitical progression in which the nation-state becomes reimagined as belonging to the \ngood queer, too. As I display in the sections to follow, the bestowment of dignity and \nsocial citizenship onto the good queer through these judicial proceedings will eventually \nlend itself to the rhetorical premises supporting Trump’s warmongering presidential \nagenda.   \n \nIII. A Queer’s Right to Marriage is the Nation’s Right to War: \nReimagining the Nation’s Role in the War on Terror \n \n“Only weeks ago in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered \nby an Islamic terrorist. This time the terrorist targeted the LGBTQ community… As your \npresident, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the \nviolence and oppression of a hateful, foreign ideology… And I have to say, as a \nRepublican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.” \n—Donald J. Trump, Republican National Convention, July 21, 201636 \n \nThe concurrent progressions of the crusade for marriage equality and the War on \nTerror are not an accident. Indeed, in peculiar ways the two campaigns have functioned \nin tandem, with each defining and driving the basis for the other. Following the attacks \non the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11, the nation found itself extensively \nreimagining who it was and the nature of the threats lodged against it.37 Accordingly, \nwhile June 26, 2015 may be understood as the culmination of the good queer’s absorption \n                                                        \n36 Donald J.

Print. \n 18 \ninto the image of the nation-state,38 we may also view September 11, 2001 as the \ncommencement of a colossal campaign to define and obliterate public enemy number \none—the bad Muslim, the terrorist.39 Donald Trump’s recent pledge to “protect our \nLGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful, foreign ideology”—\nIslam, to be explicit—signals a key turning point in the War on Terror and the socio-\npolitical conditions that sustain it. For the first time in mainstream US politics, we see \nbipartisanship around a particular kind of “queer rights”–albeit hawkish by nature and \npremised on the eradication of Muslim bodies in “defense” of certain queer ones.  \nFor the remainder of this paper, I argue that the legalization of same-sex marriage \nand the continuation of the War on Terror are inherently linked in producing this fairly \nnew brand of mainstream queer politics. I do so by exposing the particular ways in which \nthe defensibility of the good queer—as promoted by liberals, Donald Trump, and other \nlikeminded Republican leaders40—is contingent upon the construction of the bad Muslim \nas savage, religiously zealous, morally devoid, sexually deviant and racially other. \nFurthermore, I situate this analysis within the broader discourse of “American \nexceptionalism”41—a concept that relies heavily on a belief in the United States as \n                                                        \n38 I use “the image of the nation-state” because this paper does not aim to prove the good queer’s \nde facto immersion into the nation-state but rather the theoretical and rhetorical elements that \nhave sought to place the good queer in the imagined conception of the nation-state. \n39 I do not suggest that the nation-state’s construction of the Muslim other definitively started on \n9/11 (indeed, the othering of the Muslim is part of a long tradition in the West dating back to the \nSpanish Inquisition and has reappeared in various temporal waves); rather, I highlight this \nmoment in order to mark the start of the War on Terror as the official activation of an enormous \napparatus seeking to define, target, and destroy the state’s purported enemies.  \n40 See Paul Ryan’s post-Orlando comments: Johnson, Chris. \"Republicans Recognize LGBT \nMassacre Victims, but Mum on Rights.\" Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT \nRights.

Defining the Muslim Threat to the Queer and the Nation \n \nThe seemingly abrupt arrival of the good queer as a defensible citizen must not \nmerely be understood as an isolated phenomenon but as part of a larger project to \nsystemically filter and weed out adversaries of the nation-state. Just as unwed queer \nfolks, prostitutes, and heterosexual women of color on welfare, for example, emerge all \nthe more deviant against their newly “legalized” queer-marrying counterparts, so too does \nthe Muslim body become the object of intensified surveillance, discipline, and \npunishment at home and abroad. In Terrorist Assemblages, Jasbir K. Puar coins the term \n“homonationalism” to describe the process by which the emergence of a “pro-gay” \nnational discourse supports the nation-state’s mission to other and target suspect Muslim \nbodies; she writes, “For contemporary forms of U.S. nationalism and patriotism, the \nproduction of gay and queer bodies is crucial to the deployment of nationalism, insofar as \nthese perverse bodies reiterate heterosexuality as the norm but also because certain \ndomesticated homosexual bodies provide ammunition to reinforce nationalist projects.”42 \nIndeed, her reference to “certain domesticated homosexual bodies [that] provide \n                                                                                                                                                                     \n \n42 Puar, Jasbir K.

Print. \n 20 \nammunition to reinforce nationalist projects” concerns those good queers whose \nacquiescence to marriage and other expressions of normative sexuality guarantees their \npassage into the nation-state, imagined or otherwise. The domestication of the queer thus \nbecomes crucial to the process by which the nation-state reimagines who it is and, \nconversely, who it is not. Accordingly, the good queer is deployed not only as a \nmouthpiece for the nation’s principles but also as a weapon43 against the nation’s primary \nadversary—the Muslim terrorist—from whom the good queer is definitively \ndistinguished.   \nIndeed, the legalization of same-sex marriage throughout the Western world has \nproven integral to the production of this queer-versus-Muslim mythology. Referring to \nthe nature of these ideological forces prior to the Obergefell ruling in 2015, Puar writes \nthe following:  \nGay marriage, ‘less about gay rights and more about codifying European values,’ has \nbecome a steep but necessary insurance premium in Europe, whereby an otherwise \nambivalent if not hostile populace can guarantee that extra bit of security that is bought \nby yet another marker in this distance between barbarism and civilization, one that \njustifies further targeting of a perversely sexualized and racialized Muslim population \n(pedophilic, sexually lascivious, and excessive, yet perversely repressed) who refuse to \nproperly assimilate, in contrast to the upright homosexuals engaged in sanctioned kinship \nnorms… Among other groups, OutRage!44 is codifying, for Europeans but also implicitly \nfor Americans, that Muslims are an especial threat to homosexuals, that Muslim \nfundamentalists have deliberately and specifically targeted homosexuals, and that the \nparameters of this opposition correlate with those of the war on terror: civilization versus \nbarbarism.45  \n  \nTouted as an indicator of the West’s civilizational prowess, the recent emergence of \nsame-sex marriage proves remarkably convenient as a cogwheel in the West’s ever-\n                                                        \n43 By invoking “weapon,” I do so both figuratively (as in the good queer’s rhetorical \ndefensibility) and literally (taking into account the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in 2010 and \nthe effective inclusion and recognition of LGB military service members).  \n44 OutRage! is a British-based LGBTQ organization \n45 Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke \nUP, 2008. 20. Print. \n 21 \nevolving War-on-Terror story. Interestingly, today’s Republican leaders who promote the \nprotection of LGBTQ folks against “Islamic terror” also sought to constitutionally ban \nsame-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples not long ago (in 1999, in Paul \nRyan’s case).46 The present-day promotion of queer-defensibility relies heavily on long-\nstanding constructions of the Middle East as breeding-grounds for bloodthirsty zealots \nand of Muslims as racialized, sexualized, barbarous subjects. The racialization of \nMuslims is aided by a confluence of factors; indeed, numerous physical identifiers—such \nas dress, behavior, and phenotypic expressions—become legible to Westerners only \nthrough traditional Orientalist translations47 and present-day efforts to group Muslims \naccording to essentialized tropes—the infidel savage, slave/captive, terrorist, and \nimmigrant.48 These hegemonic characterizations of Muslims thus undergird the rhetorical \nfoundations of the War on Terror and a western investment in promoting its civil \nvalues—including domesticated queerness—against the purported savagery and \nintolerance of the Muslim world.  \n Indeed, the West’s commitment to imagining and developing this queer-versus-\nMuslim discourse may be read as a crucial element in the furtherance of American-\nexceptionalism mythologies and parallel calls to war. Describing the fundamentally \nironic conditions of “American exceptionalism,” Jasbir Puar writes, “the United States \ncreates the impression that empire is beyond the pale of it own morally upright behavior, \nsuch that all violences of the state are seen, in some moral cultural, or political fashion as \nanything but the violence of empire. U.S. exceptionalism hangs on a narrative of \n                                                        \n46 Ring, Trudy. \"As House Speaker, Paul Ryan Will Be as Antigay as John \nBoehner.\" ADVOCATE.

As such, the \nmainstreaming of homonationalism and particular notions of “queer rights” opportunely \naccommodates long-standing narratives of American exceptionalism and corresponding \nefforts to monitor, regulate, and enforce bloodshed across the Muslim world under the \nguise of moral-politicking.  \n \nF. Practicing Exceptionalism in the Middle East \n  \nAlthough fairly recent in the scheme of American exceptionalism, the promotion \nof queer-defensibility as a justification for warfare against Muslims is not unprecedented \non the global stage. Dubbed “pinkwashing” by queer and trans activists, efforts by the \nIsraeli government to brand Israel as “gay friendly”50 in contrast to its “homophobic” \nPalestinian neighbors have proven central to Israeli military practices and public \nrelations. This discourse hinges on furthering the notion of “Israeli exceptionalism” in its \ntolerance of homosexuality in order to deflect interrogative arguments concerning \noccupation, settler colonialism, and apartheid and to legitimize its brutal military efforts \nin the Palestinian territories. Highlighting the methods by which pinkwashing raises \nIsrael as “civilized” and racializes Palestinians as “barbaric, homophobic, uncivilized, \n                                                        \n49 Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke \nUP, 2008. 8. Print. \n50 It is important to note that Israel does not permit same-sex marriage but relies on vague notions \nof “gay friendliness” and the promotion of LGBTQ tourism in order to advance this image.   \n 23 \nsuicide-bombing fanatics,” Puar writes, “In reproducing orientalist tropes of Palestinian \nsexual backwardness, [Israel] also denies the impact of colonial occupation on the \ndegradation and containment of Palestinian cultural norms and values. Pinkwashing \nharnesses global gays as a new source of affiliation, recruiting liberal gays into a dirty \nbargaining of their own safety against the oppression of Palestinians, now perforce \nrebranded as ‘gay unfriendly.’”51 Although the Israeli nation-state has been advancing \nsuch “pro-gay” messaging for years with the backing of the US, queer-defensibility as a \nbudding strategy within the US nation-state’s own warmongering platform has curiously \nmaterialized only after the legalization of same-sex marriage. Indeed, this revelation \nfurther evidences the critical role that “legalizing queerness”—with all its respectable \nbells and whistles attached—has played in mobilizing emergent nationalist mythologies \ntowards hawkish recourse globally. \nBefore the queer defense came into fruition, the enforcement of American \nexceptionalism in the Muslim world manifested in efforts to restore “gender equality,” \ncentering the liberation of Muslim women from the oppression of Muslim men and, for \nall intents and purposes, Islam altogether. After President George W. Bush launched the \nWar on Terror on October 7, 2001, First Lady Laura Bush became the quintessential \nspokesperson for promoting the liberation of the Afghan woman under the Taliban. \nIndeed, the First Lady (alongside her husband) played a decisive role in explicitly linking \n“feminism” to the US military bombardment of Afghanistan, famously pronouncing “the \nfight against terrorism [as] also a fight for the rights and dignity of women” in a radio \n                                                        \n51 Puar, Jasbir. \"Israel's Gay Propaganda War.\" The Guardian. Guardian News and Media, 01 July \n2010.  \n \n 24 \naddress to the nation.52  The Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF)—a nongovernmental \norganization committed to “Stopping Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan,”53 among other \nissues—echoed the First Lady’s words and promoted the war as a “benevolent” cause \nagainst the gender-segregated conditions in Afghanistan, rallying policymakers and the \nAmerican public around the “equitable” principles driving US intervention. The FMF’s \nseemingly admirable campaign centered on dislodging the authority of the Taliban, \ninserting a democratic government composed of Afghan women, providing emergency \nhumanitarian assistance, and aiding in the reconstruction of the economy and \ninfrastructure of Afghanistan.   \nThe American public’s backing of the war in Afghanistan was in large part \nsupported by this “emancipatory” rhetoric. However women’s studies scholar Ann Russo \ninterrupts this hegemonic US-savior discourse by highlighting the extent to which these \n“humanitarian” objectives served to reinforce notions of US superiority and \n“benevolence” in order to rationalize military control and intervention. In her critical \nanalysis of the Foundation, she writes the following: \nThe FMF campaign assumes ‘Western’ superiority through its ahistorical and Orientalist \nfocus on ‘the veil’ and gender segregation as symbolic of women’s oppression and its \nimplicit assumption that the US embodies gender equality and women’s human rights. \nThis Orientalist logic constructs an absolute difference between the ‘West’ and the ‘East’/ \n‘self’ and ‘other’. It does so by erasing the history and politics of Afghanistan and by \nprojecting a cultural barbarity in need of a civilizing mission. The assumption of \nsuperiority and benevolence is possible because the FMF evades its own implication in \nthe politics of the region and condones the terms of imperialism – the right to control, the \n                                                        \n52 Bush, Laura. \"Laura Bush on Taliban Oppression of Women.\" Radio Broadcast. 17 Nov. 2001. \nAddress. \n53 See the campaign to “Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan” of 1997: \"Campaign for Afghan \nWomen & Girls - Feminist Majority Foundation.\" Campaign for Afghan Women & Girls \n- Feminist Majority Foundation.

She challenges these efforts to defend US militarization as exercises in \n“benevolence,” calling attention to their critical role in reifying Western dominance over \ncultural and political autonomies of peoples abroad—particularly those in the \npredominantly Muslim and Arab countries of the “Orient.” Accordingly, the “liberation \nof the Afghan woman” reveals itself as yet another manufactured alibi in the furtherance \nof US geopolitical hegemony. \nIndeed, this protectionist discourse reminds us of the substantial role that moral-\npoliticking has played in activating the massive US war-machine as well as of the \nstrength with which it resonates today. It is the state’s capacity to project a “moral cause” \nonto the conflict that sustains the War on Terror, insofar as the moral politics of the \nmoment remain relevant to the American public. Since its original launch fifteen years \nago, the story of the War on Terror continues to evolve and re-introduce itself according \nto the authoritative forces of contemporary US politics; we have watched its agenda \ntransform from “protecting the Afghan woman” in 2001 to “protecting the American \nqueer” in 2016, all the while holding our breath on the defensibility of the war itself. \nThese changes expose the extent to which the terms of the War on Terror remain \nmalleable and relevant in accordance with shifting political tones on US soil, enabling the \nconflict to persist with indefinite reach.     \n                                                        \n54 Russo, Ann. \"The Feminist Majority Foundation's Campaign to Stop Gender \nApartheid.\" International Feminist Journal of Politics 8.4 (2006): n. pag. Web. \n \n 26 \n \nIV. Conclusion: The Stakes of the War on Terror Story  \n \n The convergence of the politics of marriage equality and the aging War on Terror \nreflects the sheer stamina of contemporary American warfare ideology. The invocation of \nqueer-defensibility as fodder for the already-immense counterterror state is revealing in \ntwo fundamental ways: on the one hand, it exposes a reimagined nation-state in which \nprivileged queer folks now find home and security, and on the other, it demonstrates the \ntenacity of the War on Terror and its ability to persevere simply by reimagining the \nthreats that are posed against the nation-state. Between Congress’ declaration of war on \nSeptember 14, 200155 and the signing of the Patriot Act into law on October 21, 200156, \nthe US government became equipped with an unprecedented degree of military and \nsurveillance authority in the name of national security. Indeed, when President Bush \nannounced “our War on Terror begins with al-Qaeda, but it does not end there; it will not \nend until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated,”57 \nhe effectively opened the door for a counterterror campaign whose unforeseeably \nimmense capacities would have surprised perhaps even him. National imagination has \nplayed a key role in defining the parameters of the conflict; as Joseph Masco describes, \n“The innovation of the War on Terror is that it formally rejects deterrence, with its focus \non global stability, as an objective in favor of preemption—an unending manipulation of \nthe future for national advantage.”58 Rooted in the provocation of fear and the boundless \n                                                        \n55 H.R.

Print. \n \n 27 \nimagined possibilities of existential threat to the union, the War on Terror prospers in its \nability to morph and seemingly respond to national sentiment, wherever it lands at any \ngiven moment. Whether or not the infrastructures of the War on Terror are actually \nactivated in the name of protecting queer folks from “Islamic terrorism” is beside the \npoint. It is of more immediate concern that those innocent Muslim and Arab communities \nacross the Middle East, South Asia, and the Western world—which since 9/11 have \nbecome the sites of ritualized surveillance, scrutiny, and violence under the pretense of \n“national security” and the promotion of “Western” values—become centered in \nmainstream conceptions of the War on Terror as well as the rhetorical ploys and moral-\npoliticking that continue to sustain it.  \n",
