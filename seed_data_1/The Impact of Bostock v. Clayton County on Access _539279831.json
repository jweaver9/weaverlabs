SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW  485 THE IMPACT OF BOSTOCK V. CLAYTON COUNTY ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR LGBTQ PERSONS ABSTRACT LGBTQ individuals face countless acts of discrimination in health care insurance and delivery. In spite of this inequality, there are zero LGBTQ-inclusive health insurance protections in over half of the United States. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (Title VII) and Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) are two federal statutes that prohibit discrimination, in relevant part, on the basis of sex. Both federal statutes have been greatly impacted by the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which interpreted “sex” in Title VII to include gender identity and sexual orientation. This Article explains how Bostock protects LGBTQ persons from discrimination in employer-provided health insurance under Title VII. Bostock’s scope extends beyond health insurance and into health care delivery, as demonstrated by its applicability to Section 1557 of the ACA (Section 1557). This Article demonstrates how Section 1557—where its enabling statutes do not include Title VII—should prohibit discrimination regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. Lastly, this Article emphasizes the importance of state action, for example in public accommodations laws, in the absence of clear and explicit federal LGBTQ protections.   SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 486 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 15:485 I.  INTRODUCTION The lives of LGBTQ persons are constantly threatened by discrimination in health care insurance and health care delivery through either delays or denials of medically necessary care.1 In addition, LGBTQ persons frequently encounter providers who use harsh language, refuse to touch patients, and improperly blame patients for their health status.2 LGBTQ persons who experience such discrimination are at risk of avoiding medical help altogether, creating a negative, long-lasting impact on health outcomes.3 Yet, despite these evident disparities, twenty-seven states and four territories have no laws providing LGBTQ-inclusive health insurance protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and forty-five percent of LGBTQ individuals live in such states.4 Only sixteen states, one territory, and the District of Columbia (D.C.) expressly prohibit such discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity,5 although such prohibitions have limited application to employer-provided health insurance.6 And only twenty-four states and D.C. explicitly prohibit transgender exclusions in health insurance coverage, which are “policies that bar health insurers from explicitly refusing to cover transgender-related health care benefits.”7  Federal law has long prohibited discrimination in health care insurance and delivery, but whether these laws apply to the LGBTQ community has been controversial and unresolved in any determinative respect.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2022] BOSTOCK ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE 487 Civil Rights Act (Title VII) prohibits discrimination in employee benefits, including health insurance,8 but until the Supreme Court ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, it was not clear whether this prohibition covered health benefits needed by LGBTQ persons. Second, Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)9 prohibits both health care providers (i.e., delivery) and insurance companies (i.e., coverage) from engaging in discrimination based on sex.10 Whether, however, this provision applies to LGBTQ status and gender identity has been a matter of great contention.11 Bostock provides a resolution to this controversy.  In a six-to-three decision, the Supreme Court in Bostock held that an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates the sex discrimination prohibition under only Title VII.12 Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, writing for the majority, interprets the term “sex,” in the context of employment under Title VII, to include sexual orientation and gender identity.13 Because Title VII applies to employer-provided health insurance, Bostock’s interpretation of “sex” extends to employee health benefits.14 This is significant for the nearly fifty percent of the population who receive health insurance coverage through their employment.15 And although so many employees are excluded from Bostock’s protections within Title VII, its impact extends more broadly because of its application to the interpretation of Section 1557 of the ACA (Section 1557).16 Section 1557 prohibits discrimination in health insurance more broadly than insurance provided by employers under Title VII. An individual shall not “be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any health program or activity, any part of which is receiving Federal financial assistance, including contracts of insurance.”17 The   8.

The Obama administration promulgated regulations (2016 Final Rule) that included sex stereotyping and gender identity in the definition of “sex.”21 The Trump administration rescinded the Obama-era regulations and promulgated new regulations (2020 Final Rule) that omit gender identity and sex stereotyping from the definition of “sex.”22 Following this, in January 2021, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. signed Executive Order 13,988 (EO 13,988), which directs all federal agencies that enforce statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex to review and ascertain whether Bostock impacts those regulations.23 Because the language used in Title VII is identical to the language used in Section 1557,24 Bostock should be applied to interpret Section 1557 as prohibiting sex discrimination based on gender identity and transgender status. This Article demonstrates how Bostock applies to protect against LGBTQ discrimination in employer-provided health insurance under Title VII.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2022] BOSTOCK ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE 489 orientation and Title VII prohibits discrimination in employee benefits on the basis of sex, employers cannot discriminate on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation in health benefits plans. As a result, employer-provided health insurance must incorporate LGBTQ protections and coverage to assure that they are in compliance with Title VII. This Article also argues that Section 1557, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of “sex” in both health insurance and health care delivery that fall within the bounds of this statute, should be interpreted to include a prohibition against discrimination against LGBTQ persons (i.e., sexual orientation and gender identity). Although Bostock does not interpret Section 1557, the majority opinion’s broad approach to interpreting Title VII should be applied to Section 1557 and others like it.  This Article further points out the significance of states incorporating sexual orientation and gender identity in their public accommodations law.25 Bostock—which interpreted a federal statute—does not extend protections to LGBTQ persons in places of public accommodation, as controlled by federal law. This is because federal public accommodations law does not explicitly prohibit “sex” discrimination, which is precisely what Bostock impacts. As a result, states must take action to protect LGBTQ persons in public spaces, like hospitals, doctors’ offices, and other public health care entities. First, Part II provides an overview of Bostock’s majority and dissenting opinions, as well as Justice Gorsuch’s textualist approach to interpreting Title VII. Next, Part III examines the most common health benefit supplied by employers—health insurance—under Title VII. Part IV then discusses how employers might assure LGBTQ protections within health coverage benefits under Title VII, illustrated by an employer assessment tool and recent responses in state law. Part V briefly describes how the Obama and Trump administrations each issued regulations to implement Section 1557’s nondiscrimination provision, with the Obama administration including gender identity/sex stereotyping within the definition of “sex” under the statute and the Trump administration excluding it. Part VI further examines the influence of Bostock on health care by applying Bostock’s approach to statutory interpretation of the term “sex” to Section 1557. This Part argues that President Trump’s 2020 Final Rule must be rejected as inconsistent with the statute and argues that the review mandated by EO 13,988 must conclude that Section 1557’s prohibition of discrimination based on sex includes sexual orientation and gender identity. Lastly, Part VII demonstrates the importance of state public accommodations laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in public health care spaces.    25. See discussion infra Part VII. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 490 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 15:485 II.  OVERVIEW OF BOSTOCK A. The Consolidation of Three Cases26 Bostock consolidates three separate cases that all address discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. The first plaintiff, Gerald Bostock, worked as a child welfare advocate for Clayton County, Georgia, where the county won several national awards under his management.27 Despite Mr. Bostock’s accomplishments, he was fired for conduct “unbecoming” a county employee shortly after participating in a gay recreational softball league.28 The second plaintiff, Donald Zarda, was employed by Altitude Express in New York as a skydiving instructor.29 Despite working for the company for several years, Mr. Zarda was fired days after mentioning that he was gay.30 The last plaintiff, Aimee Stephens, worked at R. G. & G. R. Harris Funeral Homes in Michigan, where she initially presented herself as a male.31 In her sixth year with the company, however, Ms. Stephens decided to “live and work full-time as a woman,” particularly after clinicians diagnosed her with gender dysphoria and advised that she live as a woman.32 Following this, the funeral home fired Ms. Stephens.33  In each of these cases, an employer allegedly fired an employee simply for being homosexual or transgender, causing each employee to sue, alleging “unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex” under Title VII.34 Lower courts were unable to come to a consistent conclusion; the Eleventh Circuit held that Title VII “does not prohibit employers from firing employees for being gay,” while the Second and Sixth Circuits held that sexual orientation and transgender status, respectively, are protected under Title VII’s sex discrimination prohibition.35 B. Case Holding Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joined. The majority held: “An employer violates Title VII when it intentionally fires an   26. Bostock v. Clayton County was consolidated with Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda and R.G. & G.R.

Because discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender status requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex, Title VII is violated when an employee suffers from intentional discrimination because of such identities.39  C. Dissenting Views Justice Alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joined, while Justice Kavanaugh filed a separate dissenting opinion. Justice Alito opened his dissent by criticizing the majority opinion: “There is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation.”40 In Justice Alito’s views, the opinion does not merely enforce the terms of the statute, but rather takes on a new approach of updating old statutes so that they “better reflect the current values of society.”41 Justice Alito also emphasizes that the question in Bostock is not whether discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity should be outlawed, but whether Congress did that in 1964; to him, “it indisputably did not.”42 Interestingly, Justice Alito notes that this Court’s holding may intensify the debate on health benefits since “[t]ransgender employees have brought suit under Title VII to challenge employer-provided health insurance plans that do not cover . . . sex reassignment surgery,” and similar claims have been brought under the ACA.43 Further, Justice Kavanaugh’s dissent largely agrees with Justice Alito’s and argues that the Court majority is acting in a legislative capacity: under the Constitution’s separation of powers, “it was Congress’s role, not this Court’s, to amend Title VII.”44   36.

Justice Gorsuch’s Textualist Approach The late Justice Scalia sought to derive statutory interpretation from their words alone and to ignore unenacted context, a theory termed “New Textualism.”45 Influenced by Justice Scalia, Justice Gorsuch determined the ordinary meaning of Title VII by examining key statutory terms, assessing their impact on the consolidated cases, and using Supreme Court precedent.46 Notably, Justice Gorsuch did not rely on legislative history or previous agency decisions or guidance.47 Rather, Justice Gorsuch primarily relied on the language of the statute or, in other words, the ordinary meaning of the text,48 which is now shown as a possible advocacy tool for disparate treatment49 cases under Title VII. In fact, throughout the opinion, Justice Gorsuch emphasized that he was following the text and nothing more.50 And even though the outcome of Bostock may be contrary to the intention of Title VII’s drafters, Justice Gorsuch provides the following rationale for employing textualism: Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. Likely, they weren’t thinking about many of the Act’s consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis of motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male employees. But the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest. Only the written word is the law[.]51    45.

As a result of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion, sex—a protected characteristic—includes sexual orientation and gender identity. As shown in Bostock, employees with such characteristics are considered “protected classes” and have a claim under Title VII if they can show an employer’s conduct constituted disparate treatment based on their protected characteristic (e.g., sexual orientation and/or gender identity).  50.

III.  EMPLOYER-PROVIDED INSURANCE UNDER TITLE VII AND THE EEOC A. Title VII For employers with fifteen or more employees, Title VII makes it “unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his [or her] compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”53 Title VII forbids discrimination in any aspect of employment, including: hiring and firing; compensation or classification of employees; promotion or layoff; marketing; trainings; retirement; disability leave; or other terms and conditions of employment.54 Title VII’s inclusion of “terms and conditions” indicates that employer-sponsored health benefits are covered under Title VII, given that health insurance is typically included as part of the employment contract.55 According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 158,000,000 people (or about 49.6% of the U.S. population) receive employer-provided health insurance coverage.56  There has been disagreement on whether Title VII protects LGBTQ workers against discrimination—that is, until Bostock. The Court, however, had previously held that employment discrimination based on sexual stereotypes violates Title VII57 and held that an individual can file a same-sex sexual harassment claim under Title VII.58 In fact, these cases have been used to argue that “sex” under Title VII reaches gender identity and transgender status.59    52.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Established by Congress and the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is an independent enforcement agency that has the authority to receive, initiate, and investigate discrimination charges filed against employers covered by Title VII.60 Additionally, the EEOC has the authority to provide interpretative guidance on Title VII.61 EEOC guidance on health insurance states that an employer must “non-discriminatorily provide to all similarly situated employees the same opportunity to enroll in any health plans it offers.”62 As a result of Title VII and EEOC guidance, an employer must also ensure that the terms of its health benefits are non-discriminatory.63 For the protected category “sex,” the EEOC has long taken the position that LGBTQ discrimination is sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII, as now supported by Bostock.64 IV.  IMPACT OF BOSTOCK ON EMPLOYER-PROVIDED INSURANCE UNDER TITLE VII Bostock is not the first time a Supreme Court decision has successfully impacted employer-sponsored health care plan requirements.65 Although Bostock does not resolve or even address what constitutes a discriminatory coverage decision within a health benefits plan, the decision includes LGBTQ status and gender identity in the conversation of sex-based discrimination and discusses the need to safeguard protections against such discrimination within employment. Thus, Bostock holds heavy implications for employee health benefit plans. As indicated by law firms, employers should “review employee  Title VII. But see, e.g., Dawson v.

The two central principles applied in the evaluation are the analysis of coverage and disparate impact.68 Employers are advised to evaluate their health benefit plans using these two principles, and ask themselves (1) whether differences in coverage plans between men and women are justified (as in the risk insured against is not mutually contractible—which means “where the underlying condition affects, or the treatment/test is available to, both men and women”) and (2) whether their standard to deny insurance coverage disproportionately affects members of a protected group.69 This guidance, however, does not have the force and effect of law and is not meant to bind the public.70 So, excluding the limited and restricted guidance offered by the EEOC,71 there is no specific regulatory list of items or categories that must be covered in order to avoid the risk of sex discrimination under Title VII or under Bostock.

States Responding to Bostock: New York, Wisconsin, Michigan, Washington The Supreme Court’s decision in Bostock is impacting actions among the states too, as states are using Bostock to interpret their own statutes and regulations. On June 28, 2020, for example, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued Insurance Circular Letter No. 13 (Letter No. 13), which confirmed the prohibition of discrimination “based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and transgender status in relation to insurance.”77 The purpose of Letter No. 13 is to remind health insurers (and other types of insurers) “of the requirements related to non-discrimination   77. LISETTE JOHNSON, N.Y. STATE DEP’T OF FIN. SERVS., INSURANCE CIRCULAR LETTER NO. 13 (June 28, 2020), https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/circular_letters/cl2020_13. SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 498 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 15:485 protections.”78 Additionally, Letter No. 13 was published in response to the federal government’s action under the Trump administration in removing “protections prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or transgender status.”79 Recently, the DFS adopted a regulation that states “an issuer shall not discriminate based on an insured’s or prospective insured’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or transgender status”—which applies to “individual, small group, and large group . . . health insurance policies and contracts that provide hospital, surgical, or medical expense coverage,” and student health insurance policies.80 This regulation also prohibits exclusions for “treatments related to gender transition, gender dysphoria, or gender incongruence”; thus, DFS will not only deny such language that appears to exclude these treatments but also take action for failure to adhere to these laws and regulations.81 On June 29, 2020, the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance in the State of Wisconsin (OCI) issued a bulletin in response to Bostock detailing the legal requirements regarding sex discrimination in their Wisconsin-affiliated health insurance policies.82 The OCI bulletin asserts that it is unlawful to discriminate by excluding, limiting or denying “benefits to an insured on the basis of the insured’s gender identity” and further mandates that all insurers—in both the private and public sectors—and “self-funded non-federal governmental plans [must fully] comply with state insurance laws for policies currently in effect.”83 As a result, OCI states it will not accept any filings from health insurers that “contain exclusions or limitations on benefits that are based on a person’s gender identity”84—which is similar to DFS’s policy in New York.  On August 11, 2020, the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (DIFS) issued Bulletin 2020-34-INS (Bulletin), which confirmed that it, like Bostock, interprets “sex” in “all statutes and rules [under its   78.

The State of Washington is unique in that it established LGBTQ protections before Bostock was decided but expanded upon these protections afterwards and focused on specific obstacles to gender-affirming care. On May 12, 2021, Washington enacted a new law that requires compliance from individual and small group health insurance plans issued on and after January 1, 2022.92 These plans cannot “deny or limit coverage for gender-affirming treatment when it is medically necessary and prescribed by a medical professional” and cannot “apply categorical cosmetic or blanket exclusions to gender-affirming treatment.”93 Additionally, Washington, unlike other states, explicitly lists services that insurers can no longer categorically exclude: facial feminization, tracheal shaves, hair electrolysis, mastectomies, breast reductions, breast   85.

Although some states are restricting medical care for LGBTQ youth, others may decide to follow New York, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Washington’s approach in affirming Bostock’s definition of sex within all state statutes and rules. These state agencies’ interpretation of their statutes and regulations can inform the analysis used to determine what suffices as discriminatory actions in certain situations and, as a result, can be fairly susceptible to litigation challenges. V.  OVERVIEW OF SECTION 1557 On March 23, 2010, the ACA was enacted, and with it came Section 1557, which prohibits discrimination in certain health programs or activities—including providers, hospitals, and medical systems—that receive federal financial assistance.95 Section 1557 incorporates protections from four existing civil rights laws: Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) (race, color, national origin), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) (sex), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (Age Discrimination Act) (age), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, codified as 29 U.S.C. § 794 (Section 504) (disability).96 The language of Section 1557 specifically states that Title VI, Title IX, the Age Discrimination Act, and Section 504 should be used as sources for interpretation and enforcement mechanisms of Section 1557—notably excluding Title VII.97 The administrative regulations that implement and interpret the ACA can vary by administration. For example, the inclusion of the term “sex” in Section 1557 stems from Title IX and is as follows: “No person . . . shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be subjected to discrimination.”98 With this, the Obama and Trump administrations have interpreted “sex” quite differently. The interpretation of the term “sex” has been a matter of significant controversy.  On May 18, 2016, the Obama administration promulgated regulations to specifically include “gender identity” and “sex-stereotyping” in its definition of   94. S.B. 5313, 67th Leg., Reg. Sess.

Trump removed this provision as well, rolling back even more LGBTQ protections.102 As a result, health care providers may be allowed to deny care to those “who are transgender or who do not conform to traditional sex stereotypes,” which may also worsen health disparities among LGBTQ persons.103  VI.  IMPACT OF BOSTOCK ON HEALTH CARE Section 1557 is one of many examples demonstrating the breadth of Bostock’s influence as a result of Justice Gorsuch’s broad approach in statutory interpretation.104 Because courts traditionally rely on Title VII precedent when interpreting Title IX105—and Section 1557106—Bostock, which interprets Title VII, challenges the survivability of the 2020 Final Rule and establishes the basis of EO 13,988 and future rulemaking under the Biden administration.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 502 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 15:485 Section 1557 prohibits discrimination against LGBTQ persons in health care, which also impacts both health care delivery and access for all such persons. A. Application of Bostock Under Title VII to Section 1557 Under Title IX Title VII statutory language is identical to Title IX (and thus Section 1557), which Bostock effectively applies to, as demonstrated by the following analysis: (1) Title IX is one of Section 1557’s enabling statutes; (2) Title IX prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex”;107 (3) Title VII prohibits discrimination “because of . . . sex”;108 (4) throughout the opinion, Justice Gorsuch substitutes “because of” for “on the basis of,” signifying that these two phrases are interchangeable;109 (5) Bostock interprets Title VII to prohibit discrimination “on the basis of” homosexuality or transgender status, of which “homosexuality [or sexual orientation] and transgender status are inextricably bound up with sex”;110 (7) therefore, sexual orientation and transgender status are included in the definition of “sex” in not only Bostock and, in turn, Title VII, but also under Title IX and Section 1557. Overall, because Title VII’s “definition of sex” has consistently informed the “definition of sex” in Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is considered sex discrimination under Section 1557 and is therefore prohibited. B. Rejection of President Trump’s 2020 Final Rule Because EO 13,988 mandates a review using Bostock as guidance, the review should conclude that the 2020 Final Rule should be rescinded and replaced with language consistent with Bostock. In part because of Bostock, two federal district courts have already issued nationwide preliminary injunctions, preventing the Trump administration from implementing parts of the 2020 Final Rule.111 Notably, federal courts, both before and after Bostock, have determined that sex discrimination under Title IX includes gender identity, and that Bostock “has significant implications for the meaning of Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination”112—which is precisely the analysis laid out above. As a result, challenges to the 2020 Final Rule will likely be successful because, first, courts   107. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a).  108. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).  109. Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 140 S.

C. How Does Bostock Impact Health Care Access for LGBTQ Persons? . . . New Era of LGBTQ Protections Under President Biden The existence of Bostock cements the long-term survivability of EO 13,988, its growing application to health care (via Section 1557), and its impact on LGBTQ access to health care. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed EO 13,988, aimed to prevent and combat discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.115 As a result of the decision in Bostock, the Biden administration commits “to fully enforce Title VII and other laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation” and “address overlapping forms of discrimination.”116 President Biden claims that under Bostock’s reasoning, laws and their respective promogulated rules and regulations that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX (and thus Section 1557)—”prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation, so long as the laws do not contain sufficient indications to the contrary.”117 Discrimination solely on the basis of sexual orientation was not included in the definition of “sex” in either the 2016 or 2020 rules,118 yet   113. Wayne Turner, Health Insurers Should be Wary of Trump Regulatory Rollback, NAT’L HEALTH L. PROGRAM (Aug. 6, 2020), https://healthlaw.org/health-insurers-should-be-wary-of-trump-regulatory-rollback/. The federal district court held that “Section 1557 protections against sex discrimination include gender identity, and invalidated Medicaid coverage exclusions for gender affirming care,” despite falling under the protection of a different statute. Id. (discussing the decision in Flack v. Wisconsin Department of Social Services, No. 3:18-cv-00309-wmc (W.D. Wis. 2019)).  114. See, e.g., Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch.

But the Biden administration failed to provide a specific timeline for issuing a proposed rule for Section 1557. In the meantime, however, Secretary Becerra announced that HHS will interpret and enforce Section 1557 prohibition on sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity as guidance for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in managing complaints and investigations.121 Accepting and investigating complaints will allow OCR to collect data and build an evidentiary record that can be used in future rulemaking.  It is important to note what this new HHS interpretation fails to do. First, HHS has not resolved the pending litigation over Section 1557 implementing rules (2016 Final Rule versus 2020 Final Rule). Second, HHS has not provided additional guidance on how to not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.122 As EO 13,988 states, “people should be able to access healthcare . . . without being subjected to sex discrimination.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2022] BOSTOCK ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE 505 individuals can lead long, healthy lives,” and ultimately improve overall LGBTQ health.124 LGBTQ persons have a right to be free from discrimination in health care, and EO 13,988, which explicitly relies on Bostock, paves the way to enforcing these rights and eliminating barriers in health care.  VII.  BEYOND BOSTOCK: PROTECTION UNDER STATE PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS  As previously discussed, Section 1557 does prohibit discrimination by health care facilities that receive federal financial assistance. Examples of federal financial assistance include the following: providers participating in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and other Medicaid programs, hospitals and nursing homes (Medicare Part A), Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare Part C) (e.g., health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and preferred provider organizations (PPOs)), Prescription Drug Plan sports and Medicare Advantage Drug Plans (Medicare Part D), social service agencies, and insurers participating in the ACA-established Marketplaces (federal and state) and receiving premium tax credits.125 Although infrequent, a health care facility may not have to comply with Section 1557’s nondiscriminatory provision if it does not receive any federal financial assistance. The lack of mandatory protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in health care may put LGBTQ persons at risk. Because Title VII does not reach health care facilities in the delivery of care—another critical gap—Bostock, while revolutionary, does not extend protections to LGBTQ persons in places of public accommodation, such as hospitals, pharmacies, and doctors’ offices. This again becomes especially significant for health care entities who do not have to comply with Section 1557. Places of public accommodations are not impacted because Bostock impacts only areas of federal law where sex discrimination is explicitly prohibited. Because the applicable federal statutes (Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964126 and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990127) only cover race, color, religion, national origin, and disability—omitting “sex,”128—LGBTQ   124.

But LGBTQ persons may rely on state public accommodations laws to enforce their rights if protections are provided. Places of public accommodation are generally defined as any place of business offering goods, services, facilities, or accommodations to the public.129 Places of public accommodation, for example, can include medical providers, hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and other public health care entities. States can enact public accommodations laws that outlaw discriminatory practices—directly or indirectly refusing, withholding or denying the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations—in a place of public accommodation.130 Colorado131 and New Jersey,132 for example, include sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression as protected characteristics from discrimination in addition to race, color, religion, national origin, disability, and others.  Contrastingly, Pennsylvania, like many other states,133 failed to codify the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression in places of public accommodation.134 Despite this, the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC), the enforcement agency of the enabling state statute, released guidance135 interpreting the law as banning  advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.”) (emphasis added).  129.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2022] BOSTOCK ON ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE 507 “discrimination on the basis of sex assigned at birth, sexual orientation, transgender identity, gender transition, gender identity, and gender expression.”136 This guidance was partially influenced by review of the “evolving case law of interpretations of discrimination ‘because of . . . sex’ under Title VII,” i.e., Bostock.137 Furthermore, many municipalities have taken the responsibility of incorporating LGBTQ-inclusive language into their ordinances. Philadelphia, for example, added sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity as protected classes.138  If a state or city prohibits sex discrimination—including sexual orientation and gender identity—in public accommodations, an LGBTQ resident has the following rights: “right to not to be refused entry, participation, or services because you are transgender or gender nonconforming”; “right to enjoy a business’s services or goods on an equal basis”; “right to dress and present yourself in a manner consistent with your gender identity” without fear of refusal because of someone else’s objection; and “right to be free from harassment.”139 Accordingly, state and local laws are critical in ensuring access and providing protection beyond the scope of what is covered in federal law. VIII.  CONCLUSION  This Article demonstrates that Bostock requires employer-provided health insurance to ensure sex-based protections. These protections encompass both sexual orientation and gender identity due to Bostock’s interpretation of “sex.” Employers are advised to review and revise their health benefits plans to align with Bostock. This Article also advocates that although Bostock does not interpret Section 1557, its approach to interpreting Title VII should be applied to Section 1557—”sex” includes sexual orientation and gender identity—because the language in Section 1557 (Title IX) is identical to the language discussed in Bostock (Title VII). President Biden affirmed this analysis by signing EO 13,988, which predominately relies on Bostock. This interpretation will likely be cemented by legal challenges when the Biden administration promulgates its own final rule to Section 1557. There are still unresolved issues and barriers to access to health care for LGBTQ persons. One barrier, for example, is religious objections under both Title VII and the ACA.140 Second, whether a particular decision involving   136. Id. at 2–3; Bass, supra note 134.  137. PA. HUM. RELS.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 508 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 15:485 coverage of specific services discriminates against LGBTQ employees as compared to other non-LGBTQ employees was left unanswered by Bostock. Therefore, what constitutes a discriminatory coverage decision within an individual’s health benefits plan will likely be addressed by the courts in the near future.  Health care entities who, in reliance on Bostock, implement anti-discriminatory practices for LGBTQ persons may promote themselves as an ally and a LGBTQ friendly space, which helps foster a positive relationship and experience between the patient and provider.141 Because of Bostock, future presidential administrations will not be able to exclude LGBTQ status through regulation or guidance, as the Trump administration did.142 Regardless of the current legal challenges, states are not barred from banning discrimination in health care on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation, or other grounds beyond federal law. This is evident in current state public accommodations laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, where sexual orientation and gender identity are included under the definition of sex. Hence, state action may be the solution until federal law provides a clear answer on how to protect all LGBTQ persons within health care.  HIBA B. AL-RAMAHI*   9, 2021).

Congress, however, could always amend Title VII and the other nondiscrimination statutes to exclude LGBTQ status from the definition of sex.

    "abstract": "LGBTQ individuals face countless acts of discrimination in health care insurance and delivery. In spite of this inequality, there are zero LGBTQ-inclusive health insurance protections in over half of the United States. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (Title VII) and Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) are two federal statutes that prohibit discrimination, in relevant part, on the basis of sex. Both federal statutes have been greatly impacted by the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which interpreted “sex” in Title VII to include gender identity and sexual orientation. This Article explains how Bostock protects LGBTQ persons from discrimination in employer-provided health insurance under Title VII. Bostock’s scope extends beyond health insurance and into health care delivery, as demonstrated by its applicability to Section 1557 of the ACA (Section 1557). This Article demonstrates how Section 1557—where its enabling statutes do not include Title VII—should prohibit discrimination regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. Lastly, this Article emphasizes the importance of state action, for example in public accommodations laws, in the absence of clear and explicit federal LGBTQ protections",
