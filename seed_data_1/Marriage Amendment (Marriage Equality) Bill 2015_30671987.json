    "abstract": "Labor leader Bill Shorten introduced a marriage equality bill to Federal Parliament this week and in his address to the House of Representatives, asked that members \\u27embrace a definition of marriage that respects, values and includes every Australian.\\u27\n\n__\n\nMARRIAGE AMENDMENT (MARRIAGE EQUALITY) BILL 2015\n\nBILL SHORTEN SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT, MONDAY, 1 JUNE 2015\n\nI move that the bill be read a second time.\n\nThe laws of our nation should give us hope.\n\nOur laws should tell our children what we believe.\n\nOur laws should tell strangers who Australians are.\n\nOur laws should be a mirror…reflecting our great and generous country and our free, inclusive society.\n\nAnd our Parliament should be a place where we make things happen rather than sit back and let them happen.\n\nOn marriage equality, for too long we in this Parliament have been following, not leading.\n\nIt is within our power to change this.\n\nThis Parliament can change a law that no longer describes modern Australia…and pass a law of which we can all be proud.\n\nLet us delay no more.\n\nLet us embrace a definition of marriage that respects, values and includes every Australian.\n\nLet us declare, in the house of the Australian people – it is time.\n\nThe right time to make marriage equality, a reality.\n\nThis is a moment bigger than politics.\n\nThis moment does not distract the nation – it complements our hopes for the future.\n\nI know all members of Parliament will engage in a respectful and considered debate, and I hope will be able to exercise a free vote.\n\nI pay tribute to the Member for Sydney, for offering her place on this bill to a member of the Government.\n\nTanya, thank you.\n\nYour actions, the advocacy of Senator Penny Wong and the goodwill of many across the Parliament, prove that bipartisanship is not the problem here.\n\nWhat matters is the outcome, not who owns it.\n\nMadam Speaker\n\nFor decades, the march to equality has been led by remarkable Australians from every part of our country and all walks of life.\n\nGovernments from both sides of politics have delivered real progress too.\n\nThe Fraser Government passed Whitlam law, decriminalising homosexuality in Commonwealth territories, following Don Dunstan’s lead in South Australia.\n\nPaul Keating lifted the ban on Australians who identified as gay serving in our military.\n\nThe Rudd and Gillard governments removed discrimination against same-sex couples from more than 80 laws.\n\nIn Victoria, the Napthine Government expunged the records of people who were charged under long-repealed homosexuality offences.\n\nChanging the Marriage Act is the next, overdue step in the path to true equality.\n\nMadam Speaker\n\nI’m a twin – it’s a special thing, growing up, an inseparable bond.\n\nBut for other twins where one twin is gay and the other is not, the Marriage Act is the only Australian law that separates siblings.\n\nIt’s a double standard which divides families, and our country.\n\nIt’s not fair and it’s not who we are.\n\nAnd it should change.\n\nCurrently, marriage is defined as:\n\n‘the union of a man and a woman”\n\nThose eight words maintain a fiction that any other relationship is somehow inferior.\n\nOur legislation proposes a new definition:\n\n‘the union of two people’ \n\nAnd it allows celebrants the choice of referring to ‘partners’, as well as husband and wife.\n\nTo some, this may seem a small gesture.\n\nIn truth, this means so much, to so many.\n\nTo all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex Australians, we offer change that says: your relationship is equal under the law.\n\nTo the parents, children, friends and families of same-sex partners, just as the people you love are equal and valuable in your eyes, their relationship should be equal and valuable in the eyes of our law.\n\nTo same-sex couples, we offer the right to celebrate your love with the public measure of devotion: marriage.\n\nWhen someone has found not just another person they can live with, but a person they can’t live without, then they should have the same right to the true qualities of a bond that runs deeper than any law.\n\nThe same joy and sacrifice.\n\nThe same care and compassion.\n\nThe same rights and responsibilities.\n\nAnd we say to all young gay people.\n\nWe are proud of you, for who you are. You belong.\n\nWe say to you, you have a right to the same hopes, dreams and opportunities as every other Australian including the right to marry the person you love.\n\nIn removing discrimination from our country’s laws, we strive to eliminate prejudice from our people’s lives.\n\nLet’s be honest.\n\nCasual, unthinking discrimination and deliberate, malicious homophobia alike, are still far too common in our conversations.\n\nIn our schoolyards, our workplaces and our sporting clubs…and even, occasionally, our Parliament too.\n\nThis affects community, neighbourliness, harmony and mental health in our cities and especially our regions and the bush where physical remoteness can aggravate a sense of isolation.\n\nWe know two out of five young Australians who are gay have thought about self-harm or suicide.\n\nTwo out of every five.\n\nWe know a young Australian who identifies as gay is six times more likely to consider taking their own life, compared to their sibling, classmate, colleague or teammate.\n\nSix times.\n\nWhen I was finishing school in the 1980s, youth suicide was still a taboo topic.\n\nI can remember hearing of the passing of young men, and no-one spoke of how they died.\n\nI can close my eyes and see their faces, forever young.\n\nAnd I wonder now, if for some, the stigma and the struggle of imagining a future, lonely, isolated, treated differently was too much to bear.\n\nMarriage equality says to young people who identify as gay, you are never alone. You belong.\n\nThis is an act of fairness for all ages.\n\nOn the weekend, I spoke with Sandra Yates, from Devonport in Tassie.\n\nLike hundreds of other Australian couples, she and her partner Lee Bransden have been forced to travel to New Zealand to marry.\n\nSandra and Lee had hoped to marry at home surrounded by friends and family but Lee is terminally ill, and has been told she only has weeks to live.\n\nTheir community raised money to fund their trip and fulfil their dream.\n\nThey are thrilled to be married…and sad it couldn’t happen here, in the country they love.\n\nLee’s voice should be heard in this place:\n\n“Please, help switch on the&nbsp;light for same-sex couples and take us out of the darkness.”\n\nLee, Sandra, you, your friends and families should not have to wait one day longer for recognition.\n\nAnd this legislation will ensure that same-sex marriages, recognised in another country, are recognised here.\n\nA law that forces our citizens to travel overseas, or to the grounds of another nation’s embassy, to have their relationships recognised is a law not worth keeping.\n\nI have not made a habit of speaking publicly about my faith, and I do not seek to preach to others today.\n\nI do believe in God and I do believe in marriage equality.\n\nFor me, there is nothing contradictory about extending love, compassion, charity and respect beyond heterosexual Australia.\n\nI understand, that for many people of different faiths, this is a complex question, I respect this.\n\nIt is why I support a free vote.\n\nAnd why this legislation makes it clear that no minister of religion can be compelled, or is obliged, to conduct a particular marriage…including one where two people are of the same sex.\n\nAlI ask in return that this respect be mutual.\n\nJust as churches, mosques, temples and synagogues of all faiths and traditions will be free to choose if they consecrate same sex marriages.\n\nLet the same respect allow Australians to freely choose who they marry, without vilification or judgment.\n\nSo often in our history, Australia has led the world in social and economic progress.\n\nThe right to vote, pensions, the eight-hour day.\n\nOur healthcare and superannuation systems are among the best in the world.\n\nBut on marriage equality, we have fallen behind.\n\nLike so many Australians, two Sunday mornings ago, when I first heard the result of the Irish referendum I thought: if the Irish can do it, why can’t we?\n\nHow can Ireland, New Zealand, 37 US States, England, Scotland, South Africa and Canada and Brazil, Iceland and Uruguay be ahead of us?\n\nTwenty countries have already recognised the merit of marriage equality.\n\nI am confident Australia will.\n\nI don’t want us to wait, any longer.\n\nWe cannot assume this change is inevitable.\n\nWe cannot imagine it will just happen.\n\nWe, the 44th Parliament, we have to step up, to rise to the moment.\n\nToday, is neither the beginning, nor the end, of the journey to marriage equality.\n\nBut I hope…with goodwill on all sides, with co-operation, with respect for one another this can be a historic step forward.\n\nGiven a free vote, I believe this Parliament is ready for a definition of marriage which reflects the modern, inclusive and egalitarian Australia we love.\n\nWe are ready to be as generous and kind-hearted as the Australians who trust us.\n\nMillions of Australians have waited long enough for this act of justice and inclusion.\n\nThe opportunity of a generation is before us now.\n\nThe moment is here.\n\nLet this law reflect the nation we want to see in the mirror: generous, smart, modern, diverse, honest and, above all, equal.\n\nLet’s switch on the light.\n\nLet’s make 2015, the year when Australia embraces marriage equality.\n\nLet’s make it happen, together.\n\nIt’s time",
