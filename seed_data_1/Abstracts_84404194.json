    "fullText": "Ethnic Studies Review 36:1-2 Abstracts Understanding the Nature and Effects of Police-Citizen Encounters in Social Context: A Road Less Traveled Alfred R. D' Anca College of Mount Saint Vincent Aggressive policing tactics have been identified as contributors to declining crime rate trends in urban, culturally diverse neighborhoods . They encompass stop and frisk practices which have spawned negative public opinion that contrasts with its justification by criminal justice officials as an effective means for the control and prevention of crime. The issue, however, begs deeper questions not readily addressed: how does the nature of police-citizen suspicion-based encounters influence the attitudes and behavior of both stakeholders ; and does it contribute to effective crime control and prevention? Based on an analysis of theoretical and empirical research in the field, this article argues that a sense of shame and perception of fairness or unfairness are endemic to face-to-face suspicion-based encounters between police officers and the public, and have significant implications for the experience of justice, control and prevention of crime, and policy initiatives to promote community safety . KEYWORDS : Justice; Shame; Fairness ;  Legitimacy; Crime Prevention; Crime Control Enacting \"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\" as Black Gay Print Culture Shawn Anthony Christian Wheaton College This essay offers a comparative analysis of the ways that Isaac Julien' s Looking for Langston ( 1 989) and Rodney Evans ' s  Brother to Brother (2005) inscribe Richard Bruce Nugent' s landmark short story \"Smoke, Lilies, and Jade\" ( 1 926) . Both films are examples of how \"Smoke,\" which was first published in the short-lived but infamous journal FIRE!!, now functions as much more than an artifact from the Harlem Renaissance' s  dynamic print culture. As I contend through this analysis, \"Smoke\" is a central diegetic element in both films . It enables Looking' s  visual depiction of the sojourn that Nugent' s protagonist Alex has with his male lover \"Beauty\" and Brother' s depiction of an intergenerational collaboration that honors Nugent as a black gay male artist. Through honorific interpretations of \"Smoke, Lilies ,  and Jade,\" Looking for Langston and Brother to Brother affirm a black gay print culture as indispensable to black gay film. Keywords: \"Smoke, Lilies ,  and Jade,\" Looking for Langston; Brother to Brother, Black gay print culture, Black gay film, Harlem Renaissance Closing the Gap: A Research Agenda for the Study of Health Needs among American IndianlNative Hawaiian Transgender Individuals Irene S Vernon Colorado State University Trudie Jackson University of Arizona Objectives :  To explore health research needs of American Indian and Native Hawaiian (AIINH) transgender individuals.  Methods : This qualitative study is composed of four focus groups and one informal meeting, totaling 42 AIINH transgender individuals in four major cities .  The theoretical and methodological approaches combined grounded theory with the principles of community based participatory research. Results :  Healthcare and resiliency are two main themes that emerged as research needs with important subcategories within them. Access to quality care from medical professionals and access to care that is unique to their trans gender status were subcategories within healthcare. Lived experiences, culture, and history were factors found to contribute to their resiliency. Conclusions:  There are a number of factors that lead to health disparities among AIINH people. They include the lack of quality care due to the negative encounters with health providers , health care providers ' limited knowledge of trans gender issues, and lack of transgender specific services. This must be researched further along with health provider care, attitudes ,  beliefs, and education. Understanding the lived lives of AIINH trans gender individuals and utilizing their culture and history in health interventions may improve their health and overall wellbeing.

Colbert, Kai M. Perry, and Marcia Anderson University of Connecticut This article explores case examples of two graduate students who endure microaggressions from their math professor at a predominantly White university. The role that parental socialization plays in how these students developed their racial identities and the coping strategies they employed, is analyzed through the lens of Triple Quandary theory (Boykin and Toms 1 985) .  Findings from this investigation suggest that parental socialization is critical in preparing these students to cope with and respond to microaggressions in protective and adaptive ways. This paper illuminates coping styles, although divergent, that served these graduate students' needs and protected their individual racial identities. Further, the support these students received from their faculty advisor who is also Black, exemplifies the importance of mentorship and advocacy from faculty of color to Black college students' success. Direction for continuity in parental teachings for K- 1 2  and university level educators are discussed. Keywords: microaggressions, Triple Quandry Theory, higher education, racism Discursive and Processual Socialization of the Mass into Acts of Violence: the Case of Rwandan Genocide Jeylan Wolyie Hussein Haramaya University, Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. This article analyses discursive and processual socialization of the masses into acts of violence during the Rwandan genocide of 1 994. The discursive aspects of the social izat ion include discourses of  dehumanization, ethnic extremism and the dynamics of  public socialization into violence and other acts of savagery. The processual dimension of the socialization refers to the violentization process. The article tries to show that the discursive and the processual aspects of socialization reinforced each other. It analyses the ideological and linguistic mechanisms mobilized in Rwanda to foment hatred and whip the masses into atrocities. The article, in addition, tries to explain the genocide through diverse social psychological theories and illustrate the interaction between the leaders' political agitation of the masses towards extermination and the perpetrators' action on the ground. The article argues that no single theory can fully explain the incomprehensible genocide since it was the result of a complex intermarriage between social, ideological and moral forces. It also examines the role of cultural and linguistic resources in the violentization process .  On the basis of the analysis, the article recommends what should be done to prevent similar atrocities in Africa. Keywords: genocide, Rwanda, discourses of dehumanization, violentization, Rutu, Tutsi Exploring the Dynamics of Identity Based Conflict and the Possibility for its Sustainable Management: A Study of the Persistent Ethno-Religious Conflict in Wukari Area of Taraba State, Nigeria Jude A. Momodu, G.I. Matudi, and Abiodun L. Momodu Federal University of Technology (now Modibbo Adama University of Technology) Y ola- Adamawa State, Nigeria This article explores the dynamics of identity-based conflict and the possibility for its management. The study in particular focuses on the persistent ethno-religious conflicts in the Wukari Area of Taraba State, Nigeria. The real issues precipitating the persistent ethno-religious conflicts and the costs of the conflicts were clearly brought to the fore. The study proposes a new paradigm for managing social conflicts at the community level through the 'use of community solutions for community problems ' which will involve the constructive participation of all of the stakeholders in the community. This paper concludes by making a proposal for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) and a power sharing arrangement as strategies that could bring about lasting peace between the Jukun Christians/ Traditionalist Jukun and the Jukun MuslimslHausa Muslims who are the warring parties in the persistent ethno-religious conflicts ravaging Wukari Local Government Area of Taraba State, Nigeria. Keywords: Identity Conflict, Ethno-Religious Conflict, Ethnicity, Religion, and Reconciliation Tribal-led People's Resistance in Transition: 1765-1800 Ananda Bhattacharyya West Bengal State Archives The year 1 799 A.D. is marked in the annals of Midnapore as the year of the great Chuar Rebellion when all the Adivasis,  Sirdars and paiks broke out in a rebellion. They wanted the restoration of their Jagir lands which the British had forcibly resumed earlier. It was a formidable resistance of the Adivasis against the colonial regime. The lawless tribes of the jungle mehal made common cause with the paiks and peasants and carried slaughter and flame to the very doors of the Magistrate' s  cutcherry . The plundered booty on some occasions was distributed among the ryots. The threat to burn the town and to plunder revenue was no doubt a form of anti-colonial resistance against the East India Company. Key Words: Chuar Rebellion, Adivasi Resistance, Jungle Mehal Trusting an Abusive System: Systemic Racism and Black Political Engagement Matthew Simmons Temple University Africana people in America have relied upon the utilization of political participation in order to address the economic and societal ills that plague its community. Africana people have made strides at all levels of the American government. Africana people were a vital voting block that helped to elect the first American President of African descent. However, studies have shown that the conditions of Africana people in America have not substantially changed since the Voting Rights Act of 1 965 was enacted. Africana political participation has not equated to socio­economic equality on a large scale for the Africana community. Utilizing Feagin 's  Systemic Racism Theory, this project looks to examine why solely relying upon the American political system is symptomatic of dis­agency for Africana people and argues that this dis-agency does not empower our people to seek solutions. It places the power to liberate in the oppressor' s hands, thus maintaining the inequality that continues to exist in America. This article also argues for Africana people to look to themselves as the avenue for addressing the societal ills that it faces. It also argues that Africana people must be their own mechanism for liberation. In addition, the terms Africana and Black will be used interchangeably in the project because those terms are most readily identifiable to people of African descent living in America.

Ella Baker was a prominent figure in the black freedom struggle. She was active in fighting for equal rights for Afrikans in America for over five decades. Her approach was characterized by an ability to mobilize and influence youth to action. In this work, there will be an analytical examination of how this methodology is equipped to stand the tests of time through what will be called The Fundi Effect. The Fundi Effect is a method of activism that is capable of being applied inter-generationally, and has the ability to address the reactionary manner with which injustice is dealt in attempts at social movements at present.
