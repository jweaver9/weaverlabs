Through in-depth narrative interviews, the 6 present study sought to understand the lived experiences of 11 LGBTQ+ undergraduates (Age 7 range = 19 – 23) building narrative identities in the cultural context of social media, and the 8 role of social media within this process. Interviews were analysed using an interpretative, 9 individual analysis of personal stories. These experiences were then compared and contrasted 10 through thematic analysis to identify four shared narrative themes. Narratives of merging safe 11 spaces highlight how LGBTQ+ youth now have regular access to safe environments 12 on/offline which facilitate more secure identity development. Narratives of external identity 13 alignment describe social media as a tool for LGBTQ+ youth to seek out identities that match 14 their pre-existing sense of self. Narratives of multiple context-based identities encapsulate 15 how adolescents’ identity markers are multiple and invoked in a context-dependent manner. 16 Lastly, narratives of individuality and autonomy characterise how LGBTQ+ youth perceive 17 themselves as highly individualised members of a wider community. These findings highlight 18 the complex role social media plays within LGBTQ+ youth identity development. The 19 implications are discussed within. 20  21 Keywords: Identity development, narrative identity, social media, sexuality, 22 adolescence, Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer Plus (LGBTQ+), queer 23  24 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   2  “Let me do what I please with it […] don't decide my identity for me”: LGBTQ+ youth 25 experiences of social media in narrative identity development. 26 Adolescence is a key developmental period for identity formation (Erikson, 1968; 27 McAdams, 2015). Defined as the transition from childhood to adulthood, it is characterised 28 by biological, cognitive, and social changes (Bell, 2016). In contemporary society, identity 29 development takes place over a prolonged period, now extending into the third decade of life 30 known as ‘emerging adulthood’ (Arnett, Zukauskiene, & Sugimura, 2014). A key feature of 31 identity development during this life stage is the emergence of the ability to construct a sense 32 of personal continuity over time and across contexts (Erickson, 1968; Pasupathi, Mansour, & 33 Brubaker, 2007). Narrative identity refers to an individual’s developing life story; 34 synthesising characters, plots, and events, and between self and society to bring an 35 overarching explanation and meaning to a string of potentially random life moments (Frank, 36 2000; McAdams & McLean, 2013; McLean et al, 2018). Sexual attraction and romantic 37 relationships are important elements of this identity development (Savin-Williams, 2005). 38 However, sociocultural expectations surrounding gender and relationships can be highly 39 complex, especially for those who experience same-sex attraction (DeVito, Walker, & 40 Birnholtz, 2018; Hammack, Thompson, & Pilecki, 2009).  41 Social media has become prominent within all aspects of adolescents’ daily lives and 42 also now plays an integral role in identity, social, and romantic relational development for 43 most adolescents (boyd, 2014; Davis & Weinstein, 2017). For Lesbian Gay Bisexual 44 Transgender Queer Plus (LGBTQ+) youth, social media plays a critical part in providing 45 opportunities to share stories of similar experiences, access sexuality-relevant information, 46 and experiment in the presentation of versions of one's self to the rest of the world (Duguay, 47 2016; Kuper & Mustanski, 2014). Thus social media provides LGBTQ+ youth with daily 48 access to a broader socio-cultural dialogue that may facilitate and influence their narrative 49 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   3  identity development. The present study aims to explore the narrative identity development of 50 contemporary LGBTQ+ youth, who are the first generation to have persistent access to social 51 media throughout their adolescence, and the role of social media within this process. 52 Importantly, the study adopts an inclusive perspective of LGBTQ+ youth, focusing on the 53 experiences of same-sex attracted youth who may or may not adopt conventional labelling 54 (e.g. homosexual) around sexuality, also known as queer youths, who have been 55 underrepresented in research examining social media and identity processes (Driver, 2007; 56 Mathers, Sumerau & Cragun, 2018; Randazzo, Farmer & Lamb, 2015), e.g. those who 57 identify as female as many previous studies have focused on male-identified queerness (e.g. 58 Heath & Goggin, 2009). By using person-centred narrative interviews to understand life 59 stories, we aim to develop an enhanced understanding of LGBTQ+ youths’ cumulative 60 experiences of developing a sense of identity within the digital age.  61 LGBTQ+ Youth and Identity Development 62 Sexual identity is an important, normative and expected aspect of identity 63 development (Tolman & McClelland, 2011). Though difficult to accurately measure, in early 64 and mid-adolescence, roughly 15% of youth experience a period of sexual questioning and 65 experimentation, reporting emotional and sexual attraction to genders they themselves 66 identify as (Carver, Egan, & Perry, 2004) and approximately 4-5% of youth (16-24) identify 67 as same-sex attracted (Office of National statistics, 2016). However, this does not accurately 68 capture the various sexual and gender identities individuals now project in contemporary 69 society. Coming out and the disclosure of one’s LGBTQ+ identity (rather than concealing it) 70 is important to psychological health (Solomon, McAbee, Asberg, & McGee, 2015). 71 Therefore, the ability to integrate sexual desire, sexual activity, sexual openness and the 72 ability to articulate sexual identity has particular positive outcomes and benefits for LGBTQ+ 73 individuals (Parent, Talley, Schwartz, & Hancock, 2015). However, this research often 74 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   4  focuses on ‘more traditional’ homonormative sexual identity descriptors such as ‘lesbian’ and 75 much less is known about queer youth (Driver, 2007; Mathers, Sumerau & Cragun, 2018; 76 Randazzo et al., 2015), who may identify ‘in-between’ these now established categorise. 77 LGBTQ+ youth have not always had the freedom to express their romantic and sexual 78 interests, and this is even more salient for less well understood subcategories such as 79 ‘pansexual’, ‘fluid’ or ‘mostly straight’(e.g. Randazzo et al., 2015). This process has often 80 been characterised by negative stereotypes, homophobia and victimisation (e.g. Pearson & 81 Wilkinson, 2013). Importantly, negative reactions by known individuals and the broader 82 community to disclosure can diminish its positive psychological effects (Mustanski, 83 Andrews, & Puckett, 2016). Furthermore, the cultural context for a new cohort of LGBTQ+ 84 youth has shifted dramatically in the twenty-first century (Cohler & Hammack, 2007), with 85 significant political and social gains towards equality (e.g. The U.K. Civil Partnership Act, 86 2004), and a dramatic increase in visibility of ‘alternative’ sexual identity within many areas 87 of the modern media (Raley & Luckas, 2006). However, many of these ‘alternative’ identities 88 are grouped into binary categories (e.g. homo- or heterosexual) and LGBTQ+ individuals 89 spend significant time and mental energy managing how these ongoing disclosure decisions 90 occurs (Manning, 2016). 91 LGBTQ+ Identity Management and Social Media 92 The emergence and widespread adoption of social media have further shifted the 93 sociocultural landscape for sexual identity development (Davis & Weinstein, 2017; Kuper & 94 Mustanski, 2014). Approximately 95% of 16-24-year-olds in the UK (Ofcom, 2018) and 96% 95 of 18-29-year-olds in the United states (Anderson, 2019) own a smartphone, with 96% of 96 smartphone users in western societies using the internet for social media use (Office of 97 National Statistics, 2017). These social media users actively engage in multiple digital 98 platforms, with Snapchat, Instagram and Youtube being the most popular among 18-24-year-99 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   5  olds (Perrin & Anderson, 2019). Current emerging adults or ‘Zillennials’, – born between 100 1995 and 2010 (Turner, 2015), are the first generation to have lived their entire adolescence 101 with immediate and personalised mobile access to social media which continually and 102 persistently accompanies them through all of the environments they inhabit in their daily life 103 activities. 104 Social media applications offer distinct new lines of identity exploration and 105 expression in a context largely disparate to that of previous generations (Lijadi & Schalkwyk, 106 2017). Scholars now argue online environments such as social media are a key functional 107 context for healthy developmental tasks related to identity development (boyd, 2014; 108 Haimson, 2018). They can offer a safe and accepting online environment (Craig & McInroy, 109 2014), ready access to information and social support (Baams, Jonas, Utz, Bos, & Van Der 110 Vuurst, 2011), the ability to connect with peers across geographic boundaries to identify 111 similar individuals to themselves and assist in identifying sexual partners not available offline 112 (Miller, 2015). This is particularly important for marginalised groups such as LGBTQ+ 113 individuals (Fox & Ralston, 2016). The anonymity and pseudonymity (e.g. exploration of 114 social media without evidence of visitation) the internet can provide, paired with the 115 disinhibition (Suler, 2004) and ubiquitous nature of daily public online communication 116 increase opportunities to experiment with unexplored aspects of the self, without risk of 117 stigma (Davis & Weinstein, 2017). As this exploration continues, social media can facilitate 118 controlled self-disclosure within the coming out process (Fox & Ralston, 2016), assisting 119 LGBTQ+ individuals in constructing, managing and expressing identity projections as they 120 shift over time. Adolescents now hold in their hand the ability to continually project self-121 expression, self-edit, reshuffle, revise and reorganise aspects of the self, which provide new 122 opportunity to learn from and influence a more diverse audience of others (Davis, 2012).  123 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   6  However, the complex daily decision-making challenges and how self-presentation 124 decisions are made in relation to their LGBTQ+ social media use also brings risks (DeVito et 125 al., 2018). Early online experiences were generally distinct from offline life, but as social 126 media use increases bridging the physical and digital, online identities have become more 127 consistent with offline selves (Davis & Weistein, 2017). DeVito et al., (2018) suggest that 128 due to social media use, identity presentation for adolescents is now complicated in ways that 129 are not captured by existing models of self-presentation. Adolescents are required to manage 130 the ongoing process of identity presentations both linearly across time, and latterly across 131 multiple often overlapping network profiles, with differing norms, expectations and 132 audiences (Perrin & Anderson, 2019). This process is made even more complex when 133 individuals do not fit neatly into well understood categories and can make the task of identity 134 self-definition and realignment even more complicated. It is of note that many popular social 135 media sites did not always allow users to define their own identity e.g. Facebook did not 136 expand its binary choice of gender options until 2014 (Bivens, 2017). DeVito et al., (2018) 137 reconceptualise these interactions in the form of a ‘Personal Social Media Ecosystem’ 138 highlighting the task of balancing a constantly shifting set of factors between personal, 139 structural and context-based decisions to avoid stigmatisation; while still allowing the need 140 for space particularly for LGBTQ+ individuals to experiment and express LGBTQ+ identity 141 safely. 142 However, for users who face high-stakes in their use of online presentation e.g. a gay 143 Christian in conservative midwestern united states (boyd, 2014), inadvertent disclosure of 144 LGBTQ+ identity can lead to potential harassment or employment discrimination (Birnholtz, 145 Fitzpatrick, Handel, & Brubaker, 2014). As individuals tailor behaviour for certain audiences 146 within a specific context (Goffman, 1959), many LGBTQ+ users continue to intentionally 147 and surgically separate their self-presentation, tailoring performance to specific segmented 148 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   7  contexts (DeVito et al., 2018; Duguay, 2016; Fox & Ralston, 2016). This is particularly 149 salient for those who have yet to, or partially transitioned in their identity realignment (e.g. 150 coming out). Indeed, the very notion of ‘coming out’ for many presumes an established 151 binary ‘end position’ e.g. redefinition from heterosexual to homosexual as a point of 152 completion or fulfilment of the process, but for some queer individuals that is not the case 153 (National Centre for Transgender Equality, 2018). The level of interactive and targeted 154 audience provided by social media now allows highly specific self-expression (Fox & 155 Ralston, 2016) in ways individuals were not able to previously experience.  156 However, the convergence of multiple disparate audiences within and across 157 platforms, and merging of off- and online identities, has meant it is increasingly difficult to 158 control the diverse audiences that may see specific social media identity presentations (boyd, 159 2014). This context collapse (boyd, 2011; 2014) - a non-intentional flattening of the spatial, 160 temporal and social boundaries that may otherwise separate audiences on social media - leads 161 to the risk of unintentional interactions between multiple identity presentations, and the 162 inadvertent disclosure of LGBTQ+ identity in non-supportive contexts can have highly 163 negative personal consequences (Birnholtz, Fitzpatrick, Handel, & Brubaker, 2014).  164 LGBTQ+ Youth and Narrative Identity 165 One framework which offers a structure to better understanding these often disparate 166 multiplicities of identity elements is through the lens of Narrative Identity development. 167 Whenever we tell stories which ‘explain’ ourselves to others, we are guided by ‘narrative 168 plots’, which express life stories that are far more complex than a simple catalogue of events 169 (Sarbin, 1986). These stories are constructed from pre-existing sociocultural templates or 170 master narratives (Cohler & Hammack, 2007; Hammack et al., 2009; McLean & Syed, 2015) 171 that individuals rely on to tell big or small tales of a human agent embedded in a social world 172 (Bamberg, 2006). The use of narrative, therefore, seems inherently connected to bringing 173 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   8  meaning to past experiences and the multiple identity presentations individuals exhibit on- 174 and offline to their different audiences. It offers a method for investigating how individuals, 175 within real contexts, attempt to synthesise multiple elements of identity presentation into a 176 workable construct of coherent identity. 177 Hammack et al. (2009) explored the whole life experiences of 18-25 year olds who, as 178 emerging adults, occupy an ‘in-between’ place characterised by attempts to make sense of the 179 struggles of childhood and adolescence while also considering the possibility of imagined 180 contexts of adult happiness. They argue that adolescent sexual identity development is 181 fundamentally tied to their construction of a personal narrative, which integrates desire and 182 behaviour into a meaningful and workable configuration in context. Combining previous 183 research on narrative identity development and LGBTQ+ youth, they highlight three integral 184 components of narrative identity development. The first is narrative engagement, which 185 denotes the need for individuals to participate actively in those narrative elements which 186 affect future choices or attitudes (Cohler & Hammack, 2007; Savin-Williams, 2005). 187 Secondly, such engagement leads to a process of identity configuration (Schachter, 2004) 188 which integrates the different core elements of an individual's experience that lead to a 189 workable identity (Hammack et al., 2009; Schachter, 2004). Thirdly, narratives function to 190 create a link between past, present and future through the identification of common life 191 themes or tasks (Habermas & Bluck, 2000; Pasupathi, Mansour, & Brubaker, 2007). This 192 narrative sense-making (Bruner, 1990) or meaning-making focuses on how individuals make 193 sense of their life experiences in relation to their own identity. This transpires most notably in 194 the form of turning points or critical moments when a realisation or significant life event 195 occurs (McAdams & McLean, 2013). These three components are particularly salient for 196 LGBTQ+ youth who must reconcile potentially conflicting experiences and configure 197 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   9  specifically individual elements of non-normative sexual attraction, behaviour, and broader 198 identity into a single overall sense of self (Hammack et al., 2009). 199 The examination of the dynamic identity formations of contemporary LGBTQ+ youth 200 would now seem incomplete without consideration of the contextual role social media plays 201 in that identity construction (Hammack et al., 2009). Individuals draw upon shared 202 underlaying sociocultural templates or master narratives (McLean & Syed, 2015) (that is the 203 stories communities tell about themselves) accessed through social media which assist in 204 composing expectations of how life will play out. This allows them to locate and story their 205 own life experiences within that identity negotiation, drawing upon shared narratives 206 accessed all around, and then offering their own identity projections and expectations to 207 others. If it is through the culture that we find the forms of storytelling, then social media 208 now seems to be the vehicle through which these merged personal and public narratives of 209 youth development are shared. 210 The Present Study 211 The present study explored the narrative identity development of contemporary 212 undergraduate LGBTQ+ youth, who are the first generation to have had persistent access to 213 social media throughout their adolescence. More specifically, it aimed to explore experiences 214 of contemporary LGBTQ+ youth (including queer youth with identities that do not conform 215 to traditional sexual orientations and may be underrepresented in research) building narrative 216 identities in the broader cultural multi-context of social media, with a particular focus on the 217 identity processes of narrative engagement, identity configuration and meaning-making. 218 Furthermore, the study adopts a person-centred narrative approach that aims to understand 219 the role of social media in the process of identity development. LGBTQ+ youth took part in 220 in-depth semi-structured narrative interviews. Data was analysed by first examining 221 individual narratives, then using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to identify shared 222 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   10  narratives themes across the pool of participant stories to understand the ways social media 223 informs and facilitates identity development.  224 Method 225 Participants and Procedures  226 Emerging adults were directly recruited from a small public university in an English 227 city-centre campus (Population: 6250, Female: 67.5%, Male: 32.5%, White, 91.2%, 228 Hertrosexual: 81.5%, LGB+ 9.6%, Cis: 93.5%, Trans: 2.7%; (York St John University, 2018) 229 through email advertisements across enrolled class lists (e.g. psychology, social science) and 230 university societies (e.g. Theatre, Music and the LGBTQ+ society). Participants were 231 recruited anonymously through an online appointment system and did not have to give their 232 details of their gender/sexual identity to be part of the study. The university has a reputation 233 for equality; it was ranked 24th  out of 434 organisations who took part in Stonewall’s 234 Workplace Equality Index (Stonewall, 2018) and the Students Union list sexual and gender 235 equality as a key policy priority. Our aim was to understand better the situated stories of 236 those who were ‘same-sex attracted’ (thus encompassing a broad definition of LGBTQ+ 237 youth). Purposeful sampling was used to obtain information-rich cases for study (Patton, 238 2002, p.230). Seventeen full-time undergraduate students (M = 20.29, SD = 1.40, Range = 239 19-23) participated in interviews. Participants defined themselves as a variety of sexual and 240 gender identities: 4 female bisexual (n = 4), 1 bisexual non-binary born female (n = 1), 2 241 female and 1 male pansexual/fluid/queer (n = 3), 2 female and 1 male homosexual (n = 3), 242 and 5 female and 1 male heterosexual (n = 6). As the purpose of the study was to understand 243 themes in LGBTQ+ youth identity narratives, the heterosexual participants who had clearly 244 misunderstood the recruitment call for “same-sex” attracted youth, were excluded from the 245 study. This exclusion occurred after data collection, as it was only during the interviews that 246 this became apparent. This exclusion enabled us to focus in detail on the shared narratives of 247 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   11  the LGBTQ+ youth and foreground their experiences. Participants were interviewed 248 individually in a neutral interview room on campus during April and May 2018. Interviews 249 lasted between 37 and 68 minutes with the average interview lasting approximately 55 250 minutes. The study received full ethical approval from the relevant ethics committee at York 251 St John University and adhered to the ethical guidelines established by the British 252 Psychological Society.  253 All participants used multiple social media every day. All participants expressed 254 relative levels of outness, but with varying degrees of how openly this was presented online 255 (e.g. ranging from ‘liking’ LGBTQ+ posts, to open relationship representations). Seven 256 explicitly mentioned some form of past or present religious affiliations (5 Christian, 2 257 Spiritual/New-Age). All participants identified  as being from a low or medium 258 socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, though reported a mixture of city, town and rural 259 upbringings prior to joining university. The majority identified as Caucasian (n = 10) which 260 is representative of the local geographic area (86% Caucasian; Office of National Statistics, 261 2011). 262 Interview Guide and Procedure 263 Semi-structured interviews were employed by the first author to offer a focused yet 264 flexible exploration of how youths’ personal life story and culture come together in narrative 265 (McAdams, 2015). Key questions based on the McAdams life story interview (2008) where 266 adapted to focus on what role social media played in the enactment of their identity 267 presentation (Hammack et al., 2009). Interviews were participant led, enabling them to focus 268 on what they considered most important, identifying critical elements (Riessman, 2008) 269 which highlight moments participants considered significant in the development of their 270 identity (narrative engagement) such as dealing with a family members death (e.g. Ricoeur, 271 1983/1984). They were also asked to identify turning points (McAdams, 2006) that had 272 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   12  required participants to understand/negotiate/express their e.g. same-sex desire, behaviour 273 and identity and integrate them into the general life story (identity configuration) and how 274 participants made sense of these lived experiences (meaning-making) (e.g. McAdams, 2006; 275 McAdams & McLean, 2013; Pasupathi et al. 2007) offline and on social media. Many of the 276 questions were explicitly focused on social media and were mapped to narrative identity 277 elements. For example, “Can you tell me about a time when using social media in relation to 278 your sexual identity made a significant impact to your life?”. The interviewer also played a 279 key role in deliberately using probing follow-up questions to explore these stories in detail. 280 The interviews were transcribed verbatim by the principal researcher from audio recordings.  281 Narrative Analytic Strategy  282 Participants’ narrative interviews were initially examined individually, allowing a 283 holistic examination of personal stories (e.g. Kuper & Mustanski, 2014). A narrative thematic 284 analysis (Riessman, 2008) was employed as its primary focus is on the story itself as the unit 285 of analysis (the content of the data is what is said). Firstly, memos and initial observations 286 were noted throughout transcription, taking a critical self-reflective approach (Riessman, 287 2008) in the form of open coding. Possible within-person critical elements that created a 288 behavioural renegotiation of their identity were labelled, which could come in many forms 289 (e.g. significant experiences of bullying). Relevant text was identified and then possible 290 narrative coding themes were built around these.  291 After individual stories had been examined by the lead researcher, a reflexive 292 thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006; 2019) was employed to identify similar prominent 293 codes across participant’s stories. All coding (both within and between participants’ stories) 294 was performed by the first author, with the second and third author providing support and 295 guidance by looking at a small subset (two transcripts). This approach is consistent with 296 Braun and Clarke who advocate one author performing all coding (Braun & Clarke, 2019). 297 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   13  Themes where then created that link together common and contrasting elements to form a 298 pattern of narrative identity development among participants, in an iterative manner through 299 discussion between authors. After identifying these common and contrasting narrative themes 300 (Frank, 2000), experiences were contextualised in relation to the broader sociocultural 301 context. Particular attention was paid to how individuals felt they held agency and voice 302 through their use of social media, and how this interacts with social context in mutually 303 impactful ways, connecting their individual meanings to “more global assumptions and 304 worldviews held by individuals within the culture under study” (Riessman, 1993, p. 61).  305 As qualitative research is co-created in nature (Riessman, 2008), the authors position 306 requires identification as this will have had some effect on the participants’ choice of shared 307 stories (Riessman, 2008), his role in identifying, synthesising and selecting narratives, and 308 then reporting them to the reader (Josselson, 2011). The primary researcher who performed 309 the interviews and initial analysis (with input from two co-authors who also looked over 310 coded interviews and discussed coding and themes) is a white male in his early 40’s, self-311 described as ideologically liberal, and has worked in UK Secondary Schools (11-19-year-312 olds) teaching Sex Education, Psychology, and Religious Studies for 17 years. His motivation 313 for study was routed in multiple students who had come to seek counsel on issues related to 314 complex sexual and gender-related issues in the past, and as a cisgender heterosexual white 315 male, wished to understand the lived experience of LGBTQ+ youth better and assist other 316 allies in future support. To ensure the validity of the research’s interpretation of these 317 findings, after the report was produced, the analysis was verified by independently checking 318 themes against the original recordings and transcripts (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The results 319 and discussion section of the report were then shared with a sample of participants as a form 320 of member-checking, who were asked to indicate the extent to which the report reflected their 321 own experiences and that of their contemporaries. The participants suggested minimal 322 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   14  revisions indicating that the findings did arcuately reflect their experiences, and the quotes 323 used had not been misrepresented.  324 Results 325 Across the dataset, four inter-related narrative themes (with sub-themes) were 326 developed that encapsulate LGBTQ+ youths’ experiences of social media during the process 327 of narrative identity development: (1) Narratives of merging safe spaces which highlight 328 regular access to safe spaces on/offline which facilitate more stable identity development; (2) 329 Narratives of external identity alignment, illustrating a desire to be known for ‘Who I already 330 am’; (3) Narratives of multiple context-based identities, identifying a rejection of a single 331 sexuality-based core identity; and (4) Narratives of individuality and autonomy which outline 332 highly individualised members of a community. Names and place names have been 333 anonymised to preserve the anonymity of participants.  334 1. Narratives of Merging Safe Spaces Off/Online 335 1.1 Safe spaces facilitate stable identity development. Participants’ stories of 336 forming identity projections that reflected aspects of their sexual identity highlighted how 337 engagement in such projections was only possible when they felt safe. These projections 338 were important aspects of their story as they ultimately led to a more secure sense of identity. 339 All participants reported regular and easy access to contexts for safe and open expression in 340 their present experiences, feeling ‘safe and accepted’ as LGBTQ+ youth in nearly all 341 situations on- and offline. When Sharron reflected on the theatre production group she is part 342 of, she notes regular and positive expressions of support:  343 … I think a lot of people like weren't out at the start of the year, and throughout the 344 year it's sort of [I: Mmm] come out that people are gay or bi or trans or whatever 345 because I think people, people realised that they would be accepted no matter what 346 (Sharron, 19, bisexual) 347  348  She highlights a common story told by participants - that the social environment on- 349 and offline now affords security when expressing non-normative identity across 350 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   15  environmental contexts. It did not mean others claimed to understand their exact sexual or 351 gender identity, but there was an acceptance that their expression of a ‘differing’ identity 352 would not diminish their friendships. One of the critical turning points shared by many 353 participants is that of their coming out stories, which straddled the on- and offline world. 354 Although on balance these were all positive experiences, stories varied in format, and even in 355 homes where individuals’ felt safe and accepted, some participants expressed apprehension. 356 Sarah who has experienced significant friendship rejection in the past, remembers having ‘no 357 issues’ when coming out to parents, but possibly due to internalised stigmas (evidenced in 358 past research examining master narratives such as struggle and success e.g. Savin-Williams, 359 2005) and past experiences she: 360 … refused to tell my dad, I made my mum tell my dad [because he] grew up with a 361 religious background and he never ever ever said anything against it, like anything 362 like that, but it was just one of those things I just couldn’t face doing it. I was like I 363 can’t, I can’t tell him. It’s really funny because he ends up off sick from work the next 364 day, and I was at home because I had no classes on, and I was like for god sake, so it 365 was just me and my dad and we just like made lunch, and it was like really awkward, 366 and we ate lunch and he just stood up and just went ‘give me a hug, I don’t care as 367 long as you’re happy’ and I started crying, and I just remember my dad was like ‘why 368 are you crying’ and I was just like ‘I’m just really happy’. (Sarah, 19, Bisexual) 369  370 Although occasionally experiencing initial fears of rejection, many felt their 371 relationships had been enriched by sharing sexual or gender identity transitions even if only 372 in a developing form with family members, leading to a more positive sense of self. 373 1.2 Social media is a safe space. Participants’ stories of safety and acceptance had 374 translated from ‘safe’ online environments into participants’ offline contexts. In line with 375 previous research (e.g. Duguay, 2016), online is largely a safe space for many LGBTQ+ 376 youths. Xander, the oldest participant, who identifies as queer and uses the pronoun ‘he’, was 377 bullied offline for much of his early childhood. Here, he reflects on his experience before 378 accessing social media: 379 In terms of forming identity I think it's good, because there are lots and lots of people 380 putting their own experiences forward, and that makes room for validation and self-381 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   16  discovery, and I think, you know, 11-year-old me wouldn’t have gone through that oh 382 my god everyone around me’s straight, and I'm gay, if I had social media because I 383 would have seen there were more people out there. (Xander, 23, Queer) 384  385 Feeling safe and accepted within social media environments often stemmed from the 386 sharing of similar experiences with others, many of whom were not known to participants in 387 the offline world but offer a space to explore their non-normative, but still developing 388 identity and allows an opening of a dialogue (both intra and interpersonally) about how they 389 may go about defining this difference in identity. Sarah remembers the first time she shared 390 her potential LGBTQ+ identity with a friend she considers close, but has never met offline: 391 No, never met her [I: right, OK], no, a lot, a lot of these people I haven’t met, erm and I 392 think, I think, I can’t remember what it was, I think my friend, one of my other friends, 393 she just, she just come out as gay, and I was like ‘I don't know how to handle this cause 394 I was, cause I like, I feel exactly the same as she does, but I’m like I don't really know 395 how to talk about it [I: right] because it was never, no one ever talked about us where I 396 was from, I didn't think I knew anybody [I: hmmm] at that point, [I: yeah] that I knew 397 of anyway.  398  399 Participants reported experiencing safety in social media environments due to privacy 400 settings. This allowed participants to express identity as privately or as publicly as they 401 wished. Paul/a who had a positive critical turning point during a counselling session, recounts 402 their decision to start subtly shifting the information their family has access to: 403 ... you can set posts that people, not everyone, can see [I: Yeah] so I have like, er, 404 certain style of post which pretty much all the adults in my family life, they are just 405 blocked from seeing certain posts [I: Yeah] that I post, and those are normally the 406 ones that are about gender and identity and sexuality and stuff like that, I've started 407 kinda of, kinda, creeping into showing them more stuff [I: Yeah] cause if I don't have 408 to come out to them, and they just know, that's so much easier [I: laugh], If my 409 grandma came to me and was like, are you, are you not… a girl, are you not straight, 410 I’d be like no, I’m not, and that would be so much easier than to sit her down… 411 (Paul/a, 20, Nonbinary bisexual born female) 412  413 This seems to identify a dual function for participants, offering both a level of security 414 and control which gives the participants the ability to choose how, when and with whom they 415 will express their LGBTQ+ identity, allowing more gradual and nuanced coming out 416 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   17  experiences; but also initiates potentially ‘difficult’ conversations with older relatives 417 controlled by the participant. 418 2. Narratives of external identity alignment 419 2.1 ‘Who I already am’ drives meaning-making. In nine interviews, participants 420 expressed a desire to be known for ‘who I already am'. This desire to align the inner self with 421 external self-presentation seemingly drives meaning-making for LGBTQ+ youths. A critical 422 aspect of most identity narratives related to the process of self-definition. Participants, like 423 Sandy described past experiences of searching to find identity labels that matched what was 424 already inside: 425 I was like maybe I’m nothing [laugh], so I went through that for like 2 years, then I 426 got to Middle School which is like, 12, 13, and I was like ‘hmm maybe I'm bi’ [I: 427 Yeah], that didn't work either [I: laugh] so I'm trying all these things, and then, 428 recently when I got to uni I thought, I’m probably pansexual, cause that, it, I was 429 struggling with like, the boundaries [I: Yeah], because I understand the necessity like, 430 of labels but that also wasn't working, [I: Yeah] so I've just started saying that I’m 431 queer [P/I: laugh] which covers everything, but not to say that I am everything, it just 432 covers all grounds, because it's just people at the end of the day. (Sandy, 19, Queer) 433  434 Sandy’s story highlights a common dissatisfaction that labels, even many found 435 already within the LGBTQ+ community, do not fit pre-existing selves. This desire to be 436 known externally for who they really are influenced online self-presentations. Though online 437 presentations did not have to completely align with internal identity, most acknowledged that 438 their social media presentations were now close proximities to their perceived self. When 439 Xander considered his self-presentation, he noted that social media offers the ability to 440 transcend physical restraints: 441 I think they are close, but, also, not at all at the same time, because they are, it is a, 442 erm, cherry-picked version of yourself you know, you're putting, my own twitter 443 tends to be consistently positive and productive updates, and it's not, I, a long time 444 ago steered away from posting kind of moany things or like, oh I've had the worst day 445 or whatever, that kind of stuff, unless I felt it was contributing to a necessary 446 conversation 447  448 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   18  None of the participants used social media to create an entirely different persona online. 449 Instead social media was used to facilitate self-presentations that were true to their inner 450 selves. There was a shared understanding that social media enabled a ‘cherry-picked’ 451 presentation that could be used as an opportunity to safely project their inner self, or desired 452 ideal self, to an external audience. Identity relevant information could be released over time, 453 first segmented using social media, then slowly opening privacy settings to reveal an identity 454 projection shift to a broader audience. This could entail posting subtle pictures with a same-455 sex partner, or attraction-based commentary first on- and then offline possibly to avoid 456 context collapse by pre-empting unintentional information leakage (boyd, 2011, 2014). For 457 instance Paul/a described recently using social media more to disclose their LGBTQ+ 458 identity: 459 … the trans awareness video, I posted that on my Facebook without putting the 460 blacklist on [I: Yeah] so that was kind of like, my caption also kind of implied that I 461 was non-binary, though obviously, the video says it explicitly, so I'm gonna post this, 462 and see if anyone comments on it… And I think a couple of like my aunts or something 463 did like it, so I'm like, ok so cool, so they know… but erm, my grandparents didn’t 464 mention it, but like, I kind of want to start… doing that more and I feel like social 465 media is… helpful for that, because I’m a bit naff at like talking about serious things 466 face-to-face. 467  468 2.2 Terminology and labels. Terminology and ‘labels’ were both loved and loathed by 469 participants, and were key stories in all interviews. Tim, who has several long-term mental 470 health issues, described social media as a very positive device for self-understanding and 471 meaningful interaction: 472 I’m a huge fan of labels… there’s plenty of people within the LGBT community that 473 say oh let’s do away with labels and be, you know like, be that kind of thing. I'm not of 474 that opinion; I am of the opinion that I need, an identifier, I can't just say I'm me 475 because that's too broad… I can say I'm me, and me constitutes these different 476 characteristics […] social media is good for identifying labels because there are boxes 477 to fill in that says, gender, pronouns, sexuality, that kind of thing, you can use social 478 media to give that list of who you are, that kind of, you know, slightly more publicly 479 identify… (Tim, 23, Homosexual) 480       481 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   19   For Tim, who identifies as a well-understood term in contemporary society, labels give 482 a framework to understand himself and bring a name to his internalised state. Labels also 483 helped him to better contextualise his relationship with others, allowing him to understand 484 who he is in relation to others and be a ‘better friend’. However, other participants found 485 labels could be complex, problematic and misleading. For example, Polly when defining her 486 own identity said: 487 … generally, I'd say bisexual, but I prefer pansexual, but people don't know what that 488 is and think you're doing weird things to woks… I think I don't… I've never really 489 like been like specifically attracted to one gender; it's kind of the person… And I'm 490 not a big fan of labels as they are quite restrictive […] having one word you can use 491 to get across something that can be quite complicated […] that's when it causes 492 problems, because everyone's got a different idea and it's so personal that people get 493 quite defensive when they disagree (Polly, 19, Pansexual) 494  495 Polly suggests there are many ways to conceptualise both sexuality and gender, and it 496 is unnecessarily limiting to express sexual attraction in the narrow way labels provide. This 497 need for customisable terminology was an underlying theme in most interviews, but was 498 most evident when interviewing those that identified as ‘non-binary’, ‘pansexual’, ‘fluid’ or 499 ‘queer’. When asked if ‘queer’ was a useful label, Xander replied: 500 I'm not sure, I think because queer used to be such a vitriolic word I know that a lot of 501 people struggle with it, people still hear it as a slur, so they don't want to identify as it, 502 erm, for me, it's more just like an umbrella of, like a… a straying away from labels 503 even though it is essentially a label in itself, it's a label to kind of cover everything... 504 Its identifying as something without tying it down its… Yeah, erm, I think it's 505 difficult because its, we talk about identity through labels [I: Yeah] and when you’re 506 the sort of person who identifies away from labels, there’s, it’s really hard to 507 communicate that because so often people want to know what’s your sexuality, 508 what’s your gender identity… 509  510 He identifies as ‘queer’ to express a fluid identity, which for him means he could 511 identify as multiple or differing genders and be attracted to individuals who identify in ways 512 that change day-to-day and reach beyond the simplistic male-female binary. Like Polly, he 513 consciously holds the tension of acknowledging the need to identify in some way and the 514 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   20  importance in denoting some non-normative state, while rejecting labels due to their 515 imperfect nature.  516 3. Narratives of multiple context-based identities 517 Non-normative sexuality was perceived as a core identity status for participants when 518 first acknowledging their internal sexual desires, and again when transitioning to their use of 519 external labels with others. However, after this initial period, these became only one of 520 several key identity markers. Tim clearly articulated this when expressing his identity as a 521 ‘gay, male, recovering Christian, geek’. When asked to explain what he meant, he said: 522 Mostly in the past it depends what takes precedence, erm, so, so so at the moment, like, 523 gay is the pri, is my primary identifier at the moment because erm, I just co, come out 524 of a relationship looking at other guys you know, so my head is in that kind of mode. 525 Whereas a couple of weekends ago, erm, er, when we had the [Club society night], I 526 was in geek mode [I: Yeah] and that was my overriding identifier… its probably more 527 the context, if something's going on that's... driving one particularly area of my identity 528 [… but] if I could only pick one [I: Mmm], it would have to be geek. 529  530  Not only does Tim identify multiple overt identities which he shares across off and 531 online audiences, but also comments on a hierarchy of identity statuses, which shifts in 532 different contexts. Many participants reported that they felt LGBTQ+ identity was now 533 accepted and ‘normal’ across audiences on and offline to their family and friend. Although it 534 was still an important identity marker, it did not necessarily merit special attention and they 535 did not purposefully compartmentalise these multiple identity projections online. Paul/a 536 highlighted that sexuality, and gender, are so normalised in their mind that, similarly to Tim, 537 context on and offline often drives their consideration of identity:  538 I think at the moment, like, when I was younger, you know, the last few years I think 539 my identity gender and sexuality wise was really important, and it was kinda 540 something I was very out and loud and proud for a lot of time, but I’m, over the last 541 you know, year or so, I’ve kind of mellowed out a lot about it a lot [I: Yeah] it’s just 542 kind of, I want people to know just so that they, you know understand and respect me 543 and then I don’t have to come up with a billion questions, but… I think now I'm older 544 it’s kind of yea, I want other people to see other parts of me whilst also still 545 understand that this, this major part of my identity you know [I: Yeah] my gender, it's 546 as important to me as someone else's is like, men can be very territorial about you 547 know their own masculinity, women are very like, I’m a women this is what I am, 548 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   21  and, you know I feel the same way about mine, it’s just other people think that, there 549 must be more emphasis on it because, it’s kinda divergent from the you know, the 550 norm  551  552 For participants, living within a sociocultural space that is now largely accepting of LGBTQ+ 553 identities meant the need to pay sexuality or gender more attention than other aspects of 554 identity was lessened. When Xander was asked if sexuality was prioritised in his identity 555 development, he responded:  556 It’s really not, I think the experiences related to growing up with the queer sexual 557 identity, those are important, erm, because they form aspects of your personality [I: 558 Yeah] and how you treat people, but it’s, the label itself is, I mean I’m not interested 559 in it at all, that’s why I identify as queer as [I: Yeah] I just think, and I actually get 560 quite frustrated when it’s the first thing people see or talk about, you know, erm, like 561 when you’re the gay best friend or whatever for instance [I: laugh] erm, that’s 562 frustrating as it’s very very reductive [I: Yeah], and really, it doesn't actually say 563 anything about a person – their sexuality, erm, beyond what they want to say [I: 564 Yeah] but people make an awful lot of assumptions when it comes to labels  565  566 Though presenting as the significant core identity when first coming out, this over 567 simplified view of their sexuality becomes only one of several defining identity markers over 568 time (even for those with less familiar identities e.g. queer) and participants aim is often to 569 open these differing identity contexts for others to better understand them.  570 4. Narratives of individuality and autonomy 571 4.1 A community of individual experiences. Stories of individuality within 572 community were shared by many participants. Ownership of highly personalised identity 573 labels unique to each individual was felt to conflict with membership of a broader group 574 identity at times, and the validity of other interpretations of the same labels. Xander describes 575 how his personal identity is balanced with a communal understanding of being LGBTQ+: 576 People just tend to assume an awful lot, and it's like, like, cause I was actually gonna 577 write about this, about being in a post coming out society, whereas beforehand, you 578 had to come out and tell people for them to know, which people still do, but then now 579 it seems more there's that much kind of awareness of different sexualities, you almost 580 have to say, no, come out twice like people will come, make you come out because 581 they'll assume what your sexuality is, and then you have to come out again and say 582 actually no, that's not, I am coming out but not in the way you think I am. 583  584 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   22  His experience of what he calls a ‘post-coming-out’ culture is one where people 585 accept non-normative sexuality, but immediately attempt to categorise what they perceive 586 that non-normative sexuality to be. This removal of personal autonomy over his identity 587 status is difficult, as although we may all present with a multiplicity of identities, his identity 588 is itself a fluid process that shifts across time and context on a daily basis. Xander continues: 589 I’d explain how fluid identity is, and how it’s not, you know [I: Yeah] erm, so rigid, 590 cause I think there’s this understanding that if you’re not one thing, you are the other, 591 like it, you have to fit somewhere and if you don’t fit somewhere then your feelings 592 aren’t real [we need] to stop thinking in umbrella generalised terms, cause what it 593 means, because even if you choose a specific label, for like gay, what it means to be 594 gay for one person is completely different for another person [I: Yeah] and there is 595 such diversity in that  596  597 He acknowledged now living in a society where confrontation of heteronormative 598 stereotypes is less necessary, and one can establish oneself as different. However, he noted 599 that care must still be taken even within the LGBTQ+ community to respect the dynamic 600 evolving differences between individuals as identities intersect in multiple and varying ways. 601 This was a view shared by others, as Polly noted:  602 I learned about non-binary, gender fluid and, like grey gender and agender, not that 603 it’s, if you’re trying to be inclusive as an LGBT community you can't, exclude 604 someone from your field of eligible just because they don't match up with a binary 605 identity, so this group of individuals is possibly a better way to look at this 606 community now. 607  608 Inclusion by difference seems both a complex but imperative community task for 609 LGBTQ+ youth, who are often grouped together due to difference. This was also evident in 610 participants’ discussion of high-profile LGBTQ+ individuals. Paul/a, a self-professed movie 611 buff, highlighted how famous LGBTQ+ role models could help some people to understand 612 their identity choices, but was not helpful to them (Paul/a) because they (Paul/a) did not feel 613 these fully represented their (Paul/a’s) personalised identity: 614 …it’s hard for me to explain to other people so… I know a lot of people who are 615 trans, who since you know, erm, Caitlin Jenner, and Laverne Cox and all these [I: 616 Hmm] icons kind of [I: Yeah] became public about being trans, they found it much 617 easier to come out as trans because they had these cultural pinpoints that they could 618 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   23  say to their parents, like [I: Yeah], I am like this [I: Yeah], where I feel with non-619 binary and even still bisexuality its… there's a lot less representation, so it's a lot 620 harder to be, there's no one person that I can be like, oh grandma – I'm like this.  621  622 4.2 Social media and autonomy. Permeating through all interviews, was the 623 participant’s desire for autonomy and control over their own personalised labels. Participants 624 reported that social media offers a space unconstrained by physical appearance or social 625 interaction difficulties, in which they had explored identity labels as part of a desire to match 626 these to pre-existing internalised concepts (See narratives of external identity alignment). 627 The ability to choose more accurate personal expressions when pre-existing labels did not 628 match internalised self-concept was a critical factor for Paul/a who remembers first seeking 629 out new ways to better express their shifting sense of identity online:  630 I saw trans first, I kinda saw that and I tried, I dabbled in it for a little bit, and I was 631 like, owww, this still doesn't fit, erm, but then at one point I saw the phrase non-632 binary and I was like, Oh! There we go, that's it! It’s just this in the middle thing… 633 erm of not really aligning yourself to any specific gender, just kinda being this 634 weird… purple thing [I: Laughs] in the middle [because…] if boy is blue and [I: 635 Yeah] girl is pink, er reddish, then non-binary is kinda this entire gradient of purple 636  637 Many participants narrate the positive function of social media which allows new 638 expressions of identity projections and offers space to disseminate them to others. When 639 considering how people share their identity on and offline today, Sarah observes: 640 …similar to like pronouns, you use the pronouns that people ask you to use, you use 641 the names that people ask you to use, if they ask you not to use a name, you don't use 642 that name [I: yeah], and I think that's, that's really important and it's, it's not even 643 about acceptance, it's about like tolerance and like, just, decency, like com, it's like 644 common [I: yeah] decency to use the name that people want you to use… sometimes I 645 will say lesbian or something like I'm gay, like, sometimes I will say that, and it's like 646 one of those things where it's like my identity let me do what I please with it but don't 647 like, don't decide my identity [I: hmmm] for me 648  649 Through autonomous ownership of a self-defined personal identity, participants were 650 able to project a coherent internalised self, but with multiple identity presentations, which co-651 exist to the world. By providing participants with exposure to a multiplicity of labels as well 652 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   24  as the facility to self-designate identity labels, social media was confirmed as integral to a 653 contemporary experience of this process. 654 Discussion 655 The present study aimed to understand the experiences of contemporary LGBTQ+ 656 youth building narrative identities in the broader cultural context of social media, and the role 657 of social media within this. A narrative thematic analysis was employed, which first focused 658 on individual participants’ life stories, and then compared and contrasted them across 659 participants, leading to the identification of four key themes within narratives: (1) Narratives 660 of merging safe spaces, (2) Narratives of external identity alignment, (3) Narratives of 661 multiple context-based identities, and (4) Narratives of individuality and autonomy.  662 Narratives of merging Safe Spaces 663 Participants’ stories were consistent with previous research (e.g. Fox & Ralston, 664 2016) highlighting online experiences as safe spaces that perform multiple beneficial 665 functions (e.g. access to networks for specific information) in relation to identity 666 development. Participants such as Paul/a and Polly saw benefit in the use of multiple social 667 media sites to compartmentalise information (such as Facebook) when performing specific 668 identity tasks dependent on the audience (Fox & Ralston, 2016). This was particularly 669 valuable during early identity exploration and transition work (Haimson, 2018), enabling 670 adolescents to perform various types of identity work safely in ways not previously available.  671 Though past research has focused on this hiding or compartmentalisation of 672 information for specific audiences (e.g. Devito et al., 2018), our participants' narratives 673 centred around projections of identity which were still multiple but purposely made more 674 open to audiences. Participants attributed feelings of safety online with a decision to open 675 contexts (across online platforms and offline) which portrayed a more authentic form of 676 identity presentation. Rather than pursuing identity presentation that were segmented across 677 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   25  different on and offline contexts, participants described experiencing identity development in 678 a cultural environment that seems largely accepting of non-normative sexuality and gender. 679 The increasing cultural normalisation of LGBTQ+ identities meant previous stigma and 680 templates of how ‘normal’ life will play out (i.e., master narratives of struggle and success 681 e.g. Savin-Williams, 2005) were significantly weakened and no longer seen as inevitable or 682 expected for our participants. That is not to say that participants did not face negativity on 683 and offline. Certain online platforms were still favoured for certain tasks, and there was an 684 acknowledgement by participants that some platforms such as Tumblr were more ‘queer’ 685 friendly than others. However, for our participants, these different tasks were not usually 686 segmented from view to a wider audience. For instance, Polly told a story of friends from her 687 childhood who had come across projections of her sexual shifting identity on Facebook (not 688 an expected platform for such information within some studies) and they had responded 689 negatively on her profile. Multiple allies rapidly responded in her defence, and this like many 690 of our participants only heightened their expectation that they had the right to express their 691 identity within and across any form of social media they desired.  692 Narratives of External Identity Alignment 693 The internal desire to be known for ‘Who I already am’ seemed to drive narrative 694 engagement and meaning-making for LGBTQ+ youth. Stories told by Sandy, Xander and 695 Tim included an early realisation that their internalised self-concept did not match their 696 external presentation. Acknowledgement of an internalised dissonance between who 697 participants perceived themselves to be and how others perceived them on and offline was 698 catalysed through critical moments (e.g. counselling) and turning points. This promoted new 699 levels of narrative engagement, encouraging participants to reconsider and re-story past 700 experiences, as they sought alignment of their internal perception(s) with their external 701 presentation of self. As Xander and Sandy’s stories illustrate, this search for terms and labels 702 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   26  to match pre-existing internal self-concepts is not merely the exploration or trying on of new 703 versions of self, but rather an active reconfiguration and ownership of labels as a result of an 704 already internalised, if still developing state.  705 This is an important reframing. Previous research suggests youth experiment with 706 different identities and then choose one (e.g. Hillier & Harrison, 2007) including on social 707 media. However, in our study, youths expressed a desire to change external identity 708 presentations when they felt their internal sense of who they already are did not match their 709 external presentation to others. Disconnections between internalised identity and external 710 presentation or ‘identity gaps’ (Faulkner & Hecht, 2011), led to attempts to balance out 711 disparities, initiating the process of narrative engagement that ultimately led to a more 712 successful shift in identity configuration and thus overall sense of self through meaning-713 making. Social media was positioned as a powerful tool in the bridging of these identity gaps 714 by providing LGBTQ+ youth with the facility to explore and engage in the creation of 715 identity presentations and shared narratives which reflect their present but shifting 716 experiences even if they did not fit within conventional LGBTQ+ identity categories (e.g. 717 Xander and Paul/a). This echoes Haimson’s (2018) Social Transition Machinery theory 718 which suggests the identity realignment youth experience on social media should be 719 reconceptualised as a new rite of passage. By enabling the projection of multiple identities 720 simultaneously, adolescents and emerging adults are able to present in different ways in 721 different contexts and this significantly assists in disclosure choices over time and in differing 722 environments. For example, participants echoed previous findings that Tumblr is often used 723 more for exploration and experimentation, while Facebook is employed for more formal 724 identity transition disclosure (Haimson, 2018). Furthermore, our findings extend this work, 725 suggesting the aim for our participants was to eventually open up these multiple and differing 726 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   27  identity presentations online in conjunction with offline identity presentations to offer a more 727 authentic if sometimes contradictory projection of identity across contexts. 728 Narratives of Multiple Context-Based Identities  729 Consistent with past research, participants expressed acceptance of the overlapping 730 interconnected nature of social media, and the complex task of managing a changing identity 731 presentation with a potentially permanent disparate lifetime digital footprint (Davis & 732 Weinstien, 2017). Though fragmentation and context compartmentalisation were described as 733 helpful in the early stages of identity development, audience segmentation was much less 734 prevalent in participants’ stories than has been previously documented (e.g. DeVito et al., 735 2018; Haimson, 2018). Participants such as Xander highlighted the tension between the 736 permanence of many social media channels such as Instagram that encourage socially 737 desirable presentations, and an acceptance by contemporary LGBTQ+ youth that it was still 738 important to express changing, disparate and momentary identity projections that may not 739 necessarily reflect their preferred overarching identity. Some participants outlined a move 740 towards ephemeral social media such as Snapchat, which provide low stake ways to express 741 in-the-moment identity projections (Davis & Weinstien, 2017). However, many of our 742 participants now in emerging adulthood found this segmentation, along with the use of 743 multiple accounts (e.g. Finstagram) as ‘trying too hard’ and was almost seen as a childlike 744 response by some of our participants. Most instead perceived themselves as a bundle of 745 different identities portrayed over time and across contexts. These were not hidden or 746 segmented for particular audiences, but rather participants expressed an expectation of the 747 right to openly portray shifting multiple identity projections simultaneously, while still 748 synthesising an overall identity.  749 Participants narrated a comfortableness with this view of identity presentation and 750 emphasised the opportunities the internet provides for actively crafting and expressing their 751 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   28  multidimensional identity projections, and then chose key identifiers to drive interactions 752 dependent to context (Weststrate & McLean, 2010). Participants told stories in which 753 sexuality was only one of several identity markers. For example, Tim primarily chose to 754 identify as 'geek' before any traditional sexual designation, but acknowledged how identity 755 projections interact in multiple ways, e.g. His favourite shows also featured pro-756 sexual/gender diversity characters such as DC’s The Flash or Supergirl.  757 As the interconnected nature of social media platforms continues to flatten (boyd, 2011, 758 Haimson, 2018), rapidly developing technology now retooled for the social world offers the 759 ability to synthesise and project intersecting identity expressions already existing within 760 individuals (Crenshaw, 1989). Participants such as Tim and Polly appear to be attempting to 761 align an understanding which has been long accepted within offline interactions, that an 762 individual tailors’ behaviour for certain audiences within a specific context (Goffman, 1959). 763 As social media now allows others to simultaneous access an individual’s presentation of 764 multiple ‘moments’ written across time responding to these different contexts (including 765 potentially more fluid and queer identity expressions), contemporary online social norms 766 mean youth no longer expect to access a static identity projection of any given individual. 767 Rather it was portrayed that individuals present themselves as a suite of shifting contextually 768 based identity presentations with no single identity presentation offering the holistic sum of 769 their identity.  770 Narratives of Individuality and Autonomy 771 Past research has documented the individuality and diversity of LGBTQ+ youth 772 identities and how simplistic category labels (e.g. gay) masks nuanced experiences (Hostetler 773 & Herdt, 1998). Many of our participants’ stories (such as Sandy or Polly) initially began 774 identification with a simple sexual label, of the type often found in quantitative data sets (e.g. 775 gay, lesbian). However, as their stories unfolded, they narrated a much more complex set of 776 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   29  experiences that required the reconfiguration of sexual descriptors (e.g. pan/queer/fluid) to 777 represent a more nuanced identity that also intersected with wider social classifications such 778 as gender. Such nuanced understanding of identity are important - recent studies have 779 highlighted the differing and distinct experiences of discrimination, stress and psychological 780 health across such identity intersections (e.g., Corrington, Nittrouer, Trump-Steele and Hebl, 781 2019). By acknowledging how an individual’s multiple identities intersect (Crenshaw, 1989), 782 social media offers the ability to tailor new identity configurations of personal and cultural 783 narratives for specific groups (e.g. Queer and of colour) which emphasise autonomy, 784 individuality and choice. For instance, Sarah or Paul/a's stories serve dual roles of both 785 producer and product of discourse on sexual and gender identity (Hammack et al., 2009). By 786 taking control of contexts and opening up multiple identity presentations which co-exist 787 simultaneously, they demonstrate agency which seemed to challenge and reject, rather than 788 continue to replicate the monolithic notions of sexual and gender identity development of 789 previous generations (Driver, 2007; Hammack et al., 2009).  790 By creating autonomous multi-layered identity configurations online, participants 791 were able to employ a more elaborate integration of personal narratives and meaning-making 792 into an overall coherent identity configuration. This rejection of previously prescribed 793 plotlines and characters (Polkinghorn, 1988) even led to questioning the need for a consistent 794 identity altogether. Xander and Sandy employed more 'open' ambiguous terms such as 795 ‘queer’ to denote the fluidity of identity allowed them the ability to express a moving beyond 796 label categorisation, rather conceptualising a non-consistent identity as their core identity. It 797 is of note that by taking control and expressing their different identity labels and projections 798 as publicly or privately as they wished, all participant stories were of things getting better. 799 This did not mean they had no past or present negative interactions, but they no longer felt 800 they had to engage on Tumblr to share queer identity expressions safely, or Facebook was 801 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   30  off-limits for fluid identity expressions. The wider cultural access social media now offers 802 across time and context, empowers adolescents and emerging adults to adopt identities that 803 do not 'fit' within traditional hetro- and homonormative expectations (master narratives) 804 which may have once led participants to consider themselves deviant (Herek, 2007). 805 Implications  806 By offering a person-centred exploration of participant-led narratives, the present study 807 provides an enhanced understanding of how LGBTQ+ youth and particularly those who do 808 not identify within more established identity categories (Mathers, Sumerau & Cragun, 2018), 809 synthesise a coherent sense of identity in the complicated multi-context of contemporary 810 society that straddles two overlapping worlds; offline and online. Our participants told stories 811 of narrative engagement, identity configuration and meaning-making within their identity 812 constructions which were actively shared across multiple contexts. Participants expressed 813 themselves as highly self-reflective individuals, aware of their online identity expressions 814 (Davis & Weinstein, 2017) and how their presentations and ecosystems interact, both off and 815 online. Rather than attempting to ‘edit’ or revise a past history of their own lives (Safranova, 816 2015), participants accepted that permanent evidence of past identities is an inherent feature 817 of the digital world (Davis & Weinstein, 2017). Changing expressions of identity over the 818 course of adolescence were instead integrated into their overarching life story, and these early 819 identity projections - or ‘origin stories’ - were an important expression of who they had been.  820 This has important social implications. Although youth consider social media to be a 821 safe space, their data may be used in ways that they did not intend. Previous papers have 822 recommended that App designers and social media companies need to provide still more 823 explicit safeguards and clear controls for personal information especially for converging 824 cross-platform information sharing practices (Haimson, 2018), but our participants no longer 825 believed that the removal or ability to edit past digital footprints were possible. Instead, they 826 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   31  shifted their approach and expectations of how they used social media. As young people 827 become more accepting of their past digital displays, society must adapt to this developing 828 open multi-projection of identities. The need to recognise that singular past identity 829 projections (e.g. traditional media outlets portrayal of a celebrity tweet using inappropriate 830 (potentially insulting) terminology from their pre-fame teenage years) should not be taken out 831 of context especially for individuals with identities that were still less well understood by the 832 general public, such as those who express more fluid identities. Participants shared stories of 833 displaying sexual and gender identities in more nuanced and subtle ways (such as images 834 with a partner) and no longer relied on the features of any given site for such projections.  835 The findings of the present study highlight how social media plays a critical and 836 overwhelmingly positive role in facilitating LGBTQ+ and particularly queer youths’ 837 narrative identity development. All participants recounted some form of positive learning 838 experiences or redemptive meaning-making (McAdams & McLean, 2013). By offering 839 individuals the ability to reconcile and resolve divergent internalised self-concepts and 840 multiple identity descriptors, social media was identified as a key asset for the task of better 841 contextualising (Erickson, 1968; McAdams, 2015; McLean et al., 2018), and disseminating 842 stories of their adolescent and emerging adult LGBTQ+ lived experience which led to highly 843 positive outcomes of a more stable, secure and authentic sense of their projected identity. To 844 best facilitate future healthy psychosocial development of LGBTQ+ youth, social media 845 should not simply be vilified, or its use discouraged indiscriminately. 846 Limitations 847 Though attempts were made to recruit inclusively with regards to sexual and gender 848 identities (i.e. focusing on same-sex attracted youth rather than specific sexual/gender labels), 849 the group consisted mainly of white university undergraduates who already openly identified 850 as LGBTQ+. Furthermore, all participants were recruited from one university, which is 851 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   32  renowned for inclusivity, yet the small sample of participants represent just a small 852 proportion of the LGBTQ+ community of this institution. Thus, the positive accounts of 853 social media that are presented in this paper may be limited to well-adjusted LGBTQ+ youth 854 living within a particularly inclusive, safe and accepting environment. Given the diverse 855 nature of LGBTQ+ experiences, and the way in which sexual identity intersects with other 856 aspects of identity (e.g. class, gender, race; Crenshaw, 1989), the experiences reported in our 857 sample are likely different from other LGBTQ+ youth. Importantly, not all LGBTQ+ youth 858 have such positive experiences (DeVito et al., 2018; Haimson, 2018), especially those for 859 whom being LGBTQ+ intersects with other marginalised identities (e.g. low SES, race) 860 and/or live within less supportive offline spaces (Taylor, Falconer, & Snowdon, 2014).   861 Narrative approaches are at least in part retrospective studies which focus on 862 participants re-storying their life, how they make sense of these experiences and how this 863 impacts their identity development over time. As the methods used to collect data are focused 864 on the retelling of past events, stories may change and not accurately represent the events 865 themselves. As our focus is on how participants bring meaning to these life moments to find a 866 secure sense of identity bridging their adolescence and adulthood, this may account for their 867 positive outlook recollecting their teen years. Future research is needed to explore how 868 younger adolescents experience social media and identity development ‘in the moment’, as 869 their responses may differ to those given in retrospect. In particular, younger adolescents who 870 may be less comfortable in their LGBTQ+ identity may be an important group for further 871 study, though accessing such individuals may be difficult.  872 Conclusion   873 Participant stories highlight how social media has become a transformative tool for 874 LGBTQ+ youth, and the part social media plays in the reconciliation of nuanced and highly-875 personalised multifaceted identity configurations, which are adaptive to context and change 876 LGBTQ+ YOUTH IDENTITY AND SOCIAL MEDIA   33  over time. Multiple social media platforms were used differentially and often simultaneously 877 to perform differing identity work, particularly during life transitions (Haimson, 2018). 878 Moreover, our research highlights how LGBTQ+ youth, particularly queer female youth, are 879 actively bridging these differing identity projections to take control of their own life stories 880 and make their voice heard (Driver, 2007). By sharing their unique all too often invisible 881 experiences within a world of dominant models of sexual orientation and gender binaries, 882 they reject previous cultural templates which promoted both dominant hetero- and 883 homonormative binary master narratives that do not begin to address the diversity of 884 LGBTQ+ youth lived experiences that are playing out today. By highlighting the safety, 885 autonomy and control afforded contemporary LGBTQ+ youth by the social media 886 environment, we have further contributed to understandings of the process of contemporary 887 youth identity construction, particularly for queer youth and women who have typically been 888 underrepresented in research. 889 References 890 Anderson, M.

    "abstract": "Social media provides LGBTQ+ youth with daily access to a broader socio-cultural dialogue that may shape narrative identity development. Through in-depth narrative interviews, the present study sought to understand the lived experiences of 11 LGBTQ+ undergraduates (Age range = 19 – 23) building narrative identities in the cultural context of social media, and the role of social media within this process. Interviews were analysed using an interpretative, individual analysis of personal stories. These experiences were then compared and contrasted through thematic analysis to identify four shared narratives themes. Narratives of merging safe spaces highlight how LGBTQ+ youth now have regular access to safe environments on/offline which facilitate more secure identity development. Narratives of external identity alignment describe social media as a tool for LGBTQ+ youth to seek out identities that match their pre-existing sense of self. Narratives of multiple context-based identities encapsulate how adolescents’ identity markers are multiple and invoked in a context-dependent manner. Lastly, narratives of individuality and autonomy characterise how LGBTQ+ youth perceive themselves as highly individualised members of a wider community. These findings highlight the complex role social media plays within LGBTQ+ youth identity development. The implications are discussed within",
