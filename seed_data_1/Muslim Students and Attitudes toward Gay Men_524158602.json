No. 1st Sumantri Brojonegoro Street, Bandar Lampung, Indonesia  Abstract The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between the socio-demographic variables, religiosity, childhood trauma scale and Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale and attitudes toward gays. It was conducted at eight regular classes in Lampung University, Indonesia. A total of 336 Muslim students participated in the study by answering the questionnaires. Results indicate that the socio-demographic variables related to attitudes toward gays are the choice of political parties and the type of region of origin. It also shows that religiosity and childhood trauma scale were not related to attitudes toward gays, while the GEM Scale had a negative correlation with attitudes toward gays. Among the sensitive issues with high resistance among students were legalization of gay marriage, gays in the military, gays in public institutions and the recognition of the rights of gays.    Keywords: Religiosity, Childhood trauma scale, GEM scale, Socio-demographics, Attitudes toward gays, Muslim students.  Contents 1.

Introduction Gay men are a minority often suffering from discrimination and even victimization. Various acts of violence include insult, ridicule and threats (Barrientos et al., 2010), verbal abuse and physical violence (Biçmen and Bekiroğullari, 2014) and even murder (Gruenewald, 2012). In the United States, 35% of homicide victims are gay men (National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), 2015). The intensity of violence differs and it is influenced by their social position (Meyer, 2010). Violence against gay men occur worldwide (Dworkin and Yi, 2003). In addition to the real world, violence against gay men also occurs in the virtual world. For example, a study by Padva (2008) showed that gays often experience bullying in various media, such as cinemas, television, journals, web sites, fiction, children‘s story books, comics, music, advertising and pornography.  Public places, such as schools or colleges constitute the ―dangerous‖ arenas for gay men. A study by Ellis (2009) showed that homophobia remains an important issue in the UK where the campus still cannot fully accept gays. Negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians also occur in the workplace (Embrick et al., 2007). Violence is not only carried out by individuals or other groups in society but also by the state institutions. A study by Yu-Rong and Ping (2010) in Taiwan, for example, showed that gays are often treated with prejudice, hostility and violence within the society in addition to government‘s discriminative treatment with hateful discourse. Discrimination leads gay men to experiencing fundamental problems both with regard to personality and social relations in society. According to McDermott et al. (2014) global data showed an increase in suicides and alcohol use among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) of young age. In this case, there is a correlation between homophobia with self-destructive behavior. Duncan et al. (2014) found a higher prevalence for marijuana use among LGBT groups representing the targets for crime/hostility. A study by Kosciw et al. (2013) reported that victimization contributes to low academic achievement and self -esteem among gay men. In addition, other effects of victimization on gays in general are health and well-being (Cunningham, 2011; Heck et al., 2013; Horton, 2014) as well as depressive symptoms (Almeida et al., 2009). In connection with social relations, a study by Knauer (2012) for example, pointed out that gays as a minority group do not have equality before law and are often forgotten in protection programs.  For gay men themselves, the various acts of discrimination and victimization lead them to be in need for social supports. In fact, those social supports are relatively limited. There are several factors affecting those social supports. Swank and Fahs (2013) identified four factors: the level of education, communication, the ability to recognize heterosexuality and commitment to social justice. Meanwhile, Valenti and Campbell (2009) reported that the fear of losing jobs, stigma/social charge of ―gay lifestyle‖ and the safety factor constitute obstacles for someone to provide support to gays. Lack of social support from local communities leads gays to seek other alternative supports, such as in cyberspace. A study by DeHaan et al. (2012) found that LGBT uses the Internet as an efficient way to make friends, to obtain romantic couples, to join LGBT events offline and to get sexual health services. Resistance to gay men occurs in all parts of the world, even in countries recognizing LGBT equal rights in various aspects, such as the UK and Canada (Browne and Nash, 2014). Discrimination and victimization against gay men are inseparable from the public perceptions of gay men. Those perceptions are influenced by various factors. A study by Besen and Zicklin (2007) found that religiosity and fundamentalism have negative effects on community support. Gender and race constitute other variables affecting attitudes toward gays. Meanwhile, a study by Lemelle and Battle (2004) showed that males typically have more negative attitudes than females; and African Americans have more negative attitudes than white residents. However, among African -Americans, women are thought to have the greatest negative attitudes gay men. Overall, the variables considered were age, income, education, residency and religiosity. Theoretically, according to Gerhards (2010) the theories of modernization and religious inheritance help explain differences in the degree of acceptance of homosexuality. The fact remains that there are differences in the acceptance of homosexuality in the 27 EU countries and Turkey. The state policy toward homosexuality is quite varied. A study by Moscati (2010) showed that, although Italy and Spain have in common in terms of the legal and socio-historical backgrounds (legal culture of both countries discriminates homosexuality), their treatment of gays (homosexuality) is different. Spain allows same -sex marriage, while Italy disallows it. Policy variations occur even among s tates in the US. According to Killian (2010) such policy variations have an impact on social service programs and LGBT life itself.  Despite the controversial issue at the global level, homosexuality received less attention in the discipline of sociology. Studies on gays or LGBT in general started in the 1980s. Sociology in this case is a discipline that is lagging behind other disciplines. According to Robertson (2014) the sociological perspective of the process that determines a person identifies himself as gay is the first contribution to the literature of sociology. Ethnographic research found that sexuality is constructed through four processes: infringement of right to hetero sexuality, the search for an explanation, the exploration of sexuality and identity negotiations. According to Stein and Plummer (1994) several sociologists tend to use the assumption that lesbians and gays are less relevant issues.  Not only marginalizing the issue of ―sexual minorities‖, but sociology also has a weakness in explaining the phenomenon. The new ―queer theory‖ is also more developed by scholars outside sociology. Ironically, those scholars use the social constructionist approach which represents a tradition in sociology. According to Moore and Stambolis-Ruhstorfer (2013) future direction of sociological research development needs to be focused on households of same-sex couples and households where parents identify themselves as gays or lesbians. In connection with it, the purpose of the present study was to determine the relationships between several sociological variables and attitudes toward gays. Sociological variables examined in this case were socio-demographic variables (gender, age, ethnicity, boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, organizational membership, the choice of political party and the type of region of origin), religiosity, childhood trauma scale and Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale. Asian Journal of Social Sciences and Management Studies, 2016, 3(4): 256-265     258  2. Methods Questionnaires were distributed to eight regular classes in Lampung University, Indonesia. The researcher strictly complied with the rules of scientific research, such as the explanation that there is no compulsion for the participants to participate in the study. The principles of confidentiality (anonymity) and participant privacy were guaranteed through not stating participants‘ name and other identities in the questionnaire. Participants were also informed that the study was not related to political aspects, but only to determine the students‘ attitudes toward gays currently at issue in Indonesia. The researcher also informed that the study was only for Muslim students. Of 420 questionnaires distributed, 336 were fully completed.  Participants were 148 (44%) men and 188 (56%) women, aged 14 to 29 years (M = 20.07; SD = 1.4) who were attending universities located in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia. In terms of ethnicity, the largest proportion (n = 174; 51.8%) was Javanese, successively followed by Lampung (n = 89; 26.5%), Minang (n = 28; 8.3%), Sundanese (n = 17; 15:15), Batak (n = 8; 2.4%) and other (n = 20; 6.0%). A total of 203 (60.4%) students was active in student organizations and the remaining 133 (39.65) were not. A total of 51 people  had jobs in addition to being college students. A total of 140 (41.7%) students had a boyfriend/partner and the remaining 196 (58.3%) did not. A total 141 (42%) students lived with their parents, 44 (13.1%) students lived with relatives and the remaining 151 (44.9%) students lived in boarding/rented houses. In terms of political parties, 81 (24.1%) students admitted to choose Islamic/religion-based parties, 118 (35.1%) students to choose national parties and the remaining 137 (40.8%) students did not have political parties of choice. Meanwhile, in terms of the type of region of origin, a total of 126 (37.5%) students came from rural areas (rural), 109 (32.4%) students from semi-urban areas and 101 (30.1%) came from urban areas.  2.1. Instrument The questionnaire included five subgroups of questions related to characteristics of the students: demographics (i.e., sex, age, ethnicity, having a boyfriend or girlfriend, student organizational affiliation, monthly expenditure, where they live, political party preference, where they come from/area type), religiosity (how they describe their religious beliefs, experience, knowledge and practices), childhood trauma scale, attitudes toward male-female relationships (GEM scale) and attitudes toward gays. Religiosity was measured by using the scale of El-Menouar (2014) consisting of 22 items: five items of basic religion, six items of central duties, four items of religious experience, three items of religious knowledge and four items of orthopraxis. There were 16 items with a 5-point response including ‗always‘, ‗often‘, ‗sometimes‘, ‗rarely/almost never‘ and ‗never‘. The alternative was ‗very sure‘, ‗sure‘, ‗hesitant‘, unsure, very unsure. A total of 4 items had three answer choices (‗yes‘, ‗sometimes‘, ‗never‘) and 2 items had two answer choices (‗ever‘, ‗never‘) and (‗yes‘, ‗no‘). The childhood trauma scale and attitudes related to men-women relationships (GEM Scale) in the present study were measured using the IMAGES (International Men and Gender Equality Survey) scale which has been tested in various countries (Barker et al., 2011). The childhood trauma scale consisted of 15 items, each of which had four answer choices (‗never‘, ‗sometimes‘, ‗often‘ and ‗very often‘). Meanwhile, GEM Scale consisted of 18 items, each of which had four answer choices (‗strongly agree‘, ‗agree‘, ‗disagree‘ and ‗strongly disagree‘). Despite the high score of validity and reliability of the original scales, but it was still subjected to testing with regard to the different cultural settings. Attitudes toward gays were measured using the scale developed by Raja and Stokes (1998). This scale consists of 22 items divided into three parts: 9 items of Personal Discomfort with Gay Men (PDG), 4 items of Belief homosexuality as Deviant (BHD) and 9 items of Institutional Homophobia toward Gay Men (IHG).  3. Results 3.1. Religiosity The present study measured religiosity using the scale of El-Menouar (2014), which includes five dimensions: basic religion (BR), central duties (CD), religion experience (RE), religion knowledge (RK) and Orthopraxis (OP). The scale is a special scale to measure the religiosity of Muslims. The first dimension (BR) consists of 5 items that measure aspects of faith and devotional practices. The second dimension (CD) consists of 6 items that measure the implementation of the primary obligations of a Muslim, among other, shalat (ritual prayer), Ramadan fasting, pilgrimage to Mecca and the rules of food consumption. The third dimension (RE) consists of four items that measure one‘s religious experiences in relation to God. The fourth dimension (RK) consists of three items that measure one‘s own understanding of religion. The last dimension (OP) consists of four items that measure the consequences of diversity for an individual. Students‘ religiosity scores in the present study ranged 61 to 95 (M = 80.99; SD = 6.099). Table 1 shows that there are several items not relevant as religious measures, especially in the context of student life. The obligation of pilgrimage to Mecca, for example, remains difficult to fulfill by a student in terms of both time and cost. Additionally, such obligation is also limited by quotas so that one must wait for the long waiting list. Thus, whether or not an individual has fulfilled the obligation of pilgrimage to Mecca does not necessarily indicate religiosity. The obligation to avoid shaking hands with the opposite sex is also an aspect of religious practice rarely carried out by the Indonesian people, especially college students. The fact shows that the prohibition is not widely known by the Indonesian Muslims. The prohibition is only understood and implemented by a minority of Muslims. Results of the present study indicate a total of 116 (34.5%) participants said ―no‖ for avoiding handshake with the opposite sex and 220 (65.5%) said ―sometimes‖. In this case, none of the participants stated ―yes‖ (avoid handshake with the opposite sex). Other obligation serving as an orthopraxis dimension is giving alms (donations) which, in the context of students, remains an obligation difficult to meet given the students‘ economic dependence to their parents. Results of the present study shows that only 4 of Asian Journal of Social Sciences and Management Studies, 2016, 3(4): 256-265     259  participants stated ―often‖ for giving alms, 184 (54.8%) said ―sometimes‖, 129 (38.4%) stated ―rarely‖ (―almost never‖) and 19 (5.7%) said ―never‖. In this case, none of the participants  stated ―always‖. Therefore, the dimension of orthopraxis in this context is not relevant for measuring religiosity among the students. It is also evident from the results of the calculation of Pearson correlation as shown in Table 2.  Table-1.

Childhood Trauma Scale  In general, Table 3 shows that the percentage of participants who experienced certain childhood violent traumas is not excessively high except for the trauma in the form of punishment in schools. The types of trauma most frequently experienced by participants are verbal violence within the family, physical violence both within the family and the school and spending time outdoors without being noticed by other family members. Based on the score of trauma scale, a total of 331 (98.5%) participants belonged to the ―low‖ category  and only 5 (1.5%) participants belonged to the ―moderate‖ category. In this case, there was no participant belonging to the ―high‖ category. The participants‘ scores of trauma scale were relatively low with a maximum score of 57 and a minimum score of 15. The mean was 18.71 (SD of 4.575 and variance of 20 933). The score of 57 was an extreme score since there was only one participant with such a score. The highest score after such a score was 35 in three participants.  Table-3. Participants‘ Childhood Trauma Scale No. Types of Trauma NV ST OF VO 1.

Asian Journal of Social Sciences and Management Studies, 2016, 3(4): 256-265     260  3.3. Gender Equitable Men Scale Table 4 shows that participants‘ attitudes toward men-women relationships are a mixture of ―traditional‖ (conservative) and modern views. Examples of participants‘ traditional views are ―the main task of women is cooking‖, ―women have to endure violence for the sake of her family integrity‖, ―I think women should obey their husband‖, ―men should be tough‖ and ―men are the ultimate decision makers about various things in the house‖. Participants‘ views of quite sensitive issues include ―I would be very embarrassed should I have homosexual boys (gay)‖. The percentage of participants stating ―agree‖ and ―strongly agree‖ for this variable is very high. These views reflect a gender bias among young people, such as students.  Additionally, there is also a variable that reflects ―modern‖ views‖. The majority of participants agreed or strongly agreed that ―men and women have the same right to decide the type of contraceptive‖, ―all people should be treated equally‖ and ―men opt in to share domestic chores‖. Overall, with regard to participants‘ attitudes toward male-female relationships (GEM Scale), 289 (86%) of participants were at the level of ―moderate equity‖, 41 (12.2%) participants at the level of ―low equity‖ and only 6 (1.8%) participants at the level of ―high equity‖.

Attitudes toward Gays The present study measured attitudes toward gays by using the scale developed by Raja and Stokes (1998). This scale consists of 22 items which can be grouped into 3 sections: Personal Discomfort with Gay Men (PDG), Belief in Homosexuality as Deviant (BHD) and Institutional Homophobia toward Gay Men (IHG). Each item has answer choices of ―strongly agree‖, ―agree‖, ―disagree‖ and ―strongly disagree‖. Overall, the average score of attitudes toward gays was 59.2351. The lowest score was 37 and the highest was 87 and the standard deviation was 6.2396. Of the total of 22 items on attitudes toward gay, theoretically, the lowest score was 22 and the highest was 88. The higher the score for attitudes toward gay, the more tolerant or positive the attitudes toward the presence of gays in their environment would be. Furthermore, the scores for tolerance to gays are categorized into ―high‖ (the score of 6688), ―moderate‖ (the score of 4465) and ―low‖ (the score below 44). Based on statistical calculations, 6 (1.8%) participants were categorized as ―low‖, 279 (83%) as ―moderate‖ and 51 (15.2%) as ―high‖. In general, participants‘ attitudes toward gays tended to be negative based on the PDG, BHD and IH G. The proportion of participants stating ―disagree‖ and ―strongly disagree‖ for several items was quite large, such as for ―working with a gay men‖, ―inviting gays to parties‖, ―going to gay marriage party‖ and also ―gay strategic roles in various social institutions‖. On the contrary, participants were likely to see gays as deviation and requiring great energy to ―recover‖ to the heterosexual condition. Gay marriage is a sensitive issue in Indonesia and it is also evidenced in the present study as an issue with the highest resistance. Such views are inseparable from the general perspective that gays are ―deviation‖, ―disease‖, ―dregs of society‖ and so on.

Furthermore, correlations among socio-demographic variables, such as gender, age, ethnicity, having a girlfriend/partner, political party preference, region of origin and expenditure, were calculated. Correlations between socio-demographic variables and the homophobia index were calculated using the measures of relationships among the variables calculated, namely the phi coefficient (φ = 1, 0, +1) and Cramer‘s V . The results show only types of region of origin and political party preference had significant relationships. Gender, age, ethnicity, having a girlfriend, organizational membership and expenditures did not have significant relationships with attitudes toward gays. With regard to political party preference, participants preferring national parties tended to be more tolerant than those preferring religious/Islamic parties and those with no political party preference. Meanwhile, with regard to regions of origin, students coming from urban areas tended to be more tolerant than those coming from semi-urban and rural areas. Overall, religiosity was associated with attitudes toward gays and so was childhood trauma scale. Only GEM Scale was associated with attitudes toward gays. The association was negative, meaning that the higher the score of the GEM Scale, the more intolerant to gays would be.

Note: * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.  4. Discussion Attitudes toward gays and homosexuals in general vary among cultures and communities. According to Gerhards (2010) the majority of the European people not support the idea of non-discrimination against homosexuals. A study showed that fifty-five percent of African countries have laws against sex between men. Penalties range from fines, imprisonment, to death (Sallar and Somda, 2011). In America, homophobia is very evident in conservative Christian circles (Linneman, 2004) and more extreme among Negro (blacks) (Literte and Hodge, 2012). Meanwhile, a study by Cashmore and Cleland (2012) for example, showed that, among football fans, 93% claimed no place for homophobia. According to McCormack and Anderson (2014) there are social trends in the U.S.: decreasing homophobia and changing behaviors of heterosexual males.  There are several factors affecting attitudes toward homosexuality. A meta-analysis by Whitley (2001) states that the best predictors of antigay behavior were hyper-participant gender and gender-role orientation; attitudes toward women and modern sexism were also predictors for men but not for women. Meanwhile, Whitehead (2013) identified that religious tradition, theological and political ideology, location, and demographic composition of congregations all influence the degree to which gays and lesbians are included into congregational life. The findings of Verweij et al. (2008) showed that men tend to have negative attitudes toward homosexuals relative to women. Non-heterosexuals encountered lower homophobia than homosexuals. Age had no effect on homophobia. Variation in homophobia scored could be explained by additive genetic (36%), shared environmental (18%) and unique environmental factors (46%).  Asian Journal of Social Sciences and Management Studies, 2016, 3(4): 256-265     263  Several other factors identified by researchers include concepts reproducing the social -moral bonds (Buttaro and Battle, 2012) micropanics (Guittar, 2013) secure attachment style (Jellison and McConnell, 2003) racial discrimination against the ingroup (Craig and Richeson, 2014) the direct environment (Blaauw, 2012) maternal attitudes (Oksal, 2008) the intimacy of contact (Heinze and Horn, 2009; Smith et al., 2009) levels of aversion toward homosexuals (Ncanana and Ige, 2014); educational attainment, communicating with full-fledged activists, having an ability to recognize heterosexism and maintaining a commitment to social justice (Swank and Fahs, 2013) age, educational level, religious affiliation, contact with homosexual persons (Adela, 2010) higher levels of knowledge (Alderson et al., 2009) public policy (Hooghe and Meeusen, 2013) and government institution (Henshaw, 2014). Gender represents a socio-demographic variable frequently taken into account by researchers and associated with attitudes toward gays or minority sexuality in general. The underlying argument is different patterns of gender role socialization between boys and girls which then produces different gender role const ructions. The fact is that such variable inconsistently affects their attitudes towards gay/minority sexuality. Several studies showed that gender had an influence (Kerns and Fine, 1994; Mandra, 2003; Gelbal and Duyan, 2006; Olson et al., 2006; Maher, 2013) however, a number of other researchers found the contrary (Schellenberg et al., 1999; Landicho et al., 2014; Oti-Boadi et al., 2014). In general, researchers who found an association between gender and attitudes toward gays stated that women had a more tolerant attitude than men.  In addition to gender, religion or religiosity is also frequently associated with homophobia. Unlike gender, the facts show that religiosity is consistently associated with homophobia. A number of researchers found a negative relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward homosexuals (Hinrichs and Rosenberg, 2002; Gelbal and Duyan, 2006; Rowatt et al., 2009; Sherkat et al., 2009; Hooghe et al., 2010; Cunningham and Melton, 2012; Clobert et al., 2014; Cragun and Sumerau, 2014; Decoo, 2014; Henshaw, 2014; Kuptsevych, 2014; Gilad and Stepanova, 2015). Results of the present study indicate that gender does not have a relationship with attitudes toward gays, while some aspects of religiosity have a relationship with attitudes toward gays. Overall, religiosity is not associated with attitudes toward gays. Political party preference has a relationship with attitudes toward gays. Two interpretations can be made for this. First, the socialization of values both within the family and society is incapable of shaping a tolerant personality. Or, in other words, the theme of tolerance for diversity doe s not constitute an important point in such socialization in both the primary and secondary levels. Second, in the context of Indonesian culture, the level of resistance to LGBT in general is quite high. Indonesian people consider LGBT community as a form of deviation or ―disease‖ that should be avoided or cured. The primary to higher education has a high resistance to the presence of LGBT. This is evident in the highly significant relationships between the various aspects of religiosity and attitudes towards gays, as shown by the BHD (Belief in homosexuals as deviants). Correlation of various variables to BHD attitudes shows that people‘s understanding of LGBT remains low. A number of issues with resistance among communities include legalization of gay marriage, gays in the military, gay as a doctor and recognition of gay rights (see Table 5). The item of the GEM Scale aimed at measuring homophobia is item number 18 (―I would be very embarrassed should I have homosexual boys (gay)‖. For this item, a total of 304 (90.5%) participants said ―strongly agree‖ and ―agree‖. This means that the level of  homophobia among the participants was very high. This finding is consistent with the general attitudes towards gays which tend to be negative (intolerant). This is consistent with the finding of Barker et al. (2011) that, of the various countries studied, homophobia constitutes the general attitude, despite the variations. Overall, GEM scale has a negative relationship with attitudes toward gays.  5. Conclusion In general, students‘ attitudes toward gays tend to be negative. The socio -demographic variables that have a relationship with attitudes toward gays are political party preference and the type of region of origin. Results of the present study also show that religiosity and childhood trauma scale are not related to attitudes toward gays, but GEM Scale is. Issues related to gays and LGBT generally encounter resistance within communiti es. Such sensitive issues include legalization of gay marriage, gays in the military, gays in public institutions and recognition of the rights of gays. Based on these findings, further studies on LGBT in Indonesia are required in order to design public policies that are acceptable to all parties.  References Adela, M., 2010.

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the relationship between the socio-demographic variables, religiosity, childhood trauma scale and Gender Equitable Men (GEM) Scale and attitudes toward gays. It was conducted at eight regular classes in Lampung University, Indonesia. A total of 336 Muslim students participated in the study by answering the questionnaires. Results indicate that the socio-demographic variables related to attitudes toward gays are the choice of political parties and the type of region of origin. It also shows that religiosity and childhood trauma scale were not related to attitudes toward gays, while the GEM Scale had a negative correlation with attitudes toward gays. Among the sensitive issues with high resistance among students were legalization of gay marriage, gays in the military, gays in public institutions and the recognition of the rights of gays",
