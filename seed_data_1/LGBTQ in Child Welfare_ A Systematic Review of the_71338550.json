Flow Chart for Review Selection, Screening and Inclusion  46- ii -ForewordAs the child welfare field responds to the growing number of older youth who are coming into foster care, new research, policies and practices are emerging to help us most effectively serve those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ). For years, researchers, advocates and practitioners have aspired to understand the needs of this population, craft legal and policy protections and develop practices to assist these young people and their families. To raise awareness and broaden the reach of this work, the Annie E. Casey Foundation commissioned this literature review on youth in child welfare who are LGBTQ as a resource for child welfare leaders, policy makers, providers, supervisors and workers. As child welfare agencies strive to most effectively care for children and young people, we at Casey believe lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth and their families deserve to be affirmed and supported – and they must be free from discrimination.By partnering with child welfare professionals around the country, the Casey Foundation strives to ensure all children have brighter futures. Research shows us, however, that youth who are LGBTQ are significantly overrepresented in foster care. They are more likely to be placed in group facilities and experience more placement disruptions than youth who are not LGBTQ. And they face the same racial inequities and disparities as others in the nation’s foster care system.Many of the best practices documented in the Casey Foundation’s Every Kid Needs a Family policy report will effectively serve youth who are LGBTQ. These practices will keep young people safely with their own families, prioritize placement with relatives and foster families and build strong, permanent family relationships. Meanwhile, it’s critical to ensure that youth who are LGBTQ have good outcomes and are treated equitably. Child welfare systems need equitable, inclusive solutions tailored to young people of all races, ethnicities, and sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions. We thank you for your unyielding commitment to improving the lives of children and families and hope this literature review proves to be a helpful resource in your continued efforts.Tracey FeildDirector, Child Welfare Strategy GroupThe Annie E. Casey Foundation commissioned this literature review on youth in child welfare who are LGBTQ as a resource for child welfare leaders, policymakers, providers, supervisors and workers. - 1 -Executive SummaryINTRODUCTIONYoung people in the child welfare system who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning or queer 1 (LGBTQ) are at a greater risk for many negative experiences, including being less likely to be placed with a permanent family. These young people face discrimination and conflict with their families of origin as well as harassment and violence in group placement settings. To remove obstacles, service providers and families must acknowledge the barriers and seek effective strategies to address them. A growing body of research about young people in the child welfare system who are LGBTQ is available, but before now it had not been synthesized. Service providers, therefore, have lacked a reliable source of information about best practices and effective strategies. To help fill this gap, the Annie E. Casey Foundation commissioned Public Research and Evaluation Services (PRES), which helps nonprofits gather and assess data to improve decision making. PRES identified existing literature and its characteristics, then synthesized it to create a resource for the child welfare field. The review included a focus on gender nonconforming and transgender youth as well as youth of color who are LGBTQ — a key intersection of group identities connected by disparities.This review’s guiding research question: What strategies — evidence-based, evidence-informed or promising practices that  contribute to improved permanence and decreased marginalization — do youth who  are LGBTQ and have experienced the child welfare system receive from frontline staff  and resource families?PRES adapted a framework proposed by Gough, Oliver and Thomas (2012) to do the following:    determine the conceptual framework, questions, eligibility and appraisal criteria for the review;    search the library literature and ascertain the existence of the grey literature (i.e., reports and other documents that have not undergone peer review);    code and process the literature, including quality appraisal, based on the conceptual framework and research questions; and    synthesize and interpret the literature in a final report. To ensure the youth voice in the review’s design, focus groups were conducted with people who are LGBTQ who had experienced the child welfare system. Young people advised on focus group questions and identified themes to help inform the literature search. Experts in child welfare and LGBTQ services also suggested documents, especially unpublished grey literature.LITERATURE REVIEW FINDINGSA total of 116 documents met the review’s inclusion criteria and were analyzed, coded and summarized. The following five topics emerged:    Suggested Best and Promising Practices    Legal and Policy Protections   The Importance of Parental and Family Acceptance   Harassment, Abuse and Negative Treatment   Resulting Risks and Vulnerabilities1  The authors acknowledge that the “Q” in LGBTQ can refer either to questioning or queer youth. Because this review focuses on youth in foster care whose sexuality and gender identity and expression may be emerging, the term “questioning” may be more relevant. We understand terms are evolving. For example, gender nonconforming, boi and pansexual are also used to describe sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions. LGBTQ is used throughout this review to encapsulate this complexity.- 2 -A brief summary of each topic area is described below.SUGGESTED BEST AND PROMISING PRACTICES Sixty-eight documents suggested promising and best practices to better serve LGBTQ youth. Many focused on training needs of child welfare agency staff, parents and caregivers, as well as recruitment of LGBTQ adults to serve as role models, agency professionals and foster and adoptive parents. Articles tended toward similar recommendations. For staff, training needs included cultural competence, confidentiality protocols and awareness about the needs of LGBTQ youth. Parent trainings were recommended to dispel myths and educate caregivers on accepting and supporting LGBTQ youth. LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS Thirty-three documents focused on legal and policy protections. They included laws designed to ensure equal protection, constitutionality in policies and court cases that challenged discrimination and abuse in out-of-care settings. THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEForty-eight documents focused on familial acceptance. The primary recommendation was for social service professionals to support families in the process of accepting a young person who identifies as LGBTQ. A prevalent suggestion was to find family or fictive kin who can provide a safe, welcoming home.HARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTNinety-one documents highlighted harassment or abuse either through narrative discussions or primary or secondary data analysis. Of those documents, 59 noted LGBTQ teens face negative treatment from at least one source, such as parents and other family, peers, agency staff, foster family and providers. RESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESSixty-six articles focused on the risks and vulnerabilities that result most often from stigmatization, abuse and harassment. Among the most common negative outcomes were homelessness, sexually risky behavior, substance use and abuse, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. DISCUSSION SUMMARYIt is rare to find reviews of studies of interventions to assess effectiveness of LGBTQ programs for youth in out-of-home care, the literature revealed. However, guidelines for improving best practices for LGBTQ youth were replete in the literature. Consequently, these information gaps prevent drawing definitive conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different approaches. Quality research, covering a broader range of interventions, is needed to ensure effective services designed to mitigate negative experiences and improve the lives of young people in foster care who are LGBTQ. - 3 -IntroductionMore than 400,000 youth are in foster care in the United States, according to Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System’s (AFCARS) 2014 data. Multiple studies estimate LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the child welfare system. A 2014 Williams Institute study of Los Angeles youth in foster care found the percentage of those who are LGBTQ is as much as twice that of youth not in foster care (Wilson, Cooper, Kastanis, & Nezhad). The Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth: Outcomes at 26, which collected data from youth in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin, also revealed this overrepresentation. Among the 321 female respondents, 27.5 percent identified as something other than 100 percent heterosexual. Specifically, 12.8 percent identified as mostly heterosexual, 6.9 percent as bisexual, 0.9 percent as mostly homosexual,2 2.8 percent as 100 percent homosexual, 1.9 percent as not sexually attracted to either gender and 2.2 percent selected “don’t know.” Of the 251 males, 7.2 percent identified as something other than 100 percent heterosexual. Specifically, 3.2 percent identified as mostly heterosexual, 0.4 percent as bisexual, 0.4 percent as mostly homosexual, 1.2 percent as 100 percent homosexual, 0.8 percent as not sexually attracted to either gender and 1.2 percent chose “don’t know.” (Courtney, Dworsky, Brown, Cary, Love, & Vorhies, 2011). According to the Lambda Legal/Child Welfare League of America Joint Initiative (2012), family disapproval and rejection often force LGBTQ youth into foster care and homelessness, making them more likely to be part of the child welfare system. Many LGBTQ youth in the child welfare LGBTQ in Child WelfareA SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATUREsystem are there because of rejection from their biological families as a result of making their sexual orientation known. Others, when they come out, are in the child welfare system because their foster families returned them to care. This rejection places these LGBTQ youth at a greater risk for negative life outcomes, including increased chances of health and mental health challenges, lower self-esteem, illegal drug abuse, HIV and STDs and depression and suicide (Child Welfare League of America, 2012). LGBTQ youth are also more likely to have negative experiences in the child welfare system as they are less likely to achieve permanency (Mallon, 2011); more likely to have multiple placements (Mallon, Aledort & Ferrera, 2002); more likely to be sexually abused (Shpiegel & Simmel, 2016; Mitchell, Panzarello, Grynkiewicz, & Galupo, 2015) and to face discrimination, including harassment and violence in group placements (Mallon, 2001). To remove obstacles, service providers and families must acknowledge the barriers and seek effective strategies to address them. A growing body of research is available about young people in the child welfare system who are LGBTQ, but before now it had not been synthesized. Service providers, therefore, have lacked a reliable source of information about best practices and effective strategies. To help fill this gap, the Casey Foundation commissioned PRES to identify existing literature and its characteristics, then synthesize it to create a resource for the child welfare field. The review included a focus on gender nonconforming and transgender youth as well as youth of color who are LGBTQ — a key intersection of group identities connected by disparities. 2   This is the term the study uses and authors acknowledge it is no longer a preferred term in the LGBTQ community.- 4 -MethodsPRES adapted a framework proposed by Gough, Oliver and Thomas (2012) to do the following:    determine the conceptual framework, questions, eligibility and appraisal criteria for the review;    search the library literature and ascertain the existence of the grey literature;    code and process the literature, including quality appraisal, based on the conceptual framework and research questions; and    synthesize and interpret the literature in a final report. This review’s guiding research question: What strategies — evidence-based, evidence-informed or promising practices that  contribute to improved permanence and decreased marginalization — do youth who  are LGBTQ and have experienced the child welfare system receive from frontline staff  and resource families?The overall purpose/approach for the systematic review was to determine what literature exists, the characteristics of the literature and to synthesize it for presentation to the Child Welfare Strategy Group (CSWG). More specific information about the literature review process, including the exclusion and inclusion criteria are presented in the appendices.The Youth VoiceTo ensure the youth voice in the review’s design, focus groups were conducted with people who are LGBTQ who had experienced the child welfare system. They reviewed the focus group questions and provided clarity and suggestions on the questions. Experts in child welfare and LGBTQ services also suggested documents, especially unpublished grey literature. Expert GuidanceExperts in the fields of child welfare and LGBTQ services were engaged after most of the peer-reviewed documents had been obtained and as part of efforts to learn about the grey unpublished literature, including evaluation reports. They were also asked to recommend others with expertise in the topic areas. Gary Mallon, executive director of the National Center for Child Welfare Excellence at the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, was invaluable to the review team. With extensive child welfare experience, Mallon is a leader in the field of LGBTQ issues. He provided a list of his publications and suggested the following experts. Some recommended documents or projects that might include evaluation reports for inclusion  in the synthesis.  Ellen Kahn, Human Rights Campaign   Jama Shelton, True Colors   Bill Bettencourt, Center for the Study of Social Policy   Robin McHaelen, True Colors in Connecticut    Document Characteristics This review included 116 documents published between 1992 and 2016. Five topics emerged:     Best and Promising Practices    Legal and Policy Protections   The Importance of Parental and Family Acceptance   Harassment, Abuse and Negative Treatment    Resulting Risks and VulnerabilitiesOrganization of the Report The next section of the report presents the literature synthesis for each of the topic areas. It includes Table 1, which presents a description of each document that covered the topics of: Best and Promising Practices and/or Legal and Policy Protections. Table 1 designates documents that were empirical studies and if they addressed assessments/tools, training, included transgender youth or focused on groups of color. The criteria used to make those designations are in Appendix B. - 5 -A table for the remaining topics that emerged is in Appendix C. Table 2: Supporting Literature shows documents that addressed the topics of: The Importance of Parental and Family Acceptance; Harassment, Abuse and Negative Treatment; and Resulting Risks and Vulnerabilities. These topics were recurring themes in most documents. The criteria for designations in Table 2 are also in Appendix B. Two articles did not fall under the themes on Tables 1 or 2. Both were versions of the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Functioning of Former Foster Youth. They presented data on percentages of youth formerly in foster care identifying as LGBTQ in Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin at age 21 (Courtney, Dworsky, Ruth, Havlicek, Perez, & Keller, 2007) and at age 26 (Courtney, Dworsky, Brown, Cary, Love, & Vorhies, 2011).  Literature Review Topic SummariesBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICES Sixty-eight documents suggested best and promising practices to better serve LGBTQ youth. Many focused on training needs of child welfare agency staff, parents and caregivers, as well as recruitment of LGBTQ adults to serve as role models, agency professionals and foster and adoptive parents. Articles tended toward similar recommendations. For staff, training needs included cultural competence, confidentiality protocols and awareness about the needs of LGBTQ youth. Parent trainings were recommended to dispel myths and educate caregivers on accepting and supporting LGBTQ youth. Research projects such as the Human Rights Campaign (2015) provided recommendations aimed at improving the family connections, out-of-care experiences and long-term outcomes of LGBTQ youth. Recommendations included policymakers requiring nondiscrimination policies be adopted by any child welfare agency receiving federal funds. Researchers also suggested agencies include questions about sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression on all agency data collection instruments. Table 1  presents best and promising practice suggestions revealed through the literature review.LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS Thirty-three documents focused on legal and policy protections. They included laws designed to ensure equal protection, constitutionality in policies and court cases that challenged discrimination and abuse in out-of-home settings. One article (Human Rights Campaign, 2015) found 13 states and the District of Columbia have foster care nondiscrimination laws or policies inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity. Seven others have foster care nondiscrimination laws or policies inclusive of sexual orientation only. Table 1 presents documents covering legal and policy protections that emerged from the literature.- 6 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSPutting the pieces together for queer youth: A model of integrated assessment of need and program planning Berberet, H.M. (2006).The goal of this article was to emphasize the importance of using a needs assessment process in developing services for LGBTQ youth. The needs assessment revealed contextual data about the housing needs and gaps and barriers in services for LGBTQ youth 12–24 years old, who were living on the streets, in shelters, group homes, foster homes, juvenile justice facilities and other residential organizations. Data were also collected regarding the cultural competency of staff serving LGBTQ youth. This article explains how funds were raised to support the needs assessment, as well as how the target population was accessed, how the data were collected (interviews and focus groups) and how the findings were presented. A key strategy in the presentation of the final results involved the convening of a retreat where the planning committee actually met the youth for whom the housing program was being designed.X X X XRepresenting transgender youth: Learning from Mae’s journeyBevel, G. (2011). The purpose of this article was to highlight transgender youths’ rights to safety in schools, freedom of expression (including in dress) and equal access to activities. These and other rights are protected in the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, First Amendment and Title IX. In this article, through the story of Mae, a transgender youth, the author provides information about transgender youths’ rights, as well as legal tools, practice tips and training resources useful for advocacy and legal practice.

(2014). The purpose of the fourth chapter of this review was to focus specifically on LGBT populations and the child welfare system. Strategies for providing effective services were suggested by child welfare experts and practitioners, including that agencies adopt and enforce policies that bar discrimination and that they provide training to staff and caregivers to increase their LGBT competency.

It includes a historical perspective regarding standards of care and a set of recommended practices for promoting safety and well-being. Recommended practices include implementation of written policies prohibiting discrimination and services that address family rejection and facilitate reunification. The document also includes information regarding the professional and legal responsibilities of faith-based providers serving LGBTQ youth.X X X XPractice kit 10: LGBTQ youth advocacyChildren's Law Center.

Included documents can be used by families, practitioners and professionals. They include lists of best practices, legal considerations when working with LGBTQ youth, training materials and self-assessments for practitioners. Resources originated from organizations such as the Children’s Bureau, National Center for Lesbian Rights and Administration for Children and Families.X X X X X XFoster parents’ perspectives on LGB youth in the child welfare systemClements, J.A., & Rosenwald, M. (2008).The purpose of this study was to explore foster parents’ concerns about caring for LGB youth. Twenty-five foster parents participated in focus groups where they expressed misconceptions and a general lack of knowledge about this population of youth. This included believing that gay children would molest their other children and not understanding the difference between someone who is gay and one who identifies with a gender different from his or her biological one.

The four phases were: phase one — environmental scan and key informant interviews; phase two — focus groups; phase three —the Youth Speak Out Survey; and phase four — community feedback. The article also presented the resulting system of care that was proposed. This included the need for a service continuum, prevention education workshops, youth speaker trainings, youth enrichment events, highly-trained care coordinators and weekly community-based group counseling.

(2006).This article aimed to discuss some of the legal claims made by LGBTQ youth in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. As a result of these cases, rights have been specified for youth who identify as LGBTQ. These include rights to equal protection, first amendment rights and specific state-level anti-discrimination laws. A section of the article is devoted to protections specific to transgender youth such as the right to access appropriate medical care.X XLGBT youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems: Charting a way forwardFedders, B. (2014).This article aimed to highlight some of the reasons why LGBTQ youth enter the juvenile justice system. It also discusses the significance of recent legal and policy changes and offers thoughts about how gender and sexual equality can result in reduced numbers of youth in the system. It finds that strides are being made in education, organizing and litigation. For instance, litigation has been brought by the ACLU and other organizations who seek to close the gap in service and treatment of individuals who identify as LGBTQ. The article suggests that efforts continue so that LGBTQ individuals do not enter the child welfare system at all.X XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 11 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSToolkit for practitioners/ researchers working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/ questioning (LGBTQ) runaway and homeless youth Ferguson-Colvin, K., & Maccio, E.M.

It also includes templates for anti-discrimination policies and lists training resources for staff and youth. An overview of policy and legislation is also provided.X X X X X XRepresenting LGBTQ youth in foster care and juvenile justice systemsForte, K. (n.d.). The purpose of this article was to present the process that the Legal Aid Society in New York City engaged in to become culturally competent in serving its LGBTQ clients. The organization’s Juvenile Rights Practice (JRP) had been defending the rights of LGBTQ youth since 2006; and the Legal Aid Society decided to implement additional efforts to develop culturally competent services. The task of building cultural competence in the Legal Aid Society overall started with creation of the LGBT Law and Policy Initiative. The second goal of the Legal Aid Society was to evaluate legal issues that affect LGBTQ clients at disproportionate rates and to determine ways to reduce the disparities. The process was aided by New York’s Code for Professional Conduct for Attorneys and the organization's anti-discrimination policy that covers gender identity and sexual orientation.

(2015).The goal of this study was to assess the validity of the LGBTQ Youth Cultural Competency (LGBTQY-CC) scale. This instrument is used to identify participants’ knowledge, attitudes, skills and awareness of culturally competent practices when working with LGBTQ youth. It can be used by service providers to assess the cultural competence of direct-care workers. The obtained information can then guide training programs to ensure that all workers are culturally competent in meeting the needs of LGBTQ youth.X X X XToward providing a welcoming home for all: Enacting a new approach to address the longstanding problems lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth face in the foster care systemGilliam, J.W., Jr. (2004).This article aimed to investigate the constitutionality of programs that attempt to match LGBT youth with adults of similar sexual orientation. The article states that LGBT youth already face violations of their constitutional rights. They do not have equal protection and have difficulty finding appropriate placements. The article concludes that sexual orientation can be used as a matching category similar to what has been used to match youth to placements with adults of similar race or similar religious beliefs.X XSelf-assessment checklist for personnel providing services and supports to LGBTQ youth and their familiesGoode, M.A., & Fisher, S.K.

(n.d.b).This guide was developed to provide information about the care and support of LGBTQ youth. It includes terminology, results from the Growing Up LGBTQ in America study of 10,000 youth and where to find information about legal rights. Practice recommendations include acknowledging that LGBTQ youth do exist in the child welfare system and that standards for age-appropriate romantic behavior should be consistent for heterosexual and non-heterosexual teens.X X X XLGBTQ youth in the foster care systemHuman Rights Campaign. (2015).The goal of this document was to present the landscape of protections for LGBTQ youth in the foster care system in the United States. Seven states have foster care nondiscrimination laws or policies inclusive of sexual orientation. They are: Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, Virginia and Wisconsin. Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have foster care nondiscrimination laws or policies inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity. They are: California; Colorado; Connecticut; Washington, D.C.; Iowa; Maine; New Jersey; New Mexico; New York; Ohio; Oregon; Rhode Island; Texas; and Washington. The document also provides recommendations at the policy, organizational and individual levels. They include requiring that nondiscrimination policies be adopted by any child welfare agency receiving federal funds, including sexual orientation and gender identity on all agency data collection instruments, and training all adults on how to be affirming so that youth feel comfortable whether they have come out or not.X X XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 14 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSAchieving permanency for LGBTQ youth Jacobs, J., & Freundlich, M. (2006).This article aimed to discuss issues surrounding permanency and LGBTQ youth. Recommendations include creating environments where every child feels safe, protected and served; establishing and enforcing nondiscrimination policies; and providing professional services to help youth overcome fears about adoption, rejection and negative outcomes relating to permanency. Legal support is particularly necessary for transgender youth who need parental permission to receive hormone treatments and to change names. The article suggests that reunification should be the first permanency option.

The section \"A Life of Risks\" discusses risk factors that lawyers and judges must account for when handling cases with LGBTQ youth. In their legal roles, lawyers and judges can advocate for these youth. Not only is it important to meet the young person's needs, but confidentiality is also critical.XStrong relationship, strong advocacy: Tips for building relationships with LGBTQ youth Khoury, A. (2008, January).This article aimed to present the third in a four-part series on issues germane to lawyers working with LGBTQ youth in child welfare. Its focus is on how strong relationships can allow lawyers to advocate for their LGBTQ clients.  Lawyers can build strong relationships by being open to listen, being nonjudgmental, using non-gender-specific language, having LGBTQ-friendly posters and stickers and maintaining confidentiality. Judges can be supportive by appointing lawyers who specialize in the needs of the child, having a courtroom that's open and nonjudgmental, allowing the child to speak in court and maintaining confidentiality. For instance, the judge should not discuss the youth's sexual orientation in open court if he/she does not desire to disclose his or her status.XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 15 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSGroup work practice with transgendered male to female sex workersKlein, R.

It covers topics directed at youth, so they are aware of their legal rights; families, so they understand the impact of family acceptance; and caseworkers, so they know how to prepare youth for a healthy transition to adulthood. Recommended practices for caseworkers include seeking out affirming placements for the youth and ensuring that they receive developmentally appropriate sexual health services. A section for attorneys, guardians ad litem and advocates is also included where they are advised to connect to additional resources such as the Equity Project and the American Bar Association Center on Children and the Law regarding their guidelines for lawyers and judges serving LGBTQ foster care youth.

It also presents comments collected from lawyers, judges and LGBTQ youth at five listening forums held around the country. It states that even if they have negative feelings about LGBTQ youth, professional responsibilities require that judges and lawyers create nurturing environments for these youth.

It notes that finding permanent homes for LGBTQ youth can be facilitated when lawyers and judges use best practices. Permanency plans may include reunification with family members who are ready to accept and support the youth. They may also include plans for independence, recruiting adoptive parents or Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) that prepares the youth for transitioning out of care with at least one supportive adult in his/her life.X XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 17 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth needs and services [PowerPoint] (n.d.).Unknown The aim of this PowerPoint presentation was to focus on LGBTQ youth in the state of Delaware. One slide focused on LGBTQ youth in child welfare and highlighted findings by the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services. It estimated that between 20 and 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ and that 78 percent of LGBTQ youth were removed or ran away from their foster placements as a result of hostility toward their sexual orientation or gender identity. Lack of reunification or permanency often resulted in LGBTQ youth losing connections to their communities and families of origin. The PowerPoint also noted that rather than receiving educational, physical and mental health services, LGBTQ youth are often barred from accessing these services. It suggests that safe spaces should be created. In addition, agencies can use paraphernalia such as banners and posters to show LGBTQ youth that they are welcome.XA room of one’s own: Safe placement for transgender youth in foster careLove, A. (2014). The purpose of this article was to highlight a firsthand account of one transgender youth who encountered abuse while in care. Youth-on-youth violence is prevalent against transgender youth and, unfortunately, staff who work in congregate care settings often do not effectively protect them. It is recommended that transgender youth be placed in LGBTQ-only group homes, such as Green Chimneys, where they will be safe and welcomed. Additionally, the article proposes legislation for mandated transgender-only bedrooms and bathrooms in group homes that are not designated for LGBTQ youth.

(1997b).This article aimed to present a three-hour training model that utilizes an empowerment-based approach with LGBTQ youth and child welfare workers. Developed by Green Chimneys in New York City, the three-hour workshop trains 15–20 participants through lectures, role plays, video presentations, small group discussions and question-and-answer periods. Participants learn about appropriate language and why youth prefer the term gay, lesbian or bisexual rather than the medically based term “homosexual.” Developmental needs, the coming out process, LGBTQ youth and the child welfare system and creating nurturing environments are also discussed.X X XAfter care, then where? Outcomes of an independent living programMallon, G.P. (1998a).This article aimed to present independent living outcomes for clients discharged from the Green Chimneys Life Skills Program. While in the program, youth completed a Life Skills Assessment (LSA) initially, semiannually and at discharge. They also participated in a weekly life skills course and in two weekly individual counseling sessions, one with a social worker and one with a life skills coordinator. For the study the LSA was analyzed and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 43 of the 46 former clients. Youth reported an increase in all 14 life skills categories, including personal appearance, health care, educational planning, housekeeping skills, money and food management, job seeking and maintenance skills, housing skills, transportation, legal issues and interpersonal skills.X X X X XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 20 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSPermanency for LGBTQ youthMallon, G.P. (2011).The purpose of this article was to explore the challenges of providing permanency for LGBTQ youth. The author proposes preservation of the youth’s relationship with his/her family of origin as the first permanency option to be considered. Services to preserve that relationship would be based on the family’s needs and may include coordination of family support and/or provision of intensive, in-home strategies. If reunification is not possible, then the author recommends consideration of legal guardianship since it permits the youth to identify nonrelated adults with whom he/she can form a permanent connection. XThere's no place like home: Achieving safety, permanency, and well-being for lesbian and gay adolescents in out-of-home care settingsMallon, G.P., Aledort, N., & Ferrera, M.

The two agencies provide models of care that can be explored by state and local districts around the country. They have developed strategies that are cost effective and replicable. Benefits of these models in stability and permanence are seen in the children when they are in care and when they leave the programs.X XTransgender children and youth: A child welfare practice perspectiveMallon, G.P., & DeCrescenzo, T. (2006).The purpose of this article was to support transgender children and their families. Nineteen recommendations are made, and the first five are: 1) child welfare professionals must educate themselves about transgender children and youth; 2) programs should be avoided that attempt to change children, because they may do more harm than good; 3) treatments for depression should focus on the depression or other conditions, not enforce gender-stereotypical behavior; 4) parents and children should reach mutually acceptable compromise strategies — for instance, a child  who wants to adopt an opposite gender name can use an androgynous name; and 5) parents and young people can work with practitioners to have open communication that shows love, acceptance and compassion.

(2006).The goal of this article was to highlight the need for effective programs that meet the needs of LGBTQ youth and their families. To effectively serve LGBTQ youth and their families, professionals must first acknowledge that they have clients who are LGBT. Public- and private-sector providers must recognize that families have to be enhanced and separation must be avoided. Local policies have been put in place in large urban areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and San Francisco. However, it is necessary for all child welfare professionals and agencies to recognize and acknowledge the large role that gender and sexual orientation play in people's lives.XA place of respect: A guide for group care facilities serving transgender and gender non-conforming youthMarksamer, J. (2011).The goal of this guide was to present not only recommendations but also legal requirements for organizations serving transgender and gender nonconforming youth. It presents solutions for nine common problems facing transgender and gender nonconforming youth. For instance, instead of showing lack of respect and support for youth’s gender identity and expression, staff should acknowledge, respect and support them by allowing young people to express the gender identity they choose. Placements must also be appropriate, and verbal harassments, threats and violence must not be tolerated. The guide also notes that isolating the transgender or gender nonconforming youth is not an acceptable solution to prevent other youth from being abusive or violent.X X XBEST AND PROMISING PR ACTICES AND LEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONS- 22 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYBEST AND PROMISING PRACTICESLEGAL AND POLICY PROTECTIONSASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS TRAININGTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSOut of the shadows: Supporting LGBTQ youth in child welfareMartin, M., Down, L., & Erney, R.

Through interviews with 53 LGBTQ youth (37 of whom are people of color) 18–31 years old, the report presents the views of young people. These youth represented a diverse spectrum of racial, sexual orientation and gender identities. Quotes from these interviews are provided throughout the report. In addition, three policy categories are suggested: 1) ensure all youth have the resources necessary for healthy development; 2) promote the safety of LGBTQ youth; and 3) commit to achieving permanency for LGBTQ youth. Legal issues are also presented such as legislation in the state of Illinois called the “Youth Mental Health Protection Act” of 2015 (Ill.

(2012).This book chapter aimed to show that a disproportionately high number of children in the child welfare system identify as LGBTQ. This suggests that they are more likely to be removed from their homes or to run away from home than their non-LGBTQ peers. When organizations create supportive, positive, inclusive and affirming environments, all youth benefit. For LGBTQ youth, they can develop a sense of self-worth and belongingness that is necessary for them to overcome potential negative outcomes.X XBridges, barriers, and boundariesMcHaelen, R.P.

Topics included the coming-out process, same-sex acceptance by parents and foster parents and myths about LGBTQ orientations. It was felt that this specific parenting class was necessary because other studies have found that parents of LGBTQ youth are searching for other parents with whom they can discuss the problems they are facing. In addition, research indicates that when parents support their LGBTQ youth, the child is less likely to experience negative outcomes.X XMoving the margins: Training curriculum for child welfare services with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in out-of-home careNational Association of Social Workers.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEForty-eight documents highlighted the importance of familial acceptance for LGBTQ youth. Ryan (2009) reported that many lesbians, gay men and bisexuals, don’t “come out” as adolescents, but wait until adulthood because of fear of rejection and extreme negative reactions. The extreme or high rejection puts youth at risk for health and mental health issues. Ryan (2009) reported:Compared with LGBT young people who were not rejected or were only a little rejected by their parents and caregivers because of their gay or transgender identity, highly rejected young people were more than eight times as likely to have attempted suicide, nearly six times as likely to report high levels of depression, more than three times as likely to use illegal drugs and more than three times as likely to be at high risk for HIV and STDs. (p. 4)McCormick, Schmidt and Terrazas (2015) spoke to the importance of acceptance from the foster family too, citing that in accepting families foster parents served as advocates and activists against maltreatment and made efforts to achieve friendships with affirming and other LGBTQ youth. Accepting foster families were reported by youth as making them feel empowered and liberated.A primary recommendation to ensure family acceptance was for social service professionals to support families through the process of accepting their child or young person after he/she identifies as LGBTQ. Another prevalent suggestion presented in the literature was to find supportive family members or fictive kin who would provide a safe and welcoming home for the young person, which might include foster or adoptive parents who also identified as LGBTQ. Three studies analyzed and presented recommendations from youth — Davis, Saltzburg, & Locke (2009); McCormick, Schmidt, & Terrazas (2015); and The Center for the Study of Social Policy (2014). HARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENT Ninety-one documents presented information on harassment, abuse and negative treatment (see Table 2), either through narrative discussions or primary or secondary data analysis. Among those studies, many recognized that LGBTQ teens face negative treatment from one or more sources such as parents and other family members, peers, agency staff, foster family members and providers. In 15 studies, data or stories were included from youth — Banghart (2013); Desetta (2003); Forge (2012); Gallegos, White, Ryan, O’Brien, Pecora, & Thomas (2011); Irvine, & Canfield (2016); Love (2014); Mallon (1997c); Mallon (1998b); McCormick, Schmidt, & Terrazas (2015); Nolan (2006); Ragg, Dennis, & Ziefert (2006); Shpiegel & Simmel (2016); The Center for the Study of Social Policy (2014); Wilson, Cooper, Kastanis, & Nezhad (2014); and Wilson & Kastanis (2015). Twenty-four studies presented strategies or recommendations to prevent or counteract the negative environments and attitudes that LGBTQ youth have had to endure — Block & Matthews (2008); Children’s Law Center (2015); Ferguson-Colvin & Maccio (2012); Gilliam (2004); Human Rights Campaign (n.d.b.); Human Rights Campaign (2015); Mallon (1992); Mallon (1997b); Mallon (2008); Mallon & DeCrescenzo (2006); Marksamer (2011); Matarese (2012); Minnesota Department of Human Services (2012); Perron (2015); Phillips, McMillen, Sparks, & Ueberle (1997); Poirier (n.d.); Poirier & Weisgal (2015); Ragg, Dennis, & Ziefert (2006); Sikerwar, & Rider (2015); Sullivan (2001); Toner (2013); Travers & Paoletti (1999); Wilber, Ryan, & Marksamer (2006); and Winter (2013). Recommendations included some form of education or training for adults including staff members or birth, foster or adoptive parents. Suggestions for additional research to ascertain the extent to which public child welfare agencies are initiating steps to improve services to LGBTQ youth were provided by the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the document, “LGBT Populations and the Child Welfare System: A Snapshot of the Knowledge Base and Research Needs.” - 36 -RESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES Sixty-six articles highlighted the resulting risks and vulnerabilities experienced by LGBTQ youth. Among the most common negative outcomes were homelessness, sexually risky behavior, substance use and abuse, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and disproportionate representation in the juvenile justice system. Mitchell et al. (2015) stated that when compared to their heterosexual peers, LGBTQ youth have more incidences of anxiety, depression, anger and even posttraumatic stress disorder related to abuse. They also may experience decreased opportunities for post-placement services and resources due to placement instability (Mallon, 2001, as cited in Mitchell et al., 2015). One study highlighted low-economic outcomes, including instability in employment and lower hourly pay for LGBTQ youth, when compared to their non-LGBTQ peers (Dworsky, 2013). In terms of strategies to counteract poor outcomes related to housing, education and employment, Banghart (2013) suggested extended foster care, where youth receive training and assistance in how to find housing and help in applying for school to mitigate negative circumstances. Another strategy to improve housing outcomes was implemented by Berberet (2006) and involved a needs assessment designed to determine the availability of housing while bringing stakeholders together to learn about the needs of LGBTQ youth. Another document that included strategies to counteract or mitigate barriers to self-sufficiency is Burwick, Gates, Baumgartner, & Friend (2014). In addition to information about improvement of self-sufficiency, Poirier (n.d.) provides guidance on how to improve services for improving emotional and behavior outcomes of LGBTQ youth. Other documents that suggest strategies for improving emotional and behavior outcomes include: Children’s Law Center (2015); Marksamer (2011); Matarese (2012); Perron (2015); and Ragg, Dennis, & Ziefert (2006).Discussion SummaryMAIN GAPS IN THE LITERATURE REVIEWIt is rare to find reviews of studies of interventions to assess effectiveness of LGBTQ programs for youth in out-of-home care, the literature revealed. However, guidelines for improving best practices for LGBTQ youth were replete in the literature. Consequently, these information gaps prevent drawing definitive conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different approaches. Quality research, covering a broader range of interventions, is needed to ensure effective services designed to mitigate negative experiences and improve the lives of young people in foster care who are LGBTQ. These observations may best be informed by the Children’s Bureau’s risk and protective factors framework (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2013), which is based on socioecological theory (Garbarino, 1977). Suggested indicators that could be considered in these evaluation studies are captured in the chart on page 37.Interventions to improve the outcomes of LGBTQ youth placed in out-of-home care cannot rest solely on the child welfare system. Efforts must focus on enhancing collaborations between child welfare agencies and other service providers, including juvenile justice, mental health, education and legal resources to overcome boundaries that impede the provision of service, according to many authors cited in this review. Alignment, consistency and cooperation among youth-serving organizations are key to achieving those objectives, which raises the importance of developing networking practices. The conditions that generate quality services and programs for LGBTQ youth must be detailed, which means going beyond the interests and mandates of youth-serving groups to provide more holistic, less sector-bound services. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONSBecause a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined, the literature search had guidance and included studies that spoke to the topic of LGBTQ youth in child welfare. Also, by including documents from various sources (not only peer-reviewed articles), the review minimized publication bias. This strength can also be a limitation because study quality was not specified by non-peer-reviewed documents. The most persistent limitation was the lack of rigorous intervention studies. For this reason, no meta-analytical approaches could be used. - 37 -ECOLOGICAL LEVEL PROTECTION/PROMOTION RISK FACTORS SAMPLE PROTECTIVE INDICATORS SAMPLE RISK INDICATORSYouth Level •  Positive/negative behaviors•  Good/poor mental health•  Social competence•  Cognitive abilities•  General functioning •  School attendance •  Sleep quality•  Self-esteem•  Friends•  Language, math and reading abilities•  IQ•  Externalizing behaviors  (aggression, violence) •  Substance abuse•  Early sexual risk behaviors,  self-mutilation•  PTSD•  Anxiety•  Dissociation•  Difficulties with peers•  Isolation/solitudeParental Level (includes biological parents, foster parents, adoptive parents or other guardian)•  Effective coping skills•  Positive intimate partner relationships (if in two-parent home)/spouse conflict•  Positive/poor parenting practices•  Good/poor mental health•  Stress•  Safety•  Aptitude for problem solving•  Self-esteem•  Anger management•  Marital satisfaction•  Supportive of various sexual identities•  Adverse/coercive behavior•  Use of physical punishment•  Depression•  Reoccurrence of maltreatment•  HomophobiaFamily Level •  Family cohesion•  Supportive family climate•  Good communication•  Organization of family life•  Permanence•  Climate, empathy, supportive•  Placement stability•  Sibling placement/sibling visitation•  Family conflicts•  Placement instability•  Sibling separationCommunity Level •  Presence/lack of resources and social supports to transition to adulthood• Size of informal network•  Access to and use of community supportsSOCIOECOLOGICAL INDICATORS AS A FUNCTION OF PROTECTION-PROMOTION AND RISK FACTORS AFFECTING LGBTQ YOUTH- 38 -FUTURE RESEARCHRigorous studies are needed to identify effective interventions. This type of research is needed in all areas ranging from those supporting families to prevent disruption to programs that prepare youth for after-care outcomes. Studies also are needed with sample sizes large enough to analyze subpopulations. In some of the reviewed studies, the number of transgender youth were small and their voices were either grouped with others, for instance with lesbian participants, or were not analyzed at all. Studies are needed to identify factors that affect rates of maltreatment. Research is needed to test whether positive outcomes are seen when LGBTQ youth are in placements with LGBTQ adults. Lastly, research is needed about the needs and outcomes of LGBTQ youth aging out or who have aged out. References Banghart, M. (2013).

(2013).This qualitative study explored the experiences of 10 ethnically diverse LGBT youth (ages 18–25 years old) as they transitioned out of the child welfare system and attempted to obtain housing, employment and education. The study also examined participants’ perceptions about the preparation and support they received for transitioning out of care. Respondents indicated that a lack of previous experience made it difficult to achieve employment and relegated them to low-paying jobs. Study participants suggested topics that they felt were not adequately covered as part of their transition to adulthood, including learning how to budget, balance a checkbook and pay bills.X X X X XPutting the pieces together for queer youth: A model of integrated assessment of need and program planning Berberet, H.M. (2006).The goal of this article was to emphasize the importance of using a needs assessment process in developing services for LGBTQ youth. The needs assessment revealed contextual data about the housing needs and gaps and barriers in services for LGBTQ youth 12–24 years old, who were living on the streets, in shelters, group homes, foster homes, juvenile justice facilities and other residential organizations. Data were collected from 400 youth and revealed that 17percent of the youth reported having a psychiatric diagnoses and 13 percent had a previous psychiatric hospitalization. Additionally, 90 percent indicated that they dealt drugs to obtain money for food and a place to sleep. Thirty-five percent of the youth reported engaging in survival sex. All of the youth identified housing as one of their top needs but indicated that they did not access local housing programs due to fear of harassment by other youth and their belief that the adult staff would not protect them.X X XAppendix C: Table 2SUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 48 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSRepresenting transgender youth: Learning from Mae’s journeyBevel, G.

These and other rights are protected in the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, First Amendment and Title IX. In this article, through the story of Mae, a transgender youth, the author provides information about transgender youth’s rights, as well as legal tools, practice tips and training resources useful for advocacy and legal practice.XMeeting the needs of GLB youth in residential care settings: A framework for assessing the unique needs of a vulnerable population Block, R.G., & Matthews, J.D. (2008).The purpose of this article was to discuss the benefits of using strengths-based strategies as a client-centered assessment for residential care facilities. Benefits include increased efficacy and efficiency in the assessment process, empowerment, and enhanced rapport between clients and clinicians. The 10 strengths-based assessment guidelines are: 1. Document the story. 2. Support and validate the story. 3. Honor self-determination. 4. Give preeminence to the story. 5. Discover what is needed. 6. Move the assessment toward strengths. 7. Discover uniqueness. 8.  Reach a mutual agreement on the assessment. 9. Avoid blame and blaming. 10.

(2012).The goal of this document was to present findings from a national nonprobability cross-sectional study that examined the willingness of foster mothers (n=304) to parent sexual minority youth. Results revealed that 40 percent of respondents would not be willing to provide foster care to LGBTQ youth under any circumstances. Conversely, 20 percent indicated that they would provide foster care for sexual minority youth if they received a lot of help and 25 percent would be willing to provide foster care without any extra help or support. Level of education and experience as a foster parent were found to be positively and statistically related to willingness to foster. In the literature review, the author also presented several risk factors that confront sexual minority youth including substance abuse, homelessness, health and mental health issues and suicidality.X X XHuman services for low-income and at-risk LGBT populations: An assessment of the knowledge base and research needs Burwick, A., Gates, G., Baumgartner, S., & Friend, D. (2014). The purpose of the fourth chapter of this review was to focus specifically on LGBT populations and the child welfare system. Key findings from the knowledge base revealed that the number and proportion of LGBT youth in foster care are unknown and that they are at higher risk for experiencing childhood maltreatment and placement instability than their non-LGBT peers. Recommended research topics include: 1) exploration of treatment among subgroups of LGBT youth and factors that increase and decrease maltreatment; 2) identification of the number and characteristics of LGBT youth in child welfare and examining the differences in their service experiences and outcomes as compared to their non-LGBT youth and; and 3) assessment of the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving services for LGBT youth in foster care.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 50 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSSupporting your LGBTQ youth: A guide for foster parentsChild Welfare Information Gateway.

(2008).The purpose of this study was to explore foster parents’ concerns about caring for LGB youth. Twenty-five foster parents participated in focus groups where they expressed misconceptions and a general lack of knowledge about this population of youth. This included believing that gay children would molest their other children and not understanding the difference between someone who is gay and one who cross-dresses. The article also highlights how foster parents’ lack of acceptance creates a direct power block, which is defined as any act, event or condition that disrupts an individual’s personal and/or social skills development.

(2011).This document aimed to present findings from the 2011 Midwest study of foster care youth at age 26. On the subset of questions dealing with sexuality, it found that compared to young men, young women were over five times more likely to identify themselves as bisexual or mostly heterosexual. Of female respondents (n= 321), 27.5 percent identified as something other than 100 percent heterosexual. Specifically, 12.8 percent identified as mostly heterosexual, 6.9 percent as bisexual, 0.9 percent as mostly homosexual, 2.8 percent as 100 percent homosexual, 1.9 percent as not sexually attracted to either gender and 2.2 percent selected don't know. For males, (n=251), 7.2 percent identified as something other than 100 percent heterosexual. Specifically, 3.2 percent identified as mostly heterosexual, 0.4 percent as bisexual, 0.4 percent as mostly homosexual, 1.2 percent as 100 percent homosexual, 0.8 percent as not sexually attracted to either gender and 1.2 percent selected don't know.XMidwest evaluation of the adult functioning of former foster youth: Outcomes at age 21Courtney, M.E., Dworsky, A., Ruth, G., Havlicek, J., Perez, A., & Keller, T.

(2011)The purpose of this article was to describe the four-phase Community Needs Assessment (CNA) conducted in Miami-Dade County (MDC), Florida. In phase one, an environmental scan and key informant interviews were conducted. In phase two, there were 10 focus groups with a total of 180 participants. In phase three, a nonrandom sample of 273 LGBTQ youth in MDC completed the Youth Speak Out Survey. In phase four, community feedback was obtained. The article also presented the resulting system of care that was proposed. This included the need for a service continuum, prevention education workshops, youth speaker trainings, youth enrichment events, highly trained care coordinators and weekly community-based group counseling. X X XIssues of shared parenting of LGBTQ children and youth in foster care: Preparing foster parents for new rolesCraig-Oldsen, H., Craig, J.A., & Morton, T. (2006).The aim of this article was to suggest that shared parenting can aid in healthy growth and development in LGBTQ children and youth involved in foster care. Shared parenting occurs when a child is placed in foster care while also maintaining contact with his/her birth parents. The article also highlights the fact that LGBTQ youth face heightened threats to their safety and well-being.X X X XLock in: Interactions with the criminal justice and child welfare systems for LGBTQ youth, YMSM, and YWSW who engage in survival sexDank, M., Yu, L., Yahner, J., Pelletier, E., Mora, M., & Conner, B. (2015).This document aimed to present findings from a three-year study conducted by the Urban Institute. Data were collected from a total of 283 youth who engaged in survival sex (i.e., trading sex to meet basic needs for food and shelter) in New York City (NYC). In-depth interviews were also conducted with 68 professionals from 28 organizations. Interviewees agreed that after the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) 2012 guidelines, New York’s child welfare agencies made improvements but more needs to be done. Interviews revealed that many youth became involved with NYC ACS because of abuse or neglect. Youth noted that placements were often restrictive, disruptive and filled with conflict with staff and peers; ACS-run facilities were large or overcrowded; and they felt criminalized rather than protected by the courts, which led to them engaging in survival sex.X X X X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 54 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSSupporting the emotional and psychological well-being of sexual minority youth: Youth ideas for action Davis, T.S., Saltzburg, S., & Locke, C.R.

Data were collected from 33 youth at two GLB-serving youth centers, one in Ohio and one in Massachusetts. Findings provide practitioners with 61 ideas for meeting their needs. Areas identified included psychological and physical safety, community impact on well-being, schools and psychosocial supports and access to mental health and health care.X X X X XLGBTQ youth in child welfareDecker, J.P. (2011).The goal of this master’s thesis was to present findings from a survey completed by 24 New York-based agencies. Participants identified four attitudes of foster parents: 1) misconceptions, 2) fears of gay children molesting their own children, 3) different perceptions between lesbian or bisexual children compared to gay children; and 4) religious beliefs. Non-discrimination policies were in place at 96 percent of the responding agencies. Only two agencies, or 8 percent of respondents, indicated that cultural diversity training did not include sexual orientation. Qualitative data were also collected through a series of interviews with four leaders in the field of LGBTQ youth in child welfare. Generally, participants indicated that by focusing on the unique needs of their LGBTQ clients, their programs were able to serve the population well.X X XIn the system and in the life: A guide for teens and staff to the gay experience in foster care Desetta, A. (Ed.). (2003).This book aimed to share 19 stories from gay and straight youth. Chapter 1: Out in the Open and Chapter 2: In the System and In the Life contain 14 stories written by LGBTQ youth. Chapter 3: Straight, but Not Narrow-Minded presents five stories by straight youth who came to terms with friends coming out-of-the-closet.

(2012).The goal of this article was to present findings from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) Homeless Youth Provider Survey conducted online from October 2011 to March 2012. A total of 381 respondents completed at least a portion of the survey. This represented 354 agencies from across the United States. Most respondents, 94 percent, reported working with LGBT youth who were runaways or homeless in the past year. Respondents indicated that of their LGBT homeless clients, 65 percent have mental health issues, 53 percent have histories of alcohol and substance abuse, 68 percent faced family rejection, 54 percent faced family abuse and 33 percent had been in foster care. Providers recognized that family rejection and abuse are among the top reasons that LGBT youth face homelessness. Therefore, 58 percent of 266 respondents indicated that their agency provided services around family acceptance or reunification.X X X X XThe economic well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth transitioning out of foster care Dworsky, A. (2013, January).The purpose of this study was to analyze whether there were significant differences between LGB and heterosexual youth transitioning out of foster care. Data from the “Midwest Study” were collected at five times from 2002 to 2011: at age 17 or 18 (n=732), 19 (n=603), 21 (n=591), 23 or 24 (n=602) and 26 (n=596). Economic well-being was analyzed in the areas of housing, education, employment and earnings, benefit receipt, economic hardships, food security and assets and debts. No statistically significant differences were found in the areas of educational attainment or employment and earnings. Nonetheless, employed heterosexual participants averaged $9.04 per hour while LGB participants averaged only $7.82 per hour. There were no statistically significant differences in the areas of benefit receipt or debts and assets.

As a result of these cases, rights have been specified for youth who identify as LGBTQ. These include rights to equal protection, First Amendment rights and specific state-level anti-discrimination laws. A section of the article is devoted to protections specific to transgender youth such as the right to access appropriate medical care.X XLGBT youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems: Charting a way forwardFedders, B.

It also discusses the significance of recent legal and policy changes and offers thoughts about how gender and sexual equality can result in reduced numbers of youth in the system. It finds that strides are being made in education, organizing and litigation. For instance, litigation has been brought by the ACLU and other organizations who seek to close the gap in service and treatment of individuals who identify as LGBTQ.

It also presents estimates that 20–40 percent of all homeless youth are LGBTQ. The data also indicate that LGB RHY are more likely to be subjected to sexual victimization when compared with heterosexual youth and they are more likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder.

The sample of 30 LGBTQ young adults resided at Trinity Place Shelter in New York City from September 2009 to December 2011. Participants were mostly male with females being underrepresented. More than one-quarter were transgender, a third were gay and under a third were bisexual. Almost half had been ejected from their childhood home, with 15 percent indicating it was due to sexual orientation or gender identity. Several issues were highlighted including reasons for exit from home of origin, abuse and victimization, sexual risk behaviors, physical and mental health, suicidal ideation and attempts, substance use and resilience.

Interviews were conducted with staff of congregate care settings, professionals including judges and former foster care youth. Three themes that emerged were: congregate care settings were not appropriate for LGBTQ youth; the needs of these youth were often ignored even in settings where staff showed concern for youth in their care; and a concern for safety of all youth including those who identified themselves as LGBTQ.

(2011).This study presented a subset of gender identity and sexual orientation data from 188 youth interviewed using the Casey Field Office Mental Health Study (CFOMH). Ten respondents self-identified as LGBTQ and their narrative data were also presented. LGBTQ youth felt more comfortable sharing their sexual orientation with their peers than with their social workers and parents. In addition, they were more comfortable revealing their sexual orientation to their mothers than their fathers. Most of the 10 LGBTQ respondents felt supported by the Casey staff at the time of the study but not necessarily during the “coming out” process. While the 188 respondents who did not identify as LGBTQ youth indicated that they were comfortable and friendly with LGBTQ youth they were aware of situations where they were harassed because they identified as LGBTQ.X XAssessing LGBTQ youth cultural competency in direct-care behavioral health workers: Development and validation of a measureGandy, M.E. (2015).The goal of this study was to assess the validity of the LGBTQ Youth Cultural Competency (LGBTQY-CC) scale. A total of 131 professionals completed the scale and a reduced, 27-item, instrument was then created. The new instrument correlated with gay affirmative practice, beliefs about sexual minorities and transphobia. However, it was not significantly influenced by social desirability. Regression analysis revealed that scores on the LGBTQY-CC could be predicted by age, political ideology, personal social contact with LGBTQ individuals and religious ideology.X X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 59 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSToward providing a welcoming home for all: Enacting a new approach to address the longstanding problems lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth face in the foster care systemGilliam, J.W., Jr. (2004).This article aimed to investigate the constitutionality of programs that attempt to match LGBT youth with adults of similar sexual orientation. The article states that LGBT youth already face violations of their constitutional rights. They do not have equal protection and have difficulty finding appropriate placements. The article concludes that sexual orientation can be used as a matching category similar to what has been used to match youth to placements with adults of similar race or similar religious beliefs.X X X XTraining needs of Ventura County Children’s Services staff regarding gay and lesbian issues of adolescents in foster care Hruska, R. (2001). This document aimed to highlight findings from data collected from 53 staff members of Ventura County Children and Family Services. The researcher noted that a limitation of the study was the “invisibility” of gay and lesbian youth in child welfare. For that reason, practitioners may be underrepresenting the number of lesbian and gay youth that they serve. A majority of respondents (64.2 percent) believed there were not enough gay and lesbian support services. When highlighting problems faced by gay and lesbian youth, 84.2 percent indicated that depression is a problem and the same percentage indicated that anxiety was a problem. Substance abuse was seen as a problem by 58.0 percent of respondents. Over half (63.2 percent) had worked with youth who had suicidal ideation or suicide attempts.

Youth of seven different juvenile detention centers were surveyed. Two hundred youth participated in the study. Results showed that LGBQ/GNCT youth in the juvenile justice system were at least three times more likely to have been removed from their homes and at least five times more likely to have been in a group or foster home when compared to their straight and gender-conforming peers.

(2006).This article aimed to discuss issues surrounding permanency and LGBTQ youth. The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) found that youth in congregate care were less likely to have family connections compared with their peers in other types of care. They were more likely to have little to no contact with their biological parents and were more likely to have their visits canceled by their caregivers. This finding is particularly concerning because research indicates that LGBTQ youth are more likely to be placed in group foster care facilities. The article suggests that reunification should be the first permanency option. If that is not possible, then advocates must work to identify and secure other placements.X XOpening doors for LGBTQ youth in foster care Khoury, A.

Its focus is on how strong relationships can allow lawyers to advocate for their LGBT clients. Although knowing a youth's LGBTQ status may seem unimportant and not germane to the issues, it may be a pivotal issue surrounding why the youth was in care. It can also determine the type of care that he/she will receive in placement whether in group homes or in foster care. Lawyers can build strong relationships by being open to listening, being nonjudgmental, using non-gender-specific language, having LGBTQ-friendly posters and stickers and maintaining confidentiality.X XGetting down to basics: Tools to support LGBTQ youth in careLambda Legal & Child Welfare League of America.

It covers topics directed at youth, so they are aware of their legal rights; families, so they understand the impact of family acceptance; and caseworkers, so they know how to prepare youth for a healthy transition to adulthood. The document also presents the challenges that LGBTQ youth are often confronted with in congregate care, including increased risk for sexual abuse.X X XExploring attitudes about LGBTQ youth in foster careLaver, M.

It discusses the Riddle Homophobia Scale, which identifies four negative and four positive levels of attitudes toward lesbian and gay people and same-sex relationships. They are: 1) repulsion, 2) pity, 3) tolerance and 4) acceptance. The article suggests that even if they have negative feelings about LGBTQ youth, professional responsibilities require that judges and lawyers create nurturing environments for these youth.XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 63 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSLegal advocacy and decision making for LGBTQ youthLaver, M.

It notes that finding permanent homes for LGBTQ youth can be facilitated when lawyers and judges use best practices. For instance, the youth should have a role in the courtroom. The lawyer can also advocate in the school system and if necessary advocate for the youth’s proper treatment in the juvenile justice system. Lawyers can also help youth navigate health care systems, particularly with finding providers who are sensitive to their needs.XA psycho-educational program for parents and caregivers of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth in foster care: A grant proposal Laza, L.

The purpose of this master’s thesis was to establish parenting classes for parents and caregivers of LGBTQ youth within the Department of Children and Family Services of Los Angeles County’s regional office. The three primary objectives would be: 1) reunification for LGBTQ youth or a permanent home with loving caregivers, 2) increasing the knowledge of foster parents and group home staff and 3) providing a safe and respectful environment in which parents and caregivers could learn about the needs of LGBTQ youth.XLesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth needs and services [PowerPoint] (n.d.).Unknown The aim of this PowerPoint presentation was to focus on LGBTQ youth in the state of Delaware. One slide focused on LGBTQ youth in child welfare and highlighted findings by the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services. It estimated that between 20-40 percent of homeless youth are LGBTQ and that 78 percent of LGBTQ youth were removed or ran away from their foster placements as a result of hostility toward their sexual orientation or gender identity. Lack of reunification or permanency often resulted in LGBTQ youth losing connections to their communities and families of origin. The PowerPoint also noted that rather than receiving educational, physical and mental health services LGBTQ youth are often barred from accessing these services. It suggests that safe spaces should be created. In addition, agencies can use paraphernalia such as banners and posters to show LGBTQ youth that they are welcome.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 64 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSA room of one’s own: Safe placement for transgender youth in foster careLove, A.

Youth-on-youth violence is prevalent against transgender youth and, unfortunately, staff who work in congregate care settings often do not effectively protect them. A study implemented in 2011 with over 6,000 transgender individuals revealed that 78 percent reported being harassed in K-12 education. Over half of the respondents, 55 percent, indicated that they were harassed by staff when trying to access a homeless shelter.X XGay and no place to go: Assessing the needs of gay and lesbian adolescents in out-of-home care settingsMallon, G.P.

One of its programs, the Triangle Tribe, is an initiative that empowers adults to work together with gay, lesbian and bisexual youth ages 12–21 years old in out-of-home care. The group has worked to create programs and initiatives that meet the needs of youth by focusing not on repairing, but on developing the youth.

Developed by Green Chimneys in New York City, the three-hour workshop trains 15–20 participants through lectures, role plays, video presentations, small group discussions and question-and-answer periods. Participants learn about appropriate language and why youth prefer the term gay, lesbian or bisexual rather than the medically based term \"homosexual,\" now generally regarded by the LGBTQ community as offensive. Developmental needs, the coming out process, LGBTQ youth and the child welfare system and creating nurturing environments are also discussed.XThe delivery of child welfare services to gay and lesbian adolescentsMallon, G.P.

While in the program youth completed a Life Skills Assessment (LSA) initially, semiannually and at discharge. They also participated in a weekly life skills course and in two weekly individual counseling sessions, one with a social worker and one with a life skills coordinator. The study was conducted on all youth discharged from the program to live independently from December 1987 to December 1994. A total of 46 participants were identified — all were male, 96 percent were of color and 13, or over one-quarter, identified as gay. For the study, the LSA was analyzed and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 43 of the 46 former clients.

The first theme, fear for one’s personal safety led to hiding was confirmed by 78 percent of youth and 88 percent of professionals. Second was verbal harassment at home. Third was the ‘‘garbage’’ metaphor where the young people felt that they were \"throw away\" children or that they were always being \"dumped on\" by their family members. The fourth theme was verbal harassment from foster and adoptive parents. Theme five was verbal harassment from peers.

It found that these young people are marginalized not only by society but also by their families. Lack of familial support often results in the youth leaving home. When this occurs, reunification is frequently not an option. Therefore, child welfare professionals must gain greater expertise in viable strategies that support gay and lesbian youth. Workers need training on how to educate and sensitize birth families and foster families. Recruitment efforts should keep in mind that successful outcomes have been shown when these youth are placed with foster parents who are also gay or lesbian.X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 68 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSPermanency for LGBTQ youth Mallon, G.P. (2011).The purpose of this article was to explore the challenges of providing permanency for LGBTQ youth. The author states that LGBTQ youth in foster care need a range of mental and physical health services, and that they are often the target of violence, harassment and discrimination from peers, caregivers and group care facility staff. They are often placed in group care, including psychiatric facilities because of limited available placement resources. In a prior research study completed by the author, it was found that the average number of placements for LGBTQ youth was 6.35 due to staff members not accepting the youth’s sexual orientation, youth not feeling safe and them not being accepted by their peers because of their sexual orientation. The author proposes preservation of the youth’s relationship with his/her family of origin as the first permanency option to be considered.

These include community-based preventive service and program models and training for sensitive practice. To effectively serve LGBTQ youth and their families, professionals must first acknowledge that they have clients who are LGBT. The larger society must also recognize that heterocentrically oriented and heterosexually controlled systems ignore the existence of LGBTQ youth and their families. Public- and private-sector providers must recognize that families have to be supported so that separation is avoided.X XA place of respect: A guide for group care facilities serving transgender and gender non-conforming youthMarksamer, J. (2011).The goal of this guide was to present not only recommendations but also legal requirements for organizations serving transgender and gender nonconforming youth. It presents solutions for nine common problems facing transgender and gender nonconforming youth. For instance, instead of showing lack of respect and support for youth’s gender identity and expression, staff should acknowledge, respect and support them by allowing young people to express the gender identify they choose. Placements must also be appropriate and verbal harassments, threats and violence must not be tolerated. The guide also notes that isolating the transgender or gender nonconforming youth is not an acceptable solution to prevent other youth from being abusive or violent. Staff should also advocate at off-site school settings and find resources and mentors in the community.X X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 70 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSOut of the shadows: Supporting LGBTQ youth in child welfareMartin, M., Down, L., & Erney, R.

X X X X X XImproving outcomes for LGBT youth in out-of-home care settings Matarese, M. (2012).This book chapter aimed to show that a disproportionately high number of children in the child welfare system identify as LGBTQ. This suggests that they are more likely to be removed from their homes or to run away from home than their non-LGBTQ peers. Child welfare organizations are frequently unable or unwilling to fully meet the needs of LGBTQ children and youth. Myths include the perception that LGBTQ youth are sexual offenders who will prey on other youth. Additionally, organizations believe that there are no LGBTQ youth among their clients so they do not need to meet the needs of these youth. These attitudes add to the reasons why LGBTQ youth hide their sexual identities.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 71 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSSexual and gender minority disproportionality and disparities in child welfare: A population-based studyMcCormick, A., Schmidt, K., & Terrazas, S.R.

A total of 26 participants completed 60–90 minute in-depth, semi-structured, qualitative interviews on their experiences with foster families. In accepting families, respondents felt their foster families worked to advocate on their behalf when mistreatment occurred in the home or at school. In addition, accepting families made efforts to connect youth with affirming peers and had positive approaches to romantic relationships.

Due to their pursuit of higher education, these youth were considered as a sample of resilient foster care youth. Participants were invited by email to participate in a 20-minute online survey. Findings on the Trauma Related Beliefs Questionnaire indicated that sexual minority youth were significantly more likely to suffer sexual abuse than their heterosexual peers. In addition, sexual minority youth had higher levels of self-blame than heterosexual youth.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 73 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSRevolving doors: LGBTQ youth at the interface of the child welfare and juvenile justice systemsMountz, S.

Part I: LGBTQ Youth in the Foster Care System focuses on LGBTQ Pathways to the Child Welfare System. Part II: The Revolving Door: Onto the Streets and Into the Juvenile Justice System discusses the intersection between child welfare, the juvenile justice system and homelessness. Part III: Future Policy and Practice Reforms and the Call for an Intersectional Lens suggests that policymakers, agencies and practitioners take a deeper and more systematic look at how they operate because all forms of oppression should be addressed and overcome.X X X XParenting program for biological and foster parents of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth involved in the child welfare system: A grant proposal Moya, L. (2011). This document aimed to secure funding for parenting classes to improve the ability of parents to deal with issues faced by LGBTQ youth. This study highlighted findings that LGBTQ youth are at risk of maltreatment in their families of origin and in the child welfare system. In addition, to escape these situations, LGBTQ youth are at higher risk of experiencing homelessness. Research indicates that when parents support their LGBTQ youth the child is less likely to experience negative outcomes.X X XMoving the margins: Training curriculum for child welfare services with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth in out-of-home careNational Association of Social Workers. (2009).The goal of this train-the-trainer curriculum was to build the awareness, skills and capacity of social workers and other child welfare practitioners to serve LGBTQ youth in out-of-home-care settings. The curriculum is divided into two sections, each with six submodules: LGBTQ 101: An Overview of LGBTQ Youth in Out-of-Home Care; and LGBTQ 201: Issues for Youth in Out-of-Home Care. The curriculum also includes sample agendas and PowerPoint presentations. As part of the training, participants are informed of the significance of family acceptance and the data describing the harassment and discriminatory treatment that LGBTQ youth face in out-of-home-care. In one study presented in the curriculum, it was revealed that 90 percent of youth said that safety was a concern in group homes and shelters.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 74 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSReaching higher: Facilitator’s curriculum guide and participant handoutsNational Center for Child Welfare Excellence.

The researchers analyzed foster care and abuse histories. Results revealed that 28 percent of participants had been in foster care in the past. Half of the youth reported prior physical, emotional and verbal abuse. Thirty-three percent reported being sexually abused in the past. X XLGBT populations and the child welfare system: A snapshot of the knowledge base and research needsOffice of Planning, Research & Evaluation.(2015).The goal of this brief was to provide a summary of the knowledge base and research needs regarding LGBT people and child welfare. It covered four topics: 1) the risk of child maltreatment for LGBT individuals; 2) the child welfare experiences of LGBT people; 3) the effectiveness of child welfare programs for LGBT youth in foster care; and 4) LGBT adults’ participation as foster or adoptive parents in the child welfare system. Research is recommended to identify individual, family or community characteristics that increase or decrease youth’s risk of maltreatment. Additionally, research is needed to fully examine the participation, experiences and the post-care lives of LGBT youth in the child welfare system, including the extent of differences in outcomes when compared with their non-LGBT peers. To examine the effectiveness of child welfare services, the authors recommend studies examining the extent to which child welfare agencies are implementing efforts to improve services for this population of youth.

Data show that due to a shortage of foster and adoptive families willing to provide homes to LGBTQ youth they are most often placed in congregate care settings that are not safe for them. The two organizations propose a national advocacy effort calling for actions to secure safe and inclusive homes for LGBTQ youth. Proposed actions include passing federal legislation prohibiting sexual orientation and gender identify discrimination by foster agencies receiving taxpayer funding and mandating LGBTQ cultural competency training for youth service providers. At the time of the press release, only 13 states and the District of Columbia had explicit laws or policies in place to protect LGBTQ foster youth from discrimination.XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 82 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSKids, courts, and queers: Lesbian and gay youth in the juvenile justice and foster care systems Sullivan, C.

It also presents specific cases, such as the Matter of Lori M. in which a mother unsuccessfully sought a petition to have her daughter designated as a P.I.N.S. (Person In Need of Supervision) because she was associating with a lesbian who was 21 years old. P.I.N.S. are defined as a male under 16 years of age and a female under 18 years of age who are habitually disobedient and who cannot be lawfully controlled by their parents. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely to enter the foster care system as the result of a P.I.N.S. petition.

(2014, November 7).This is an archived presentation of the findings from interviews of 21 former foster care gay and lesbian youth, 18–25 years of age in Texas, Iowa and Illinois about foster family acceptance. There were differences in treatment of the youth when comparing rejecting and accepting families. Youth in accepting families received family support when they were bullied or mistreated as compared to rejecting families who placed blamed for harassment on the LGBTQ youth. Also in rejecting families, there were double standards in terms of romantic relationships, with foster families accepting those relationships with heterosexual youth. The development of policies addressing issues of the double standard is recommended. Respondents indicated that an ideal foster family is accepting, nonjudgmental and value people’s differences.X X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 84 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSRural social workers’ perceptions of training needs for working with LGBTQ-identified youth in the foster care system Toner, J.

The study explored the knowledge, perceptions and training needs for working with LGBTQ youth in foster care. Prior research has shown rural areas tend to be less tolerant of sexual diversity and more conservative. There were three research questions: 1) What is the level of knowledge of issues with youth identifying as LGBTQ in the foster system? 2) What are workers’ perceptions of current services for this population?, and 3) What is their perception of training needs for working effectively with this population? Respondents felt foster families did not have adequate knowledge about LGBTQ youth and available parenting-focused resources were scarce. A self-assessment of workers’ knowledge revealed gaps as well. Participants recommended mandated training for workers and foster families.X X XThe Lesbian, Gay & Bisexual Youth Program (LGBYP): A model for communities seeking to improve quality of life for lesbian, gay and bisexual youthTravers, R., & Paoletti, D.

The guide notes LGBTQ youth are at increased risk for emotional, physical and sexual abuse and that protecting them is an urgent need. It also finds these youth are overrepresented, comprising up to 20 percent of detained youth, and youth of color are overrepresented in the intersection of race, LGBTQ-status and juvenile justice involvement.

One view was that placing youth in LGBTQ group homes is safer than placing them in traditional congregate care. The counterpoint emphasized that LGBTQ-only settings create experiences that are not reflective of the real world, including what youth may encounter in school and in society at large. They further suggest that all programs throughout the child welfare system become places where LGBTQ youth are safe and welcomed.X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 88 -ARTICLE AUTHOR DESCRIPTION EMPIRICAL STUDYTHE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL AND FAMILY ACCEPTANCEHARASSMENT, ABUSE AND NEGATIVE TREATMENTRESULTING RISKS AND VULNERABILITIESTRANSGENDER YOUTH INCLUDEDRACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES FOCUSLGBTQ youth permanencyYarbrough, J. (2012).This is an information packet developed by the National Resource Center for Permanency and Family Connections. It describes the negative experiences that confront LGBTQ youth in the child welfare system. For example, foster parents may pressure youth to suppress or change their sexual identities and may even return them to agencies. Agency staff accommodate these families by not placing LGBTQ youth with them. This limits the permanency resources available for these youth and they often prefer living on the streets to dealing with harassment, violence, rejection and a system that perpetuates their oppression. For example, a study by the Urban Justice Center revealed 78 percent of youth reported being removed or running away from placements due to hostility expressed toward them about their sexual- or gender-identity.X XSUPPORTING LITER ATURE- 89 -701  ST.
