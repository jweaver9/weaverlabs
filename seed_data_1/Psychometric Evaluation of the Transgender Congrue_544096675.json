Zachary Huit,  zach.huit@gmail.comAbstract Introduction Despite increased attention to transgender and gender diverse (TGD) issues in psychological literature during the past decade, gaps remain for psycho-metric validation of TGD-specific measures. Kozee et al. (Psychology of Women Quarterly 36(2):179–196, 2012) addressed such gaps by creating the Transgen-der Congruence Scale (TCS), measuring gender acceptance and feelings of gen-der congruence between internal and external attributes across a broad range of gender identities. The current study extended Kozee and colleagues’ work by further examining the psychometric properties of the TCS. Methods Between October and November of 2017, 210 transmasculine, transfemi-nine, and gender diverse adults between ages 19 and 73 completed online surveys digitalcommons.unl.eduPublished in Sexuality Research and Social Policy (2021)doi:10.1007/s13178-021-00659-7 Copyright © 2021 by the authors; published by Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      2containing demographic, gender identity-specific, and well-being measures in-cluding the TCS. Results Results of confirmatory factor analysis replicated the original two-factor model (Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity Acceptance), with the elim-ination of two poorly loading items, resulting in a 10-item reduced model (TCS-10). Higher scores on TCS-10 were associated with positive scores on gender-re-lated well-being, congruence, and pride, positive affect, and life satisfaction, as well as lower scores on gender-related dysphoria, non-affirmation, internalized transphobia, and marginalization. There were modest but significant associations between Gender Identity Congruence and both depression and negative affect. Conclusions Despite limitations of sample size and diversity of identities, the study reaffirmed the utility of the TCS as an overall construct of gender identity con-gruence with a 10-item reduced structure related to other established TGD constructs. Policy Implications Though socio-political climate is the ultimate domain for alle-viating TGD stigma and discrimination, factors such as gender congruence are essential areas of focus to foster resiliency.  Keywords: Transgender, Gender diverse, Identity formation, Psychometrics, Measurement, Well-being  Transgender and gender diverse1 (TGD) communities have histori-cally been underrepresented in research contexts, often being com-bined with samples of sexual minority participants, masking any dis-tinct findings for TGD participants. However, in more recent years, TGD people have received growing attention in empirical studies. A Google Scholar search on October 6, 2020, specifying “Transgender” in the title, yielded over 3,630 results between the years of 2011 and 2014, almost tripling in number between 2015 and 2020 with over 11,900 results. Despite this increase in attention, there remain areas for further growth and salient gaps in knowledge, including recogniz-ing the diversities of gender identities and a lack of validated assess-ment instruments for key TGD-related constructs.    Research has often perpetuated the exclusion of many TGD peo-ple by failing to capture gender outside of the male/ female binary, or by forcing people to select “other” if the binary designation does not 1 Although some of the cited literature in this paper uses the term non-binary or gender non-conforming, at the recommendation of our Local Community Board, we will refer to those identifying as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth, but outside of male–female dichotomies, as gender diverse.Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      3fit. An additional critique of TGD-related studies is the overemphasis on gender transition, furthering the misperception that all TGD in-dividuals wish to pursue gender affirmation procedures and failing to recognize the individual nature of TGD identities and experiences (Benson, 2013; Puckett et al., 2018). Given that TGD communities are heterogeneous and have many intersectional identities and experi-ences (de Vries, 2012; Kuper et al., 2012), assumptions of gender bi-nary and desires for transition perpetuate stigma and exclude a range of TGD people (Chang & Chung, 2015). In the current study, TGD re-fers to a broad range of gender diversity, excluding cisgender people, and including anyone identifying as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth. Another salient gap in TGD literature is the lack of validated and reliable measurements of TGD-specific constructs. In their review, Shulman et al. (2017) identified eight TGD-specific measures, noting that even those measures had limited evidence of their psychomet-ric properties outside of the original publication. Furthermore, many measures used with TGD individuals adapt previously established con-structs and measures rather than starting with TGD experiences. For example, the Transgender Stigma Scale (Mizock & Mueser, 2014) was adapted from a measure of mental illness stigma (King et al., 2007). While such an approach serves as a short-term practical solution to the dearth of TGD-specific measures, the experiences of TGD individu-als may not be fully captured by these adaptations (Hope et al., 2016). Rather, what is needed is specific measurement development and val-idation with TGD samples. Kozee et al. (2012) addressed these major issues by creating the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS) to assess how TGD people eval-uate their personal acceptance of their gender and how closely their gender expression aligns with their identity. They defined transgen-der congruence as “the degree to which transgender individuals feel genuine, authentic, and comfortable within their external appearance/ presence and accept their genuine identity rather than the socially prescribed identity” (p. 181). The constructs that they cite as impor-tant are the following: (a) clarity in identifying their gender (“Self-Image”); (b) how congruent they perceive their internal and external representations of gender (“Self-Reflection”); and (c) ability to ex-press gender (“Self-Expression”). Kozee et al. (2012) indicated that Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      4these constructs were designed to be more inclusive of gender diver-sity outside of binary identities and experiences. The initial validation study of the TCS was conducted in two phases by Kozee et al. (2012). In the first phase, a team of academic research-ers developed and refined items. These items were rated by four TGD individuals who deemed the 15 retained items as indicative of the desired content and sufficient in clarity. A sample of 162 TGD peo-ple between the ages of 18 and 75 completed a battery of assess-ments including the 15-item TCS and other measures of life meaning and satisfaction, body satisfaction, anxiety, depression, social desir-ability, and an inventory to assess the participants’ steps in aligning their gender expression with their gender identity. Exploratory fac-tor analysis yielded a final 14-item scale, with two factors, named Ap-pearance Congruence (external appearance) and Gender Identity Ac-ceptance (self-acceptance). This structure was further examined in the second phase of the validation using confirmatory factor analy-sis (CFA) among a sample of 342 TGD participants between the ages of 18 and 72. The results of the second study indicated a reduction of items to a 12-item scale, while retaining the original two-factor solu-tion. Additionally, they found higher scores on these factors related to greater life meaning and satisfaction, as well as lower anxiety and depression. Other research has also supported the construct validity of the TCS (Chodzen et al., 2019; Jackman et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2019a; McLemore, 2015; van den Brink et al., 2019). TCS scores are negatively related to frequency of misgendering experiences, depres-sion, negative affect, nonsuicidal self-injury, and rumination about gender identity; conversely, TCS scores are positively related to self-esteem (appearance and social), gender congruence, and life satisfac-tion, as well as overall quality of life. Internal consistency for the TCS tends to be good (Cronbach’s a ranging from 0.79 to 0.96). Although this growing body of work has addressed important gaps in TGD research related to gender diversity and helped rectify the dearth of empirically supported constructs that can be reliably as-sessed, some important gaps remain. First, Kozee et al. (2012) desired to capture a broader range of gender diversity outside of binary con-structs (e.g., transgender man, transgender woman), but there was a limited proportion of individuals in their initial samples who strictly identified as gender diverse, without also identifying in a transgender Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      5category (only 6 out of 162 for study 1 and 22 of 342 for study 2). While they found no significant differences in factor structure between those identifying as binary and gender diverse, limited group size may have dampened some of those differences. Jones et al. (2019b) simi-larly found no differences in Appearance Congruence between gender diverse and binary transgender participants; however, this was among a larger cisgender sample with a smaller proportion of transgender and gender diverse participants. Second, the employment of the TCS has varied regarding use of only the Appearance Congruence subscale, both subscales, or only the total TCS score, making direct compari-sons more challenging. Finally, despite the broad implementation of the TCS, no other studies to date have examined other psychometric properties such as factor structure of the scale since the original val-idation study (Kozee et al., 2012).  As such, the purpose of the current study was to replicate and ex-tend the original psychometric evaluation of the TCS using confirma-tory factor analysis with an additional sample of TGD people, includ-ing a larger proportion of individuals identifying with genders outside of the binary. Since Kozee et al. (2012), a number of validated TGD-specific measures have been published and prominent general mea-sures of mental health and well-being have been used extensively with TGD samples to support their validity. This provides new opportuni-ties to further evaluate the psychometric properties of the TCS that were not available to Kozee et al. (2012), building on their ground-breaking work. Overall, we hypothesized that we would replicate and extend the original validation study for the TCS. Specifically, we hypothesized that the TCS would be internally consistent, and the original two-fac-tor solution would be replicated in the new data set. Also, we hypothe-sized that greater gender congruence (total score, appearance congru-ence, and gender identity acceptance) would be associated with higher well-being on TGD-specific measures (i.e., higher scores on gender-re-lated functioning and gender pride; lower scores on gender-related dysphoria, discrimination, rejection, victimization, non-affirmation, internalized transphobia, negative expectations for the future, and nondisclosure of gender identity), and better overall well-being (i.e., lower ratings of anxiety, depression, and negative affect; greater rat-ings of positive affect and life satisfaction). Lastly, we expected that Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      6while there may be slight differences for TCS scores between binary and diverse gender categories, there would be no significant mean dif-ferences in TCS scores between those who identify as transfeminine, transmasculine, and gender diverse. Methods Participants Two hundred and ten TGD individuals completed a battery of on-line questionnaires, including the TCS. Participants were between 19 and 73 years old (M = 29.93, SD = 9.42). Sixty-one people (29%) had unknown ages; however, they confirmed that they were over the age of 19 per study inclusion criteria (with 19 being Nebraska’s legal age of majority). Participants described their gender identity via an open response box as well as selecting one of three set cate-gories. For the set categories, 74 (35.2%) participants identified as transwoman/trans woman/MTF (male-to-female)/woman, 75 partic-ipants (35.7%) as transman/trans man/FTM (female-to- male)/man, and 46 (21.9%) as nonbinary/gender nonconforming/ genderqueer/agender/bigender/another gender minority in the fixed categories. For brevity, these groups will be referred to as transfeminine, trans-masculine, and gender diverse, respectively. Fifteen (7.1%) partici-pants did not choose from the fixed options. Additionally, the free re-sponse field yielded a broad range of identities that formed too many categories for meaningful statistical analysis. There was a diverse representation of sexual orientation among participants: 95 (45.2%) identifying as heterosexual, 32 (15.2%) as gay, 21 (10%) as bisexual, 16 (7.6%) as lesbian, 15 (7.1%) as queer-identified, 6 (2.9%) as pan-sexual, and 4 participants (1.9%) as asexual. Five (2.4%) described their sexual orientation in a different manner, and 16 (7.6%) did not respond to sexual orientation. A majority of respondents identified as European American/ Cau-casian/White (n = 157, 74.8%). Twelve (5.7%) identified as African American/Black, 11 (5.2%) as Native American/American Indian/Alas-kan Native, 6 (2.9%) as Asian American/Pacific Islander, 9 (4.3%) as Latino/a/x, and 9 (4.3%) as Hispanic. Eleven (5.2%) identified as Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      7more than one race/ethnicity. Two (1%) opted to describe their ra-cial/ ethnic identity in another way, and 16 (7.6%) did not respond to racial/ethnic identity. Procedures Participants were recruited via emails to listservs for LGBTQIA+ na-tional organizations in the USA, as well as social media postings. Par-ticipants were directed to an anonymous link to a Qualtrics survey, with all data collection procedures occurring between October and No-vember of 2017. TGD-identified participants over the age of 19 were asked to participate in the online study with a compensation of $10. Those who accessed the survey link confirmed that they were over the age of 19, identified as TGD, and consented to participation before they were able to access the survey. Individuals completed questionnaires regarding demographic in-formation, general mental health, gender-related constructs, and the TCS. Order of administration of measures was randomized to reduce order effects. Participants also completed two additional measures that are not a part of the current analysis (Obasi, 2016). The data in the current analyses were collected as part of another study that was aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Trans Collabora-tions Clinical Check-in ( TC3; Holt et al., 2019). Those who completed the survey were electronically delivered a $10 online gift card within 24 hours after completing the survey if they provided an email ad-dress to receive the gift card (all email addresses were deleted follow-ing payment). The flow of participant self-selection and exclusion is detailed in Fig. 1. Qualtrics metadata and demographic information were exam-ined for duplicate responses, and only those who did not complete the TCS were excluded from the data set. There was no indication of duplicate responses after the removal of those who did not complete any of the included measures in the survey, in addition to those who did  not complete the TCS items specifically. The remainder of partic-ipants retained for analysis were determined to be valid, individual responses. The mean completion time of the participants retained for analysis was 115 min (median = 23.78, SD = 511.75). There is a wide variability in completion time due to inclusion of participants that Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      8partially completed the survey battery but left it open, as the exclu-sion criterion in the current study was for non-completion of the TCS specifically. Among the various lengths for survey completion, there was adequate completion for most of the measures used in the cur-rent study and any remaining missing data were accounted for on a pairwise basis during analyses. Measures Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS; Kozee et al., 2012) The TCS is a 12-item scale containing two subscales: Appearance Con-gruence and Gender Identity Acceptance that measure aspects of con-gruence between external appearance and gender identity, as well as acceptance of gender identity, respectively. The measure was slightly adapted, with the authors’ permission, to capture the individual’s ex-periences over the prior 2-week period by changing each item to past tense. This change was made to better fit the timeframe for some of the other measures. Such adaptations have demonstrated utility Fig. 1 Flow of participants through recruitment to data analysesHuit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      9in previous applications such as a weekly assessment version of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Stoeber & Bittencourt, 1998). Higher scores indicate greater external congruence and acceptance of gender identity. The TCS has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measure (Kozee et al., 2012). Validity and internal consistency of the TCS for the current study are further detailed below. Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Scale (GMSR; Testa et al., 2015) The GMSR is a 58-item scale with 9 subscales that assess the follow-ing: (1) distal marginalization stressors: gender-related discrimination, gender-related rejection, gender-related victimization, non-affirma-tion of gender identity, internalized transphobia; (2) proximal mar-ginalization stressors: negative expectations for future events, non-disclosure (of individual’s gender identity or transition history); and (3) resiliency factors: pride (of individual’s gender identity) and TGD community connectedness. Each of these subscales is independently scored, and higher scores on each indicate greater amount of expe-rience or alignment with the respective domain. The GMSR has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of marginaliza-tion stress and resilience in TGD individuals (Testa et al., 2015). In the current sample, the GMSR demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency on most subscales, with Cronbach’s a ranging from 0.65 to 0.84. However, TGD community connectedness demonstrated poor internal consistency (a = 0.48); thus, it was not included in the cur-rent analysis.  Gender Preoccupation and Stability Questionnaire (GPSQ; Hakeem et al., 2016) The GPSQ is a 14-item scale that assesses the importance, thoughts, and comfort of individual gender identity, as well as stability of one’s sense of identity, and desire for medical gender affirmation. Higher scores indicate greater gender dysphoria. The GPSQ has been dem-onstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of gender dyspho-ria (Hakeem et al., 2016). The GPSQ demonstrated acceptable inter-nal consistency (a = 0.76) in the current sample. Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      10Trans Collaborations Clinical Check-In ( TC3; Holt et al., 2019) The TC3 is an 18-item scale of overall, everyday experiences of TGD in-dividuals including confidence in handling marginalization, social sup-port, comfort with primary and secondary physical sex characteristics, gender presentation, and disclosure of gender identity. Higher scores indicate better functioning and comfort with gender identity. The TC3 has been demonstrated to be valid and reliable (Holt et al., 2019). The TC3 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (a = 0.77) in the current sample. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001) The PHQ-9 is a 9-item scale that assesses depressive symptomatol-ogy. Higher scores indicate greater depression. The PHQ-9 has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of depressive symptoms (Kroenke et al., 2001) and has previously demonstrated high internal consistency in TGD samples (Bradford et al., 2019). The PHQ-9 demonstrated good internal consistency (a = 0.82) in the cur-rent sample. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006) The GAD-7 is a 7-item scale that assesses generalized anxiety, but also has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (Kroenke et al., 2007). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The GAD-7 has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of anxiety symptoms (Löwe et al., 2008) and has previously demonstrated in-ternal consistency in TGD samples (Bradford et al., 2019). The GAD-7 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (a = 0.79) in the cur-rent sample. Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988) The PANAS contains two subscales: Positive Affect and Negative Af-fect which measure dimensions of mood states. Higher scores indicate Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      11greater positive or negative affect on their respective scales. The PA-NAS has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement of affective symptoms (Crawford & Henry, 2004) and various adap-tations of the scale have previously been used in TGD samples (Brad-ford et al., 2019; McLemore, 2015). The PANAS demonstrated accept-able internal consistency for positive affect (a = 0.76) and for negative affect (a = 0.85) in the current sample. Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS; Diener et al., 1985) The SWLS is a 5-item measure of life satisfaction as per global judge-ments by the individual. Higher scores suggest greater life satisfac-tion. The SWLS has been demonstrated to be a reliable and valid mea-surement of life satisfaction (Pavot et al., 1991) and has previously demonstrated internal consistency within a TGD sample (Barr et al., 2016). The SWLS demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (a = 0.71) in the current sample. Data Analytic Approach To examine the validity of the prior factor structure derived from an exploratory approach, data analyses were conducted in three phases similar to the approach outlined by Schmitt et al. (2018). First, pre-liminary analyses were conducted, and descriptive statistics were ob-tained to determine whether the data met the basic assumptions for latent variable modeling. Relying on results from a Monte Carlo esti-mation for minimum sample size requirements (Wolf et al., 2013), we determined we had an adequate sample size to conduct confirmatory factor analysis of the previous exploratory approach. Second, confirmatory factor analysis was completed using the iden-tified factor structures by Kozee et al. (2012). CFAs were completed using R (Version 3.6; R Core Team, 2018) with the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012). Model fit was assessed using χ2, comparative fit in-dex (CFI), root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), using criteria recommended by Hu and Bentler (1998): CFI ≥ 0.95, RMSEA ≤ 0.05, and SRMR ≤ 0.08. Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      12The third phase of data analysis included re-specifying the model by identifying candidates for removal by examining poorly loading items, modification indices, and items with standardized residual co-variances greater than 2 (Kenny, 2011). Once sufficient factor struc-ture was obtained, correlational analyses were performed using SPSS, Version 22 (IBM Corp. 2013) to assess for convergence and/or di-vergence with other established gender identity-related and mental health-related constructs. Missing data were excluded using pairwise deletion methods to ensure that the majority of data were retained for each participant. This method was chosen as missing data meth-ods, such as multiple imputation, have the potential to artificially skew data, due the possibility that data are not missing at random (Sterne et al., 2009). The new factor structure scores (TCS-10 Total, Appearance Congruence, and Gender Identity Acceptance) were com-pared to TGD-specific domains, including the following: GMSR pride, discrimination, rejection, victimization, non-affirmation, internalized transphobia, negative expectations for the future, and nondisclosure of gender identity; gender-related dysphoria (GPSQ); and gender-re-lated functioning (TC3). They were also compared to general well-be-ing measures, namely depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), positive and negative affect (PANAS), and satisfaction with life (SWLS). Finally, demographic variables (including gender identity categories, gender assigned at birth, and age) were assessed using ANOVA and Pearson’s correlations to understand differences and/or related constructs for the final reduced TCS-10 scores. Results Internal Consistency of Original Factors Examination of Cronbach’s alpha using the original factor structure of the TCS (including the Total Score and the two factors Appearance Congruence Subscale and Gender Identity Acceptance Subscale) indi-cated that the internal consistency of factors was not as strong in the current sample (α = 0.70, α = 0.72, α = 0.49, respectively) com-pared to the original validation study (α = 0.93, α = 0.94, α = 0.77, respectively) (Kozee et al., 2012). In particular, the Gender Identity Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      13Acceptance subscale underperformed as a factor grouping, demon-strating poor internal consistency with the original items still intact. Data Distribution Normality of data distributions was examined. The skewness for in-dividual items was between −0.65 and −0.13, whereas the kurtosis was between −1.12 and −0.57, which fell within the bounds of nor-mality. As the absolute values of skewness were less than 3 and kur-tosis were less than 10, the data were determined to be within accept-able ranges of normality for all three of the original TCS scales (Kline, 2005; Kozee et al., 2012). Confirmatory Factor Analysis Table 2 highlights model-based comparisons among the steps of CFA and item deletions.2 The initial CFA examining the proposed two fac-tor solution evidenced mixed results across model fit indices (χ2 (53) = 99.88, p < 0.001, χ2/df = 1.88, CFI = 0.82, RMSEA = 0.07, 90% CI [0.047–0.082], and SRMR = 0.07). This finding differs from the origi-nal validation study (Kozee et al., 2012) which found their final model to demonstrate adequate fit (χ2 (53) = 167.41, p < 0.001, χ2/df = 3.16, CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.08, and SRMR = 0.04).  As the original model did not perform as well as expected, individ-ual inter-item and item-total correlations were first examined, which revealed that several items demonstrated high correlations with other items as well as weak relationships with the total score (correlations < 0.30; refer to Table 1 for item-total and inter-item correlations). Thus, a systematic approach was employed to determine specific eligibility for item reduction. All modifications were performed iteratively, and each item removed subsequently improved model fit. Item 10 (“I was not proud of my gender identity”) from the Gender Identity Acceptance factor was removed because it had multiple stan-dardized residual covariances greater than 2.0. Following removal 2 In the interest of transparency, please note that in response to feedback from an anonymous reviewer on an earlier version of this manuscript, the data analy-ses were re-conceptualized, leading to retention of additional scale items across two factors.Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      14Table 1 Inter-item and item-total correlations and factor loadings for the original TCS structureTCS inter-item correlation matrix Item  Item Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Item  Corrected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Item-Total1) My outward appearance  represented my gender identity  0.25 0.25 0.36 0.32 0.05 0.21 0.15 0.18 −0.12 0.08 0.19 0.352) I experienced a sense of unity    0.18 0.26 0.39 0.09 0.31 0.14 0.23 −0.08 0.19 0.13 0.39 between my gender identity and my body3) My physical appearance    0.44 0.24 0.19 0.33 0.21 0.24 0.12 0.10 0.12 0.45 adequately expressed my gender identity4) I was generally comfortable     0.32 0.21 0.25 0.16 0.21 0.17 0.14 0.21 0.52 with how others perceived my gender  identity when they look at me5) My physical body represented      0.14 0.17 0.04 0.41 −0.04 0.22 0.02 0.43 my gender identity6) The way my body currently        0.09  0.20  0.18  0.28  0.01  −0.10  0.25 looks did not represent my gender  identity (Reversed)7) I was happy with the way my appearance         0.22  0.19  0.01  0.13  0.13  0.38 expressed my gender identity8) I did not feel that my appearance reflects          0.13  0.04  −0.02  −0.02  0.23 my gender identity (Reversed)9) I felt that my mind and body were           0.00  0.15  0.10  0.38 consistent with one another 10) I was not proud of my gender identity            0.22  0.24  0.14 (Reversed) 11) I was happy that I have the gender identity             0.28  0.28 that I do 12) I had accepted my gender identity              0.24Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      15of this item, a two-factor model composed of eleven items remained measuring acceptance and appearance. The resulting model evidenced improved but mixed results across model fit indices (χ2 (43) = 61.91, p < 0.031, χ2/df = 1.43, CFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.05, 90% CI [0.019, 0.067], and SRMR = 0.06). After examining the standardized resid-ual covariance matrix, item 5 (“My physical body represented my gen-der identity”) from the Appearance Congruence factor was selected for removal as it had three standardized residual covariances greater than 2.0. The resulting model evidenced excellent model fit (χ2 (34) = 33.05, p = 0.51, χ2/df = 0.97, CFI = 1.0, RMSEA = 0.00, 90% CI [0.00, 0.005], and SRMR = 0.05). Thus, the final model was a 10-item solu-tion, retaining the two original factors (Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity Acceptance; refer to Tables 2 and 3).      Convergence/Divergence TGD-Specific Constructs Pearson’s correlations (see Table 4) demonstrated that higher scores on the reduced TCS-10 Total scale, as well as Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity Acceptance subscales, were all associated with higher ratings of gender-related functioning (TC3) and gender-related pride (GMSR). However, for all three scales, the correlations with neg-ative expectations about the future (GMSR) and nondisclosure (GMSR) were all nonsignificant. However, there were some differences in pat-terns of relationships between the total and subscale scores with the remaining constructs.

However, the correlations between TCS-10 Total scores and rejection (GMSR) and victimization (GMSR) were not sig-nificant. Higher TCS-10 Appearance Congruence scores were signifi-cantly associated with lower ratings of gender-related dysphoria and nonaffirmation; however, there were no significant relationships with discrimination, rejection, victimization, nor internalized transphobia. There was also no significant relationship for TCS- 10 Gender Identity Acceptance with non-affirmation of gender identity.

However, for all three TCS-10 scales, there was no significant relationship with anxiety (GAD-7). Again, there were dif-ferences in relationships for the remaining constructs with the three revised scale scores. For both the TCS-10 Total and Appearance Con-gruence scores, correlations with ratings of depression (PHQ-9) and negative affect (PANAS) were nonsignificant. Finally, higher TCS-10 Gender Identity Acceptance scores were significantly related to lower depression and negative affect.    Demographic Comparisons For those who specified within one of the 3-category gender con-structs (transmasculine, transfeminine, gender diverse), ANOVA com-parisons of the TCS-10 Total score revealed a significant effect of gen-der identity category (F(2,192) = 4.07, Mse = 0.350, p = 0.019). This excluded the 15 participants who did not specify within one of these categories. Follow-up comparisons using Tukey’s LSD demonstrated significantly lower TCS-10 Total scores for those who identify as gen-der diverse (M = 3.017, SD = 0.584) compared to both transmascu-line (M = 3.291, SD = 0.599, p = 0.015) and transfeminine (M = 3.312, SD = 0.589, p = 0.009) identified groups with no difference between the latter two groups (p = 0.825). There was a similar pattern of re-lationships for the TCS-10 Appearance Congruence subscale (F(2,192) = 6.00, Mse = 0.422, p = 0.003), with significantly lower scores for gender diverse identities (M = 2.875, SD = 0.683) compared to both transmasculine (M = 3.233, SD = 0.647, p = 0.004) and transfemi-nine (M = 3.272, SD = 0.631, p = 0.001) identities. This is contrary to prior findings that there were no significant differences in TCS Ap-pearance Congruence scores between gender diverse and transmascu-line and transfeminine identified groups (Jones et al., 2019b). There were no significant differences between groups for TCS-10 Gender Identity Acceptance scores (F(2,192) = 0.213, Mse = 0.385, p = 0.808). Age was not correlated with TCS-10 Total scores (r(156) = −0.082, p Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      19= 0.309), but as noted above, there was substantial missing data for age. ANOVA analyses revealed no significant mean difference in TCS-10 Total scores between gender assigned at birth (i.e., male vs. fe-male; F(1,193) = 0.127, Mse = 0.364, p = 0.722), nor for the TCS-10 Appearance Congruence (F(1,193) = 0.350, Mse = 0.451, p = 0.555) or TCS-10 Gender Identity Acceptance (F(1,193) = 0.300, Mse = 0.389, p = 0.585) subscales. Discussion The current study examined the two-factor structure of the TCS found in the original validation study by Kozee et al. (2012) in an additional sample of TGD individuals with a larger proportion of participants who identified outside the gender binary. Overall, the results indicated that the fit of the original model did not perform as well in the current sample compared to the initial studies, and that internal consistency was lower among the three scale groupings, which was contrary to the expectation that the original factors and items would be retained in the current sample and would demonstrate internal consistency. While we retained the original two-factor structure (Appearance Con-gruence and Gender Identity Acceptance), removal of two items via a series of stepwise analyses greatly improved model fit in the current sample, resulting in a 10-item reduced model (TCS-10). As hypothesized, TCS-10 Total, Appearance Congruence, and Gen-der Identity Acceptance scores also demonstrated convergence in the expected direction with several TGD-specific measures. There were positive correlations with gender-related well-being and pride, as well as negative correlations with gender dysphoria, internalized trans-phobia, non-affirmation of gender identity, and gender-related dis-crimination, rejection, and victimization. However, there were also inconsistencies in relationships between constructs (e.g., TCS-10 and aforementioned constructs) that demonstrated different patterns of results than expected, warranting further consideration. For example, only TCS-10 Gender Identity Acceptance was related to rejection and victimization, two distal marginalization stress factors in the Testa et al. (2015) model, while the remaining two distal factors of gender-related discrimination and non-affirmation of gender identity were Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      20related to the TCS-10 Total and Gender Identity Acceptance and the TCS-10 Total and Appearance Congruence scales, respectively. It stands to reason experiences of discrimination, rejection, and victimization relate to one’s internal acceptance of gender (Rood et al., 2017). These findings also suggest that there is a greater likelihood that those with lower appearance congruence might be more likely have to constantly reiterate to others or behave in ways to portray and affirm their gen-der identity. This highlights the need to support and affirm TGD peo-ple who are less comfortable or feel less congruent in their gender as there is a greater likelihood for negative experiences and discrimina-tion to relate to poorer self-image. For some individuals, this support may include medical/surgical affirmation procedures, but all TGD in-dividuals would benefit from dismantling oppressive systemic struc-tures that devalue diverse gender identities (Cizek et al., 2021). The lack of relationship of the total score with rejection and vic-timization was surprising but may have been due to the fact that Appearance Congruence subscale contributes a majority of items to the total score and was itself not related to rejection and victimiza-tion. Non-affirmation items in the GMSR (e.g., “I have difficulty be-ing perceived as my gender”) pertain more to physical perceptions of gender, rather than internal views of gender identity, making the pattern of relationships with the TCS-10 Total and Appearance Con-gruence scales consistent with content validity of the items in the TCS. Furthermore, contrary to our hypothesis, two of the three prox-imal marginalization stressors (negative expectations and nondis-closure) in the Testa et al. model were unrelated to the TCS-10 Total and both subscales, with the third, internalized transphobia, hav-ing a modest relationship with the total score and a stronger rela-tionship with Gender Identity Acceptance. This suggests that one’s sense of acceptance of their own internal experience of gender may be more strongly related to internalized beliefs about the meaning of being TGD rather than to external gender congruence. Addition-ally, both internal and external experiences of gender may be some-what removed from what it means for how the world will react to one’s gender identity. Alternatively, it may be that this scale now measures more about appearance rather than internal gender con-cepts given the removal of one of the three items that assessed per-sonal acceptance of participants’ gender identities. Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      21Consistent with hypothesized relationships between the TCS and general well-being measures, higher TCS-10 Total scores were asso-ciated with lower gender dysphoria, a TGD-specific well-being mea-sure, and greater overall life satisfaction and positive affect. Contrary to previous findings by Kozee et al. (2012), TCS-10 Total and subscale scores did not correlate with anxiety; however, Gender Identity Accep-tance was negatively related to depression and negative affect. This differs from the original TCS validation studies in which Kozee et al. (2012) reported correlations between all three TCS scales (Total, Ap-pearance Congruence, Gender Identity Acceptance) with both depres-sion (r = −0.53, −0.49, −0.41, respectively) and anxiety (r = −0.33, −0.30, −0.24, respectively) using the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; Beck & Steer, 1993), respectively. It is unlikely that the different pattern of results is attributable to the specific scales as the PHQ-9 and BDI-II tend to correlate highly (e.g., r = 0.77; Kung et al., 2013). Similarly, the GAD-7 and the BAI correlate with one another (e.g., r = 0.72; Spitzer et al., 2006). The lack of correlation between TCS-10 scales and wellbeing mea-sures may have been impacted by the removal of items from the orig-inal item structure for the TCS Total scale and Appearance Congru-ence subscale. In order to understand the changes that item removal may have made for the differences in patterns of relationships be-tween the original TCS in the validation study and the TCS-10 in the current study, the authors conducted additional post hoc analyses to explore any changes in relationships before and after item removal. Specifically, there were modest but significant relationships between the original TCS total score and negative affect (r = 0.17, p = 0.017), as well as for the original Appearance Congruence subscale with anx-iety (r = 0.15, p = 0.033) and negative affect (r = 0.18, p = 0.011) in the current sample prior to item removal. This suggests that the re-moved items may impact relationships between the TCS and negative affect as well as anxiety; however, it should be noted that these effects were small prior to item removal. However, this did not impact rela-tionships with the original Gender Identity Acceptance items as they were not significantly related to constructs of well-being in the pres-ent sample prior to item removal (r = 0.02–0.05, p > 0.05). Due to some clear differences in relationships among these variables, future Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      22research is needed to better understand the relationship between gen-der congruence and negative affective experiences. Finally, contrary to hypothesis that scores would not be signifi-cantly different between transmasculine, transfeminine, and gender diverse identity groups, there was a significant difference in average scores between the binary and gender diverse gender groups. Those with gender diverse identities scored significantly lower on the Total and Appearance Congruence scales than those with transmasculine or transfeminine gender identities. While this is not consistent with ex-pectations for the TCS to perform equally well for those across the gender spectrum, it may be that those with gender diverse identities are less likely to endorse appearance-related congruence as they have difficulty expressing a nonbinary identity that lacks clear social norms or, perhaps, they do not aspire to “fit” within a binary gender cate-gory. Both of these explanations would be likely to result in lower ap-pearance-related ratings. However, as hypothesized, the groups scored equivalently on the Gender Identity Acceptance highlighting that over-all, the sample scored similarly on items pertaining to internal accep-tance of their own gender identity. As such, the overall TCS appears to capture internal acceptance well across the gender spectrum; how-ever, there may be further investigation needed in order to understand how gender diverse individuals read and understand aspects of exter-nal gender congruence within the TCS. Overall, this study demonstrated that in general, gender congru-ence is associated with greater TGD resilience and well-being, es-pecially pertaining to internal views of gender. This is consistent with theoretical models that emphasize resilience, including posi-tive affect, is at least partially orthogonal to stress, negative affect, or mental health rather than being an opposite pole (e.g., Breslow et al., 2015). High resilience is not simply low stress or better mental health. It also highlighted that experiences of marginalization may well have implications for internal views of gender as well as asso-ciations with negative mental health. As such, gender congruence appears to be an important aspect for TGD resiliency and should be considered in future research on TGD health disparities. While the ideal is for communities and institutions to address disparities and discrimination at the source, in the meantime, a salient need exists for building resiliency in the face of marginalizing experiences and Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      23to build on gender diverse identity affirmation. Further, as there are disparate findings regarding differences in gender congruence among gender binary and gender diverse people, there is a need for further understanding regarding gender identity and congruence among gender diverse communities. Limitations The results of this study must be considered in light of its limitations. First, the primary confirmatory factor analysis was collapsed across gender identity groups. Individuals who identified as gender diverse made up about one-fifth of the sample and scored significantly lower on TCS-10 Total and Appearance Congruence constructs than those who identified as transfeminine or transmasculine. Participants in the gender diverse group used a variety of labels for themselves in the free response option, suggesting heterogeneity in gender identity. Gender congruence may have many meanings for this group which may not be measured equally well as when the same scale as is used for TGD people who identify as either transmasculine or transfeminine, par-ticularly in appearance-related aspects. Since gender groups were not compared in the original validation samples (Kozee et al., 2012) and there were disparate findings for those with gender diverse identities, further study is needed to test the reliability and validity of the TCS or TCS-10 in a primarily gender diverse sample. Secondly, while the sample was sufficiently large to detect appro-priate model solutions for similar CFAs (Wolf et al., 2013), replica-tions are needed to confirm the current factor analysis. Relatedly, as the data were collected from one sample, additional compari-son samples would allow for examination of the replicability of the current factor analysis. A third limitation is that the sample did not represent the diversity of TGD communities which limits gen-eralizability. The sample was mostly White or European American (75%), which highlights the need for further examination among other salient identity factors such as race and ethnicity, as well as other facets of identities. A larger, more diverse sample would al-low for greater statistical power to perform comparisons among demographic and identity factors as well as more complex struc-tural analyses. Our research team is currently investigating research Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      24methodologies and recruitment strategies that yield samples that are more representative of the diversity of TGD communities, particu-larly communities of color. Additionally, as with most general recruitment for online survey participation, there is a self-selection bias that must be considered. Due to this type of recruitment, the findings likely are not entirely representative of all TGD people and experiences and should be in-terpreted in the context of the current sample who chose to partici-pate in the study. This self-selection process limits the ability to un-derstand the rate of response and potential communities that might be underrepresented in the sample as mentioned previously. Future re-search might find ways to track reach and rate of response to under-stand this process more thoroughly of who does and does not choose to participate in survey research. A final limitation was the adaptation of the items to past tense (i.e., My outward appearance represented my gender identity) deviates from the original items that were phrased in current tense (i.e., My outward appearance represents my gender identity). This change was made to better fit with other measures in the overall survey data collection for the sake of consistency of timeframe. Given that the original instruc-tions also included the 2-week reference, it seems unlikely that this grammatical change impacted the results. However, such a possibil-ity cannot be completely ruled out. Conclusions Measurement of key constructs is crucial to the scientific endeavor. Empirical research to improve quality of life and reduce health dis-parities for TGD people cannot proceed without culturally appropriate and sound psychometric measures. Kozee et al.’s (2012) work to de-velop the TCS is important because it addressed the need for empiri-cally supported measurement and avoided a narrow focus on transi-tion and gender binary assumptions for TGD identities. The current study failed to support the adequate model fit of the 12-item TCS, but the current findings suggest that a 10-item, two-factor measure is an important and valid measure of gender congruence that addresses var-ious aspects of TGD-identity congruence domains. Huit  et  al .  in  Sexual ity  Research and  So c ial  P ol icy  (2021)      25Implications for Social Policy and Research It is crucial to contextualize well-being of TGD persons within a so-cio-ecological framework, including experiences of marginalization, as they contribute to overall health disparities among gender minor-ity individuals (Williams & Mann, 2017). The ultimate onus of change regarding negative perceptions of gender diverse identities needs to take place at systems and policy levels, including protections for the rights of all identities and inclusion of all persons, namely gender di-verse individuals. While the current analysis focuses on individual levels of functioning and resilience, ultimate change must happen at these broader levels in order to alleviate the burdens faced by mar-ginalized communities. Gender congruence should be conceptualized as a key aspect of TGD experiences in future research given its role in the overall well-being of TGD people. However, further attention is needed for repli-cation and convergence of findings in diverse samples to understand the nuances and complexities of intersectional identities that impact experiences of gender identity (Watson et al., 2020) that were beyond the bounds of the current sample. Overall, the importance of gender congruence as an aspect of resilience spotlights the strength of TGD persons when much of the scientific and cultural discourse is about deficits. *    *    *    *Acknowledgments We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Jolene Smyth, the Trans Collaborations Local Community Board, and the participants for taking the time to contribute to our work.

    "abstract": "Introduction Despite increased attention to transgender and gender diverse (TGD) issues in psychological literature during the past decade, gaps remain for psychometric validation of TGD-specific measures. Kozee et al. (Psychology of Women Quarterly 36(2):179–196, 2012) addressed such gaps by creating the Transgender Congruence Scale (TCS), measuring gender acceptance and feelings of gender congruence between internal and external attributes across a broad range of gender identities. The current study extended Kozee and colleagues’ work by further examining the psychometric properties of the TCS.\nMethods Between October and November of 2017, 210 transmasculine, transfeminine, and gender diverse adults between ages 19 and 73 completed online surveys containing demographic, gender identity-specific, and well-being measures including the TCS.\nResults Results of confirmatory factor analysis replicated the original two-factor model (Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity Acceptance), with the elimination of two poorly loading items, resulting in a 10-item reduced model (TCS-10). Higher scores on TCS-10 were associated with positive scores on gender-related well-being, congruence, and pride, positive affect, and life satisfaction, as well as lower scores on gender-related dysphoria, non-affirmation, internalized transphobia, and marginalization. There were modest but significant associations between Gender Identity Congruence and both depression and negative affect.\nConclusions Despite limitations of sample size and diversity of identities, the study reaffirmed the utility of the TCS as an overall construct of gender identity congruence with a 10-item reduced structure related to other established TGD constructs.\nPolicy Implications Though socio-political climate is the ultimate domain for alleviating TGD stigma and discrimination, factors such as gender congruence are essential areas of focus to foster resiliency",
