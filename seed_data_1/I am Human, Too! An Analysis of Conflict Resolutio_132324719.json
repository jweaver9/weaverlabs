Most of the time, one focuses on the date of birth and date of death ignoring the “hyphen” in between. However, that “hyphen” in between those dates describes an individual’s evolution and lived experiences. As I write the acknowledgements section of my dissertation, I find it hard to believe that the former shy, sheltered and introverted teenager from Hialeah, Florida, who dropped out of high school at the age of 16, is earning his PhD. Although I have always had a passion for education, school was simply not for me. I was bullied as a teen and did not have many friends. As mentioned in the new musical Dear Evan Hansen, I felt as if was I was waving through a window. I was waving for someone – anyone – to notice me and wave back. It was not until a tragic incident in my life, the sudden death of my mother when I was 16 years old, that I was no longer able to simply wave through a window and hope for someone to notice. I was forced, by life’s circumstances, to break the window and take control of my life.  It was not until at the age of 17, when I started at Miami Dade College, that my drive and passion for education began.  My family and friends have always been my rock. Without their support, none of my accomplishments would be possible. Nilda Pineiro, Lily Calderon, and Marina “Jefucha” Hernandez, embraced me when I first started college. Their selflessness, unconditional support, and dedication to my success provided me with the foundation I needed to begin this journey. Individuals like Dr. Isabel Rodriguez-Dehmer, Dr. Jose Vicente, Tere Collada and Dr. Malou Harrison have   believed in me from day one and have been my rocks throughout this process. It is because of their support and trust that I have achieved this milestone.  To my dissertation committee who have guided me and assisted me through this process: My chair Dr. Jason J. Campbell—Thank you for believing in me and your unconditional support. Dr. Arlen Garcia—Your commitment to this process is more than what I will ever be able to thank you for. Dr. Judith McKay—Thank you for your prompt responses and unconditional support.  Carlyn Jorgensen and Niki Incorvia—Thank you for your guidance and support through this process. You were always there when I needed you.  Leen—Thank you. I could not have done this without your unconditional commitment and support. Your friendship and willingness to guide me through this process is the true meaning of commitment.  To the Starbucks staff in Miami Lakes: Thank you for the Frappuccinos, conversations during my break, and allowing me to spend many hours a day at your location. It truly takes a village.  Some say that blood is thicker than water, but I have been blessed to have friends that I have laughed with, cried with, and have had shared memories with that will last a lifetime. It is not that I consider them family—they are family.  Ana, Yvette, Nick and Ang—Thank you for your support during my journey. The card nights, the laughs, and you all pushing me to finish “my paper” really made a difference in this journey. You have been there for me and I am grateful to have you all in my life.    Donald- Thank you for “el cafecito”, your support and opening your home. I am grateful, my friend.  Erika- Thank you for staying part of my live for over 20 years. We have shared many memories that will never be forgotten.  Steph, Mel, Ernie and Kesia—It is hard to put in words what you all mean to me. You are part of me. You will always be in my life and I am grateful to you for allowing me to be part of yours. Thank you for loving me unconditionally and supporting me. You have all been instrumental through this journey. We have been through it all! We have been happy, sad, broke, have traveled the world- but most importantly, we have been there for each other! To infinity and beyond! Helen—I have told you many times before—you are probably one of the smartest people I have ever met. What I do not tell you enough is how kind, loyal, and selfless you are. I cannot put into words how much I appreciate your support through this journey. You have been more than a friend. You have been my therapist and guiding light in moments of darkness. I am forever grateful for your support.  To my little niece Vicky and nephew Lio—Tio Jaime loves you. Always remember the importance of an education. It will truly provide you with endless opportunities.  There are four people in my life that are my backbone. They are the reason why I do what I do and continue to succeed. Titi Gladys- Thank you for loving me and being there for me during the hardest times of my life. Always know that I love you and will always be there for you. Ala—you are sweet, extremely intelligent and I love you for   being just the way you are. You have been there since day one for me. Education has always meant to you what it now means to me. Your text messages of encouragement kept me going when I thought it was not possible.  Papi—It is because of YOU that I am where I am today. You are hardworking and a perfect role model. You have taught me how to be kind, hardworking, and that anything is possible. I have seen how much you have sacrificed for us and I am eternally grateful. Tus sacrificios hicieron posible que yo pudiera cumplir este sueño. GRACIAS. Te quiero mucho.  To my little brother Karlos—You know how much you mean to me. You are the reason why I work as hard as I do. I look up to you and I hope you always know that you are the most important person in my life. You are my little big brother and I will always be here for whatever you need.  To the three people whom I have loved most that are no longer here: Nena, Tia and Mami—Thank you for always being by my side although the universe decided you no longer belonged to this world. Your teachings have stayed with me during the hardest of times. There were many times when I thought I couldn’t continue and I kept going- kept pushing myself. You have been there for me just as much-or more than anyone else in my life. This accomplishment is as much mine as it is yours.   i  Table of Contents List of Tables

Incidents such as the Stonewall Riots, pride marches, and manifestos, among others, have served as a way for the LGBTQ community to attempt to take a stand against the systems in place that perpetuate inequality. Factors such as identity and gender have directly impacted the level to which individuals are shunned from their families, communities and social nexus. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how factors such as identity and gender impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community. In addition, this dissertation aims to determine the applicability of three conflict resolution theories: structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, to the LGBTQ community. This study analyzes the history of the LGBTQ community, identity formation theories, gender expectations in society, and factors that lead to alienation and marginalization. This dissertation is a qualitative study which utilizes case study methodology to analyze the existing literature related to the aforementioned topics. In this study, the reader is provided with a detailed explanation of the applicability of the three theories, including the role of factors such as identity, gender, and integration versus tolerance in the LGBTQ community. The study concludes with an analysis of the theories, recommendations for future research, and insight for those who aim to resolve conflict in the LGBTQ community.  1  Chapter 1: Introduction Most individuals wish to live in a world where there are appropriate systems in place for equality, peace, and unity to be prevalent. However, when deciding how these objectives will be met, disparities may arise amongst different groups, resulting in conflict. Without the appropriate tools or strategies to address these conflicts, individuals and/or groups can affect the dynamics and interactions of those within a system (Colander, 2005). More importantly, these negative interactions and conflicts can result in the alienation and marginalization of certain groups within a system. The purpose of this dissertation is to shed light on the alienation and marginalization the LGBTQ community has faced throughout the years in the United States. Additionally, this dissertation provides an in depth understanding of the factors that have contributed to said alienation and marginalization. Lastly, how such alienation and marginalization has resulted in a community in need of a conflict resolution model that directly addresses and resolves these conflicts (2005).  According to Fischer (1990), intergroup conflict occurs between collections of people such as ethnic or racial groups, departments or levels of decision making in the same organization or geographical location. In this type of conflict, group members tend to develop stereotypes of the opposing group, and practice discrimination against them. Behind the study of conflict strategy and tactics, is the hope that individuals who are aware of their options, will make better choices in conflicts than those who feel they have no choices or very limited options.  2  The history of the LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer) community and its movements, like many other marginalized communities, provides a rich narrative for analysis through the lens of conflict resolution. In the 1970s and early 1980s, urban areas across the United States witnessed an influx of thousands of lesbians and gay men, the result of what anthropologist Kath Weston (1998), calls The Great Gay Migration. Upon learning about the existence of “gay ghettos” and gay communities, men and women with same-sex inclinations flocked to major cities, such as San Francisco, in the post-Stonewall years (1998).  As a result of the establishment of these “gay spaces” (D’Emilio, 1983), a gay and lesbian culture flourished. Just as Anderson (1991) documents the role that print culture, media, and literature served for culturally constructing this community, Bronski reports the means through which a “gay sensibility” was created (Bronski, 1984). Movies, theater, opera, books, periodicals, and pornography allowed for the development of a gay subculture (Dyer, 1977).  Urban gay subcultures often included various common elements, such as drag, disco, and various gender-bending practices, such as butch-fem couplings and styles (Levine, 1979; Newton, 1993; Fikentscher, 2000; Stein, 1997).  As these common elements developed, gay and lesbian cultural visibility within mainstream culture increased as well.  Suzanna Danuta Walters (2003) documents the strange paradox of gay and lesbian politics at the turn of the century.  While gays were “all the rage” in the cultural sphere, appearing in television shows and movies, progress in the political and legal spheres had been stalled or regressed in some places. Increasingly, cultural representations of lesbians and gay men were no longer always 3  produced, circulated, and/or received solely by gay men and women.  In more recent years, the authenticity of gay culture has been called into question and many gay men and scholars have written vehement critiques of gay culture. As    early as 1996, queer cultural critic, Mark Simpson, known for popularizing the term “metrosexual,” published an edited volume titled, Anti-Gay.  The volume includes essays such as, “Gay Dream Believer: Inside the Gay Underwear Cult,” “Gay Culture: Who Needs It?” and “A Case for the Closet,” the last of which argues that the gay culture which one encounters when one comes out is, in fact, the best reason to remain there (Simpson, 1996). Simpson’s condemnatory commentary on the underside of gay culture is an example of the critical voices that have arisen in regards to the concept of “gay culture” and its wider implications.  While these internal critiques often target the commodification and commercialization of gay culture, they also rely on a respect for early gay culture (Chasin 2000; Hennessy 2000). Early gay culture is believed to have emerged organically and during a period of acute marginalization in the latter part of the twentieth century (Levine, 1979).  Other eminent critiques, especially from gay conservatives, have either been assumed or suggested on the basis of the writings of several prominent writers. Andrew Sullivan (2003), consistently called for the “end of gay culture” on his blog, “The Daily Dish”, arguing that a collective gay culture is only necessary in the face of marginalization.  For a time, there was a gay sensibility and culture produced through the experiences of “being in the closet and coming out”, issues that were intimately tied to particular places and can be seen as lived experiences by those individuals.  Sullivan and 4  others argue that the days of the gay ghetto, however, are over and that gay and lesbian space is now an imagined space. Due to recent exposure of previously condemned behaviors, the lens in which the public views homosexual tendencies is less condemnatory (2003).   There may be truth in the notion that “gay and lesbian space” has been reconfigured in the last decade or so and that public representations of the LGBTQ community have become commercialized to a significant degree. It would be a grave error, however, to suggest that these changes have resulted in the elimination of alienation and marginalization for the community. This is particularly true for older individuals who came of age—and came out—during previous decades where there was significantly greater pressure from mainstream society to conform to social norms. These individuals may continue to experience an “incongruence between their culture, needs, and experiences and the greater societal structures” (Rokach, 2014, p. 150).  There are three stressors that have been identified as contributing to the experience of alienation, marginalization, and elevated feelings of loneliness and isolation that the LGBTQ community experiences. The first is derived from direct experiences with prejudice events. For the older generation of LGBTQ individuals, the experience of being a direct target for prejudice on a range of levels is almost inevitable. Although the younger generation may experience prejudice and marginalization to a slightly lesser degree, these events remain common (Rokach, 2014).  The second major stressor that contributes to alienation and marginalization within the LGBTQ community is commensurate with the first; this is the expectation of 5  prejudice reactions. After experiencing several prejudice events, an individual develops the internal expectation of being rejected and targeted. The expectations can be easily understood within the frameworks of social learning theory and the negative reinforcement mechanisms of behaviorism. The negative experiences that are consistently experienced reinforce the internal expectation of receiving more negativity, and this is a considerable stressor for members of the LGBTQ community (Rokach, 2014). Steele (1997) described stereotype threat as a “threat in the air”, or the presence of feeling at risk of conforming to negative stereotypes based on your social group. Though Steele’s (1997) concept of stereotype threat was used to examine the effects of race in academic performance, particularly standardized tests, the concept has considerable implications for the LGBTQ community. Meyer (2003) elaborates on the concept of stereotype threat to explain the concept of “minority stress”, the “excess stress to which individuals from stigmatized social categories are exposed as a result of their social, often a minority, position” (p. 3). This perceived and anticipated stigma has a wide-ranging impact on a number of different life areas: including relationships, mental health, work, sexual function/dysfunction, HIV risk behaviors, substance abuse, negative body image, propensity to domestic violence, and self-esteem issues. Meyer (2003) found that compared with heterosexuals, those in the LGBTQ community “suffer from more mental health problems including substance abuse, affective disorders, and suicide” due to excess stress caused by stigma and prejudice (p. 24). The resulting feelings of alienation and marginalization from these stressors contribute to society’s “tolerance” of this community and thus perpetuating these feelings in the members of the community. The 6  concept of “tolerance” will be explored more in depth throughout this dissertation (Meyer, 2003). A third ongoing stressor and cause of alienation relates directly to the extent which an individual engages with the LGBTQ community. Rokach (2014), notes that the role of community is uniquely important for LGBTQ individuals, “[Un]like other groups that are marginalized in society […] a significant proportion of LGBTQs do not, commonly have family support” (p. 150). This vacancy is often an additional sub-stressor, as many individuals find themselves torn between living an authentic, open life without support from or close relationships with family members, or living a double and/or hidden life in which their sexual orientation and identity is disguised from family members (Rokach). In both cases, loneliness is inevitable.  It is for this reason that support from the broader LGBTQ community is so fundamentally important, as it gives individuals a safe place in which to find acceptance and support. At the same time, the community itself is not without problems and there are certain facets of LGBTQ culture which may further serve to exacerbate a state of alienation and marginalization. These factors are described more succinctly below (Rokach, 2014).   These stressors affect the individual at an intrapersonal level for they create a sense of loneliness, rejection, self-doubt and a dissonance from who they are compared to and whom they are expected to be. However, once such expression is projected, interpersonal conflicts within the self and their social nexus may arise.  7  Statement of Problem Throughout the years, perceptions of the LGBTQ community have changed and cultural visibility has improved. Despite improvements, many individuals in the LGBTQ community experience conflict while attempting to balance leading an authentic life while attempting to conform to society’s standards of appropriate behavior.  In recent decades, modern culture has taken steps forward to assimilate the notion that human beings exist within a broad continuum of sexual orientation, gender identity, and cultural norms. This revolution, which has been slow in coming and is very much still underway, is occurring both within the heterosexual world and also within the LGBTQ community. Thus, society is increasingly unable to sustain the burden of what Goldman (2007) calls “compulsory heterosexuality” that has permeated our homes, schools, media and communities for centuries. The struggle for recognition and acceptance is far from over; however, ongoing prejudice, stereotypes, and the perpetuation of “mandatory false structuring” in relation to sex, gender, and gender roles continues to support a level of homophobia in society. Mandatory false structuring, or forcefully structuring and living your life according to society’s expectations results in intrapersonal conflict—which in turn manifests interpersonally. At the same time, there are problems that arise from within the interior of LGBTQ culture. Though these problems may relate to the external factors and pressures of homophobia that have just been described, the establishment of “gay culture” and specific LGBTQ communities also give rise to their own unique set of issues and dilemmas (Goldman, 2007). The tendency for certain groups within the LGBTQ community to splinter off and create sub-8  cultures is one such problem. The use of labels and projected identities such as “fem”, “butch”, “queer”, “dyke”, “faggot” and other labels create rigidity within an otherwise fluid culture. This issue can be interpreted through a lens of identity formation and a number of theoretical templates (2007).  In addition to the question of identity, there is a problem surrounding the word “tolerance” and its significance in relation to the discussion of LGBTQ individuals and culture. The notion of “tolerance” has often been at the center of discussion surrounding the ways in which mainstream society and culture interact with LGBTQ matters. On the surface, the notion of “tolerance” appears to be positive and useful in overcoming cultural fears and homophobia. At the same time, there is a strong argument to be made to the effect of tolerance contributing to further marginalization and alienation of minority groups, and of LGBTQ communities in particular (Goldman, 2007). This may be attributed to the fact that “tolerance” implies a concept, person, or object that must be tolerated, or in other words, endured. The inherent etymological meaning of the word projects a negative connotation onto whatever it is that is being “tolerated” by the mainstream. It can be argued that this problem of “tolerance” and its associated meaning is at the root of much of the ongoing marginalization and alienation that is still occurring to the LGBTQ community (Goldman, 2007) Research Questions This dissertation examines the factors that contribute to the ongoing alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community. A thorough analysis of the relevant research on the LGBTQ community and the applicability of three selected conflict 9  resolution theories will guide this study. The research questions that inform this dissertation are as follows:  1. How and why do factors such as gender and identity impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community? 2. How and why are structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theories applicable to the LGBTQ community as conflict resolution theories?  Research Method The aim of this study is twofold: 1) to investigate how factors such as gender and identity impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community and 2) to analyze the applicability of structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, as conflict resolution theories to the LGBTQ community. When selecting the methodology for this study, the researcher contemplated several different approaches for this dissertation. Grounded Theory, Phenomenology, and a Quantitative Analysis were all methods that were considered. However, the purpose of this study is not to create a model or a theory as it relates to the LGBTQ community. As a result, Grounded Theory was not selected as the method for this study. Phenomenology was also considered for this study, however, since the researcher aimed at analyzing the collective experience of the LGBTQ community rather than learning how a particular group or subgroup of individuals in the LGBTQ community experienced a particular phenomena. Although a quantitative analysis could also have been selected, such methodology would not have provided answers to the “how and why” of the phenomena that this study aims to explore. 10  Content analysis, in particular, the case study methodology is the most suitable method for this exploration because this study investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context. That is, the ongoing alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community, the factors that impact integration in the community, and how the interplay of these factors are riddled with conflict. The single case approach was implemented in this study. According to Yin (2013), the single case approach “captures the circumstances and conditions of an everyday situation” (p. 52). This study aims to capture and analyze the factors and conditions that contribute to the alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community. These factors and conditions derived from an extensive examination of the literature regarding identity formation, integration versus tolerance, and the contemporary gay and lesbian movement. This literature then informed the analysis of the selected conflict resolution models (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, structural violence, and social cubism) and their applicability to the LGBTQ community.  Further, this method allows for understanding “complex social phenomena,” in particular, the marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community and how such alienation has resulted in a community in need of a conflict resolution approach that promotes integration or acceptance versus tolerance.  The community is examined as a whole and due to the holistic nature of the selected conflict resolution strategies, a holistic case study design was used. Though there are various subunits within the LGBTQ community (“femmes,” “butch,” etc.), the findings of this study can be applied to addressing conflict within the LGBTQ 11  community as a whole. However, further research can be initiated to better address the subunits within the community as there is much diversity in the community; some conflict resolution theories may be more applicable to certain subunits than others due to the unique conflicts experienced by these individuals. Delimitations of Study The most significant limitation of this study is that no fieldwork was conducted. Instead, the literature is used to provide a framework for the analysis of the factors that contribute to the alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community. An extensive examination of the relevant literature ranging from the history of the LGBTQ community to identity formation theories, and conflict resolution theories was conducted. Another limitation of this study is that the researcher focused on the LGBTQ community as a whole rather than the various subunits of the LGBTQ community (gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer and transgender). Although the community has several shared experiences, individuals that prescribe to a particular subunit may also have unique experiences as it relates to the way he/she struggles with alienation and marginalization. In addition, this study does not create a model of conflict resolution tailored to the LGBTQ community, but instead, determines the applicability or lack thereof of three conflict resolution models to the LGBTQ community.  Definition of Terms The following terms are used extensively throughout the dissertation and are integral to the understanding of the study. Operational definitions follow. 12  Alienation. the state of being disenfranchised from a person or a group of individuals.  Cisgender. a person whose identity and expressed gender corresponds with his/her birth sex. Community. the symbolic expression of strongly expressed commonalities; a strong connection with others, primarily family, friends and close neighbors. (Various concepts of community are discussed in Chapter Two of the dissertation). Gender. Range of characteristics associated with femininity and masculinity. These characteristics are influenced by social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. Gender Identity. a person's internal sense of being male or female, usually developed at an early age as a result of parental influences and societal influences, which is further developed  during puberty.  Identity. the fact of being who or what a person or thing is. One’s identity is derived from their qualities, beliefs, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc. Integration. an act or instance of combining into an integral whole. Intrapersonal Conflict. occurs within an individual but can be influenced by outside stimuli. Interpersonal Conflict. refers to conflict between two or more individuals Marginalization. is the social disadvantage and relegation to the fringe of society; exclusion 13  Patriarchy. a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women and other minorities are largely excluded from it. Sex. refers to the biological differences between males and females. Social norms. the rules of behavior that are considered acceptable in a group or society; largely dependent on gender.  Tolerance. the ability or willingness to tolerate something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with. Violence. exercise of physical force or intimidation by the exhibition of such force. Outline of Dissertation This dissertation will be divided into five chapters. The first chapter will provide a brief history of the LGBTQ community, the research methodology, the problem statement, the research questions that will guide the study, and the definition of important terms used throughout the dissertation. Chapter two will provide detailed information on the existing literature on the chosen topics for this dissertation, as well as the gaps in the literature. Additionally, it will provide a historical explanation on the alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community as well as the interpersonal factors such as identity and gender that have contributed to the ongoing repression of the community. Chapter three details the research method including the process on how to conduct a case study analysis and data collection and analysis. Chapter four presents the analysis of the study conducted as well as answers the research questions that guided the study. Chapter 14  five further discusses the findings of the study, strengths and limitations of the study, and recommendations for further research. 15  Chapter 2: Literature Review Today, the term “gay and lesbian community” is bandied about by politicians, activists, journalists, and those from within the community alike.  Given the changes that have occurred within “gay culture” over the last few decades, several fundamental questions arise: What constitutes this “gay and lesbian community” currently?  To what degree does it have an empirical referent?  To what degree is it imagined?  What are the relationships between the empirical referent and the way it is imagined? What are the boundaries of this community?  The beginning of this chapter aims to answer these questions by reviewing the existing academic literature on the factors that play a role both in identity formation and in the notion of “tolerance” as it pertains to the marginalization of the LGBTQ community, as well as the effects of the various forms of conflict that those in the LGBTQ community have and continue to experience. The chapter also explores the works of Bem (1994), Butler (1988; 1997; 2007), Cooley and Mead (1967), Crenshaw (1989; 1991), Foucault (1978; 1980, 1995), and Sedgewick (1990; 2003), among others. The works of these writers lay a foundation for understanding how and why conflict emerges in the LGBTQ community. Community as a Concept When examining the LGBTQ community and its history, it is imperative to analyze the work of those that have paved the way to provide an explanation of the term community and its implications. In The Sociological Tradition, an analysis of the origins of the sociological discipline in the 19th century, sociologist Robert Nisbet (1993) argues that community is “the most fundamental and far-reaching of sociology’s unit-ideas” (p. 16  47).  According to Nisbet’s analysis, Frédérick Le Play introduces the comparative, substantive, and empirical studies of community, while Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber make use of community as typologies or ideal types. In contrast, Emile Durkheim believes that “community becomes a framework of analysis,” a methodology, “a means of analysis of human thought behavior” (Nisbet, 1993, p. 82). In contrast to the individualistic rationalism of his day, Durkheim argued that community “has prior reality, and it is from community that the essential elements of reason flow. Crime and suicide, religion and morality, economic competition and law—all of these are approached with a methodology “based on the priority of the community” (Nisbet, 1993, p. 83).  In the conceptions of classical sociology, “communities” were “fusion[s] of feeling and thought, of tradition and commitment, of membership and volition […] found in, or given symbolic expression by locality, religion, nation, race, occupation, or crusade” (Nisbet, 1993, p. 48). In other words, individuals formed communities as the symbolic expression of strongly expressed commonalities, which manifested through “feeling and thought”. Community, in this sense, relied upon the strength of a connection with others, primarily family, friends, and close neighbors. In the modern world, communities are no longer rooted in place, immediately experienced, nor locally configured. Instead communities in the modern sense are symbolically constructed and culturally imagined (Cohen, 1999).  In a term first coined in his study on the emergence and persistence of the nation, Benedict Anderson (1991) defines the nation as an “imagined political community”: 17  It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion […] The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations […] It is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship (p.6). The concept of an imagined community highlights the socially constructed nature of nations, national identities, and nationalism. That they are imagined, however, does not mean that they are false, but rather that they are socio-cognitive constructions, “Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity or genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined” (Anderson, 1991, p.6).  When considered in this framework, community can be interpreted as an abstraction, rather than as a concrete establishment.  According to Nisbet (1993), the word community “encompasses all forms of relationship which are characterized by a high degree of personal intimacy, emotional depth, moral commitment, social cohesion, and continuity in time” (p. 47). A prime example of Nisbet’s definition of community has been exhibited by members of the LGBTQ community through their shared struggles, successes, and identity expression.  Factors that Impact Community For the classical sociologists, “modern individualism and secularism,” “democratic leveling and unchecked commercialism,” “impersonalism and 18  contractualism,” “rationalization,” and “the rise of technology” were sweeping community away (Adam, 1996, p. 112).  Paradoxically, some of these same processes and influences have provided the conditions of possibility for the emergence of modern gay and lesbian communities and identities. Adam (1996) states that comparing homosexuality in pre-capitalist societies to the modern gay and lesbian community isolates the transition to capitalism as the source of a radical reorganization of “the significance of kinship and family” (p. 112). This shift released homosexual relations “from the strictures of the dominant, heterosexual kinship system,” given the greater freedom afforded by the “expansion of the wage-labor sector that accompanied the rise of capitalism” (pp. 112-113). D’Emilio (1993) elaborates on Adam’s research, noting that along with capitalism, came increased individual freedom, and with urbanization, anonymity. Freed from local social constraints and controls, homosexuals were free to begin fashioning lives outside of the prevailing family forms. When expressing support for free market capitalism, gay conservatives often unwittingly reference this connection between capitalism and the emergence of gay identities when they argue that free markets and their logic, rather than governments, are especially kind to gays and lesbians. For the classical scholars who formed the first wave of concepts of “community”, defined earlier in this paper and closely dependent on place, there was a strong sense that “community”, as a cultural concept, was in danger of being entirely lost due to the vicissitudes of industrial progress. In her study, “From the Lesbian Ghetto to Ambient Community: The Perceived Costs and Benefits of Integration for Community,” Brown-Saracino (2011) explains that “industrialization, urbanization, and cities’ heterogeneity 19  threatened or even destroyed community” ( p. 364). This concern is echoed in the work of early sociologists as well.  However, in the 1970s and 1980s, a second wave of scholarship argued that the concerns of classical scholars had been unfounded and that communities continued to flourish in spite of enormous technological and social changes. One reason being that “place-based communities” tend to be forged and thrive among individuals who have a “shared dominant identity trait” or are related by blood (Brown-Saracino, 2011). These place-based communities are known as “ghettos,” or “enclaves”. In the context of shared dominant identity traits, the “gay ghettos” that emerged in the wake of World War II and that continued well into the 1980s and 1990s conform to this framework (Brown-Saracino, 2011).  More recently, what can be described as a third wave of scholarship relating to the concept of community has developed. This current line of thought argues that neither the classical concept of community as a tightly woven sphere destroyed through industrialization, nor the second wave, community as a place-based concept, is accurate in describing modern community (Adam, 1996). These third wave scholars believe that modern community relies upon the nature of ties between individuals, rather than the strength of those ties. Within this framework, a sense of community relies upon the nature of relationships; it is flexible and can adjust with changes to technology and other cultural or societal influences. Support for this concept is abundantly clear when the impact of social media on community is considered. Webber (1963) stated, “never has intimacy been so independent of spatial propinquity” (p. 209). It is notable that Webber 20  (1963) made this statement before the advent of social media, the ubiquitous use of which has rendered his words even more relevant. With the advent of social media, the concept of community and the identity that community engenders continues to shift. This third wave definition of “community” is prevalent in the LGBTQ community, as so many have found refuge in social media forums, to express themselves more freely (1963).  History of Early LGBTQ Communities According to Adam (1996), “people discover each other and form large-scale social networks because of their homosexual interests and not only as a result of already existing relationships” ( p. 111). Another work, Berube’s (1990) Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War Two, examines gay men and women and their tendencies in the military during World War II. Ripped from their small communities around the nation, military men and women with same-sex desires lived in large groups in which they often found others similar to themselves. When discharged many of these men and women formed enclaves in the burgeoning cities on America’s coasts, the same cities that now have vibrant gay and lesbian neighborhoods. Newton’s (1993) Cherry Grove, Fire Island Sixty Years in America's First Gay and Lesbian Town documents the history of the first gay and lesbian resort community in New York. Kennedy and Davis’ (1993) Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold: The History of a Lesbian Community the study of a working-class lesbian community in Buffalo, New York examined the survival and resistance of older “butch femmes”. Chauncey’s (1995) Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World documents the existence of male gay culture in New York before the 1960’s. Stein’s 21  (2000) historical account of gay and lesbian Philadelphia, City of Sisterly and Brotherly Loves: Lesbian and Gay Philadelphia, establishes the importance of Philadelphia as a contributor to the national gay and lesbian movement. More recently, Faderman and Timmons’ (2006), Gay L. A.: A History of Sexual Outlaws, Power Politics, and Lipstick Lesbians documents the development of L.A. as a special home for lesbians and gays for the past two centuries. These historical narratives are not entirely confined to the world of scholarship, but are also assumed by gays and lesbians as their own historical narrative. These cities and towns across the United States have presented safe havens for this community.  In a similar way, figures from these histories seep into the larger culture as well, as illustrated by the recent Oscar winning performance of Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant’s (2008) Hollywood production of Milk, a biopic about the life of the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in California, Harvey Milk. Through a process of cultural diffusion, these “official” narratives become the gay and lesbian community’s narrative, an object both culturally venerated and politically contested. The LGBTQ community has constructed a social nexus that integrates the aspects of their shared lived experiences by creating a movement that has been shaped by these various historical and social experiences.   A Brief History of the Gay and Lesbian Movement in the United States The 1969 Stonewall Riots are widely credited for being the catalyst of the gay liberation movement. According to Carter (2010), as recently as the 1960’s: 22  Homosexual sex was illegal in every state except Illinois. Not one law—federal, state, or local—protected gay men or women from being fired or denied housing. There were no openly gay politicians. No television show had any identifiably gay characters. When Hollywood made a film with a major homosexual character, the character was either killed or killed himself. There were no openly gay policemen, public school teachers, doctors, or lawyers. And no political party had a gay caucus (pp. 1-2) On the morning of June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn was the site of a gay uprising during a routine police raid in a popular gay club in Greenwich Village, New York. The ensuing violent protests and street demonstrations continued on and off for six days becoming known as the The Stonewall Riots. Carter’s (2010) Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution, discusses the significance of the riots and the cause for the violent response of the patrons to against the police. The book attempts to uncover the origins of the riots including the owners and patrons of the inn as well as the social and political climate in New York that led to the riots. According to Carter (2010), several factors converged to foment the riots, but “almost all of the causes lay where the riots took place, in America’s bohemia, Greenwich Village (p.2). At the time, Greenwich Village represented a haven for actors, musicians, artists, and most importantly, for the LGBTQ community. The Stonewall incident is now renowned as a week-long celebration beginning the last Sunday of June, including an annual parade and celebrations in the surrounding lounges, restaurants, and bars in Greenwich Village.   23  Although, four other similar events had already occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the 1960s, they did not take on the same level of iconic significance as the Stonewall Riots. For this reason, sociologists Armstrong and Crage (2006) examine the making of the “Stonewall myth” and conclude that the Stonewall Riots became central to the gay collective memory because activists considered the event to have the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle, the remembrance of the event in a march/parade resonated with gays and lesbians, and that the parade was rather easily institutionalized. Armstrong and Crage (2006,) argue that “the Stonewall story is an achievement of gay liberation rather than an account of its origins” (p. 274). In the same way that the story of Rosa Parks erases the collective memory from the history of the other women who refused to give up their seats on the bus within the context of the Civil Rights Movement, the “Stonewall myth” diminishes the previous history of pain and struggle from the gay and lesbian collective memory. As studies of collective memory show, history itself can be a cultural object.  In the imagining of community, remembering and forgetting are significant and consequential (Armstrong & Crage, 2006). By taking the Stonewall Riots as the starting point of the gay and lesbian movement, the movement roots itself in an oppositional and arbitrary perspective.  Against this common understanding, it should be noted that there is a contingent of gay conservatives who seek to retrieve the earlier homophile history of the movement, and marginalize the Stonewall event as an aberration. A brief historical sketch of the gay and lesbian movement demonstrates that the movement has always been marked by internal 24  political tensions, an ebb and flow between radical and conservative outlooks.  Missing from this history, however, both in its popular and academic forms, is a consideration of gay conservative organizations (Faderman, 2006).  According to Gallo (2007), Harry Hay is considered as the founder of the gay and lesbian movement. In the early 1950’s , Hay, a Communist, created a following that became the Mattachine Society in Los Angeles. Inspired by Marxist political thought, Hay was the first to argue that gays constitute a cultural minority group. The Mattachine Society was mostly devoted to the social support of homosexual men in a climate of hostility (Hay, 1996). Because of his connections to the Communist Party during the Red Scare, Hay and other radicals in the organization’s leadership were ousted in 1953. The new leaders of Mattachine, then with chapters in various cities around the country, modeled themselves after the civil rights organizations of the 1950s.  Mattachine became the leading homophile organization and helped in the formation of the Daughters of Bilitis, an organization for lesbian women in 1955.  Inside the cover of the Daughters’ Newsletter, the first nationally distributed lesbian publication, was the organization’s statement of purpose (Gallo, 2007): 1. Education of the homosexual, to enable her to understand herself and make her adjustment to society, this to be accomplished by establishing a library on the homosexual theme, by sponsoring public discussions to be conducted by leading members of the legal, psychiatric, religious, and other professions, and by advocating a mode of behavior and dress acceptable to society. 25  2. Education to the public, leading to an eventual breakdown of erroneous taboos and prejudices. 3. Participation in research projects by duly authorized and responsible psychologists, sociologists, and other such experts directed towards further knowledge of the homosexual. 4. Investigation of the penal code as it pertains to the homosexual, proposal of changes, and promotion of these changes through the due process of law in the state legislatures. (p. 11) The mission statement of the Daughters of Bilitis is representative of the homophile organizations of the time, all of which stressed respectability and expressed the desire to be accepted into mainstream society. It is clear that full integration and acceptance for the homosexual community into the mainstream was the main goal rather than being submitted to legal repercussions or harassment for behaving in a way that was not deemed appropriate by society’s standards (Gallo, 2007).  Rimmerman (2002) explains that by 1969, many younger gay men and lesbian women were no longer concerned with respectability, nor patient to wait for social change to occur through legislation. Inspired by their counterparts in the civil rights movement, they pushed for a more confrontational approach through direct action.  In the wake of the Stonewall Riots, the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was formed.  Pursuing radical social and cultural change, the GLF aligned itself with the New Left and sought to eradicate homophobia and heterosexism, as well as other broad-based oppressions. Within several months, the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) was founded by dissident 26  members of the GLF who were frustrated with what they perceived to be the utopian goals of the GLF. GAA pursued civil rights reforms for gay people, but through militant means. According to academic studies, the tension exhibited by the differing goals of these two organizations, has continued to impact the movement ever since. The GLF folded in 1972; the GAA in 1974.  By the end of the 1970s, however, the liberationist streak was exhausted and the movement took on a more liberal rights-based approach. Movement organizations directed their attention to city halls, state legislatures, courts, political parties, elections, and the media (Rimmerman, 2002). The liberationist impulse flared up again in the face of the HIV/AIDS crisis.  In 1987, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) formed as a diverse, non-partisan group of individuals united in anger and committed to direct action to end the AIDS crisis (Wolfe, 1994).  ACT UP directed its anger at pharmaceutical companies, Wall Street, churches, schools, and other institutions. At the height of the AIDS crisis, ACT UP’s demonstrations were highly publicized through news media for their direct and highly confrontational manner. From ACT UP, two other notable organizations formed in the early 1990s, Queer Nation and The Lesbian Avengers (Wolfe, 1994). Infuriated by an escalation in anti-gay violence and anti-gay prejudice in the arts and media, Queer Nation was founded in 1990 in New York City. Their more well-known slogans were known as a rallying cry for gay rights: “We’re here, we’re queer, get used to it” and “Dykes and fags bash back!” Dozens of chapters of Queer Nation emerged around the country during this time. In 1992, the Lesbian Avengers formed in New York as well. Wolfe (1994), also explains that, in a way that was similar to Queer Nation in their creative hunt for media 27  attention surrounding queer issues, but also inspired by radical feminism, the Lesbian Avengers also directed their anger at misogyny in the gay and lesbian community. Appropriating the language of the religious right and striking a militant tone, the Lesbian Avengers’ t-shirts read: “We recruit.” The creation of these groups allowed for the opportunity of self-expression in a time where marginalization and alienation was rampant (Wolfe, 1994). Any reading of the social science literature on the gay and lesbian movement would lead one to believe that the movement is built around two impulses: civil rights reform and confrontational liberation. Sociologist Joshua Gamson (1998) provides a brilliant analysis and summary of social movement politics in the postmodern predicament which gives rise to internal divisions in the gay and lesbian movement. In his article, “Must Identity Movements Self-Destruct?  A Queer Dilemma,” the author notes that new social movements no longer compete with and for traditional political power, but also participates in the realm of “Foucaultian power formations”, which aim for normalization and require many social institutions to work in unison (Gamson, 1998). Contentious politics informed by postmodern theory see the emergence of a new type of activism, one predicated on the ability to deconstruct the oppressive categories forced on the dominated by the dominant institutions through their particular discursive regimes (e.g., juridical, pedagogical, psychological discourses). This form of activism is radically different from previous rights-based contests in which a quasi-ethnic, essentialist type of identity is posited. According to Gamson (1998), “two different political impulses and two different forms of organizing can be seen facing off. The logic and political utility of 28  deconstructing collective categories vies with that of shoring them up” (p. 396). Gamson then sums up the internal divisions that result from the postmodern conditioning of collective action: On the one hand, lesbians and gay men have made themselves an effective force in this country over the past several decades largely by giving themselves what civil-rights movements had: a public collective identity.  Gay and Lesbian social movements have built a quasi-ethnicity, complete with its own political and cultural institutions, festivals, neighborhoods, even its own flag.  Underlying that ethnicity is typically the notion that what gays and lesbians share—the anchor of minority status and minority rights claims—is the same fixed, natural essence, a self with same-sex desires.  The shared oppression, these movements have forcefully claimed, is the denial of the freedoms and opportunities to actualize this self.  In this ethnic/essentialist politic, clear categories of collective identity are necessary for successful resistance and political gain. […] Yet this impulse to build a collective identity with distinct group boundaries has been met by a directly opposing logic, often contained in queer activism (and in the newly anointed “queer theory”): to take apart the identity categories and blur group boundaries.  This alternative angle, influenced by academic “constructionist” thinking, holds that sexual identities are historical and social products, not natural or intrapsychic ones.  It is socially produced binaries (gay/straight, man/woman) that are the basis of oppression; fluid, unstable experiences of self become fixed primarily in the service of social control.  Disrupting those categories, refusing 29  rather than embracing ethnic minority status, is the key to liberation.  In this deconstructionist politic, clear collective categories are an obstacle to resistance and change (p. 396). In other words, there is a divide between “deconstructive cultural strategies” and “category-supportive political strategies,” the “boundary strippers” and the “boundary-defenders” (Gamson, 1998). While one side sees the need for exclusive and secure identity boundaries for political effectiveness, Steven Seidman (2002) believes that identity is contingent on socially constructed norms that dictate the level of marginalization and alienation experienced by individuals in the LGBTQ community. Contemporary Gay and Lesbian Social Movement Contemporarily, gay communities and culture are no longer bounded solely by place, instead, these communities are held by common identities and interests. Relying on the use of community as typology, Max Weber (1978) makes a typological distinction between communal and associative relationships in Tönnies’ notions of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft. This distinction rests on different kinds of social action and is primarily expressive: [A] social relationship will be called “communal” if and so far as the orientation of social action—whether in the individual case, on the average, or in the pure type—is based on a subjective feeling of the parties, whether affectual or traditional, that they belong together (Weber, 1978 p. 40).   30  Communal relationships are based on “a subjective feeling of the parties that they belong to each other, that they are implicated in each other’s total existence” (Weber, 1978, p.40).  Associative relationships, on the other hand, are primarily instrumental: A social relationship will be called “associative” if and insofar as the orientation of social action within it rests on a rationally motivated adjustment of interests or a similarly motivated agreement, whether the basis of rational judgment be absolute values or reasons of expediency (Weber, 1978, pp. 40-41). Whether associative relationships lean towards strategic and goal-oriented or moral and ideological values, they “flow from rational calculation of interest rather than from emotional identification” (Nisbet, 1993, p. 80).  The communal type of relationship is marked by the absence of conflict; the associative, fraught with conflict.   Changes in the experience of the closet, the nature and forms of homophobia, and the social locations in which an increasing number of men and women come out result in a move away from the 19th and early 20th century conception of communities as “encompass[ing] all forms of relationship which are characterized by a high degree of personal intimacy, emotional depth, moral commitment, social cohesion, and continuity in time” (Nisbet, 1993, p. 47).  Although the concept of community has undergone several changes, place continues to play a large role in the LGBTQ community as some states and cities are more inclusive than others. Nonetheless, throughout the years, there have been improvements in inclusivity and the acquisition of gay rights. In “A Decade of Progress on LGBT Rights,” a report from the Movement Advancement Project (MAP) (2009), in 31  the years 2000-2009 a positive trend is depicted in areas such as “increases in the number of LGBTQ Americans protected by nondiscrimination and relationship recognition laws at the state level” and in “societal acceptance of LGBTQ people”. The report includes measures on a variety of key indicators including “safe and accepting school climate,” “protection from hate violence,” and “relief from HIV and AIDS,” among others. Less than a quarter of the eight key indicators measured are negative highlighting the overall positive trend in the progress of LGBTQ rights (MAP, 2009, p.1).  The timeline below highlights some of the most important events and legislation that have benefitted the LGBTQ community in the last few years: ● August 2009: Harvey Milk is posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama (CNN Library, 2017).  ● October 2009:  President Barack Obama signs the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, the first major federal gay rights legislation (CNN Library, 2017). ● December 2010: The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Policy” is repealed, allowing those that identify as LGBTQ to serve openly without fear of being dismissed from the military (CNN Library, 2017). ● March 2011: Under Former President Obama, The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education initiate a federal task force to provide resources to help parents and educators combat bullying. This campaign also funded the “It Gets Better” video that highlights the effects of bullying on LGBTQ youth (Office of the Press 32  Secretary, 2016). ● September 2012: The Democratic Party becomes the first US political party to publicly support same-sex marriage at the Democratic National Convention (CNN Library, 2017) ● December 2013: The Boy Scouts lift ban on Gay scouts (It Gets Better Project, 2016). ● July 2014: Former President Obama signs an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against any employee based on “race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin” (Office of the Press Secretary, 2016) ● June 2015: The United States Supreme Court legalizes same-sex marriage in the United States (It Gets Better Project, 2016). ● June 2016: Once the site of a violent uprising between the LGBTQ community in Greenwich Village and the local police force, The Stonewall Inn is declared a national monument (It Gets Better Project, 2016). ● April 2017: The 7th District Court of Appeals rules that the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination against LGBTQ employees (CNN Library, 2017). Perhaps the most significant indicator of progress would be the 2015 landmark Supreme Court decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, which states that denying marriage equality to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. This decision paved the way for 33  nationwide marriage equality, as prior to this decision only certain states recognized same-sex marriages. According to the Human Rights Campaign, over 60 percent of Americans support marriage equality, with only 35 percent against it (2017). Despite all this progress, several bills have been proposed that undermine marriage equality, uphold sexist policies and serve to further alienate and marginalize the LGBTQ community.  Although one can argue that progress has been made and that the level of alienation and marginalization has decreased in the LGBTQ community, one must be aware that such progress  is not experienced by all members of the community. In fact, according to Dr. Gordon Hodson (2013), “although attitudes are rapidly becoming more favourable, these attitudes are starting from a very low (i.e., unfavourable) starting point”. Perpetuating factors and obstacles such as homophobia, lack of acceptance, and lack of equal rights continue to affect the LGBTQ community on a daily basis.  Selected Conflict Resolution Theories The conflict resolution theories that follow were selected to consider their applicability to resolving conflict in the LGBTQ community: Johan Galtung’s structural violence (1969), Seàn Byrne & Neal Carter’s social cubism (1996), and Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (1943, 1954). Though these conflict resolution theories were not specifically created to resolve conflict in the LGBTQ community, they can provide much insight into the issues that plague this community. In “Violence, Peace, and Peace Research”, Galtung (1969) defines peace as the absence of violence. However, Galtung’s concept of violence is is not limited to physical harm, instead it is ingrained into social structures. According to Galtung, violence is 34  institutionalized in the social structure of a system to prevent certain individuals, particularly minorities, from moving forward or advancing. However, structural violence is not necessarily targeted at one particular individual, instead, it affects groups who share the same ethnic background, religion, sex, and/or ideology. Unlike other conflict resolution theories, structural violence focuses on the collective rather than the self (Galtung, 1969). When examining the LGBTQ community, there are several instances of structural violence that are rampant: institutionalized discrimination, neglect, misrepresentation, physical violence, and/or oppression (Human Rights Campaign, 2017).  The figure below highlights some of the factors that contribute to and maintain structural violence. The legal system, for example, has historically been detrimental to the LGBTQ community, as same-sex marriage was not recognized until the year 2015 (Human Rights Campaign, 2017).  Figure 1. Galtung’s Structural Violence model (1969) 35  Byrne and Carter’s social cubism (1996) model was initially developed to analyze ethnoterritorial conflicts in Northern Ireland and Quebec. Much like a “Rubic’s Cube”, social cubism identifies several sides to the “multi-faced puzzle”, or in this case the ethnoterritorial conflict (1996). In this model, a conflict is viewed and analyzed from various perspectives. This analytical framework allows the practitioner to see how various factors interplay with one another revealing the root or cause of the conflict. According to Byrne and Carter, to gain an understanding of the problem and to find a complete solution, one must look at all sides of the puzzle, or in this case, the cube (1996).  The figure below demonstrates the various factors, that shape the conflict: demographics, history, economic factors, religion, political factors, and psychocultural factors. Though the model identifies these six factors, some conflicts are more heavily affected by certain factors over others. However, all factors must be addressed to fully resolve the conflict ( Byrne & Carter, 1996).  Figure 2. Byrne and Carter’s Social cubism (1996) 36  Maslow’s hierarchy of needs was presented in his 1943 paper, “A Theory of Human Motivation”. The theory was then further developed in his 1954 book Motivation and Personality. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has become a foundational theory used across various disciplines to explain human motivation, drive, and needs (Burton, 2012). The model depicts the most fundamental needs (physiological needs) and culminates with the most complex needs (self-actualization needs) (Maslow, 1943; Maslow, 1954). The first level, physiological needs, refers to basic needs such as food, water, and sleep. The second level of needs, safety and security needs, refers to one’s needs to feel secure in terms of one’s body, finances, and resources. The third level, love and belonging needs, indicates one’s needs for friendship, family, and sexual intimacy. The next level, esteem needs, describes humans’ needs for self-esteem, confidence, achievement, and the respect of others. The final level of the pyramid, self-actualization, is reached when one attains their full potential in which one is able to pursue higher goals outside of themselves (spirituality and/or altruism) (Maslow, 1943; Maslow, 1954).  The five-level pyramid structure posits that humans must meet their most primitive needs prior to meeting the latter levels of the pyramid, or the more complex needs. In other words, one cannot achieve self-actualization without meeting the other four levels of the pyramid. The hierarchal nature of the pyramid becomes problematic for those that are unable to meet basic needs such as financial security and safety (Maslow, 1943; Maslow, 1954). Those that experience alienation and marginalization from their families and/or their communities will be unable to meet various levels of needs in the hierarchy. 37  The figure below demonstrates Maslow’s original hierarchy of needs as presented in 1943:  Figure 3. Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943) Gay Identity: Production and Context In his study of the creation of gay identity through cultural production and collective action, sociologist Stephen Valocchi (1999) argues that the development of gay identity is a class-inflected process. At the advent of gay culture and communities, white middle-class males, advantaged by their class, race, and gender, “were relatively better situated than other homosexuals to endure the hazards unleashed by their transgression of gender conventions and traditional heterosexual norms” (p. 87). While the gay political 38  identity of the burgeoning movement in the 1950s and 1960s—a time of assimilationist politics, as we will see in the next section—reflected the privileged position of its carriers, by the 1990s, gay identity had lost its political edge and had become a lifestyle category, which now privileged those with the means to assume (and consume) the identity (1999).   Through the process of “coming out,” gay and lesbian identities are formed in the changing contexts of homophobia and shapes of “the closet”. The “closet” refers to the systematic and institutional repression of homosexuality; while “coming out” refers to the individual or collective disclosure of homosexual identity in order to traverse “the closet” and its effects (Valocchi, 1999). According to historian George Chauncey (1995), “the closet” was not always an organizing feature of gay life. Prior to the 1950s, there was a high level of visibility and integration of gay and lesbian life. In the mid-20th century, the idea of “the closet” arised as middle-class anxieties about gender increased (Valocchi 1999), psychological constructions of homosexuality as a pathology was prevalent (McWhorter, 1999; Terry, 1999; Stein, 1999), the nation’s fear of communists and homosexuals (expressed most clearly in McCarthyism), and increasing public concerns about crime, met by politically motivated police crackdowns in gay bars and clubs, coalesced and highlighted the boundary between homosexuality and heterosexuality. Homosexuals were now labeled and viewed as “sinful”, “sick”, “criminal”, “transgressive monsters”, signifying danger and threatening society (D’Emilio, 1983.)   Following the Stonewall Riots of 1969, coming out became a political strategy employed by gay liberationists in the early 1970s (Armstrong & Crage, 2006). In the face 39  of the state’s condemnation of homosexuality, scientific models which pathologized homosexuals, and media representations of homosexuals as monsters, “coming out” originally signified much more than a personal disclosure of one’s own homosexuality. Instead, it was the individual expression of a collective political stance against homosexual oppression in general, a stance taken up in the context of urban gay communities in the 1970s (2006).  Over time, some of the major constitutive pieces of “the closet” have been dismantled.  As of 1973, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) no longer considers homosexuality as an aberrant disorder (Drescher, 2010), the state no longer criminalizes “sodomy” (Richards, 2009), media representations increasingly “normalize” gay and lesbian people (Walters, 2003) and social life and culture in the United States continues to move “beyond the closet” (Seidman, 2002). As a result of these changes, “coming out” has increasingly become a personal disclosure of one’s homosexuality, rather than a collective, political, oppositional posture. However, even with the increasing ease of disclosure, “coming out” today still occurs in the context of “homophobia.” Around the time that the American Psychological Association removed homosexuality from the DSM, social scientist and activist George Weinberg coined some “words for the new culture,” including “homophobia” (Weinberg, 1972). Focusing the issue of homosexuality in heterosexuals, rather than homosexuals, Weinberg defined “homophobia” as an irrational fear of homosexuals (1972). The term “homophobia” itself is cloaked in psychological terms and pathologizes anti-gay sentiment, whether merely thought or felt, or acted upon politically or through the use of 40  violence. While the term “homophobia” is politically useful for gay activists, recent scholarship has called for a re-theorizing and movement beyond it (Herek, 2004). Herek (2004) proposes that scholars consider various levels of sexual stigma and prejudice. “Sexual stigma” refers to “the shared knowledge of society’s negative regard for any non-heterosexual behavior, identity, relationship, or community”, knowledge that is shared by all members of a society (p. 37). “Heterosexism” refers to “the cultural ideologies that perpetuate sexual stigma,” “the systems that provide the rationale” for antipathy to the non-heterosexual, ideologies inscribed within institutions such as law and religion, and particularly the family.  “Sexual prejudice” refers to “individuals’ negative attitudes based on sexual orientation” (Herek, 2004 pp. 14-16). Unraveling the various threads that have been tied up in an ambiguous notion of “homophobia” permits greater conceptual clarification. These threads also contribute to a greater understanding of the ways in which alienation and marginalization occur through both external and internal sources for the LGBTQ community (Herek, 2004). By recognizing that all members of society share in the knowledge of sexual stigma, including gays and lesbians, we can examine the relationship between the management of that stigma on the part of gays and lesbians and the maintenance of heterosexism. Proponents of conservative, liberal, and radical gay political projects agree that “the closet” is an obstacle to progress and that sexual prejudices help construct that closet. The significance of coming out varies to the degree to which factions of the movement attempt to deconstruct heterosexism (Herek, 2004).  When liberationists cried, “Out of the closets and into the streets!” they were expressing a collective desire to come 41  out against straight society, its culture, and institutions. Gay conservatives, on the other hand, seem to individually desire admission to straight society, asking merely for a revision or exception to the ideologies that support sexual stigma (Herek, 2004).  In Epistemology of the Closet, Sedgwick (1990) argues that sexual identity and the desire that is generated from it create an important binary, which is predicated on the notion that there are two primary ways to view and integrate one’s self with the world. The first, the “minoritizing view,” states that there are people who are born with innate homosexual desires, and those born with this trait are the only ones who are genuinely interested in a homosexual view of the world. In this sense, a heterosexual man or woman may accept homosexuality, but in a deeper sense, the heterosexual individuals simply are not really interested (1990). In this sense, a minoritizing view is by definition restricted and simply less relevant to society in a broad sense. In contrast, the “universalizing view”, argues that issues related to “deviant” or alternative sexual behavior is important (1990). According to Sedgwick, there is no such thing as a stable sexual identity; for instance, people who identify as heterosexual might actually be bisexual or homosexual when it comes to their character traits (1990). Even a man who identifies and acts as a heterosexual male may demonstrate traits that society considers to fall outside of the heteronormative spectrum, such as wearing pink clothing or crying over romantic comedies. Sedgwick suggests that these actions allow the heterosexual man to identify to some degree with people who have different sexualities (1990).  The coming out experience is described by Sedgwick (1990) through two different perspectives, the liberationist and conservative. In the liberationist vein, coming 42  out refers to exploding the universal binary of gay/straight altogether, thus tearing down prevailing social arrangements of sexuality. While, coming out in a liberal way assumes the minority view embracing his/her identity and demanding that gay and straight be equally valued. Coming out in a conservative way may sometimes share this ideology with liberals, but also, contra liberationists. This is accomplished inasmuch as conservative gays acknowledge but downplay this identity, claiming not “to be gay,” as liberals may, but that they “just happen to be gay” and “gayness doesn’t define me” (1990). In this sense, the conservative view denies the possibility that “gayness” is an integral component of identity, in contrast to the more celebratory liberal position (1990). According to Sedgwick (1990), this division between the conservative viewpoint and the liberal or contra-liberationist viewpoint closely correlates with the spectrum of full integration and the practice of tolerance. From the liberal perspective, integration of LGBTQ individuals into mainstream society eliminates the need for tolerance, because these individuals and their identities are normalized and therefore become unremarkable. In contrast, the conservative perspective views homosexuality as something to be downplayed and tolerated. Conservative homosexuals seem reluctant to embrace sexuality as a defining characteristic. This approach would seem less troublesome if it were equally applied across a broad spectrum of comparable attributes, such as religion, nationality, and ethnic background. This does not, however, seem to be the case; the conservative approach appears to view sexuality as being unimportant, while often embracing these other attributes of identity. The discrepancy is significant within a broader dialogue regarding tolerance as it pertains to alienation and marginalization for 43  the LGBTQ community (Sedgwick, 1990). When addressing tolerance from a conservative approach, society, as a whole, tends to be more embracive and thus allows LGBTQ individuals to be integrated in society if one abides by the heteronormative expectations. As a result, the practice of tolerance, is more prevalent toward individuals that identify as LGBTQ and are more liberal or non-compliant with societal standards.    Judith Butler’s work on identity is vital to understanding intrapersonal conflict(s) as it relates to gender issues. As Butler (1988) states, a person’s identity and sense of belonging is always essentially contingent upon something else, and subjectivity is nearly impossible to achieve. From an intrapersonal perspective, the only way that an identity can be secured is through “performative acts”. Through the performance of one’s identity, an individual is progressively able to root that identity in material terms. However, not all performances of identity are socially accepted; according to Butler, “the cultural matrix through which gender identity has become intelligible requires that certain kinds of identities cannot exist (2007, p. 24). Further, there are a set amount of choices an individual can make as he/she identifies how they will perform their gender. In her book titled Judith Butler, Sarah Salih (2002), shares the  analogy of “a closet” to explain the restrictiveness of  gender performativity. In this “closet” individuals have a limited amount of “costumes” from which to make a “constrained choice of gender style” (p. 56). Salih (2002) explains, “gender is not something one is, it is something one does, an act, or more precisely, a sequence of acts, a verb rather than a noun, a ‘doing’ rather than a ‘being'” (p. 55). Salih clarifies, there is “no sex that is not always already a gender” (p.55).  44  An example of a “performative act” is when a transgender person behaves as his/her chosen gender, rather than his/her biological gender in public. An individual’s identity is entrenched and rooted through “performative acts\" that reinforce and stabilize the person’s sense of identity (Butler, 1988). In this way, the performance of identity becomes an interpersonal factor, as one’s identity is contingent upon society’s expectations. In other words, the expression of identity becomes a bi-directional relationship between the individual and society’s expectations of this individual. The expression of identity is informed by society and vice versa (1988). It is this performance, (whether or not the expected performance is performed), that can lead to alienation and marginalization in society. Members of the LGBTQ community have not met heterenormative expectations, when an individual is unable or refuses to perform the identity that is expected, their ability to integrate is compromised thus contributing to the tolerance of the LGBTQ community rather than full integration (1988).  Our sense of identity, as unsteady as it may be, is very useful from an epistemological perspective because it allows a person to view the world in a particular way (Butler, 2007). In other words, a person who identifies and performs his identity as a heterosexual man will view the world differently than one that makes a conscious shift in that performance and identifies as a cross-dressing man, for example. When understood in a contingent manner, identity allows a person to find their place in the world and to consider the different forms of agency that emerge from that identity. The primary concept to be understood through Butler’s extensive work in this area is that intrapersonal 45  factors, such as gender and identity, allow us to create a sense of belonging within the framework of the world, however weak that sense of integration might be (2007).  Although the work of Michel Foucault will be discussed more in depth later on in this dissertation, it is worth briefly noting his important contribution to the literature on intrapersonal identity formation. Foucault (1978) reinforces the epistemological importance of sexual identity and argues that a sense of identity, specifically sexual identity, allows the individual to take on an “imaginary” identity that can be reconstructed in a contingent manner. In short, identity gives a person an intrapersonal or subjective view of the world because it offers a protective shield from the world and allows an individual to reconstruct their relationship with the world as real interactions with other individuals take place (1978). Like Butler and Sedgwick, Foucault’s concept of identity is flexible; he interjects a high degree of contingency in identity formation.  In a similar way, recent work by Baumann (2013) supports the concept of contingent identity and states that an age of “liquid modernity” has been brought forth by the beginning of the age of globalization. Globalization has, in a broad sense, removed certainties relating to knowledge and identity. In this framework, individuals have “provisional identities,” meaning that individuals do not construct their identity according to binaries, but rather questions of identity remain necessarily fluid. For example, a person who may have outgrown or primarily discarded a religious, racial, or sexual identity may not have discarded it in its entirety. Through this view, the terms “heterosexual” and “homosexual” cease to have meaning, because these terms rely upon binaries. A person might behave in a heterosexual or homosexual manner at one juncture 46  in time, but in a different manner at another juncture in time. No identity is concrete; all identities are fluid. This reliance upon fluidity, in contrast with binary frameworks, is a result of the growing trend towards diversity, both in society and for the individual (Baumann 2013).  Considering these different views is helpful when understanding intrapersonal/ interpersonal conflict as it relates to identity formation. Factors such as identity and gender directly impact the level of alienation and marginalization experienced by those that identify as LGBTQ. As such, the way in which one expresses their identity and gender is directly correlated with his/her ability to be integrated versus tolerated. Symbolic Interactionism and Identity Formation According to Blumer (1969), symbolic interactionism is a social theory developed from the work of Charles Horton Cooley and George Herbert Mead in the early twentieth century. According to this ideology, individuals live in a world that is sociologically constructed. In particular, the meaning of objects, events, and behaviors are derived from the interpretation people give them, and interpretations vary from one group to another (Blumer, 1969). Symbolic interactionism attempts to explain the understanding that exists between the self and the social sphere. This ideology revolves around the belief that our perception of the self is a direct consequence of our social connection and our social nexus. In Berkeley’s (1963) concept of direct perception, symbols as well as indirect perception, can also be used when describing symbolic interactionism. In direct perception, individuals see an object for what the object appears to be to the individual perceiving the information. For example, if person x sees object y, then y will be to x 47  what x perceives the object to be. At this point, the object has no meaning, it is only what the individual perceives the object to be. The object being perceived is only a shape. However, once the shape has meaning, it becomes a symbol. A symbol then, is no longer an object without meaning, but a representation of what is being perceived. Moreover, in indirect perception, the incorporation of meaning takes place of an object thus, making the object being perceived indirectly. This example relates to the concept of social interactionism in that an object is not what one perceives the object to be, but what society—through its shared meaning of the object has dictated one’s perception to be. The identity of the object is then only as valid as the definition created for it through social interaction (J. Campbell, personal communication, September 3, 2011).    When relating this concept to gender and gender roles, the determination of how individuals should/ought to behave and act is a direct result of what society has determined to be appropriate or inappropriate according to their biological sex. The expectation of behavior according to sex is decided by societal norms and schemas. These expectations shape the understanding of the self and determine the inclusion or exclusion of an individual in society (Lorber, 1994). Under this ideology, to determine the moral of your actions, the action is compared to the general behavior exhibited by a society. If the behavior is deemed acceptable or common by society, then it is considered to be acceptable for the individual. However, if once the behavior is compared to the standard or general behavior exhibited by society and is not matched or common, the behavior would be considered unacceptable (Lorber, 1994).  48  This ideology is exhibited in a patriarchy. In a patriarchal system, gender roles are divided based on social norms and schemas which have been established by the social nexus of individuals. In this system, women are repressed and men praised. Although the feminist movement has allowed women to understand that they do not have to accept a system that favors males over females and gives public power to a specific sex, women still find it difficult to redefine their roles in society and disregard predetermined behavior as result of their sex (Stacey & Thorne, 1985).     Wiley (1991) states, “the gendered quality of self is not biologically given, but created from social demands and responses to those demands” (p. 77). In the process of self- identification, individuals identify themselves by a certain group or label. Individuals then act and behave in ways in which the group they have identified themselves with acts or behaves. This process is interconnected and determines what is considered to be socially correct under the shared meaning of a particular group. A failure to fit the shared meaning of what has been determined as appropriate behavior undercuts the validity and credibility of the integration of the individual in that particular group (1991). This, in turn, contributes to the interpersonal conflict that members of the LGBTQ community experience. In social interactionism, an individual’s perception of oneself is only as valid and accurate as their social nexus believes it to be. This reinforces the concept of this ideology, which states that individuals, in fact, define their identity as a result of social interactions and their social nexus. In relation to sex, behavioral expectations are socially produced and are internalized by individuals as part of their identities and being (Connell, 49  1987). In a patriarchal society, a woman's identity and sense of self is determined by society’s interpretation of gender roles, thus creating a predetermined schema as it relates to appropriate behavior of what a woman is supposed to be. In order to feel validated or accepted by society, a need for assimilation and subjugation is adopted by women under this system, burdening them to the constraints and limitations of empowerment and liberation (1987).  When describing the interaction with the self, symbolic interactionism states that how individuals view themselves is a direct result of our historical interactions with society and how, based on those experiences, we develop our definition of self. Under this ideology, if an individual considers himself male, but his experiences and interactions with individuals have led him to believe he is female, then his self-concept and how he sees himself will inevitably be skewed. Self-concept is then not so much about the self, but it is once again contingent on what the social nexus has defined the individual to be (Blumer, 1969). In other words, it is only through the approval or disapproval of society, that what individuals view or consider themselves to be is valid or is nothing more than faulty perception. When considering the LGBTQ community, such skewed comparisons as it relates to what others define symbols or norms to be, as compared to one’s definition, can create a dissonance in the individual and/or community increasing the level of interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict they experience (1969).   Intersectionality of Identity Intersectional theory was first developed by Kimberle Crenshaw (1989). Crenshaw studied the way in which overlapping identities magnify or enhance the 50  spectrum of discrimination and oppression that exists in relation to sexual and ethnic minorities. Intersectional theory, therefore, deals with both the sociological and the legal aspects pertaining to the manner in which the overlapping of different identities can interact with the state of domination and privilege that exists in relation to LGBTQ people.  Intersectional theory examines how the different cultural components that form part of the identity of a person explain the position of oppressed minorities within society (Crenshaw, 1989). Additionally, it describes how such identities overlap or intersect into one another. While there were attempts in the past to create theoretical frameworks that would look at discrimination within each particular group of minority identities, intersectional theory looks at all the different elements involved within the formation of a person’s identity. The elements that intersectional theory entail include the gender, color, and race of an LGBTQ individual (Hutchinson, 2001). Intersectional theory looks at how the elements of color, race and or ethnic origin magnify the spectrum of discrimination that an LGBTQ person might experience.  Intersectional theory has significant implications for understanding how social inequalities become entrenched in society. Social inequalities become more visible when one analyzes the different forms of discrimination that affect the different social groups (Phoenix & Pattynama, 2006). There is a multi-layered dimension to social injustice that needs to take into consideration the different forms of oppression. From this perspective, it can be postulated that the different forms of bigotry that exist in society, for example racism, homophobia and xenophobia, should not be regarded as independent events 51  (Taylor, Hines & Casey, 2010). Conversely, they are part of a continuum of different forms of discrimination. At the same time, intersectional theory introduces some interesting perspectives regarding the concept of identity. The enactment of one’s identity does not take place in accordance to singular experiences. For instance, it is not possible to look at issues pertaining to LGBTQ people from the perspective of sexual orientation only. It is also important to take into consideration the way in which class, race, age (amongst other variables) interact with the sexual identity (Diamond & Butterworth, 2008). Moreover, intersectional theory points out the existence of more subtle forms of subjugation. These forms of subjugation are responsible for entrenching social injustice among sexual minorities. This is an aspect of intersectional theory that has been highlighted by Crenshaw (1991): Where systems of race, gender, and class domination converge, as they do in the experiences of battered women of color, intervention strategies based solely on the experiences of women who do not share the same class or race backgrounds will be of limited help to women who because of race and class face different obstacles (p. 1246). It is important to add that intersectionality is necessarily an open-ended term that has to be contextualized according to the situational factors that affect the person’s identity at any given juncture. There is a strong sociological element attached to intersectional theory (Phoenix & Pattynama, 2006). This element occurs because this theoretical framework became prominent during the 1960s, when feminism underwent a 52  revisionist period. Feminist theoreticians looked at the social factors affecting the position of women in society, not just from the perspective of gender but also taking into consideration other factors, such as race and sexual orientation (2006). Intersectional theory brought into the limelight the idea that the discrimination that is suffered by a woman of white, middle-class origin differs in a significant manner from the experience of women of color and LGBTQ orientation (Crenshaw, 1991). The individuals who belong to more than one oppressed social group are bound to experience a higher level of discrimination than members of other oppressed social groups because there are distinguishing factors between the two groups. This has considerable implications for the manner in which discrimination against LGBTQ people takes place in society. The bias and bigotry experienced by an LGBTQ individual may have aspects in common with the bigotry expressed towards a cisgender person of a minority race, but the two experiences are distinct in many ways (Davis, 2008). Furthermore, there are differences even within the LGBTQ community. The experience of a gay man, for instance, may differ significantly from the experience of a transsexual woman (Taylor et al., 2010). There are sociological factors that may enhance the situation of oppression that takes place against this social group, taking into consideration aspects related to class, race, and gender. The intersectional dimension of identity is also important in order to understand the makeup of society. This is because there are social and economic hierarchies that emerge from the way that different forms of identity are categorized within mainstream society. Crenshaw (1989) states: 53  It is somewhat ironic that those concerned with alleviating the ills of racism and sexism should adopt such a top-down approach to discrimination. If their efforts instead began with addressing the needs and problems of those who are most disadvantaged and with restructuring and remaking the world where necessary, then others who are singularly disadvantaged would also benefit. In addition, it seems that placing those who currently are marginalized in the center is the most effective way to resist efforts to compartmentalize experiences and undermine potential collective action (p. 167). Intersectionality is a means through with the process of compartmentalization can be understood and mitigated. There are three different ways in which the study of intersectional theory can be approached. Intersectional theory can be a tool used in order to deconstruct analytical categories that have been long entrenched by the prevalence of the patriarchy. This can be termed the anti-categorical approach (Hutchinson, 2001). According to this approach, one may argue that the social categories that underpin the patriarchal social system are constructed in an arbitrary fashion. The anti-categorical approach enables us to understand the way that different social groups experience life in society. One of the main tenets that is held by the anti-categorical approach is the need to get rid of the categories that are used in order to oppress the different sections of society (2001). In other words, by labeling individuals as “gay,” or “lesbian,” society is pigeonholing these individuals into abstract categories ignoring that sexuality is a fluid concept that does not 54  have to be put into rigid categories (Diamond & Butterworth, 2008). This is an aspect that has been broached by Phoenix and Pattynama (2006): [Intersectionality] foregrounds a richer and more complex ontology than approaches that attempt to reduce people to one category at a time. It also points to the need for multiplex epistemologies. In particular, it indicates that fruitful knowledge production must treat social positions as relational. Intersectionality is thus useful as a handy catchall phrase that aims to make visible the multiple positioning that constitutes everyday life and the power relations that are central to it (p.188). Intersectionality, therefore, is a safeguard against reducing or limiting members of the LGBTQ community into a particular “box” or label. A second approach is the inter-categorical approach, which takes the evolving relationship that exists between the different social groups within society into consideration (Hutchinson, 2001). These relationships are an aspect of paramount importance to appraise the way in which the different categories relating to a person’s identity may enhance or reduce the spectrum of discrimination that affects that person. There is a level of complexity that arises from the inter-categorical approach that enables us to appreciate the different nuances that exist within the spectrum of discrimination that is a reality within society (Hutchinson, 2001; Phoenix & Pattynama, 2006). At the same time, this approach allows us to appreciate the ambiguities that are attached to the concept of identity and the way that they impact on the spectrum of discrimination. 55  Diamond and Butterworth (2008) underlines the fluid nature of sexual identity and its link to the question of social discrimination: Dichotomous models of gender have been criticized for failing to represent the experiences of individuals who claim neither an unambiguously female nor male identity […] [t]he feminist theoretical framework of intersectionality provides a generative approach for interpreting these experiences of gender multiplicity […] [there is a great value in the use] of intersectionality as a framework for understanding not only multiplicity across identity constructs (e.g.., race, gender, etc.) but also within identity constructs (i.e., female and male) (p. 365). The ambiguity of LGBTQ identity, therefore, necessarily calls for intersectionality in order to encompass the many overlapping categories that exist within the LGBTQ framework.  The third approach to intersectional theory can be defined as an intra-categorical approach. This approach posits that there are significant flaws in the way in which the different social categories pertaining to identity are outlined (Hutchinson, 2001). Unlike the first approach, the anti-categorical approach, this perspective does not rebut the importance of being able to put labels on different social groups. On the contrary, theorists who adopt this approach believe that the configuration of categories and labels is a necessary prerequisite in order to reduce the social inequalities within the different social groups. The emphasis given by this approach resides in the fact that these theorists focus on giving labels to groups that are marginalized within society (Taylor et al., 2010). For instance, these theorists focus on transgender people who are in non same-sex 56  relationships and the way that these individuals may be treated by mainstream society. According to this approach, the delineation of taxonomical boundaries is important for the purposes of understanding the ways that the different social groups interact with one another (Hutchinson, 2001). The interrelationship between the three different approaches provides an evaluation of the subjective and intersubjective dimensions relating to the question of identity. The complex social environment that exists in modern societies details that the individual is almost at the mercy of the implications that stem from the manner in which sexual identity is categorized by the different members of society. There is an arbitrariness that is connected to sexual categories that deeply affects the insertion of LGBTQ people into society (Nisbet, 1993).   The LGBTQ individual is often compelled to undertake his or her insertion into society by making reference to categories that may not correspond with the individual’s sense of true identity. In this way, labels such as “butch”, “fem”, “queer”, or “dyke” might become tools for empowerment but may also have a detrimental effect on the way in which the individual is able to integrate with society (Herek, 2004). Taylor, et al. (2010) explain that the enactment of categories that do not correspond with the real identity of the person creates an internal and external conflict: Debates on 'intersections' force an awareness of the social divisions that are thought of as enduring, as against those that are seen as simply old and settled variously casting inequalities as added extras, with constituent parts of ‘class, 'gender', 'sexuality' added or scored out in accordance with academic trend ( p. 1). 57  In other words, there is a tendency to inject rigid categories that do not really correspond to the real identity of the individual. At the same time, to navigate the societal environment, LGBTQ people are compelled to adopt the categorizations that have been demarcated by the majoritarian groups that are responsible for disseminating narratives of domination (Herek, 2004). There is, within the superstructure of domination, a process of stratification within the different social groups belonging to the larger LGBTQ community. Through this process of stratification, certain groups are able to attain a higher taxonomical status whereas others tend to be more marginalized (Taylor et al., 2010). For example, there is a trend towards accepting people who identify as having a same-sex sexual orientation, both in the workplace and in society at large. However, in these same arenas, there currently seem to be more difficulties with integrating transgender individuals. This disparity indicates a degree of stratification and hierarchy even within the LGBTQ community. Pompper (2014) highlights the complexities inherent in the process of ontological stratification that prevails within each marginalized group and the manner in which this impacts the enhancement of the spectrum of discrimination that exists within modern societies: Those who embrace multiplicity of social identity dimensions and explore how they intersect also posit that uneven power distribution in a society complicates situated identities by more firmly entrenching some people at the center and others in the margins. Researchers dedicated to dismantling infrastructures supporting inequality and desirous of elevating multi-textured voices of the 58  disenfranchised are drawn to intersectional analyses. Overall, intersectionality scholars question perceived group homogeneity, essentialist categories, and argue that there are substantial intra-group differences (p. 45). It is important to add that the inter-relational facets pertaining to the question of discrimination also affect the marginalized social groups. Social groups that are subject to the oppressive discourse projected by a majoritarian group adopt discriminatory practices by acquiring the same labels that serve to their marginalization (Pompper, 2014). Indeed, Hutchinson (2001) argues that the discriminatory discourse that is projected towards minority groups has been appropriated by the marginalized segments of society to discriminate against other minority groups: Feminists of color and other critical scholars have examined racism and patriarchy as \"intersecting\" phenomena, rather than as separate and mutually exclusive systems of domination […] The powerful intersectionality model has also inspired many other avenues of critical engagement. Lesbian-feminist theorists, for example, have challenged the patriarchy and heterosexism of law and sexuality and feminist theorists, respectively, and, recently, a growing intellectual movement has emerged that responds to racism within gay and lesbian circles and heterosexism within antiracist activism. These \"post-intersectionality\" scholars are collectively pushing jurists and progressive theorists to examine forms of subordination as interrelated, rather than conflicting, phenomenon (p. 285). 59  The implications of the push and pull between subjective and intersubjective representations of identity are important to gain real knowledge regarding the superstructure of domination and privilege that exists in society (Nisbet, 1993). The process of categorization entails that certain social groups are able to place categories on other social groups in order to consolidate privileges that are upheld by society at large. In this manner the process of differentiation that is part and parcel of the way that social groups are categorized serves as a force for entrenching the state of oppression towards certain groups, including LGBTQ people (Diamond & Butterworth, 2008).  When analyzing this theory from an LGBTQ lens, the way an individual expresses him or herself at work may not be the same way he/she identifies themselves at home or when they are out with friends. Such separations of self-expression result due to their inability to feel safe and accepted in several environments. The ability for self-expression or lack thereof can lead to both intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict(s) for the individual.  Patriarchy and Gender Throughout time, women have struggled to gain the equality, respect, and equal rights that men have been inherently given. Because of deeply entrenched patriarchy in our society, the equality has been a complicated endeavor to pursue and achieve for women. For the purposes of this discussion, patriarchy can be understood as an ideology in which men are morally, intellectually, and physically superior to women thus, having the right to rule them. This school of thought is still prevalent in some aspects of society in the United States and throughout cultures all over the world. Even in what some may 60  call evolving times, women are still struggling for rights that most men take for granted. A prime example is the income disparity that continues to plague women in the workplace.  Feminism and feminist theory arose to support the nature of gender equality and to counter patriarchy (Eisenstein, 1983). Feminism can be viewed as a precursor to queer theory and, in many respects, paved the way for a broader discussion of sexual rights. According to feminist criticism, the basis of discrimination against women has been embedded in Western culture and ideology for years. The concept of female empowerment and equality may seem to many like a normal and obvious concept, particularly for someone currently living in an urban area of the United States. However, it can easily be forgotten that not too many years ago, this country deprived women of basic rights, such as the right to vote, which is an integral component of the American lifestyle. In a time where women are empowered and seek equal treatment, history can be rewritten. More and more women are challenging themselves as well as societal roles set forth by others to seek what they have been fighting for since the beginning of the feminist movement in the 1970s: acknowledgement, validation and equality (Einstein, 1983). Gender discrimination promotes certain fallacies, such as the notion that males are inherently superior, and females inferior, thus making one the ruler and the other one the ruled. These myths of gender misrepresent the relationships between men and women (Eisenstein, 1983). In a world where men are considered powerful beings and women subservient, power is distributed according to an individual’s sex, thus relegating them to 61  different sectors in society.  A critical theoretical template that promotes this belief is that of biological essentialism, a theory which states that individuals have an innate/biological predisposition according to their biological sex to perform better at certain tasks than the other. As a result of this theory, roles have been polarized and created accordingly for men and women (Bem, 1994). Within this template, men, who as indicated earlier are considered superior, have been assigned to the public sector. Women, in contrast, have been linked to more domestic private sectors. The public sector includes areas such as: politics, societal representation, workforce, positions of power, as well as any other duty relating to public exposure. On the other hand, women are relegated to the private sector in which they are expected to perform duties such as: raising children, cooking, cleaning, household chores as well as any other task inside the home. Since this school of thought has been accepted as reality and common practice for centuries, women and men conform to the cultural ideas/schemas established by society without at times, daring to challenge their personal beliefs or ideologies (Bem, 1994). Such schemas can result in intrapersonal as well as interpersonal conflict when individuals do not abide to such standards. Although the conflict begins at the intrapersonal level with an individual realizing that such social standards do not coincide with their identity and/or gender, it then becomes an interpersonal conflict once it is expressed and the social nexus dictates how one should act, behave, and feel (Bem, 1994).  To secure the power and maintain the roles relegated to individuals by society, men build a system of power and control in order to have the winning hand against women (Lerner, 1986). Kaufman (2000), states that a world controlled by men, is by 62  definition, a world of power and control. Men enjoy social power and the many forms of privilege associated with being a male. The results of the practice of power, or patriarchy, have been strongly challenged by feminists with Egalitarianism. Bertens (2001) states: “Feminism tends to change the power relations between men and women that prevail under what in the late 1960s and 1970s usually was called a patriarchy, a term that referred to the almost complete domination of men in Western Society and beyond” (p. 96).   Under a patriarchal ideology, women and men play certain roles and are viewed within the context of a hierarchy, one in which the two sexes are unequal in society. Both men and women are expected to behave and live their lives based on the schema created by society constructed on an individual’s sex. The biological determinist approach further explains the function that a patriarchal system plays in society and its purpose. The prime role and purpose of this ideology is the subjugation of women. In this ideology, women are powerless and only have the control of that given to them by men in the privacy of their home. In this framework, any public exposure that showcases women’s talents or attributes is a foreign concept (Bertens, 2001).  Another function this ideology serves is that of promoting the notion that a woman’s existence as defined by a man’s. Under this dogma, a culture of inequality is enacted by placing women’s existence as dependent of that of men, implying that their identity is defined based on men’s identity, and thus perpetuating patriarchy. This is historically evident in various ways. For instance, in the United States (and many other countries), when a woman marries, it is common practice for the woman to adopt her 63  husband’s last name, giving up her maiden name. This practice serves to honor the husband and to fully acknowledge the marriage to society. Some women, however, decide to hyphenate their last name and keep their maiden name. These women, commonly perceived as more “liberal” or as feminists do so to acknowledge their maiden name and/or to not feel as their husband’s property. However, it can be argued that even this tactic still attaches women to men, for a woman’s maiden name is given to her by her father. As such, it is notable that even the most personal characteristics an individual woman can possess, such as a name, which signifies personal identity, is also related to a man.  These traditional and common practices are a challenge to feminism and enforce patriarchy.  Interestingly, with the concept of heterosexual normativity, a concept in which homosexual rights are opposed and not acknowledged unless they provide a direct pleasure to the man, biases are once again in place to benefit such gender thus displaying subjugation for women. For example, in a patriarchal system, sexual relationships between two men or two women are not accepted. However, a “threesome,” an experience that consists of two women with a man and that involves same-sex activity between the women while the man is present is more socially acceptable because the man will gain pleasure from the experience (J. Campbell, personal communication, September 20, 2011). One can state that this once again demonstrates a detailed bias towards men. According to Babbitt (1993), “Understanding the experiences of the oppressed group does not appear to be sufficient unless it involves some kind of transformation experience, particularly of the sort that results in the unsettling of the person’s self and 64  position” (p.256). The necessity for an element of “unsettlement” as described here by Babbitt is useful both in understanding the power dynamic between men and women, but also in extrapolating this power dynamic to the alienation and oppression experienced by many members of the LGBTQ community (1993). Employing the example of a threesome, the same-sex activity is only acceptable when it benefits men; however, same-sex relationships that do not benefit heterosexual men are not acceptable in society (Babbitt, 1993). As long as patriarchy remains prevalent in society, women and other minorities (including the LGBTQ community) will need to work harder in order to change social perceptions of these groups. According to Wilson (1983), the ongoing entrenchment of patriarchy is perpetuated because most men are hesitant to change and are unwilling to cater to the idea of the evolution of the equality of women. It is certain that some men have changed, particularly within younger generations, and there have been some shifts in the dominant ideology and practices they pursue. In order to successfully overthrow patriarchy in its entirety, a shift must be made by both men and women, in which men must become aware of the disparity in treatment they have had and still have to this day for being men (Ruether, 1992).  For centuries, men have subjugated women in many different arenas. One of the most powerful and relevant examples that showcases the disparity between men and women throughout history can be found in the Bible. Lerner (1986) states: The best example of the metaphors of gender in the Bible have been those of Woman, created by a Man’s rib, and of Eve, the temptress, causing humankind’s 65  fall from grace. These have, for over two millennia, been cited as proof of divine sanction for the subordination of women. As such, they have had a powerful impact on the defining values and practices in regard to gender relations. While it is to be expected that interpretations of a poetic, mythical, and folkloristic composite such as the book of Genesis would vary so as to fit the needs of interpreters, we should note that the tradition of interpretation has been overwhelmingly patriarchal and the various feminist interpretations made by individual women in the past seven hundred years have been made against an entrenched and theologically sanctioned tradition long antedating Christianity (p. 183).  Using the tenets of Christianity as a support, sexism and inequality has been rampant throughout the centuries and has continued well into the twentieth century. For example, it was not uncommon in the 1960s for women who were searching for jobs to open the newspaper and find two lists of employment advertisements: one for men, and another for women. Not surprisingly, the jobs available to men were challenging positions with the potential to climb the professional ladder of success, while those available to women were typically low-paying and clerical jobs. Regardless of their education or professional skills, women were frequently excluded from opportunities in the workplace for simply being women. Those women who did establish careers were at times paid 50% percent less of what was paid to a man for the same work (Lerner, 1986). As noted previously, income disparity between women and men is an aspect of patriarchy that is ongoing even in the present day. 66  From the 1970s onward, there began to be some subtle changes in the way that traditional gender roles were perceived and manifested - families of the 1980s and 1990s placed a higher priority on sharing responsibilities and strove further for equality for both men and women within the partnership of marriage (Thornton, 1989). According to a survey conducted by Thornton (1989), individuals in the 1980s and the 1990s were more prone to agree that it was appropriate for married women to have their own careers as well as be good mothers, that married men should do some household chores and assist in child rearing responsibilities and lastly, that wives should have an equal vote when making family decisions. These changes, however, are a direct threat to a patriarchal system because they support the notion of allowing women to gain a sense of independence as well as a taste of equality. One of the most common forms of criticism to this concept, is an assumption that (non-traditional) families in which women work and seek equality similar to that of their husband, are not successful in child rearing when compared with those families that practice more traditional beliefs (Goldberg, 1989). Consequently, in relation to religious conceptions and traditional values, conservatives state that families that adopt liberal and feminist ideologies are minimizing “American” values and negatively affect the wellbeing of their children. Conservatives also state that women who seek careers, aspire to be professionals, and demand equal and fair treatment are in fact rejecting the inherited biological traits and characteristics which are mandated as a result of their sex (Goldberg, 1989).  67  In contrast, more liberal scholars and commentators argue that although there is in fact change in the family structure when comparing families today to families in the 1950s and 1960s, family life is not declining. Instead, supporters of gender equality explain that the modern family, with its greater degree of fluidity in gender roles, represents an improvement over conservative families as they provide and promote feelings of worthiness and equality for both partners. Feminists, in particular, view the conservative concept of family as merely another way of controlling women and continuing the patriarchal system that many conservatives still want to enforce (Stacey, 1993).   Due to the feminist movement, society has seen many of the obstacles set forth by men under a patriarchal system slowly improve towards the benefit of women who seek equality. A survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (1992), stated that more than two-thirds of married women who were raising children were also part of the workforce assisting their husbands with breadwinning responsibilities. Additionally, a survey conducted by Pleck (1985), stated that men had increased the amount of time assisting their wives in childrearing responsibilities as well as performing household chores.  Although gender neutrality, by definition, is inclusive and is supposed to support women in a time where they are seeking equality and justice, it can also have devastating ramifications. For instance, holding women as accountable as men in a society that does not provide the same opportunities and discriminates against them is an additional barrier they face (Pleck, 1985). As stated by Bem (1994), the gender neutrality discussion has 68  historically directly affected women in divorce settlements; this is because there was the misconception that as equal beings, they would be able to have the same opportunities for finding employment and earn the same wages as men thus providing equal benefits for such settlements for men and women. This resulted in women suffering consequences because they are limited to the possibilities offered to them (Bem, 1994). Although there is a movement for equality, there is no movement for the deconstruction of the patriarchal ideology that limits the opportunities afforded to women. Instead of helping, this disparity hinders women. The goal should be twofold: for equality to be present while also increasing programs and strategies to support women. Once both ideas are implemented, true equality will help women. Otherwise, it will not be truly beneficial (Bem, 1994).  When feminists first began to refer to gender in the 1970s, the purpose was to note a difference from what we are biologically destined to be—sex, from the label that society instills in us—gender (Chowdrow, 1989). Traditional gender roles in society have been determined based on biological structure. A strong movement forward by the feminist movement and nontraditional ideologies has restructured the definition and behavior expectations regarding men and women. In society, the role of a man and a woman is influenced by various factors and societal schemas based on their gender. Therefore, in society gender polarization can be defined as the role by which an individual is to abide by as a result of their biological sex (Bem, 1994). With the awareness that individuals have expectations as to how to behave, the type of profession to choose, the level of education to pursue or how to act in society according to their 69  biological sex, an individual’s idea of self-identity and liberation is skewed by compromising to give in to a societal indoctrination as to how to live their life (Chowdrow, 1989). As a result of the expectations of behavior according to an individual’s sex, individuals often attempt to fit the schema dictated by society and disregard their own wants and needs.  Butler (1997) states that as a result of social interaction, males and females adopt certain roles associated to their sex. Males are usually more interested in or perform physically tough activities like, weightlifting, and highly physical jobs whereas females perform tasks like raising children, cooking, sewing, and clerical/secretarial positions. The way in which gender roles are learned and assimilated by a group of individuals creates the socialization concept and thus, such roles became engraved and adopted by individuals according to their biological sex (Butler, 1990).  When differentiating between sex and gender, many individuals are confused regarding what these terms mean and how humans are classified as a result of the interpretation of these definitions. The sex of an individual is defined by our anatomy, while the gender of an individual is determined sociologically (Ridgeway and Correll, 2004). According to Ridgeway and Correll (2004): The argument that people are always and everywhere accountable to gendered norms presupposes the perception that people are always gendered. Gender, according to this claim, is a master status that overrides any other role of status. Regardless of whether one is interacting with a doctor, lawyer, or car mechanic, the perception of that person and therefore interaction with him or her is filtered 70  through the lenses of gender. We pay attention and process that the doctor is female, the lawyer is male and so is the car mechanic. This theory of status expectations, which describes the process by which female disadvantage is continually reproduced, rests on the assumption that sex is a master status. When sex category is activated, the stereotypes associated with it are also automatically activated. Thus, in a wide variety of situations men are automatically viewed as more competent, giving those advantages that can easily lead them to self-fulfilling prophecies (p. 120).  As Ridgeway and Correll posit, these gendered expectations are so socially ingrained that they become self-fulfilling. A study conducted by Thorne (1993), analyzed the way in which gender specific expectations were placed on children in elementary schools as a result of societal gender schemas. It was found that according to an individual’s sex, there were several roles that these students were indirectly forced to assume and to abide by. If these individuals did not conform to these expectations, the result was that they experienced bullying, alienation and segregation. The study revealed that boys were expected to engage in physically engaging games, while girls were expected to demonstrate a concern with forming groups and communicating about friendship and boys. These behaviors are not only limited to elementary schools, but also exist in both middle and high school. As adults, the disparities and biases related to expectations and behaviors towards individuals as they relate to gender still prevail (Thorne, 1993). Ridgeway and Correll (2004) state:  71  We make many of our decisions about allocating resources and responsibilities in social groups and these groups use gender specific expectations for determining who will exert influence on decision making. We are much more willing to be influenced by men than women: in the absence of information, we will assume that men have competence but that woman do not. Men’s ability to exert influence seems independent of their interactional style or their apparent motivation. Whether and on what terms we are willing to be influenced by women depends on what gender we are. Men are more willing to be influenced by women who speak tentatively and express priorities on group interests. Thus, women interacting with men are forced to choose between having influence and being seen as competent. All women groups, on the other hand, are more willing to be influenced by women who speak and appear to be self-interested, but women like group oriented women, more so women in female groups must choose between having influence and being liked (p. 151). Gender differences and biases are not only limited to the household and the school environment, but also the work environment. As women become more empowered and seek to escape from the private sector, they continue to face many obstacles in their search for equality and freedom. A study conducted by Martin (1996), found that managers perceive men to have an advantage over women to climb the professional ladder as a result of their added intellect and commitment to the job. This results in an increased amount of training and added resources for professional development and growth in the company. Women, on the other hand, have a disadvantage over men in this 72  regard, as managers do not allocate the same amount of time and dedication as they do for men. The study went on to find that when evaluating both men and women on work performance, managers reinforce and motivate men to seek and continue to strive for professional growth minimizing their failures. In the case of women, the behavior exhibited by their managers is completely the opposite. In his study, Martin (1996), states that this behavior is exhibited because of the belief that men are individuals of power and control in the workforce and are the ones who, under a traditional and patriarchal belief, will in turn continue to grow and succeed in the company.  According to Deutsch (2007), to eliminate the system of oppression and inequality for women the key changes include:  […] affirmative action, equal pay and comparable worth, open information about wages, bureaucratic accountability for work related evaluations, and family friendly workplace policies. All these entail structural changes. These structural changes would promote changes at the interactional level by undermining the perception that women are less competent than men in the domains that matter. Incremental effects that flow from this changed perception produce gender equality (p. 118).  Unfortunately, these structural changes are slow to come as they depend on changing individuals’ perceptions. Chafetz’s (1990), theory of gender equity also states the interaction between the structural and interactional levels:   Technological change and economic expansion is key to changes in the gender system because they increase women’s access to resource-producing roles. 73  Specifically, increased job opportunities, for women mean that they can earn money and become less economically dependent on men. An increase in resources increases women’s micro level power within the family and, at the macro level, contributes to the development of gender consciousness, which in turn promotes new gender definitions that shape individual’s behavior and reduce gender difference (p. 183). As a result of the continued awareness being placed on gender equality and acknowledgement of women’s rights, new generations of individuals with redefined gender structures are paving the way for individuals who look forward to a world of greater gender equality and the abolishment of discrimination and relegation (Chafetz, 1990).  Thus far, this chapter has outlined the historical and theoretical context of gender dynamics in a broad sense. It is useful to contextualize this in relation to the questions at hand regarding alienation and marginalization in the LGBTQ community. According to MacKinnon (1989), heterosexuality is at the root of gender hierarchies and oppression:  Sexuality […] is a form of power. Gender, as socially constructed, embodies it, not the reverse. Women and men are divided by gender, made into the sexes as we know them, by the social requirements of heterosexuality, which institutionalizes male sexual dominance and female sexual submission. If this is true, sexuality is the linchpin of gender inequality (p. 113). It can be extrapolated from this position that the “social requirements of heterosexuality” are equally responsible for the negative treatment of individuals who deviate from these 74  proscribed norms, in other words, for the LGBTQ community in its entirety. In particular, gender roles become problematic for individuals who find themselves caught between the tensions of a societally prescribed gender identity, such as “female,” and a sexual identity that runs contrary to these societal expectations, such as “lesbian.” The imposition of these labels and gender roles are problematic and restrictive, contributing to the three stressors that Rokach identified as being the primary contributors to the elevated feelings of loneliness and isolation, alienation, and marginalization, experienced by members of the LGBTQ community (MacKinnon 1989).  With the problems presented by rigid gender roles, it is necessary to address these entrenched patterns of inequality. As discussed above, traditional gender roles rely heavily upon a hierarchical power structure that is reliant upon a dominant/submissive dynamic. According to Showden (2012), to break free from this framework:  […] heterosexuality must be dismantled. Heterosexuality creates men as dominators and women as subordinated victims of power; only by eradicating dominant/submissive sexual relations can dominance and subordination in social and political institutions be eliminated (p. 6).  The dissolution of heterosexuality as a template for understanding sexuality is, therefore, a key component for both feminism and queer theory. Judith Butler (2007) notes that, in the past, feminism had arguably contributed to perpetuating a heterosexist view because feminist theory was concerned with dissecting the binaries of male and female. Feminism’s perpetuation of a heterosexist view accounts for much of the opposition between feminist theory and queer theory (Showden, 2012). This opposition may be 75  misplaced, however, when one considers that both queer theorists and feminists are interested in establishing a template where individuals are “unshackled from firm substantive definitions” and are able to “live in opposition to hegemonic norms” (p. 8).  Much of the early sociological and psychological work regarding gender roles and sexuality relied on the notion of social constructionism and the manner in which gender and sexuality are filtered through familial, economic, political, religious, and societal conditions. Within several fields, it is widely acknowledged that “there is no essential ‘sexuality’ with a strictly biological base that is cut off from the social” (Plummer, 2003, p. 516). Foucault, as will be discussed below, emphasizes the social nature of sexuality. Foucault’s History of Sexuality When considering the ways in which the LGBTQ community has developed in relation to sociological and psychological theories, it is worth considering the enormous impact that Michel Foucault’s work has had on this area of research. Foucault, identified as a gay man, and his contributions to discourse around queer theory have made him a powerful model for the LGBTQ community (Spargo, 1999). Foucault’s (1978) The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1 was a groundbreaking work within the field of sociology due to its historical analysis of our preoccupation with sex and gender and how power dynamics affect these views. Foucault stresses that biological sex and desire is shaped and influenced by institutions and discourses, thus creating the phenomenon of sexuality. These institutions shape discourse to maintain the ideals of the hegemon (Foucault, 1978). 76  As a self-styled professor of systems of thought in France, Foucault was trained in philosophy, but emerged, somewhat like Max Weber, with a broad intellectual palette that included areas of study from dreams to sexuality, prisons to philology, ancient Greek thinkers to post-modern playwrights (Spargo, 1999).  Foucault’s (1978) History of Sexuality has shifted the intellectual ground for sexuality studies, and is also a small treatise on power.  In the same way that The Communist Manifesto could be found in the back pocket of a university student in 1968, the History of Sexuality could be found on the average ACT-UP activist in the 1980s (Wolfe, 1994). It calls into question much of what we have thought about in a post-Freudian sexual world and set the stage for the study of queer theory in universities (Spargo,1999) .   A major presupposition of Foucault’s thought is the claim that human beings have a-temporal, content-laden “essence” or “human nature”; rather, their “nature” or “essence” is constituted historically (1978). In some ways, Foucault’s thought is a long elaboration, from French quarters, on Erving Goffman’s hunch, found in his essay “On Face-Work,” that “universal human nature is not a very human thing” (1955, p. 45). Instead of looking at social interactions and the worlds that spring from them as Goffman had, Foucault’s concepts are rooted in continental philosophy, his claims arising from thinkers like Heidegger, who believed the essence of human being lies in its “to be,” and Sartre, who emphasized the ways in which existence precedes essence (Heidegger, 1927; Sartre, 1943). Foucault’s (1978) first expression of this view, later found by himself to be inadequate, comes in his early, somewhat existential-phenomenological writings on dream, art, and madness in which he suggested that an ontological dimension of dreams, 77  poetic imagination, and madness as the “other of reason” haunts all human life. This can be seen in various categories taken up by the arts and philosophy: unreason, disorder, difference, the tragic, strangeness, anxiety, self-transcendence, and (perhaps too much) in freedom. In particular, he saw all of these notions breaking forth in a particularly acute form in mental illness, in thinkers like Nietzsche, in artists like Artaud, figures who worked tragically at the limits of western reason, who experienced the “death of God” and western “man,” and who allowed their imagination to wander, dream-like, in that dark, empty space of the “death of man” (Foucault, 1978). These notions are at the heart of Foucault’s earlier works like Mental Illness and Psychology, Madness and Civilization, and (the end of) The Order of Things (Spargo, 1999). In very profound ways, Foucault’s thought can be characterized as always concerned with the other, limits, transgressions, discourses, and power. By the time he published The Order of Things, his first attempt at a critical review of the then emerging human sciences, and The Archaeology of Knowledge, with its appendix on “The Discourse of Language,” Foucault had established, among other things, a new way of looking at the ways in which knowledge and discourse were tied up with power (Spargo, 1999). Psychology, for example, in Foucault’s view, was a discursive regime and body of knowledge which, as it proceeds along its own rules, has the power to render (not to be confused with the diagnosing function itself) someone “healthy,” “reasonable,” “mentally fit,” and therefore worthy and respectable, while simultaneously rendering other incomprehensible, “sick,” “unreasonable,” “crazy,” or “insane,” and in need of therapy, institutionalization, seclusion, or worse (Foucault, 1978). 78  In the 1980s, looking back on what had been the major “question” of his work, Foucault shared, “my objective…has been to create a history of the different modes by which, in our culture, human beings are made subjects” (Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983, p. 208). He suggested that these “modes” could be schematized in terms of the following three intimately related “modes of objectification” or “axes”: (1) the “knowledge” or “truth axis, in which human beings are objectified on the basis of fields of “knowledge,” the “sciences of man,” or “discursive formations” (e.g., medicine, psychology, psychiatry, linguistics, economics, biology, transcendental philosophies of man in the 19th and 20th centuries, sciences of human sexuality, moral theories); more concretely, (2) the “power axis” where, in interaction with the “truth axis,” social power-relations objectify human beings  by way of normalizing-disciplinary practices and technologies applied to “the body” usually in the context of social or political institutions (e.g., practices and technologies in hospitalized medicine, health care programs, social security systems, mental asylums, prisons, schools, factories, large-scale state management of populations); and perhaps most concretely, (3) the “self” or “ethical axis” where, on the basis of the prevailing “truth” and “power” axes, or in a certain creative “resistance” to them on the basis of “freedom,” individuals turn themselves into ethical subjects, actively constituting themselves, by means of a certain hermeneutical “care of the self,” with its “techniques” or “technologies of the self” and self-formation (e.g., ancient Greek techniques for the aesthetic-ethical formation of “character”; early Christian techniques of asceticism, self-examination, self-deciphering, confession, eradication of desires, and self-renunciations; those in the Reformation emphasis on religious freedom and 79  autonomy; in Kant’s Enlightenment theory and its emphasis on autonomy; in 18th and 19th century sexual practices; in the Romantic genre of Dandyism; and in the 20th century concerns over health care, economic security, longevity of life, and sexual and personal fulfillment; and, finally, the aesthetic-ethical self-fashioning of representatives of local popular knowledges, all of whom are engaged in local “resistance” and strategic struggles against the domination of current systems of what Foucault called power-knowledge, e.g., the ill, social workers, nurses, doctors, sociologists, scientists, philosophers (Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983). In autobiographical passages like the one above, Foucault also suggested that these three modes or axes—knowledge, power, and self-constitution—represented the three major strategic paths or phases regarding the theory of human beings being constituted as “subjects” (Foucault, 1978). There are, then, three axes of the constitution of subjects: knowledge, power, and self. The richness of Foucault’s analyses can be fathomed by comparing George Herbert Mead’s account of the emergence of the self in Mind, Self, and Society (1967), a general social pragmatist way of seeing the self arising with the context of social experience, or Goffman’s empirical snapshot of the mental institution found in his asylums (1955). Mead’s “I” and “me,” for Foucault are historically and discursively produced by systems of knowledge wrapped with various forms of power (Geertz, 1973). Goffman’s portrait of the situation for “inmates” is time-bound and does not capture the ways in which institutions change over time, as a result of new systems of knowledge, and in turn concomitantly shape the emergence of new kinds of human beings. For Foucault, an emphasis on the broad sweeps of history, likely the 80  result of the French school of history prevalent during Foucault’s years, was essential to getting at exactly how human beings are concretely produced historically, as the continental philosophers were asserting, but never demonstrating (1978). There is arguably for Foucault one driving question in his work: how are human beings historically constituted as selves throughout and over time, in the social and political and intellectual contexts in which they find themselves? There is an echo to this question in the anthropological endeavor, summed up by the cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973), who believed, “with Max Weber, that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun” and who took culture “to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning” (1973, p. 5). Foucault refused to believe that philosophy alone, or anthropology alone, or (most certainly) a human science such as psychology, could not be the sole method or strategy for studying the relationship between the three axes of knowledge, power, and the self (Foucault, 1978). Foucault’s methods changed over the course of his career, but there are roughly three corresponding methods or paths to exploring his overarching question: archaeology, genealogy, and ethics (Spargo, 1999). The “knowledge” or “truth” axis was examined in his earlier works leading up to The Archaeology of Knowledge in the 1960s; the “power” axis was explored with his method of “genealogy” in the mid-1970s, in works such as Discipline & Punish and The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1—two works that have had a profound influence on social theory and sociology (Spargo,1999). Foucault focused on the “self” or “ethical axis” in his later works regarding ethics in the 1980s, 81  which include the later volumes of the History of Sexuality and work on self-fashioning and techniques of the self.   This rough periodization only highlights the method Foucault employed to explore the three modes of objectification—knowledge, power, and self—these three axes are operative throughout his work (Spargo, 1999). His lengthy corpus is an attempt, it seems, to rethink the existential categories of Being and Time and Being and Nothingness; to retain these categories in a highly historically analogical and determined mode.  In a sense, Foucault attempts to demonstrate how there are no essences called “freedom” or “care” or “being-in-the world,” etc., but only individual, historically determined forms of freedom, care, etc., and by doing so follows, for sociology, Durkheim’s earlier lead. Anne Warfield Rawls argues that Durkheim’s, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life is, beyond a sociological and anthropological study, a rejoinder to Kant in the area of epistemology (2009). For Kant, the categories of understanding—quantity, universals and particulars, quality, affirmatives and negatives, relation, categorical and disjunctive, space, time, etc.—were hard-wired to some degree (Rawls, 2009). Rawls demonstrates how Durkheim’s “forms” demonstrate the social origins of these categories, which arise as a result of the earliest classifications of sacred and profane and the world spun around them (2009).  Foucault’s work, then, is a concretization of existential categories and the particular forms they take within time, particular institutions, and regimes of truth. Two works from Foucault’s writings are prominent: Discipline & Punishment: The Birth of the Modern Prison and The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1 (Foucault, 1995; 82  Foucault, 1978).  The former takes a broad historical view from the period of a sovereign form of power delineated by juridical theories (1650-1789), works its way through a social mode of power shaped by dominant ideology (1780-1820), and ends with the mode of power Foucault refers to as discipline, which is brought about by a micro-physics of power (Foucault, 1995). This trajectory moves from power being exercised by a king, targeting bodies, employing pain in a ceremonial practice of torture to bring about obedience according to the law (Foucault, 1995). The work continues through a period of various jurists targeting the souls and rights of human beings through forms of theatrical punishment with the intention to restore and shore up community, as discussed by social philosophers (Foucault, 1995). The work ends in the era of criminological experts, targeting the productive and political capacities of human beings, through training and exercise, constant surveillance and examination, to bring about docility (Foucault, 1995). From sovereign torture, through humanist reform, to normalizing detention—a route driven in Foucault’s account by the human sciences—the modern individual is viewed as an object (Foucault, 1995).  The genealogy of the modern individual as a subject is the task of The History of Sexuality (Foucault, 1978). It is virtually impossible to read Foucault’s History of Sexuality and not come away with the notion that sexuality, contrary to those claiming a naturalness to it, is a historical construct, not an underlying biological referent. The text argues that the notion of sex as an archaic drive or underlying essence arose in a particular historical discourse on sexuality, “We have had sexuality since the 18th century, sex since the 19th century. What we had before that was no doubt flesh” (Foucault, 1978, p. 103). During the 18th 83  and especially in the 19th century, sexuality became an object of scientific investigation, administrative control, and social concern, according to Foucault (1978). As a rule, discursive objects (in this case, “sexuality”) only come into being as a result of particular practices (Foucault, 1978). Physicians, reformers, and social scientists came to view sexuality as the key to individual health, pathology, and identity (Foucault, 1978).  Thomas Laqueur’s Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud and Solitary Sex: A Cultural History of Masturbation, are studies entirely shaped by the outlook Foucault lays out in the History, illustrating the ways in which the views of doctors and reformers in various practices shaped notions of sex and sexuality (Laqueur, 2003). Included in his book is a discussion of pamphlets in 18th century France illustrating the purported deleterious effects of masturbation, particularly on health (Laqueur, 2003). At the time, professionals were concerned with the “waste of life” essences or enervating fluids and how they destroyed the lives of those given to the practice of onanism, or masturbation (Laqueur, 2003). Contemporarily, the views of masturbation have changed through various articles extolling the health benefits of masturbation.  Despite differing views on the benefits and harmful effects of masturbation, Foucault viewed sexuality as an instrument and effect in the spread of what he referred to as “bio-power” (1978). Foucault’s thesis is that sexuality was invented as an instrument and effect in the spread of what he calls “bio-power” (Foucault, 1978). Foucault is not exactly quarreling with the boilerplate historical chronology which depicts a turning in the 18th and 19th centuries from a relatively free sexuality which is an undifferentiated 84  part of daily life to one that is controlled and guarded, but he is pointing out that with these controls there came a dramatic, unprecedented rise in discussing, writing, and thinking about sex (1978). Instead of viewing the last several centuries as solely a history of increasing repression of sex and sexuality, he claims there is an increasing channeling of a “regulated and polymorphous incitement to discourse” (Foucault, 1978, p. 34). In contrast to Freud, Foucault does not find much truth, nor the deepest truth, to be one of repression, characterizing the notion as a hypothesis (Foucault, 1978).  Within the discourse of repression, sexuality is thought of as a drive so powerful and so irrational that dramatic forms of individual self-examination and collective control are imperative to keep these forces leashed; in other words, those discourses of repression provide both a diagnosis and a prognosis and plan for treatment (Foucault, 1978). Through the deployment of this notion of sexuality, bio-power spreads its wide net down to the most minute movements and sensations of the body and the slightest excitations of the soul (Foucault, 1978).  For Foucault, a particular practice brought this about—that is, the construction of a specific technology brought the new object into being (1978). This was the confession of the individual subject, either in self-reflection or in speech. While Discipline & Punishment (1995) outlined the evolution of disciplinary technology as a means of controlling the working class and the poor, confession as a technology began with the bourgeoisie. It was in the confession that the body was brought together with various knowledge, discourse, and thereby power was exercised (Foucault, 1978). It is important to note here that sexual identities or sexual liberation movements are not, then, 85  inherently free from or necessarily opposed to domination and power, but may in fact be capitulations to certain forms of power (Foucault, 1978). Foucault’s analysis of social practices in this work are a far-reaching interpretation of modernity in which he is trying to emphasize the importance that sexuality has recently attained in our civilization (Foucault, 1978). According to Foucault, sexuality is not the result of a new-found freedom, instead it is an effect of a new form of power (1978). The repressive hypothesis posits that throughout European history we have moved from a period of relative openness about our bodies and our speech to an ever-increasing repression and hypocrisy relating to our bodies (Foucault, 1978). The 17th century was “a time of direct gestures, shameless discourse, and open transgressions, when anatomies were shown and intermingled at will, and knowing children hung about amid the laughter of adults” (Foucault, 1978, p. 3).  A lively frankness about bodies and sex prevailed. Norbert Elias discusses how free bodies were during this period of history—free to be clothed and naked, to be sleeping close together, even amongst strangers sleeping on hay at inns (2000). Foucault’s civilizing process thesis posits that as the boundaries of the body were shored up over 500 years in European manners and lifestyles, the boundaries of today’s nation-states took shape—the former takes part in the usual story of repression, likely because Elias himself relies somewhat on Freud to construct his theory (Elias, 2000). Philippe Aries’ Centuries of Childhood (1965) depicts young royals sexually engaging their nannies and maids with little to no concern. By the mid-19th century, however, things have—according to the prevailing story—changed for the worse. Laughter was replaced by the “monotonous 86  nights of the Victorian bourgeoisie,” and sexuality was confined to the home, restricted to the parents’ bedroom (a relatively new object in itself for lower classes), and a rule of silence was imposed as censorship of sexuality took hold (Foucault, 1978). Sex became joyless, utilitarian, and geared toward reproduction, was restricted to the bedroom, as there was an exclusion of all acts, speech, and desires that did not conform to a strict, repressive, and hypocritical code (Foucault, 1978). The policed and profitable sex trade on the fringes of Victorian society was the exception to the rule (Foucault, 1978).   According to Foucault, there is an attractive aspect to this repressive hypothesis (1978). The attraction to the hypothesis is its link to the rise of capitalism—that is, we can say that sex is repressed because it interferes with the work ethic demanded by the mode of production which demands all energies be focused on production towards the success of capitalism (Foucault, 1978). Sexuality winds up being an epiphenomenal aspect of the new capitalist order, which is the real story, the real engine of society (Foucault, 1978). Marx and Freud would be proud of this repressive hypothesis, which claims that repression is the general form of domination under capitalism. The appeal of the hypothesis is the speaker’s benefit, if the speaker has chosen to fight in the battle for sexual liberation and against repression (Foucault, 1978).  Since the 19th century, speaking openly and defiantly about sexuality comes to be seen in itself as an attack on repression, and somehow an inherently political act (Foucault, 1978). As a result, when we speak about sex we are denying some established power, offering ourselves the “opportunity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse 87  that combines the fervor or knowledge, the determination to change laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights” (Foucault, 1978, p. 7).  How can we possibly say no to that? Perhaps we have actually succumbed to a different, newer, more subtle form of power, Foucault offers (1978). Beginning in the 18th century, sexuality first emerges as a distinctive discourse, connected to other discourses and practices of power. The administrative concern for the welfare of population triggered a “technical incitement to talk about sex” (Foucault, 1978, p. 23). Still in the shadow of an earlier religious discourse, one which linked the flesh, sin, and Christian morality, a new concern for life resulted in empirical, scientific classifications of sexual activity (Foucault, 1978). Demographers and police, for example, began to explore and track prostitution, population statistics, and how disease were socially distributed (Foucault, 1978). As Foucault says, “sex was not something one simply judged; it was a thing one administered. Sex was in the nature of a public potential; it called for management procedures; it had to be taken charge of by analytic discourses (Foucault, 1978, p. 24). In the 18th century, sex became a “police matter” (Foucault, 1978, p. 24). Concerning what Foucault (1978) called “evil demographers,” administrators, by which Foucault meant government officials, approached the populations as things to be known, controlled, taken care of, and made to flourish. Foucault (1978) explains:  It was necessary to analyze the birthrate, the age of marriage, the legitimate and illegitimate births, the precocity and frequency of sexual relations, the ways of 88  making them sterile or fertile, the effects of unmarried life or of the prohibitions, [and] the impacts of contraceptive practices (p. 101).  The French government began to institute procedures in the sexual life of the population—political and economic concerns made sex an issue which would not involve both the state and the individual (Foucault, 1978). With the shift from matters of population to a recasting of discourse about sexuality into medical terms, primarily throughout bourgeois society, the explosion of discourse on sexuality began in the 19th century (Foucault, 1978). There was a separation between medicine of sex and medicine of the body. ‘Sexual instinct’ was now isolated as an object of study and was viewed as “capable of presenting constitutive anomalies, acquired deviations, infirmities or pathological processes” (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983, p. 117). Whereas sex was previously a family matter, and up to the end of the 18th century, the codes of Western law centered on a particular discourse about sex by means of articulating the religious or legal obligations of marriage together with codes for the transmission of property and the ties of kinship, these codes created statuses, permitted and forbade actions, and constituted a social system (Foucault, 1978).  Marriage and procreation were tied to the exchange and transfer of wealth, property, and power. But eventually, when it comes to the “deployment of sexuality” in the 19th century, sex is cut off from this alliance and becomes an individual matter, concerning hidden private pleasures, dangerous excesses for the body, and secret fantasies (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983). In this way, and through the mediation of doctors, psychiatrists, and others to whom one confesses one’s private thoughts and practices, sexuality becomes seen as the 89  very essence of the individual human being, the core of a personal identity, and it becomes possible to know the secrets of one’s body and mind.  Sex became personalized, medicalized, and rendered significant, dripping with meanings that the new professionals could read and decipher.  Through various scientific breakthroughs, sexuality was now associated with powerful forms of knowledge and a link was established between individuals, groups, cultural meanings, and social control (Dreyfus & Rabinow, 1983). At that time, according to Foucault (1978), four great strategic unities emerged, as power and knowledge combined in specific mechanisms constructed around sexuality which gave rise to a generalized spread of the production and proliferation of discourses on sexuality.  First, there was the hystericalization of women’s bodies, as women’s bodies were seen to be saturated with sexuality and various experiences and behaviors of women were rooted in their sex and sexuality (Foucault, 1978). Second, there was a pedagogization of children’s sex, as children came to be seen as endowed with a sexuality that is natural, according to the psychotherapists, as well as the architects of children’s spaces such as dormitories, and dangerous, according to the administrators and parents (Foucault, 1978). Third, there was the socialization of procreative behavior, which allowed for a state-sponsored degree of racism to enter the picture as various states took upon themselves programs to shape procreation for various groups (Foucault, 1978).  And, finally, there was the psychiatrization of perverse pleasures, inasmuch as sex was constructed as an instinct operating at both the biological and psychic levels, and the sexual instinct and the nature of the individual were intimately connected as sexual science constructed a system of classification of anomalies, perversion, species of 90  deformed sexualities (Foucault, 1978). The chronicling and regulation of individual life was set in place, according to Foucault (1978), and behavior was classified along a scale of normalization and pathologization of the mysterious sexual instinct. Psychiatrists viewed sexuality as penetrating every aspect of a person’s (and especially a pervert’s) life; thus, every aspect of it must be known (Foucault, 1978). Sets of prohibited acts turned into symptoms of a signifying mix of biology and action, while diagnoses were scientifically established and called for corrective technologies, given the good of the individual and all of society was in question now (Foucault, 1978).  Regulation and surveillance of sexuality were now necessary. All of this was made possible by a confessional technology which moved from the domains of religion initially, through political power, and into medicine—this being the genealogy of the confession that Foucault (1978) lays out. The links between confession, truth, and power changed in configuration as an appealing promise to know one’s self, to reveal one’s deepest self, relations of power became so enmeshed that they were difficult to see or break. In its religious origins, the “Christian pastoral prescribed as a fundamental duty the task of passing everything having to do with sex through the endless mill of speech,” wherein the individual is incited to produce a proliferating oration of the state of his soul and the lusts of the body, and the oration is elicited and judged by the priest (Foucault, 1978, p. 21). From its Christian origins, the confession transforms desires of the body and the soul into words, and becomes a general technology (Foucault, 1978). 91  In the 19th century, the individual was persuaded to confess to other authorities—physicians, psychiatrists, and social scientists.  There’s an important distinction to be made between the science of biological reproduction and the science of sexuality, with the latter being tied up in political concerns and practices, with morality creeping in through various forms (Foucault, 1978).  According to Foucault (1978), the science of biology is a used as a cover for the sciences of sexuality, with the latter introducing “micropolitics of power” into the equation (p. 21). Medical discourses of sexuality in the 19th century, for Foucault, link a discourse of truth with practices of power through the object of sex (1978). The location of the confession moved from the religious ritual to the medical examination and the Inquisitor becomes the Interpreter with a range of therapeutic interventions (Foucault, 1978). According to Foucault, this is the underlying technology that brings forth an explosion of discourse about sexuality rather than a repression (Foucault, 1978). Acts once confessed to a priest are now seen as behaviors that are constitutive of individuals; acts become identities.  Foucault’s notion that sexuality is socially constructed and contingent upon those in power (i.e. religious leaders, political leaders, etc.), provides a possible origin of the LGBTQ community and their historical repression (1978). Institutions and those in power shape and influence the discourse to maintain the ideals and values of the hegemon. Foucault’s insights on the power of discourse demonstrates how the LGBTQ community has historically been marginalized for not fitting into the hegemony. 92  Foundations for Alienation and Marginalization Alienation and marginalization are phenomena that have occurred within and across cultures generally with the purpose of protecting cultural boundaries, solidity, tradition, heritage, resources and at times, racial purity. Within groups, marginalization is often used as a punishment for not following cultural rules and expectations. While alienation occurs from within a culture when marginalized persons see evidence that they are being unfairly treated or treated in a fashion that falls outside the culture’s agreed upon rules, “circumstances, conditions, degree, and manner in which the use of force, or actions which might be construed as provocative, may be applied” (Sanremo Rules of Engagement, 2016). Alienation theory has a long history. The term was first used by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and then was taken over by Karl Marx, who used it to describe human’s separation from other humans and from the goods and services they produce (Heathcote, 2009). For Marx and Rousseau, alienation or “estrangement” is the substitution of exchange relations for genuine human connections (Heathcote, 2009). It is of essence to understand the history and theory of alienation and marginalization, to further our understanding of alienation and marginalization of the LGBTQ community.   Human history shows that most, if not all, culture and/or co-cultures have practiced alienation and marginalization as a method to separate out undesirable members, train accepted members in proper decorum and to delineate an individual’s place in the culture or co-culture, whether it is hierarchically arranged or not (Heathcote, 2009). The LGBTQ community currently experiences alienation and marginalization from the dominant mainstream culture due to humans’ proclivity for fear-based, violent 93  or other separatist actions when faced with unfamiliar people. However, due to the reasons why alienation and marginalization occurs within a culture begs the question: does this co-cultural group experience alienation and marginalization in a different fashion, or for different purposes than any other culture or co-culture? In what ways are alienation and marginalization “both the disease and its therapy”? (Heathcote, 2009).   Context and Cultural Contributors to Alienation and Marginalization Hall’s (1976) Beyond Culture became a seminal text in the development of sociology and culture theory. Among the major contributions of this text is a discussion of how co-cultures function within larger cultures, especially how they govern their activities, allow entrance of new members and protect their borders from entrants that could weaken their boundaries. Cultures evolve as a result of the need to find solutions to highly specialized problems, i.e. being transgender in a compulsory cisgender culture, or within either of these, displaying cultural norms violations such as boys wearing colors usually worn by girls or playing with dolls in the cisgender culture (Hall, 1976). The acronym LGBTQ has evolved as the solution to the problem of diversity within the transgender community. Referring to all transgender people as homosexual or gay is a cultural violation within the LGBTQ community because it gives power to oppressive and exclusionary cisgender terminology. Language is power; it can preserve culture, and can be a weapon to build or destroy it. Cultures and co-cultures, especially, have a vested interest in controlling the signs of language. Not doing so results “in powerlessness and lack of self-affirmation that can lead to aggression” (Hall, 1976, p. 7). Hall’s (1976) explains in part the rise of the Queer Nation and of intersex/asexual recognition. The 94  LGBTQ community has claimed power through nomenclature and through establishing gay villages where their members can peaceably reside such as, Midtown in Atlanta, GA; Provincetown in Cape Cod, MA; Greenwich Village in Manhattan, NY; the Castro District in San Francisco, CA, among others. Cultural problem-solving as described here exhibits a paradox—cultural solidarity leads to cultural exclusion or even ghettoization (1976).  Context is another major theoretical consideration in culture formation that also shapes how alienation and marginalization are applied. Culture helps to provide context in our world because it “designates what we pay attention to and what we ignore” (Hall, 1976, p. 85). The screening function that culture performs helps to prevent information overload from the overwhelming volume of information to which we are exposed on a daily basis. Since Hall’s use of this term in 1976, the amount of information exposure has increased exponentially. Consider how this applies to a person in the process of recognizing that they are transgender and not cisgender. These individuals must negotiate a new context and meaning of a co-culture they wish to enter (LGBTQ), and find their own sexual “voice” as each co-culture in the acronym contains mini-co-cultures within it. What type of gay man (straight-acting, butch, top, bottom, transsexual) or lesbian (butch, fem, androgynous, polyamorous, monogamous) or BTQUIA (bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, asexual) will a person become once they have entered their mini-co-cultural group? This dilemma represents the epitome of information overload that if improperly negotiated can lead to alienation and marginalization from the very groups a newly identified LGBTQ person needs to join (Hall, 1976).   95  Generally, coming out and long-term maintenance of a position in the LGBTQ community is traumatic at various point in the process. Trauma can occur or be avoided depending upon how an individual relates to the co-cultural high and low contexts which require learning the underlying structure of the co-culture. The learning process can be disruptive in itself if the learner is faced with increased stimuli and can find no conformity in what is being absorbed. Consider a person who identifies as a lesbian trying to enter the lesbian co-culture, this individual encounters several mini-co-cultures and their respective behavioral expectations, some of which are not acceptable among the mini co-cultural members themselves. An individual will be faced with both high-context and low-context cultures in their acclimation process. High context interactions can be more helpful than low context in helping the individual gain their bearings as a new co-cultural member (Hall, 1976).  It is useful to define “high context” and “low context” in order to understand the interactions within the LGBTQ culture and co-cultures. High context describes co-cultures that have close long-term ties resulting in many of the rules and acceptable behaviors being unspoken.  Family is an example of high context groups (Hall, 1976). The LGBTQ community generally has high context members who will take a new entrant under his/her wing and try to groom them and help them negotiate the new territory. Without high context interaction, most new entrants can become alienated or marginalized and suffer psychological damage as a result.  Low context groups tend to have many connections with other co-cultural members but lack long-term ties (Hall, 1976). Because of their fluidity, acceptable behavior may fluctuate and leave a new 96  entrant feeling confused about how to behave within the context of the group. In low context communities, however, members who can give the new entrant information on acceptable behavior may not be available or may provide incomplete information because they are moving on to other areas of the co-culture resulting in unintended alienation or marginalization. Sullivan (2003), describes it in the clash of politics and feminism with lesbianism in the 1970s. At this point, civil rights politics eclipsed any other considerations for lesbians and did not include a wide variety of lesbian women in the co-culture. As a result, anyone who was not heavily engaged in the academic feminist political movement, e.g. minority women, working class women, “butch/femmes, ‘sex positive’ lesbians, or those whose lesbianism had been shaped by bar culture” were unintentionally but decidedly marginalized (Sullivan, 2003, p. 34). Another common example occurs with LGBTQ youth who, because of their age, especially face unintended marginalization and alienation as they attempt to acclimate into the LGBTQ culture. The P-flag is an example of a high context solution to the low context problem faced by LGBTQ youth. The organization joins youth with stable LGBTQ and cisgender people who can guide them and help them avoid pitfalls such as drugs, depression, suicide and exploitation.  As defined by Hall, culture and context (1976) are strong examples of how applications of alienation and marginalization represent the illness and the cure in the LGBTQ community. The Embrace of and Liberation from Alienation and Marginalization The word “queer” has historically signified difference, separation from homogeneity or otherness, and has become common nomenclature for homosexuals in 97  the early twentieth century (Heathcote, 2009). In the latter part of the twentieth century, a number of marginalized co-cultural groups chose to reclaim language that had heretofore been used against them. This embrace of previously signaled alienation language is an example of co-cultures taking control of what they consider acceptable language usage through “semiology,” a major cultural linguistic theory of Swiss scholar Ferdinand de Saussure, published in 1916 as The Course in General Linguistics. Semiotics explains the mechanism used to shift language from one meaning to another (de Saussure, 2000). Language is a series of signs made of signified—that which the language points to—and signifier—the vocabulary put together to point to something (de Saussure, 2000). A signifier points to the signified, and once a name and meaning has been assigned, it becomes a sign that points to this name/meaning combination. The signifier can be shifted to point to something entirely different than was previously the case because signifiers can be easily attached to many different signified, which is the basis for appropriating language—and therefore assigning the meaning that the culture wants (de Saussure, 2000). We see this occur in slang, for instance. According to de Saussure (2000), there is no natural reason why a signifier and a signified should be linked together; the sign only makes sense when it is related to other signs in the system, such as what occurs when we use the language rules of English or organize the alphabet, creating words that signify signs of various kinds.  This system, whether known or unknown to various co-cultural groups, is precisely how minority groups appropriate hate speech and transform it into empowering speech. The LGBTQ community has performed this language shifting function in many 98  of its co-culture groups, i.e. the use of “queer”, “dyke”, “faggot”, “butch”, “fem” and other such terms which were originally intended to be insults, but are now used to designate and empower particular groups. If de Saussure’s (2000) language theory is deconstructed, then these appropriated names can both serve to heal as well as alienate and marginalize LGBTQ members who in some way fit into the descriptions of what it means to be “queer”, “dyke”, “faggot”, “butch”, or “fem”. Each name creates both a point of inclusion in the mini-co-culture (lesbians, for instance) and a barrier between LGBTQ co-cultural group (if you are a lesbian, you are not a bisexual; if you are transgendered, you might be fully transitioned or in the process of transitioning). The language naturally joins and alienates one group from another. This truth is affirmed when we consider the name shifts engaged in by the LGBTQ community in an effort to create more inclusivity, which presupposes that the previous nomenclature alienated members whom should have been included. For instance, “homosexual” became the signifier for males, leaving out females; thus this term split into two—gay and lesbian.  These two terms, however, leave out bisexuals, who are neither fully gay nor fully straight. After B was added to LG, the need for T to signify the transgender community arose and was added. However, even this stretch for inclusivity was not enough to encompass the notion of queer, a group within the LGBT community that insists upon rejecting previous notions of gender and sexuality. At present, this group constitutes another example of simultaneous and unintended inclusion/alienation/marginalization from within the LGBTQ community (de Saussure, 2000). 99  “The Queer Nation” made its official debut in March 1990 and during the June 1990 New York City Gay Pride March members distributed, “Queers Read This,” a manifesto of rebellion and demand for the same sexual freedom of expression and rights as cisgendered people. Among the demands contained in this manifesto, calls were made for “a moratorium on straight marriage, on babies, on public displays of affection among the opposite sex and media images that promote heterosexuality. Until I can enjoy the same freedom of movement and sexuality, as straights, their privilege must stop and it must be given over to me and my queer sisters and brothers” (“Queers Read This,” 1990). Though the Queer Manifesto purposes to gain rights and rally the LGBTQ community, it can be argued that it also alienates them from each other (those members who do not support this stance versus the new Queer Nation) and it alienates the LGBTQ community from the cisgender community by threatening them. Heathcote (2009) finds that alienation is both inhibiting and emancipatory as “a symptom of the norm and as a means of escape from the norm” (p. 33). Queer Nation attempts to sell itself as an escape route from the norm; it is both “a binary and a dialectic” that “campaigns for both difference and sameness, for an acknowledgement of difference within the same” (Heathcote, 2009, p. 34 – 35). The price for their position is further marginalization occurring within the LGBTQ community and between the LGBTQ and the cisgender community. Queer theory as an academic subject and a part of LGBT studies grew from this movement. On the surface, queer theory and the Queer Nation attempt to tackle the habit of categorization and institutionalization in the LGBT community. However, the two resulted in creating new protected spaces that exclude those who do not agree with their 100  interpretations or manifestations of sexual liberation. Sullivan (2003) argues the purpose of queer theory is to free the LGBT community from the restriction of gender dichotomy and to embrace the freedom from compulsory heterosexuality and its roles, which queer theorists see replicated through the LGBT community. Members of this community want to keep every manifestation of their identity and their sexuality in flux. Yet, even this notion of freedom marginalizes and alienates a number of people in the LGBT community. Queer flux excludes the rights of LGBT members to set up traditional families, which are seen by queers as succumbing to heterosexual hegemony. Straight-acting gays or “lipstick lesbians” are shunned by queers for not fitting in or fully committing to the “LGBTQ co-culture” already marginalized by cisgendered society. Why would an already marginalized group fragment itself by further marginalizing some of its members? Two explanations are provided by Edward T. Hall’s culture theory presented in Beyond Culture (1976) and models of self-actualization, including Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.  Systemic Intolerance and its Influence on the Social Inclusion of LGBTQ Co-cultures In line with Foucault’s theory (1978), it is possible to argue that the social relations that are constructed through the use of discourse give society its particular meaning or disseminate meaning within society. In this way, certain hierarchies are created. These hierarchies dictate who is included and who is excluded from mainstream discourse (Foucault, 1980). The social relations that are laid out and the discourse that underpins these relations are institutionalized through practices that take place in 101  everyday society, in religious institutions, schools, and private homes. This means that there is a permanent reproduction of the practices that may contribute to the exercise of verbal and physical violence towards LGBTQ people. In addition, these practices have the ultimate purpose of enabling the person who is the recipient of the discourse to acquire a “truth”. Foucault (1978) used the example of a person who confesses sexual “sins” to a priest; this confession contributes to the construction of an individual narrative that is interpreted both by the individual, but also frequently by an authoritative figure, in this case, the priest. Spargo (1999) explains, “The ‘truth’ that is revealed in this process is, of course, not found but produced. It exists as knowledge within a particular discourse and is bound up with power” (p. 15). This acquisition of “truth” enables the individual and the authority figure to exercise verbal and physical violence towards people that deviate from the social norms that are deemed to be mainstream.  The same principle and concept of “truth” may be extended to the treatment of certain co-cultures within the broader LGBTQ community (Spargo, 1999). As outlined above, this method of discourse that highlights power-relationships, enables the entrenchment of hegemonic social practices. In other words, there are certain social practices reproduced through discourse that are accepted. The social practices or norms that are not accepted become marginalized from mainstream discourse (Foucault, 1995). In this context, it is possible to say that the knowledge that is created has the potential to be used to exercise power and create the dominance of one group over others.  There is also a process of classification and selectivity that is involved when disseminating the categories that inform the consolidation of social practices. This means 102  that the individuals/or entities in charge of disseminating that knowledge are not only responsible or in charge of selecting what constitutes a normal social practice, but also dictate how this social practice becomes part of the mainstream social power relations (Huffer, 2010).  The process of selecting how knowledge and discourse are configured has been responsible for marginalizing LGBTQ individuals and for preventing their inclusion in mainstream society.  The process of selectivity and classification of meaning and the social practices that are derived from them constitute a form of structural violence further alienating and marginalizing those who identify as LGBTQ because they are not full participants in mainstream society.  This marginalization and alienation is experienced more intensely in countries where the dissemination of discourse is restricted to a reduced number of people at the top of the societal echelon (Huffer, 2010).   In addition to this, structural violence is also entrenched through the process in which public discourse contributes to the appropriation of the bodies of the individual members of society. Within the Foucaultian template, individuals are expected to fulfill a certain role in society. For instance, the body of women is perceived as “docile”, and there is the expectation that women’s bodies will be used for the regeneration and repopulation of society through child-bearing and child-rearing. While the bodies of men are expected to be used in such a way that they contribute to the safety of the nation state, through military service and through conscription (Foucault, 1978). Foucault refers to “biopower” as a way to describe the manner in which social control is exerted through the appropriation of the role of the individual’s body in society (Foucault, 1995). 103  “Biopower” is therefore viewed as a mechanism for disciplining the individual and subjugating him or her within the bounds of certain social practices that are passed down from generation to generation (Foucault, 1995). Through the process of conformity and self-discipline that comes about from the de facto acceptance of the power that the dominant group has over the body of the individual, the process of marginalization and the consolidation of structural violence is accomplished (Foucault, 1980). There is a process of social regulation that emerges from the ownership of the bodies of the individual exercised by the dominant group. In this context, power is exercised through reinforcing or highlighting the view that gender is a static category (Foucault,1980). This view is based on the assumption that the role of men and women in society is to procreate. In this manner, the social reproduction of the species is seen as the ultimate exercise of power by the dominant group. Those that identify as LGBTQ are therefore marginalized because their bodies cannot be owned in the same way as those who abide by the social norms imposed by this exercise of power (Huffer, 2010). Therefore, the lack of subjugation leads to further marginalization and the imposition of structural violence in order to punish those who dare to defy the established order of things. The bodies of LGBTQ individuals are not submissive in relation to the dominant group because they are not subject to the same process of disciplining and regulation that is expected of heterosexuals (Huffer, 2010).  It is worth applying Foucault’s notion of “biopower” to the co-cultures that exist within the LGBTQ community. When the labels of “queer”, “dyke”, “faggot”, “butch”, or “fem” are applied to individuals, they carry expectations regarding what these 104  individuals should do with their bodies. In this sense, the use of labels for co-cultures is inherently related to structural violence, because it perpetuates certain concepts of the body and how those bodies will be used (Shefer, 2001). According to Shefer (2001):   Central to the construction of gendered subjectivity is the body, as a vehicle for the inscription of masculinity and femininity. Postmodern theorists caution against the view of the body as a passive vehicle, but acknowledge the body-subject as both subjected to and active in resisting discourse. Significant in this respect are the different inscriptions on the male and female body, which are particularly evident and visual in contemporary globalized capitalism with its powerful consumerist culture (p. 39).  Although Shefer (2001), is particularly focusing on gender in reference to male and female bodies, the ways in which the body-subject participates within and resists discourse is relevant to a broader discussion of sexual identities as they are manifested within LGBTQ communities. Consider the ways in which sexual identities and the labels associated with these identities may also carry elements of status. Are all identities within the LGBTQ culture considered by that culture to be equal, or do certain labels and identities confer different levels of status and prestige? This is a question that merits further exploration and analysis. More broadly, this process of subjugation of the bodies of LGBTQ individuals is due to a discourse that tends to be skeptical, at the very least, about the possibility that they may be able to partake in the same benefits granted to majoritarian groups within society, such as the right to have children, the right get married, the right to adopt children, and other benefits (Shefer, 2001).  105  Another aspect that is brought forth in Foucault’s work is the idea that the individual partakes in the process of entrenching these social norms (1978). In other words, there is a process of subjugation that comes from the bottom up. From this standpoint, LGBTQ individuals could participate in further entrenching their marginalized position within society by buying into the discourse that regards their lifestyles as fundamentally different from that of heterosexual people (Huffer, 2010). In the dissemination of discourse that entrenches exclusionary social practices, there is the propagation of structural violence as a result of the impossibility or difficulty that emerges from being able to break free from the social practices exhibited in society (Huffer, 2010).  Tolerance becomes another factor that solidifies structural violence towards minority groups such as LGBTQ individuals. In his study of intercultural relations, Galtung differentiates between different forms of intolerance, or violence (1967). The first, refers to a form of intolerance that occurs between different groups and comes about through the exercise of manifest, direct violence. The second is a kind of passive tolerance that entails the granting of rights to minority groups but precludes the possibility of assiduous contact between groups (Galtung, 1967). Galtung also highlights the existence of an active form of interculturalism, in which the different groups have a distinct desire to get to know each other. Finally, there is a facet that transcends all of the above; this facet is based on the idea of mutual dialogue and mutual learning between the members of different groups (Confortini, 2006).  According to Confortini (2006), “Galtung conceives of peace as both negative (absence of direct violence) and positive 106  (presence of social justice). Only the elimination of violence at all levels can lead to true peace (negative as well as positive)” (p. 335). It is in the pursuit of this notion of peace that an understanding of structural violence and its effect on the LGBTQ community is necessary and useful. In the first two definitions/views of tolerance, the idea of acceptance, or egalitarianism, is informed by the systemic bias towards the majority group and its norms (Confortini, 2006). In other words, although minority groups such as LGBTQ people are accepted and granted equal rights, the discourse that is disseminated has a very narrow view of tolerance and still propagates the idea of minority groups as fundamentally different (Confortini, 2006). The current state of affairs in the Western world regarding the position of LGBTQ individuals in society is therefore guided by the increased tolerance towards this minority group, and at the same time, the perpetuation of exclusionary practices as they appear in the spectrum of social discourse (Confortini, 2006). Therefore, it may be argued that there is an important element of structural violence that permeates through society at large, in spite of the dissemination of equal rights and opportunities for LGBTQ people (Bobichand, 2012).  Tolerance as a Reinforcement of Alienation and Marginalization Tolerance is defined as a recognition of a minority group that does not extend to inclusion (Freire, 2005). Despite its typically positive connotation, one may deduce tolerance is not enough. Brazilian philosopher and educator, Paulo Freire (2005), explains, “On an initial level, tolerance may almost seem to be a favor, as if being tolerant were a courteous, thoughtful way of accepting, of tolerating, the not-quite-107  desired presence of one opposite, a civilized way of permitting a coexistence that might seem repugnant” (p. 42). Freire recognizes the pitfall of tolerance—the emphasis on “the other”.  Tolerance is best understood when viewing such behavior through a behaviorist lens. B.F. Skinner, better known as the father of Behaviorism, was known for his contributions to psychology, particularly the study of behaviors, rather than mental processes (Skinner, 1972). As outlined in his Theory of Operant Conditioning Skinner suggests that behavior can be changed through reinforcement that occurs when a desired response results from a given stimuli. Within a behaviorist framework, there are three possible types of operants or responses that can transpire after a certain behavior: neutral operants, reinforcers, and punishers (Skinner, 1972). Neutral operants are responses that have no effect on the probability that a behavior will be repeated. Reinforcers are responses that increase the probability that a behavior will be repeated, while punishers are responses that cause the probability of repetition to decrease. Employing a behaviorist lens, consider the role that tolerance of a minority group plays in relation to the mainstream culture. The response that tolerance, as it has previously been defined, is likely to elicit is one in which the mainstream dominant culture’s behavior is consistently reinforced, rather than punished (Skinner, 1972). The reinforcement may occur in a number of areas. On a surface level, tolerance gives the appearance of goodwill and inclusion; it appears to indicate openness and acceptance. Those groups and individuals who demonstrate tolerance are therefore rewarded with moral and ethical accolades. Another reward is far less obvious. By demonstrating tolerance, the minority group is 108  acknowledged but is maintained at arm’s length. The dominant culture preserves its own perceived integrity and is not forced to view the minority group as being equal. This is a reinforcing reward in the sense that the status quo, which invariably benefits the dominant culture, is consistently reinforced, rather than threatened (Skinner, 1972). To a lesser degree, Skinner’s theory of Behaviorism can also be applied to the perpetuation of sub-cultures within the LGBTQ culture itself. If an individual identifies as “queer”, “dyke”, “fem”, “butch”, or any of the other extant categories, this leads to a rewarding sense of belonging and potentially higher levels of acceptance and social support within those respective sub-cultures, while creating a separation amongst others that identify within another sub-culture in the community. To discard labels, however, generally brings a punishing response, as the individual may find themselves socially isolated or criticized for not choosing a specific group or mold (Seidman, 1997).  Despite the positive effort that tolerance entails the emphasis on difference simply becomes problematic. Lesbian poet and Civil Rights Activist, Audre Lorde (1983), explained, “Advocating the mere tolerance of difference. . . is the grossest reformism. Difference must be not merely tolerated, but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our creativity can spark like a dialectic. Only then does the necessity for interdependence become unthreatening” (p. 95). Gaps Within the Literature There are currently several gaps within the current literature as it relates to the marginalization and alienation within the LGBTQ community. One of the main gaps is the limited research that exists with the term integration and the LGBTQ community as 109  related to identity and gender. Most of the current literature focuses on the term tolerance and its impact on the LGBTQ community. Based on the research conducted, there is not much scholarly work recommending the inclusion of the word tolerance instead of integration as it relates to the LGBTQ community.  Additionally, another gap found in the literature is the lack of conflict resolution theories that are specifically applicable to the unique needs of the LGBTQ community. Although there are theories that provide a detailed analysis for conflict resolution, they primarily provide an in depth analysis of the factors that contribute to the conflict rather than actionable steps toward the resolution.   110  Chapter 3: Methodology Although a quantitative study can be implemented for this dissertation, the research method employed for this study was content analysis. This study aimed to analyze the applicability of structural violence, social cubism, and human needs theories, as conflict resolution theories to the LGBTQ community. Drawing upon existing academic literature, a content analysis approach was most conducive to this study. Content analysis constitutes a viable methodological approach in order to broach the aspects related to questions of integration and tolerance within the LGBTQ community as well as the applicability of theories for a particular population, which are the basis of this study. Content analysis is centered on the examination of the communication and semantic aspects incorporated in the narrative that originates from written text. This qualitative method operates by identifying the different themes that emerge from the examination of the literature. These themes enable us to ascertain the tacit and/or explicit meaning that is contained in the text (Yin, 2013). This study followed a case study research design. Methodology: Case Study Yin (2013) defined case study as “an empirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon in depth and within its real-life context, especially when the boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident (p. 16). Considering the focus of this study, it is important to consider “how” and “why” factors such as identity and gender impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community and if the conflict resolution models mentioned above are applicable to the LGBTQ community. 111  Further, this method allowed for understanding “complex social phenomena,” in particular, the marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community and how such alienation has resulted in a community in need of a conflict resolution approach that promotes integration versus tolerance (Yin, 2013).  Case Study Research Design According to Yin (2013), when conducting case study research design, there are five components: the case study questions, the propositions, if any, its unit (s) of analysis, the logic linking the data to the propositions, and the criteria for interpreting the findings (p. 29). The research questions for this study allowed the researcher to focus on the unit of the analysis for the study.  At the core of the case study research design is exploring the “how” and “why” of a particular individual, organization, community, and/or phenomenon (2013). As was stated earlier, the research questions for this study were: 1. How and why do factors such as gender and identity impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community? 2. How and why are structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theories applicable to the LGBTQ community as conflict resolution theories? The second component of the research design is the study propositions. The study propositions allow the researcher to emphasize attention to a particular focus that should be examined within the study.  The proposition for this study was why factors such as identity and gender impact integration in the LGBTQ community, as well as how are current conflict resolution theories being researched in this study applicable to the 112  LGBTQ community? The “how” and why” questions placed an additional emphasis on the study being conducted and allow the reader to better understand the study as a whole (Yin, 2013). Throughout this paper, these factors were analyzed in depth. For this study, the unit of the analysis was the LGBTQ community. According to Yin (2013), when implementing case study research design, one must separate the individuals that are in the group from those that are outside of it. Although marginalization and alienation have been prevalent in many other communities, for the purpose of this study, the LGBTQ community was the focus of this study. An extensive review of the literature revealed how throughout time, this community has been plagued by intolerance, pressured to conform to societal standards, and marginalization. When developing the criteria for identifying a case study’s findings, the researcher must identify and address rival explanations for the findings. In doing so, rival explanations are explored, addressed, and possibly rejected, making the findings more prevalent. Such analysis will also determine what future topic(s) should be conducted and/or researched further (Yin, 2013). Rival explanations are further explained in step four of the analyzing the evidence section.    Type of Case Study Used Though Yin (2013), proposes a multiple case approach or a single case approach when conducting a case study, the single case approach is most relevant for this study due to the common case rationale. Yin (2013) explains that the purpose of a common case is to “capture the circumstances and conditions of an everyday situation” to obtain information about the “social processes related to some theoretical interest” (p. 52). As 113  such, this study examined the applicability of three conflict resolution theories: structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to the LGBTQ community as well as explored how factors such as identity and gender impact a sense of integration. As a result, information that explains the social process of marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community and strategies that better address this phenomenon were revealed.  As mentioned earlier, the unit of analysis for this study was the LGBTQ community. Potential single-case designs are holistic or embedded, and when selecting between a holistic or embedded case study design, the most proper form of design for this study was the holistic design. According to Yin (2013), “if the case study examines only the global nature of an organization or program, a holistic design would be used” (p. 55). For this study, a holistic approach was more relevant as a holistic analysis of the marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community was conducted and the selected conflict resolution theories (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, structural violence and social cubism) were analyzed for their applicability to this community. This approach is more conducive since the LGBTQ community was being studied as a whole—and not as subgroups of the larger community. An embedded approach would need to address and analyze the subunits that exist within this community and how/if the theories are applicable to the subunits within the community. Further research on the subunits of the LGBTQ community can be conducted based on the results of this study. Another rationale for employing a holistic case study design is that the conflict resolution theories analyzed as part of this study were of a holistic nature.  114  Yin (2013) discusses several weaknesses when implementing a holistic design. One of the weaknesses is the possibility of the study having been too broad, thus not allowing the researcher to have defined or clear data to analyze. To avoid lack of specificity, the study detailed research questions that guided and maintained the clarity and analysis of data. Another weakness Yin (2013) highlights in holistic design is the possibility of the core of the study changing as a result of research or analysis being conducted. In doing so, the initial research questions the researcher had chosen, may shift based on new information gained as a result of the study. Before selecting the research questions, the topics were thoroughly researched for several months. Being cognizant of how my perception may change as a result of the research being conducted and new information being studied, helped me not lose orientation of the focus of my study.  Data Collection When conducting a case study, Yin (2013) recommends using a variety of sources including “documentation, archival records, interviews, direct observations, participant-observation, and physical artifacts” (p. 103). For this study, no participants were interviewed, rather the bulk of sources used in this study were journal articles, books and electronic sources on theories relevant to the units of the study as well as intrapersonal factors such as gender and identity. To better understand the experiences of the LGBTQ community, works of seminal theorists in identity and gender formation were examined including Butler, Sedgwick, and Foucault, among others.  A detailed explanation of how the LGBTQ community has been marginalized and alienated throughout history is delineated.  Moreover, how such alienation and 115  marginalization has left a community in need of a model that is applicable and suitable for the struggles it has faced and continues to deal with. As such, a holistic and unbiased perspective of factors that can and have prevented this community from addressing intrapersonal as well as interpersonal conflicts is addressed. In doing so, the three theories which have been used to address and/or explain conflict are Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, social cubism and structural violence were analyzed to determine their applicability to the LGBTQ community.  Based on the amount of articles, electronic sources and books that were researched as part of the data collected of this study, it was crucial for the researcher to develop a set of criteria to determine what data was used to analyze the results of the research collected. According to Yin (2013), a detailed and structured criteria for data collection is critical for the research design of a study. For the purpose of this study, the researcher used 20 articles that focused on the LGBTQ community as a whole and not its subgroups. Additionally, the articles that were used to analyze the data were articles that included incidents involving and information related to the LGBTQ community in the United States alone. For the research data related to theorists and theories, criteria included using primary sources and additional works by original scholars. Regarding the criteria for the content of the study, articles, books and electronic resources occurring after the Stonewall Riots were the sources that were analyzed and interpreted for the results of this study. This criteria was decided based on the organic demarcation that Stonewall represents for the LGBTQ community. When conducting research for this 116  study, most, if not all of the scholarly work as it relates to the LGBTQ community emerged post the Stonewall Riots.  To reduce the occurrence of bias, Yin (2013) recommends “triangulation”, or collecting data from various sources to determine the consistency of findings (Yin, 2013, p. 119). To increase consistency, a variety of sources were used and cross referenced to ensure accuracy of the literature collected. Having grown up in a community that is very much inclusive of the LGBTQ community, and with my younger brother identifying as gay, avoiding personal biases and preconceptions was of particular importance to me. In particular, I tried to analyze the chosen conflict resolution models without any preconceived notions about their applicability or lack thereof. I informed my analysis based on the theories of identity and gender formation and how these factors, in particular, are experienced by and affect the LGBTQ community. To further prevent bias, the researcher maintained a journal throughout the process of data collection and reviewed it on a weekly basis to identify and process any feelings or thoughts of bias or discomfort as it relates to the data being collected.  Analyzing the Evidence Yin (2013) recommends four strategies while analyzing case study evidence: the first is to follow the original theoretical propositions that led to the formation of the case study; the second is to “play with the data” or notice patterns; the third is to develop a case description, or descriptive framework to organize the data; and the fourth is to examine “plausible rival explanations” (p. 136-140). Following these four strategies ensures that the researcher analyze an adequate amount of data including data that may 117  conflict with the researcher’s original theoretical propositions. During the collection phase, the researcher may have developed certain sub-questions based on the study conducted and the thorough review of the literature. However, as the evidence is interpreted and analyzed, the researcher will gain an additional understanding of the overall topic and directly address the research questions of the study (Yin, 2013). Sources outlined for the sake of this study include sources that discuss the development of identity, the role of gender as it relates to alienation and marginalization and its effect on the integration of the LGBTQ community, the importance of members of the LGBTQ community to be integrated rather than tolerated, the barriers that individuals from the LGBTQ community experience, and information on the selected conflict resolution models to address their applicability to the LGBTQ community. My theoretical proposition was that factors such as identity and gender have a direct effect on integration in the LGBTQ community. As data was collected and analyzed, the concern was to see how these factors impacted a sense or lack of integration in the LGBTQ community and how these factors lead to interpersonal conflict within these individuals. The second proposition was that there is indeed a need for an applicable conflict resolution model to be used with the LGBTQ community.  Following Yin’s (2013) strategies to analyzing data, he recommends finding relationships or patterns within the data. Through the analysis of the data, the following patterns emerged: the LGBTQ community demonstrated resilience, a desire to be integrated and be treated equally, a community whose identity was shaped by social constructs that mandated how they ought to behave, act and feel. Despite the 118  community’s resilience and self-advocacy, patterns of despair, turmoil, anger, and marginalization due to the expression of an individual’s authentic identity remain prevalent. These patterns are evident in the historical accounts of Harry Hay and the works of Judith Butler, and Eve Sedgwick, among others.  As stated earlier, quantitative data was not used for this case study. While quantitative data may have provided insight into the research questions, it does not have the power to demonstrate “how” and “why” the LGBTQ community is marginalized and alienated. Furthermore, it does not provide the reader with the same level of detail and the extent to which the three theories chosen for this study, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, structural violence and social cubism are applicable to the LGBTQ community. A quantitative study would have provided the reader an overview of the numbers of LGBTQ individuals whom have been marginalized and alienated, but not specific instances nor explanations which showcase the examples of such marginalization and alienation. Additionally, this study offers a detailed explanation of how identity and gender have had a direct effect on integration or lack thereof on the LGBTQ community. As a result, after thorough consideration of both measures, a qualitative study was conducted for this dissertation.  The third step, according to Yin (2013), involves organizing the case study into a descriptive framework. While gathering and analyzing data, it is important for the researcher to maintain the topic and the research questions in mind. When collecting data, I completed a detailed search on the factors of identity and gender and their relation to the LGBTQ community. The more I researched these two factors, I noticed that most of the 119  literature I found did not focus on integration, instead there was an emphasis on “tolerance”. As I continued reading the articles on identity and gender, more recommended readings led me to research marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community. The literature revealed how such marginalization and alienation left the LGBTQ community in need of belonging and/or feeling accepted/integrated to mainstream society. As a result of these readings, I realized that the community needed more than being tolerated; they needed a sense of integration into a society that had shunned them. The more research and analysis of the readings I conducted, the more I was able to formulate a descriptive framework for my study. Once I was aware that factors such as gender and identity impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community, my next step was to find out “how” these factors impacted the LGBTQ community. As a result of continued research and analysis, I selected three conflict resolution theories: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, structural violence, and social cubism, to test their applicability as conflict resolution approaches and explanatory frameworks of conflict for the LGBTQ community. According to Yin (2013), the fourth and final step involved in analyzing data is to examine plausible rival explanations. My first research question is concerned with how factors such as gender and identity impact integration. However, in my analysis of relevant literature, I noted that other factors such as race and religion also impact one’s sense of integration in a group. However, these factors are not the ones being researched in this study. Another rival explanation is that a conflict resolution strategy is not needed specifically for the LGBTQ community, as the community has celebrated various 120  advancements in the social and political spheres in the past few years. Increased representation in social mediums such as in the entertainment field, in religious organizations, as well as in places of employment have led to the perception of a more inclusive society. Despite these various advancements, those that identify as LGBTQ remain hopeful that there will come a time when they are seen as truly equal and integrated into mainstream society.  Yin (2013) presents five analytic techniques, but the technique most relevant for this study is “explanation building,” in which “the goal is to analyze case study data by building an explanation about the case” based on the “how” and “why” of the particular phenomenon (p. 147). More importantly, the purpose of this dissertation was not only to find conclusions, but to reveal areas for further study. Due to the complexity of the research questions, particularly the second question regarding the applicability of structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, as conflict resolution theories for the LGBTQ community, my hope is that this study can lead to the creation of new theories or frameworks, addressing conflict resolution, that will benefit the LGBTQ community at large.  121  Chapter 4: Analysis After careful examination of the literature review for this study, which included the history of the LGBTQ movement, identity formation, societal expectations based on identity and gender, and the systems in place that perpetuate alienation and marginalization in the community, the following themes emerged: a community that demanded to be integrated and be treated equally, a community whose identity was shaped by social constructs that mandated how they ought to behave, act and feel, a community that although was resilient and self-advocated, was in despair and turmoil. Moreover, patterns of anger, apathy and a need for individual’s true identity to be validated emerged. This was evident by the many riots, political campaigns, marginalization and alienation of the community, as well as need to “hide” their true selves for safety. Those that chose not to hide their true self, as indicated earlier, faced consequences of exclusion, discrimination and dehumanization. In this chapter, the selected conflict resolution theories, structural violence, social cubism, and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, will be analyzed to offer an in-depth explanation of their relevance and possible application to the LGBTQ community. As was mentioned earlier, no interviews were conducted for this study. Rather, the themes that emerged from the literature set the basis for measuring the applicability of the selected conflict resolution theories to the LGBTQ community. Gender, Identity, and Integration Tolerance has been previously defined as a recognition of a minority group that does not extend to inclusion. While tolerance appears to be a positive response to the 122  LGBTQ community from the cisgender community, tolerance may indeed provide more benefits to the cisgender community than to those that identify as LGBTQ. On the outset, tolerance appears to be a positive sentiment towards another human being or a group; however, the other human being or group is still acknowledged as an“other”—the dominant group maintains their position as the majority and does not necessarily view the tolerated group as an equal. Further, the dominant group is actually lauded for their expression of “tolerance” (Hall, 1976). Based on the analysis of the research conducted for this study, the majority of the literature surrounding factors such as identity and gender emphasize “tolerance” as the appropriate response towards the LGBTQ community. The word integration although not the main focus of the literature, is a more embracive-inclusionary approach to addressing issues of marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community. When addressing gender and identity, the way in one expresses such identity and their gender directly relates to the level of marginalization and alienation they experience. At times, the act itself of homosexuality is not what “the other” rejects, but the visual representation of not abiding the norms established by society. As a result, individuals who “fit” such standards are prone to “pass” and be integrated more easily than one that expresses their true self “breaking” such social constructs created to restrict their identity expression (Butler, 1997). Although as a collective, the LGBTQ community has experienced levels of marginalization and alienation, the severity of the extent of such experiences vary from individual to individual and how one expresses themselves (Hall, 1976). 123  Analysis of Galtung’s Structural violence Johan Galtung’s Structural violence theory states that violence is institutionalized in the social structure of a system to prevent certain individuals from moving forward and advancing accordingly. Institutionalized discrimination, neglect, misrepresentation, violence, and/or oppression targeted toward certain groups that would result in the loss of or hinder the possibility of the human condition are considered examples of structural violence (Galtung, 1969). Structural violence is not necessarily targeted to one particular individual, but toward groups who share the same ethnic background, religion, sex, or ideology. This, in turn, separates structural violence from other theories that focus on the self rather than the collective (Galtung, 1969).   When analyzing the marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community from a structural violence perspective, it is clear how those in power, the cisgender majority, have intentionally created a system which perpetuates the inequality and the inability for individuals outside of the mainstream gender community to advance. As demonstrated in the Stonewall Riots, individuals within the LGBTQ community felt compelled to challenge the systems in place that marginalized and alienated their community. Systemic oppression, including the justice system, promoted anti-gay sentiment and intolerance of the LGBTQ community. A series of incidents between LGBTQ community members and local law enforcement led to a shift within the LGBTQ community, where the community felt the need to self-advocate and take a stand (Wolfe, 1994). Viewing this example through a structural violence lens, it is important to understand that in this phenomenon it is not only about physical violence exerted toward 124  a particular individual or group of individuals, but a system that intentionally promotes exclusion. This system, including the justice system, creates the conditions for individuals of a particular group (usually a minority) to be hindered from succeeding or advancing (Wolfe, 1994).  When analyzing this theory from an identity and gender perspective, if one’s identity is expressed in a way that is not aligned with societal norms established by those in power, then the system will further marginalize or alienate the individual because of that identity. As mentioned earlier in this study, such alienation and marginalization has been demonstrated in riots against the LGBTQ community and those expressing gender nonconformity, and the preclusion of basic human rights. This has been showcased by imposing power and control toward a community and/or behavior that is not up to par with what society identifies as being normal or worthy. As a result, individuals have had to repress their authentic identities (creating intrapersonal conflict) or have resorted to violence (creating interpersonal conflicts) (Huffer, 2010).  The chart below applies the principles of Galtung’s (1969) theory on Structural violence to the LGBTQ community: 125  Table 1 Application of Structural Violence to the Marginalization and Alienation of the LGBTQ Community Theory Application Inequalities in systematic social systems lead to violence (Galtung, 1969).  As demonstrated in the Stonewall Riots, individuals within the LGBTQ community felt compelled to challenge the systems in place such as harsh policing, that marginalized and alienated their community (Wolfe, 1994). Such violence led to acts of rebellion and self-advocacy.   Institutionalized discrimination, neglect, misrepresentation, violence, and/or oppression targeted toward certain groups that would result in the loss of or hinder the possibility of the human condition are considered examples of structural violence (Galtung, 1969). President Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States of America, led several efforts to support the LGBTQ community including the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” (CNN Library, 2017), same-sex domestic partnership insurance coverage (Office of the Press Secretary, 2016), and the United States Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States (It Gets Better Project, 2016). Such examples highlight the systemic violence and marginalization of a community that did not and still does not fully benefit from the same resources as the cisgender community.  When considering the ways in which alienation and marginalization occur within the LGBTQ community, it is useful to consider a broader context of structural violence and systemic intolerance, particularly in reference to the work of Michel Foucault. One of the ways in which structural violence appears in the societal spectrum relates to the way in which the public discourse is aligned and configured in mainstream society. Foucault argued that discourse has a profound influence on the way in which power relations are constructed (Foucault, 1980). The articulation of discourse strategy in mainstream society is meant to provide a modicum of stability in regard to the way that social relations are constructed. Foucault argues that discourse creates a certain type of social knowledge, a 126  knowledge that is ultimately responsible for creating the role that each individual occupies in society. Discourse is therefore an ideational construct that is disseminated by those who are in charge of the instruments or means of communication in society at large (Foucault, 1995). The entities or people who have control over the means of communication are in virtual charge of what it is that can be thought and spoken. More importantly, they have control over who is allowed to think and speak—essentially, what voices are heard and considered valid (1995). This has significant repercussions for the expression of heteronormative discourse in mainstream society and the relegation of LGBTQ individuals to a minority, a minority that does not represent the views of mainstream society, and is therefore communicatively silenced.  Tolerance can be another factor that contributes to structural violence toward LGBTQ groups, as its main purpose seems to be the imposition of certain categorizations that actually determine what social practices are acceptable, and which are not acceptable. Tolerance means the imposition of boundaries between what appears to be normal and what is not. Tolerance implies that the majority group recognizes the minority group, but not necessarily its inclusion into the main spectrum of society (Galtung, 1967). The degree and content of the spectrum of tolerance is determined by the specific way in which social discourse is articulated. As we can see, public discourse can have enormous repercussions for the creation of instruments of power that perpetually marginalize LGBTQ individuals, or that create a situation in which their inclusion is kept within certain proscribed boundaries (Francis, 2004). These boundaries do not go in any way against the process of self-regulation that is imposed by the creation of knowledge that is 127  aimed at determining accepted social practices and which social practices are not acceptable. These are factors that are of paramount importance in terms of understanding and appreciating the levels of social inclusion and exclusion that exist in regards to the LGBTQ community. It is also useful for understanding the difficulties that reside in attempting to reconfigure the discourse that prevails in Western societies, especially as this discourse regards the articulation of norms that regulate relations between majority and minority groups (2004).  It is then difficult, if not impossible to consider Structural violence as an applicable theory to the LGBTQ community when those that are creating laws, policies and rules are primarily those outside of the marginalized community. This study has demonstrated how the LGBTQ community has been systematically mistreated and ostracized through time demonstrating the need for action to be taken against those creating laws that further marginalize this community. Structural violence can be used to explain how alienation and marginalization are perpetuated in the LGBTQ community. While this theory can be used to inform the origins and sustainment of the aforementioned alienation and marginalization, it cannot be used to resolve the systemic conflict. Its utility is explanatory at the systemic level and therefore provides a detailed and specific analysis of the conflict.  128  Analysis of Byrne & Carter’s Social cubism Unlike other conflict resolution models, Sean Byrne and Neil Carter’s social cubism invites professionals to view an issue from various perspectives. The model includes six factors which are interdependent: demographics, politics, economics, history, religion, and psycho-natural factors. Understanding the interrelation of these six factors is necessary to understand the root/cause of the conflict to find ways to resolve it. Under this ideology, all six factors work in relation to one another to produce patterns of behavior (Byrne & Carter, 1996). In implementing social cubism to conflict and conducting a six factor analysis, the conflict resolution professional is able to realize not one individual factor is the underlying cause to a problem, but a combination of several driving factors and how they function as a whole. Being mindful of such interdependence and overlap leads to its resolution and analysis (Byrne & Carter, 1996).  Although this analytical approach was originally designed to explain the incidence of ethno territorial conflict, social cubism could potentially be used as an explanatory framework for conflict in matters pertaining to violence perpetrated against the LGBTQ community for it will provide a holistic multi-dimensional overview of the conflict being analyzed. social cubism could also be used as an analytical framework that would allow professionals to elucidate certain aspects related to the marginalization and alienation felt by members of the LGBTQ community (Byrne & Carter, 1996). This theoretical perspective is useful to appraise certain aspects pertaining to the marginalization and alienation of the LGBTQ community. Additionally, it provides one with an elaborate picture of the different elements pertaining to marginalization and alienation directed 129  toward the LGBTQ community. The table below highlights relevant examples of alienation and marginalization using the six-sided cube model: Table 2 Application of Social cubism to the Marginalization and Alienation of LGBTQ Community Sides of Cube Examples of Application Historical Factors Throughout time, members of the LGBTQ community have been marginalized, alienated, mistreated and restricted of their basic human rights. Individuals from this community have been killed and rejected from society for their sexual orientation such as in the Stonewall Riots (Altman, 2001). However, there have been instances in which those in the LGBTQ community have rallied for and demanded their rights, such as with the publication of the Queers Read This manifesto in 1990 and the formation of organizations like “Queer Nation” and “The Lesbian Avengers” (Wolfe, 1994).  Religious Factors Many religions condemn homosexuality as it is considered a sin and an act of evil. Individuals with religious beliefs repress their true self in fear of being shunned from their religious institution. Religion has also been used to justify such marginalization and alienation toward the LGBTQ community (Adamczyk & Pitt, 2009). Psychocultural Factors The rainbow flag is a symbol created for the LGBTQ community to express their identity in solidarity. Pride parades and marches promoting equal rights provide a sense of family, unity and shared beliefs for a community that was experiencing marginalization and alienation (Armstrong & Crage, 2006).  Political Factors  Laws and policies created and enforced to further marginalize and alienate the LGBTQ community thus forcing the community from expressing and being their true selves. The Human Rights Campaign noted a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills in 2015 ranging from “nullifying local civil rights protections” to “anti-transgender” bills (Human Rights Campaign, 2015). Demographic Factors The state in which an individual lives can further perpetuate the marginalization and alienation of LGBTQ individuals. More progressive states provide a more safe and non-threatening environment than others. In a report conducted by the Human Rights Campaign (2015), it was revealed that some states still promote conversion therapy and that even in more progressive states like Massachusetts, anti-LGBTQ bills are still introduced (“Wave of Anti-LGBT Bills in 2015 State Legislative Sessions”, 2015).   Economics Several states have laws in existence where an employer can terminate, alienate, and marginalize an individual for identifying as LGBTQ. As of 2016, The Human Rights Campaign found that only five states had laws that “prohibit discrimination against public employees based on sexual orientation only” (“Statewide Employment Laws & Policies”, 2016). 130  Social cubism is a framework that examines the conditions in which conflict arises, the factors that enable its development over time, and the possible resolutions. Social cubism constitutes a useful platform to understand the different aspects related to the conflict experienced by minority groups, including the LGBTQ community.  Analysis of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs When considering the mechanisms of alienation and marginalization within the LGBTQ community, it is worth considering the question of self-actualization, or reaching one’s potential, and the various models that address this process. Abraham Maslow, the father of humanistic psychology, is known for his 1943 paper, A Theory of Human Motivation, in which he introduced the hierarchy of needs, a pyramid structure that contains five levels of human needs. All human beings regardless of their demographic, have essential needs, which must be met to live a full and complete life. His theory is similar to those in the field of developmental psychology, which emphasizes how humans evolving directly correlates to not only their personality, but also how they function as human beings. The theory posits that humans must fulfill their needs in a specific order with their most primitive/basic needs met first to reach the highest level of the pyramid—self-actualization (Maslow, 1943, 1954).  The first four levels, considered contemporarily as the deficiency needs (D-needs), refers to physiological needs, safety and security needs, love and belongingness needs, self-worth and self-esteem. The first level—the most primitive/basic needs—include air, water, shelter, food, and sleep (1943, 1954). According to Maslow, the second level, safety and security needs, refers to an individual’s need to feel safe, 131  protected, and stable (Maslow, 1943, 1954). In the third level—love and belonging needs—Maslow (1943, 1954) states that individuals must feel a sense of validation and acknowledgement from those around them—place of employment, friendship, and family—to be able to build and maintain relationships accordingly. The fourth level is comprised of attaining esteem or the sense of feeling achievement, recognition, and earning the respect of others. The last section of the pyramid refers to the most complex of needs, or growth/being needs (B-needs) (Maslow, 1943, 1954). Self-actualization, the ultimate and most subjective need in Maslow’s theory, suggests that for an individual to be self-actualized, he/she must feel that he/she has reached his/her potential and feel a sense of fulfillment and growth (Maslow, 1943, 1954).  Maslow expanded on his original model in his 1970 text, Motivation and Personality to include “cognitive” and “aesthetic needs”. Maslow placed cognitive needs after esteem needs followed by aesthetic needs (Martin & Joomis, 2007). In 1969, Maslow further amended his model to add an eighth level, “self-transcendence,” as a motivational step beyond self-actualization (Koltko-Rivera, 2006). In the self-transcendence level, individuals “seek to further a cause beyond the self and to experience a communion beyond the boundaries of the self through peak experience” (Koltko-Rivera, 2006, p. 303). Maslow’s final level is the first to acknowledge that humans can function in ways beyond a narcissistic preoccupation. Even to this day, Maslow’s initial model, introduced in 1943, is used as a foundational theory to explain human needs.  132  Despite the importance of Maslow’s model, its deficiencies are noted when relating the model to the LGBTQ community: Table 3 Self-Actualization Needs Self-Actualization Needs Maslow refers to self-actualization as a sense of growth and fulfillment. Self-actualization, however, is contingent on the fulfillment of all the other categories of the model (Maslow, 1970). When relating self-actualization to the LGBTQ community, one must consider the difficulty and/or lack of attainment of the other fundamental needs as a result of the marginalization and alienation they face. Consequently, the fulfillment of this milestone is not impossible, but is rarely ever achieved (Rutledge 2011) .  Esteem Needs As a result of neglect and marginalization, many individuals from the LGBTQ community experience instances of bullying, are rejected from their families and live lives of conformity. Meyer (2013) found that compared with heterosexuals, those in the LGBTQ community “suffer from more mental health problems including substance abuse, affective disorders, and suicide” due to excess stress caused by stigma and prejudice (p. 24). Such factors directly affect the individual’s esteem preventing from moving forward and living full lives (2013).  Love/Belongingness Needs In an effort to fulfill love and belongingness needs, some individuals of the LGBTQ community live dual lives and restrain themselves from expressing their true selves in fear of being rejected and/or not accepted by their peers, family, and friends. This, in turn, leaves the individual with a sense of loneliness and is disconnected from their social nexus. Safety & Security Needs As a result of the alienation and marginalization experienced, members of the LGBTQ community migrated to haven cities such as San Francisco and New York in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Watson, 1998). A concern for safety and security is still prevalent for members of the LGBTQ community today as many cities in the United States lack the policies and laws to support them. Homophobic propaganda, lack of inclusion, and lack of access to equal employee benefits disrupt the lives of many members of the LGBTQ community (Miller, 2017).  Physiological Needs Throughout history, some members of the LGBTQ community have been deprived of some of the most basic of needs, physiological needs, as a result of neglect and lack of acceptance. The marginalization and alienation toward this community has resulted in stripping the community of the their basic human rights (Wolfe, 1994). When not met, such needs, have detrimental consequences on members of the community.  Maslow’s expansions to his original hierarchy suggest that the structure itself is not sufficient to explain human motivation in all circumstances, nor for all populations. Once a person has fulfilled their primitive needs—physiological and safety and security 133  needs, the others can then be attained. An argument can also be made that some of these needs support the attainment of others simultaneously, or that some needs can be partially fulfilled and/or temporarily achieved. Another deficiency of Maslow’s model is that physiological needs (food, water, shelter) must be met before any further needs can be attained as these needs are at the core of an individual’s need for survival (Maslow, 1943, 1954). In the case of individuals that identify as LGBTQ, attainment of physiological needs becomes problematic because these individuals are often deprived or are stripped of these basic needs as they come to terms with their identity (Wolfe, 1994). As has been demonstrated in this study, the “coming out experience” is one that at times is not supported or embraced by those that serve as caretakers for these individuals. As a result, factors such as homelessness, deprivation of food, and other basic needs may be lacking (1994). This, in turn, does not allow the individual to attain fulfillment of the subsequent levels in a linear fashion (Maslow, 1943; Maslow, 1954).  As needs are met and individuals advance through the hierarchy, the dependence on others to achieve fulfillment increases. When addressing safety and security needs, an individual’s safety and need for security are paramount to their well-being (Maslow, 1943; Maslow, 1954). As demonstrated in this paper, achieving safety and security for the LGBTQ community can be challenging. Instances such as the Matthew Shepard murder (the Wyoming teen who was brutally murdered by two men who offered him a ride and left him to die), the Jamie Nabozny lawsuit (the middle school student who was bullied, brutally beaten, and urinated on), (Turner, 2010) and the continued persecution of 134  the LGBTQ community in socially conservative spaces and through legitimate authority (e.g., legal exclusion from adoption practices, marriage and domestic partnerships), reveal that safety and security is, for some, a need that is difficult—if not impossible—to fulfill (Loffreda, 2000; Turner, 2010). Whether it be for fear of being discriminated against for self-expression, terminated from their place of employment due to intolerance, or enduring a physical assault at the hands of others, this is a primary concern for many individuals that identify as LGBTQ.  In the pursuit of the next level, the love/belonging and esteem needs, one must essentially be valued and recognized by others before being able to fulfill this category. However, Dr. Rutledge (2011) explains that, “Belongingness is the driving force of human behavior, not a third-tier activity”. Beyond the hierarchal nature of the model, another issue with fulfilling this need (or needs in general) is that “needs are not hierarchical [...] Needs are, like most other things in nature, an interactive, dynamic system, but they are anchored in our ability to make social connections (Rutledge, 2011).  For this very reason, the love/belonging and esteem needs are particularly difficult to achieve for those that that identify as LGBTQ—especially for teenagers and adults whom rely on peers and family for validation and acknowledgment. One such experience is when an LGBTQ individual considers “coming out” to his/her family and/or close friends. This decision may be strongly influenced by anticipated levels of support from these close individuals. Fear of being alienated and marginalized from one’s family and/or close friends may inhibit an individual from living an authentic life (Herek, 2004). In a society where LGBTQ individuals are being refused basic human rights and are 135  being “tolerated” rather than integrated, such categories, at times, become unreachable. Although many members of the LGBTQ community have led the charge in refusing to be devalued reasons including their economic, social or educational positions, and have led the way to bring about change in their community, marginalization and alienation is still prevalent and permeates amongst individuals in this community.  Another problem with Maslow’s hierarchy is the assumption that attaining self-actualization is a linear process. Self-actualization, the epitome of Maslow’s hierarchy, translates into complete fulfillment; it is the culmination of a well-rounded individual who must have met all previous levels of the pyramid to reach this level of ultimate success and knowledge (Rutledge, 2011). Whereas many cisgender individuals cope with issues regarding homelessness, lack of shelter, lack of security, a sense of marginalization and alienation, and low self-esteem, it is with the support and validation of their social nexus that they are able to address such deficiencies and overcome some—if not all of those obstacles. However, when the systems in place and those around you are creating and sustaining an environment that prevents many LGBTQ individuals to reach such levels of attainment, the application of the theory contradicts its goal. One could posit that some individuals may reject the requirement for external validation inherent in Maslow’s theory—though they might involuntarily desire it—because there may be issue with the sequential progression of Maslow’s concept of hierarchical needs as many of them, due to societal structures, are not able to fulfill them (Rutledge, 2011). In contrast, some members of the community may engage in causes of importance to their co-cultures and the larger culture, regardless of whether they have achieved levels three to six of the 136  hierarchy or not. The fight against AIDS, anti-bullying campaigns, and the support of human rights are among some of the larger culture causes that the LGBTQ community support and have rallied for in the past, in spite of many members of the LGBTQ community not necessarily having achieved the upper levels of the hierarchy. This activism demonstrates that large culture causes are intrinsically linked to multiple levels of the hierarchy. While there are several points of contention to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the model provides a base for pinpointing areas of conflict for an individual as well as for understanding human motivation. However, the theory is not as effective when addressing conflict in the community as a whole particularly the alienation and marginalization of the community—the theory is more apt for addressing intrapersonal conflicts. According to Maslow (1943, 1954), most conflicts are based on a misinterpretation of a lack of shared human needs. Once there is a realization that although in conflict, all parties share similar human needs, there is a greater opportunity and willingness from both parties to engage in conflict resolution. 137  Chapter 5: Conclusions This study has found that there is a need for a conflict resolution model that addresses the unique needs of the LGBTQ community. The selected conflict resolution theories can be beneficial or used as a starting point to analyze conflict, but they do not provide a detailed guide as to how address the conflicts that are unique to this community such as identity formation, (particularly “coming out”), and conforming to or performing to be in line with society’s standards. As a community that has experienced alienation and marginalization historically via structural and societal pressures, including physical violence, and ostracization, there is a need for a new and tailored conflict resolution approach that focuses on the LGBTQ community. Additionally, as mentioned in the analysis, factors such as identity and gender directly impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community. The practice of integration needs to be included and used in the literature when addressing the needs and/or conflicts within the LGBTQ community.   This study analyzed the applicability of structural violence, social cubism, and human needs theories, as conflict resolution theories for the selected population and how factors such as identity and gender impact a sense of integration. The different strengths and weaknesses of the three theories selected for this study are listed below to provide the reader a more holistic overview of the study conducted:  138  Table 4 Strengths and Weaknesses of Selected Conflict Resolution Theories Conflict Resolution Theory Strengths  Weaknesses Galtung’s Structural violence This theory explains the structural systems in place that are perpetuating the conflict. In doing so, it allows the individual seeking to resolve the conflict, a systematic and structural overview of what has to be addressed to resolve it (Galtung, 1969).  Structural violence is an explanatory framework, it does not present a solution nor a process to be followed for the conflict to be resolved.  However, it provides an in depth analysis of the conflict for action to be implemented towards its resolution. Moreover, there is usually more than one systematic barrier preventing a community from moving forward. As a result, because of its holistic approach, it is often difficult to pinpoint the main cause creating the conflict. (Galtung, 1969) Byrne & Carter’s Social Cubism Theory allows professional to view conflict from various perspectives that are interdependent and interrelated. This framework is dynamic  and provides the conflict resolutionist “a blueprint for conflict analysis that conflict theory suggests, but does not provide (McKay, 2002, p. 887) A limitation to the social cube is that it assumes that conflict has a linear nature. Time and space need to be included in the analysis of the conflict for its effective analysis and resolution.  (Matyok, Mendonza, & Schmitz, 2014.     Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs As this theory follows a hierarchy, it is clear to see where an individual may experience a deficiency allowing the professional to identify the conflict area(s) and determine an appropriate intervention (Maslow, 1970). Due to the structure and hierarchical nature of Maslow’s model, it does not account for the interdependent nature of the various needs an individual may be experiencing. In addition, it does not address the fact that some individuals may never be able to fulfill certain needs, especially those needs (love/belonging and esteem) that depend on the validation of others (Rutledge, 2011). Those that identify as LGBTQ may never experience validation from close family and friends. 139  Interconnectedness of Theories Both Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and social cubism depend on the concept of interconnectedness in order to achieve conflict resolution. In other words, these two theories posit that conflict can only be understood and resolved through others i.e., social connections. As a result, both theories depend on the interpersonal connections or lack thereof to achieve conflict resolution (Byrne & Carter, 1996; Maslow, 1943). When implementing these two theories with the LGBTQ community, it becomes challenging because the community is, at times, not supported by the heteronormative population thus straining the ability of these individuals to create, develop, and establish interpersonal connections especially with those outside of their community.  Social cubism offers a systematic overview of the factors (religious, historical, psychocultural, political, demographic, and economic factors) that create and/or maintain the conflict(s) and allows the conflict resolution professional to analyze these factors both individually and as a whole (Byrne & Carter, 1996). Similar to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the factors in social cubism are dependent on each other and must all be addressed accordingly to effectively solve conflict.  Like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and Byrne’s social cubism, Galtung’s structural violence provides the conflict resolutionist a holistic overview of the conflict being addressed. It allows for a detailed explanation of the conflict, its cause, and provides insight into the issues preventing it from being resolved (Galtung, 1969). Structural violence addresses the injustices that affect the LGBTQ community that are embedded in society, such as anti-LGBTQ policies, discrimination in the workplace, and negative 140  behaviors/lack of acceptance in society.  For structural violence to be an effective theory to resolve conflict in the LGBTQ community, systematic change would have to be implemented to the systems preventing the LGBTQ community from moving forward.  Unfortunately, none of the selected theories could be implemented as an effective conflict resolution theory for the LGBTQ community. Despite their capacity to explain conflict from various perspectives (social cubism), or the potential to address what systems are perpetuating the conflict (structural violence), or the ability to pinpoint the needs of an individual or group (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs), these theories are not sufficient to address the deep interpersonal conflicts experienced by members of this community. While the selected theories provide an explanatory framework to detail the source and/or cause of the conflict(s) and the ability to analyze conflict from various perspectives, neither of them address the steps let alone suggest an actionable resolution to the conflict. Strengths and Limitations The detailed explanation of the theories being used in this study: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, social cubism, and structural violence and their application to the LGBTQ community are a strength of this dissertation. In this study, the researcher provides the reader a detailed explanation of the three theories and their applicability to the LGBTQ community. Additionally, it provides the reader a historical account, with specific examples, of instances of how the LGBTQ community has been alienated and marginalized. The findings of this study add to the larger conversation surrounding the treatment of the LGBTQ community, both the intrapersonal and interpersonal conflicts 141  experienced, and how gender and identity play a role in such conflicts. Additionally, it provides the reader with a detailed overview of how the theorists that were researched for this study relate to the research questions of the study. As a result, it serves as a guide for future research on the topic of marginalization and alienations as well as identity and gender in the LGBTQ community from additional perspectives and lenses (e.g. performative acts and biological essentialism) A limitation of this dissertation is the need for additional information on the role integration plays in the LGBTQ community as compared to tolerance. Although the researcher provides information on this topic, the literature is limited and not much, if any, studies have been done to this effect. An additional limitation of this study is that, as mentioned earlier no subjects were interviewed. Although the literary sources were cross referenced to provide accuracy, one can argue that a phenomenological approach would have provided additional individual detail albeit subjective, to this study.  Contributions to the Field One of the contributions this dissertation makes to the study of conflict is the analysis of a conflict’s path from intrapersonal to interpersonal. As showcased throughout the study, based on the literature review and the analysis of the data, this study sheds light on how intrapersonal battles (e.g., thoughts of despair about one’s own gender identity) becoming expressed transform a conflict from an individual occurrence to an interpersonal experience (e.g., alienation as a result of non-conforming gender identity expressions). The levels of marginalization and alienation vary as a result of such expressions—the intrapersonal conflict also evolves—an individual may then ask 142  themselves if gender identity expression, moving into the interpersonal, is worth the cost of interpersonal conflict within their respective system or community. This is a contribution to the field of conflict analysis and resolution as it bridges the divide of two often-considered mutually exclusive sources of conflict. In addition, this study directly embeds concepts of Bem’s (2004) Biological Essentialism, Sedgwick’s (1990) views on sexuality, Butlers (1988) Performative Acts, Cooley and Mead’s (1969) Social Interactionism and Foucault’s notions of identity and power (1978) within the frame of intrapersonal and interpersonal conflict. Such connection allows the reader to further analyze these concepts as it relates to the LGBTQ community. Furthermore, this study reveals the prevalence of tolerance over integration in the current literature and highlights the need for additional research to be conducted. While theories that serve as explanatory frameworks in the field of conflict analysis and resolution exist, such as structural violence, Maslow’s hierarchy of heeds and social cubism, there is a need for a model to be created to resolve conflict experienced by the LGBTQ community instead of solely being analyzed.  Future Research & Recommendations The selected theories serve as a framework to explain the origins of the conflicts experienced within and by the LGBTQ community, and help to understand the dimensions of said conflicts. However, their role, from this researcher’s analysis, is still explanatory and analytical. Although the argument could certainly be made, that by better understanding the dimensions and origins of a conflict and how conflicts within and related to a community are developed and sustained, one is in a better position to identify 143  the most applicable practical framework that would aid in resolving these conflicts. As a result, a conflict resolution model that not only explains the origins of conflict, but also provides actionable steps and addresses the unique needs of the LGBTQ community will serve as a resource to the LGBTQ community. Such conflict model should address interpersonal and intrapersonal factors such as gender and identity, should consider inclusion and integration and be cognizant of the historical alienation and marginalization the LGBTQ community has and continues to face. In doing so, future researchers will be able to use this study as a framework to further develop the results and findings of this study.  As mentioned earlier, the unit of analysis for this research, was the LGBTQ community as a whole. This study did not focus on the individual subgroups of the community, that is lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and queers. Further research as it relates to the subgroups of this community is recommended in order to determine whether, as a result of such subgroups, the level of marginalization and alienation varies based on each individual subgroup.  An additional recommendation is to further analyze the LGBTQ community using social cubism as a lens when analyzing a conflict and its evolution through time. The level of alienation and marginalization experienced by this community has changed over time. As ideology and systems change, so does the root of the conflict as well as the weight of the various factors (sides of the cube).  144  Concluding Thoughts For years, the LGBTQ community, has been a population that I have admired and felt a connection toward. Through family and friends, I have been able to experience, the severe impact marginalization and alienation has had on individuals of this community. It is my hope that this study serves as a framework for other researchers to review and understand the need to create a model of conflict resolution with the LGBTQ community in mind. Although there have been many advances in recent history within the LGBTQ community, there is still a lot more that has to be done. A model of conflict resolution that allows for the LGBTQ community to feel integrated, validated, and acknowledged by others in society is a goal I wish this dissertation motivates other researchers to create.  145  References Adam, B.

    "abstract": "Members of the LGBT community have historically been victims of marginalization and alienation to various degrees. Incidents such as the Stonewall Riots, pride marches, and manifestos, among others, have served as a way for the LGBTQ community to attempt to take a stand against the systems in place that perpetuate inequality. Factors such as identity and gender have directly impacted the level to which individuals are shunned from their families, communities and social nexus. The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how factors such as identity and gender impact a sense of integration in the LGBTQ community. In addition, this dissertation aims to determine the applicability of three conflict resolution theories: Structural Violence, Social Cubism, and Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, to the LGBTQ community. This study analyzes the history of the LGBTQ community, identity formation theories, gender expectations in society, and factors that lead to alienation and marginalization. This dissertation is a qualitative study which utilizes case study methodology to analyze the existing literature related to the aforementioned topics. In this study, the reader is provided with a detailed explanation of the applicability of the three theories, including the role of factors such as identity, gender, and integration versus tolerance in the LGBTQ community. The study concludes with an analysis of the theories, recommendations for future research, and insight for those who aim to resolve conflict in the LGBTQ community",
